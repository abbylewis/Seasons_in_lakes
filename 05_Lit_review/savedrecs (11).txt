Parasites can significantly impact host mortality, growth performance, and reproductive success. This study examines the effects of the parasite Ligula pavlovskii (Diphyllobothriidae) on its host, the monkey goby (Neogobius fluviatilis), in Lake Balaton, Hungary. Both species originated in the Ponto-Caspian region, with the fish arriving in the 1970s and the parasite following in the 2000s. Our research reveals substantial impacts of L. pavlovskii on the life history of the monkey goby, including differences in somatic (condition, length) and reproductive (gonadosomatic index, fecundity, egg size) investments between infected and non-infected individuals. Condition declined with higher parasite index in infected individuals. Female GSI was influenced by both parasite presence and severity of the infection, whereas male GSI was affected by the presence of the parasite. Additionally, the length frequency distributions of infected and non-infected fish showed seasonal differences, due to the bigger body size of infected individuals in summer and autumn. The high prevalence of the parasite and associated mortality resulted in a significantly reduced expected lifespan for infected fish. Our findings suggest that the competitive advantage of N. fluviatilis may be reduced when this fish is infected by L. pavlovskii. This should be considered when developing management interventions for this species.

Based on Sr-Nd isotopic results, we argued that local weathered granitic residues were the dominant source of sediments throughout the past similar to 47.0 kyr. However, variations of Sr-87/Sr-86 and Nd-144/Nd-143 ratios were likely disturbed by the mixture of an additional input from Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). During some dry/cold millennial periods (e.g., Hein-rich event 5, 4, and 2, and the 26.0-24.0 kyr B.P), similar Sr-Nd isotopic signatures between the lake sediments and the fine fraction (<20 mu m) of the loess from CLP implied an aeolian dust source. Thus, variability of Sr-Nd isotopic ratios indirectly indicated two modes of climate patterns: the wet and warm intervals during which the sediments were mainly derived from the local weathered residues were expressed in increased Sr-87/Sr-86 and decreased Nd-144/Nd-143 ratios, whereas during the dry and cold intervals the increased input of fine dust from CLP transported by strengthened EAWM winds would favor declined Sr-87/Sr-86 and increased Nd-144/Nd-143 ratios. Our Sr-Nd isotopic records revealed an anti-phase between the EAWM and the summer monsoon, and displayed a good consistency with the record of mean grain size of quartz of loess from CLP, which was regarded as a reliable proxy of EAWM, suggested they can indirectly reflect variability of EAWM strength.					shang, shang/IYS-8177-2023; Wei, Zhiqiang/KDN-1700-2024														0016-7029	1556-1968				SEP	2022	60	9					877	890		10.1134/S0016702922090099	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0016702922090099		JUN 2022											WOS:000813577600001
J	Chen, RD; Wen, ZP; Lu, RY				Chen, Ruidan; Wen, Zhiping; Lu, Riyu			Interdecadal change on the relationship between the mid-summer temperature in South China and atmospheric circulation and sea surface temperature	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												South China suffers from high temperature frequently in mid-summer and this study aims to explore the interdecadal change of interannual variation of the mid-summer temperature in South China. It is revealed that the relationship between South China temperature and atmospheric circulation and sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) experiences an interdecadal change around the early 1990s. Before the early 1990s, warmer summer in South China is associated with the mid-latitude teleconnection featured by higher pressure over the Ural Mountains and the Korean Peninsula and lower pressure around the Lake Baikal. South China is located at the southern flank of an anomalous high pressure. After the early 1990s, South China temperature is prominently influenced by the tropical SSTA, and meanwhile the mid-latitude teleconnection becomes much weaker. Warmer summer is associated with higher pressure centered over South China and the El Nio to La Nia transition phase. The higher pressure influencing South China is located more southwards after the early 1990s, and it is favored by the tropical SSTA. The warmer SST in summer over the western tropical Pacific enhances the local convection and triggers an anomalous local Hadley cell with stronger subsidence over South China, directly leading to higher pressure over South China. Moreover, the colder SST over the central-eastern Pacific induces an anomalous Walker circulation and further strengthens the convection over the western tropical Pacific, exerting an indirect impact on the higher pressure over South China. The relative role of the western Pacific warming and central-eastern Pacific cooling is verified by CAM4 simulations. The intimate relationship between the tropical SSTA and South China temperature occurs during the El Nio to La Nia transition phase, which is the case after the early 1990s and suggests higher predictability for South China temperature in the recent decades.																			0930-7575	1432-0894				SEP	2018	51	5-6					2113	2126		10.1007/s00382-017-4002-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-017-4002-5													WOS:000442433200028

The eggs were obtained from a section of comb, containing both worker- and drone-sized cells, on which the queen was confined for 24 h. Egg length and width fluctuated significantly in both colonies throughout the experimental period. There was no statistical difference between sexes, and eggs destined to produce drones during the swarming season were not necessarily larger. Dry weights of drones were measured at 14-day intervals during spring (1990, Lake Placid, FL) and summer (1989 and 1990, Ithaca, NY), using a pool of 12-15 colonies. Weights varied significantly throughout all the sampling periods. The 1989 (NY) and 1990 (FL) data showed a tendency for drones to become lighter after swarming and heavier during swarming. The more extensive sampling in 1990 (NY) showed a mean drone dry weight varying from 56.86 mg to 30.71 mg, but there was no association with swarming and similar changes occurred also in worker weights.																			0021-8839						1992	31	3-4					114	118		10.1080/00218839.1992.11101271	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00218839.1992.11101271													WOS:A1992LM94000001

David; Hoch, Sebastian W.; Horel, John D.; Charland, Allison			Relationship between particulate air pollution and meteorological variables in Utah's Salt Lake Valley	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Critical meteorological factors affecting daily particulate concentrations during winter for Utah's urbanized Salt Lake Valley are examined on the basis of forty years of data. In a typical winter, the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) is exceeded during 6 multi-day events comprising 18 winter days. Multi-day episodes of high stability produce these events, as synoptic-scale high-pressure ridges transit across Utah. The valley heat deficit, a bulk measure of atmospheric stability, exhibits large winter-to-winter variations that are highly related to similar variations in PM2.5. While control strategies have led to downward trends in concentrations for some primary pollutants, no long-term trends in valley heat deficit are evident over the 40 years. PM2.5 concentrations rise gradually over a period of days after a heat deficit threshold is exceeded as the air within the valley becomes decoupled from generally stronger winds aloft. Concentrations climb at a typical rate of about 10 mu g m(-3) d(-1) over a four-day period to about 60 mu g m(-3) during these episodes. During episodes when PM2.5 concentrations exceed 35 mu g m(-3), the atmospheric column in the valley is characterized by: temperature below 0 degrees C; relative humidity in excess of 50%; and light wind speeds. PM2.5 concentrations in excess of 35 mu g m(-3) are four times more likely when the valley is snow covered than when it is not. A stepwise multiple linear regression based upon selected meteorological variables is used to estimate daily values of PM2.5 during two independent winters. The correlation between observed and estimated PM2.5 for these winters reaches 0.81. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study we report the results of five years' surveillance, conducted from January 2004 till June 2009, for detection of Perkinsosis and brown ring disease (BRD). The survey covered three sites of natural populations of Ruditapes decussatus in a Tunisian lagoon, the North Lake of Tunis. Perkinsosis was detected preferentially in winter periods from the external and marine site, BRD was detected more frequently in the summer periods in a more proximal collection site (in the lake) and was positively correlated with concentrations of heterotrophic Vibrio sp. Our results suggest that several factors other than temperature and salinity might explain spatial distribution variability and natural intensities for these infections in carpet shell clam populations.

After 11750 cal. yr BP, a warming climate coupled with enhanced summer monsoon precipitation results in the expansion of Tsuga and evergreen broadleaved trees (Cyclobalanopsis, Lithocarpus and Castanopsis). An increase in evergreen oaks and dry-tolerant species after 10 320 cal. yr BP suggests a greater seasonality in rainfall, reflecting a southward shift in the winter front across the region. This trend of increasing temperatures and seasonality is seen to continue through into the mid-Holocene and the onset of the Holocene optimum. A marked decline in arboreal taxa coupled with increased levels of grass (Poaceae) and other disturbance taxa provides the first evidence for human impact in the catchment at c. 6370 cal. yr BP This early phase of forest clearance leads to the collapse of the natural altitudinal vegetation gradient that existed in the catchment from the Lateglacial. The subsequent expansion of secondary pine forest suggests that these early clearances were part of a sustained period of shifting agriculture. Archaeological and historical records for the region point to a gradual increase in immigration into the region throughout the late Holocene. The increased pressure on the catchment is reflected in the pollen record by a series of clearance phases, which increase in intensity after 2140 cal. yr BP, linked presumably to intensification of agriculture and early urbanization. This trend continues through the last millennium, before a sharp increase in arboreal pollen at the top of the core reflects a phase of reforestation that took place in the catchment over the last 25 years.					; Dearing, John/E-4206-2010	Dearing, John/0000-0002-1466-9640; Shen, Ji/0000-0001-9143-5648; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				MAR	2006	16	2					265	276		10.1191/0959683606hl923rp	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683606hl923rp													WOS:000236606600010
J	RICHARDSON, GM; CURRIE, DJ				RICHARDSON, GM; CURRIE, DJ			ESTIMATING FISH CONSUMPTION RATES FOR ONTARIO AMERINDIANS	JOURNAL OF EXPOSURE ANALYSIS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY												The routine assessment of human exposure to contaminants requires that exposure via consumption of freshwater fish be considered because many chemicals persist and/or bioaccumulate in fish. Estimates offish consumption rate were determined for Ontario Amerindians from data on the concentration of mercury in the hair of 4,327 Amerindians residing in 58 reserves across the province, combined with data on mercury concentrations in three commonly consumed species offish collected from lakes surrounding these reserves. Estimated rates offish consumption were found to differ between sexes, with males consuming a geometric mean of 19 g offish per day, while females were estimated to consume a geometric mean of 14 g/day. Fish consumption rate was found to increase with increasing latitude, a surrogate measure of community isolation, and to increase with age. Seasonal variation was also noted, with fish consumption rates being highest during summer months and lowest in winter. These data may provide regulatory agencies with a more statistically representative basis upon which to establish assumptions concerning fish consumption rates for risk assessment purposes. Factors such as the location of the exposed population, age and sex of exposed individuals, and time of year in which an assessment is being conducted, should also be considered as specific situations require.

J	Hashimoto, H; Sugawa, H				Hashimoto, Hiroshi; Sugawa, Hisashi			Population trends of wintering Eurasian Coot Fulica atra in East Asia	ORNITHOLOGICAL SCIENCE												The range of Eurasian Coot Fulica atra in Japan has expanded gradually since the 1980s, and the numbers of coot wintering at several sites in Japan have increased. In this paper, we summarize the trends in coot numbers wintering in Japan and mainland East Asia. In Japan, wintering numbers of coot have increased in most regions, except in northern Chiba Prefecture. The increase began in the late 1990s or around 2000 at several water bodies in the Kanto, Chubu, Kinki and Chugoku regions of Honshu. It also increased in the mid-2000s at several water bodies in the Tohoku, Kanto, Chubu, and Kinki regions of Honshu, and perhaps also on the island of Kyushu. In China, huge numbers of coot overwintered at several sites in the lower Yangtze floodplain (e.g., Poyang Lake, Dongting Lake) and along the Jiangsu Coast near the Yangtze River mouth (e.g., Yancheng Nature Reserve, Hongze Hu Lake) during the 1990s. However, during the 2000s, no sites in China held more than 10,000 wintering coot. The number of coot wintering in coastal south China has also decreased. In South Korea, the number of wintering coot has increased especially since the mid-2000s. The increases in the populations of wintering coot in central and western Japan and in South Korea seem to be mainly as a result of changes in coot populations and/or habitats outside Japan. We suggest two possible causes: the breeding population of coot on the East Asian mainland may have increased, or some coot that used to overwinter in China may have begun wintering in Japan and South Korea.																			1347-0558					DEC	2013	12	2					91	105		10.2326/osj.12.91	http://dx.doi.org/10.2326/osj.12.91													WOS:000330926400003

This study explores the role of the zonal shift of the Asian westerly jet (AWJ) core on the spatial-temporal variability of EASM precipitation based on Holocene climate simulations using the KCM and CESM forced by orbital variations. We analyzed the composite differences of summer precipitation and associated atmospheric circulations between the early (middle) and middle (late) Holocene. Simulations suggest a dipole pattern of summer precipitation with increasing (decreasing) precipitation in central (southern) China from the early to late Holocene, which was shaped by the eastward shift of the AWJ core. The eastward shift of the AWJ core and the accompanied eastward movement of the upper-level convergence over the AWJ's right exit region weakened the low-level downward motions over central China. Meanwhile, the low-level upward motions over southern China were weakened by the concurrent eastward (westward) migration of the South Asian High (western Pacific subtropical High) during the Holocene. Consequently, summer precipitation increased (decreased) in central (southern) China from the early to late Holocene. The eastward shift of the AWJ core was primarily driven by amplified meridional insolation gradient at middle latitudes via strengthening upper-level westerly intensity during the Holocene. In addition, land cover difference between East Asia and central Asia caused a greater enhancement of westerlies intensity in East Asia, further modulating the eastward movement of the AWJ core during the Holocene.

Persistent Nitrate in Alpine Waters with Changing Atmospheric Deposition and Warming Trends	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Nitrate concentrations in high-elevation lakes of the Colorado Front Range remain elevated despite declining trends in atmospherically deposited nitrate since 2000. The current source of this elevated nitrate in surface waters remains elusive, given shifts in additional nitrogen sources via glacial inputs and atmospheric ammonium deposition. We present the complete isotopic composition of nitrate (delta N-15, delta O-18, and Delta O-17) from a suite of nitrate-bearing source waters collected during the summers of 2017-2018 from two alpine ecosystems to constrain the provenance of elevated nitrate in surface waters during the summer open-water season. The results indicate a consistent contribution of uncycled atmospheric nitrate throughout the summer (13-23%) to alpine lakes, despite seasonal changes in source water inputs. The balance of nitrate (as high as 87% in late summer) is likely from nitrate production within the catchment via nitrification of reduced nitrogen sources (e.g., thawed soil organic matter and ammonium deposition) and released with rock glacier meltwater. The role of microbially produced nitrate has become increasingly important over time based on historical surface water samples from the mid-90s to present, a trend coincident with increasing ammonium deposition to alpine systems.

Tundra Browning in the Indigirka Lowlands (North-Eastern Siberia) Explained by Drought, Floods and Small-Scale Vegetation Shifts	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Contrary to the general "greening of the Arctic", the Siberian Indigirka Lowlands show strong "browning" (a decrease in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index or "NDVI") in various recent satellite records. Since greening and browning are generally indicative of increases and losses in photosynthetically active biomass, this browning trend may have implications for the carbon balance and vegetation of this Arctic tundra region. To explore potential mechanisms responsible for this trend break from general Arctic greening, we studied timeseries of Landsat summer maximum NDVI, weather data, and high-resolution maps of vegetation compositional change, topography, geomorphology and hydrology. We find that a significant proportion of browning (lower summer NDVI) is explained by moisture dynamics, with high snow depths and resulting floods as well as summer drought coinciding with low NDVI. Relations between seasonal weather variables and NDVI are spatially heterogeneous, with floodplains, drained thaw lake basins and Yedoma ridges showing different patterns of association with weather variables. Low summer NDVI after high snowfall was particularly evident in floodplains, likely explained by early summer floods. Local small-scale vegetation changes explained only small amounts of variance in browning rates in Landsat NDVI. Local expansion of Sphagnum vegetation in particular may have contributed to recent browning of our study site, but higher resolution NDVI timeseries are necessary to accurately constrain the role of small-scale vegetation shifts. Overall, associations identified in this study suggest that future increases in Arctic precipitation variability and extremes may limit tundra greening, but to different extents even across comparatively small topographical contrasts.

Therefore, the present study aims to elucidate the effect of the total dissolved/dispersed petroleum hydrocarbons (TDDPHs) on Cerastoderma glaucum (Bivalvia: Cardiidae) in Lake Timsah. Seasonal investigations were carried out at two sites during 2007. The TDDPHs were measured in soft tissues and shell of C. glaucum, water and sediment samples using spectrofluorometric analysis. Also, gas chromatographic analysis was carried out to detect the polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Results revealed the TDDPHs content were high in male individuals than females, and were also more representative in the cockles' soft tissues than in its shells. Soft tissues of C. glaucum and sediment samples recorded significant differences during seasons and between the two sites. A negative correlation was found between TDDPHs content in soft tissues of C. glaucum and its age. The highest level of TDDPHs content in soft tissues (21.3 mu g/g) was recorded at age of one year, while the lowest one (4.82 mu g/g) was observed at age of five years. Concentration factor (CF) studied showed higher value in sediment during spring and in soft tissues during autumn. Gas chromatographic analysis (GC) clarified that PAHs accumulated in soft tissues were of high molecular weight (HMW) which represent hazard effect on marine organisms.					; mohammad, Samya/ABD-4667-2020	The International Journal of Environmental Sciences, Catrina/0009-0004-0194-3219; 													1687-5052	2090-2786					2009	4	1					21	30																WOS:000451031700002

In this study, climate and vegetation 6000 years (6 ka) ago is investigated using one global climate model, two regional climate models, one dynamical vegetation model, pollen-based reconstruction of past vegetation cover using a model of the pollen-vegetation relationship and a statistical model for spatial interpolation of the reconstructed land cover. This approach enables us to study 6 ka climate with potential natural and reconstructed land cover, and to determine how differences in land cover impact upon simulated climate. The use of two regional climate models enables us to discuss the robustness of the results. This is the first experiment with two regional climate models of simulated palaeo-climate based on regional climate models. Different estimates of 6 ka vegetation are constructed: simulated potential vegetation and reconstructed vegetation. Potential vegetation is the natural climate-induced vegetation as simulated by a dynamical vegetation model driven by climate conditions from a climate model. Bayesian spatial model interpolated point estimates of pollen-based plant abundances combined with estimates of climate-induced potential un-vegetated land cover were used for reconstructed vegetation. The simulated potential vegetation is heavily dominated by forests: evergreen coniferous forests dominate in northern and eastern Europe, while deciduous broadleaved forests dominate central and western Europe. In contrast, the reconstructed vegetation cover has a large component of open land in most of Europe. The simulated 6 ka climate using reconstructed vegetation was 0-5 degrees C warmer than the pre-industrial (PI) climate, depending on season and region. The largest differences are seen in north-eastern Europe in winter with about 4-6 degrees C, and the smallest differences (close to zero) in southwestern Europe in winter. The simulated 6 ka climate had 10-20% more precipitation than PI climate in northern Europe and 10-20% less precipitation in southern Europe in summer. The results are in reasonable agreement with proxy-based climate reconstructions and previous similar climate modelling studies. As expected, the global model and regional models indicate relatively similar climates albeit with regional differences indicating that, models response to land-cover changes differently. The results indicate that the anthropogenic land-cover changes, as given by the reconstructed vegetation, in this study are large enough to have a significant impact on climate. It is likely that anthropogenic impact on European climate via land-use change was already taking place at 6 ka. Our results suggest that anthropogenic land-cover changes at 6 ka lead to around 0.5 degrees C warmer in southern Europe in summer due to biogeophysical forcing. (C) 2022 The Authors.

Lake ice ablation rates from permanently ice-covered Antarctic lakes	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												In the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, three large, permanently ice-covered, closed-basin lakes exist along the floor of Taylor Valley. Lake ice ablation (loss of ice mass) is calculated as the sum of sublimation and surface melt, and is the driver of ice-cover turnover in these systems. In Taylor Valley, both manual and automated lake ice ablation rates have been calculated from 2001 to 2011. Results indicate relatively consistent winter ablation of 0.07-0.21 m (0.2-0.7 mm w.e.d(-1)). Summer ablation of lake ice is more variable and ranges from 0.25 to 1.62 m (5-31 mm w.e.d(-1)) over an average 51 day period. Previous to this study, ablation rates have been cited as 0.35 m a(-1) in the dry valleys from sublimation modeling based on meteorological variables. We show that this value has significantly underestimated mean ablation and ice-cover turnover on the Taylor Valley lakes.

In this study, we reconstruct the changes in monsoon precipitation and mean annual temperature simultaneously over the past 16,000 years using multiple proxies, including isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (isoGDGTs) and n-alkanes, from an alpine lake in southwestern China. On the one hand, the reconstructed monsoon precipitation shows a long-term increasing trend during the last deglaciation and a gradual decrease during the Holocene, with the highest-humidity period occurring in the early Holocene. Our result displays good consistency with the changes in regional mean annual precipitation, summer precipitation, and monsoon intensity during the last deglaciation and the Holocene. On the other hand, the reconstructed mean annual temperature inferred from the n-alkane proxy shows a long-term warm trend since the last deglaciation. Our result is consistent with the regional reconstruction of both mean annual and summer temperatures during the last deglaciation, while evident seasonal differences were observed for Holocene records with a cooling trend of summer temperature and a warm trend of mean annual temperature. Comprehensive comparison reveals that monsoon precipitation in the Indian monsoon region is mainly related to changes in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and land-sea thermal contrast controlled by boreal summer insolation. In addition, the increase in temperature during deglaciation is primarily attributed to the escalation of greenhouse gases (GHGs), while the divergent trend of seasonal temperature during the Holocene is mainly attributed to the changes in local seasonal insolation. Our research emphasizes that monsoon precipitation is a summer signature in the Indian monsoon region, which is consistent with the changes in summer temperature, while contrasting with the changes in mean annual temperature. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the seasonal difference in temperature changes when investigating the hydrothermal combination in Indian monsoon regions.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				MAR 1	2024	637								111991	10.1016/j.palaeo.2023.111991	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2023.111991		JAN 2024											WOS:001153833900001

Phosphorus inputs to lake simcoe from 1990 to 2003: Declines in tributary loads and observations on lake water quality	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Total phosphorus (TP) inputs to Lake Simcoe have led to hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO) depletion and loss of cold water fish habitat. Since 1990, efforts have been made to reduce the total TP input to the lake below a defined target of 75 t/year, which was predicted to lead to reductions in spring TP concentration and improvements in end-of-summer hypolimnetic DO concentrations. The total TP load to the lake during the most recent period of record (1998/99-2003/04) ranged from 53 to 76 t/yr and averaged 67 thr, compared to an average of 114 t/yr estimated between 1990191 and 1997198 (range 85-157 t/yr). Reductions in TP loads from the catchment via tributary discharge (similar to 26 t) accounted for the majority of the decrease in total load between the two time periods. Total P concentrations decreased significantly; in four out of six long-term monitored tributaries; however, concentrations in all six tributaries remain above the level recommended to avoid nuisance plant growth (30 mu g/L). Although TP loads to the lake are currently below the target 75 t/yr, excessive growths of filamentous algae and macrophytes continue to be a problem in the nearshore zone. End-of-summer minimum hypolimnetic DO concentrations (average 4.3 m/L, 1998/9-2003/4) remain substantially below the level (7 mg/L) that is considered protective of lake trout. Efforts to reduce TP loads to the lake therefore need to continue.

The contribution of the phantom midge Chaoborusflavicans to the unconventional seasonal dynamics of cladocerans was studied. The seasonal development of the C. flavicans population and the zooplankton community was studied together with food consumption by chaoborids and the most common vertebrate predator, smelt. The population density of Chaoborus peaked in June and collapsed in mid summer. Thereafter, another peak occurred at the end of August. The maximum density of chaoborids in the water column varied between 5,500 and 8,700 ind./m(2). In early summer, the most common food items of Chaoborus were bosminids while later in summer the share of daphnids increased. Food consumption by the Chaoborus population peaked at 26-46 mugCl(-1) d(-1) in June and clearly exceeded the production rate of cladocerans. Cladoceran consumption by smelt population reached its maximum, 1.13 mug Cl-1 d(-1), in early July. Cladocerans showed a 20-40 mug C/l biomass peak in July-August, coincidently with the minimum density of chaoborids. When predation pressure decreased, the mean size of cladocerans increased at 10-15 m, the depth occupied by chaoborids during daytime. The results suggest that in early summer the high predation pressure prevents cladocerans from reaching a sufficient body length to defend them against Chaoborus and that the timing of the cladoceran biomass peak is determined by the relaxation of chaoborid predation.																			0003-9136					AUG	2003	158	1					75	96		10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0158-0075	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0158-0075													WOS:000185845700005

Based on the system, a heat transfer model was established for cast heat exchanger (CHE) adopted by SWHP systems. The CHE consists of pipes immersed in the seawater and used for transferring heat between the seawater and the heat exchanger pipes of SWHP system. An experimental study was carried out to test the validity of the model. A program was developed in VB language and the effects of inlet temperature, flow rate of the secondary refrigerant and length of CHE on the results were investigated. The results of the numerical simulation are in consistence with the experiments in both winter and summer conditions. As a result, application of SWHP systems with CHE in coastal areas in China is feasible due to the favorable geographical conditions and environment.

J	Cheng, KS; Lei, TC				Cheng, KS; Lei, TC			Reservoir trophic state evaluation using Landsat TM images	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Reservoir water quality is traditionally monitored and evaluated based on field data. Collecting and analyzing field water quality data are costly and time consuming tasks, and whether a limited number of field data truly characterize the spatial variation of the trophic state within a vast water body is often disputed. In this study we utilize Landsat TM data to estimate the water quality and trophic state of the Te-Chi reservoir in Central Taiwan. A modified multi-parameter model of Carlson's trophic state index (TSI) was developed for the Te-chi reservoir. Water quality parameters (concentration of chlorophyll-a, total phosphorous measurement, and secchi disk depth) required by the model are found to have high correlations with combinations of TM bands. Therefore, TM data are used to map the trophic state of the reservoir. TM-derived TSI maps of the reservoir reveal that, in summer, the trophic state in the reservoir generally improves from upstream to downstream and that zones of distinct trophic state exist. Atrophic state index based on secchi disk depth may give erroneous values in the upstream section of the reservoir pool due to high sediment concentration in the reservoir inflow. We conclude that the Te-Chi reservoir is eutrophic or worse in summer and meso-eutrophic in winter. Implementation of best management practices to reduce nonpoint source pollution in the upstream watershed is highly recommended. This study demonstrates the capability of mapping the trophic state in impounded water bodies using the Landsat TM data.

Despite its biotic richness the mire is in a slow state of deterioration, initiated by man several hundred years ago. Evidence has been found that drainage occurred in an originally treeless percolating mire (sloping fen), possibly as a result of hydrological changes in a lower lying lake. The development of the springs was probably a reaction to the increased resistance to water flow in the percolating mire, forcing the groundwater to discharge high up at the sand borders. The eroding effect of the spring water courses increased the drainage and, although the springs also provided new habitats for rare moss communities, a considerable eutrophication in the present spring alder wood can be noticed.					van Diggelen, Rudy/HKN-8892-2023; Grootjans/I-1638-2012; Wolejko, Leslaw/M-7182-2016; Aggenbach, Camiel/AAE-3298-2021														0023-3374					JUN 20	1994	97	2					219	245																WOS:A1994NX78800004

Years of anomalously high sediment yield from the Green Lake watershed were identified over a 70-year period (1930-2000) based on whole-lake varve deposit volumes. Intra-annual sediment delivery events were categorized and described for those anomalous years using historical hydroclimatic data and the stratigraphic record observed within inflow proximal sediment cores. Extreme sediment delivery coincided with high discharge conditions and elevated sediment availability resulting from (1) rapid glacier recession of the early twentieth century, (2) late-summer and autumn rainstorm-generated floods, and (3) freshet floods caused by unusual snowmelt conditions. The thickness and physical characteristics of varves vary among years that experienced different types of moderate and extreme sediment delivery events in relation to the defined average-regime depositional model. Several hydroclimatic factors can interact to produce composite varve units of anomalous thickness. In some cases, geomorphic events, such as landslides and channel changes, contributed to extreme sediment delivery in the Green Lake catchment. The interaction of these geomorphic effects, coupled with the variable nature of associated hydroclimatic functions, complicate paleoenvironmental assessments based on the lacustrine varve record.

Existing studies often rely on single-source interpolated inputs and conventional evaluation metrics, which constrain the understanding of internal interactions within hydrological subsystems. To address this gap, we employ a multi-source data framework combined with an information-theoretic approach to assess hydrological process connectivity and causal relationships in the Ebinur Basin of northwestern China. We applied the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, enhanced with glacier dynamics, using three station-interpolated datasets and one satellite-based reanalysis product. Transfer entropy was utilized to capture directional dependencies between hydrological variables across seasonal and temporal scales. Results indicate that satellite-based and interpolated datasets produce contrasting spatial and seasonal patterns of water fluxes. Evapotranspiration and runoff dominate in summer and autumn, while snow water equivalent exhibits weak causal coupling. Transfer entropy provided more detailed insights than traditional correlation methods, particularly in identifying information flow between runoff and soil moisture. These findings highlight the importance of integrating information-theoretic diagnostics and multi-source data for improving hydrological understanding and prediction in data-scarce, environmentally sensitive arid basins.					qingling, bao/GPW-9450-2022															2624-9375				AUG 26	2025	7								1622980	10.3389/frwa.2025.1622980	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2025.1622980													WOS:001566268400001

In the fall, egg nets and traps were deployed on different substrate types, and in the spring, fry traps were used to capture newly emergent fry. Fry were only captured in an area approximately 50 by 10 m at the north end of the eastern edge of the reef. Eggs were only captured in nets and traps deployed near this area, or in nets and traps which moved over this area during storms and came to rest at the base of the reef. The area of Stony Island reef actually used by lake trout for egg deposition appeared to be extremely limited relative to the entire reef. This area was characterized by large cobble substrate with minimal infilling by sand and fines. Thus, hatchery-origin lake trout appeared to recognize substrate appropriate for successful egg incubation.

No feeding was observed at any time during the winter, and examination of gallbladder coloration indicated that feeding had not occurred for a long period of time. Proximate composition analysis of nonreproductive charr from Koroc River indicated that liver and muscle lipid and liver protein reserves changed during the winter fast, and this was most pronounced in early winter. Spent charr sampled at Lake Tasikallak had lower liver lipid and condition factor values and were more depleted than nonreproductive charr. Despite a reduction in lipids and protein during winter, the general condition of nonreproductive charr renders them suitable for commercial sale at any time of the year.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				NOV	1990	68	11					2284	2289		10.1139/z90-319	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z90-319													WOS:A1990EH96300009
J	Noges, T; Noges, P				Noges, T; Noges, P			The effect of extreme water level decrease on hydrochemistry and phytoplankton in a shallow eutrophic lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Conference on Trophic Interactions in Shallow Freshwater and Brackish Waterbodies	AUG 03-08, 1998	BLOSSIN, GERMANY	Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisher, Tech Univ Cottbus				A drought-induced drastic decrease in mean depth and volume brought about several effects in the ecosystem of L. Vortsjarv (270 km(2)). Differences in alkalinity, Si and inorganic N in two consecutive winters can be attributed to the concentration effect resulting from different ice/water volume ratios in the lake. Smaller initial amount of oxygen that remained under the ice in winter 1995/96 accounted largely for the observed anoxia. Increase in phytoplankton biovolume represented another concentration effect, as a similar areal primary production in 1995 and 1996 resulted in about twice a higher density of algal crop in the summer of 1996, when the average amount of water in the lake was 1.7 times smaller. Due to a better mixing of shallow water, integral oxygen concentration during the ice-free period in 1996 was systematically higher than in 1995. Stronger sediment resuspension in 1996 enriched the water with suspended solids and nutrients, resulting in a slight increase in the trophic state. Lower water level in 1996 improved light conditions by `cutting off' less illuminated and less productive deep layers. This was probably one of the main factors which caused the collapse of the common dominants Limnothrix redekei and L. planctonica and initiated mass development (max. 36 g m(-3))of Cyanonephron styloides. The observed changes in the phytoplankton composition in 1996 could be caused also by the selective grazing of larger zooplankton.

A survey of thirty-two rheocrene springs in central Pennsylvania revealed that, like Gammarus in lakes and streams, Gammarus minus is absent from springs with pH < 6.0 and conductivity <25 muS cm-1 (total range in pH = 4.6-7.7, and in conductivity =14-411 muS cm-1). 2. In ten springs G. minus density was positively correlated with Ca2+ and Mg2+ hardness, but not with pH, unless three springs with either an exceptionally high velocity or extremely high densities of the potentially competing snail Fontigens nickliniana were omitted. 3. Adults were larger in the springs with few or no large predators than in those with more predators. In all ten springs, adult dry mass was unrelated to spring pH and ionic content, but brooding female dry mass covaried positively with Ca2+ and Mg2+ hardness in the five predator-poor springs. 4. Body water, Na and Ca contents and body mass/length ratios varied independently of spring pH and ionic content. Water content was inversely correlated with fat content, but even when expressed as a percentage of fat-free wet mass, it was unrelated to water chemistry. 5. In juveniles, males and non-brooding females, fat content varied independently of spring pH and ionic content, but in brooding females it was correlated with alkalinity and Ca2+ and Mg2+ hardness. The cost of reproduction in brooding females may have been a factor here; they had significantly lower per cent fat than did non-brooding females. juvenile fat content did not differ significantly among spring populations, whereas adult fat content did. The per cent fat of brooding females covaried positively with body size among springs, and this was marginally true for non-brooding females, as well. The residuals of brooding female per cent fat against dry mass were not related to water chemistry. 6. Brood size (number of embryos in a brood) and brood mass varied significantly among populations, but independently of spring pH and ionic content. Both covaried positively with maternal body size among springs. The residuals of these relationships were unrelated to water chemistry, as was the percentage of females brooding. 7. G. minus from a pH 6 spring survived better and lost less body mass in acidic soft water than did those from a pH 7.6 spring. However, although G. minus has apparently been able to adapt (or acclimate) to pH 6 water it has failed to adapt to more acidic waters. A physiological or structural constraint may be involved because this species has probably had ample opportunity to evolve resistance to dilute acidic water. This hypothesis is consistent with the threshold effect observed: above pH 6 G. minus shows very little evidence of osmotic or metabolic stress, but below pH 6 viable populations apparently cannot survive at all. However, the gradual linear decrease in population density of G. minus with decreasing affinity and Ca2+ and Mg2+ hardness suggests that other factors may also be involved (e.g. a decrease in food quality).

Snow-covered Landsat time series stacks improve automated disturbance mapping accuracy in forested landscapes	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Accurate landscape-scale maps of forests and associated disturbances are critical to augment studies on biodiversity, ecosystem services, and the carbon cycle, especially in terms of understanding how the spatial and temporal complexities of damage sustained from disturbances influence forest structure and function. Vegetation change tracker (VCT) is a highly automated algorithm that exploits the spectral-temporal properties of summer Landsat time series stacks (LTSSs) to generate spatially explicit maps of forest and recent forest disturbances. VCT performs well in contiguous forest landscapes with closed or nearly closed canopies, but often incorrectly classifies large patches of land as forest or forest disturbance in the complex and spatially heterogeneous environments that typify fragmented forest landscapes. We introduce an improved version of VCT (dubbed VCTw) that incorporates a nonforest mask derived from snow-covered winter Landsat time series stacks (LTSSw) and compare it with VCT across nearly 25 million ha of land in the Lake Superior (Canada, USA) and Lake Michigan (USA) drainage basins. Accuracy assessments relying on 87 primary sampling units (PSUs) and 2640 secondary sampling units (SSUs) indicated that VCT performed with an overall accuracy of 86.3%. For persisting forest, the commission error was 14.7% and the omission error was 4.3%. Commission and omission errors for the two forest disturbance classes fluctuated around 50%. VCTw produced a statistically significant increase in overall accuracy to 91.2% and denoted about 1.115 million ha less forest (-.371 million ha disturbed and -0.744 million ha persisting). For persisting forest, the commission error decreased to 9.3% and the omission error was relatively unchanged at 5.0%. Commission errors decreased considerably to near 22% and omission errors remained near 50% in both forest disturbance classes. Dividing the assessments into three geographic strata demonstrated that the most dramatic improvement occurred across the southern half of the Lake Michigan basin, which contains a highly fragmented agricultural landscape and relatively sparse deciduous forest, although substantial improvements occurred in other geographic strata containing little agricultural land, abundant wetlands, and extensive coniferous forest. Unlike VCT, VCTw also generally corresponded well with field-based estimates of forest cover in each stratum. Snow-covered winter imagery appears to be a valuable resource for improving automated disturbance mapping accuracy. About 34% of the world's forests receive sufficient snowfall to cover the ground and are potentially suitable for VCTw; other season-based techniques may be worth pursuing for the remaining 66%.

J	Schmitt, M; Nixdorf, B				Schmitt, M; Nixdorf, B			Spring phytoplankton dynamics in a shallow eutrophic lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Conference on Trophic Interactions in Shallow Freshwater and Brackish Waterbodies	AUG 03-08, 1998	BLOSSIN, GERMANY	Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisher, Tech Univ Cottbus				In contrast to other eutrophic shallow lakes in the Scharmutzelsee region, a delayed onset of the phytoplankton succession in Lake Melangsee during spring was regularly observed. Biomasses were opposed to the carrying capacity of the lake (calculated from total-P, total-N and underwater light), indicating further regulating factors in spring. This phase was characterised by high Secchi depths, rising flushing and enhanced oxygen concentrations at the lake bottom. Although silicate concentrations decreased in spring, a typical pelagic diatom or cyanobacterial bloom did not develop. Therefore, we frame the hypothesis that a combination of abiotic factors such as increased losses in spring due to higher flushing and a better light supply suppresses pelagic growth and favours benthic diatoms, which outcompete pelagic diatoms for silicate. The vertical oxygen distribution in this period indicates a shift from pelagic primary production to benthic growth. Considering primary production, flushing, under water light supply and nutrients we tried to find the reasons for the depression of phytoplankton growth during spring.																			0018-8158						1999	408						269	276		10.1023/A:1017096210578	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017096210578													WOS:000084892400029

Long-term trends in seasonal plankton dynamics in Lake Mead (Nevada-Arizona, USA) and implications for climate change	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Over the past few decades, Lake Mead (Nevada-Arizona, USA) has experienced multiple ecosystem stressors including drought, increased water demand, and establishment of invasive species (quagga mussels, gizzard shad). Despite these potential stressors, zooplankton and phytoplankton community dynamics in the pelagic regions of Lake Mead have generally followed consistent seasonal patterns. Long-term monitoring results (2007-2015) show that zooplankton and phytoplankton communities remain relatively stable in Lake Mead on an inter-annual basis, but are susceptible to shifts caused by extreme climate fluctuations and alterations in mixing regimes. A warm winter characterized by low snowpack in 2014/2015 preceded a large bloom of toxic cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa Kutzing) in Las Vegas Bay the following summer. Large bloom events are rare in Lake Mead; however, under future climate scenarios, these types of events may become more frequent. Because of the consistency of plankton community dynamics over an extended period of time, Lake Mead offers an ideal system for the study of future climate change impacts. This study aims to characterize the response of plankton communities in Lake Mead to both linear and dynamic environmental changes.

A high-resolution record of climate, vegetation, and fire in the mixed conifer forest of northern Colorado, USA	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												High-resolution pollen, charcoal, delta C-13, total organic carbon (TOC), and magnetic susceptibility data from sediment cores from a montane lake in northern Colorado record variations in vegetation, fire history, and sedimentation since 14.5 ka (1 ka = 1000 cal yr B. P.). This record shows warm conditions during the Bolling-Allerod and the coldest conditions in this area during the Younger Dryas event. Warming occurred throughout the early and middle Holocene, lasting until ca. 5 ka, when the warmest and wettest summer conditions were recorded. Progressive climate cooling and enhanced winter precipitation are then observed until present day. These long-term climatic trends correlate to changes in summer insolation. Charcoal accumulation rates (CHAR) increased along with the arboreal vegetation, from minima in the Late Glacial period to maxima during the early and middle Holocene, suggesting that charcoal influx was also controlled by climate and vegetation. TOC and delta C-13 show a progressive increase and a decrease trend during the late Pleistocene and Holocene, respectively, related to changes in vegetation and productivity in the lake. Major peaks in the CHAR record correspond with peaks in magnetic susceptibility, indicating enhanced fire-induced erosion and sedimentation. Millennial- and centennial-scale changes are also observed throughout the different proxy records. They exhibit strong correlations with climate records from distant regions, including Greenland and the North Atlantic, providing evidence for global teleconnections among regional climates. A solar-climate connection is suggested by prominent ca. 225 and 390 yr cycles, which may correlate with the 208 yr (Suess) and 400 yr solar cycles.

The catchment of the loch lies mainly on granite and much has recently been afforested. Most of the inflowing streams are acid and the loch itself appears to have acidified over the last two decades. Few acid-sensitive invertebrates occur in the streams or in the loch. The fish populations of the most acid streams are low in density. Growth of arctic charr in the loch resembles that in some other Scottish lochs but appears to have increased in recent years. The charr feed on benthic invertebrates for much of the year but on zooplankton in the summer. Spawning occurs in early October, leaving the fish in poor condition which improves during the spring to reach a maximum in late summer, just prior to spawning. Spawning takes place over gravel and stones in shallow water all round the loch. Angling data indicate that the average size of both trout and arctic charr in Loch Doon has increased significantly over the last 15 years. Chemical and biological evidence suggests that Loch Doon is acidifying and that management is necessary if the stock of charr there is to be saved.

However, relatively few proxy indicators are available to reconstruct the past evolution of the EAWM. Based on the physiology and modern distribution of the temperate forest and boreal forest in Northeast Asia, we found that the northern boundary of temperate pine forest is sensitive to winter temperature and thus it can be used as a proxy for EAWM intensity. A Holocene pollen record from Lake Woniupaozi in Northeast China shows that an expansion of temperate pine forest since -6.0 ka cal BP was linked to a weakening of the EAWM. This pattern is consistent with other paleoclimatic records from Northeast Asia and elsewhere, including the North Atlantic region, Middle East, Arabian Sea, and the Tibetan Plateau/Southwest China, which suggests a major climatic transition in the mid-Holocene. The mechanism responsible for this teleconnection may have been the continuous melting of the Laurentide ice which lowered the SST in the North Atlantic and maintained the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in a positive winter phase. This influence was subsequently transmitted from the North Atlantic region to Eurasia via the winter southern Eurasian (SEA) teleconnection.					; Cui, Qiaoyu/G-7801-2014; Ren, WeiHe/AAQ-4200-2020	MARQUER, LAURENT/0000-0002-5772-3782; Wu, Jing/0000-0003-2513-2475; 													0277-3791	1873-457X				NOV 15	2023	320								108349	10.1016/j.quascirev.2023.108349	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2023.108349		OCT 2023											WOS:001101341400001

We therefore expected changes in foraging pressure to ultimately result in a change in the tuber distribution across sediment depth. A trade-off underlies this idea: deep tubers are less accessible to swans but must be larger to meet the higher energy demands of sprouting in spring. To test this prediction, we compared tuber burial depth over a gradient of foraging pressure both across space and across time. Tuber samples were obtained after aboveground plant senescence but before arrival of Bewick's swans. First, we compared the current tuber bank depth profile in a shallow lake with high foraging pressure, the Lauwersmeer, with that in two wetlands with moderate and low foraging pressure. Second, we compared the Current tuber burial in the Lauwersmeer with that in the early 1980s when exploitation by swans had just started there. In accordance with our hypothesis, we found significantly deeper burial of tubers under high consumption risk compared to low consumption risk, both when comparing sites and comparing time periods. Since tubers in effect only survive to the next spring, the observed differences in burial depth among sites and over time cannot be a direct result of tuber losses due to consumption by swans. Rather, these observations suggest adaptive responses in tuber burial related to foraging pressure from Bewick's swans in the recent past. We thus propose that fennel pondweed exhibits flexible avoidance by escape, of a kind rarely described for plants, where both phenotypic plasticity and genotype sorting may contribute to the observed differences in tuber burial.

J	Li, J; Mackay, AW; Zhang, Y; Li, JJ				Li, Jie; Mackay, Anson W.; Zhang, Yan; Li, Jingjing			A 1000-year record of vegetation change and wildfire from maar lake Erlongwan in northeast China	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												A high-resolution (similar to every 20 y) pollen and charcoal record from Erlongwan maar lake (EML) documents the vegetation history and fire activity of the Long Gang region (northeast China) over the past millennium. The age-depth model is based on Cs-137, Pb-210 measurements, and one calibrated C-14-AMS date at the base of the core. For much of the record, vegetation was dominated by a mixed conifer-hardwood forest. Pollen and charcoal concentrations reveal considerable variability during the past 1000 years. Between 980 and 1500 AD both pollen and charcoal reached maximum concentrations (similar to 1100 AD and 1300 AD respectively). The high pollen concentration was indicative of prevailing moist conditions during the period commonly referred to as the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA). The high concentration of charcoal indicated high frequency and intensity of wildfire during the MCA, probably linked to high biomass productivity and less snow in winter. Between 1500 and 1850 AD both pollen and charcoal concentrations were low, indicative of colder winters with higher snowfall, relative drier summers and less intensive wildfire, coincidence with the cold period commonly known as the Little Ice Age (LIA). During 1900-1950 AD year, the highest relative abundance of Artemisia and the lowest abundance of Pinus together with high concentration of charcoal indicated strong human activity. The pollen data are in broad agreement with a previous study from an adjacent lake, indicating regional rather than localized human impact. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

J	Birks, HH; Bjune, AE				Birks, Hilary H.; Bjune, Anne E.			Can we detect a west Norwegian tree line from modern samples of plant remains and pollen? Results from the DOORMAT project	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY												In the DOORMAT (Direct Observation of Recent Macrofossils Across Treeline) project, the modern representation of local vegetation by pollen and plant remains (plant macrofossils) across a west Norwegian tree line, composed of Betula pubescens and Pinus sylvestris, has been studied over 2 years. The aim was to discover if the modern tree line could be detected and therefore how precisely past tree-line movements could be reconstructed and related to Holocene climate changes by using one proxy or a combination of both. Traps were placed in the vegetation from 663 to 1,120 m a.s.l., spanning the pine altitudinal species limit, the birch tree-line ecotone, and the vegetation zones up to the mid-alpine zone. Three traps were also set in the small lake Trettetjorn close to the modern tree line at 800 m a.s.l. Traps were emptied twice a year to sample both summer and winter seasons. Macrofossils represent their local vegetation well. However, tree Betula remains were trapped above the tree line and Pinus and Picea remains were recorded 1.0-1.5 km away from their sources, demonstrating considerable dispersal capacity. This shows that rare macrofossil remains do not necessarily represent the local presence of these trees. Aerial tree pollen deposition in traps at the upper limit of pine woodland and in the subalpine birch woodland was unexpectedly low, whereas pollen accumulation rates (PAR) were orders of magnitude higher in the lake traps. We hypothesise that the lake receives regional pollen rain washed in from its catchment by snow meltwater and that high values in traps are due to continuous suspension of pollen in the lake water during summer. The interpretation of tree-line changes from existing Holocene pollen and plant macrofossil data from Trettetjorn was supported and refined by the DOORMAT macrofossil data, but the modern pollen data were anomalous.

Bacterial communities of the microbial mats of Chokrak sulfide springs	ARCHIVES OF MICROBIOLOGY												This is the comparative investigation of the composition of phototrophic microbial mats developing in sulfide-rich saline Chokrak springs with outflow at the shore of the hypersaline lake Chokrak by means of next-generation sequencing. The springs are characterized by low temperature (similar to 15 degrees C), near-neutral pH (6.7-8.5), and high-sulfide content. In the species composition the benthic microbial communities of Chokrak springs are similar to microbial mats of marine supralittoral and lagoons. Our results showed that salinity limitation had a significant effect on the species composition of benthic microbial communities developing at the outflow of the Chokrak springs. Predominant oxygenic phototrophs belonged to the genera Phormidium, Lyngbya, Leptolyngbya, Geitlerinema, and Arthrospira. Anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria were represented by halophilic green sulfur bacteria Prosthecochloris spp., halotolerant Chlorobaculum sp., as well as marine and extremely halophilic purple bacteria Roseospira, Rhodovibrio, and Halochromatium.

J	Dorava, JM; Alexander, AM				Dorava, JM; Alexander, AM			Role of lake regulation on glacier-fed rivers in enhancing salmon productivity: the Cook Inlet watershed, south-central Alaska, USA	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Rivers fed by glaciers constitute a major part of the freshwater runoff into the Cook Inlet basin of south-central Alaska. This basin is very important to the economy of the State of Alaska because it is home to more than half of the population and it supports multi-million dollar commercial, subsistence and sport fisheries. Hence an understanding of how glacial runoff influences biological productivity is important for managing rivers that drain into Cook Inlet. This paper examines the ways in which the regulation of glacier-fed rivers by proglacial lakes affects salmon productivity, with particular reference to the Kenai River. Salmon escapement per unit channel length on the Kenai River is between two and ten times that found for rain-and-snowmelt dominated rivers and glacier-fed rivers lacking lake regulation. Lakes are shown to influence biological processes in glacier-fed rivers by attenuating peak flows, sustaining high flows throughout the summer, supplementing winter low flows, settling suspended sediment, and increasing river temperatures. Downstream from large lakes, glacier-fed rivers are less disturbed, channels are relatively stable and have well-developed salmonid habitats. The positive influences are indicated by the high diversity and abundances of benthic macroinvertebrates, which are important food resources for juvenile salmonids. High summer hows allow access for up-river salmon runs and lakes also provide both overwintering and rearing habitat.

Pollen-based quantitative reconstructions of Holocene regional vegetation cover (plant-functional types and land-cover types) in Europe suitable for climate modelling	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												We present quantitative reconstructions of regional vegetation cover in north-western Europe, western Europe north of the Alps, and eastern Europe for five time windows in the Holocene [around 6k, 3k, 0.5k, 0.2k, and 0.05k calendar years before present (bp)] at a 1 degrees x1 degrees spatial scale with the objective of producing vegetation descriptions suitable for climate modelling. The REVEALS model was applied on 636 pollen records from lakes and bogs to reconstruct the past cover of 25 plant taxa grouped into 10 plant-functional types and three land-cover types [evergreen trees, summer-green (deciduous) trees, and open land]. The model corrects for some of the biases in pollen percentages by using pollen productivity estimates and fall speeds of pollen, and by applying simple but robust models of pollen dispersal and deposition. The emerging patterns of tree migration and deforestation between 6k bp and modern time in the REVEALS estimates agree with our general understanding of the vegetation history of Europe based on pollen percentages. However, the degree of anthropogenic deforestation (i.e. cover of cultivated and grazing land) at 3k, 0.5k, and 0.2k bp is significantly higher than deduced from pollen percentages. This is also the case at 6k in some parts of Europe, in particular Britain and Ireland. Furthermore, the relationship between summer-green and evergreen trees, and between individual tree taxa, differs significantly when expressed as pollen percentages or as REVEALS estimates of tree cover. For instance, when Pinus is dominant over Picea as pollen percentages, Picea is dominant over Pinus as REVEALS estimates. These differences play a major role in the reconstruction of European landscapes and for the study of land cover-climate interactions, biodiversity and human resources.

The maximum ciliate biomass and numbers (660 and 990 mug l(-1) of organic carbon, and 290 and 260 cells ml(-1) in NE and SW, respectively) were reached in the surface layer during the ice melting and then continuously decreased. The surface layers were numerically dominated by species of the genus Urotricha, while in the ciliate biomass during the first part of the study, a mixotrophic oligotrich, Pelagostrombidium mirabile prevailed (C-org up to 940 mug l(-1)). We observed a conspicuous ciliate peak that could not be related to the feeding activity of the dominant ciliate species upon picoplankton. Seemingly, the peak was related to the specific conditions resulting from the ice melting where these ciliates could be concentrated. Additionally, the mixotrophy of oligotrichous species allowed them to penetrate below the oxycline, although feeding on nanoplankton such as flagellates was also very likely. Our direct measurements of uptake rates of bacteria showed that the abundant strombidiids were not nutritionally dependent on bacterivory. However, the ciliate uptake rate (up to 670 bacteria ciliate(-1) h(-1)) contributed significantly to the overall bacteria mortality rate. The maximum (community average) cell-specific ciliate feeding rate of over 200 bacteria ciliates(-1) h(-1) was reached, along with an increasing contribution of scuticociliates, paralleled by a drop in large oligotrichs.

However, we still lack a better understanding on both whether multi-season hyper spectral approaches are favorable over single-season approaches, as well as on the benefits of hyperspectral compared to multispectral data. Our study investigates the potential of multi-season unmixing of simulated Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) data for vegetation class fraction mapping across diverse natural and semi-natural ecoregions in California, USA. We utilized spring, summer and fall 2013 simulated EnMAP imagery derived from Airborne Visible / Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data covering study sites in the San Francisco Bay Area, Lake Tahoe and Santa Barbara. Regression-based unmixing with synthetic training datasets from spectral libraries was implemented for mapping needleleaf tree, broadleaf tree, shrub, herbaceous and non-vegetation fractions, and independent reference data was used for validation. Multi-season unmixing of simulated EnMAP had average Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) over all classes of 8.7% for the Bay Area, 8.5% for Lake Tahoe and 9.6% for Santa Barbara. However, larger errors in the low and high end of the fraction range remained, particularly in open-canopy woodlands and xeric shrub-dominated regions. Single season unmixing of simulated EnMAP revealed large seasonal and regional variations within individual vegetation classes. In most cases, the best performing single-season unmixing had similar errors as the multi-season unmixing, i.e., increment MAEs within +/- 1.0%. This points to the advantage of the multi-season integration strategy for more robust and generalized mapping independent from season and study site. Relative to EnMAP analyses, multi-season unmixing of multispectral Landsat composites for the same seasons yielded increases in average MAEs of +1.7%, +2.3% and +1.4% for the three study sites. This indicates that the higher spectral resolution of simulated EnMAP provides more relevant discriminative information when comparing contemporary image pairs. Unmixing of seasonal spectral-temporal metrics (STMs) from all available Landsat images for an entire year took advantage of the full temporal detail provided by these ongoing missions. We found Landsat STMs to effectively map vegetation class fractions, with average MAEs of 9.9%, 10.0% and 9.7% for the three study sites. Still, improvements particularly for mapping fractions of the woody vegetation classes through multi-season unmixing of simulated EnMAP point to the benefit of high spectral resolution data, and we assume that a comparable higher temporal resolution of hyperspectral satellites will further positively influence results. Overall, we conclude that multi-season unmixing of spaceborne imaging spectroscopy data holds great potential for advancing vegetation class fraction mapping across natural and semi-natural ecosystems.					; van der Linden, Sebastian/B-4516-2008; Okujeni, Akpona/AAT-3000-2021; Hostert, Patrick/F-9291-2013	Okujeni, Akpona/0000-0003-4558-5885; van der Linden, Sebastian/0000-0001-6576-8377; Janicke, Clemens/0000-0003-3393-5665; 													0034-4257	1879-0704				OCT	2021	264								112558	10.1016/j.rse.2021.112558	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2021.112558		AUG 2021											WOS:000688451300005

However, the pattern and rate of Holocene temperature variations still remain enigmatic due to lack of land-based proxy reconstructions with an unambiguous climatic significance. Here we present a well-dated, high-resolution, quantitative temperature record based on brGDGT proxy during the past 8000 years from the Chenghai Lake in southwestern China. A systematic modern investigation reveals a close correlation between the reconstructed and instrumental mean annual air temperature (MAAT) during the past 60 years, suggesting that sedimentary brGDGT proxy can capture the variations of MAAT during the geological past with a high fidelity. Within an improved chronological framework, our reconstructed Holocene MAAT record displays a long-term warming trend with a magnitude of similar to 1.5 degrees C. This overall warming pattern is consistent with the variations of existing regional MAAT records, but in contradiction to the summer temperature records which is similar to the variation of the Asian summer monsoon. In light of state-of-the-art transient climate simulations, we demonstrate that changes in Holocene MAAT were forced by local annual-mean insolation with an additional radiative forcing of greenhouse gases, while changes in summer temperature were mainly controlled by local summer insolation, thereby resulting in a divergent pattern of seasonal temperature changes in southwestern China. Our study provides new evidence for reconciling the "Holocene temperature conundrum" between proxy reconstruction and model simulations from low latitudes.

Here, seasonal variations of cyanobacteria and their relationships with environmental factors were investigated for Lake Guchenghu area. Results suggested the changes of cyanobacteria community in crab ponds distinguished from the adjacent lake. In the lake, cyanobacterial biomass (3.86 mg/L, 34.6% of the total phytoplankton) was the highest in autumn with the dominance of Oscillatoria, Aphanocapsa and Pesudanabaena. By contrast, in crab ponds, cyanobacteria (46.80 mg/L, 97.2% of the total phytoplankton biomass) were the most abundant in summer when Pesudanabaena and Raphidiopsis were the dominant species. Of particular note was that obviously higher abundance of filamentous and potentially harmful species (e.g., Raphidiopsis raciborskii and Dolichospermum circinale) were observed in ponds compared to the lake. Specifically, water depth (WD), permanganate index (CODMn), total phosphorus (TP), N:P ratio, and NO2(-)-N were the key environmental variables affected cyanobacteria composition. For crab ponds, N:P ratio, water temperature (WT) and TP were the potential environmental drivers of cyanobacteria development. This study highlighted the fact that mitten crab culture had non-negligible influences on the cyanobacteria community and additional attention should be paid to the cyanobacteria dynamics in mitten crab culture-impacted water bodies, especially for those potentially harmful species.					; Chen, Huihui/L-8521-2019	Mao, Zhigang/0000-0003-4353-622X; 														2073-4441				DEC	2019	11	12							2468	10.3390/w11122468	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11122468													WOS:000507378600041
J	Evans, PM; Walton, S; Riffkin, PA; Kearney, GA				Evans, PM; Walton, S; Riffkin, PA; Kearney, GA			Effect of plant density on the winter production of annual clovers grown in monocultures	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												The small-seeded annual clovers, balansa and Persian, are often assumed to be poor winter producers. Their small seed size, of about 1 mg or less, and poor regeneration, possibly due to inappropriate grazing management in many instances, contributes to this perception. To test the hypothesis that early growth of these clovers is determined by the weight of germinating seed, as it is in subterranean clover, an experiment with 2 cultivars of subterranean clover, Leura and Trikkala, 2 cultivars of balansa clover, Paradana and Bolta, and 1 of Persian clover, Nitro Plus, was established in the field at Hamilton, western Victoria, at 6 sowing densities. The winter production at 2 additional sites, Lake Bolac and Streatham, in their third and second and third seasons, respectively, was also examined. Plant density varied from 30 to 37000 plants/m(2) across sites and species. With equal weight of germinating seed per unit area at sowing, balansa and Persian clovers produced more herbage in winter than did the 2 subterranean clover cultivars Leura and Trikkala (P<0.05). Even though there was high correlation between seed weight and seedling weight across all species shortly after emergence (r(2) = 0.99), by harvest time no differences in plant weight existed between any treatments growing at the same plant density. From this we conclude the following: (i) for the same weight of germinable seed per unit area, balansa and Persian clovers produced more dry weight per hectare than subterranean clover, because they had higher plant densities; (ii) there were no differences in dry matter production per hectare between species growing at similar plant densities by harvest time at the end of winter; (iii) it appeared that in winter the small-seeded species exhibited a higher relative growth rate than the 2 subterranean clovers.																			0816-1089						2002	42	2					135	141	UNSP 0816-1089/02/020135	10.1071/EA01003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EA01003													WOS:000174330700005

Telemetry-Determined Habitat Use Informs Multi-Species Habitat Management in an Urban Harbour	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Widespread human development has led to impairment of freshwater coastal wetlands and embayments, which provide critical and unique habitat for many freshwater fish species. This is particularly evident in the Laurentian Great Lakes, where such habitats have been severely altered over the last century as a result of industrial activities, urbanization, dredging and infilling. In Toronto Harbour, extensive restoration efforts have been directed towards improving the amount and quality of aquatic habitat, especially for fishes. To evaluate the effectiveness of this restoration work, use of the restored area by both target species and the fish community as a whole must be assessed. Individuals from four species (Common Carp, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch) were tagged and tracked continuously for 1 year using an acoustic telemetry array in Toronto Harbour area of Lake Ontario. Daily site fidelity was estimated using a mixed-effects logistic regression model. Daily site fidelity was influenced by habitat restoration and its interactions with species and body size, as well as season and its interactions with species and body size. Daily site fidelity was higher in restored sites compared to non-restored sites for Yellow Perch and Northern Pike, but lower for Largemouth Bass and Common Carp. For all species, daily site fidelity estimates were highest during the summer and lowest during autumn. The approach used here has merit for evaluating restoration success and informing future habitat management activities. Creating diverse habitats that serve multiple functions and species are more desirable than single-function-oriented or single-species-oriented designs.

J	Caen, A; Mathias, JD; Latour, D				Caen, Auguste; Mathias, Jean-Denis; Latour, Delphine			How do seasonal temperature variations influence interplay between toxic and non-toxic cyanobacterial blooms? Evidence from modeling and experimental data	HARMFUL ALGAE												Summer cyanobacterial blooms exhibit a dynamic interplay between toxic and non-toxic genotypes, significantly influencing the cyanotoxin levels within a lake. The challenge lies in accurately predicting these toxin concentrations due to the significant temporal fluctuations in the proportions of toxic and non-toxic genotypes. Typically, the toxic genotypes dominate during the early and late summer periods, while the non-toxic variants prevail in mid-summer. To dissect this phenomenon, we propose a model that accounts for the competitive interaction between toxic and non-toxic genotypes, as well as seasonal temperature variations. Our numerical simulations suggest that the optimal temperature of the toxic genotypes is lower than that of the optimal temperatures of the non-toxic counterparts. This difference of optimal temperature may potentially contribute to explain the dominance of toxic genotypes at the early and late summer periods, situation often observed in the field. Experimental data from the laboratory align qualitatively with our simulation results, enabling a better understanding of complex interplays between toxic and non-toxic cyanobacteria.

In this study, nine BPs were analyzed in raw and finished water samples collected from 9 drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) in the Taihu Lake Basin in August 2019 and December 2019. The removal efficiencies of BPs by treatment processes in DWTPs were investigated, and the estrogenic activity and human exposure risk of BPs were evaluated. The main results are as follows: nine BPs in the raw water were detected, with detection frequencies ranging from 89% to 100%. BPA was the main bisphenol substance in the raw water in summer and winter, with mean concentrations of 19.7 ng L-1 and 6.44 ng L-1, respectively. The conventional treatment processes in DWTPs had a considerable removal efficiency of BPs with average removal efficiencies for individual bisphenol ranging from 26.7% to 80.2%. There was no significant seasonal difference in the average removal efficiency of BPs, except that the removal effect of BPF became better in winter. The best single removal process was carbon filtration, followed by pre-ozonation, with average removal efficiencies of 28.3% and 14.6%, respectively. In general, a combination of physical adsorption and biological oxidation had the best removal effect, while single chemical oxidation was also effective for the removal of BPs. The health risk evaluation of drinking water showed that the mean 17 beta-estradiol equivalent quantity (EEQ(t)) of n-ary sumation BPs in the effluent was 2.61 x 10(-2) ng E-2 L-1, indicating no interference with the human endocrine system. Adult males had a higher EDI than adult females, while boys had a lower EDI than girls of all ages. By using the RfD value of BPA as a reference it can be concluded that BPs did not pose a greater health risk through drinking water.																			2053-1400	2053-1419				MAR 2	2023	9	3					806	817		10.1039/d2ew00797e	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ew00797e		DEC 2022											WOS:000913031500001

Scribn. and Ammophila breviligulata Fern. in a blowout along Lake Huron shoreline. Seeds were planted in June or October 1982 and covered with various mulches (sodium silicate, asphalt emulsion, wood chips, peat moss, straw, jute mesh, hydro mulch plus erosion blanket and control). Two other treatments (fertilizer and weekly watering) were also tested. Planting of grass seeds on October was more appropriate than the June planting because the seeds did not have to be artificially stratified and watering was not essential for seed germination and seedling emergence in spring. In 1982, about 2 to 26% of Ammophila breviligulata seedlings established in different treatments probably owing to shading by the sides of wooden frames and well distributed precipitation during summer. However, in summer 1983 with normal precipitation and natural dune environment, none of the seedlings survived in any of the treatments. It is suggested that A. breviligulata should not be planted from seed. In contrast, the seedling establishment of C. longifolia was rather high (7 to 96%) in different treatments in all three years. After 63 or 67 weeks of sowing, none of the mulch treatments were significantly better than control except jute mesh and erosion blanket for C. longifolia. The application of fertilizer resulted in larger seedlings than control at the end of one year.																			0749-0208	1551-5036				FAL	1989	5	4					791	800																WOS:A1989AV96000013

Do changes in berry crops drive population fluctuations in small rodents in the southwestern Yukon?

J	Rikardsen, AH; Elliott, JM				Rikardsen, AH; Elliott, JM			Variations in juvenile growth, energy allocation and life-history strategies of two populations of Arctic charr in North Norway	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Within the populations of Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus in Stonratn and Rungavatn, Norway, fish that attained the largest size in the fate parr stage migrated as 4 + smolts, fish that attained a medium size became 5 + smolts. and the smallest parr became lake residents. Within the last 2 years of the parr stage, those that became anadromous had a lower growth rate during the winter and early summer than those that became resident, and vice versa in late summer. Thus, anadromous fish grew faster in the parr stage, but in years prior to migration, their growth pattern seemed to differ from that of parr that became resident. Due to early size differences between parr that became anadromous or resident, it is suggested that some of the basis for the decision to smoltify or not in charr depends on the growth rats through the whole parr stage, but with significant modification by the local environment. Rungavatn parr had a significantly higher population density (5 x), higher lipid content and mortality, an earlier maturation, a lower rate of growth, and only one-third the degree of anadromy than those from Storvatn. II is suggested that the two charr populations have evolved different life-history adaptations due to unequal growth, energy allocation and competition opportunities in the lakes.

Rainbow trout (N = 134) longer than 440 mm were implanted with radio transmitters and tracked for varying periods from July 1997 to April 1999. Fifty-eight radio-tagged fish were tracked for sufficient duration (at least 11 months) to allow description of seasonal migratory patterns. Unique seasonal movements of fish suggested discrete, within-basin population structure. Telemetry data documented the existence of multiple migratory and nonmigratory groups of rainbow trout, indicating unique life history patterns. The observed groups consisted of what we defined as a lake-resident ecotype, a lake-river ecotype, and a riverine ecotype; the riverive ecotype demonstrated both highly migratory and nonmigratory movement behavior. Considerable variation in movement patterns was found within both the lake-river group and the river migratory group. Radio-tagged trout did not migrate between the two Alagnak watershed lakes in either year of the study, suggesting lake fidelity in the population structure. Alagnak River rainbow trout may have evolved the observed seasonal movement patterns to optimize winter thermal refugia and summer food availability of salmon eggs and carcasses.

J	Carney, HJ; Havens, KE; Bersier, LF				Carney, HJ; Havens, KE; Bersier, LF			Nonlinear scale dependence and spatiotemporal variability in planktonic food webs	OIKOS												Zooplankton food webs of Lake Okeechobee, Florida, were analyzed in order to examine spatiotemporal variability and test for scale dependence of major food web properties. 46 webs were constructed from data collected during several years (1988-92) at six locations. For all these webs, the following food web properties were calculated: number of species, total links, links per species, connectance, percentage of top and intermediate species, and food chain length. We did not find any statistically significant spatiotemporal variation in these properties. Still, there were consistent differences seasonally (summer vs winter) and spatially (littoral vs pelagic habitats). There was also a very clear nonlinear scale dependence in most food web properties: links per species, food chain length, and proportions of top and intermediate species vs number of species. The scale dependence was strong for small webs, but became weaker for larger webs. The relatively simple food webs and consistently collected data used in our study provide some of the dearest and most statistically significant results to date. They help reconcile the debate about scale invariance vs dependence in major food web properties.

J	Lu, YB; An, CB; Zhao, JJ				Lu, Yanbin; An, ChengBang; Zhao, Jiaju			An isotopic study on water system of Lake Barkol and its implication for Holocene climate dynamics in arid central Asia	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Mechanism of arid central Asia climate dynamics is still an open question even it has been studied for a long time. Interpreting climatic proxy data properly is crucial for better understanding the paleoclimate in such a sensitive area and its role in the earth system. According to the analysis of water stable isotope (delta O-18 and delta D), Lake Barkol catchment obeys the typical isotopic model of a hydrologically closed lake: Lake input water inherits the feature of the weighted mean annual isotopes in precipitation, and lake water isotopes move along the local evaporation line from the start point of input water isotopes, modulated by the regional effective moisture. Based on the modern water isotopes and its relation to the climate, sediment carbonate oxygen isotope (delta O-18 carb) record reinterpretation suggests that the Asian monsoon incursion to arid central Asia area alone is unlikely the reason for the early Holocene delta O-18 carb negative, as the calculated extreme summer rainfall delta O-18 change to compensate the more negative delta O-18 carb in the early Holocene is far beyond our knowledge of precipitation isotopes in the real world. Besides, a 40 % of winter precipitation increase could explain the delta O-18 negative change in the early Holocene, which does, more importantly, reconcile the contradiction between the pollen Aretemisia/Chenopodiaceae effective moisture and delta O-18 records.					; jiaju, zhao/ABZ-9580-2022	An, Cheng-Bang/0000-0002-4443-0518; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				FEB	2015	73	3					1377	1383		10.1007/s12665-014-3492-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-014-3492-2													WOS:000348340900037

Here, we show that the aquatic ecosystems in historically arid West Greenland have undergone an ecological transformation after a series of atmospheric rivers that simultaneously produced record heat and rainfall hit the region in autumn 2022. We analyzed a unique, long- term lake dataset and found that compound climate extremes pushed Arctic lakes across a tipping point. As terrestrial-aquatic linkages were strengthened, lakes synchronously transformed from "blue" lakes with high transparency and low pelagic primary production to "brown" in less than a year, owing to a large influx of dissolved organic material and metals, with iron concentrations increasing by more than two orders of magnitude. The browning of lake waters reduced light penetration by 50% across lakes. The resulting light limitation altered plankton distributions and community structure, including a major reduction in prokaryotic diversity and an increase in algal groups capable of metabolizing organic carbon sources. As a result, lakes shifted from being summer carbon sinks to sources, with a >350% increase in carbon dioxide flux from lakes to the atmosphere. The remarkably rapid, coherent transformation of these Arctic ecosystems underscores the synergistic and unpredictable impacts of compound extreme events and the importance of their seasonal timing, especially in regions with negative moisture balance.					; Jiang, binbin/KLZ-1414-2024; Birkel, Sean/W-2504-2019; Pereira, Ryan/AAB-6331-2019; Huston, Grayson/JJC-6220-2023	Northington, Robert/0000-0002-1347-0971; Huston, Grayson/0009-0009-4863-4284; Birkel, Sean/0000-0003-0287-5604; Lamb, Avery/0009-0000-6889-0255; Pereira, Ryan/0000-0001-6492-7874; Bourdin, Guillaume/0000-0001-7608-5256; Hazukova, Vaclava/0000-0003-2073-221X; 													0027-8424	1091-6490				JAN 28	2025	122	4							e2413855122	10.1073/pnas.2413855122	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2413855122								39835905					WOS:001417241700003

Carbon emission from the Lower Ob River floodplain during spring flood	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Carbon emission from Arctic rivers constitutes a positive feedback between the climate warming and C cycle. However, in case of rivers with extensive floodplains, the impacts of temporary water bodies and secondary channels on CO2 exchange with atmosphere, compared to the main stem and tributaries, remain strongly understudied. In order to quantify the relative role of various water bodies of the Arctic river basin in the C cycle, the hydrochemical variables and greenhouse gases GHG concentrations and fluxes were measured within the floodplain of the largest Arctic River, Ob, in its low reaches located in the permafrost zone. These included the main stem, secondary channels, tributaries and floodplain lakes sampled over a 900 km north-south transect (25,736 km(2) of the main stem and adjacent floodplain area; 7893 km(2) water surface) during peak of spring flood (May 2023). In addition to main stem and tributaries, providing less than a half of overall C flux, floodplain lakes and secondary channels acted as important factor of C emission from the floodplain water surfaces. Multi-parametric statistical treatment of the data suggested two main processes of C emission from the Ob River floodplain waters: terrestrial organic matter-rich flooded wetlands (fens) provided elevated pCO(2), whereas the sites of possible groundwater discharge in the secondary channels decreased the CO2 fluxes due to more alkaline environments, rich in labile metals and anionic elements. Based on available high-resolution Landsat-8 images, which matched the period of field work, it was found that the total water coverage of the floodplain during spring 2023 was 30 % of overall territory, compared to 18 % during the baseflow. Based on chamber-measured CO2 fluxes (1.56 +/- 0.47 g C-CO2 m(-2) d(-1)), overall CO2 emissions during 2 months of the spring flood from the entire Lower Ob River floodplain water surfaces including the main stem amounted to 0.73 +/- 0.25 Tg C. Diffuse CH4 flux represented <1 % of total C flux. The main stem of the Ob River accounted for 34 % and 18 % of CO2 and CH4 emissions, respectively, whereas the floodplain lakes provided 59 % and 50 % of CO2 and CH4 emission, respectively. Considering that the low reaches of the Ob River represent >70 % of total river basin floodplain, and that during some years, the entire floodplain can be covered by water, emissions from the river - if assessed solely from summer (July-August) measurements - can be at least 3 times underestimated. It is therefore important to account for extended water surface during high water levels on Arctic rivers when assessing global riverine C emissions.

Environmental effects on activity rhythms of fish in the Arctic	BIOLOGY LETTERS												Polar regions are characterized by acute seasonal changes in the environment, with organisms inhabiting these regions lacking diel photoperiodic information for parts of the year. We present, to our knowledge, the first high-resolution analysis of diel and seasonal activity of free-living fishes in polar waters (748N), subject to extreme variation in photoperiod, temperature and food availability. Using biotelemetry, we tracked two sympatric ecomorphs of lake-dwelling Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus n = 23) over an annual cycle. Charr activity rhythms reflected the above-surface photoperiod (including under ice), with diel rhythms of activity observed. During the dark winter solstice period, charr activity became arrhythmic and much reduced, even though estimated light levels were within those at which charr can feed. When twilight resumed, charr activity ensued as diel vertical migration, which continued throughout spring and with increasing day length, despite stable water temperatures. Diel activity rhythms ceased during the polar day, with a sharp increase in arrhythmic fish activity occurring at ice-break. Despite contrasting resource use, circannual rhythms were mirrored in the two ecomorphs, although individual variability in activity rhythms was evident. Our data support conclusions of functionally adaptive periods of arrhythmicity in polar animals, suggesting maintenance of a circannual oscillator for scheduling seasonal behavioural and developmental processes.					, Guttorm/KCK-8343-2024; Rosten, Carolyn/U-4242-2017	Haugen, Thrond Oddvar/0000-0001-6562-5317; Rosten, Carolyn/0000-0002-1117-444X; Lucas, Martyn C/0000-0002-2009-1785													1744-9561	1744-957X				DEC 1	2017	13	12							20170575	10.1098/rsbl.2017.0575	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2017.0575								29212752					WOS:000418695400007

BC concentration at DSL was 1.39 +/- 1.15 mu g m(-3), which was at low to medium level compared to other areas in the world, and annual BC level was decreased by an average of 45.4% from 2014 to 2018. The absorption Angstrom exponent (AAE) value was 1.30 +/- 0.173, indicating the predominant contribution of liquid fuel sources such as traffic exhaust to BC. Meanwhile, AAE and BC values both showed the winter-high and summer-low temporal patterns, which highlighted the increasing contribution from solid fuels to BC in winter. Moreover, diurnal characteristics of BC, AAE, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide demonstrated the dominance of traffic sources for BC. The average estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of BC through inhalation for 17 population age subgroups were 0.0177-0.0811 mu g kg(-1) day(-1), which the highest EDIs for male and female were both observed in infants (9 months similar to < 1 year). Male generally taken higher exposure level of BC compared to female. This work could improve the insights for atmospheric characteristic and population exposure level of BC, and potentially facilitate the development of abatement policies of BC in YRD region, China.

The efficiencies of both nonpredatory and predatory zooplankton are high. The production of phytoplankton is expended mostly for sedimentation in April, for grazing by zooplankton in June, heterotrophic respiration and accumulation of dissolved and particulate organic matter in Aug.-Sept. and sedimentation in late autumn. Almost total elimination of zooplankton by predators, mostly invertebrates, was found. About 10% of autochthonically producted plus allochthonic matter is annually removed from cycling, mostly as permanent bottom deposits. The annual load of P is 3 times higher than the permissible Vollen-Weider''s level. About 70% of P load, but only 2% of its reserve in the lake, is annually removed from cycling. Progressing eutrophication resulted in several times increased phytoplankton biomass, decrease of phytoplankton P/B [production/biomass] and share of nannoplankton, increase of decomposition in epilimnion, etc., during 10 yr. In spite of this, the pelagic community in spring still has a mesotrophic rather than highly eutrophic character. Increased eutrophication due to human impact (deforestation, agriculture, erosion) is also seen in bottom deposits since the 15th century.																			0020-9309						1978	63	4					451	480		10.1002/iroh.19780630402	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19780630402													WOS:A1978GJ62700001

Effects of an Oil Spill on the Regrowth of Emergent Vegetation in a Northern Alberta Lake	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Following a train derailment in August 2005, Wabamun Lake (Alberta, Canada) was exposed to similar to 149,500 L of bunker "C" oil, much of which became entrained in the abundant Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani (= Scirpus validus) beds in the eastern basin of the lake. We assessed the regrowth of emergent macrophytes during the subsequent two growing seasons. Postspill measures of productivity, including transect length, total cover, and biomass were within the variability of prespill data collected in 2001, with the exception of a few specific areas in which biomass appeared to be affected. We conclude that exposure to oil during the late growing season in August 2005 and through the winter senescent period and regrowth in the summers of 2006 and 2007 did not cause large-scale changes to S. tabernaemontani communities. Physical factors such as cleanup activities and vegetation management appeared to be responsible for the reduced regrowth observed at some locations. Few previous studies have been published on the effects of oil spilled into freshwater on macrophyte communities; thus, the results of this study are expected to provide useful information for the assessment of future freshwater oil spills.

The surface zone occupied by the "carpet" of Lemna trisulca and L. minor was characterized by a large daily amplitude of oxygen content with periodic exceeding of 100% of saturation; the underlying water layer was characterized by microaerobic conditions throughout most of the year, with seasonal deviations towards oxygen-free conditions (in winter and mid-summer) or increased oxygen content (before freezing and after ice melt); stable oxygen-free conditions were maintained in the bottom layer of water and at the bottom of the lake. There were 111 species of ciliated protozoa recorded in the lake. The ciliated protozoa were clearly structured and formed three almost non-overlapping assemblages in terms of species composition, which retained their isolation during all seasons of the year. On the basis of the analysis performed using the R indicspecies package, species of ciliated protozoa were identified as indicators of conditions with different oxygen regimes, which are determined by the level of organic pollution and the distribution of photosynthetic organisms.

J	Özbay, H				Ozbay, Hanife			Bacterial community on submersed plants in running water	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												The Ceyhan River basin consists of a large number of rivers, lakes and dams and since the basin area is important for agricultural and industrial activities, it receives an extensive discharge of pollutants. There is a possibility that toxic (e.g. some cyanobacteria) and pathogenic, such as Salmonella species, bacteria present in the bacterial community. Therefore these bacteria could be responsible for water quality and the health diseases of the aquatic organisms. In this study the epiphytic bacterial densities on different submersed species, collected from Ceyhan River Basin, in different seasons have been compared. The impacts of physico-chemical variables of the surrounding water on epiphytic bacteria population has also been tested. Average densities of bacteria on the leaves of all tested plants were higher in autumn and lower in spring. In all seasons, the density of bacteria on the leaves of Myriophyllum spicatum was higher than that of the other two species, Ceratophyllum demersum and Groenlandia densa. Bacterial density on the leaves of all tested plants significantly differed between the season. Epiphytic bacterial density correlated significantly with pH, conductivity and NO3-. On the other hand, epiphytic bacterial density was strongly correlated with temperature, TN, NH4+, TP, SRP and Chl a, while no significant correlation could be determined between bacterial population and DO.																			1944-3994	1944-3986				FEB	2018	106						267	272		10.5004/dwt.2018.22078	http://dx.doi.org/10.5004/dwt.2018.22078													WOS:000445116000027

Concentration of dissolved reactive Si decreased markedly during the spring and summer growth period of diatoms in 1979 and 1980. Amounts of Si taken up per cell and per unit cell volume were calculated from the changes in Si concentration and the increases in population density for several diatom species. The Si to cell quotient (mg/million cells) varied over a wide range from 0.005 for Stephanodiscus hantzschii to 0.72 for Synedra acus, while that of Si per unit cell volume (mg mm-3) varied over a narrow range from 0.10 for S. hantzschii and Fragilaria crotonensis to 0.36 for S. acus. A 4-compartment model, that allows estimates of the rates of growth and of loss of diatom populations to be calculated, is outlined. Summer succession from Asterionella formosa to either F. crotonensis (in 1979) or Stephanodiscus binderanus (in 1980) is explained by interspecific differences in the effects of Si concentration on growth and death. For Asterionella formosa, Si depletion did not stop cell-division but led to the death of most of the population. For F. crotonensis and S. binderanus, cell division stopped but cells did not die and population growth continued after the concentration of dissolved Si had increased again.

The Eurasian Spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia leucorodia) is a national grade II protected wildlife species in China. Few studies on the distribution and protection of Eurasian Spoonbill have been carried out in wintering grounds. We simulated the potential distribution of the Eurasian Spoonbill and analyzed the impact of climate change on this species, with occurrence sites recorded during the National Waterbird Simultaneous Survey of China in 2016 to support species conservation. We also analyzed the main environmental factors affecting its overwintering distribution. We conclude that the majority of suitable wintering habitats are concentrated in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and tend to shift northward under future emission scenarios. Moreover, the main factors affecting the suitable wintering habitat areas at present are water distance, altitude, precipitation, and mean temperature of the driest quarter. Therefore, future conservation work should pay considerable attention to the suitable habitat of the white spoonbill in the middle and high levels to effectively conserve this species over time. These findings offer a valuable reference for the conservation of the Eurasian Spoonbill and other endangered species under climate change. Furthermore, it provides a reference for wetland development, utilization, and protection. Global climate change has become a trend and is one of the main factors affecting biodiversity patterns and species distributions. Many wild animals adapt to the changing living environment caused by climate change by changing their habitats. Birds are highly sensitive to climate change. Understanding the suitable wintering habitat of the Eurasian Spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia leucorodia) and its response to future climatic change is essential for its protection. In China, it was listed as national grade II key protected wild animal in the adjusted State List of key protected wild animals in 2021, in Near Threatened status. Few studies on the distribution of the wintering Eurasian Spoonbill have been carried out in China. In this study, we simulated the suitable habitat under the current period and modeled the distribution dynamics of the wintering Eurasian Spoonbill in response to climate change under different periods by using the MaxEnt model. Our results showed that the current suitable wintering habitats for the Eurasian Spoonbill are mainly concentrated in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Distance from the water, precipitation of the driest quarter, altitude, and mean temperature of the driest quarter contributed the most to the distribution model for the wintering Eurasian Spoonbill, with a cumulative contribution of 85%.

The factors affecting the molybdate reactive P (MRP) in these waters were analyzed using the data of the past decade (>200 000 observations). The average MRP concentration in summer exceeds that winter by factor 3. This seasonal trend is opposite to that of the dissolved oxygen (DO) and nitrate concentrations. The negative correlations between MRP and DO is marked (r = -0.89). The MRP concentrations are geographically unrelated to erosion sensitive areas, to point source P-emissions or to riverbed sediment P concentration. Instead, MRP concentrations significantly increase with increasing sediment P/Fe concentration ratio (p < 0.01). Laboratory static sediment water incubations with different DO and temperature treatments confirmed suspected mechanisms: at low DO in water (<4 mg L-1), reductive dissolution of ferric Fe oxides was associated with mobilization of P to the water column from sediments with a molar P/Fe ratio >0.4. In contrast, no such release was found from sediments with lower P/Fe irrespective of temperature and DO treatments. This study suggests that internal loading of the legacy P in the sediments explains the MRP concentrations which are most pronounced at low DO concentrations and in regions where the P/Fe ratio in sediment is large.

Recent studies have shown that long-distance migratory birds, besides accumulating fat for use as fuel, also show adaptive phenotypic flexibility in several organs during migration. The migratory routes of many songbirds include stretches of sea and desert where fuelling is not possible. Large fuel loads increase flight costs and predation risk, therefore extensive fuelling should occur only immediately prior to crossing inhospitable zones. However, despite their crucial importance for the survival of migratory birds, both strategic refuelling decisions and variation in phenotypic flexibility during migration are not well understood. First-year thrush nightingales (Luscinia luscinia) caught in the early phase of the onset of autumn migration in southeast Sweden and exposed to a magnetic treatment simulating a migratory flight to northern Egypt increased more in fuel load than control birds. By contrast, birds trapped during the late phase of the onset of autumn migration accumulated a high fuel load irrespective of magnetic treatment. Furthermore, early birds increased less in flight-muscle size than birds trapped later in autumn. We suggest that the relative importance of endogenous and environmental factors in individual birds is affected by the time of season and by geographical area. When approaching a barrier, environmental cues may act irrespective of the endogenous time programme.

J	An, ZS				An, ZS			The history and variability of the East Asian paleomonsoon climate	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS					1st PAGES Open Science Meeting	APR 19-23, 1998	UNIV LONDON, LONDON, ENGLAND		UNIV LONDON			Changes in the East Asian paleomonsoon reflect interactions between the global atmosphere, ocean, land and ice systems, and are also an expression of their combined effect within the boundary conditions imposed by the East Asian continent and solar radiation. The history of the East Asian monsoon is an alternation between dominance by the dry-cold winter and warm-humid summer monsoons. High-resolution eolian sequences preserved in the Chinese Loess Plateau reveal that the East Asian monsoon may have commenced at least 7.2 Ma ago. They also provide evidence indicating that the pulsed uplift of the Tibetan Plateau at about 3.4 and 7.2 Ma may have played an important role in inducing climate change. The palaeoclimatic records of the last glacial cycle show high-frequency variability on time scales of 1000-year or even shorter, and instability of the East Asian paleomonsoon system. The high-frequency variability could be due to a non-linear response to orbital forcing, or a result of the coupling processes between different components of the global system. Cold air activity in northern high latitudes, the trans-equatorial air streams from the Southern Hemisphere and, possibly, ENSO may have played an important role in East Asian monsoon variability. The synchroneity of all the palaeoclimatic events along the polar-equator-polar (PEP) transect is still an open question. Correlation of limited palaeoclimatic records for the last 30 kyr obtained from East Asia and Australia suggests that the trans-equatorial air streams driven by the monsoon and trade winds may have had an influence on opposite hemispheres.

J	Meadows, ME; Baxter, AJ				Meadows, ME; Baxter, AJ			Holocene vegetation history and palaeoenvironments at Klaarfontein Springs, Western Cape, South Africa	HOLOCENE												Several sediment cores around the coastal lake of Verlorenvlei, Western Cape, have thus far revealed important details of the development of this semi-arid winter-rainfall environment during the late Quaternary. Complex interplay between climate change, sea-level fluctuation and human activities have characterized the Verlorenvlei record and suggests that these environments have been subject to high degrees of disturbance over time. However, due to the discontinuous nature of the sedimentary record, the Holocene record has remained fragmentary. Investigation of a 6 m vibracore sequence at Klaarfontein (32 degrees 25'26"S; 18 degrees 29'40"E), an artesian spring site some 18 km inland of Eland's Bay, facilitates a more complete Holocene palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. Pollen concentrations in 37 spectra distributed through the 6 m core vary with organic content, but at all depths are sufficient to facilitate interpretation of vegetation history and reveal a high degree of dynamism in the local and regional environments. The lower sediments are characterized by elements strongly indicative of more xeric conditions and the catchment appears to have been dominated by drought-resisting woody shrubs. Local vegetation in the mid-Holocene is consistent with the occurrence of two sealevel transgressions resulting in each case in the development of a salt marsh at the site. The uppermost pollen spectra are all relatively modern (post 200 BP). Grass pollen declines from 1900 BP, possibly as a result of the occupation of the area by pastoralists, although climate change cannot be ruled out. A decline in pollen diversity towards the surface is associated with a further reduction in grass pollen and an increase in the proportion of succulents, hence offering support for the hypothesis of significant colonial and post-colonial disturbance of the vegetation. The evaluation of the. pollen sequence at Klaarfontein supports previous palaeoenvironmental reconstructions and at once reveals new insights regarding the complex Holocene limnology, hydrology and geomorphology of the Verlorenvlei system.

However, little distinction has been made between short- and long-distance migrants and between local and flight birds (passage migrants) in describing migration chronology. In addition, measures of food abundance as a proximate factor influencing timing of migration are lacking in studies of migration chronology. To address the relationship between environmental variables and timing of migration, we quantified the relative importance of proximate external factors on migration chronology of local American woodcock (Scolopax minor), a short distance migrant, using event-time analysis methods (survival analysis). We captured 1,094 woodcock local to our study sites in Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin (USA) during autumn 2002-2004 and documented 786 departure dates for these birds. Photoperiod appeared to provide an initial proximate cue for timing of departure. Moon phase was important in modifying timing of departure, which may serve as a navigational aid in piloting and possibly orientation. Local synoptic weather variables also contributed to timing of departure by changing the rate of departure from our study sites. We found no evidence that food availability influenced timing of woodcock departure. Our results suggest that woodcock use a conservative photoperiod-controlled strategy with proximate modifiers for timing of migration rather than relying on abundance of their primary food, earthworms. Managing harvest pressure on local birds by adjusting season lengths may be an effective management tool with consistent migration patterns from year to year based on photoperiod.

Pikeperch stocking has also been part of the manipulation strategy in Feldberger Haussee, Germany. From 1996 to 1999, population development, growth and diet composition of pikeperch in Feldberger Haussee were studied. From 1996 to 1998, the population was dominated by two cohorts. Only in years with warm summers, recruitment from 0+ fish to older age-classes was successful. It appears likely that due to the relatively high depth of the lake the spawning period is delayed as a result of a slower temperature increase in spring. Therefore, 0+ pikeperch cannot benefit from the spring maximum of the zooplankton. This may be the reason for the slow growth and consequently, hampers the switch to piscivory for the majority of 0+ pikeperch. However, after becoming piscivorous, the pikeperch showed a reasonably good growth. Predation was mainly directed towards roach and 0+ perch, the major planktivores. The results of the present study confirm the role of pikeperch as an efficient predator of zooplanktivorous fish in open-water dominated lakes. Yet, it is suggested that the probability of successful recruitment of pikeperch in deeper, stratified lakes is reduced. Therefore, stable self-sustaining pikeperch populations cannot be expected in such lakes and regular stocking measures may be necessary even if a potential spawning stock exists.

We applied a mobile under-ice echo-survey and catch sampling from winter seining. The sounder with a tape recorder was placed in a shuttle and towed under ice from hole to hole with a rope. The mean fish density was 4270 fish ha(-1). Vendace biomass was estimated to be ca. 36 tonnes. Commercial fishing started on a restricted scale after the completion of the assessment. The vendace yield was ca. 6 tonnes in the area during the remainder of the winter-seining season. The total winter seining catch amounted to ca. 40% of the initial vendace stock size in January 2000.																			1239-6095					NOV 29	2006	11	6					415	420																WOS:000242891000001

Seasonal and annual variation in the diet of the raccoon dog Nyctereutes procyonoides in northern Belarus: the role of habitat type and family group	ACTA THERIOLOGICA												To study variation in the diet of the raccoon dog Nyctereutes procyonoides Gray, 1834 in northern Belarus, 3299 scats were sampled from 18 localities differing in habitat quality. In one of the 18 localities, the dietary study was conducted for nine years. The data obtained was analysed according to seasonality, between-year difference, family specificity and habitat influence. In northern Belarus, the raccoon dog was found to be a generalist predator with omnivorous and opportunistic feeding habits. Their diet was highly variable, but a common trait was specialization on carrion in winter and on berries in late summer. Beside carrion and berries, the other seasonally important food items were frogs, insects, plant matter, mammals, and birds. The diet varied between seasons and habitats. In the warm season, habitat factors, such as type of soil (clay or sand), proportion of lakes and open grassy marshes, seemingly determine the food supply for raccoon dogs, and thereby influence the diet of individuals. The obtained results on dietary variation of raccoon dogs can be used in detailed analysis of the impact of this introduced species on native fauna and its role in functioning of vertebrate communities.

Mixing of shallow and deep groundwater as indicated by the chemistry and age of karstic springs (vol 14, pg 827, 2006)	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Large karstic springs in east-central Florida, USA were studied using multi-tracer and geochemical modeling techniques to better understand groundwater flow paths and mixing of shallow and deep groundwater. Spring water types included Ca-HCO3 (six), Na-Cl (four), and mixed (one). The evolution of water chemistry for Ca-HCO3 spring waters was modeled by reactions of rainwater with soil organic matter, calcite, and dolomite under oxic conditions. The Na-Cl and mixed-type springs were modeled by reactions of either rainwater or Upper Floridan aquifer water with soil organic matter, calcite, and dolomite under oxic conditions and mixed with varying proportions of saline Lower Floridan aquifer water, which represented 4-53% of the total spring discharge. Multiple-tracer data-chlorofluorocarbon CFC-113, tritium (H-3), helium-3 (He-3(trit)), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)-for four Ca-HCO3 spring waters were consistent with binary mixing curves representing water recharged during 1980 or 1990 mixing with an older (recharged before 1940) tracer-free component. Young-water mixing fractions ranged from 0.3 to 0.7. Tracer concentration data for two Na-Cl spring waters appear to be consistent with binary mixtures of 1990 water with older water recharged in 1965 or 1975. Nitrate-N concentrations are inversely related to apparent ages of spring waters, which indicated that elevated nitrate-N concentrations were likely contributed from recent recharge.																			1431-2174					SEP	2006	14	6					1060	1080		10.1007/s10040-006-0099-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-006-0099-z													WOS:000241103800019

Assessing environmental controls on the distribution of long-chain alkenones in the Canadian Prairies	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Long-chain alkenones (LCAs) have been used for decades to reconstruct quantitative sea-surface temperature records, but they also have a great potential for paleotemperature reconstructions in lacustrine settings. Here, we investigated how the presence and abundance of LCAs in surface sediments from 106 lakes varied with environmental conditions in lakes of the northern Great Plains (Canadian Prairies) in southern Saskatchewan, Canada. Consistent with preliminary research, we found LCAs in 55% of surveyed lakes, with mean concentrations of 143 mu g/g dry sediment, but very high concentrations (up to 2.3 mg/g dry sediment) in 7% of lakes. Statistical analyses indicate that salinity and stratification play key roles in determining LCA presence and abundance supporting previous research in Spain and the northern Great Plains, USA. Overall, the alkenone unsaturation index (U-37(K)) was not correlated significantly with average summer water temperature, probably because the timing of maximum LCA production occurs during the spring season. We conclude that improved seasonal sampling is required within the study lakes to better identify the timing and habitat of haptophyte production, and allow development of environmental temperature reconstruction tools.

Interpopulation variation in a fish predator drives evolutionary divergence in prey in lakes	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Ecological factors are known to cause evolutionary diversification. Recent work has shown that evolution in strongly interacting predator species has reciprocal impacts on ecosystems. These divergent impacts of predators may alter the selective landscape and cause the evolution of prey. Yet, this link between intraspecific variation and evolution is unexplored. We compared the life history of a species of zooplankton (Daphnia ambigua) from lakes in New England in which the dominant planktivorous predator, the alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), differs in feeding traits and migratory behaviour. Anadromous alewife (seasonal migrants) exhibit larger gapes, gill-raker spacing and target larger prey than landlocked alewife (year-round freshwater resident). In 'anadromous' lakes, Daphnia are abundant in the spring but extirpated by alewife predation in summer. Daphnia are rare year-round in 'landlocked' lakes. We show that Daphnia from lakes with anadromous alewife grew faster, matured earlier but at the same size and produced more offspring than Daphnia from lakes with landlocked or no alewife across multiple temperature and resource treatments. Our results are inconsistent with a response to size-selective predation but are better explained as an adaptation to colder temperatures and shorter periods of development (countergradient variation) mediated by seasonal alewife predation.

J	Roy, JW				Roy, James W.			Endobenthic Organisms Exposed to Chronically High Chloride from Groundwater Discharging along Freshwater Urban Streams and Lakeshores	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Chloride, especially from road salt, is one of the most ubiquitous contaminants of urban groundwater in temperate climates. The discharge of chloride-laden groundwater to freshwater ecosystems may pose a heightened risk to endobenthic organisms (buried in sediments), which may experience high concentrations prior to dilution from the overlying water. However, available exposure data is limited. Presented here are 22 chloride data sets from 15 urban sites across Canada, encompassing >1300 samples of shallow discharging groundwater collected principally during summer through autumn. Over half of the sites had an average chloride concentration above the long-term aquatic life guideline (120 mg/L), while 14% of each site's samples, on average, surpassed the short-term guideline (640 mg/L). Chloride concentrations frequently varied substantially (even >1000 mg/L) between adjacent locations (mostly <20 m separation), indicating patchy exposure. Chloride/bromide ratios, artificial sweeteners, and other tracers suggest a predominant contribution from road salt, with wastewater and landfill leachate important at some sites. Overall, these concentrations exceed those typically reported for urban wells and streams (even during the snowmelt period) in similar climates. These findings suggest that high chloride concentrations in shallow groundwater, largely from road salt, present a long-term threat to endobenthic organisms of urban surface waters in cold-region countries.

The fate of glucose carbon, including the formation of CO, and biomass, was assayed by using undisturbed cores and [U-C-14]glucose; the production of short-chain fatty acids was monitored with [U-C-14]glucose and sediment slurries. Rate constants for glucose uptake varied temporally, with temperature accounting for much of the variability; turnover times ranged from about 2 to 10 min. Rate constants decreased with increasing sediment depth and in the following order for several common monosaccharides: glucose>galactose>mannose-fucose. Time course analySeS of (CO2)-C-14 production provided evidence of significant isotopic dilution; although pore water glucose turnover times were on the order of minutes, (CO2)-C-14 did not plateau until after approximately 6 h of incubation. At this time a maximum of about 40% of the added radioglucose had been respired. The extent of respiration varied as a function of sediment depth and season, with the highest values below the surface (4 to 7 cm) and in summer and fall. Incorporation of radiolabelled glucose into biomass also varied seasonally, but the greatest extent of incorporation (about 40%) was observed in the fall and for the 0- to 1-cm depth interval. The production of short-chain fatty acid end products was largely limited to acetate, which accounted for only a small percentage of the added radiolabel. Other organic acids, pyruvate in particular, were observed in pore water and were due to artifacts in the heat-kill procedure used to terminate incubations. An accurate assessment of the distribution and importance of short-chain fatty acids as end products required the use of an enzymatic technique coupled with high-pressure liquid chromatography to verify qualitative identities.

Preliminary study on migration pattern of the Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii) based on satellite tracking	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH												The spatial and temporal patterns of the endangered Tibetan antelope or chiru (Pantholops hodgsonii) have been studied using satellite-based ARGOS platform transmitter terminal (PTT) tracking data. The data was obtained from the satellite tracking of two female Tibetan antelopes that were collared with satellite transmitters and have been tracked from August 2007 to April 2009. Analysis of the locality data (LC) obtained, shows that both antelopes were migrant individuals, they shared the same calving ground surrounding lake Huiten (or Zhuonai lake), but different wintering pastures. Each antelope covered 250-300 km from the wintering to summer pastures. Annual range consisted of a core area that was used for at least 9 months; a calving ground used for a short time (from 820 days); and temporal pastures used during migration to and from the calving ground. Seasonal migration cycle was about 3 months, 27-30 days to reach the calving ground; 8-20 days staying there; and 36-40 days returning to the core area. Examination of the spatial distribution during migration showed that both chiru crossed the Qinghai-Tibetan railway (QTR) and the Golmud-Lhasa highway (GLH) at least two times, and reached calving ground (118-120 km from there) in 8 days, maintaining an average speed of 15 km per day. However, the return migration took twice as long (from 14 to 16 days). Each time, after reaching the QTR and GLH, the antelopes spent 20-40 days in that area, probably looking for passages and waiting. So far, we suppose that the QTR and the GLH have become a hindrance to the migration of the Tibetan antelopes and seriously delay their movement to and from the calving area.

Fluxes of fossil pigments and algal remains were very low before the 1960s, but increased through the 1960s and 1970s, indicating that the lake had eutrophied in the 20 years since 1960. After 1980, however, fluxes of all fossil pigments and algal remains decreased or stabilized. Redundancy analysis with meteorological and limnological variables explained more than 70% of the variation of these fluxes and showed that the decrease in fluxes of most algal taxa that occurred in the 1980s was related to changes in meteorological variables such as wind velocity, rather than changes in the lake's trophic state. Sedimentary records of algal remains also revealed that Aulacoseira nipponica, an endemic diatom species that grows in winter, decreased dramatically after 1980, while Fragilaria crotonensis, a cosmopolitan spring diatom species, became dominant. Replacement of one dominant diatom species by another could not be explained simply by changes in the lake trophic state, but was reasonably strongly related with an increase in winter water temperature. These results suggest that the phytoplankton community in Lake Biwa was influenced by changes in local environmental conditions (nutrient loading) through the 1960s and 1970s, but more so by regional (meteorological) and global (climate warming) factors since 1980.

Comparison of fish consumption and Daphnia mortality and life history parameters in a biomanipulated reservoir	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												We analysed the temporal pattern of a Daphnia galeata population and the development of the age-0 fish community in a long-term biomanipulated lake (Bautzen reservoir, Germany) during spring and early summer of two successive years. In Bautzen reservoir, the age-0 fish-Daphnia interaction is a key process within the food web due to the low abundance of adult zooplanktivorous fish. Daily consumption of daphnids by age-0 fish, as estimated by a bioenergetics model, was compared to daily mortality rates of daphnids. In addition, we estimated life history parameters of Daphnia that may indicate predation impact by fish. A midsummer decline of daphnids occurred only in July of 1996, whereas in 1995 the Daphnia biomass remained >4 mg wet weight l(-1) for the entire summer. The percentage of total Daphnia mortality due to fish predation before the onset of the midsummer decline was similar to 2% day(-1). Temporal patterns of individual size, clutch size and size at maturity also indicated that the 1996 midsummer decline of daphnids was not the exclusive consequence of age-0 fish predation. Instead, low reproductive capacity of daphnids also contributed significantly to the decline. Consequently, year-to-year variation of the Daphnia dynamics may be determined by a fine-tuned 'timing' between the period of reduced fecundity and the time of the strongest predation impact by age-0 fish.

Extreme water quality degradation following a catastrophic forest fire	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Global change is impacting the forests of the western United States through rising temperatures, earlier snowmelt, more rain and less snow, greater vapour pressure deficits in spring and autumn, forest dieback and increasing forest fire frequency and severity. A catastrophic forest fire (Las Conchas fire) occurred in central NM, USA, in 2011 burning c. 634km(2) with c. 46% of the fire being of severe or moderate intensity. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) next-generation radar data (NEXRAD) were used to link precipitation events occurring in the burn scar to extreme water quality excursions observed in the Rio Grande. At four sites, in situ sensors captured the response of water temperature, specific conductance, pH, turbidity and dissolved oxygen to flood events following the fire. Runoff from burn scars caused turbidity peaks (to 2500 NTU), dissolved oxygen sags (to 0.0mgL(-1)), pH sags (up to 0.75 units) and conductivity changes (both increases and decreases). These water quality excursions extended at least 50km downstream, with significant implications for the ecosystem health of this crucial river that supplies water to cities and agriculture. Sudden, dramatic changes to forested catchments from severe forest fires and forest dieback are very likely to be among the strongest impacts of global change on stream and river ecosystems throughout the western United States.

Using Canonical Correspondence Analyses, we have examined how both habitat conditions within lakes and environmental factors over broad geographical scales explained the distribution of the 151 most common summer dominant species. The distributions of these species were best explained by water colour and latitude, although alkalinity and total phosphorus also appeared to be important explanatory factors. Contrary to our original hypothesis, summer water temperatures had a negligible impact on the distribution of dominants, although, due to the restricted summer season we examined, only a limited temperature gradient was present in the dataset. Cryptophytes occurred more frequently among dominants in Northern Europe whereas cyanobacteria and dinophytes dominated more in Central and Southern Europe. Our analyses suggest that besides nutrient concentrations, other water chemistry variables, such as alkalinity and the content of humic substances, have at least as important a role in determining the distribution of the dominant phytoplankton species in European lakes.

Strong temporal variations were documented for the projected particle area per unit volume (PAV), and the relative contribution that six chemical groupings of particles made to the overall assemblage of particles. These dynamics were regulated largely by (1) the composition and level of phytoplankton growth, (2) tributary loading of particles, particularly after runoff events, and (3) the precipitation of calcium carbonate. Approximately 85% of the PAV was associated with in-lake processes and approximately 15% was derived from tributary transport. Approximately 25% of the internally produced PAV was related to calcium carbonate precipitation; the remainder was associated with biological production. A once in 7-year runoff event caused a 5-fold increase in the concentration of suspended particles. Much of the increase was due to calcium carbonate precipitation that coated various nuclei particles.																			0013-936X					APR	1991	25	4					736	744		10.1021/es00016a020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00016a020													WOS:A1991FE65200028
J	MOYLE, JB				MOYLE, JB			SOME CHEMICAL FACTORS INFLUENCING THE DISTRIBUTION OF AQUATIC PLANTS IN MINNESOTA	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												As detd. from investigations of 225 Minnesota lakes and streams, the aquatic plants of these waters fall into 3 general groups when related to water chem-istry: (1) the soft-water flora of which Lobelia dortmanna, Isoetes braunii and Eriocaulon septangulare are typical, and which is usually limited to waters with a total alkalinity<40 ppm., a sulfate ion conc.<5 ppm., and a summer pH of surface waters<7.4; (2) the hard-water flora of which the commoner pondweeds Ceratophyllum and Chara are characteristic, and which is best developed in waters with a total alkalinity between 90 and 250 ppm., sulfate ion concn.<50 ppm., and a summer pH of surface waters between 8 and 8.8; and (3) the alkali-water flora of which Ruppia occiden-talis, Najas marina and Scirpus paludosus are typical and which is best developed in waters with a total alkalinity>150 ppm., a sulfate ion cone.>125 ppm., and a summer pH of surface waters between 8.4 and 9.2. Some spp. are limited to a single water type; others show a wider range of tolerance. Typical hard-water spp. were usually lacking or rare in waters with a total alkalinity<30 ppm., some were not taken from waters in which the sulfate ion conc. exceeded 50 ppm., and nearly all were absent or made poor growth in waters with a concn. of sulfate ion>300 ppm. Typical alkali-water spp. were not taken from waters with a sulfate ion conc.<50 ppm. Chemical data for waters associated with 85 of the commoner aquatic plants are included. Exptl. growth of L. dortmanna, R. occidentalis and Lemna minor in natural waters of different chemical qualities shows that these spp. do not make successful growth in waters differing from those in which they naturally occur.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1945	34	2					402	420		10.2307/2421128	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2421128													WOS:A1945YA67900006

The aim of this study was to investigate seasonal and temporal trends of 18 PAHs accumulated in native Dreissena polymorpha specimens during a 5-year biomonitoring program, as well as to identify the possible PAH emission sources by using isomeric diagnostic ratios. Zebra mussels were sampled both in their pre- (May) and post-reproductive (September) stage over the 2008-2012 period in eight sampling stations covering the whole lake shoreline. PAH concentrations were measured through gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. A notable PAH contamination following an increasing temporal trend was noticed in bivalves from all the sampling stations, with the benzo(alpha)anthracene as the predominant compound. An overall increase in PAH levels was found in the post-reproductive surveys, indicating a marked seasonality of this contamination probably due to the increase in touristic activity during spring-summer months.

J	Kaneko, S				Kaneko, S			Seasonal population changes of five parasitoids attacking the scale insect Nipponaclerda biwakoensis on the common reed, with special reference to predation by wintering birds	ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE												Seasonal changes in the abundance of five species of hymenopterous parasitoids (four species of Encyrtidae and one species of Eulophidae) attacking the scale insect Nipponaclerda biwakoensis on the common reed were investigated for 2 years in Lake Biwa, with special reference to predation by the reed bunting, Emberiza schoeniclus, during winter. The scales settled on reed shoot stems under sheath leaves, passing through three discrete generations per year. The abundance of adult female scales increased exponentially from July (first generation) to December (third generation). Adult female scales of the third generation overwintered on reed shoots. During winter, female scale abundance dramatically declined, whereas the number of predation marks made by reed buntings using their bills on reed sheath leaves increased. The generations of all five parasitoids were synchronized with the host scale generations, and the five parasitoids overwintered as larvae inside the scale bodies. The abundance of parasitized scales and parasitoid adults emerging from the scales also increased from July to December, but greatly decreased during winter. The overall parasitism rate of the female scales remained at relatively low levels (less than 40%) throughout the year, including before and after winter. A bird exclusion experiment revealed that the dramatic winter decrease of the abundance of the scale and its five parasitoids was due to intensive and non-selective predation by the buntings on unparasitized and parasitized scales. Additionally, the proportion of immature parasitoids removed by birds varied between the five parasitoid species. Thus, seasonal population changes of the five scale parasitoids are considerably affected by bird predation on overwintering immature parasitoids.																			1343-8786	1479-8298				DEC	2005	8	4					323	329		10.1111/j.1479-8298.2005.00131.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1479-8298.2005.00131.x													WOS:000234204900002

The majority of core sediments were characterized by dark-grayish, fine-grained mud with abundant gas-escaped and thinly laminated layers. Intervals of summer and winter seasons were represented by periodic peaks of geochemical profiles of parameters such as grain size and relative carbon mass ratios to various nutrients such as nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus. In bacteria, Proteobacteria (66.6%) was the most prevalent phylum, followed by Chloroflexi (8.9%), Bacteroidetes (5.1%), and Spirochaetes (2.6%). Archaea were also abundant, representing approximately half of the total prokaryotes in the sediments. Notably, three Bacteria (Sulfuricurvum, Sideroxydans, and Gallionella) and one Archaea (Thermoplasmata) accounted for 43.4% and 38.4% of the total bacteria and archaea, respectively, implying that iron and sulfur oxidizing microorganisms dominate in this eutrophic freshwater sediment. These results indicate that 1) eutrophic freshwater lakes in monsoon climates undergo a stratified sedimentary process with seasonal and annual variations in geochemical and microbial profiles, and 2) the microbial oxidative metabolism of iron and sulfur is notably active in sediments from a eutrophic lake.

In this study, spatiotemporal distribution characteristics were investigated by analyzing the dustfall fluxes and heavy metal contents in six cities of the Ebinur Lake Basin during heating (Winter) and nonheating (Summer) periods. The possible sources with impact potential on human activities were identified using the principal component model analysis and multiple linear regression (PCA-MLR), so the human health risk of heavy metal exposure to dustfall was assessed. The result revealed that the atmospheric dust flux in the nonheating period was higher than that in the heating period. Temporally, the concentrations of all heavy metals except Cd and Pb in atmospheric dustfall were higher in the heating period than in the nonheating period. Half of the heavy metals have spatial distribution variations. Cr, As and Pb show both carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic risks to the human body, and the carcinogenic risk of Cr exceeds the maximum acceptable level by more than ten times. Source apportionment analysis showed that heavy metals in the atmospheric dust of the Ebinur Lake Basin mainly came from fuel combustion and soil dust during the nonheating period, followed by industrial dust sources and traffic sources, while in the heating period, heavy metals mainly came from the various sources of both soil dust and building material dust, followed by industrial activities such as coal combustion, industrial dust and automobile exhaust. The results of the study will provide useful insights into dustfall source apportionment and provide a basis for decision-making in regional air pollution control.					ge, yongxiao/K-1251-2012; ma, long/JHU-2289-2023	Ma, Long/0000-0002-8233-8640; 													1352-2310	1873-2844				MAR 1	2022	272								118950	10.1016/j.atmosenv.2022.118950	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2022.118950		JAN 2022											WOS:000788242000002

Visual Active Space of the Milfoil Weevil, Euhrychiopsis lecontei Dietz (Coleoptera: Curculionidae)	JOURNAL OF INSECT BEHAVIOR												Euhrychiopsis lecontei Dietz (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), a native weevil, is used as a biological control agent for the invasive aquatic macrophyte, Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.). Because E. lecontei over-winters on land in the adult stage and must find plants in lakes each spring, plant finding behaviors are essential to eventually understanding and predicting long term biological control. Our research showed that E. lecontei is visually attracted to M. spicatum at up to 17.5 cm, and is more attracted to plants than other visual stimuli within 15 cm. We also showed that turbidity may affect visual plant finding at 15 cm. Using available data from this and other previous studies involving chemical cues and other life history traits, we propose a testable conceptual model for how E. lecontei finds plants each year, especially while underwater. This model may also be used to explain plant finding by aquatic phytophagous insects in general.

J	Konoplev, A				Konoplev, Alexei			Fukushima and Chernobyl: Similarities and Differences of Radiocesium Behavior in the Soil-Water Environment	TOXICS												In the wake of Chernobyl and Fukushima accidents, radiocesium has become a radionuclide of most environmental concern. The ease with which this radionuclide moves through the environment and is taken up by plants and animals is governed by its chemical forms and site-specific environmental characteristics. Distinctions in climate and geomorphology, as well as Cs-137 speciation in the fallout, result in differences in the migration rates of Cs-137 in the environment and rates of its natural attenuation. In Fukushima areas, Cs-137 was strongly bound to soil and sediment particles, with its bioavailability being reduced as a result. Up to 80% of the deposited Cs-137 on the soil was reported to be incorporated in hot glassy particles (CsMPs) insoluble in water. Disintegration of these particles in the environment is much slower than that of Chernobyl-derived fuel particles. The higher annual precipitation and steep slopes in Fukushima-contaminated areas are conducive to higher erosion and higher total radiocesium wash-off. Among the common features in the Cs-137 behavior in Chernobyl and Fukushima are a slow decrease in the Cs-137 activity concentration in small, closed, and semi-closed lakes and its particular seasonal variations: increase in the summer and decrease in the winter.

Three lakes were selected for examination (Radunskie Gorne, Zbiczno and Ostrowite). Their maximum depths slightly exceed 40 m, and their surface areas range from 121 to 362.5 ha. The results of the measurements show that, despite only minor differences in depth, water temperature varied significantly between the studied lakes. These differences were mainly apparent in the extent of the epilimnion, water thermal stratification, and in the water temperature in the bottom-most layers in summer and winter. The diversity in thermal stratification of the lakes is mainly determined by their morphometric properties, their location above sea level, and the dynamic influences of winds.					; Piasecki, Adam/CAJ-4274-2022	Piasecki, Adam/0000-0002-8787-7520; 													2080-7686	2300-8490				DEC	2014	7	1					105	119		10.2478/bgeo-2014-0005	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/bgeo-2014-0005													WOS:000215141700005

Fluorescence in situ hybridization indicated that, above 24% salinity, the prokaryotic community shifted from bacterial to archaeal dominance with a remarkable increase in the proportion of detected cells. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles were rather similar in all the samples analyzed, except in the lowest salinity pond (around 20% salt) where several specific archaeal and bacterial phylotypes were detected. In spite of previous studies on these salterns, DGGE analysis unveiled the presence of microorganisms not previously described in these ponds, such as Archaea related to Natronomonas or bacteria related to Alkalimnicola, as well as many new sequences of Bacteroidetes. Some phylotypes, such as those related to Haloquadratum or to some Bacteroidetes, displayed a strong dependence of salinity and/or magnesium concentrations, which in the case of Haloquadratum could be related to the presence of ecotypes. Seasonal variability in the prokaryotic community composition was focused on two ponds with the lowest (20%) and the highest salinity (36%). In contrast to the crystallized pond, where comparable profiles between autumn 2007 and summer 2008 were obtained, the non-crystallized pond showed pronounced seasonal changes and a sharp succession of "species" during the year. Canonical correspondence analysis of biological and physicochemical parameters indicated that temperature was a strong factor structuring the prokaryotic community in the non-crystallizer pond, that had salinities ranging from 20 to 23.8% during the year.

The hydrological influence of SFG is complex and varies under different climatic and physiographic conditions. The summer rainfall dominant climate pattern in Qinghai Lake Basin (QLB) leads to a significantly different seasonal freeze-thaw process and groundwater flow compared to regions with winter snowfall dominated precipitation. The seasonal hydrological processes in QLB are not fully understood due to the lack of soil temperature and groundwater observation data. A coupled surface and subsurface thermal hydrology model was applied to simulate the freeze-thaw process of SFG and groundwater flow in the QLB. The results indicate that SFG begins to freeze in early November, reaches a maximum freezing depth of approximately 2 meters in late March, and thaws completely by June. This freeze-thaw process is primarily governed by the daily air temperature variations. During the early rainy season from April to June, the remaining SFG in deep soil hinders the majority of rainwater infiltration, resulting in a two-month delay in the peak of groundwater discharge compared to scenario with no SFG present. Colder conditions intensify this effect, delaying peak discharge by 3 months, whereas warmer conditions reduce the lag to 1 month. The ice saturation distribution along the hillslope is affected by topography, with a 10 cm deeper ice saturation distribution and 3 days delay of groundwater discharge in the steep case compared to the flat case. These findings highlight the importance of the freeze-thaw process of SFG on hydrological processes in regions dominated by summer rainfall, providing valuable insights into the hydro-ecological response. Enhanced understanding of these dynamics may improve water resource management strategies and support future research into climate-hydrology interactions in SFG-dominated landscapes.					ding, chen/KDN-1285-2024; Zheng, Chunmiao/I-5257-2014; Fan, Linfeng/GLQ-7236-2022; Kuang, Xingxing/F-6080-2019	Zheng, Chunmiao/0000-0001-5839-1305; 														2624-9375				NOV 22	2024	6								1495763	10.3389/frwa.2024.1495763	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2024.1495763													WOS:001370766500001

Crossing Treeline: Bacterioplankton Communities of Alpine and Subalpine Rocky Mountain Lakes	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												From the aboveground vegetation to the belowground microbes, terrestrial communities differ between the highly divergent alpine (above treeline) and subalpine (below treeline) ecosystems. Yet, much less is known about the partitioning of microbial communities between alpine and subalpine lakes. Our goal was to determine whether the composition of bacterioplankton communities of high-elevation mountain lakes differed across treeline, identify key players in driving the community composition, and identify potential environmental factors that may be driving differences. To do so, we compared bacterial community composition (using 16S rDNA sequencing) of alpine and subalpine lakes in the Southern Rocky Mountain ecoregion at two time points: once in the early summer and once in the late summer. In the early summer (July), shortly after peak runoff, bacterial communities of alpine lakes were distinct from subalpine lakes. Interestingly, by the end of the summer (approximately 5 weeks after the first visit in August), bacterial communities of alpine and subalpine lakes were no longer distinct. Several bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were also identified as key players by significantly contributing to the community dissimilarity. The community divergence across treeline found in the early summer was correlated with several environmental factors, including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), pH, chlorophyll-a (chl-a), and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN). In this paper, we offer several potential scenarios driven by both biotic and abiotic factors that could lead to the observed patterns. While the mechanisms for these patterns are yet to be determined, the community dissimilarity in the early summer correlates with the timing of increased hydrologic connections with the terrestrial environment. Springtime snowmelt brings the flushing of mountain watersheds that connects terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This connectivity declines precipitously throughout the summer after snowmelt is complete. Regional climate change is predicted to bring alterations to precipitation and snowpack, which can modify the flushing of solutes, nutrients, and terrestrial microbes into lakes. Future preservation of the unique alpine lake ecosystem is dependent on a better understanding of ecosystem partitioning across treeline and careful consideration of terrestrial-aquatic connections in mountain watersheds.					; SCHMIDT, STEVEN K/G-2771-2010; Schmidt, Steven/G-2771-2010	Holland-Moritz, Hannah/0000-0002-0854-872X; SCHMIDT, STEVEN K/0000-0002-9175-2085; 														1664-302X				JAN 3	2022	12								533121	10.3389/fmicb.2021.533121	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.533121								35046907					WOS:000745148600001

The main objective of this study was to conduct the monthly trophic state assessments of waters in Wuhan from March 2019 to June 2020 using 111 Sentinel-2 images. The Forel-Ule index (FUI) and empirical Gaussian process regression (GPR) were, respectively, applied to obtain monthly area percentage (AP) of waters with each trophic state. Both FUI-derived and empirical GPR-retrieved results showed that majority of water bodies (>90%) in Wuhan were in mesotrophic and eutrophic states. The GPR-retrieved results based on FUI-derived water types were more reliable than the retrieval without classification, which reduced RMSE of trophic-level index (TLI) from 9.2 to 5.8, and MAPE from 14% to 9% (N = 213). Severe eutrophication occurred in the summer and early autumn (June-October). Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis indicated that temperature and wind speed were the two most important meteorological factors influencing eutrophication variability: the temperature accounted for 63% and 55% dynamic eutrophication from FUI-derived and GPR-retrieved results, respectively; the wind speed explained 44% and 52% variability of FUI-derived and GPR-retrieved results.

J	Wilson, CJN				Wilson, CJN			The 26.5 ka Oruanui eruption, New Zealand: an introduction and overview	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The 26.5 ka Oruanui eruption, from Taupo volcano in the central North Island of New Zealand, is the largest known 'wet' eruption, generating 430 km(3) of fall deposits, 320 km(3) of pyroclastic density-current (PDC) deposits (mostly ignimbrite) and similar to420 km(3) of primary intracaldera material, equivalent to similar to530 km(3) of magma. Erupted magma is >99% rhyolite and <1% relatively mafic compositions (52.3-63.3% SiO2). The latter vary in abundance, at different stratigraphic levels from 0.1 to 4 wt%, defining three 'spikes' that are used to correlate fall and coeval PDC activity. The eruption is divided into 10 phases on the basis of nine mappable fall units and a tenth, poorly preserved but volumetrically dominant fall unit. Fall units 1-9 individually range from 0.8 to 85 km(3) and unit 10, by subtraction, is 265 km(3); all fall deposits are of wide (plinian) to extremely wide dispersal. Fall deposits show a wide range of depositional states, from dry to water saturated, reflecting varied pyroclast:water ratios. Multiple bedding and normal grading in the fall deposits show the first third of the eruption was very spasmodic; short-lived but intense bursts of activity were separated by time breaks from zero up to several weeks to months. PDC activity occurred throughout the eruption. Both dilute and concentrated. currents are inferred to have, been present from deposit characteristics, with the latter being volumetrically dominant (>90%). PDC deposits range from mm- to cm-thick. ultrathin veneers enclosed within fall material to >200 m-thick ignimbrite in proximal areas. The farthest travelled (similar to90 km), most energetic PDCs (velocities >100 m s(-1)) occurred during phase 8, but the most voluminous PDC deposits were emplaced during phase 10. Grain size variations in the PDC deposits are complex, with changes seen vertically in thick, proximal accumulations being greater than those seen laterally from near-source to most-distal deposits. Modern Lake Taupo partly infills the caldera generated during this eruption: a similar to140 km(2) structural collapse area is concealed beneath the lake, while the lake outline reflects coeval peripheral and volcano-tectonic collapse. Early eruption phases saw shifting vent positions, development of the caldera to its maximum extent (indicated by lithic lag breccias) occurred during phase 10. The Oruanui eruption shows many unusual features; its episodic nature, wide range of depositional conditions in fall deposits of very wide dispersal, and complex interplay of fall and PDC activity.

J	Perez, ES				Perez, ES			Springs in Spain: Classification according to their flows and lithologies and their hydraulic contributions	GROUND WATER												This paper presents an approach to regional hydrological balance where the number and integrated discharge of springs are used to estimate recharge. This technique is applied to Spain, where approximately two-thirds of the country has an inventory of spring lithology and discharge (17,000 springs). The data are used to extrapolate results to the entire region and are compared to independent methods of estimating recharge. This is an informative use of commonly available information and it could be applied to other regions with a similar data base. From this sample, a distribution of the spring flow volume contribution in Spain is estimated (a) according to flow spring discharge, (b) as a limit of a lognormal distribution, which in our sample is simplified in a potential formula a(x) = 24,101.x(-0.91). In this way it is calculated that the total flow volume of the springs is 14,877 hm(3)/yr. The study does not take into account seepage (diffuse discharge) draining to seas, rivers, or lakes but only water at the spring source. The most permeable lithological groups considered are the source of 94.2% of the total flow supplied by the springs. Limestone is especially significant, contributing 66.2%. The net recharge of precipitation to ground water varies widely according to lithologies. It reaches to 20.3% in limestones and drops to less than 1% for quartzites, slates, and plutonic rocks.																			0017-467X					NOV-DEC	1996	34	6					1033	1041		10.1111/j.1745-6584.1996.tb02169.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.1996.tb02169.x													WOS:A1996VQ57500012

Investigation of microbial metabolisms in an extremely high pH marine-like terrestrial serpentinizing system: Ney Springs	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Ney Springs, a continental serpentinizing spring in northern California, has an exceptionally high reported pH (12.4) for a naturally occurring water source. With high conductivity fluids, it is geochemically more akin to marine serpentinizing systems than other terrestrial locations. Our geochemical analyses also revealed high sulfide concentrations (544 mg/L) and methane emissions (83% volume gas content) relative to other serpentinizing systems. Thermodynamic calculations were used to investigate the potential for substrates resulting from serpentinization to fuel microbial life, and were found to support the energetic feasibility of sulfate reduction, anaerobic methane oxidation, denitrification, and anaerobic sulfide oxidation within this system. Assessment of the microbial community via 16S rRNA taxonomic gene surveys and metagenome sequencing revealed a community composition dominated by poorly characterized members of the Izemoplasmatales and Clostridiales. The genomes of these dominant taxa point to a fermentative lifestyle, though other highly complete (>90%) metagenome assembled genomes support the potential for organisms to perform sulfate reduction, sulfur disproportionation and/or sulfur oxidation (aerobic and anaerobic). Two chemolithoheterotrophs identified in the metagenome, a Halomonas sp. and a Rhodobacteraceae sp., were isolated and shown to oxidize thiosulfate and were capable of growth in conditions up to pH 12.4. Despite being characteristic products of serpentinization reactions, little evidence was seen for hydrogen and methane utilization in the Ney Springs microbial community. Hydrogen is not highly abundant and could be consumed prior to reaching the spring community. Other metabolic strategies may be outcompeted by more energetically favorable heterotrophic or fermentation reactions, or even inhibited by other compounds in the spring such as ammonia. The unique geochemistry of Ney Springs provides an opportunity to study how local geology interacts with serpentinized fluids, while its microbial community can better inform us of the metabolic strategies employed in hyperalkaline environments.					; Rowe, Annette/LPP-6903-2024	Rowe, Annette/0000-0002-8761-6857; Chadwick, Grayson/0000-0003-0700-9350; Trutschel, Leah/0000-0002-0596-6977; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				AUG 25	2022	836								155492	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155492	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155492		MAY 2022						35476949					WOS:000831169800011

As climate change in sub-Arctic regions leads to the most pronounced temperature increases in winter, it results in shorter operating seasons and threatens essential supply and access routes. Different systems of funding and documenting this infrastructure have left an inconsistent federal record of varying temporal and spatial accuracy. Here, we have assembled a dataset that presents verified winter roads to First Nations communities for the 2022-23 season, categorised by surface type land, river ice, and lake ice. Newly constructed all-season roads and previously undocumented local roads are included, as are ice crossings connecting permanent highways. Current location and distance information can thus be derived from this easily updated dataset and used as a base for further analysis and infrastructure planning as part of a strategy to supply and connect remote First Nations.					; Spagnolo, Matteo/G-2415-2011	Mullan, Donal/0000-0002-6363-3150; 													0165-232X	1872-7441				NOV	2025	239								104590	10.1016/j.coldregions.2025.104590	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coldregions.2025.104590													WOS:001530721300001

Stable isotope (O and C) and pollen trends in eastern Lake Erie, evidence for a locally-induced climatic reversal of Younger Dryas age in the Great Lakes basin	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												A cool period from about 11000 to 10500 BP (11 to 10.5 ka) is recognized in pollen records from the southern Great Lakes area by the return of Picea and Abies dominance and by the persistence of herbs. The area of cooling appears centred on the Upper Great Lakes. A high-resolution record (ca. 9 mm/y) from a borehole in eastern Lake Erie reveals, in the same time interval, this pollen anomaly, isotope evidence of meltwater presence (a-3 per rail shift in delta(18)O and a + 1.1 per mil shift in delta(13)C), increased sand, and reduced detrital calcite content, all suggesting concurrent cooling of Lake Erie. The onset of cooling is mainly attributed to the effect of enhanced meltwater inflow on the relatively large upstream Main Lake Algonquin during the first eastward discharge of glacial Lake Agassiz. Termination of the cooling coincides with drainage of Lake Algonquin, and is attributed to loss of its cooling effectiveness associated with a substantial reduction in its surface area. It is hypothesized that the cold extra inflow effectively prolonged the seasonal presence of lake ice and the period of spring overturn in Lake Algonquin. The deep mixing would have greatly increased the thermal conductive capacity of this extensive lake, causing suppression of summer surface lake-water temperatures and reduction of onshore growing degree days. Alternatively, a rapid flow of meltwater, buoyed on sediment-charged (denser) lakewater, may have kept the lake surface cold in summer. Other factors such as wind-shifted pollen deposition and possible effects from the Younger Dryas North Atlantic cooling could have contributed to the Great Lakes climatic reversal, but further studies are needed to resolve their relative significance.																			0930-7575					JAN	1992	6	3-4					241	250		10.1007/BF00193537	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00193537													WOS:000207079600015

The Congo basin appears to be an important wintering area for these birds that are dispersed widely but thinly throughout the large network of rivers. Clearly, difficulties in performing fieldwork in the basin have, thus far, left this wintering area unrecognized. We suggest that the main wintering area for L. f fuscus covers an area from the Rift Valley lakes westward into the Congo basin and, contrary to the mainstream literature, only a small proportion of the population winter on the East African coast.

Alewife mortality, condition, and immune response to prolonged cold temperatures	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Alewife, Alosa pseudoharengus, have been recognized for several decades as one of the most important forage fish in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Although massive alewife die-offs have regularly been observed throughout the Great Lakes and other inland lakes, little substantive information is available regarding physiological mechanisms associated with adult alewife mortality. Long-term field surveys have shown a correlation between cold winter temperatures, poor condition and adult alewife mortality. In this study, adult alewife were raised in replicate pond systems and subjected to contrasting cold temperatures (4 and < 2 degrees C) representing mild and severe winter conditions. We evaluated alewife mortality, condition and immune response, to these temperatures. In contrast to our expectations, alewife exposed to mild and severe winter temperatures showed no difference in mortality or condition (measured as the ratio of dry to wet weight). Survival of alewife held in ponds with mild winter conditions (similar to 4 degrees C) was similar to that of alewife exposed to prolonged periods (more than six weeks) of temperatures < 2 degrees C. This result contrasts with previous observations indicating that alewife cannot tolerate temperatures < 3 degrees C. Circulating lymphocytes from alewife exposed to severe winter temperatures were significantly lower in number (similar to 40%) compared to fish experiencing milder winter conditions, suggesting sub-lethal immunosuppression in response to the colder winter temperatures. Although colder winter temperatures did not directly induce alewife mortality, these results suggest that winter conditions that result in colder water temperatures can produce immunosuppression, thereby increasing alewife susceptibility to disease and mortality.																			0380-1330					MAR	2008	34	1					134	142		10.3394/0380-1330(2008)34[134:AMCAIR]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2008)34[134:AMCAIR]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000255209400011

By introducing a new approach to separately evaluate the rates of organic and clastic sediment input, we demonstrated that the peat began to form when the fluvial sedimentation rate was significantly decreased (less than 0.6 mm/yr), while plant macrofossil analysis suggested that lowering of water level is also important to the peat initiation. Such changes in sedimentary environment may be associated with the abrupt abandonment of crevasse splays. The concentrated ages of the peat initiation around 5600-5000, 4600-4300, and 4100-3600 cal. BP suggest that an allogenic control promoted the abandonment of crevasse splays, and different onset ages can be explained by different fluvial responses of the Ishikari River and its tributaries. The abandonment of crevasse splays could result from sea-level fall or decreased precipitation. While submillennial sea-level fluctuations coincident with the peat initiation have not been reported in coastal lowlands of Japan, the close comparison of the onset ages and decreased precipitation recorded in a stalagmite from China, which represents the strength of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), suggests that decrease in precipitation led to the abandonment of crevasse splays. Our results may indicate that similar fluvial responses might be common in other coastal floodplains affected by the EASM.

J	Wojtal, AZ; Witkowski, A; Scharf, B				Wojtal, Agata Z.; Witkowski, Andrzej; Scharf, Burkhard			An approach to the recent environmental history of Pilica Piaski spring (southern Poland) using diatoms	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Diatom floras from springs have received little attention until recently, despite the fact that springs provide specific conditions that cannot be found in any other aquatic system, and remain of great importance in terms of general environmental changes. Due to pollution of the Krakow-CzA (TM) stochowska upland aquifers, the chemical composition of spring waters in the area is anthropogenically modified, and far from the natural state. In order to generate a baseline diatom flora for springs, a paleolimnological study was applied as one of the best recognized and applied methods used to track long-term environmental changes worldwide. Little is known, however, about the direction and nature of such changes in aquatic environments fed by springs. The present article focuses on shifts in diatom assemblages preserved in sediments collected from a small pond, situated close to several spring outlets. They were interpreted as a record of environmental changes that had taken place during the last century. For most of the history of the pond-as recorded in this 84 cm long core-the diatom assemblage was dominated by small Fragilaria spp. The major shifts in species composition began in a core depth of 65 cm with a decline in Fragilaria construens var. venter (Ehrenberg) Grunow and Fragilaria pinnata Ehrenberg complexes, and a concurrent increase in Achnanthidium minutissimum (Kutzing) Czarnecki. The second change was recorded at the depth of 45 cm with a sharp decline of A. minutissimum, which again was replaced by the small Fragilaria spp. In recent years, further changes in the diatom assemblage occurred, with a notable increase in Cyclotella delicatula Hustedt. The assemblage shifts recorded at this site appear to be consistent with environmental changes triggered by land use (e.g. agriculture intensity) and/or possible changes in spring water discharge.					; Wojtal, Agata/J-2829-2012	Witkowski, Andrzej/0000-0003-1714-218X; Wojtal, Agata Z./0000-0002-5233-2205; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2009	631	1					267	277		10.1007/s10750-009-9815-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-9815-8													WOS:000267040900016
J	Marks, J; Piburn, J; Tootle, G; Kerr, G; Oubeidillah, A				Marks, Jeffrey; Piburn, Jesse; Tootle, Glenn; Kerr, Greg; Oubeidillah, Abdoul			Estimates of Glacier Mass Loss and Contribution to Streamflow in the Wind River Range in Wyoming: Case Study	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												The Wind River Range is a continuous mountain range, approximately 160 km in length, in west-central Wyoming. The presence of glaciers results in meltwater contributions to streamflow during the late summer (July, August, and September: JAS) when snowmelt is decreasing; temperatures are high; precipitation is low; evaporation rates are high; and municipal, industrial, and irrigation water are at peak demands. Thus, the quantification of glacier meltwater (e.g., volume and mass) contributions to late summer/early fall streamflow is important, given that this resource is dwindling owing to glacier recession. The current research expands upon previous research efforts and identifies two glaciated watersheds, one on the east slope (Bull Lake Creek) and one on the west slope (Green River) of the Wind River Range, in which unimpaired streamflow is available from 1966 to 2006. Glaciers were delineated within each watershed and area estimates (with error) were obtained for the years 1966, 1989, and 2006. Glacier volume (mass) loss (with error) was estimated by using empirically based volume-area scaling relationships. For 1966 to 2006, glacier mass contributions to JAS streamflow on the east slope were approximately 8%, whereas those on the west slope were approximately 2%. The volume-area scaling glacier mass estimates compared favorably with measured (stereo pair remote sensed data) estimates of glacier mass change for three glaciers (Teton, Middle Teton, and Teepe) in the nearby Teton Range and one glacier (Dinwoody) in the Wind River Range.

The Fenhe reservoir began to supply raw water to the drinking water treatment plant of the City of Taiyuan, China in 2004. The surface of the reservoir froze in winter, and the lower-layer water above the reservoir bed became anoxic because of oxygen consumption by the sediments. Hence, ammonia-nitrogen released from the sediments and trapped in the lower-layer water. After the ice surface thawed in spring, the ammonia-nitrogen in the deepwater was brought up owing to the wind-wave mixing processes. Thus the concentration of ammonia-nitrogen in the outlet water exceeded the permitted level, and the water supply from the Fenhe reservoir had to be cut off. To solve the problem, the Water-lifting Aerator system was installed in the reservoir in the winter of 2005, the dissolved oxygen concentration in the lower-layer water has been maintained at more than 3 mg/L and the ammonia-nitrogen concentration has been reduced to less than 0.1 mg/L. The ammonia-nitrogen concentration in the outlet water is a 95% reduction compared to the same period of last year before the system installation. Since then the water supply from the Fenhe reservoir has no longer been interrupted. Compared with traditional water treatment technology to remove ammonia-nitrogen, the new technology saves energy for 77%. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Free-living northern bobwhites (n = 62) on the Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge (near Eagle Lake, Texas, USA) were examined during spring and fall 1993 for helminthic endoparasites and specific antibodies against the infectious agents responsible for nine infectious diseases. Trichostrongylus cramae, Raillietina sp., and Strongyloides avium were collected from 97, 44, and 32% of northern bobwhites examined, respectively. Dispharynx nasuta and Syngamus trachea also were found. No gross lesions due to parasites were observed. Specific antibody to Pasteurella multocida was found in 3 of 53 plasma samples. It is possible that potentially pathogenic species such as P. multocida, T. cramae, and D. nasuta could threaten sympatric Attwater's prairie chickens.					; Peterson, Markus/C-3303-2008	Peterson, Markus/0000-0001-6145-0134; 													0090-3558					APR	1998	34	2					348	354		10.7589/0090-3558-34.2.348	http://dx.doi.org/10.7589/0090-3558-34.2.348								9577783					WOS:000073228900016

Reactivation of a cryptobiotic stream ecosystem in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica: A long-term geomorphological experiment	GEOMORPHOLOGY					26th Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium on Geomorphology and Ecosystems	2005	Buffalo, NY					The McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica contain many glacial meltwater streams that flow for 6 to 12 weeks during the austral summer and link the glaciers to the lakes on the valley floors. Dry valley streams gain solutes longitudinally through weathering reactions and microbial processes occurring in the hyporheic zone. Some streams have thriving cyanobacterial mats. In streams with regular summer flow, the mats are freeze-dried through the winter and begin photosynthesizing with the onset of flow. To evaluate the longer term persistence of cyanobacterial mats, we diverted flow to an abandoned channel, which had not received substantial flow for approximately two decades. Monitoring of specific conductance showed that for the first 3 years after the diversion, the solute concentrations were greater in the reactivated channel than in most other dry valley streams. We observed that cyanobacterial mats became abundant in the reactivated channel within a week, indicating that the mats had been preserved in a cryptobiotic state in the channel. Over the next several years, these mats had high rates of productivity and nitrogen fixation compared to mats from other streams. Experiments in which mats from the reactivated channel and another stream were incubated in water from both of the streams indicated that the greater solute concentrations in the reactivated channel stimulated net primary productivity of mats from both streams. These stream-scale experimental results indicate that the cryptobiotic preservation of cyanobacterial mats in abandoned channels in the dry valleys allows for rapid response of these stream ecosystems to climatic and geomorphological change, similar to other and zone stream ecosystems.

However, the response of soil moisture content (SMC) anomalies during summer on the Loess Plateau to large-scale teleconnection remains unclear. Here, using the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) method, this study extracted a homogenized area with significant variability of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (p<0.01), which was called sensitive areas for vegetation restoration (SAVR) of the Loess Plateau. Based on 1 km daily soil moisture dataset named SMCI1.0 at top 1 m, we demonstrated that there was an interannual fluctuation of summer SMC from 2000 to 2020 over the SAVR of the Loess Plateau. Spatially, SMC during summer in the SAVR of the Loess Plateau exhibited an enhanced regional difference characterized by 'dry to drier and wet to wetter'. Importantly, abnormal SMC during summer in the SAVR of the Loess Plateau can been attributed to distinct circulation pattern and anomalous water vapor transport, which showed asymmetrical distributions between positive and negative anomalous years of summer SMC. Due to the activities of western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) and lowpressure system around the Lake Baikal (an anomalous anticyclone prevailed over the western north Pacific), the positive (negative) anomalous years of summer SMC witnessed net water vapor influx (outflux) anomalies to the Loess Plateau compared to the climatology, corresponding to anomalous upward (sinking) motions, further leading to more (less) SMC in summer over the SAVR of the Loess Plateau, respectively. The conclusions of this study have implications for excavating early warning information of SMC anomalies and natural restoration sustainable management on the Loess Plateau.					li, shuang shuang/N-6228-2014	li, shuang shuang/0000-0003-2702-1293													0168-1923	1873-2240				JUN 1	2024	352								110046	10.1016/j.agrformet.2024.110046	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2024.110046		MAY 2024											WOS:001241570200001

In this study, the water circulation and mixing processes occurring in the shallow, subtropical Tingalpa Reservoir in Australia have been investigated. Bathymetrical, meteorological, chemical and physical data collected from field measurements, laboratory analysis of water sampling and an in-situ Vertical Profile System (VPS) were analysed. Based on the high-frequency VPS dataset, a 1D model was developed to provide information for vertical transport and mixing processes. The results show that persistent high air temperature and stable reservoir water depth lead to a prolonged thermal stratification. Analysis indicates that heavy rainfalls have a significant impact on water quality when the dam level is low. The peak value of Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) concentration occurred in the wet season, while the specific UV absorbance (SUVA) value decreased when solar radiation increased from spring to summer. The study aims to provide a comprehensive approach for understanding and modelling the water mixing processes in similar lakes with high-frequency data from VPS's or other monitoring systems.

Aerosol-weakened summer monsoons decrease lake fertilization on the Chinese Loess Plateau	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE												Anthropogenic aerosol increases over the past few decades have weakened the Asian summer monsoon(1-3) with potentially far-reaching socio-economic and ecological repercussions. However, it is unknown how these changes will affect freshwater ecosystems that are important to densely populated regions of Asia. High-resolution diatom records and other proxy data archived in lake sediment cores from the Chinese Loess Plateau allow the comparison of summer monsoon intensity, lake trophic status and aquatic ecosystem responses during warming periods over the past two millennia. Here we show that an abrupt shift towards eutrophic limnological conditions coincided with historical warming episodes(4,5), marked by increased wind intensity and summer monsoon rainfall leading to phosphorus-laden soil erosion and natural lake fertilization. In contrast, aerosol-affected Anthropocene warming catalysed a marked weakening in summer monsoon intensity leading to decreases in soil erosion and lake mixing. The recent warm period triggered a strikingly different aquatic ecosystem response with a limnological regime shift marked by turnover in diatom species composition now dominated by oligotrophic taxa, consistent with reductions in nutrient fertilization, reduced ice cover and increased thermal stratification(6). Anthropogenic aerosols have altered climate-monsoon dynamics that are unparalleled in the past similar to 2,000 years, ushering in a new ecological state.

The species has been considered extinct in the Rhine since the 1940s; however, a successful re-introduction programme re-established a self-reproducing population. Telemetry data of adult NSH (NEDAP TRAIL System((R))) were used for a first description of the timing of spawning migrations of NSH in winter, but also suggested that the River IJssel, a lower branch of the Rhine, may serve as spawning ground. This was further proven in spring 2010 with drift net catches of 218 freshly hatched NSH larvae sampled directly upstream from Kampen, where the IJssel discharges into Lake IJsselmeer. These larvae did not differ between controls from a hatchery that were about 12h of age, indicating that the drifting larvae of NSH must have hatched in upstream areas of the River IJssel.

Autumn-winter anomalous variations in bottom water and sediment temperatures in Lake Teletskoe	RUSSIAN GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												We discuss the results of bottom temperature monitoring run in October through December 2005 in the deepwater basin of Lake Teletskoe at a take depth of 320 in using an autonomous recorder. The obtained temperature patterns of water and sediments to a depth of similar to 1.4 m show sudden large changes. Bottom water temperature fluctuated between 2.9 and 4 degrees C, and the sediment geothermal gradient changed from -360 to +170 mK/m for the period of measurements. Water temperature became 0.6 degrees C warmer through November and suddenly switched to cooling after 5 December, and the drop reached 1.15 degrees C for the following 22 days. The change in water temperature caused the respective change in sediments, namely, gave rise to a positive geothermal gradient. Estimating the deep component of geothermal gradient (heat flow) with this climate noise requires a longer experiment of more than one year. (c) 2007, IGM, Siberian Branch of the RAS.

Development and analysis of spring plant phenology products: 36 years of 1-km grids over the conterminous US	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Time series of phenological products provide information on the timings of recurrent biological events and on their temporal trends. This information is key to studying the impacts of climate change on our planet as well as for managing natural resources and agricultural production. Here we develop and analyze new long term phenological products: 1 km grids of the Extended Spring Indices (SI-x) over the conterminous United States from 1980 to 2015. These new products (based on Daymet daily temperature grids and created by using cloud computing) allow the analysis of two primary variables (first leaf and first bloom) and two derivative products (Damage Index and Last Freeze Day) at a much finer spatial resolution than previous gridded or interpolated products. Furthermore, our products provide enough temporal depth to reliably analyze trends and changes in the timing of spring arrival at continental scales. Validation results confirm that our products largely agree with lilac and honeysuckle leaf and flowering onset observations. The spatial analysis shows a significantly delayed spring onset in the northern US whereas in the western and the Great Lakes region, spring onset advances. The mean temporal variabilities of the indices were analyzed for the nine major climatic regions of the US and results showed a clear division into three main groups: early, average and late spring onset. Finally, the region belonging to each group was mapped. These examples show the potential of our four phenological products to improve understanding of the responses of ecosystems to a changing climate.

J	SNYDER, CD; HENDRICKS, AC				SNYDER, CD; HENDRICKS, AC			EFFECT OF SEASONALLY CHANGING FEEDING-HABITS ON WHOLE-ANIMAL MERCURY CONCENTRATIONS IN HYDROPSYCHE MOROSA (TRICHOPTERA, HYDROPSYCHIDAE)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Food habits, net-spinning activity, and whole-animal mercury concentrations in Hydropsyche morosa Hagan were examined monthly over a one year period on the South River, Virginia. Gut content analysis revealed seasonal patterns in the consumption of food that was correlated with net-spinning activity. Between April and October, when feeding nets were widespread, detritus represented between 72 and 94% of the total volume of food material found in the guts, while algae represented less than 18%. However, between November and March, when feeding nets were rare or absent, the relative contribution of each of the three food types (i.e., detritus, algae, and animal) changed significantly. Detritus declined to between 51 and 60%, and algae increased to between 39 and 47% of the total food volume. Whole-animal mercury concentrations ranged from 0.14 to 1.20 mu g g(-1) and were significantly higher in the summer. Seasonal differences were not related to environmental mercury levels and only weakly related to body size. In contrast, whole-animal mercury levels were strongly related to seasonal changes in diet. In summer, when H. morosa larvae were filtering highly contaminated seston, whole-animal mercury levels were high. Conversely, in winter, when larvae were grazing less contaminated algae, whole-animal mercury levels were significantly lower. The primary component of seston was detritus (>81%) throughout the year. Therefore, the high mercury concentration in seston was probably associated with detritus. As a result, a significant relationship was observed between whole-animal mercury concentration and the relative amount of detritus consumed. These patterns indicate that in streams with highly productive hydropsychid populations, the rate of processing of mercury and other heavy metals may be related to seasonal changes in feeding behavior.																			0018-8158					MAR 10	1995	299	2					115	123		10.1007/BF00017563	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00017563													WOS:A1995QU04600003

However, their interpretations have been controversial. In this study, based on the observed and simulated data (isoGSM2) on oxygen isotope composition of precipitation, the linkage between summer precipitation (P) and delta O-18(p) in the Dongting Lake basin and their possible influencing factors were investigated. The results indicate that the interannual variation of summer delta O-18(p) is consistent with that of annual delta O-18(p). They both show a significantly negative correlation with the summer P, suggesting that the stable isotope composition in precipitation may be considered as a proxy of summer precipitation in the Dongting Lake basin. Statistically, the amount effect and circulation effect are significant in the isotope composition of precipitation in the basin. Based on either the observed data in Changsha or the simulated data for the basin, the local amount effect appears more important than large-scale circulation for delta O-18(p) during extreme summers. These results can potentially improve the reconstruction of paleoclimate in the East Asian monsoon region. Further study is needed to determine the contribution of local and large-scale factors to the oxygen isotope composition of precipitation and to quantify the integral rainout along the moisture transporting paths.					; Guan, Huade/E-9262-2015; Rao, Zhiguo/L-5118-2019	Liu, Zhongli/0000-0002-6474-870X; He, Xinguang/0000-0002-7570-3224; Guan, Huade/0000-0001-5425-6974; 													0899-8418	1097-0088				JUN 30	2023	43	8					3590	3604		10.1002/joc.8047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.8047		MAR 2023											WOS:000942425100001

Increased emissions of PCBs into the urban-industrial atmosphere leads to enhanced depositional fluxes to proximate waters. In this study, the increased air-water exchange inputs of PCB congeners into southern Lake Michigan driven by elevated atmospheric concentrations emanating from the Chicago, IL/Gary, IN air plume was studied. Intensive experiments were conducted in May and July 1994 and January 1995. The gaseous Sigma PCB concentrations at the overlake site 15-km from Chicago ranged from 132 to 1120 pg/m(3) with higher concentrations occurring in warm periods and when winds were from southerly and westerly quadrants. Dissolved phase Sigma PCB concentrations ranged from 48 to 302 pg/L with concentrations in winter similar to 2.5 x higher than summer concentrations. Instantaneous net air-water exchange fluxes ranged from -32 (absorption) to + 59 ng/m(2)-d with absorptive flux highest in summer when winds were from the urban area and gas-phase concentrations were highest. Air and surface water temperatures and wind direction were the dominant factors influencing the magnitude and direction of air-water exchange fluxes. The modeled net air-water exchange flux of Sigma PCB in the southern quarter of Lake Michigan was -18 ug/m(2)-yr (net absorption) in 1994, corresponding to 140 kg/yr net input.

The isolate was shown to be an obligate anaerobe oxidizing CO, and producing equimolar quantities of H-2 and CO2 according to the equation CO + H2O -> CO2 + H-2. No organic substrates were used as energy sources. For lithotrophic growth on CO, 0(.)2 g acetate or yeast extract l(-1) was required but did not support growth in the absence of CO. Growth was observed in the temperature range 37-68 degrees C, the optimum being 55 degrees C. The pH range for growth was 6(.)7-9(.)5, the optimum pH being 8(.)0. The generation time under optimal conditions was 1(.)3 h. The DNA G + C content was 45 mol%. Penicillin, erythromycin, streptomycin, rifampicin, vancomycin and tetracycline completely inhibited both growth and CO utilization by strain 2204(T). Thus, isolate 2204(T) was found to be the first known moderately thermophilic: and alkalitolerant H-2-producing anaerobic carboxydotroph. The novel bacterium fell within the cluster of the family Peptococcaceae within the low-G + C-content Gram-positive bacteria, where it formed a separate branch. On the basis of morphological, physiological and phylogenetic features, strain 2204(T) should be assigned to a novel genus and species, for which the name Thermincola carboxydiphila gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is strain 2204(T) (=DSM 17129(T) =VKM B-2283(T)=JCM 13258(T)).

No changes were detected following division into an acidified basin (A) and reference basin (B) in 1989. Acidification was initiated in autumn 1990. During the summer of 1991, there was a normal development of zooplankton in the B-basin, while an initial increase and subsequent collapse of the dominant crustacean Holopedium occurred in the A-basin. Here, total zooplankton biomass dropped from a July maximum of 72 mu g C L(-1) to a September minimum of less than 4 mu g C L(-1). Holopedium remained dominant in the B-basin, while it was absent from the A-basin during the following years. The zooplankton perturbations occurred in spite of marginal changes in pH and Al-concentrations. Survival tests did not reveal any acute toxicity of the acidified water, nor did climatic variables offer any explanation for the zooplankton changes. There were pronounced oscillations in phytoplankton biomass and species composition. Measured grazing rates indicated that these oscillations were not caused by macrozooplankton grazing, while disappearance of key phytoplankton species, notably Oocystis, apparently contributed to the zooplankton decline.

In addition, quantifying the climate change contribution to cyanobacterial blooms is difficult, further complicating efforts to set nutrient reduction goals for mitigating blooms in freshwater lakes. This study employed a continuous variable Bayesian modeling framework to develop a model to predict spring cyanobacterial bloom areas and frequencies (the responses) using nutrient levels and climatic factors as predictors. Our results suggested that both spring climatic factors (e.g., increasing temperature and decreasing wind speed) and nutrients (e.g., total phosphorus) played vital roles in spring blooms in Lake Taihu, with climatic factors being the primary drivers for both bloom areas and frequencies. Climate change in spring had a 90% probability of increasing the bloom area from 35 km(2) to 180 km(2) during our study period, while nutrient reduction limited the bloom area to 170 km(2), which helped mitigate expansion of cyanobacterial blooms. For lake management, to ensure a 90% probability of the mean spring bloom areas remaining under 154 km(2) (the 75th percentile of the bloom areas in spring), the total phosphorus should be maintained below 0.073 mg center dot L-1 under current climatic conditions, which is a 46.3% reduction from the current level. Our modeling approach is an effective method for deriving dynamic nutrient thresholds for lake management under different climatic scenarios and management goals.

THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Meteorological trend analysis is a useful tool for understanding climate change and can provide useful information on the possibility of future change. Lake Dianchi is the sixth largest freshwater body in China with serious eutrophication. Algal blooms outbreak was proven to be closely associated with some climatic factors in Lake Dianchi. It is therefore essential to explore the trends of climatic time series to understand the mechanism of climate change on lake eutrophication. We proposed an integrated method of Mann-Kendall (MK) test, seasonal-trend decomposition using locally weighted regression (LOESS) (STL), and regime shift index (RSI) to decompose the trend analysis and identify the stable and abrupt changes of some climate variables from 1951 to 2009. The variables include mean air temperature (Tm), maximum air temperatures (Tmax), minimum air temperatures (Tmin), precipitation (Prec), average relative humidity (Hum), and average wind speed (Wind). The results showed that (a) annual Tm, Tmax, and Tmin have a significant increasing trend with the increasing rates of 0.26, 0.15and 0.43 A degrees C per decade, respectively; (b) annual precipitation has an insignificant decreasing trend with the decreasing rate of 3.17 mm per decade; (c) annual Hum has a significant decreasing trend in all seasons; and (d) there are two turning points for temperature rise around 1980 and 1995 and two abrupt change periods for precipitation with the extreme points appearing in 1963 and 1976. Temperature rise and precipitation decline in summer and autumn as well as wind speed decrease after the 1990s may be an important reason for algal blooms outbreak in Lake Dianchi. This study was expected to provide foundation and reference for regional water resource management.					; Zhao, Lei/F-4258-2018; Liu, Yong/B-1826-2008; Liang, Zhongyao/ABI-8382-2020; liu, yong/AAD-1467-2019	Liang, Zhongyao/0000-0001-7695-5223; Liu, Yong/0000-0001-8181-1080; 													0177-798X	1434-4483				JAN	2015	119	1-2					181	191		10.1007/s00704-014-1098-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-014-1098-y													WOS:000347409100015

Late Pleistocene-Holocene rise and collapse of Lake Suguta, northern Kenya Rift	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Late Pleistocene to Middle Holocene African Humid Period (AHP) was characterized by dramatic hydrologic fluctuations in the tropics. A better knowledge of the timing, spatial extent, and magnitude of these hydrological fluctuations is essential to decipher the climate-forcing mechanisms that controlled them. The Suguta Valley (2 degrees N, northern Kenya Rift) has recorded extreme environmental changes during the AHP. Extensive outcrops of lacustrine sediments, ubiquitous wave-cut notches, shorelines, and broad terrace treads along the valley margins are the vestiges of Lake Suguta, which once filled an 80 km long and 20 km wide volcano-tectonic depression. Lake Suguta was deep between 16.5 and 8.5 cal ka BR During its maximum highstand, it attained a water depth of ca 300 m, a surface area of ca 2150 km(2), and a volume of ca 390 km(3). The spatial distribution of lake sediments, the elevation of palaeo-shorelines, and other geomorphic evidences suggest that palaeo-Lake Suguta had an overflow towards the Turkana basin to the north. After 8.5 cal ka BP, Lake Suguta abruptly disappeared. A comparison of the Lake Suguta water-level curve with other reconstructed water levels from the northern part of the East African Rift System shows that local insolation, which is dominated by precessional cycles, may have controlled the timing of lake highstands in this region. Our data show that changes of lake levels close to the Equator seem to be driven by fluctuations of spring insolation, while fluctuations north of the Equator are apparently related to variations in summer insolation. However, since these inferred timings of lake-level changes are mostly based on the radiocarbon dating of carbonate shells, which may have been affected by a local age reservoir, alternative dating methods are needed to support this regional synthesis. Between 12.7 and 11.8 cal ka BP, approximately during the Northern Hemisphere high-latitude Younger Dryas, the water level of Lake Suguta fell by ca 50 m, suggesting that remote influences also affected local hydrology.

The Salt Marsh (Sabkha) in the Western Part of Libya	SABKHA ECOSYSTEMS: AFRICA AND SOUTHERN EUROPE, VOL III	Tasks for Vegetation Science											The total coastline of Libya is about 1975 km long. Numerous salt marshes bordered by sabkhas occur along the coast. These sabkhas cover some a very large area on the coast line and most of them are completely dry during the summer season. One of the larger sabkhas is located in the western part of Libya and is called "the Abu Kammash salt marsh (Abu Kammash subkha)" and it is found along the coastal Libyan-Tunisian highway about 150 km west of Tripoli in the Abu Kammash area near the Tunisian border, at an altitude of 2.5-4.0 m below sea level. This is a typical salt marsh of coastal Mediterranean region. It is generally a flat sabkha with a total area of about 50 km(2). There are 38 wells in the sabkha, from which brine water is pumped through pipelines to Abu Kammash factory (chemical plant) which was established on the area near the seashore for the mass production of pure salt and bleaching agents. The saline ponds and pools are formed when such low land area floods in rainy winters, and 12 km long and 4 km wide small seasonal lake is formed. In summer, however, most of these lakes dry up. The high salinity and evaporation lead to precipitation of a thick layer of salt on the sabkha floor. The phytoplankton density is quite low. The sabkha has been identified as a natural biotope for brine shrimp (Artemia). Next to the Artemia comes the birds which are also found in moderate number. Majority of the birds are migratory, as such the sabkha may serve as good refuge for such birds provided certain measures are taken. There is a very poor vegetation cover composed mainly of halophytes and desert plant taxa around the sabkha due to coarse sand texture and prevailing semiarid conditions.																			0167-9406		978-90-481-9672-2				2011	46						79	84		10.1007/978-90-481-9673-9_9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-9673-9_9													WOS:000286165300009

Survival of L223 embryos was not significantly correlated to lake pH during experimental acidification. Also, embryo mortality in L223 was not significantly different from that of lake trout embryos in two reference lakes, L224 and L468. Survival of L223 embryos was not improved when they were incubated in nonacidified lakes. Embryo mortality was highest in all lakes (33-81%) within 15 d of fertilization. Mortality was negligible from Day 15 until the termination of the seasonal observations. (Day 120 or 150). High variability in embryo survival existed between individual females within a single lake. The mean size of eggs from L223 lake trout decreased significantly from 1979 to 1982. Recruitment failures occurred in L223 from 1980 to 1982. We hypothesize that lake trout recruitment failure in L223 occurred between the posthatching period (spring) and actual recruitment into the population as young-of-the-year (fall) and that embryo mortality in this lake was not critical to population recruitment.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				FEB	1990	47	2					236	243		10.1139/f90-026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f90-026													WOS:A1990CN64400001

The experiments revealed that grazing pressure on phytoplankton was highly dependent on zooplankton species composition. Smaller phytoplankton species such as Stephanodiscus carconensis were more grazed when D. galeata was abundant, whereas large colonial diatom species such as Aulacoseira granulata were preferentially grazed when E. japonicus dominated. In addition, indirect effect of macrozooplankton through nutrient regeneration was suggested, although the magnitude of nutrient regeneration effects seemed to differ between D. galeata and E. japonicus. Specifically, growth rates of Sphaerocystis schroeteri were stimulated more by E. japonicus than by D. galeata. Macrozooplankton also enhanced the growth rates of colonial cyanobacteria such as Microcystis incerta, probably through decreasing the density of microzooplankton grazers (ciliates and rotifers). The results suggest that the effects of large zooplankton on phytoplankton populations are species-specific and cannot be understood without consideration of changes in abundance of other components of plankton communities.

Unusually thick freshwater ice and its impacts on aquatic resources in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A) during the winter of 2020-2021	ARCTIC SCIENCE												Despite a long-term thinning trend in freshwater ice in northern Alaska, cold low-snow cover winters can still emerge to grow thick ice. In 2021, we observed abnormally thick ice by winter's end on lakes and rivers throughout the Fish Creek Watershed in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. This recent and anomalous winter presented an opportunity to assess how such conditions, more typical of many decades previous, affected aquatic habitat and winter water supply. Observed maximum ice thickness in 2021 of 1.9 m closely matched low-snow ice growth simulations, whereas previous records averaged 1.5 m and more closely matched high-snow ice growth simulations. The resulting extent of bedfast lake ice from late winter synthetic aperture radar (SAR) analysis in 2021 was the highest on record since 1992. This SAR analysis suggests a 33% reduction in liquid water below ice by lake surface area compared with the recent thin-ice winter of 2018 (1.2 m). Together, these results help place the cold, low-snow winter of 2020-2021 in context of the long-term trend toward warmer, snowier winters that appear to becoming more common in Arctic Alaska.

Spring Viremia of Carp Virus (SVCV): Global Status of Outbreaks, Diagnosis, Surveillance, and Research	ISRAELI JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE-BAMIDGEH					International Workshop on Emerging Fish Diseases in Asia	DEC 06-07, 2007	Bangkok, THAILAND	Se Asian Fisheries Dev Ctr, Aquaculture Dept				The spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) is an OIE-listed rhabodovirus historically responsible for losses of cultured fish in Europe. Acute disease is associated with high mortality, especially in common carp Cyprinus carpio during their first spring season when water temperatures are 10-15 degrees C. Mortality has been reported in other cyprinids and in the Wels caff ish Siluris glanis. The disease is characterized by hemorrhages on the skin and bloody mucus in the intestine, clinical signs shared by other diseases including bacterial infections. In 2002, SVCV was detected on a large koi farm in the USA. The USA isolate was 98% identical to isolates associated with koi and goldfish imported from China, but distantly related to European strains. In spring 2002, a major SVCV kill of common carp occurred in Cedar Lake, Wisconsin. This isolate was also of the Asian type, as were subsequent isolates from wild and cultured fish in several states. In the USA, all infected farmed populations were destroyed and no additional isolates have been detected since 2004. One of the most critical aspects of SVCV diagnosis is to differentiate the disease from the koi herpesvirus (KHV). The most obvious difference is that KHV generally occurs in temperatures of 20-28 degrees C while SVCV disease occurs below 18 degrees C and commonly at 10-15 degrees C.																			0792-156X					SEP	2009	61	3					180	187																WOS:000271304400005

Response of a hydrothermal system to escalating phreatic unrest: the case of Turrialba and Irazu in Costa Rica (2007-2012)	EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE												This study presents the first hydrogeochemical model of the hydrothermal systems of Turrialba and Irazu volcanoes in central Costa Rica, manifested as thermal springs, summit crater lakes, and fumarolic degassing at both volcanoes. Our period of observations (2007-2012) coincides with the pre- and early syn-phreatic eruption stages of Turrialba volcano that resumed volcanic unrest since 2004, after almost 140 years of quiescence. Peculiarly, the generally stable Irazu crater lake dropped its level during this reawakening of Turrialba. The isotopic composition of discharged fluids reveals the Caribbean meteoric origin; a contribution of "andesitic water" for Turrialba fumaroles up to similar to 50% is suggested. Four groups of thermal springs drain the northern flanks of Turrialba and Irazu volcanoes into two main rivers. Rio Sucio (i.e. "dirty river") is a major rock remover on the North flank of Irazu, mainly fed by the San Cayetano spring group. Instead, one group of thermal springs discharges towards the south of Irazu. All thermal spring waters are of SO4-type (i.e. steam heated waters), although none of the springs has a common hydrothermal end-member. A water mass budget for thermal springs results in an estimated total output flux of 187 +/- 37 L/s, with 100 +/- 20 L/s accounted for by the San Cayetano springs. Thermal energy release is estimated at 110 +/- 22 MW (83.9 +/- 16.8 MW by San Cayetano), whereas the total rock mass removal rate by chemical leaching is similar to 3,000 m(3)/y (similar to 2,400 m(3)/y by San Cayetano-Rio Sucio). Despite Irazu being the currently less active volcano, it is a highly efficient rock remover, which, on the long term can have effects on the stability of the volcanic edifice with potentially hazardous consequences (e.g. flank collapse, phreatic eruptions). Moreover, the vapor output flux from the Turrialba fumaroles after the onset of phreatic eruptions on 5 January 2010 showed an increase of at least similar to 260 L/s above pre-eruptive background fumarolic vapor fluxes. This extra vapor loss implies that the drying of the summit hydrothermal system of Turrialba could tap deeper than previously thought, and could explain the coincidental disappearance of Irazu's crater lake in April 2010.					pecoraino, giovannella/LZF-2682-2025; Rouwet, Dmitri/ABC-5920-2020															1880-5981				JUL 12	2021	73	1							142	10.1186/s40623-021-01471-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40623-021-01471-8													WOS:000672439800001

Pollen, ostracode-inferred lake level, and high Sr/Ca ratios indicate that the early Holocene (10000 to 6500 cal yr BP) was drier than the late Holocene. Low delta O-18 values during this interval are interpreted as resulting from winter-dominated precipitation, characteristic of a Mediterranean climate. Increasing delta O-18 values after 6500 cal yr BP signal a gradual increase in spring rains, which are present today. A severe 600-yr drought occurred at ca. 5500 cal yr BP, shortly after the transition from pistachio-almond to oak forest. During the late Holocene, two milder droughts occurred at about 1500 and 500 cal yr BP. Within the resolution of the record, no drought is evident during the collapse of the Akkadian empire (4200-3900 cal yr BP). Rather, a decrease in delta O-18 values to early-Holocene levels may indicate the return to a Mediterranean precipitation regime. (c) 2006 University of Washington. All rights reserved.

Changes in Dynamics of Seismic Processes Around Enguri High Dam Reservoir Induced by Periodic Variation of Water Level	SYNCHRONIZATION AND TRIGGERING: FROM FRACTURE TO EARTHQUAKE PROCESSES - LABORATORY, FIELD ANALYSIS AND THEORIES	GeoPlanet-Earth and Planetary Sciences											The importance of elucidating the effects of small periodic influences on the behavior of complex systems is well acknowledged. In the present research, a possible impact of regular water level variations in large reservoir as an example of small external influence (comparing to tectonic forces) on the dynamics of local seismic activity was investigated. In general, large reservoirs located in the seismically active zones are often considered as a factor which quantitatively and qualitatively influences the earthquakes generation. It was many times reported that during impoundment or immediately after it (namely from several months to several years), both the number and the magnitude of earthquakes around reservoir significantly increased. These changes in earthquake generation are named the reservoir induced seismicity (RIS). After several years of regular seasonal load/upload of the reservoir, the seismicity essentially decreases down to the level when lesser earthquakes occur with lower magnitudes. To explain this decrease, the authors of the present paper recently proposed a model of phase synchronization of local seismic activity by the periodic variation of the water level - the reservoir-induced synchronization of seismicity (RISS). Generally speaking, RISS presumes a kind of control of local seismic activity by synchronizing small external periodic influence and hence an increase of the order in dynamics of regional seismic activity. To reveal these changes in dynamics of phase-synchronized seismic activity around a large reservoir, field seismic and water level variation data were analyzed in the present work. Data sets of laboratory stick-slip acoustic emission, under a weak influence imposed as a model of natural seismicity influenced by periodic water level variation, also were analyzed. The evidence is presented showing that an increase of the order in dynamics of daily occurrence, as well as temporal and energy distribution of earthquakes took place around Enguri high dam water reservoir (Western Georgia) during the periodic variation of the water level in the lake. It is shown that when the water level variation in a reservoir is close to periodic, monthly frequency of earthquake occurrence reveals two maximums: in spring and autumn. There is a clear asymmetry in the seismic response, possibly due to load/unload response ratio (LURR) effect; the maximal release of seismic energy is during loading, i.e., in the spring.																			2190-5193		978-3-642-12299-6				2010							273	286		10.1007/978-3-642-12300-9_16	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-12300-9_16	10.1007/978-3-642-12300-9												WOS:000283022500016

B. graeca faces deterministic and stochastic aspects of this environment. Growth and reproduction were studied for two populations, one being covered by the water almost throughout the year and the other not. B. graeca is a semelparous annual freshwater snail whose life expectancy decreased with increasing age. Maturity was attained 4 months earlier for the first population. Reproduction took place in spring. The majority of adults died after egg-laying. Growth rate was rapid during spring, and activity ceased during winter. B. graeca is a prosobranch snail whose short turnover time (77.9 and 84.3 days) was similar to that seen in freshwater pulmonate snails. Productivity was assessed in two ways, by a size frequency method and by using cumulative biomass. Observed values, for the two methods respectively, were for mean biomass 18.53 and 22.8 g dry body weight/m(2), for annual production (P) 86.81 and 88.38 g dry body weight/m(2) or 9.56 gC/m(2) year respectively, and for annual turnover ratio (P/(B) over bar) 4.68 and 3.87/year. Net reproductive rate R-o was 2.99 and per capita rate of increase (r(c)) was 0.091.

J	Chaika, C				Chaika, Christina			Analysis of the recovery data of the Great Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo ringed in the Russian Federation and on the territory of former Soviet states in 1939-2014	ARDEA												This study is based on recoveries of c. 86,850 Great Cormorants ringed in the Russian Federation during 1939-2014. Data were obtained from the Bird Ringing Centre of Russia. During 1939 to 2014 a total of 1667 Cormorant recoveries (1.9%) were added to the ringing database. The majority of the recoveries were made in the Caspian Sea, Azov Sea, Black Sea, Baltic Sea and in Kazakhstan inland waterbodies, including the Aral Sea (seven recoveries), Lake Alakol (46), Lake Balkhash (28), Kapchagay Reservoir (10) and Lake Zaysan (5). Non-breeding birds (assuming breeding at age > 3 years) comprised 89% of ring recoveries from 1939 to 1974, 95% from 1975 to 1990 and 100% from 1991 to 2014. This study is the first to describe the migration patterns for this species on a continental scale. From Kaliningrad in the west to Vladivostok in the east seven mega clusters of waterbodies and wetlands exist where Cormorants breed and were ringed. Although showing some overlap, birds belonging to a certain cluster were recovered in distinct wintering areas, often more than 2000 km from the breeding areas and separated by high mountain ranges. The general migration pattern is discussed for four geographic regions. The occurrence of east-west migration patterns is briefly discussed and deserves further study as well as the role of high mountain ridges possibly shaping the movements between summer and winter areas.

The spring-summer succession between Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Microcystis and its underlying mechanism were investigated from 2009 to 2012 in hypereutrophic Dianchi Lake in China. Regularly, A. flos-aquae grows rapidly and forms bloom in March at water temperatures around 15A degrees C, followed by Microcystis blooming around 18A degrees C in April. Since 2010, the pattern of succession has changed, featuring an increase of Microcystis but decrease of A. flos-aquae biovolume, leading to near disappearance of A. flos-aquae in 2012. Coincidently, there was a sharp increase of nitrogen concentration in 2010, going up to 5.67 mg/l in 2011, and a big increase in the mass ratio of TN to TP from 13.6 in 2009 to 21.1 in 2011. We hypothesized that temperature is the most influential factor governing the initiation of rapid growth and succession between A. flos-aquae and Microcystis, while increase of TN and/or ratio of TN to TP may trigger the decline and disappearance of A. flos-aquae, time of recruitment, and the population dynamics of Microcystis. Our findings are not only meaningful to the understanding of the cyanobacterial bloom mechanism but also to the management of shallow eutrophic lakes.					ma, haiyan/GWQ-7425-2022; ZHOU, Qichao/KGM-3385-2024	ZHOU, Qichao/0000-0002-4292-9817; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2016	765	1					1	13		10.1007/s10750-015-2392-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-015-2392-0													WOS:000366641200001

We here quantify, at the national level, total N and P runoff losses and the key factors controlling runoff in open-field vegetable systems in China, by summarizing data from 151 publications pertaining to 13 Chinese provinces using literature dating back to 1990. Rank analysis was employed to clarify the impact of N and P runoff losses in vegetable systems, and different strategies for controlling N and P entering into water bodies are being compared. Vegetable production systems have higher fertilizer inputs (264.3 kg N ha(-1), 101.0 kg P ha(-1)) compared with upland crop and rice cultivation. As a result, annual total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) losses via runoff from vegetable systems reached 16.5 kg ha(-1) and 3.45 kg ha(-1), respectively, and the N and P loss ratio for fruit vegetable systems reached 13.1% and 3.95% of the total fertilizer input, respectively. In the summer-autumn growing season, soil nutrient losses were the highest, accounting for 44% to 89% of the whole year. Redundancy analysis revealed that the most critical factor determining runoff losses was runoff volume. N and P runoff losses were also largely dependent on total soil N (TSN) and Olsen-P, respectively. Therefore, quantitative data for the national N and P runoff losses in vegetable production systems provide a scientific basis for an effective optimization of fertilizer applications.

Natural flow events influence the behaviour and movement patterns of eel-tailed catfish (Tandanus tandanus) in a subtropical Queensland river	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Understanding the movement ecology of freshwater fishes, and how these patterns are affected by flow, is important for identifying key threats to populations and predicting their response to management strategies. We used acoustic telemetry to investigate the day-to-day behaviour and movement patterns of eel-tailed catfish (Tandanus tandanus) and examine how their behaviour was affected by natural changes to the flow regime in a subtropical river. Movement patterns varied within the tagged population: 29% were sedentary, 64% undertook interpool movements and 7% undertook reach-scale movements. The mean maximum distance travelled was 0.75 km (+/- 0.33, s.e.) and the maximum distance travelled was 16.9 km downstream. Fish moved upstream and downstream between pools mostly at dawn and dusk, presumably to feed in riffles. Most interpool movements were undertaken during low-flow conditions (<0.2m s(-1) and <6.0 m(3) s(-1)). Generally, the population responded inconsistently to flow events; however, the greatest movement response was detected during the first post-winter flow. Although fish preferred to move on an event fall, several fish continued to move throughout the study reach under baseflow conditions. Management strategies protecting low-flow conditions that maintain connectivity between daytime refuges and riffles may be important for the species' conservation. The effective delivery of post-winter flow events, particularly in perennial systems, is likely to provide critical dispersal opportunities and aid long-term population viability.

WATER												Of significant scientific and public concern is the high toxicity, significant bioaccumulation, and magnified concentration within the food web of mercury (Hg). Hg content both dissolved and in suspended forms in water as well as in biomass of different hydrobiont taxa was studied in 18 saline lakes in Crimea from 2012 to 2021. The impact of different factors (salinity, seasonality, anthropogenic activities, geological background, etc.) was analyzed. The generalization of data for all lakes showed that the average concentration of Hg in dissolved form was 129 ng L-1, varying over a wide range. The content of Hg in total suspended substrates was an average of 151 ng L-1, and the total content of Hg in lake water averaged 291 ng L-1. Geological background and anthropogenic activities can determine the total Hg content in lakes. In most lakes, a significant positive correlation was noted between the concentration of one, two, or all three indicators of Hg content and the month of the year, with indicators increasing from winter through to autumn. When analyzing the entire data array, a significant positive correlation was found between the concentration of the suspended form of Hg and salinity; such correlation between the concentration of the dissolved form of Hg and salinity was absent. The highest average Hg concentrations in biomasses were noted in Artemia and were the lowest in plants. Geological background and human activity contribute to high Hg content in lakes. Hydrobionts can significantly influence the distribution and behavior of Hg, being an important factor of its cycle in the lakes.

TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL												The basis of the recreational use of the territory is primarily natural factors, as they are not only tourism-recreational resources, but also the conditions of recreational activities. For their rational use it is necessary to give a complex assessment. An example of it is the recreational-ecological assessment of water bodies of Tomsk District, which takes into account the suitability of water for the organization of therapeutic (beach) recreation and sports tourism. In addition, the studied territory is estimated by the supply of drinking water and the ecological condition of the water bodies. A favourable site for development of beach recreation is only the left bank of the Tom River near Takhtamyshevo Village. Other water bodies and their sites are rather favourable for beach recreation: the right bank of the Tom River higher than Tomsk; Peschanoe Lake; Tom River inflows (the Tugoyakovka, Basandayka, Ushayka, Kyrgyzka, Poros Rivers); Kirek Lake; Bogashevo Lake; Luchanovo Lake; Aksenovo Lakes; Kandinsky Reservoir. Larino and Staroe Lakes are bad for beach recreation, but they have good conditions for fishing. For sports tourism water objects are estimated depending on the type of boating. Water objects of Tomsk District (mainly, the Tom River and numerous lakes) are used for driving on snowmobiles (in the winter), on hydrocycles, motor boats and boats (in the summer). Boating and rafting on the rivers of Tomsk District (the Ushayka, Tugoyakovka, Basandayka, Kyrgyzka Rivers) are used mainly for trainings of athletes, competitions of school students and family rest. Due to the mineral structure and character of water discharge on the surface springs of Tomsk District often form hydrogeologically interesting formations: bowls (Talovskye Bowls, Sukhorechinskye and Berezovskye Bowls), terraces (the Zvezdny Spring). To provide the population of Tomsk Region with drinking water underground waters are used. The degree of extent of resources exploration of underground waters the low. The main problems of water objects condition in the territory of Tomsk District by the data of Tomsk CGMS are: quality of drinking waters and pollution of sources of drinking water supply; pollution of superficial water objects; condition of river courses and banks of water objects; marshiness of the territory of Tomsk District. Thus, amateur rest in unequipped territories on the banks of the Tom River and its inflows, and also on some lakes is mostly developed; which, in turn, affects negatively both the district and the region's economy, and sanitary and hygienic condition of objects of recreation. Therefore, taking measures, directed on stabilization and strengthening of the water management complex, construction and equipment of vacation spots, prevention and elimination of harmful effects of waters is necessary.																			1561-7793	1561-803X				OCT	2013		375					179	+																WOS:000421553300038

Combining Population Growth Model and Generalized Additive Model to Determine Optimal Water Level FOR Waterbird Conservation: A Case Study of Siberian Crane (Leucogeranus Leucogeranus) in Lake Poyang, China	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Siberian crane (Leucogeranus leucogeranus) is one of the most endangered species in the world. The ecological integrity of its main wintering ground at Poyang Lake in China is crucial for the future of the species because Poyang Lake accommodates 99% of its global population. With the Three Gorges Dam fully operational, science-based adaptive strategies are urgently needed to avoid catastrophic ecological consequences. This study quantified the link between water level variation and population growth rate of the Siberian crane in Poyang Lake using a suite of advanced statistical techniques. We first used the stochastic Gompert growth model within the state space modelling (SSM) framework to infer population growth rate, density dependence, and process variability and observation errors. We then applied generalized additive models (GAMs) to the population growth rate to quantify the effects of environmental stochasticity. Our SSM results indicated that there was little support for density dependence, and environmental stochasticity was the main forcing for Siberian crane population variations in Poyang Lake. Although the SSM suggested that water levels in both high- and low-water seasons were important factors for Siberian crane population, inference on their effects were elusive because of large confidence intervals of the estimated coefficients. Using GAM, we confirmed the non-linear effects of water level on population growth rate. Based on the modelled response curves, we proposed the optimal water level for Siberian crane conservation: (a) maximum summer water season level should be less than 19.5m and (b) minimum winter water level should be between 8.7-10.2m. Our methods of integrating population dynamic model and GAM have wide relevance for regional biological conversation efforts that seek to maintain a resilient population of threatened species.

However, compared to gradual climate changes, the impacts of weather extremes have been much less studied. An extreme flood struck Poyang Lake, China, a globally important wintering ground for waterbirds, in the winter of 2015-2016. The effects of the flood on waterbird richness and abundance at Poyang Lake was assessed by comparing waterbird survey data at nine sub-lakes before (2014-2015), during (20152016) and after (2016-2017 and 2017-2018) the winter flood. Flooding greatly influenced waterbird abundance, with the abundance of all birds and each bird group declining by 19.7-75.5% during the flood winter relative to their values during the previous winter. Total waterbird abundance increased rapidly to pre-flood levels 1 year after the flood, suggesting that flooding mainly influenced waterbird distributions by causing waterbirds to escape to adjacent refugia. The negative impacts of extreme flooding shown here indicate that caution should be exercised in planning for a dam at the outlet of Poyang Lake. The proposed dam might have the potential to create the extreme high water levels that are unsuitable for many waterbirds.																			1524-4695	1938-5390				MAR	2019	42	1					30	38		10.1675/063.042.0104	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/063.042.0104													WOS:000462578300004

Changing thermal dynamics of lakes in the Great Lakes region: Role of ice cover feedbacks	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												The impacts of climate variability and lake ice cover feedbacks on the seasonal thermal dynamics of inland lakes were evaluated for the period of 1916-2007. Analysis of regional scale impacts for the small inland lakes remains a major challenge in the Great Lakes region due to lack of observations at regional scale. Regional lakes were included into a land surface modeling perspective to understand the roles of climate variability on their open water season dynamics. The Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model was applied with a physically based lake algorithm to simulate thermal conditions of lakes at regional scale during the open water period. Prior to its implementation, the VIC model was evaluated for lake surface water temperature in the selected lakes within the study domain. Results suggested that the cold (October-May) and spring (March-May) season air temperatures have increased by 1.38 and 1.54 degrees C, respectively during the period of 1916-2007. Increase in air temperature was statistically significant at the regional scale. Onset of the stratified season has occurred earlier by more than five days during the period of 1916-2007. Earlier onset of the stratified season was significantly related to the length of the stratified season, thermal storage in the lakes, and mean lake surface water temperatures. The combined impacts of increased air temperature and earlier onset of the stratified season led to increased heat storage in lakes by 82.5 x 10(16) J. Degree-days above 15 and 20 degrees C also increased by 97.5 and 33.0 degree-days during the period of 1916-2007. The lake ice cover was significantly related with the annual lake evaporation, timing of ice formation and break-up in lakes, and heat storage during the spring and summer. Results suggested the climate warming may lead to increased rate of evaporation that is driven by feedbacks of ice cover and snow storage. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Most often, neither proxy data nor numerical modelling alone can adequately meet this requirement. In an effort to satisfy this need, the author suggests a method based seasonal circulation patterns and calculations of changes in evaporation rates over land and ocean. In this paper, circulation models for Australia at 18,000 yr B.P, are based on output from NCAR's Community Climate Model and evaporation rate changes are calculated for twelve regions within Australia, as well as eight offshore. Winter and summer palaeoclimates for each of these areas are retrodicted on the basis of these changes, and these retrodictions are tested against the available proxy data. While there are clear discrepancies between the data and retrodictions for the southern part of the continent, the method performs well in the north. This method has proven useful in reconciling apparently contradictory data, and in allowing retrodictions on the seasonal level and for providing palaeoclimatic estimates areas where data are scarce.																			0031-0182					JUL	1995	116	3-4					141	166		10.1016/0031-0182(94)00091-L	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(94)00091-L													WOS:A1995RN36100001

Microorganisms of Two Thermal Pools on Kunashir Island, Russia	BIOLOGY-BASEL												Simple Summary The Kuril Islands are a part of the Circum-Pacific Belt of volcanoes and have many hot springs. Nonetheless, due to the border regime, these islands are difficult to access, and microbial communities of the geothermal springs of these islands have hardly been studied microbiologically and have not been studied metagenomically at all. Here we conducted the first metagenomic study on two thermophilic microbial communities of Kunashir Island. Faust Lake is hot (48 degrees C) and highly acidic (pH 2.0), whereas the Tretyakovsky Thermal Spring is also hot (52 degrees C) but weakly acidic (pH 6.0). We demonstrated that water pH affects the composition of the microbial communities. The Kuril Archipelago is a part of the Circum-Pacific Belt (Ring of Fire). These islands have numerous thermal springs. There are very few studies on these microbial communities, and none of them have been conducted by modern molecular biological methods. Here we performed the first metagenomic study on two thermophilic microbial communities of Kunashir Island. Faust Lake is hot (48 degrees C) and highly acidic (pH 2.0). We constructed 28 metagenome-assembled genomes as well as 17 16S ribosomal RNA sequences. We found that bottom sediments of Faust Lake are dominated by a single species of red algae belonging to the Cyanidiaceae family. Archaeans in Faust Lake are more diverse than bacteria but less abundant. The Tretyakovsky Thermal Spring is also hot (52 degrees C) but only weakly acidic (pH 6.0). It has much higher microbial diversity (233 metagenome-assembled genomes; 93 16S ribosomal RNAs) and is dominated by bacteria, with only several archaeans and one fungus. Despite their geographic proximity, these two thermal springs were found to not share any species. A comparison of these two lakes with other thermal springs of the Circum-Pacific Belt revealed that only a few members of the communities are shared among different locations.

Energy optimization of a food-energy-water microgrid living laboratory in Yukon, Canada	ENERGY NEXUS												Like most northern settlements, Kluane Lake Research Station (KLRS) in Yukon Territory, Canada, is an islanded microgrid dependent on diesel generation and subject to high fuel costs. To reduce diesel costs, the station has a 48 kW solar photovoltaic (PV) array alongside a 27 kW/171 kWh lead-acid battery system to store solar energy for nighttime use, primarily during summer. However, substantial solar energy is often curtailed when the battery becomes full due to prior charging with diesel-generated electricity. The goal of this analysis is to determine how to best operate the diesel generator to maximize solar PV generation, and thus minimize diesel costs. On a monthly basis, solar PV plus batteries can meet 96% of load during June, but only 3% during December, and 67% year-round. This study also analyzes how demand-side management of new food and water infrastructure can aid this objective while providing a constant source of electricity, locally-grown food, and clean water. Findings demonstrate that optimizing the KLRS diesel generator, battery management, and solar energy conversion may reduce diesel generation by up to 100% during June, 31% during the field season (mid-April to early October), and approximately 31% year-round (due to limited solar PV generation during the winter), compared with past operational data.					; Penn, Henry/JQX-1453-2023	Jacobson, Mark/0000-0002-4315-4128; 													2772-4271					JUN	2023	10								100200	10.1016/j.nexus.2023.100200	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nexus.2023.100200		MAY 2023											WOS:001133874300001

Regional variation in Holocene climate quantified from pollen in the Great Plains of North America	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												The Great Plains experienced extreme fluctuations in precipitation and temperature throughout the Holocene, but these fluctuations have been difficult to quantify systematically across the region. Pollen has long been used as a proxy for reconstructing climate changes, but its power is limited if a region is devoid of modern pollen samples to facilitate comparison with known climate conditions. Here, we present a set of pollen-climate transfer functions developed using weighted-averaging partial least squares to reconstruct mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean temperature of the coldest month (MTcold) and mean temperature of the warmest month (MTwarm). At the foundation of these transfer functions is a new set of 141 modern pollen samples that specifically cover the climate space of the Great Plains. These functions quantify the relationship between pollen assemblages and modern climate in this region (r = 0.928, 0.838 and 0.897 for MAP, MTcold and MTwarm, respectively). We applied these functions to three previously established pollen records taken from lacustrine sites in the region - Fox Lake, MN; Moon Lake, ND; and Kettle Lake, ND - to reconstruct precipitation and temperature at these sites throughout the Holocene. Annual precipitation reconstructed with these transfer functions at Moon Lake and Kettle Lake does not capture a severe, prolonged period of drought during the mid-Holocene as seen in many other proxy records from these sites and from the region. Reconciliation of these results involves both the autecology of Ambrosia and the inability of any pollen surface samples to capture seasonal and short-term variability in precipitation. Thus, the transfer functions correctly reconstruct periodic wet summers and a disturbance factor favouring Ambrosia, but miss the effects of reduced winter precipitation and increased frequency of severe drought. The problem revealed here may be more general to biomes with higher frequency disturbance regimes and more weedy species.					; Morris, Christopher/H-3925-2011	McLauchlan, Kendra/0000-0002-6612-1097; 													0899-8418	1097-0088				MAR 30	2018	38	4					1794	1807		10.1002/joc.5296	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.5296													WOS:000427011700014

Total bacteria counts were established by 4',6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in the seasonal snow pack bordering the sea. On the sea shore, bacterial concentration was about 6 x 10(4) cells mL(-1), without any significant variation according to depth. In the accumulation snow layer of the glacier, concentrations were about 2 x 10(4) cells mL(-1), except in the 2003 summer layer, where it reached 2 x 10(5) cells mL(-1), as the result of cell multiplication allowed by higher temperature and snow melting. Strains isolated from the seasonal snow pack were identified from their 16S rRNA gene sequences, and lodged in GenBank. They belong to the Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. They are closely related to cold environment bacteria, as revealed by phylogenetic tree constructions, and two appear to be of unknown affiliation. Using H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance, it was shown that these isolates have the capacity to degrade organic compounds found in Arctic snow (propionate, acetate and formate), and this can allow them to develop when snow melts, and thus to be actively involved in snow chemistry.

J	Jones, B; Peng, XT				Jones, Brian; Peng, Xiaotong			Intrinsic versus extrinsic controls on the development of calcite dendrite bushes, Shuzhishi Spring, Rehai geothermal area, Tengchong, Yunnan Province, China	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												In the Rehai geothermal area, located near Tengchong, there is an old succession of crystalline calcite that formed from a spring that is no longer active. The thin-bedded succession, exposed on the south bank of Zaotang River, is formed of three-dimensional dendrite bushes that are up to 6 cm high and 3 cm in diameter with multiple levels of branching. Bedding is defined by color, which ranges from white to gray to almost black and locally accentuated by differential weathering that highlights the branching motif of the dendrites. The succession developed through repeated tripartite growth cycles that involved: Phase I that was characterized by rapid vertical growth of the dendrite bushes with ever-increasing branching; Phase II that developed once growth of the dendrites had almost or totally ceased, and involved an initial phase of etching that was followed by the precipitation of various secondary minerals (sheet calcite, trigonal calcite crystals, hexagonal calcite crystals, hexagonal plates formed of Ca and P, Mn precipitates, Si-Mg reticulate coatings, opal-CT lepispheres) on the branches of the calcite dendrites, and Phase III that involved deposition of detrital quartz, feldspar, clay, and calcite on top of the dendrite bushes. The tripartite growth cycle is attributed primarily to aperiodic cycles in the CO2 content of the spring water that was controlled by subsurface igneous activity rather than climatic controls. High CO2 coupled with rapid CO2 degassing triggered growth of the dendrite bushes. As CO2 levels waned, saturation levels in the spring water decreased and calcite dendrite growth ceased and precipitation of the secondary minerals took place, possibly in the microcosms of microbial mats. Deposition of the detrital sediment was probably related to surface runoff that was triggered by periods of high rainfall. Critically, this study shows that intrinsic factors rather than extrinsic factors (e.g., climate) were the prime control on the development of the tripartite growth cycle. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Hart, DR; Stone, L; Berman, T				Hart, DR; Stone, L; Berman, T			Seasonal dynamics of the Lake Kinneret food web: The importance of the microbial loop	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The role of bacteria and protozoa in the food web of Lake Kinneret was examined for 14 seasons over a 4-yr period (1989-1992) using a mass-balanced carbon Bur model and network analysis. These microorganisms supplied nearly half of the carbon requirements of metazoan zooplankton grazers during the late winter-spring Peridinium bloom, when the lake was in its most eutrophic phase. The level of primary productivity was not seen to have a significant effect on the relative amounts of carbon passing from bacteria and protozoa to higher trophic levels, Rather, this depended on the proportion of photosynthetically fixed carbon that originated from "inedible" net-phytoplankton and the efficiency with which bacterial carbon was transferred to metazoans. The importance of the microbial loop as a carbon source to higher trophic levels in Lake Kinneret was a result of the often high levels of inedible net-phytoplankton (mostly Peridinium gatunense). The higher levels also occurred because bacterial production was transferred to metazoans in a relatively efficient one- or two-step process. These results indicate that even in eutrophic environments, bacteria and protozoa can supply significant amounts of carbon to metazoans.					; Hart, Deborah/E-6917-2016	Stone, Lewi/0000-0002-6465-579X; Hart, Deborah/0000-0002-0406-0751; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2000	45	2					350	361		10.4319/lo.2000.45.2.0350	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2000.45.2.0350													WOS:000085822300010

The operation of the Three Gorges Dam has changed the water regime and has a significant impact on wetland ecosystems downstream. We studied the responses of two sympatric herbivorous goose species, the Lesser white-fronted goose Anser erythropus and Bean goose Anser fabalis, to habitat change by investigating their food conditions, habitat selection, and diet composition in the wintering periods of 2016/2017 and 2017/2018, which had early and late water recession, respectively. It was expected that the contrasting water regimes would result in different food conditions and geese responses. The results showed that the food quality and quantity differed significantly between winters. As responses to the high-quantity/low-quality food during 2016/2017, more geese switched to feeding on mudflat and exploited plants such as dicotyledons and moss. The tall swards of Carex spp. (dominant plants in the meadow) that developed during the first growing season decreased the food accessibility during the second growing season and hindered the exploitation of newly generated shoots by the geese, which was further confirmed by our clipping control experiment. Nearly all the geese chose to feed on meadow, and Carex spp. made up the majority of their diet in 2017/2018 when there was more low-quantity/high-quality food. Compared with the globally vulnerable Lesser white-fronted geese, the larger-sized Bean geese seemed to be less susceptible to winter food shortages and exhibited more stable responses. We concluded that the food quality-quantity condition was the external factor influencing the geese responses, while morphological and physiological traits could be the internal factors causing different responses between the two species. This study enhanced the understanding of the influence that habitat change exerts on herbivorous geese in their wintering site in the context of the Three Gorges Dam operation. We suggested that regulating hydrological regime was important in terms of wetland management and species conservation.					; Zhang, Siqi/GWZ-5619-2022; LI, feng/HIR-1703-2022	Chen, Xin-sheng/0009-0009-6601-8725; Zhang, Pingyang/0000-0001-9767-0550; , Xinsheng/0000-0002-3720-247X													2045-7758					JUN	2020	10	12					5281	5292		10.1002/ece3.6272	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.6272		APR 2020						32607151					WOS:000527067700001
J	Kim, G; Kim, SJ; Harada, K; Schultz, MK; Burnett, WC				Kim, G; Kim, SJ; Harada, K; Schultz, MK; Burnett, WC			Enrichment of excess 210Po in anoxic ponds	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												We have investigated the cycling of naturally occurring Po-210 in waters from seasonally anoxic Pond B (South Carolina) and permanently anoxic Jellyfish Lake (Palau Islands, western Pacific Ocean). The maximum Po-210 activity in Pond B was about 14 mBq L-1 during summer. This activity was much higher than its parent Pb-210 activity, indicating excess Po-210 inputs from bottom sediments. The summertime excess Po-210 activity was accompanied by increases in Fe and Mn, suggesting Po-210 diffusion from bottom sediments under reducing conditions. Activity of Po-210 was much lower under winter oxic conditions, most likely a consequence of efficient coprecipitation with Fe and Mn oxides that occurs with destruction of Pond B stratification. In permanently anoxic Jellyfish Lake, the maximum activity of Po-210 was 133 mBq L-1, among the highest reported from any surface aqueous environment. A box model suggests that the release of only 2% of Po-210, produced from the Pb-210 in the bottom sediments, would account for the observed excess. Our results suggest that Po-210 can be naturally enriched in anoxic environments to a high level, perhaps in concert with the Fe and Mn redox cycles.

The growth rate of both species was significantly greater for individuals captured over the cobble/rubble shoals. Females of both species were faster growing than the males, although only significantly so in the white perch. The seasonal diet and breadth of diet (H') of yellow perch and white perch were not substantially different with respect to substrate type. Diet overlap between substrate types was also equivalent for each species. Benthic invertebrates, primarily Gammarus spp., were the major prey of both species at all sites. Alewife eggs were the most important item for the white perch in mid-summer, and alewife juveniles were important to both species in the fall. Differences in growth patterns between cobble/rubble shoals and sand sites illustrate a subtle effect of habitat on these species.					; Danehy, Robert/AAJ-5876-2020	Danehy, Robert/0000-0002-0012-9010; 													0380-1330						1991	17	2					183	193		10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71355-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71355-5													WOS:A1991FZ32800005

Distribution of aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages in a subtropical coastal lake: Response to environmental parameters	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Understanding the distribution of aquatic invertebrates and its relationship with environmental parameters has been challenging in subtropical freshwater coastal ecosystems. In this study, we investigate the environmental drivers of the distribution of aquatic invertebrates across different spatial and temporal scales in a freshwater lagoon. We sampled five sampling sites with an Ekman-Birge grab during 12 months and analyzed sediments and the invertebrate community. The results showed that the composition of sediment particles and organic matter varied significantly among the sampling sites. In contrast, water chemistry variables showed only seasonal differences. Significant differences in taxonomic richness and total density were observed among sampling sites and seasons. Principal component and the BIO-ENV routine analyses showed that local-scale factors (e.g. grain size) were the most important spatial determinants for the ordination of aquatic macroinvertebrates. Invertebrate assemblages responded to spatial and temporal variability with changes in their abundance and taxonomic richness. Our results suggest that community changes may be related to seasonality, which is marked by well-defined summers and winters, as well as for the grain-particle size composition and organic matter percentage in the sediment.

J	Mackay, JR				Mackay, JR			Periglacial features developed on the exposed lake bottoms of seven lakes that drained rapidly after 1950, Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula area, western Arctic coast, Canada	PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES												A variety of periglacial features have been studied on the exposed bottoms of seven lakes that drained rapidly after 1950 in the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula area, western Arctic coast, Canada. Ice-wedge growth commenced as early as the first winter following drainage. In most areas, ice-wedge growth cease within several decades, because of the growth and spread of vegetation which resulted in snow entrapment and increased ground temperatures. At sites where thermokarst lake enlargement had transgressed across terrain with ice-wedge polygons, reactivated polygon patterns developed rapidly in some pre-drainage shallow water areas, with the sites of former troughs becoming ridges. Excavations across the ridges exposed extensive differential frost heave, cryoturbations, and slickensided vertical shear planes. Many collapse pits developed because of differential frost heave between silts and sands, cavity formation beneath the frozen silts, and cavity infilling with adjacent sand in late summer. Other collapse pits developed, either subaqueously prior to drainage or subaerially after drainage. Underground flow has been observed, in early summer, where a near-surface layer of ice-rich silts was underlain by desiccated active layer sands at a temperature well below 0 degrees C. At some sites where there has been underground flow some differential loading and water escape features appear to have developed during the thaw period. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Moreover, the ecology of floodplain lakes is modulated by exchanges of water with the main stream. On Amazonian flood plains, the water level fluctuates seasonally, with four distinct stages during the year: rising, high, falling, and low water. This study evaluated how/which three functional approaches to phytoplankton (FG, functional groups; MFG, morphofunctional groups; and MBFG, morphology-based functional groups) showed the largest relation to the environmental variations in response to rising and falling water periods, using data of the seven lakes sampled during rising and falling water periods, on the Curuai Floodplain system, Para state, Brazil. We used a Principal Coordinates Analysis to check for differences in phytoplankton species composition between the rising and falling water periods and a Redundancy Analysis to evaluate the relationship between functional approaches and environmental. Electrical conductivity, silica, and pH were the most important environmental variables to structuring the phytoplankton. The biological dissimilarity was computed using Bray-Curtis index for species biovolume and indicated greater similarity among the species compositions in the lakes during the falling water period. During rising water species is adapted in almost all lentic ecosystems (FG Y) and autotrophic organisms typical from the meroplanktonic that can be found in phytoplankton samples of the shallow lakes (FG MP); cryptomonads (MFG 2d), large centrics (MFG 6a), and large pennates (MFG 6b); and non flagellated organisms with siliceous exoskeletons (MBFG VI) and unicellular flagellates of medium to large size (MBFG V) were predominant. During falling water, species that tolerate eutrophic to hypertrophic environments with low nitrogen content predominated all shallow lakes (FGs H1 and M; MFGs 5e and 5b; and MBFGs III and VII) and Dolichospermum spp. formed blooms. Morphology-based functional groups were the larger relation with the environmental variations than did functional groups and morphofunctional groups. MBFGs provides a relatively simple and objective classification and were the best in characterizing phytoplankton dynamics on the Curuai floodplain. Therefore, we recommend using these groups to study phytoplankton ecology in shallow floodplain lakes.					; Kraus, Cleber/M-1838-2016; Bonnet, Marie-Paule/J-6888-2016; Nogueira, Ina/K-9012-2012; garnier, jeremie/AAK-8470-2021	da Motta Marques, David/0000-0002-3809-8053; Bonnet, Marie-Paule/0000-0002-3950-4041; Nunes Kraus, Cleber/0000-0002-5116-3681; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2018	95		1				579	588		10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.07.038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.07.038													WOS:000456907400055

At present, the arid regions of East Asia constitute a major global dust source. However, the provenance and transport mechanisms of East Asian dust (EAD) to the ocean remain debated. Here, we analyzed the Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic data from the clay (<2 mu m) and coarse-silt (30-63 mu m) fractions of sediment cores LV53-19/22 from the central Japan Sea, to reconstruct the evolution of EAD input into the marginal seas from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the Holocene (26-4 ka BP). The 30-63 mu m fraction was dominantly transported by the East Asian winter monsoon, with its isotopic variability reflecting shifts in dust source regions under changing climate regimes. The <2 mu m fraction, strongly influenced by chemical weathering, likely reflects a mixture of EAD, riverine discharge, and volcanic input from the Japanese Islands. From the LGM to the mid-Holocene, EAD provenance shifted from a mixed contribution of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), North China Block, and Chinese Loess Plateau to a dominant CAOB source, driven by combined changes in intensity of East Asian winter and summer monsoons. Synchronous shifts in dust composition across alpine lakes in Northeast China and the Philippine Sea since the last deglaciation (similar to 15 ka BP) underscore the dominant role of East Asian monsoon in governing both the provenance and transport of EAD to the ocean. Under projected global warming, the CAOB is likely to make an increasingly dominant contribution to EAD to the ocean.					shi, xuefa/AAC-6977-2022; Vasilenko, Yuriy/C-3259-2018														1674-7313	1869-1897				JUL	2025	68	7					2361	2372		10.1007/s11430-025-1596-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11430-025-1596-y		JUN 2025											WOS:001513504000001

FOOD AND FEEDING-HABITS	AUSTRALIAN WILDLIFE RESEARCH												The food and feeding habits of 2 spp. of cormorant were studied on a group of freshwater lakes in inland New South Wales [Australia]. P. sulcirostris fed mainly on exotic fish (69% of live wt of prey), captured while fishing communually in the deeper waters. P. melanoleucos fed mainly on native decapod crustaceans (60% of prey) captured while fishing individually in the shallow parts of the lakes and in nearby billabongs and farm dams. P. sulcirostris took larger common carp Carassius auratus, redfin Perca fluviatilis and yabby Cherax destructor than its congener. Seasonal changes in the diet of P. sulcirostris were similar in each year; its major prey, common carp and redfin, were least available during winter and spring, as fry grew too large to be captured and swallowed. Changes in diet of P. melanoleucos were irregular, as the availability of yabby, its major prey, was influenced by the turbidity, level and temperature of water. Seasonal changes in diets of both cormorants were attributed to changes in prey availability and not changes in food preference. Food of nestlings sometimes differed from that of adults.																			0310-7833						1979	6	1					79	95																WOS:A1979GN88100009

Longshore wind, waves and currents: climate and climate projections at Ninety Mile Beach, southeastern Australia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												It is shown that Lakes Entrance, a township located at the northern end of Ninety Mile Beach in southeastern Australia, is situated in a region that may experience noticeable changes in longshore wind, wave and ocean currents compared to present day climate variability as a consequence of the southward shifting subtropical ridge (STR) predicted in global climate change models. These changes could modify sediment transport in the littoral zone and impact the coastline position. Thirty-year hindcasts of winds, coastal currents and waves are shown to agree well with available observations and provide a long-term dataset of the climate variability. Hindcasts of coastal ocean currents and waves indicate that while the annual net mean wave and current transport are in opposing directions, their seasonal adjusted monthly anomalies are positively correlated. Furthermore they are also correlated with the position of the STR location index. On seasonal to annual time scales a weak connection between the transport variables and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) is found. It appears that during multiple years of positive (negative) SOI conditions the STR is located north (south) of its mean monthly position, resulting in anomalous eastward (westward) transport. The four climate models used in this study indicate a southward shift in the STR for most months under a high emission future. In summer months the shift in the STR results in both increased summer westward wind-driven currents and westward wave forcing. Changes in winter months are less related to the STR location and it is discussed that the contraction and increased intensity of the westerly storm belt linked to Southern Annular Mode could possibly influence the transport. The analysis is presented at the coastal scale to provide insights into how these changes may affect net transport across the littoral zone in more detailed numerical nearshore sediment transport modelling.					; Babanin, Alexander/A-6676-2008; McInnes, Kathleen/A-7787-2012; O'Grady, Julian/T-2742-2019; O'Grady, Julian/H-9603-2016; Hemer, Mark/M-1905-2013	Babanin, Alexander/0000-0002-8595-8204; McInnes, Kathleen/0000-0002-1810-7215; O'Grady, Julian/0000-0003-3552-9193; Hemer, Mark/0000-0002-7725-3474													0899-8418	1097-0088				NOV 30	2015	35	14					4079	4093		10.1002/joc.4268	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.4268													WOS:000365518600003

The current study investigates the spread of a commonly found invasive species in coastal wetlands in Northeastern US, the Phragmites australis. Within a relatively pristine wetland complex in coastal New Jersey, we collected high-resolution multispectral remote sensing images for eight years (2011-2018), in both winter and summer seasons. The land cover/land use status in this wetland complex is relatively simple, contains only five identifiable vegetation covers and water. Applying high accuracy machine learning algorithms, we are able to classify the land use/land cover in the complex and use the classified images as the basis for the grey system coupled system dynamics simulative model. The simulative model produces land use land cover change in the wetland complex for the next 25 years. Results suggest that Phragmites australis will increase in coverage in the future, despite the stable intensity of anthropogenic activities. The wetland complex could lose its essential ecological services to serve as an exchange spot for nekton species from the sea.

For this purpose the isotopic composition of DIC (delta C-13(DIC)) in pore water was coupled with a comprehensive pore water chemistry and sediment environment. The model accounting for diffusion, irrigation, and the remineralization of organic carbon was used to better understand the observed variations in concentration of DIC. Modeled profile of delta C-13(DIC) in the deepest part of the Lake 658 did not agree with the concentration DIC data. This indicate that a diagenetic model for isotopic data must include other processes such as oxidation of methane within the sediments. The amount of organic carbon regenerated by methane fermentation which was found to be the predominant way of methane formation in the boreal Lake 658 was estimated to be between 8 and 78% depending on the temperature and organic carbon input. Using the model the observed isotopic and concentration profiles of DIC in sediments of Lake Bled are reproducible. The dominant carbon isotope effect expressed during early diagenesis of organic matter is associated with methanogenesis which proceeds preferentially by CO2 reduction. The highest contribution of carbonate dissolution was observed in the oxygenated part of the lake in spring (12%), characterized by lower bottom water temperatures and slower degradation of sedimentary organic matter. Further it was found that even if the pathways of methane formation are different in soft lakes compared to carbonate rich lakes, the contribution of methanogenesis to DIC is similar in anoxic parts of the lake and represents up to 78% to DIC. A model that accurately described the profiles of DIC concentrations in marine sediments could not be used to reproduce the observed isotopic profiles. However, there is a clear indication that the delta C-13 of DIC added to the pore water was significantly greater than the delta C-13 of organic carbon. Dissolution of CaCO3 was estimated to contribute 35 and 57% to DIC in winter and late spring, respectively and 14% in late summer when the degradation of organic matter was the highest. Another source of C-13-enriched carbon in pore waters might be diffusion of bottom-water CO32- into the sediments, or the diffusion of C-13-depleted H2CO3* from pore waters to bottom water.

With the depletion of fish stocks in the Yangtze River in recent decades, food availability has become the most important factor affecting the survival of this subspecies. Despite this, the relationships between fish community and occurrences of porpoise are far from being fully understood. Therefore, during September 2013 to August 2014, the occurrences of porpoise were investigated in confluence of the Yangtze and Wanhe Rivers; fish community was also surveyed synchronously in confluence and two adjacent transects. The results showed that (1) the confluence had maximum fish species richness, and the main dominant species was upper fish, while the other two transects were mainly dominated by demersal fish. ANOVA analyses showed that individual number and yield of upper fish which can be eaten by porpoise (upper edible fish) in the confluence were significantly higher than other two transects. (2) Average group size of the porpoise was 3.7 +/- 1.8 individuals. The occurrences of porpoise in different seasons had great differences, and the porpoise was more likely to be detected in autumn and winter. (3) Fish community had significant effects on occurrences of porpoise, and the main influencing factors were fish species richness, individual number, and yield of edible fish, especially the upper edible fish. The results of this study will have important implications for the conservation of porpoise.

The eastern population breeds in the Amur region of China and Russia and winters in Korea, whereas the western population breeds in northeastern Mongolia and winters at Poyang Lake in China. The aim of this study was to examine the population characteristics of white-naped cranes wintering in Korea and clarify the migratory behavior of the western population, which has been poorly understood. Population trends were assessed using data from the Winter Waterbird Census of Korea. In 2022 and 2023, the migratory routes were tracked using GPS transmitters attached to 12 cranes captured in eastern Mongolia. The analysis revealed a remarkable 2313.7% increase in the number of cranes wintering in Korea between 2000 and 2024 and demonstrated an expansion in their wintering range. The findings also confirmed that some individuals from the western population migrate to Poyang Lake and Korea. Systematic habitat management and improved wintering conditions on the Korean Peninsula could have been crucial factors in this increase. This study highlights the Korean Peninsula as a key wintering site for white-naped cranes in East Asia, providing valuable insights for future conservation strategies.

Geoffrey; Li, Jia; Tuo, You-Cai			Impact of climate change on thermal and mixing regimes in a deep dimictic reservoir on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Climate change is one of the most serious threats to aquatic ecosystems in lakes and reservoirs. Aquatic organisms on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in China are particularly susceptible to changes in water temperature and hydraulic status. To better characterize the evolution of the thermal and mixing regimes of deep reservoirs under climate change on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model (CE-QUAL-W2) of Pangduo Reservoir was established, calibrated, and verified using observational data. We used representative concentration pathways (RCP) 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 based on the GFDL-ESM2M output data after bias correction using the ISIMIP2b dataset to simulate the water temperature distribution from 2021 to 2099. Our results show that Pangduo Reservoir's annual mean surface water temperature has small differences under RCP 2.6 and RCP 4.5, but there are significantly increases of 0.12 degrees C and 0.22 degrees C decade(-1) under RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5, respectively. The water age in the hypolimnion also increases by 0.05, 0.92, 1.73, and 3.2 d decade(-1) under RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, and RCP 8.5, respectively. The delay in offset of summer stratification became a key feature in response to climate warming (the longest delay change was 3.21 d decade(-1) under RCP 8.5). Furthermore, simulated climate warming caused the compression of the spring convective periods and the strengthening of stratification in summer, which commonly weakened or even eliminated the replenishment of dissolved oxygen (DO) to the hypolimnion via vertical mixing. The depth of inflow intrusion also increased significantly (0.71 m decade(-1) under RCP 8.5), enhancing summer thermal stratification. The increase in the depth of inflow intrusion and the extension of the age of hypolimnetic water pose potential threats to water quality and ecological health in the reservoir. The concentration of DO in the hypolimnion also significantly decreased under RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, and RCP 8.5. These issues may also exist in other dimictic reservoirs and lakes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

As a top predator, the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) may have a powerful effect on the biodiversity and ecological functionality of small ponds, regardless of their purpose (e.g. aquaculture, angling or conservation). Our study sought to analyze the feeding habits of otter in a near-natural system (Csombardi pond, SW Hungary). From December 2010 to November 2011, the annual composition of otter diet was assessed by the analysis of spraint samples (n=483). Fish abundance was assessed from spring to autumn by electrofishing and fyke nets. Throughout the study period, the main food source of the otter was fish (73.5-84.9% of occurrences), while amphibians represented a secondary resource. Otters behaved as opportunistic hunters, preying primarily on the most abundant fish species and size classes and conforming to seasonal variation in fish availability. Otter preferences in relation to fish habitat zones (shorezone or littoral, metaphyton, pelagic, benthic) and origin (native, non-native) differed according to the sampling method used to assess fish availability, suggesting that the sampling method chosen may distort the assessment of prey preference by otters. Two-thirds of fish eaten consisted of non-native species. Results may be useful for the conservation of otters, near-natural ponds, and associated native fish communities.					; Lanszki, Jozsef/AAN-1013-2020	Lanszki, Jozsef/0000-0002-2067-6601; Ferincz, Arpad/0000-0003-2420-0245; 													1863-9135					APR	2014	184	2					161	168		10.1127/1863-9135/2014/0616	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1863-9135/2014/0616													WOS:000337210400007

The impact of intraspecific variation in a fish predator on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity and investment in sex in Daphnia ambigua	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Theory predicts that the evolution of phenotypic plasticity depends upon cues that indicate environmental change. Predators typically induce plastic responses in prey. However, variation among populations of predators alters the frequency of predation and, possibly, the evolution of plasticity. We compared responses to predator cues in Daphnia ambigua from lakes where alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) either do (anadromous) or do not (landlocked) migrate between marine and freshwater. In anadromous lakes, Daphnia are abundant each spring but eliminated by alewives in summer, whereas Daphnia are constantly under the threat of predation in landlocked lakes. Daphnia from anadromous lakes grew faster, matured earlier and larger, produced more offspring and invested more in sex than Daphnia from landlocked lakes. We observed several significant lake type-by-predator treatment interactions. These interactions, whereby the differences between lakes were greater in predator-conditioned water, agree with theory and argue that Daphnia plasticity has been influenced by variation in alewives.

Role of Sewage Discharge on the Diversity and Distribution of Zooplankton in the Mahanadi River, India	ASIAN JOURNAL OF WATER ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION												Zooplankton forms an important component of fish fries and helps to transfer energy from primary to secondary and tertiary levels in a food chain. Realizing the paucity of patent literature on the zooplankton population of sewage- fed river Mahanadi, studies were undertaken to assess the seasonal dynamics of zooplankton populations and nutrient status of water for a period of one year covering three seasons. Zooplankton population and water analysis was performed using standard procedure. Maximum population density was observed in the winter season followed by summer and lastly rainy. Higher zooplankton populations were encountered in Sikharpur (site IV). They corresponded to the fluctuation of prevailing conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, better organic load and chemical oxygen demand content of the said habitat. A total of 14 species belonging to six different groups were recorded during the study period. Lower concentration of zooplankton at Sikharpur site indicates polluted zone of the river. Our findings highlighted the deterioration of water quality in the river due to industrialization and human activities. Proper biological and chemical treatment of domestic sewage and industrial effluents before discharge to river system is suggested.

Two distinct flyways with different population trends of Bewick's Swan Cygnus columbianus bewickii in East Asia	WILDFOWL												Two of the most fundamental ecological questions about any species relate to where they occur and in what abundance. Here, we combine GPS telemetry data, survey data and expert knowledge for the first time to define two distinct flyways (the East Asian Continental and West Pacific flyways), migration routes and abundance for the Eastern population of Bewick's Swan Cygnus columbianus bewickii. The Eastern population is the largest flyway population, supporting c. 77% of Bewick's Swan numbers globally. GPS telemetry data showed that birds breeding in the Russian arctic from the Yamal Peninsula to c. 140 degrees E (including the Lena and Yana Deltas), winter in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China (which we label the "East Asian Continental flyway"). Bewick's Swans breeding from the Indigirka River east to the Koluchin Bay winter in Japan, mostly in Niigata, Yamagata and Ishikawa Prefectures (the "West Pacific flyway"). There was no overlap in migration routes used by tagged individuals from the two flyways. Counts of Bewick's Swans in the East Asian Continental flyway during the 21st century have shown wide between-year variations, reflecting incomplete coverage in earlier years. Bewick's Swans in this flyway currently numbers c. 65,000 birds based on extensive wintering survey coverage, compared to c. 81,000 in the early 2000s, based on less complete coverage. Chinese-wintering swans now concentrate mainly (c. 80%) at Poyang Lake in Jiangxi Province and Hubei Lakes (mostly in Longgan Lake), compared to a more widespread distribution both within Poyang and throughout the Auhui Lakes in 2004 and 2005. In contrast, Bewick's Swans of the West Pacific flyway now numbers c. 40,000, compared to just 542 in 1970. This population has shown no significant overall change since 2004, when it numbered c. 45,000 birds. Small numbers within this population probably also winter in South Korea. These results provide our first basic understanding of the winter distribution of Chinese- and Japanese-wintering Bewick's Swans in relation to their breeding areas, confirming the need to coordinate future research and monitoring in the two flyways, as well as the need for more information on swans wintering in South Korea.					; Solovyeva, Diana/J-7302-2012; Lameris, Thomas/M-9567-2019; Kazantzidis, Savas/AAF-5977-2020; Batbayar, Nyambayar/N-7066-2015; Rees, Eileen/GZM-7164-2022; Bysykatova-Harmey, Inga/LSL-5268-2024; Zhao, Qingshan/O-2694-2018; Moriguchi, Sachiko/M-1117-2019; Davaasuren, Batmunkh/HGB-1791-2022; Fang, Lei/Q-4913-2019; Zhenggang, Xu/ABE-9095-2020; Antonov, Aleksey/A-3584-2017; Rees, Eileen/I-5835-2019; Stepanov, Alexander/LXW-1301-2024	Cao, Lei/0000-0002-1157-0303; Rees, Eileen/0000-0002-2247-3269; Davaasuren, Batmunkh/0000-0002-8496-1508; Zhao, Qingshan/0000-0002-3767-1102; Xie, YanBo/0009-0000-5548-512X; 													0954-6324	2052-6458					2020					6		13	42																WOS:000611498400002

It is the habitat of the endemic Artemia urmiana. Over the period July 1994-January 1996 a sampling campaign was organized: 36 fixed sampling stations, distributed over the entire lake's area, were sampled weekly to determine water temperature, salinity and transparency. At each occasion a filter net was dragged over a distance of 400 m in the superficial water layer to assess the density and composition of the Artemia population. A more limited sampling campaign focused on the annual fluctuations in chlorophyll concentration and on the reproductive behaviour of the brine shrimp population. Several stages of brine shrimp survived during winter months (water temperature 3degreesC) at low densities. Compared to available data for the Great Salt Lake, USA, Lake Urmiah shows a low algal biomass and overall low Artemia density. The increasing grazing pressure of the developing brine shrimp population in spring seems to prevent the phytoplankton from reaching high blooming concentrations, and oviparity is the dominant reproductive mode throughout the reproductive season.																			0018-8158					DEC	2001	466	1-3					133	143		10.1023/A:1014510730467	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1014510730467													WOS:000174354200012

Three distinct climatic regimes, ie, Phase I, II and III, were established. Phase I ( 3660-similar to 3400 yr BP) shows a gradual weakening of SW monsoonal activity, though overlapped by enhanced western disturbances which led to the development of cool climatic conditions. The coupled effect of SW monsoon and enhanced winter precipitation produced improved hydrological conditions, which supported the agrarian society of the Indus Valley civilization until the beginning of Phase II (similar to 3400 -similar to 3000 yr BP). During Phase II the SW monsoon was in a state of severe recession, leading to severe drought-like conditions, other than for a brief but intensely warm and humid pulse recorded at similar to 3320 yr BP, associated with SW monsoonal activity. In Phase III (similar to 3000 - 2850 yr BP), SW precipitation fluctuated greatly with a considerable increase in warm summer conditions, similar to present-day conditions. The weak SW monsoonal activity similar to 3500 yr BP also coincided with a global cool and arid phase and this probably explains the timing as well as the cause of why the population of the Indus civilization migrated to more humid areas to sustain their livelihoods.

We present one season of EC measurements conducted on the Rappbode Reservoir, Germany's largest drinking water reservoir. A floating observation platform in the centre of the reservoir is used for observations of fluxes that were unaffected by surrounding land surfaces and therefore representative of the actual water-atmosphere exchange. The temporal patterns of sensible heat flux are inverted compared to land sites, since the maxima and the minima occur at night and day respectively. The latent heat flux and the evaporation are unexpectedly low for a site where evaporation is not limited by the availability of water. The daily totals in summer and autumn are only 50% and 75% of the potential evaporation assessed by the FAO grass-reference evaporation, respectively. Measurement uncertainties and the effects of the energy balance closure are ruled out as potential factors, so that low values appear to be a general feature of large water surfaces. The observed carbon dioxide fluxes are characterized by distinctive diurnal variations in a typical range for lakes and reservoirs. However, the methane fluxes are low compared to other inland waters.

Assessment of long-term trends for management of Candlewood Lake, Connecticut, USA	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Candlewood Lake, the largest;lake in Connecticut, is a pumped-storage reservoir formed in the 1920s for hydropower generation. Since its inception, the lake has experienced shifts in water quality coupled with watershed development and, in the 1980s, the introduction and spread of the invasive macrophyte, Myriophyllum spicatum. In response, a monitoring program to track water quality, and a winter drawdown program to mitigate growth of M. spicatum were initiated in 1985. Recently it was sugpested that the drawdovvn program exacerbated eutrophication of the lake. To test this hypothesis, statistical analyses of the long-term (1985 to 2012) database was conducted with a focus on trophicrelated variables. We examined the database using principal component analysis (PCA) and multivarite singular spectrum analysis (MSSA). MSSA is an extension of PCA for multivariate time series data that accounts for both temporal and cross-sectional dependencies We found no evidence that the trophic condition declined, or that the drawdowns have deteriorated the water quality. Instead, we found that lower TS, TSIchi, and TSSD values corresponding with improved trophic conditions occurred in summers following deep drawdowns, while significantly higher values correlated with shallow and less effective drawdowns. Overall, there has been a modest improvement in the trophic condition overtime, attributed to a combination of the winter drawdowns and management efforts. In contrast, a steady and significant increase in dissolved salts, likely due to enhanced use of road deicing treatments, was documented.

J	Andradóttir, HO; Nepf, HM				Andradóttir, HO; Nepf, HM			Impact of exchange flows on wetland flushing	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The flushing of littoral regions is governed by barotropic river flows, Q(R), and baroclinic exchange flows, DeltaQ. This note presents field observations of two different flushing regimes in a shallow wetland that borders a lake. In spring, when river flows are high, the wetland circulation is river- or jet-dominated, DeltaQ/Q(R) < 1, and the river short-circuits through the wetland in a much shorter time than the nominal residence time. During summer low flows, however, the wetland circulation is dominated by exchange flows, DeltaQ/QR > 1, that vary both on diurnal and synoptic (10-20 days) timescales in response to differential heating and cooling between the wetland and lake and to wind. These exchange flows can enhance wetland flushing by a factor of 10 relative to river flushing. A one-dimensional decoupled heat and flow model represents diurnal exchange flows in this system well and may be used to assess the importance of exchange flows in other systems.					; Andradottir, Hrund/M-2013-2015	Andradottir, Hrund/0000-0002-4832-1503; Nepf, Heidi/0000-0002-3663-9071													0043-1397					DEC	2001	37	12					3265	3273		10.1029/2001WR000257	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2001WR000257													WOS:000173283000033

In recent years, many approaches have been developed to link habitat suitability with animal occurrence and abundance. These approaches typically involve identifying existing habitats, defining habitat quality metrics, and estimating the association between animal occurrence/abundance and measured habitat metrics. In this study, we first tested whether we could measure habitat quality at Dongting Lake, China, one of the most important migratory waterbird wintering sites in the East Asian Flyway, for a group of Anatidae using metrics derived from the freely available multi-temporal MODIS vegetation index. The results showed that goose counts could be sufficiently modelled using mean winter season EVI (enhanced vegetation index) and habitat size computed from EVI time series and topographic wetness index (TWI). We then quantified the relationships between hydrological regimes and the habitat quality metrics. Our findings suggested that the timing of optimal water draw down should be early to mid October to ensure quality food sources for the wintering geese in Dongting Lake. The results have direct conservation implications as water recession timing is highly manageable through water flow regulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Sediment resuspension in Saginaw Bay	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												An integrated hydrodynamic and sediment transport model was applied to Saginaw Bay for the ice-free portions of 2009 and 2010. Observations of surface waves and suspended sediment concentration made during the spring of both years were used to constrain the model and to validate the model output. The results show that sediment resuspension in both the inner and outer bay is due almost entirely to surface wave action, and that the bulk of the resuspension events occur during the fall of each year. Although the model accurately predicted the occurrence of resuspension events, it did not always accurately simulate the amount of material resuspended. Because resuspension mixes bottom sediment into the water column and makes it and associated nutrients available to the biota, the effects of sediment resuspension need to be accounted for in any water quality model of the bay. Better specification of both the surface waves and the initial specification of the bottom sediment would probably improve the performance of the model.

J	James, WF; Barko, JW; Eakin, HL; Sorge, PW				James, WF; Barko, JW; Eakin, HL; Sorge, PW			Phosphorus budget and management strategies for an urban Wisconsin lake	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Multiple external and internal phosphorus (P) sources to an urban lake, Half Moon Lake in Wisconsin, were examined during the summer of 1999 in order to develop management strategies for effective P control and reversal of eutrophication (Trophic State Index=74). Internal recycling of P accounted for 80% of the summer P budget of the take. Flux of P from the sediment accounted for most of the internal P loading(42% of total budget). However, decomposition of Potamogeton crispus and recycling of macrophyte P during the middle of the summer growing season, and P resuspension due to motor boat activity, accounted for 20% and 17% of the P budget, respectively, representing additional important sources to be controlled. In contrast, summer P loading via the watershed (storm sewers and precipitation) was much less. Using a water quality model (Bathtub),we found that reduction of internal P sources could substantially reduce by greater than 70% the high concentrations of algae in the lake (mean summer chlorophyll = 82 mg.m(-3)). Suggested internal P control measures included a sediment chemical treatment to bind P, greater harvesting of P. crispus to reduce the macrophyte P pool at the time of senescence, and limiting motor boat activity when the take is weakly stratified.																			1040-2381					JUN	2002	18	2					149	163		10.1080/07438140209354145	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140209354145													WOS:000178729600006

These stagnant water levels isolate the bottom from the mixolimnion above. The population of Cyclops scutifer in this lake shows a life cycle alternating between active phases in the plankton and diapause in the sediment. Diapause is part of a complex life cycle with both one- and two-year components. Samples from three stations showed that diapause both in the monimolimnion (33 and 27 m depth) and in the transition zone(14 m depth) is initiated during summer and autumn. The termination of diapause takes place at all three sampling stations from April to the end of May. A small component of diapausing copepodids ill, IV, and V (C III-C V) of Cyclops scutifer; dominated by C IV, descends into the monimolimnion for dormancy. The monimolimnion is shut off from any measurable physical variations in the environment. Whether the emergence from the monimolimnion is caused by internal physiological processes alone or by very subtle chemical changes in the environment is open to question.																			0071-1128		3-510-47054-0				1998	52						371	381																WOS:000089402600028

Snowfall in the Northern Great Lakes: Lessons Learned from a Multisensor Observatory	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												A multisensor snowfall observational suite has been deployed at the Marquette, Michigan, National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office (KMQT) since 2014. Micro Rain Radar (MRR; profiling radar), Precipitation Imaging Package (PIP; snow particle imager), and ancillary ground-based meteorological observations illustrate the unique capabilities of these combined instruments to document radar and concomitant microphysical properties associated with northern Great Lakes snowfall regimes. Lake-effect, lake-orographic, and transition event case studies are presented that illustrate the variety of snowfall events that occur at KMQT. Case studies and multiyear analyses reveal the ubiquity of snowfall produced by shallow events. These shallow snowfall features and their distinctive microphysical fingerprints are often difficult to discern with conventional remote sensing instruments, thus highlighting the scientific and potential operational value of MRR and PIP observations. The importance of near-surface lake-orographic snowfall enhancement processes in extreme snowfall events and regime-dependent snow particle microphysical variability controlled by regime and environmental factors are also highlighted.

Air2water model with nine parameters for lake surface temperature assessment	LIMNOLOGICA												The air2water model is a physically-based model in which major physical processes are parameterized. It allows to predict the surface lake temperature based solely on the time series of the air temperature. Due to its simplicity and very limited data requirements, it has found numerous applications around the globe. The air2water model defines the normalized depth of the well-mixed surface layer using a fixed parameter. This parameter is a threshold value that is set to 4 degrees C - the temperature of water with maximum density - for dimictic lakes, and to the minimum or to the maximum water temperature for warm or cold monomictic lakes, respectively. In this paper we propose to calibrate the threshold value as the ninth parameter of the model, instead of setting it fixed. We test the proposed approach on a set of 30-years long daily data from 22 lakes located in the lowland part of Poland and 25-years long daily data from the two Great Lakes - Huron and Eire. The proposed modification is very simple and improves the performance of the model, especially for winter-spring season, for the vast majority of lakes not only for the calibration, but also for the independent 8-10 years long validation data.					; Napiorkowski, Jaroslaw/J-1050-2016	Zhu, Senlin/0000-0003-2803-5419; Napiorkowski, Jaroslaw/0000-0002-0273-4193													0075-9511	1873-5851				MAY	2022	94								125967	10.1016/j.limno.2022.125967	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2022.125967		APR 2022											WOS:000801848100005

Changes in zooplankton biomass in the Bay of Quinte with the arrival of the mussels, Dreissena polymorpha and D-rostiformis bugensis, and the predatory cladoceran, Cercopagis pengoi: 1975 to 2008	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Long term monitoring of Lake Ontario's Bay of Quinte provides the opportunity to examine the impact of dreissenid invasion on the zooplankton community. Weekly or biweekly zooplankton samples have been collected from 1975 to 2008 at 3 stations: Belleville (B), Hay Bay (HB), and Conway (C) along a trophic and depth gradient down the bay. Rotifers have been collected since 2000. Biomass estimates based on measured zooplankton lengths started in 1995. Archived seasonal composite samples prior to 1995 were reanalysed and biomass recalculated from length-weight equations to allow for comparable data in trend analysis. Mean May 1-October 6 zooplankton biomass was low from 1975 into the early 1980s and peaked between 1982-1983 and 1991. Biomass fell during the cold summer of 1992 associated with the Pinatubo eruption and was low after the invasion of dreissenid mussels. From 1979-1991 (after phosphorus control and prior to dreissenid invasion), biomass averaged 265, 253 and 84 mg m(-3) at B, HB and C, respectively. Seasonal biomass of most zooplankton groups, as well as total biomass, was significantly lower at all stations after the dreissenid invasion. Cladocerans still dominated zooplankton biomass after the invasion, averaging 56% to 80% of the total. Cyclopoid numbers and biomass fell dramatically. After the invasion of Cercopagis pengoi in 1999, calanoid and cyclopoid biomass at HB and C decreased by approximately 50%. Bosmina biomass did not change. Seasonal mean rotifer biomass over the 2000 to 2008 period was 1.9% to 4.4% of total zooplankton biomass. Reductions in zooplankton following dreissenid and C. pengoi invasions are thought to be caused by both direct predation of microzooplankton (e.g. nauplii) by mussels and copepods by C. pengoi (at C and HB), and competition between zooplankton and dreissenids for food resources.																			1463-4988						2011	14	1					44	55		10.1080/14634988.2011.550528	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2011.550528													WOS:000288197500006

We measured CH4 emissions from four vegetation stands in newly created marshes in the drawdown area of the Three Gorges Reservoir, China, in the summer of 2008. The results showed highly spatial variations of methane emissions among the four stands, with the smallest emission (0.25 +/- 0.65 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) in the Juncus amuricus stand, and the greatest (14.9 +/- 10.9 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) in the Scirpus triqueter stand. We found that the spatial variations of CH4 emissions are caused by difference in standing water depth and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Results also showed a special seasonal variation of CH4 emissions in this area, i.e., maximal emissions in early July followed by a low and steady value before the winter flooding. The seasonality of CH4 emissions was found closely related to temperature and standing water depth. Because of the large area of the drawdown zones for global dam reservoirs and a large CH4 emission rate, such newly created marshes should not be neglected when estimating CH4 emissions from reservoirs.

There was no trend in total annual precipitation received by the watershed, but the average annual water yield (percentage of annual precipitation) declined over the observation period. The proportion of runoff occurring in different seasons also changed, decreasing in the winter and increasing in the spring. in most streams the concentration of SO42- has decreased coincident with the decline in precipitation inputs. Recovery of the basins from acid deposition (as evidenced by increased pH, increased alkalinity, and decreasing base cation fluxes) has not been uniform. Basins that do not show signs of recovery are characterized by deeper flowpaths and greater potential neutralizing capacity, which minimizes the impacts of acid deposition. Basins that are dominated by shallow flowpaths and lower levels of potential neutralizing capacity are showing some signs of recovery, but their recovery is not complete and it is possible that cation depletion may prevent or retard it.																			1432-9840					SEP	2001	4	6					514	526		10.1007/s10021-001-0025-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-001-0025-0													WOS:000171620400003

The Lake Ice Continuum Concept: Influence of Winter Conditions on Energy and Ecosystem Dynamics	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Millions of lakes worldwide are distributed at latitudes or elevations resulting in the formation of lake ice during winter. Lake ice affects the transfer of energy, heat, light, and material between lakes and their surroundings creating an environment dramatically different from open-water conditions. While this fundamental restructuring leads to distinct gradients in ions, dissolved gases, and nutrients throughout the water column, surprisingly little is known about the resulting effects on ecosystem processes and food webs, highlighting the lack of a general limnological framework that characterizes the structure and function of lakes under a gradient of ice cover. Drawing from the literature and three novel case studies, we present the Lake Ice Continuum Concept (LICC) as a model for understanding how key aspects of the physical, chemical, and ecological structure and function of lakes vary along a continuum of winter climate conditions mediated by ice and snow cover. We examine key differences in energy, redox, and ecological community structure and describe how they vary in response to shifts in physical mixing dynamics and light availability for lakes with ice and snow cover, lakes with clear ice alone, and lakes lacking winter ice altogether. Global change is driving ice covered lakes toward not only warmer annual average temperatures but also reduced, intermittent or no ice cover. The LICC highlights the wide range of responses of lakes to ongoing climate-driven changes in ice cover and serves as a reminder of the need to understand the role of winter in the annual aquatic cycle.					; Lottig, Noah/AAE-4650-2020; Sadro, Steven/AGC-7944-2022; Cotner, James/D-8799-2013; O'Reilly, Catherine/AFZ-5813-2022	O'Reilly, Catherine/0000-0001-9685-3697; Sadro, Steven/0000-0002-6416-3840; Lottig, Noah/0000-0003-1599-8144; Cotner, James/0000-0001-9792-467X; Powers, Stephen/0000-0001-6267-2644; Fournier, Isabelle/0000-0002-0065-2338; Hazukova, Vaclava/0000-0003-2073-221X; Hampton, Stephanie/0000-0003-2389-4249; Berger, Stella A./0000-0002-8835-545X													2169-8953	2169-8961				NOV	2021	126	11							e2020JG006165	10.1029/2020JG006165	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JG006165													WOS:000722469900010
J	Tietjen, TE; Wetzel, RG				Tietjen, TE; Wetzel, RG			Seasonal and spatial distribution of bacterial biomass and the percentage of viable cells in a reservoir of Alabama	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Spatial community dynamics of bacterioplankton were evaluated along the length of the former stream channel of Elledge Lake, a small reservoir in western Alabama. The reservoir was strongly stratified from April to October with up to a 10degreesC temperature difference across the 1 m deep metalimnion. Bacterial biomass was highest during late summer, with a general pattern of increasing abundance from the inflowing river (similar to10 mug C l(-1)) to the dam (similar to20-30 mug C l(-1)). Bacterial numbers also increased following a >10-fold increase in turbidity associated with a major precipitation event, although only similar to10% of these cells were viable. The percentage of viable cells generally increased through the stratified period with 50-70% viable cells in late summer. Overall, an average of 38% of bacterial cells were viable, with a range from <20 to 70%. Although these values were similar to those found by others, additional patterns were identified that have not been previously observed: a marked decline in viable cells was found following turbid storm inflows and increases in the percentage of viable cells occurred during spring warming and following autumnal mixing events. Although a modest increase in abundance occurred along the gradient from inflow down-reservoir to the dam, bacterial abundance did not increase near the dam in a pattern coincident with the commonly observed increased algal biomass in the lacustrine portion of reservoir ecosystems. The increases observed in bacterial viability moving from the inflowing rivers towards the dam and later in stratified periods stress the importance of differences in environmental conditions in time and space in regulating bacterial biomass and development, as well as of shifts that would be anticipated accompanying altered hydrological regimes under climatic change.																			0142-7873					DEC	2003	25	12					1521	1534		10.1093/plankt/fbg113	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbg113													WOS:000187232500007

The typical flow field and the 3-D flow structure are obtained for the lake. The flow fields under extreme conditions are analyzed to provide a prospective knowledge of the water exchange and the transport process.The influence of the wind on the flow is determined by the cross spectrum method. The results show that the wind-driven flow dominates most area of the lake. Under prevailing winds in summer and winter, the water flows towards the downwind side at the upper layer while towards the upwind side at the lower layer in most area except that around the Chaohu Sluice. The extreme wind speed is not favorable for the water exchange while the sluice's releasing water accelerates the process. The water velocity in the lake is closely related with the wind speed.

Biodiversity, distribution and production of macrozoobenthos communities in the saline Chernavka River (Lake Elton basin, South-West Russia)	LIMNOLOGY												The rise of salinity of inland waters in many regions of the world highlights the necessity of investigations of ecosystems with a naturally high level of salinity to be able to predict possible changes in freshwater under the influence of modern environmental hazards. We studied species composition, density, biomass, and estimated production of macrozoobenthos communities in the middle reach and mouth of the saline Chernavka River (Lake Elton basin, Russia) from October 2018 to September 2019. The salinity of the water varied from 24 to 34 g l(-1) during the investigation period. Species richness was poor: only a total of 21 taxa were found during the study period in the Chernavka River. The average density of benthic taxa in the middle reach was 8294 ind. m(-2), and in the river mouth, the average density of benthic taxa was 12,893 ind. m(-2). Chironomid larvae and Ceratopogonid larvae had high density and biomass in both sites throughout the growing season. Beetle larvae had high density in summer and autumn in the mouth of the river. The production of macrozoobenthos in the middle reach was 57.7 g dry wt m(-2) year(-1). In the mouth reach, the production was 707.2 g dry wt m(-2) year(-1). In the middle reach, the greatest contribution to production was made by Palpomyia schmidti, Cricotopus salinophilus, and Ephydra sp. In the mouth reach, Chironomus salinarius, Berosus spp., and C. salinophilus contributed to benthic production the most.

Compared to waterfowl with similar life histories, black scoters (M. nigra) and surf scoters (M. perspicillata), the decline in age ratios of white-winged scoter age ratios was not significantly different (P = 0.11). Adult females banded at Redberry Lake, Saskatchewan that winter along both coasts, had high annual survival rates (0.73 +/- 0.0176 [SE]). High harvest in the Atlantic Flyway was not followed by an increase in production (age ratios) the following year or 2, i.e., there was no short-term rebound in recruitment by the population. Harvest of white-winged scoters in the Atlantic Flyway was explained by the age ratio in the fall night and by hunter effort.																			0022-541X					JAN	1997	61	1					222	227		10.2307/3802431	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3802431													WOS:A1997WL78800023

Disturbances in the form of dramatic summer storms had a crucial effect on phytoplankton succession and its vertical distribution. Two extreme rainfalls substantially increased flushing rate, yielding a fairly short retention time within the reservoir that disrupted established thermal stratification. The first storm initiated the development of summer phytoplankton, while the second storm reversed the phytoplankton succession to an earlier stage. The measurement of vertical profiles of chlorophyll a showed that the phytoplankton were heterogeneously distributed in the water column and formed subsurface diatom maxima (SDM) over most of the summer. Biogenic silica deposition studied by PDMPO (2-(4-pyridyl)-5{[4-dimethylaminoethyl-aminocarbamyl)-methoxy] phenyl}oxazole) was measured to compare diatom growth rates over the season and between surface and depth of SDM. Diatoms deposited 20 times more silica at the surface than at the SDM depth, although only a half of diatom population was involved in the silica deposition. Maximum rates of silica deposition were measured in samples just after both summer storms events. When diatoms dominated the phytoplankton, the amounts of available Si and P in water were significantly correlated (r(2) = 0.81, p < 0.001, df = 42). Outliers from the linear relationship were found only during a period when substantial picocyanobacterial population developed in the reservoir. Due to their lack of Si requirements, ambient Si concentration markedly increased while P was depleted to growth limiting levels. Temporal variations in Si:P ratio therefore illustrate the importance of resource competition in phytoplankton seasonal succession.					; Znachor, Petr/F-8901-2014; Rehakova, Klara/B-2143-2012; Nedoma, Jiri/F-9063-2014; Kozlíková, Eliška/AAD-8558-2021; Šimek, Karel/AAB-1956-2021	Kozlikova, Eliska/0000-0002-2019-5314; Simek, Karel/0000-0002-7058-9063; Rehakova, Klara/0000-0002-8871-9989; 													1015-1621	1420-9055				APR	2008	70	1					77	86		10.1007/s00027-007-7033-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-007-7033-x													WOS:000254755900008

While the conventional Eastern-Pacific El Nino affects winter temperatures primarily over the Great Lakes, Northeast, and Southwest US, the largest impact from Central-Pacific El Nino is on temperatures in the northwestern and southeastern US. The recent shift to a greater frequency of occurrence of the Central-Pacific type has made the Northwest and Southeast regions of the US most influenced by El Nino. It is shown that the different impacts result from differing wave train responses in the atmosphere to the sea surface temperature anomalies associated with the two types of El Nino.

J	Beylich, AA; Laute, K; Storms, JEA				Beylich, Achim A.; Laute, Katja; Storms, Joep E. A.			Contemporary suspended sediment dynamics within two partly glacierized mountain drainage basins in western Norway (Erdalen and Bodalen, inner Nordfjord)	GEOMORPHOLOGY					8th I.A.G./A.I.G. Sediment Budgets in Cold Environments (SEDIBUD)	SEP 01-04, 2014	Environm Res Station Schneefernerhaus, GERMANY	I A G	Environm Res Station Schneefernerhaus			This paper focuses on environmental controls, spatiotemporal variability and rates of contemporary fluvial suspended sediment transport in the neighboring, partly glacierized and steep Erdalen (79.5 km(2)) and Bodalen (60.1 km(2)) drainage basins in the fjord landscape of the inner Nordfjord in western Norway. Fieldwork, including extended samplings and measurements, was conducted since 2004 in Erdalen and since 2008 in Bodalen. The distinct intra- and inter-annual temporal variability of suspended sediment transport found is mostly controlled by meteorological events, with most suspended sediment transport occurring during pluvial events in autumn (September-November), followed by mostly thermally determined glacier melt in summer (July-August), and by mostly thermally determined snowmelt in spring (April-June). Extreme rainfall events (>70 mm d(-1)) in autumn can trigger significant debris-flow activity that can cause significant transfers of suspended sediments from ice-free surface areas with sedimentary covers into main stream channels and is particularly important for fluvial suspended sediment transport. In years with occurring relevant debris-flow activity the total annual drainage basin wide suspended sediment yields are strongly determined by these single extreme events. The proportion of glacier coverage, followed by steepness of slopes, and degree of vegetation cover in ice-free surface areas with sedimentary covers are the main controls for the detected spatial variability of suspended sediment yields. The contemporary sediment supply from glacierized surface areas and the Jostedalsbreen ice cap through different defined outlet glaciers shows a high spatial variability. The fact that the mean annual suspended sediment yield of Bodalen is with 31.3 t km(-2) yr(-1) almost twice as high as the mean annual suspended sediment yield of Erdalen (16.4 t km(-2) yr(-1)) is to a large extent explained by the higher proportion of glacier coverage in Bodalen (38% of the drainage basin surface area) as compared to Erdalen (18% of the drainage basin surface area) and by a significantly higher sediment yield from the glacierized area of the Bodalen drainage basin compared to the glacierized surface area in Erdalen. When looking at the total annual mass of suspended sediments being fluvially exported from both entire drainage basin systems, the total amount of suspended sediments coming from the ice-free drainage basin surface areas altogether dominates over the total amount of suspended sediments coming from the glacierized surface area of both drainage basins. Drainage-basin wide annual suspended sediment yields are rather low when compared with yields of other partly glacierized drainage basin systems in Norway and in other cold climate environments worldwide, which is mainly due to the high resistance of the predominant gneisses towards glacial erosion and weathering, the altogether only small amounts of sediments being available within the entire drainage basin systems, the stable and nearly closed vegetation cover in the ice-free surface areas with sedimentary covers, and the efficiency of proglacial lakes in trapping sediments supplied by defined outlet glaciers. Both contemporary and long-term suspended sediment yields are altogether supply-limited. Contemporary suspended sediment transport accounts for nearly two-thirds of the total fluvial transport and, accordingly, plays an important role within the sedimentary budgets of the entire Erdalen and Bodalen drainage basins.

J	Balboni, L; Colautti, DC; Baigún, CRM				Balboni, Leandro; Cesar Colautti, Dario; Mariano Baigun, Claudio Rafael			Biology of growth of Hoplias aff. malabaricus (Bloch, 1794) in a shallow pampean lake (Argentina)	NEOTROPICAL ICHTHYOLOGY												The trahira Hoplias aff. malabaricus is a top predator in pampean shallow lakes and is highly appreciated by recreational anglers and artisanal fishermen. Trahira growth from Yalca shallow lake was determined by lepidological analysis and age validated by marginal increment. When growth was fitted to the von Bertalanffy model, annual classes exhibited a bimodal pattern as a result of the presence of spring and summer annual cohorts associated with a three month spawning season, each period in turn showing different growth patterns. The trahira population-age structure at Yalca shallow lake showed a truncated profile with very low numbers of large adults and few individuals older than three to four years, thus producing an unbalanced length-structure population. Growth parameters and growth performance were similar to the corresponding parameters estimated for other shallow pampean lakes of the region, but strongly diverged from the data for those populations inhabiting subtropical and tropical environments. Such differences could be accounted for by dissimilarity in metabolic rates associated with thermal differences accompanying seasonal variability among latitudes as well as by the development of adaptive physiologic and demographic responses to cope with the high thermal amplitude and hydrologic instability observed in pampean lakes.					; Colautti, Darío/AAV-4732-2020	Baigun, Claudio/0000-0001-8412-8586; Colautti, Dario/0000-0002-8896-4255													1679-6225					APR-JUN	2011	9	2					437	444		10.1590/S1679-62252011000200022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1679-62252011000200022													WOS:000292915000022

Hydro-climatological variability in Lagunas de Vilama System, Argentinean Altiplano-Puna Plateau, Southern Tropical Andes (22° S) and its response to large-scale climate forcings	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The Altiplano-Puna Plateau holds several shallow lakes, which are very sensitive to climate changes. This work is focused on a high-altitude lake system called Lagunas de Vilama (LVS), located in a complex climatic transition area with scarcity of continuous and homogeneous instrumental records. The objective of this study is to determine the regional spatial-temporal variability of precipitation and evaluate the seasonal and interannual lake responses. We use a lake-surfaces record derived from Landsat images to investigate links with regional precipitations and different climatic forcings. The results reveal that austral summer and autumn precipitations control the variability of the annual lake-surfaces. Also, we found intra-annual and interannual lags in the lake responses to precipitations, and identified several wet and dry stages. Our results show negative trends in precipitations and lake-surfaces, whose were strengthened by a shift to a warm phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation in the 1990s. The El Nino Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and Southern Annular Mode also exert a strong influence in the region. This study demonstrates that the variability of LVS lakes is strongly related to the South American Monsoon System dynamics and large-scale climate fordngs from the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. This work provides novel indices which demonstrated to be good indicators of regional hydroclimatological variability for this region of South America. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

J	Zou, JY; Yang, YS; Zhang, HY				Zou, Junyu; Yang, Yuesuo; Zhang, Haiyan			Sr isotope fingerprinting of multiple water-source characterizations and its environmental implications in a complex lake-groundwater system, Wudalianchi, Northeast China	CHEMOSPHERE												The Wudalianchi UNESCO Global Geopark (Northeast China) is famous for its rare cold mineral springs and its associated five hydrologically connected barrier lakes. During this study, strontium (Sr) isotopes (Sr-87/Sr-86) were studied along with other geochemical data to determine the source of water within the region's deep and shallow mineral springs, shallow wells, and lakes. These waters were characterized by a relatively narrow range of Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.70648-0.70816). Those ratios were not different in shallow and deep mineral spring waters, and probably reflect ratios associated with potassium volcanic rocks in the area as expected. When combined with 1/Sr ratios, it appears that the shallow mineral springs were derived from upwelling of deep mineral springs and had a composition as an endmember of other waters. Shallow mineral springs and wells exhibited large variations in Cl-/Sr2+ and NO3-/Sr2+ ratios, owing to the input of fertilizers. Farmland runoff and waters from Yaoquan Lake that drains an agricultural area also appear to have been influenced by fertilizers and showed Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios intermediate between wells and mineral springs. Sewage input is likely responsible for this difference and a slight elevation of the ratios in the wells. The Wudalianchi lakes had similar variations in Sr-87/(86S)r and 1/Sr ratios, suggesting their rapid response to terrestrial runoff and the supply of shallow mineral springs. Strontium isotope data can be combined with water chemistry to emphasize water-rock interaction and refine the region's existing model of water interaction in surface and subsurface environments.

In this study, we developed an ecologically-based approach to estimate the monthly suitable ecological water levels (EWLs). This approach took both the lake topographic features and aquatic plants' growth characteristics into account. The aquatic vegetation coverage was used to characterize the degree of the lake ecological restoration. The relationship between water level and vegetation coverage was established. We chose the Tangxun Lake as a testbed, and the recommended lowest EWL was 16.6m, as the minimum threshold for water level regulations. The results revealed that the predicted vegetation coverage decreased with the rise of water level during the germination period (February and March). To achieve the vegetation coverage goal of 30% and 50%, the lake's water levels must be lowered to 17.1m and 16.8m respectively during germination. The EWLs were recommended to be low in spring and high in summer, which was matched with the natural water level regimes. The proposed approach can provide a reliable reference for water level regulation of shallow lakes especially the lakes with insufficient data.					李, 瑞卿/HHZ-7920-2022; Xu, Ming-Hua/AFW-3685-2022														2045-2322					MAR 27	2020	10	1							5637	10.1038/s41598-020-62454-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-62454-5								32221357					WOS:000560408800016

Deviations from these trends during 1977 and 1983-84 were apparently caused by abiotic and biotic factors, respectively. Prolonged ice cover during 1977 decreased sediment resuspension resulting in lower TP, reduced Chl a levels, and increased water clarity. A similar dramatic result occurred in 1983 and to a lesser extent in 1984, but via a different mechanism. Burgeoning populations of stocked salmonines reduced populations of the planktivorous alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), which allowed large Daphnia to flourish. Because the Daphnia are more voracious and nonselective grazers than the formerly dominant calanoid copepods, they reduced seston concentratons, causing dramatic increases in Secchi disk transparency. These exceptions demonstrate the far-reaching consequences that unusual weather conditions and fish management practices may have on water quality indicators.

Four desert waters: Setting arid zone wetland conservation priorities through understanding patterns of endemism	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Long-lasting surface water in arid-lands provide oases for aquatic biota, but their values as biological refugia have rarely been assessed. This study identified and mapped permanent natural wetlands across the Eastern Lake Eyre Basin in Australia and classified them into four types: riverine waterholes, rockholes, discharge springs and outcrop springs. Waterholes are the most widespread and numerous source of lasting water, while springs and rockholes are confined to relatively discrete clusters. The characteristics of each wetland type are summarised, and their biological values compared by examining various scales of endemism for vascular plant, fish and mollusc species. Discharge springs contain an exceptional concentration of endemic species across all three lifeforms at a range of scales. Waterholes are critical drought refugia for native fish species that also utilise a vast network of ephemeral streams during and after floods. Rockholes and outcrop springs do not contain any known specialised endemics, although the latter have disjunct populations of some plants and fish. The existing knowledge of antiquity, connectivity and habitat differentiation of the wetland types is compiled and their role in determining biological endemism is discussed. Exotic fish are a major conservation issue, the recovery of the discharge springs should be paramount, and the intact network of permanent waterholes should be preserved. A focus on endemism, combined with an understanding of the biogeographical processes underlying the observed patterns provides an effective and systematic approach to setting priorities for regional biodiversity conservation.

S	van Dijk, D		Fisher, TG; Hansen, EC		van Dijk, Deanna			Short- and long-term perspectives on the evolution of a Lake Michigan foredune	COASTLINE AND DUNE EVOLUTION ALONG THE GREAT LAKES	Geological Society of America Special Papers											The evolution of Great Lakes coastal dunes includes long-term trends and short-term variations. This study explores multi-year, interannual and seasonal patterns of change as a Lake Michigan foredune responds to variations in lake level, weather and surface conditions. The study site is an active foredune in P.J. Hoffmaster State Park on the east coast of Lake Michigan. Foredune changes, local conditions and processes were monitored from 2000 to 2012 with repeated ground surveys, erosion pins, microclimate measurements, and observations of surface conditions. Additional weather and lake-level data were obtained from regional sources. Study results show a trend of foredune growth during the multiyear study period, with interannual and seasonal variations in the rates and spatial patterns of dune growth. At the scales of investigation, relationships between dune change and variables could not be quantified, but patterns of foredune change and influential variables were identified. The greatest amounts of erosion and deposition took place during the autumn and winter when strong winds were the most frequent, but storm conditions, vegetation changes, precipitation, snow, and ground freezing affect the availability of sand for transport by wind. Study results suggest that event-scale research is needed for understanding interactions between variables and the foredune, but mesoscale studies such as this one are crucial for identifying cumulative patterns of dune change and the role that events play in the larger scale patterns of dune evolution.																			0072-1077		978-0-8137-2508-6				2014	508						195	216		10.1130/2014.2508(11)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2014.2508(11)	10.1130/9780813725086												WOS:000342837200012

Newly hatched larvae of this species were active and fully developed but were not found in the adult habitat until 6 mo. after spawning. P. eleotroides also matured at 1 yr old but spawned in spring. Egg numbers ranged from 44-149 but the spawning site of this species was not found. No large influx of juvenile P. eleotroides was detected. Length-and weight-frequency histograms of P. dissimilis are figured and length-weight relationships of all 4 spp. are given. The diet of P. dissimilis varied seasonally as well as between different size groups. Differences in diet also occurred between P. dissimilis and P. eleotroides.																			0067-1940						1982	33	6					999	1016																WOS:A1982PU41800005

Exemplifying this are expansive under-ice blooms of filamentous diatoms in Lake Erie. Here we describe a metatranscriptome constructed from a phytoplankton community dominated by filamentous diatoms. As expected, a high percentage (>73%) of the sequences with BLAST hits to nucleotides or proteins in National Center for Biotechnology Information databases were associated with photosynthetic algae of which the majority were diatoms, mainly Aulacoseira spp. and Stephanodiscus spp. which was confirmed by analysis of 18S rRNA gene transcripts and microscopy. Consistent with the winter growth environment, psychrophilic and low light adaptations were observed. Prominent among adaptations to cold were transcripts for genes involved in biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, which were consistent with expected increased membrane fluidity at low temperatures. Reflecting the combined effect of low winter insolation and high light attenuation were an abundant complement of reads for light-harvesting antennae, mainly genes encoding fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c proteins. The presence of virulence factors originating from oomycetes offers support for new hypotheses into the eventual decline of Lake Erie's winter diatom bloom. Whereas fungi were identified both through the metatranscriptome and by microscopy, dsRNA viruses of fungi were detected that may indirectly counter against fungal infection. This study demonstrates the utility of an environmental omics approach to yield insights underlying phototrophic life as well as the interactions of the entire microbial community in an extreme environment.

J	GELLER, W				GELLER, W			THE ENERGY BUDGET OF 2 SYMPATRIC DAPHNIA SPECIES IN LAKE CONSTANCE - PRODUCTIVITY AND ENERGY RESIDENCE TIMES	OECOLOGIA												Two Daphnia species, D. hyalina and D. galeata, are living in Lake Constance. Both populations show logistic growth, with the phase of exponential increase in May and the phase of steady state during the summer. In spring, food is not limited and both daphnids reveal an ''exploitative'' strategy: females mature early, primiparae are small, egg weights are small, but clutch sizes are large. From June on, when food limiting conditions prevail, D. hyalina starts to migrate vertically with a diurnal rhythm whereas D. galeata keeps on living in the epilimnion over the whole season. The differing thermal environments of the populations lead to short generation times (age of first reproduction) of 11 days to D. galeata in mid-summer, and to 47 days (July) for D. hyalina. The annual production (P) of D. hyalina and D. galeata were 18 and 24 g DW/m2, respectively. The average standing stocks (B) were 1.6 and 0.9 g DW/m2. This corresponds to turnover rates of 11 .times. and 27 .times. per season (200 days), and to turnover times of 18 days and 7.5 days, respectively. From 1980 to 1982 the cumulative annual primary production (PPR) varied between 260 and 330 g C/m2. The common productivity (P) of the functional component ''Daphnia'' (= sum of both Daphnia species) followed the PPR, but the Daphnia standing stock was constant at 2.5 g DW/m2. The increase of secondary production (P) was a consequence of a shift in abundance between the two Daphnia species: at low PPR, D. hyalina was 4 .times. more abundant, but at high PPR, the two species were equally abundant. Such internal regulatory mechanism within a system component is in accordance with the hypothesis of Cheslak and Lamarra (1981): increase of ''energy residence time'' (B/R) with declining nutrients and increasing strength of competitive interrelationships within a given functional component of an ecosystem.																			0029-8549	1432-1939					1989	78	2					242	250		10.1007/BF00377162	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00377162								28312365					WOS:A1989T021900013
J	Tirok, K; Gaedke, U				Tirok, Katrin; Gaedke, Ursula			The effect of irradiance, vertical mixing and temperature on spring phytoplankton dynamics under climate change: long-term observations and model analysis	OECOLOGIA												Spring algal development in deep temperate lakes is thought to be strongly influenced by surface irradiance, vertical mixing and temperature, all of which are expected to be altered by climate change. Based on long-term data from Lake Constance, we investigated the individual and combined effects of these variables on algal dynamics using descriptive statistics, multiple regression models and a process-oriented dynamic simulation model. The latter considered edible and less-edible algae and was forced by observed or anticipated irradiance, temperature and vertical mixing intensity. Unexpectedly, irradiance often dominated algal net growth rather than vertical mixing for the following reason: algal dynamics depended on algal net losses from the euphotic layer to larger depth due to vertical mixing. These losses strongly depended on the vertical algal gradient which, in turn, was determined by the mixing intensity during the previous days, thereby introducing a memory effect. This observation implied that during intense mixing that had already reduced the vertical algal gradient, net losses due to mixing were small. Consequently, even in deep Lake Constance, the reduction in primary production due to low light was often more influential than the net losses due to mixing. In the regression model, the dynamics of small, fast-growing algae was best explained by vertical mixing intensity and global irradiance, whereas those of larger algae were best explained by their biomass 1 week earlier. The simulation model additionally revealed that even in late winter grazing may represent an important loss factor during calm periods when losses due to mixing are small. The importance of losses by mixing and grazing changed rapidly as it depended on the variable mixing intensity. Higher temperature, lower global irradiance and enhanced mixing generated lower algal biomass and primary production in the dynamic simulation model. This suggests that potential consequences of climate change may partly counteract each other.																			0029-8549					JAN	2007	150	4					625	642		10.1007/s00442-006-0547-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-006-0547-4								16977461					WOS:000243002900009

Classification of freshwater ice conditions on the Alaskan Arctic Coastal Plain using ground penetrating radar and TerraSAR-X satellite data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Arctic freshwater ecosystems have responded rapidly to climatic changes over the last half century. Lakes and rivers are experiencing a thinning of the seasonal ice cover, which may increase potential over-wintering freshwater habitat, winter water supply for industrial withdrawal, and permafrost degradation. Here, we combined the use of ground penetrating radar (GPR) and high-resolution (HR) spotlight TerraSAR-X (TSX) satellite data (1.25m resolution) to identify and characterize floating ice and grounded ice conditions in lakes, ponds, beaded stream pools, and an alluvial river channel. Classified ice conditions from the GPR and the TSX data showed excellent agreement: 90.6% for a predominantly floating ice lake, 99.7% for a grounded ice lake, 79.0% for a beaded stream course, and 92.1% for the alluvial river channel. A GIS-based analysis of 890 surface water features larger than 0.01ha showed that 42% of the total surface water area potentially provided over-wintering habitat during the 2012/2013 winter. Lakes accounted for 89% of this area, whereas the alluvial river channel accounted for 10% and ponds and beaded stream pools each accounted for <1%. Identification of smaller landscape features such as beaded stream pools may be important because of their distribution and role in connecting other water bodies on the landscape. These findings advance techniques for detecting and knowledge associated with potential winter habitat distribution for fish and invertebrates at the local scale in a region of the Arctic with increasing stressors related to climate and land use change.					; Grosse, Guido/F-5018-2011	Gaglioti, Benjamin/0000-0003-0591-5253; Arp, Christopher/0000-0002-6485-6225; Gusmeroli, Alessio/0000-0002-8355-5591; Jones, Benjamin/0000-0002-1517-4711; Grosse, Guido/0000-0001-5895-2141													0143-1161	1366-5901				DEC 10	2013	34	23					8267	8279		10.1080/2150704X.2013.834392	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2013.834392													WOS:000325515500001
J	Roychoudhury, AN				Roychoudhury, AN			Sulfate respiration in extreme environments: A kinetic study	GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL												In situ experiments were conducted in order to quantify sulfate reduction kinetics among thermophilic prokaryotes thriving in hydrothermal springs of Yellowstone National Park ( USA). Selected springs were sampled based on their varied physicochemical characteristics in order to identify the effect of extreme environmental determinants over sulfate reduction. Reduction rates range from 1 to 483 nmol cm(-3) d(-1) in various springs with no correlation observed between sulfate reduction rate and pH or sulfate concentration of spring waters. A weak negative correlation with temperature exists though. Results from slurry incubation experiments show that both the apparent activation energy and the half- saturation constant are site specific. Activation energies of 17, 38, and 119 kJ mol(-1) were determined in three different springs whereas the half- saturation constant values of 1.24 +/- 0.90 and 3.17 +/- 1.02 mM were calculated for two of the sampled springs. Such variations in activity and kinetic parameters may depict a change in the microbial population in different springs, or the response of microbial assemblages to changing physicochemical conditions. In the latter case the sulfate reducers must be highly adaptive to changing environmental conditions.

Density, Salinity, and Entry Depths of Municipal Wastewater in an Urban Lake	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												The depths of entry of municipal wastewater into receiving lakes importantly affects associated impacts on water quality. The plunging behavior of two negatively buoyant inflows that carry municipal waste, an urban tributary and an effluent discharge, in Onondaga Lake, NY, is characterized and quantified based on an integrated program of monitoring, density calculations, and modeling. In-lake signatures of plunging from the two inflows are differentiated according to constituents in which each is enriched. Under common contemporary conditions, the summer averages of the fraction of the urban stream and effluent discharge inflows plunging to stratified depths is predicted, with a calibrated hydrodynamic model, to be approximately 0.7 and 0.35, respectively. Recent short-term increases in salinity levels from construction site dewatering caused greater plunging of the effluent discharge and interfered with normal complete fall turnover in the lake.

J	LOMOLINO, MV				LOMOLINO, MV			WINTER FILTERING, IMMIGRANT SELECTION AND SPECIES COMPOSITION OF INSULAR MAMMALS OF LAKE HURON	ECOGRAPHY												Patterns in species composition of small mammals on islands of northwestern Lake Huron, USA, were studied to test the hypothesis that insular community structure was strongly influenced by immigrant selection; i.e., selection for the more vagile species. Of 17 insectivores and rodents in the mainland pool, nine were detected on at least one of the 25 islands studied. These species comprised a biased subset of the mainland pool, biased in favor of species with relatively good winter immigration abilities. The five true hibernators were absent from all islands studied, and the two winter-inactive species occurred on just two islands. Frequency of insular occurrence increased with level of winter activity (hibernator vs winter-inactive vs winter-active) and with body size (p < 0.02). The winter filtering effect remains one of the best documented forms of immigrant selection. In general. however, insular community structure is influenced by the combined effects of selective extinction as well as selective immigration. Common insular species are those which combine relatively high immigration abilities with low resource requirements.																			0906-7590	1600-0587				JAN-MAR	1993	16	1					24	30		10.1111/j.1600-0587.1993.tb00055.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.1993.tb00055.x													WOS:A1993KP39100004

Allometric growth and reproductive biology traits of pikeperch Sander lucioperca at the southern edge of its range	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												This study describes some biological traits (allometric relationship, reproductive biology and condition factor) of pikeperch Sander lucioperca at the southern edge of its range. Data were compiled from field studies between January 1997 and January 2009 in three Tunisian reservoirs. Overall, 1497 fish were caught, from which 1308 specimens were sampled and dissected. Sexually undetermined, male and female fish from the different sites exhibited similar allometric growth, expressed through the equation M-T = 5 x 10-6 L(T)3 center dot 06, where M-T is the total mass and L-T is the total length. The exponent value is slightly but significantly greater than 3, indicating positive allometric growth. Sex ratio (males:females) was 47:53 but remained balanced only up to 55 cm L-T and changed with increasing size towards female dominance. Spawning occurred in March and early April according to the changes in female size-adjusted gonad mass or corresponding gonado-somatic index (I-G) values. Thermal conditions seemed favourable in February, but March corresponded to the period of equal day and night lengths and the switch towards longer days in terms of photoperiod. Changes in both size-adjusted M-T or Fulton's condition factor and size-adjusted liver mass or hepato-somatic index (I-H) were clearly associated with reproduction. Reserves were consumed during spring in association with spawning efforts. Nevertheless, the delay before the reconstitution of reserves seemed relatively long (from early spring to late summer) although both thermal and trophic conditions could be considered favourable for active feeding of the fish.

Almost all of the species identified exhibit cosmopolitan distributions - at least in the Holarctic region. The presence of Scottia pseudobrowniana represents the second recording of this species in the ostracod fauna of Turkey. The dominant taxa in both springs was Cy. ophthalmica, I. bradyi, Pr. zenkeri and Ca. neglecta. Correlation analyses suggested a significant positive relationship in relative abundance between I. bradyi, Pr. zenkeri and Cy. ophthalmica. Species composition differed significantly between the upper and lower study sites for each spring, but differences could not be detected between sites at the same elevation across sites. Environmental tolerance index (ETI) values suggest that species with high optima and tolerance ranges show cosmopolitan characteristics.

J	Bright, DI; Walsby, AE				Bright, DI; Walsby, AE			The daily integral of growth by Planktothrix rubescens calculated from growth rate in culture and irradiance in Lake Zurich	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												In Lake Zurich, populations of the cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens develop in the metalimnion during the summer and become gradually entrained in the deepening surface mixed layer during the autumn. It had previously been demonstrated that the daily integrals of photosynthetic production accounted for the growth observed in the metalimnion and greatly exceeded the smaller increase during the autumn. We have now determined the relationship between growth rate (mu) and irradiance (I) in cultures of P. rubescens strain Pla 9316 maintained at 20 degrees C on a 12:12 h light:dark cycle: the highest net growth rate averaged over the 24 h (mu(h)) was 0.123 d(-1), the dark rate (mu(D)) was -0.020 d(-1), the gross rate (phi(m) = mu(h)-mu(D)) was 0.144 d(-1), the affinity coefficient (alpha) was 0.0273 (d mu mol m(-2) s(-1))(-1) and the compensation point (I-C) was 1.76 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Using the corresponding coefficients calculated for the light period (mu(Lh) = 0.267 d(-1), phi(Lm) = 0.287 d(-1) and alpha(L) = 0.0547 (d mu mol m(-2) s(-1))(-1)), instantaneous growth rates could be calculated from the irradiance. Comparison with growth rates at 10 degrees C indicated a Q(10) of 1.48. These coefficients were used in a modification of the Smith equation to calculate potential growth rates of Planktothrix from the irradiance and temperature at each time and depth in Lake Zurich. Data on irradiance, vertical light attenuation and temperature were used to calculate the daily integrals of biomass increase over a period of 136 d. These growth integrals gave a closer correspondence to the observed population increase than the photosynthetic integrals calculated previously from measurements made with lakewater samples dominated by Planktothrix. Photosynthetic measurements made with the Planktothrix culture indicated a maximum rate of carbon increase (0.467 d(-1)) that exceeds the maximum growth rate, which suggests that other factors limit growth over long periods.																			0028-646X					MAY	2000	146	2					301	316		10.1046/j.1469-8137.2000.00640.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1469-8137.2000.00640.x								33862979					WOS:000087544700013

During the Younger Dryas a cirque glacier deposited a large outer and a smaller inner moraine in a cirque at the site and melt-water entered a small lake depositing glaciolacustrine sediments. The glaciolacustrine succession can be divided into three sub-units corresponding to the advance, the still-stand and the retreat phases of the glacier. The sediment succession contains both varves and other types of rhythmites, the latter being mainly deposited as turbidity underflows caused by localized slumping events. Lee-side accumulation of snow by wind and avalanching into the cirque was crucial to form and maintain the cirque glacier once summer temperatures were low enough. At maximum, the glacier likely was in equilibrium with climate. The initial retreat from the maximum position might have been triggered by fall-out of volcanic ash from Iceland, but the continued retreat was due to increased ablation season temperatures. The most rapid change in climate at the Younger Dryas/Preboreal transition occurred after the cirque glacier had melted away completely.																			0921-2728					JAN	2004	31	1					49	61		10.1023/B:JOPL.0000013282.14240.e5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:JOPL.0000013282.14240.e5													WOS:000188423700005

Depletion of dissolved oxygen (O-2) in the deep layer (hypolimnion) of lakes during stratification and its deleterious effect on fish stocks have been observed and analyzed for more than 100years. Although it has taken only 60years for humans to turn many freshwater lakes eutrophic, studies estimate that their recovery may take 1,000years under the best circumstances. In deeper (thermally stratified) lakes, the stabilization can involve several factors, including biogeochemistry of the deep layer of water (hypolimnion), temperature of the hypolimnion, shape of the lake basin, abundance of rooted plants, and food web structure. The main purpose of this study was to show the efficiency of hypolimnetic aeration process on the preservation of the thermal stratification, the increasing the amount of oxygen dissolved, and the reduction in phosphorus in the depths of the lake. The 10.3km(2) of the water of Hallwil Lake is an important tourist center for the Canton Aargau (Switzerland). In fact, fishing and water sports are practiced. Before its restoration in the winter of the year 1985/1986, this lake's eutrophication showed significant disruption of aquatic activities, and pollution damage due to its various uses, and thus inhibited the development of tourism in the region. In order to address the eutrophication of Hallwil Lake, the Canton Aargau put into service in the winter of 1985/1986, an installation of a aeration system in two alternate modes of aeration namely by a aeration system in winter destratification and aeration hypolimnetic in summer (air/pure oxygen). As a result, the values of the concentrations of dissolved oxygen during the aeration are as follows: [O-2](min)4.5g/m(3) in the spatial variation and 5g/m(3) in the temporal variation. Also, the heating of the hypolimnion has not attained the thermocline, and as a result, the thermal stratification is preserved.																			1944-3994	1944-3986				MAR 15	2016	57	13					6017	6023		10.1080/19443994.2014.998293	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19443994.2014.998293													WOS:000368690300035

However, few studies explicitly consider the effect of food web structure, e.g. food chain length (FCL), and most studies have focused on temperate systems. We investigated the effect of vernal warming on the spring phenology of a key herbivore, Daphnia galeata (hereafter Daphnia), and its prey, phytoplankton, in subtropical shallow aquatic mesocosms in the presence and absence of the planktivorous fish Aristichthys nobilis, simulating food chains with two or three trophic levels. The warming effect on the timing of the spring phytoplankton peak varied with the FCL. Warming led to the disappearance of the phytoplankton peak in the 2-level systems but resulted in an extensive, delayed phytoplankton peak in the 3-level systems. Irrespective of the FCL, warming did not significantly advance the timing of the Daphnia peak, although Daphnia recruited earlier under warm conditions. Both warming and FCL significantly reduced the size of the Daphnia peak. Our study suggests that spring warming affects the plankton spring phenology in subtropical shallow lakes, but the response patterns depend on the food web structure.

J	Visconti, A; Manca, M				Visconti, Anna; Manca, Marina			Seasonal changes in the δ13C and δ15N signatures of the Lago Maggiore pelagic food web	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Seasonal variation in the relative contributions of littoral and pelagic food sources to the diets of open-water zooplankton and subsequent changes in their trophic positions were investigated with carbon and nitrogen Stable Isotope Analysis (SIA). We selected three open water stations as truly pelagic. but also influenced by littoral and riverine carbon sources. During each of the four seasons, integrated pelagic zooplankton samples were collected over 0-50 m depth intervals at each site along with seston in the size range 1.2-76 mu m. In addition, vertical temperature profiles were measured. Littoral benthos from three sites along the main longitudinal axis of the lake was sampled to serve as a reference for tracing Lago Maggiores littoral carbon isotopic signature. Among stations differences in delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures of the different components of the pelagic food web, from seston to predatory zooplankton, were statistically non significant, thus confirming that allochthonous input may become important only after exceptional rainfall events. Changes in the delta C-13 pelagic baseline mirrored Mean water temperature (0-50 m) seasonal changes. Similarly to Lake Geneva, they were likely driven by changes in carbon sources for phytoplankton growth during stratification and vertical water mixing. Differently from what observed fir the other taxa, the role of littoral food sources was far from negligible (>50%) for diaptomids during winter and spring. We do not know however, whether such a result could be at least partially attributed to the heavy infestation by algal epibionts. or was consequent to the fact that these zooplankters may carry littoral carbon to the pelagial via horizontal migration. In winter, Bythotrephes longimanus was able to prey on Cyclops, thus occupying a trophic position comparable to that of planktivorous fish. Such a result confirms an ability of this visual, invertebrate predator to compete with young zooplanktivorous fish for food resources, similarly to what observed in lakes it recently invaded.																			1129-5767	1723-8633					2011	70	2					263	271		10.4081/jlimnol.2011.263	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2011.263													WOS:000294320400012

The 16-year records of 35 dust-trap sites in the eastern Mojave Desert and southern Great Basin reveal how generation and accumulation of dust, including the silt-clay, carbonate, and soluble-salt fractions, is affected by the amount and seasonal distribution of rainfall and the behavior of different source types (alluvium, dry playas, and wet playas). Accumulation rates (fluxes) of the silt-clay fraction of dust, including carbonates, range from about 2-20 g/m(2)/yr. Average rates are higher in the southern part of the study area (south of latitude 36.5 degrees N) and annually fluctuate over a larger range than rates in the northern part of the area. Sites throughout the study area show peaks in dust flux in the 1984-1985 sampling period and again in 1997-1999; northern sites also show increased flux in 1987-1988 and southern sites in 1989-1991. These peaks of dust flux correspond with both La Nina (dry) conditions and with strong El Nino (wet) periods. The accumulation rates of different components of mineral dusts fluctuate differently. For example, soluble-salt flux increases in 1987-1988, coincident with a moderate El Nino event, and increases very strongly in 1997-1999, overlapping with a strong El Nino event. Both of these high-rainfall winters were preceded and accompanied by strong summer rains. In contrast, little or no change in soluble-salt flux occurred during other periods of high winter rainfall but little Summer rain, e.g. 1992-1995. The differences between northern vs. southern sites and between sites with playa dust sources vs. alluvial dust sources indicate that regional differences in the response of precipitation and vegetation growth to ENSO influence and differences in the response of source types control dust production and accumulation. A major factor is the hydrologic condition of surface sediments. The silt-clay and soluble-salt fluxes increased during the El Nino events of 1987-1988 and 1997-1998 at sites close to "wet" playas with shallow depths to groundwater (< 10 m), consistent with the concept that active evaporative concentration of salts disrupts surface crusts and increases the susceptibility of surface sediment to deflation. The silt-clay flux also increased during drought periods (1989-1991, 1995-1997) at sites downwind of alluvial sources and "dry" playas with deeper groundwater (< 10 m). These increases are probably related to the die-off of drought-stressed vegetation on alluvial sediments, and in some cases to local runoff events that deliver fresh sediment to playa margins and distal portions of alluvial fans.

J	Jones, B; Peng, XT				Jones, Brian; Peng, Xiaotong			Growth and development of spring towers at Shiqiang, Yunnan Province, China	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Throughout the world, high artesian pressures in hydrothermal areas have led to the growth of tall spring towers that have their vents at their summits. The factors that control their development and formative precipitates are poorly understood because these springs, irrespective of location, are mostly inactive. Spring towers found at Shiqiang (Yunnan Province, China), which are up to 4 m high and 3 m in diameter, are formed largely of calcite and aragonite crystal bushes, euhedral calcite crystals and coated grains with alternating Fe-poor and Fe-rich zones, calcite rafts, and cements formed of various combinations of calcite, aragonite, strontianite, Mg-Si reticulate, needle fiber calcite, calcified and non-calcified microbes, diatoms, and insects. Collectively, the limestones that form the towers can be divided into (1) Group A that are friable, porous and form the cores of the towers and have delta O-18(SMOW) values of +15.7 to +19.7 parts per thousand. (average 173 parts per thousand) and delta C-13(PDB) values of +5.1 to +6.9 parts per thousand (average 5.9 parts per thousand), and (2) Group B that are hard and well lithified and found largely around the vents and the tower sides, and have delta O-18(SMOW) values of +13.0 to +22.0 parts per thousand (average 17.6 parts per thousand) and delta C-13(PDB) values of +1.4 to +3.6 parts per thousand (average 2.6 parts per thousand). The precipitates and the isotopic values indicate that these were thermogene springs. Growth of the Shiqiang spring towers involved (1) Phase IA when precipitation of calcite and aragonite bushes formed the core of the tower and Phase IB when calcite, commonly Fe-rich, was precipitated locally, (2) Phase II that involved the precipitation of white cements, formed of calcite, aragonite, strontianite, and Mg-Si reticulate coatings in cavities amid the Phase I precipitates, and (3) Phase III, which formed probably after spring activity ceased, when needle-fiber calcite was precipitated and the mounds were invaded by microbes (some now calcified), diatoms, and insects. At various times during this complex history, pore waters mediated dissolution of the calcite and aragonite and sometimes partial alteration of the aragonite. The diverse array of precipitates, depositional fabrics and diagenetic changes clearly indicate that the composition of the spring water changed frequently. Growth of the spring towers at Shiqiang continued until there was insufficient artesian pressure to lift the water above the top of the tower vent. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, it remains uncertain how these changes will impact the structure of downstream resident freshwater microbial communities and ensuing microbially driven freshwater ecosystem services. Using the Lake Hazen watershed (Nunavut, Canada; 82 degrees N, 71 degrees W) as a sentinel system, we related microbial community composition (16S rRNA gene sequencing) to physicochemical parameters (e.g. dissolved oxygen and nutrients) over an annual hydrological cycle in three freshwater compartments within the watershed: (i) glacial rivers; (ii) active layer thaw-fed streams and waterbodies and (iii) Lake Hazen, into which (i) and (ii) drain. Microbial communities throughout these freshwater compartments were strongly interconnected, hydrologically, and often correlated with the presence of melt-sourced chemicals (e.g. dissolved inorganic carbon) as the melt season progressed. Within Lake Hazen itself, water column microbial communities were generally stable over spring and summer, despite fluctuating lake physicochemistry, indicating that these communities and the potential ecosystem services they provide therein may be resilient to environmental change. This work helps to establish a baseline understanding of how microbial communities and the ecosystem services they provide in Arctic watersheds might respond to future climate change.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the warm summer 2015 on emergency hospital admissions (EHA) in Switzerland. The summer 2015 ranks as the second hottest after 2003 in the history of temperature observation in Switzerland. Methods Daily counts of EHA for various disease categories during summer 2015 were analyzed in relation to previous summers in Switzerland. Excess EHA for non-external causes during summer 2015 (June-August) were estimated by age group, gender, geographic region and disease category by comparing observed and expected cases. The latter were predicted from strata-specific quasi-Poisson regression models fitted to the daily counts of EHA for years 2012-2014. Results Over the three summer months in 2015, an estimated 2.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-3.2%) increase in EHA (non-external causes) occurred corresponding to 2,768 excess cases. Highest excess EHA estimates were found in the warmest regions (Ticino [8.4%, 95% CI 5.1-11.7%] and the Lake Geneva region [4.8%, 95% CI 3.0-6.7%]) and among the elderly population aged >= 75 years (5.1%, 95% CI 3.7-6.5%). Increased EHA during days with most extreme temperatures were observed for influenza and pneumonia, certain infectious diseases and diseases of the genitourinary system. Conclusions Summer 2015 had a considerable impact on EHA in Switzerland. The daily number of EHA mainly increased due to diseases not commonly linked to heat-related mortality. No excess morbidity was found for cardiovascular and most respiratory diseases. This suggests that current public health interventions should be reevaluated to prevent both heat-related illness and deaths.

J	Fu, W; Steinschneider, S				Fu, Wang; Steinschneider, Scott			A Diagnostic-Predictive Assessment of Winter Precipitation over the Laurentian Great Lakes: Effects of ENSO and Other Teleconnections	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												This study examines the primary atmospheric controls over winter precipitation variability in the Great Lakes basin and the potential for seasonal prediction. We employ partial least squares (PLS) regression to identify the primary modes of joint variability between winter precipitation over each of the Great Lakes and concurrent anomalies in midlevel atmospheric flow. We find that the first identified pattern (PLS1) is related to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), while the other patterns represent unique anomalies in atmospheric flow that govern precipitation gradients over the basin, with limited seasonal predictability. Nonlinearities are found in the relationship between a sea surface temperature (SST)-based index for ENSO and PLS1 with respect to the phase, strength, and type of ENSO event. An examination of the ENSO-related propagating wave train that drives variability of PLS1 precipitation reveals that seasonally lagged tropical Pacific convection, as measured by remotely sensed outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), is more strongly and linearly related to Great Lakes winter precipitation than SST-based ENSO indices. Cross-validated linear regressions based on October OLR signals explain 20%-32% of the out-of-sample precipitation variability in the Great Lakes basin. We conclude with a deeper assessment of the underlying relationship between patterns of OLR anomalies in the western equatorial Pacific and Great Lakes winter precipitation. Results show that precipitation response to El Nino is similar regardless of OLR intensity in the tropical Pacific, but for La Nina events, the precipitation response is stronger under weak tropical OLR anomalies. The potential for further improvements in ENSO-based seasonal forecasts are discussed.					; Wang, Fu/F-1529-2017	Steinschneider, Scott/0000-0002-8882-1908; 													1525-755X	1525-7541				JAN	2019	20	1					117	137		10.1175/JHM-D-18-0128.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-18-0128.1													WOS:000457318400001

Hydrological thresholds and basin control over paleoflood records in lakes	GEOLOGY												The scarcity of long-term hydrological data is a barrier to reliably determining the likelihood of floods becoming more frequent and/or intense in a warmer world. Lake sediments preserve characteristic event layers, offering the potential to develop widely distributed and unique chronologies of historical floods. Inferring flood magnitude remains a greater challenge, previously overcome in part by analyzing sharply laminated polar or alpine sequences. Here we demonstrate an approach to obtain flood frequency and magnitude data from an unexploited resource, the largely visually homogeneous, organic sediments that typify most temperate lakes. The geochemical composition and end-member modeling of sediment trap and adjacent short core particle size data for Brotherswater (northwest England) discriminates the signature of infrequent, coarse-grained flood deposits from seasonal and longer term allogenic (enhanced discharge and sediment supply during winter) and autogenic (summer productivity, thermal mixing) depositional processes. Comparing the paleoflood reconstruction to local river discharges shows that hydrological thresholds censor event signature preservation, with 4 yr recurrence intervals detectable in delta-proximal sediments declining to 9 yr in the lake center. Event threshold (discharge) and process characterization are essential precursors to discerning flood magnitude from sediment archives. Implementation of our approach in globally prevalent temperate lakes offers a vast, unique repository of long-term hydrological data for hydrologists, climate modelers, engineers, and policy makers addressing future flood risks.					; Macdonald, Neil/A-9908-2009; Schillereff, Daniel/A-4413-2015; Schillereff, Daniel/K-2489-2019; Chiverrell, Richard/A-9115-2011	Chiverrell, Richard/0000-0002-7307-2756; Macdonald, Neil/0000-0003-0350-7096; Schillereff, Daniel/0000-0002-4928-6068; 													0091-7613	1943-2682				JAN	2016	44	1					43	46		10.1130/G37261.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G37261.1													WOS:000370074800015

Impact of lake-level changes on the formation of thermogene travertine in continental rifts: Evidence from Lake Bogoria, Kenya Rift Valley	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Travertine is present at 20% of the ca 60 hot springs that discharge on Loburu delta plain on the western margin of saline, alkaline Lake Bogoria in the Kenya Rift. Much of the travertine, which forms mounds, low terraces and pool-rim dams, is sub-fossil (relict) and undergoing erosion, but calcite-encrusted artefacts show that carbonate is actively precipitating at several springs. Most of the springs discharge alkaline (pH: 8 center dot 3 to 8 center dot 9), Na-HCO3 waters containing little Ca (<2mgl1) at temperatures of 94 to 97 center dot 5 degrees C. These travertines are unusual because most probably precipitated at temperatures of >80 degrees C. The travertines are composed mainly of dendritic and platy calcite, with minor Mg-silicates, aragonite, fluorite and opaline silica. Calcite precipitation is attributed mainly to rapid CO2 degassing, which led to high-disequilibrium crystal morphologies. Stratigraphic evidence shows that the travertine formed during several stages separated by intervals of non-deposition. Radiometric ages imply that the main phase of travertine formation occurred during the late Pleistocene (ca 32 to 35ka). Periods of precipitation were influenced strongly by fluctuations in lake level, mostly under climate control, and by related changes in the depth of boiling. During relatively arid phases, meteoric recharge of ground water declines, the lake is low and becomes hypersaline, and the reduced hydrostatic pressure lowers the level of boiling in the plumbing system of the hot springs. Any carbonate precipitation then occurs below the land surface. During humid phases, the dilute meteoric recharge increases, enhancing geothermal circulation, but the rising lake waters, which become relatively dilute, flood most spring vents. Much of the aqueous Ca2+ then precipitates as lacustrine stromatolites on shallow firm substrates, including submerged older travertines. Optimal conditions for subaerial travertine precipitation at Loburu occur when the lake is at intermediate levels, and may be favoured during transitions from humid to drier conditions.

We examined effects of water temperature on the community structure of a three trophic level food chain (predatory fish, herbivorous caddisfly larvae and periphyton) in boreal streams. We used laboratory experiments to examine (i) the effects of water temperature on feeding activities of fish and caddisfly larvae and on periphyton productivity, to evaluate the thermal effects on each trophic level (species-level experiment), and (ii) the effects of water temperature on predation pressure of fish on abundance of the lower trophic levels, to evaluate how temperature affects top-down control by fish (community-level experiment). 2. In the species-level experiment, feeding activity of fish was high at 12 degrees C, which coincides with the mean summer temperature in forested streams of Hokkaido, Japan, but was depressed at 3 degrees C, which coincides with the mean winter temperature, and also above 18 degrees C, which coincides with the near maximum summer temperatures. Periphyton productivity increased over the range of water temperatures. 3. In the community-level experiments, a top-down effect of fish on the abundance of caddisfly larvae and periphyton was clear at 12 degrees C. This effect was not observed at 3 and 21 degrees C because of low predation pressure of fish at these temperatures. 4. These experiments revealed that trophic cascading effects may vary with temperature even in the presence of abundant predators. Physiological depression of predators because of thermal stress can alter top-down control and lead to changes in community structure. 5. We suggest that thermal habitat alteration can change food web structure via combinations of direct and indirect trophic interactions.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	2005	50	8					1315	1322		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01404.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01404.x													WOS:000230576500003

However, annual lake CH4 emissions calculated solely from open-water measurements that exclude the time of spring ice melt may substantially underestimate the lake CH4 source strength. We estimated potential spring CH4 emission at the time of ice melt for 19 lakes in northern Minnesota and Wisconsin. Lakes ranged in area from 2.7 to 57,300 ha and varied in littoral zone sediment type. Regression analyses indicated that lake area explained 38% of the variance in potential CH4 emission for relatively undisturbed lakes; as lake area increases potential CH4 emission per unit area decreases. Inclusion of a second term accounting for the presence or absence of soft organic-rich littoral-zone sediments explained 83% of the variance in potential spring CH4 emission. Total estimated spring CH4 emission for 1993 for all Minnesota lakes north of 45 degrees with areas greater than or equal to 4 ha was 1.5 x 10(8) mol CH, assuming a 1 : 1 ratio of soft littoral sediment to hard littoral sediment lakes. Emission estimates ranged from 5.3 x 10(7) mol assuming no lakes have soft organic-rich littoral sediments to 4.5 x 10(8) mol assuming all lakes have soft organic-rich littoral sediments. This spring CH4 pulse may make up as much as 40% of the CH4 annually emitted to the atmosphere by small lakes.																			0024-3590					JUL	1996	41	5					985	991		10.4319/lo.1996.41.5.0985	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1996.41.5.0985													WOS:A1996VN45800021

The paper considers spatial-temporary variability of the winter minimum monthly flow rates of the rivers in the basin of Lake Sevan, as well as air temperature and atmospheric precipitation of the basin. The values of hydrological and statistical characteristics of the winter minimum monthly expenditure have been calculated. Purpose of the work is: to analyze and evaluate the patterns of temporal and spatial changes in the winter minimum monthly water discharge in a number of long-term observations for rivers that flow into Lake Sevan. Methods. The study is based on observation data from 12 hydrological posts of the "Service for Hydrometeorology and Active Impact on Atmospheric Phenomena" of the Ministry of Emergencies of the Republic of Armenia. The following methods were used for this purpose: mathematical-statistical, extrapolation, interpolation, analysis, analogy, correlation. Results. Minimum runoff is one of the main characteristics to be considered when designing hydraulic structures. Duration of winter low-water period is approximately 3-4-5 months on the rivers of the studied territory. It is established from late November-December to February-March. Minimum consumption is mainly found in January-February. However, in some years it is possible in November or March. Based on physical and geographical features of the area, the monthly winter minimum flow rates of the rivers of the Lake Sevan basin are characterized by uneven spatial distribution. Winter monthly minimum consumption ranges widely from 0.015 to 1.68 m(3)/s. Close correlations between the winter minimum monthly and the average runoff of the winter period and between the winter average minimum monthly runoff and the average annual runoff were also obtained. These relations can be used to obtain the winter minimum monthly consumption of unexplored and little studied rivers of the territory under discussion for a calendar year. A close relationship between them indicates that depending on the low minimum monthly runoff, the average runoff during the winter period is just as low, and vice versa. In the study area, there is a regular increase in the minimum runoff with an increase in catchment areas, as well as with an increase in the weighted average height of the catchment. The variation coefficient of winter minimum monthly consumption is 0.15-0.60 on the territory of the Lake Sevan basin and the asymmetry coefficient is from-0.64 to 1.77. As a rule, there is a regular decrease in the minimum runoff with an increase in catchment areas. The correlation directly proportional relationship has been obtained between the coefficients values of variation and asymmetry of the winter average minimum monthly flow. There is a tendency to an increase in winter average decade decimal consumption in most rivers flowing into Lake Sevan (7 out of 12 studied posts, that is, in 58% of cases) and an increase in air temperatures and precipitation at all currently operating meteorological stations in the basin.

The relative density of all three parasite species increased with the age of the host in response to ontogenetic shifts in habitat and food of Arctic charr in the lake. Our results indicate that some recruitment of the three parasite species, particularly D. ditremum, takes place during the winter. However, winter parasite recruitment was lower than in the ice-free season. In spite of high parasite infection in some individuals, no strong indications of parasite-induced host winter mortality were found for any of the three species. Low overwintering mortality of heavily parasitized charr may be connected with a stock-reduction program in the lake that has improved the conditions of the fish, and the residual stock is probably less affected by parasites.																			0008-4301					NOV	1994	72	11					1922	1930		10.1139/z94-261	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z94-261													WOS:A1994QQ13100009

Periods of lake overturn (during fall/winter) are short and therefore difficult to capture with field campaigns but potentially one of the most important periods for methane emissions. We studied methane emissions using four different methods, including eddy covariance measurements, floating chambers, anchored funnels, and boundary model calculations. Whereas the first three methods agreed rather well, boundary model estimates were 5-30 times lower leading to a strong underestimation of methane fluxes from aquatic systems. These results show the importance of ebullition as the most important flux pathway and the need for continuous measurements with a large footprint covering also shallow parts of lakes. Although fluxes were high, on average 4 mmol m(-2) d(-1) during the overturn period, water column microbial methane oxidation removed 75% of the methane and only 25% of potential emissions were released to the atmosphere. Hence, this study illustrates second the importance of considering methane oxidation when estimating the flux of methane from lakes during overturn periods.					; Eugster, Werner/E-5116-2010; Schubert, Carsten/GQQ-1673-2022	Eugster, Werner/0000-0001-6067-0741; Schubert, Carsten J./0000-0003-1668-5967; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				APR 17	2012	46	8					4515	4522		10.1021/es203465x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es203465x								22436104					WOS:000302850300036

By documenting both the common times (hot moments) and places (hot spots) of individuals, species, and assemblages, effective conservation strategies can help to mitigate road mortality. We conducted a 1-y survey of a snake assemblage on U.S. Highway 51 along the Joyce and Manchac wildlife management areas and the Manchac Land Bridge Area between Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas, Louisiana, USA. We made 78 road-cruising surveys, which allowed us to investigate both the temporal and spatial patterns of snake road crossing activity. We found 409 snakes representing 11 species within two families, Colubridae and Viperidae. Hot moments occurred in late spring or early summer, potentially coinciding with the breeding season and mate-searching behavior in many colubrid species. Hot spots along Highway 51 were detected at the assemblage level and some species-level hot spots were also detected due to large sample sizes. Both peak times and areas of snake activity along U.S. Highway 51 may help to inform potential management efforts for reducing wildlife road mortality.																			2151-0733	1931-7603				AUG	2019	14	2					533	545																WOS:000484010900020
J	Northcote, TG; Hammar, J				Northcote, Thomas G.; Hammar, Johan			Feeding ecology of Coregonus albula and Osmerus eperlanus in the limnetic waters of Lake Malaren, Sweden	BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												A large block of unpublished information from the late 1960s on the interactive ecology of two highly zooplanktivorous fishes - vendace (Coregonus albula) and smelt (Osmerus eperlanus) - in Lambarfjarden of Lake Malaren, Sweden, was used to demonstrate quantitatively diel and seasonal changes in their limnetic feeding distribution, to compare their trophic structures, and to examine their selective use of some 20 different zooplanktonic taxa with those pelagically present by species, size, abundance and vertical distribution, Although there were significant differences in gillraker number. as well as spacing and structure between vendace and smelt, these did not seem to be strongly reflected in selection or use of major zooplanktonic prey taxa during the summer-autumn seasons. While small cladocerans dominated the prey choice of both species during June-September, large-sized calanoid copepods dominated in October. Schoener's overlap indices were high for both vertical distribution and prey taxa use by the two species, suggesting the possibility of strong competitive interaction between their planktivorous stages, though alternative explanations are explored. Their joint use of pelagic space and prey, changing seasonally, may offer a partial explanation for the marked year class fluctuations and periodic failures of vendace recruitment known to occur in Lambarfjarden, and other lakes where the two species coexist. In addition, the comparisons support the image of the environmental cul-de-sac position of vendace as an extreme zooplankton specialist. with a very narrow diet spectrum and habitat range, whereas smelt seem to express a more opportunistic ecology.																			1239-6095					JUN 30	2006	11	3					229	246																WOS:000238772500006

Wintering doves often suffer damage to their feet, and molting of immature and 2nd-year doves declines or ceases during winter. Doves are overwintering in Ontario in increasing numbers, probably as a result of increasing availability of food supplies.

The NW Himalaya receives the bulk of its rainfall from the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) with a small amount of precipitation originating from the westerlies during winter. To understand ISM variability in the last millennium, a 1 m long core was raised from Tikkar Taal Lake in the Panchkula district of Haryana, India and examined for multiple proxies (grain size, major and trace element ratios, stable isotope (delta C-13(org)) and Total Organic Carbon (TOC Wt). The statistical analyses, including End Member Modelling (EMM), correlation matrix, spectral analysis, Wavelet Transform Coherence (WTC) Analysis along with Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) analysis reveal significant changes in the Little Ice Age (LIA) and Current Warm Period (CWP). Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) C-14 dates of three bulk sediment and two gastropod samples give an age range of similar to 700 years. Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) along with El Ni & ntilde;o -Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) are the forcing factors for changes in precipitation. Two climatically significant intervals are identified, LIA (similar to 1296-1850 CE) with a moderately wet and humid phase from similar to 1296 to 1500 CE, followed by a moderately dry phase from similar to 1500 to 1850 CE overlapped by the Maunder Minimum (similar to 1645-1710 CE). The CWP is characterized by humid conditions (1850 CE onwards) coinciding with human-induced changes in the environment. The spectral analysis shows NAO and PDO like cyclicities of 15, 16, 18,19,22 and 28 yrs.					kumar, Pankaj/HPF-8395-2023; Sharma, Rajveer/KFQ-3240-2024														0031-0182	1872-616X				JUN 15	2025	668								112911	10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.112911	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.112911		MAR 2025											WOS:001456375400001

These storms are more frequent in spring and summer seasons in the Sistan region. The study aims to examine the relationship between vegetation cover and wind speed with dust storms intensity in order to understand the behavior of dust sources using satellite remote sensing data (AOD) between 2000 and 2019. Based on the time series, the study period can be divided into three parts based on the following characteristics: high dust intensity (2004), moderate relative intensity of value in all parameters studied (2005 to 2014), and dust reduction (2015-2019). Time series analysis shows a negative relationship between AOD and wind speed owing presumably to vegetative cover changes during years that wind speed has increased. Based on multiple regression analysis by monthly time scales that conforms time series result, monthly NDVI is significantly related to AOD. Analysis of the 3 hourly wind data suggests a positive relationship between wind and dust, and effective thresholds for dust erosion based on wind speeds are proposed for the Sistan region.

Of the two winters, only the second experienced significant snow cover (> 1 month). A total of six mixing classes were defined for each winter: 5 diurnal and 1 synoptic ("persistent temperature inversion", PTI); the latter being internally categorised as "strong" or "weak". Diurnal and synoptic changes in mixing state played an important role in air quality variability in both winters. Little diurnal accumulation of local pollutants (CO, NO2, PM10, and BC) was observed for wind speeds >= 1.5 m s(-1) (mixing classes #1 to #3). Under these windy conditions significant remote contributions to SO2 and O-3 concentrations in Ljubljana were observed, primarily from the Po Valley region. The most stable conditions (class #5 and PTI days), characterized by nocturnal wind speeds <= 0.5 m s(-1) or rates of 2 m air temperature change >= 1.5 degrees C h(-1), were associated with the worst air quality conditions. Only under class #5 and PTI conditions did daily-mean PM10, concentrations exceed both EU and WHO guideline values. The absence of snow cover in the first winter resulted in stronger thermodynamic stability and higher pollution concentrations. Other contributing factors included a 28% larger traffic source near the monitoring site and a 17% greater consumption of heating fuel that winter in Ljubljana.					; , Scott/AAI-6917-2020	Chambers, Scott/0000-0002-2521-959X; Kikaj, Dafina/0000-0001-7801-7396; 													0169-8095	1873-2895				JUN	2020	237								104838	10.1016/j.atmosres.2019.104838	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2019.104838													WOS:000525323100013

We aim to enhance the understanding of how lacustrine gypsum from playa-lakes can be used for paleoclimate reconstruction. Gypsum samples were collected at 30-meter intervals along a transect from the shore to the depocenter of the lake. Comparison of delta O-18 and delta H-2 values of gypsum hydration water with the modern seasonal isotope variability of lake water points to gypsum formation in spring and early summer, before complete desiccation of the lake. An increasing trend in the delta O-18 and delta H-2 values of gypsum hydration water, by similar to 1,5 and similar to 15 parts per thousand, respectively, is observed from the shore to the depocenter. This indicates that coeval gypsum formed in different parts of the lakebed record slightly different isotopic values of the lake water during precipitation. This spatial variability should be considered when interpreting stable isotope series of gypsum hydration water from ephemeral lake sediments.

Studying the biology and ecology of endemic species may substantially help to assess risk of extinction and define proxies for their conservation. Laurogammarus scutarensis is a Balkan endemic and the only species within the genus Laurogammarus G. Karaman 1984. Its distribution is restricted to temperature-stable, cool waters of the springs, streams and lower sections of a few rivers emptying to the north-western part of the Skadar Lake in Montenegro an area under heavy anthropogenic pressure in recent years. We examined life history of the species in a limnocrene spring with year-round stable temperature (10 degrees C +/- 0.5) by estimating its population structure over a year, fecundity, reproductive period and relationship between photoperiod and reproduction. These parameters were compared to those of other gammarids, including invasive species, in order to estimate the role of photoperiod in shaping life history of L. scutarensis, and to give insight into the possible conservation needs for that species. Our results show that the species is univoltine and its reproduction continues round the year. However, its intensity is synchronised with seasonal day length changes with the highest share of females breeding in spring and early summer. The population sex structure is strongly female biased in most of the year. Number of eggs laid depends positively on the female body length; however the mean brood size (15.53 eggs) of L. scutarensis is rather low when compared to other species. Also partial fecundity and mean body length at which individuals start to reproduce indicate that its reproductive potential is much lower than that of many other gammarid species, including those colonising many European water bodies in recent years. Concluding, the studied life history traits of L. scutarensis combined with its very narrow distribution range and peculiar thermal requirements reported in the literature provide as with the hint to define the species as vulnerable to threats posed by the habitat degradation and competition with other species. Taking into account the risk of invasion by alien species and progressive habitat loss, we are of the opinion that L. scutarensis should be recognised as an endangered species and that a conservation plan should be implemented to prevent its possible extinction.

SETTLEMENT, SEASONAL SIZE DISTRIBUTION, AND GROWTH OF THE INVASIVE BIVALVE MYTILOPSIS LEUCOPHAEATA (CONRAD, 1831) (DREISSENIDAE) IN RELATION TO ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS	JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH												Conrad's false mussel (Mytilopsis leucophaeata) is an invasive alien bivalve species causing severe biofouling problems in cooling water systems of power and industrial plants. Settlement, seasonal shell size distribution, and growth of this bivalve species were analyzed in relation to relevant environmental factors, using monitoring data from a brackish canal over a period of 4 y. Salinity at the sampling site ranged from 3.2 to 9.2, water temperature from 4.5 degrees C to 23.9 degrees C, and chlorophyll a content from 2 to 56 mu gl(-1). Once a month one short-term exposed panel (1mo exposed) and one long-term exposed panel (exposed from February 1989 to the month of sampling) were collected. Settled spat and attached mussels were collected monthly from these polyvinylchloride panels and from stones in the littoral zone. The short-term exposed panels were used to determine the period of spat fall. The long-term panels were used to study growth, shell length-frequency distribution, and densities of the mussel population after settlement. To study 3maximum age, M. leucophaeata were kept in cages in the canal. The highest recorded settlement was 204,000 individuals/m(2). The largest mussel had a shell length of 24.0 mm. Three cohorts of shell length (1-5 mm, 5-15 mm and 15-24 mm) could be distinguished. Data on survival of individual mussel size groups in cages indicated a maximum age of 4.5 y. Shell growth was very low in winter time (average growth less than 1 mu m/day in the period of November to April). The average growth rate on the stones during the summer periods (3-4 mo) was 89 mu m/day. On the panels, a rapid shell growth to an average shell length of 4mm was recorded in the period of July until November in their first year, followed by a period of hardly any shell growth from December until May, and a subsequently rapid shell growth to an average shell length of 13 mm during the period of May until August in the second year. Individual mussels grew up to 20.9 mm during a 13-mo period. Growth of shells was significantly correlated with water temperature. The minimum threshold temperature for shell growth stops was 9.1 degrees C (9.1 degrees C-10.1 degrees C) based on monthly measurements. Growth started at a minimum temperature of 9.1 degrees C (9.1 degrees C-14.2 degrees C).

J	Stevens, CL; Lawrence, GA				Stevens, CL; Lawrence, GA			Stability and meromixis in a water-filled mine pit	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A field experiment examined stability and stratification in a disused mine pit filled with 1.75 x 10(7) m(3) of water. Vertical profiles of conductivity and temperature indicated that, due to substantial chemical stratification, spring and autumn overturn did not penetrate to the base of the pit. Although parameterization indicated that double diffusion should be expected, we found only circumstantial evidence of associated step structure. The available data suggest that groundwater inflow created a warm salty pool of water at the base of the water column, giving the appearance of a meromictic structure with a monimolimnion. However, this pool was not a consistent feature, suggesting both a variable inflow and significant diffusion rates. From the temperature data, estimates indicated that hypolimnetic vertical eddy diffusivity varied between 1 x 10(-7) and 5 x 10(-5) m(2) s(-1). The observations identify short-term relatively energetic internal wave events that may have a significant impact on this value. The present study is useful in two ways: first, it shows how pit-lakes form a natural laboratory for a range of processes, and second, it illustrates how these processes relate to diffusion parameterization. It is clear that reliable parameterization is vital for long-term modeling required for prediction of water quality over decadal timescales.

JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												In some lakes, large amounts of the potentially toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis overwinter in the sediment. This overwintering population might inoculate the water column in spring and promote the development of dense surface blooms of Microcystis during summer. In the Dutch Lake Volkerak, we found photochemically active Microcystis colonies in the sediment throughout the year. The most vital colonies originated from shallow sediments within the euphotic zone. We investigated whether recruitment of Microcystis colonies from the sediment to the water column was an active process, through production of gas vesicles or respiration of carbohydrate ballast. We calculated net buoyancy, as an indication of relative density, using the amounts and densities of the major cell constituents (carbohydrates, proteins, and gas vesicles). Carbohydrate content of benthic Microcystis cells was very low throughout the year. Buoyancy changes of benthic Microcystis were mostly a result of changes in gas vesicle volume. Before the summer bloom, net buoyancy and the amount of buoyant colonies in the sediment did not change. Therefore, recruitment of Microcystis from the sediment does not seem to be an active process regulated by internal buoyancy changes. Instead, our observations indicate that attachment of sediment particles to colonies plays an important part in the buoyancy state of benthic colonies. Therefore, we suggest that recruitment of Microcystis is more likely a passive process resulting from resuspension by wind-induced mixing or bioturbation. Consequently, shallow areas of the lake probably play a more important role in recruitment of benthic Microcystis than deep areas.					; Ibelings, Bas/B-4237-2011; Visser, Petra/NJT-4667-2025; Huisman, Jef/A-1089-2013	Verspagen, Jolanda/0000-0001-9295-4183; Visser, Petra/0000-0003-3294-1908; Huisman, Jef/0000-0001-9598-3211														1529-8817				APR	2004	40	2					260	270		10.1111/j.1529-8817.2004.03174.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2004.03174.x													WOS:000220354400004

Ice cover and thaw events influence nitrogen partitioning and concentration in two shallow eutrophic lakes	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												The frequency and duration of lake ice cover is rapidly declining in the Northern Hemisphere. Limited research in oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes suggests that extended periods of ice cover influence nitrogen (N) cycling by promoting nitrate (NO3-) accumulation. However, ice cover impacts on N cycling in shallow, high-nutrient, eutrophic lakes remains poorly understood. To understand drivers of under-ice water column N concentrations, we examined concurrent under-ice N concentration, hydro-meterological, and physicochemical time series from two shallow eutrophic systems during sustained cold and thaw periods. We compared data from both lakes during a historically cold winter to assess how different lake-watershed physical configurations and algal biomass affected under-ice N cycling. We also used time series data from consecutive winters to assess the influence of a mild versus a historically cold winter on under-ice N cycling in one of the lakes. We found that ice cover promoted NO3- depletion when sustained cold disconnected lakes from watershed loading, but the amount of depletion varied between lakes and was enhanced during the colder winter. Thaw events increased NO3- concentrations compared to late winter and altered the concentration and distribution of N species in the water column, but the degree and nature of increased NO3- varied with thaw severity, the source of meltwater, timing, and lake-watershed morphometry. Our results suggest that winters with shorter ice duration and more thaw events may result in less NO3- depletion and higher peak NO3- concentrations in shallow eutrophic lakes, with potential implications for N cycling and phytoplankton ecology.					; Stockwell, Jason/HSC-4786-2023; Kincaid, Dustin/AFQ-5401-2022	Schroth, Andrew/0000-0001-5553-3208; Adair, E.

Response of the Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica, to ocean gravity-wave forcing	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY												Comparison of the Ross Ice Shelf (RIS, Antarctica) response at near-front seismic station RIS2 with seismometer data collected on tabular iceberg B15A and with land-based seismic stations at Scott Base on Ross Island (SBA) and near Lake Vanda in the Dry Valleys (VNDA) allows identification Of RIS-specific signals resulting from gravity-wave forcing that includes meteorologically driven wind waves and swell, infragravity (IG) waves and tsunami waves. The vibration response of the RIS varies with season and with the frequency and amplitude of the gravity-wave forcing. The response of the RIS to IG wave and swell impacts is much greater than that observed at SBA and VNDA. A spectral peak at near-ice-front seismic station RIS2 centered near 0.5 Hz, which persists during April when swell is damped by sea ice, may be a dominant resonance or eigenfrequency of the RIS. High-amplitude swell events excite relatively broadband signals that are likely fracture events (icequakes). Changes in coherence between the vertical and horizontal sensors in the 8-12 Hz band from February to April, combined with the appearance of a spectral peak near 10 Hz in April when sea ice damps swell, suggest that lower (higher) temperatures during austral winter (summer) months affect signal propagation characteristics and hence mechanical properties of the RIS.

Ebinur Lake, the largest saline lake in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, is vital for regional biodiversity and environmental stability but has been facing the predicament of gradual shrinkage in recent decades. In this study, we proposed a new dual-index method for Landsat (-5, -7, -8, and -9) data to extract water with the combinations of the normalized difference water index (NDWI) and the modified NDWI for turbid waters (NDWIturbid). The dual-index method showed a high overall accuracy of 96.36% for Ebinur Lake. Landsat series images from 1992 to 2023 were employed to acquire the water areas of Ebinur Lake. The results showed that, over the past three decades, the area of Ebinur Lake exhibited a fluctuating decreasing trend, with an average lake area of 568.74 +/- 152.43 km(2). The northwest intermittent water areas showed significant changes, and there was a close connection between the northwest and core water areas. Seasonally, the lake area decreased from spring to autumn. River inflow, driven by rainfall and human activities, was the primary factor affecting the inter/inner annual changes in Ebinur Lake. Furthermore, due to the valley effects, wind was found to be a critical factor in the diurnal changes in the water areas. This study should deepen the understanding of the variations of Ebinur Lake and benefit local water resource management.

Here, a resampling method was used to reproduce the suspended particulate matter (SPM) dataset in 43 large lakes (>50 km(2)) on the eastern China plain during 2003-2017 at different temporal resolutions using MODIS Aqua (MODISA) based on Google Earth Engine platform, then to address the impact of temporal resolution on the long-term SPM dataset. Differences between the MODISA-derived and reproduced SPM dataset at longer temporal resolution were higher in the areas with large water dynamics. The spatial and temporal distributions of the differences were driven by unfavorable observation environments during satellite overpasses such as high cloud cover, and rapid changes in water quality, such as water inundation, algae blooms, and macrophytes. Furthermore, the annual mean difference in SPM ranged from 5-10% when the temporal difference was less than 10 d, and the differences in summer and autumn were higher than that of other seasons and surpassed 20% when the temporal resolution was more than 16 d. To assure that difference were less than 10% for long-term satellite-derived SPM datasets, the minimal requirement of temporal resolution should be within 5 d for most of the inland lakes and 3 d for lakes with large changes in water quality. This research can be used to not only evaluate the reliability of historically remote sensing products but also provide a reference for planning field campaigns and applying of high spatial resolution satellite missions to monitor aquatic systems in the future.

J	Ahmed, S; Troy, CD; Hawley, N				Ahmed, Sultan; Troy, Cary D.; Hawley, Nathan			Spatial structure of internal Poincare waves in Lake Michigan	ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS												In this paper we examine the characteristics of near-inertial internal Poincare waves in Lake Michigan (USA) as discerned from field experiments and hydrodynamic simulations. The focus is on the determination of the lateral and vertical structure of the waves. Observations of near-inertial internal wave properties are presented from two field experiments in southern Lake Michigan conducted during the years 2009 and 2010 at Michigan City (IN, USA) and Muskegon (MI, USA), respectively. Spectra of thermocline displacements and baroclinic velocities show that kinetic and potential baroclinic energy is dominated by near-inertial internal Poincare waves. Vertical structure discerned from empirical orthogonal function analysis shows that this energy is predominantly vertical mode 1. Idealized hydrodynamic simulations using stratifications from early summer (June), mid-summer (July) and fall (September) identify the basin-scale internal Poincare wave structure as a combination of single-and two-basin cells, similar to those identified in Lake Erie by Schwab, with near-surface velocities largest in the center of the northern and southern basins. Near-inertial bottom kinetic energy is seen to have roughly constant magnitude over large swathes across the basin, with higher magnitude in the shallower areas like the Mid-lake Plateau, as compared with the deep northern and southern basins. The near-bottom near-inertial kinetic energy when mapped appears similar to the bottom topography map. The wave-induced vertical shear across thermocline is concentrated along the longitudinal axis of the lake basin, and both near-bottom velocities and thermocline shear are reasonably explained by a simple conceptual model of the expected transverse variability.

Deep photoautotrophic prokaryotes contribute substantially to carbon dynamics in oxygen-deficient waters in a permanently redox-stratified freshwater lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												In lakes, seasonal phytoplankton blooms and allochthonous plant debris intensify particulate organic carbon fluxes to the lakebed. Microbes associated with these particles likely vary with organic substrate lability and redox conditions. To explore microbial compositional responses to these variables, we analyzed particle-associated and free-living assemblages in the permanently redox-stratified Fayetteville Green Lake using 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing during the peak and end of cyanobacterial and photoautotrophic sulfur bacterial blooms. Assemblage compositions were strongly influenced by redox conditions and particle association. Assemblage compositions varied seasonally above the lower oxycline boundary (summer-generalist heterotrophs; autumn-iron reducers and specialist heterotrophs), but not in the anoxic region below. Particle-associated assemblages were less diverse than free-living assemblages and were dominated by heterotrophs that putatively metabolize complex organic substrates, purple sulfur bacteria, sulfur-cycling Desulfocapsa, and eukaryotic algae. The least diverse particle-associated assemblages occurred near the lower oxycline boundary, where microbial activities and abundances were highest, and anoxygenic photoautotrophs were enriched. The low-diversity particle-associated heterotrophs likely remineralize complex organic substrates, releasing simpler organic substrates to free-living assemblages during transit, thereby influencing surrounding microbial diversity and function. Our results challenge the paradigm that phytoplankton from the shallow photic zone are the primary contributor to the vertical flux. We suggest that photoautotrophic prokaryotes from the deep photic zone contribute significantly to deep-water carbon in this environment, and possibly in other oxygen-deficient waters with sulfidic photic zones. Furthermore, results suggest that seasonally variable terrestrial carbon and metal inputs also influence microbial diversity and function in similar systems.

J	Rull, V; Vegas-Vilarrúbia, T				Rull, Valenti; Vegas-Vilarrubia, Teresa			Climatic and Anthropogenic Drivers of Forest Succession in the Iberian Pyrenees during the Last 500 Years: A Statistical Approach	FORESTS												Anticipating future successional forest trends in the face of ongoing global change is an essential conservation target. Mountain forests are especially sensitive to environmental shifts, and their past responses to climatic and anthropogenic (external) drivers may provide a basis for improving predictions of future developments. This paper uses independent high-resolution palynological and paleoclimatic reconstructions to statistically analyze the long-term effects of external drivers on regional forest succession in the central Iberian Pyrenees during the last 500 years. The statistical methods used are Gaussian response analysis, cluster analysis, rate-of-change analysis, principal component analysis, and redundancy analysis. The dominant taxa of these forests (Quercus, Betula, Pinus) showed significant relationships with summer temperature, summer drought, and autumn precipitation. Immediate and delayed (by two or more decades) responses of these trees to climatic drivers were identified. Regional succession showed a closed path, starting at the end points around the attraction domain of pine-dominated forests. This trajectory was determined by a trend toward anthropogenic forest clearing (16th to 18th centuries) and a reverse trend of natural forest recovery (18th to 20th centuries). Forest clearing was due to burning, facilitated by drought, and was followed by the expansion of cropping and grazing lands. Forest recovery was fostered by reduced human pressure and rising temperatures. The statistical approach used in this work has unraveled ecological relationships that remained unnoticed in previous works and would be important for predicting future successional trends under changing climates. The reported response lags of individual taxa to climatic drivers may complicate the establishment of reliable ecological relationships and should be addressed in future studies.

Significant (p < 0.01) differences between Kunimasu and Himemasu from Lake Saiko occurred in counts of anal-fin rays, pectoral-fin rays, gill rakers (no overlap found) and pyloric caeca. Secondary sexual characters related to maturity level were also found in Kunimasu, the body being more compressed in pre-spawning and spawning males and females than in immature and maturing individuals. Furthermore, maturing male Kunimasu and Himemasu also differed in body shape. Body coloration of Kunimasu also differed according to level of maturity, the nuptial coloration in both sexes being olive-green when alive and black when fresh. Dark dots, found in ca. 40 % of Kunimasu individuals examined, were less distinct than in Himemasu. The spawning season of Kunimasu extended through winter and early spring in Lake Saiko, with spawning males and females remaining near the bottom, compared with non-spawning individuals which occupied the upper and middle profundal zones in the daytime.

J	Li, J; Wang, B; Yang, YM				Li, Juan; Wang, Bin; Yang, Young-Min			Retrospective seasonal prediction of summer monsoon rainfall over West Central and Peninsular India in the past 142 years	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Prediction of Indian summer (June-September) rainfall on regional scales remains an open issue. The operational predictions of West Central Indian summer rainfall (WCI-R) and Peninsular Indian summer rainfall (PI-R) made by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) had no skills during 2004-2012. This motivates the present study aiming at better understanding the predictability sources and physical processes governing summer rainfall variability over these two regions. Analysis of 133 year data reveal that although the lower boundary forcing that associated with enhanced WCI-R and PI-R featured a similar developing La-Nina and "east high west low" sea-level pressure (SLP) dipole pattern across the Indo-Pacific, the anomalous high sea surface temperature (SST) over the northern Indian Ocean and weak low pressure over northern Asia tended to enhance PI-R but reduce WCI-R. Based on our understanding of physical linkages with the predictands, we selected four and two causative predictors for predictions of the WCI-R and PI-R, respectively. The intensified summer WCI-R is preceded by (a) Indian Ocean zonal dipole-like SST tendency (west-warming and east-cooling), (b) tropical Pacific zonal dipole SST tendency (west-warming and east-cooling), (c) central Pacific meridional dipole SST tendency (north-cooling and south-warming), and (d) decreasing SLP tendency over northern Asia in the previous season. The enhanced PI-R was lead by the central-eastern Pacific cooling and 2-m temperature cooling tendency east of Lake Balkhash in the previous seasons. These causative processes linking the predictors and WCI-R and PI-R are supported by ensemble numerical experiments using a coupled climate model. For the period of 1871-2012, the physics-based empirical (P-E) prediction models built on these predictors result in cross-validated forecast temporal correlation coefficient skills of 0.55 and 0.47 for WCI-R and PI-R, respectively. The independent forecast skill is significantly higher than the skill of operational seasonal forecast made by the IMD for the period of 2004-2012. These prediction models offer a tool for seasonal prediction and their retrospective forecast skills provide an estimation of the lower bound of the predictability for WCI-R and PI-R.

J	NALEPA, TF				NALEPA, TF			OCCURRENCE OF A RESTING STAGE IN CYCLOPOID AND HARPACTICOID COPEPODS IN NEARSHORE LAKE-MICHIGAN	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Temporal and spatial differences in the abundance of dormant harpacticoid and cyclopoid copepods in a nearshore area of southeastern Lake Michigan are described. Core samples were taken at 3 depths (11, 17 and 23 m) at monthly intervals from May to Nov. 1976-1979. All dormant harpacticoids were Canthocamptus robertcokeri or C. staphylinoides, and all dormant cyclopoids were stage IV copepodids, likely Diacyclops thomasi. The percentage of Canthocamptus and copepodids IV found in the resting state declined dramatically with increased sampling depth. Dormant Canthocamptus were most abundant in late summer/fall in each of the 4 sampling years. During this period, usually over 50% of all Canthocamptus were found in the dormant condition. Dormant cyclopoids were most abundant between June and Sept., but exact seasonal patterns varied from year to year. Factors initiating the dormant condition are not clear, but water temperatures and day length may be important environmental cues. Some of the spatial and year-to-year differences in the proportion of dormant individuals appeared related to variations in the amount of surface detritus. This is the 1st report of a resting stage in the life cycle of cyclopoids in the Great Lakes.																			0380-1330						1985	11	1					59	66		10.1016/S0380-1330(85)71744-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(85)71744-3													WOS:A1985AES0100008

We assessed above ground biomass and temporal pattern of productivity and viability of seeds by sampling eight plots and 20 collection boxes, respectively. In addition, we recorded the different phenological stages of the species during this event. The study area was in the sector of Antillanca, dominated by a mixed evergreen-deciduous Nothofagus forest. Biomass values were 33.50 Mg ha(-1) fresh weight and 17.66 Mg ha(-1) dry weight. The peak values of seed production and viability were 146.86 x 10(6) +/- 130.54 x 10(6) seeds ha(-1) and 87.5 %, respectively. The phenological features observed were similar to those observed for Chusquea quila; nevertheless, mountain climate, where Chusquea montana occurs, was reflected by some differences in maturation and seeding times.						de la Fuente, Alejandro/0000-0001-9686-3844													0717-9200						2017	38	3					599	604		10.4067/S0717-92002017000300018	http://dx.doi.org/10.4067/S0717-92002017000300018													WOS:000417488400018

The aim of the paper is to identify the perceptions and adaptation strategies of Finnish nature-based tourism entrepreneurs on climate change. The case study was conducted by interviewing nature-based tourism entrepreneurs in northern Finland and the Finnish Lake District, south east Finland. In general, the entrepreneurs were aware of the issue of global climate change. However, half of the interviewees did not believe that the phenomenon actually exists and will influence the region's tourism industry in the future. The scepticism towards the climate change may explain the fact that there were almost no adaptation strategies. However, other adaptation mechanisms were used to cope with the 'normal' weather variation and market changes.					; Tervo-Kankare, Kaarina/D-8516-2018; Saarinen, Jarkko/AAD-3227-2019	Tervo-Kankare, Kaarina/0000-0003-1518-794X; Saarinen, Jarkko/0000-0002-9327-6932; 													1740-8822	1740-8830					2006	1	3			SI		214	228		10.1504/IJISD.2006.012423	http://dx.doi.org/10.1504/IJISD.2006.012423													WOS:000437533500004

A strong linear relationship was obtained between the two parameters (F = 262, n = 131) which explained 66% of the variation. There was a distinct seasonal trend, however, in the amount of chlorophyll a measured per unit algal cell volume (Chla/CV). Values of Chla/CV ranged between 1.9-12.4 .mu.g .cntdot. mm-3, and were generally high during the winter (interquartile range 6.6-10.5, n = 33) and low during the summer (interquartile range 2.8-3.9, n = 47). When this effect was taken into account, the explanatory power of the Chla-CV relationship increased to 78%. This relationship was not significantly affected by changes in phytoplankton taxonomic composition (i.e., Bacillariophyceae Chlorophyceae, Dinophyceae), and reliably predicts either Chla or CV in other North Island lakes. Application of the predictive relation is discussed and further corroboration of the relation is encouraged.																			0028-825X	1175-8643					1984	22	2					295	301		10.1080/0028825X.1984.10425257	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0028825X.1984.10425257													WOS:A1984TD04200010

Large smallmouth bass (>406 mm) used deep water (>8 m) more often than did small (248-279 mm) or medium-sized (305-356 mm) smallmouth bass during the late summer (15 July-1 September). Large smallmouth bass also were found at middepths (4-8 m) significantly more often than were small individuals during late summer. Small fish used cover more frequently than large ones during early summer (10 June-13 July). Both small and medium-sized individuals were associated with cover more frequently than large smallmouth bass were during the late summer. Small smallmouth bass exhibited significantly smaller summer total ranges than did large individuals, and mean active displacement differed among all three size-classes.																			0002-8487					SEP	1997	126	5					815	821		10.1577/1548-8659(1997)126<0815:ROASTM>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1997)126<0815:ROASTM>2.3.CO;2													WOS:000071083800009

Climate-driven mid- to late Holocene hydrologic evolution of arid wetlands documented by strontium, uranium, and oxygen isotopes from Lower Pahranagat Lake, southern Nevada, USA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Lacustrine carbonates in a 12.4-m-long core from Lower Pahranagat Lake (LPAH), southern Nevada, indicate that radiogenic isotopes of Sr and U (Sr-87/Sr-86 and U-234/U-238) preserve evidence of past variations in water sources and evolving hydrologic conditions. Sr and U isotope compositions in LPAH carbonates fall within the range defined by the three primary groundwater sources in Pahranagat Valley and reflect variable mixtures of those sources since the mid-Holocene. Compositions in the oldest sample (5.78 ka) closely match modern compositions of modern discharge from nearby springs, indicating that LPAH water was derived almost exclusively from the local volcanic aquifer. By ca. 5.3-5.2 ka, LPAH water compositions shifted sharply towards isotopic compositions observed in groundwater from the regional carbonate aquifer, indicating a marked increase in surface flow from high-volume springs discharging from the carbonate aquifer to the north. Sediments deposited between 3.08-1.06 ka indicate reduced contributions from the regional aquifer. A comparison of uranium- and oxygen-isotope values in LPAH carbonates suggests that wetter climate conditions favor increased supply from deeper, regional carbonate aquifers compared to drier conditions when contributions from shallower, local volcanic aquifers were more important.

These morphs, dwarf and normal charr, differed in body size and morphology, age at maturity, and habitat use during feeding and spawning. The segregation during spawning appeared to be almost complete, corroborating the results of a preview enzyme electrophoretic study (Hindar et al., 1986 Biol. J. Linn. Soc., 27, 269-85) which suggested that the two chan morphs represent sympatric populations with a restricted amount of gene flow between them. Both morphs showed a positive correlation between year-class strength and minimum pH in spring/summer of that year, hence both morphs appeared to be affected by acidification. If is suggested that addition of limestone to the spawning substrate used by charr may be one way to protect the unique genetic and ecological variability of Arctic charr in this lake.

Has the Three-Gorges Dam made the Poyang Lake wetlands wetter and drier?	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The Three-Georges Dam holds many records in the history of engineering. While the dam has produced benefits in terms of flood control, hydropower generation and increased navigation capacity of the Yangtze River, serious questions have been raised concerning its impact on both upstream and downstream ecosystems. It has been suggested that the dam operation intensifies the extremes of wet and dry conditions in the downstream Poyang Lake, and affects adversely important local wetlands. A floodgate has been proposed to maintain the lake water level by controlling the flow between the Poyang Lake and Yangtze River. Using extensive hydrological data and generalized linear statistical models, we demonstrated that the dam operation induces major changes in the downstream river discharge near the dam, including an average "water loss". The analysis also revealed considerable effects on the Poyang Lake water level, particularly a reduced level over the dry period from late summer to autumn. However, the dam impact needs to be further assessed based on long-term monitoring of the lake ecosystem, covering a wide range of parameters related to hydrological and hydraulic characteristics of the lake, water quality, geomorphological characteristics, aquatic biota and their habitat, wetland vegetation and associated fauna.

Feeding ecology of lake whitefish in Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We determined diet composition, feeding strategy, prey size, and effects of prey type on food weight and energy in stomachs for lake whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis in Lake Huron during 2002-04. Age-0 lake whitefish (73-149 mm TL) ate mainly large-bodied cladoceran zooplankton in the summer (July-mid September). Medium lake whitefish (<= 350 mm TL excluding age-0) generally ate soft-bodied macroinvertebrates, especially Chironomidae larvae and pupae, in the spring (mid May-June). Zooplankton, if eaten, were generally most important in the summer. Molluscs were generally a minor part of medium lake whitefish diets. Large lake whitefish (> 350 mm) mainly ate molluscs, particularly quagga mussels (Dreissena bugensis), despite geographic differences in mussel abundance. Large-bodied crustaceans (Diporeia spp., Mysis relicta, Isopoda) were a minor part of large lake whitefish diets. Lake whitefish demonstrated a flexible feeding strategy, with individual specialization on some prey and generalized feeding on others. The size of benthic prey (Diporeia spp., Chironomidae, and Dreissena spp.) eaten increased with fish size and influenced the energetic value of prey for medium and large lake whitefish. The type of prey eaten affected the food and energy intake differently for each size class of lake whitefish. Age-0 lake whitefish that ate mainly zooplankton had more food and energy in stomachs than fish eating shelled prey or other macroinvertebrates. On the other hand, food weight in stomachs did not differ across prey groups for medium fish, but energy in stomachs was lowest for fish that ate shelled prey. For large lake whitefish, there was no difference in food weight or energy in stomachs for different prey groups.

J	GLASER, PH; JANSSENS, JA; SIEGEL, DI				GLASER, PH; JANSSENS, JA; SIEGEL, DI			THE RESPONSE OF VEGETATION TO CHEMICAL AND HYDROLOGICAL GRADIENTS IN THE LOST RIVER PEATLAND, NORTHERN MINNESOTA	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												(1) Two peat mounds have developed in the Lost River peatland of northern Minnesota. One has the chemical and physical properties of an extremely rich fen and the other has the properties of a raised bog. The two mounds are separated by a water track with poor-fen vegetation and chemistry. (2) The vegetation at Lost River can be divided into five noda that correspond to landform units: spring-fen channel, spring-fen forest, marginal swamp forest, water track, and raised bog. These vegetation types have well-defined ranges for pH and calcium concentration. (3) Ordinations of the vascular plant and bryophyte data indicate a close relationship between the vegetation and both moisture and chemical gradients. The link between vegetation and chemistry is also supported by plots of species richness vs. pH and calcium concentration in which the peak in species numbers occurs within the rich-fen range. (4) The chemistry of the surface waters at Lost River is largely determined by the mixing of alkaline groundwater with precipitation, because the entire peatland is located at least seasonally within a discharge zone for groundwater. Mixing models indicate that the amount of groundwater within the surface waters ranges from 50% in the spring-fen channels to 1% on the raised bog. (5) The development of the two peat mounds was reconstructed from peat cores collected near the crests of the spring-fen mound and raised bog. The raised bog developed over a depression, which was first filled in with fen peat before minerotrophic sphagna invaded the site around 2625 B.P. By 2200 B.P. all fen indicator species had disappeared and the site was dominated by assemblages similar to those in the present raised bog. (6) The spring-fen mound, however, developed over a rise in the mineral substrate, which was not covered by peat until 3000 B.P. The mound was quickly colonized by Sphagnum and no fen indicators appeared until 1160 B.P. At this time the bog vegetation was replaced by a sedge fen containing assemblages similar to the present spring-fen channel. (7) This sharp reversal from bog to fen under the spring-fen mound can best be explained by the discharge of alkaline groundwater at the peat surface in sufficient quantities to convert the bog vegetation to a spring-fen channel.																			0022-0477	1365-2745				DEC	1990	78	4					1021	1048		10.2307/2260950	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2260950													WOS:A1990FD41600011

We studied the seasonal succession of phyto- and zooplankton and the potential impact of predation by salmonids on zooplankton population dynamics in a high-mountain Swiss lake. 2. A comparison of patterns in the abundance, body length, fecundity and age structure in the Daphnia galeata population strongly suggests that trout predation had little impact on the population and was not the cause for a decline in summer. 3. The dominance in the lake of adult trout that feed mainly on benthic prey may buffer the effect of predation on the larger zooplankton. Further, the relatively high amount of phytoplankton after spring thaw could be important for sustaining the Daphnia population under moderate fish predation. 4. Partial correlation analyses proved circumstantial evidence for both exploitative and interference competition between some zooplankton taxa. D. galeata depressed performance of other plankton species through exploitative competition. 5. Our study shows that the impact of fish on zooplankton in high-mountain lakes depends strongly on food web structure and trophic state of the lake. Where fish predation is weak, invertebrate predation combined with competition for food may be responsible for the dominance of large-bodied zooplankton species.

Many chrysophytes are known to have limited tolerance to changes in pH, temperature, salinity, conductivity, trophic status, heavy metals and organic pollutants, and therefore represent a potentially valuable group of organisms for reconstruction of e. e. cold season climate or anthropogenic nutrient inputs. Aiming to disentangle the relative influence of climate changes versus anthropogenic nutrient inputs on cysts, we related changes in the cyst assemblages from annually-laminated sediments of Lake Silvaplana (south-eastern Swiss Alps, 1792 m a.s.l.), which covered the time period AD 1940-2004, to measured meteorological variables and biogenic silica flux, which is known to represent anthropogenic nutrient inputs. Multivariate statistical analyses suggest that major changes in cyst assemblages were primarily influenced by climatic factors, in particular mean October to March air temperatures. Anthropogenic nutrient inputs seemed to have a secondary, yet significant impact on cyst assemblages. This impact does not appear to be correlated to climatic factors.																			0029-5035	2363-7188					2010				136			103	115		10.1127/1438-9134/2010/0136-0103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1438-9134/2010/0136-0103													WOS:000279419900009

These catchments are located near Poznan in the southern part of the Greater Poland Lake District, in Poland. The water quality of investigated rivers in 1998 and 1999 was evaluated as good, The water of the Potaszka river was in the first class of cleanness (Polish standards) (excluding nitrite nitrogen). Whereas in the water of the Hutka river during summer and autumn months, very low concentration of dissolved oxygen and high concentration of phosphates were noted. The phosphates from soluble compounds of phosphorus were produced in anaerobic conditions. High to medium concentration of nutrients (N, P, K) was a main pollution in the groundwater of both investigated catchments. The water quality of the groundwater in forested the Hutka catchment was better than in the agriculturally used the Potaszka catchment, No significant differences of groundwater quality in differentiated forest habitats were noted.

Assessment of a Microphysical Ensemble Used to Investigate the OWLeS IOP4 Lake-Effect Storm	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												Microphysical processes within mixed-phase convective clouds can have cascading impacts on cloud properties and resultant precipitation. This paper investigates the role of microphysics in the lake-effect storm (LES) observed during intensive observing period 4 of the Ontario Winter Lake-effect Systems field campaign. A microphysical ensemble is composed of 24 simulations that differ in the microphysics scheme used (e.g., Weather Research and Forecasting Model microphysics options or a choice of two bulk adaptive habit models) along with changes in the representation of aerosol and potential ice nuclei concentrations, ice nucleation parameterizations, rain and ice fall speeds, spectral indices, ice habit assumptions, and the number of moments used for modeling ice-phase hydrometeors in each adaptive habit model. Each of these changes to microphysics resulted in varied precipitation types at the surface; 15 members forecast a mixture of snow, ice, and graupel, 7 members forecast only snow and ice, and the remaining 2 members forecast a combination of snow, ice, graupel, and rain. Observations from an optical disdrometer positioned to the south of the LES core indicate that 92% of the observed particles were snow and ice, 5% were graupel, and 3% were rain and drizzle. Analysis of observations spanning more than a point location, such as polarimetric radar observations and aircraft measurements of liquid water content, provides insight into cloud composition and processes leading to the differences at the surface. Ensemble spread is controlled by hydrometeor type differences spurred by processes or parameters (e.g., ice fall speed) that affect graupel mass.					; Tsai, Tzu-Chin/ABD-9703-2021; Chen, Jen-Ping/F-1823-2017; Chen, Jen-Ping/F-2947-2010; Gaudet, Lauriana/AAA-8528-2019	Gaudet, Lauriana/0000-0003-4679-4507; Chen, Jen-Ping/0000-0003-4188-6189; Tsai, Tzu-Chin/0000-0001-7527-4362													0022-4928	1520-0469				MAY	2021	78	5					1607	1628		10.1175/JAS-D-20-0045.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAS-D-20-0045.1													WOS:000731771500012

Only four of the 8718 identified stomach feathers originated from a species other than Great Crested Grebes. In all, 68% were breast belly feathers and 19% were flank feathers. Flank feathers were positively selected from those becoming available during moult, and also occurred more in the ejected pellets than expected from the intake. This suggests that flank feathers, which are long and curved and have a black tip, may be especially suited for the formation of pellets. Feather ingestion was more than balanced by feather production. Feathers were most abundant in stomachs in autumn and were least numerous in winter. Most of this variation can be explained by seasonal differences in the intensity of body moult. In addition, the type of prey was related to the number of ingested feathers. When the diet consisted of smelt, which leave little indigestible matter, more feathers were eaten than with a diet of perch and pikeperch, which leave more fish debris. We suggest the hypothesis that ingested feathers, in the absence of other indigestible matter, contribute substance to the stomach content, enabling the formation of pellets that can be ejected. The habit of regularly ejecting the stomach contents minimizes the chance that any serious population of gastric parasites will build up in the upper part of the alimentary tract.

J	Viherluoto, M; Viitasalo, M				Viherluoto, M; Viitasalo, M			Temporal variability in functional responses and prey selectivity of the pelagic mysid, Mysis mixta, in natural prey assemblages	MARINE BIOLOGY												Predation rates and prey selection of the pelagic mysid shrimp, Mysis mixta, were studied experimentally in the northern Baltic Sea in 1998 during their most intensive growth period, from June to October. Functional responses during 5 months were determined by providing the mysids with a natural zooplankton assemblage, diluted to several different concentrations. The results show that ingestion rate increased, along with mysid growth, from early summer to autumn and that saturation level was reached between 400 and 500 mug C 1(-1). Ingestion rates increased with increasing prey concentration, and sigmoidal curves explained mostly the variation in ingestion rates (explanatory levels of 86-97%). Prey selection was evident in June, July and August, though weaker during the latter 2 months. Selection differed between the studied months but, generally, copepods were more positively selected than cladocerans. Rotifers were the main prey during June and July, when mysids were small, while larger mysids fed on copepods and cladocerans. Of the copepods, Eurytemora affinis was a truly selected species. This study shows that mysids feed on many zooplankton taxa and that they undergo ontogenetic diet shifts.

Paleo aridity in the Levant driven by a strong North Atlantic latitudinal surface temperature gradient and present- day relevance	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The mechanisms underlying the current greenhouse gas (GHG) forced decline in Mediterranean rainfall remain a matter of debate. To inform our understanding of the current and projected drying, we examined extended arid intervals in the late Quaternary, Eastern Mediterranean (EM) Levant indicated by substantial salt deposits in a Dead Sea sediment core covering the past 220 kyr. These arid events occurred during interglacials, when the Earth was at perihelion to the sun in boreal fall and during glacial-interglacial transitions, associated with icesheet melting. Climate models forced with realistic late Quaternary insolation variations show that when the Earth is closest to the Sun in boreal fall, the North Atlantic latitudinal surface temperature gradient in the winter intensifies. In response, the overlying midlatitude North Atlantic jet stream and the extratropical storm track move poleward while sea- level pressure rises in the subtropics. These changes bring about a weakening of the Mediterranean storm track and a decline in rainfall over the entire basin. During glacial-interglacial transitions, meltwater from continental icesheets forced abrupt subpolar North Atlantic cooling. This also strengthened the latitudinal surface temperature gradient, likely causing similar atmospheric response and aridity in the Mediterranean. There is a strong resemblance between this paleoclimate scenario and the climatic changes corresponding to the present and projected GHG drying of the EM. Hence, the late Quaternary palaeohydrology of the Dead Sea indicates an important North Atlantic centered response to external forcing, which leads to Mediterranean drying and is relevant in the present.					; Kushnir, Yochanan/B-4472-2013; Goldsmith, Yonaton/IST-2224-2023; Biasutti, Michela/G-3804-2012	Goldsmith, Yonaton/0000-0003-0398-9005; Kushnir, Yochanan/0000-0003-3312-5160; Biasutti, Michela/0000-0001-6681-1533													0027-8424	1091-6490				NOV 19	2024	121	47							e2407166121	10.1073/pnas.2407166121	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2407166121								39527735					WOS:001368604800007

However, understanding of the pattern of dunefield changes near the northern limit of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) since Middle to Late Holocene Transition (MLHT, similar to 6 to 4 ka) is still lacking. Here, we compile and analyze the sedimentology and chronology of regional dune and lake records in the Hunshandake Sandy Land (HSL). Based on prior work and confirmed by additional OSL and 14C ages, paleosol development intercalated with dune sand is found southeastern and central parts of the HSL after 4 ka. However, based on new chronological data, a paleosol complex is generally absent in the northwestern HSL after 4 ka. Together with independent high-resolution transient model simulations of summer rainfall change, we interpret a shift of the far northwestern HSL dunefield system approximately coincided with the mid-summer limit of the EASM rainbelt that retreated southward after 4 ka. Thus, we hypothesize that the southward migration of the northernmost monsoonal rainbelt after the MLHT was a first-order control on dunefields change over the far northwestern HSL. Coupled with a southward migrating rainbelt, we interpret a decrease in external sand supply (due to covering by clay) and an increase in contemporaneous seasonal eolian deflation caused by the drier hydroclimatic conditions. This climatic-driven dune system shift in the far northwestern HSL is shortly after the more globally recognized 4.2 ka event, which marks the boundary between the Middle Holocene and Late Holocene.

We synthesized the literature and used remote-sensing techniques to review the types, distribution, characteristics, causes and frequency of major glacial hazards along the Karakoram Highway. We found that the glacier-related hazards could be divided into direct and indirect hazards, including glacier surges, glacial lake outburst floods, and glacial floods, which are concentrated in East Pamir and the Hunza River Basin. In the past 100 years, hazards from glaciers surges and glacial floods only occurred once and twice, respectively, which appear suddenly, with the hazard-causing process being short-lived and occurring mainly in the summer. Glacial lake outburst floods mainly occur in the spring and summer in the Hunza River Basin. Among these, ice-dammed lakes have the highest frequency of flooding, their formation and outbursts being closely related to the sudden advancement of surge-type glaciers. Under the background of global climate warming, we speculate that the glacier surge cycle may shorten and the frequency of the formation and outbursts in the glacial lakes may increase. In the future, we should combine models and new field observations to simulate, and deepen our understanding of the physical mechanisms of different glacier-related hazards. In particular, on-site monitoring should be carried out, to include the evolution of glaciers subglacial hydrological systems, the thermal state at the base of the glaciers, and the opening and closing of drainage channels at the base of the ice dams.					; Xie, Fuming/ABD-3175-2020; wu, kunpeng/GXW-1032-2022; 高, 永鹏/IST-6791-2023; Liu, Shiyin/AAT-4278-2020; zhu, yu/ABD-2058-2020	Xie, Fuming/0000-0002-1935-121X; ZHU, YU/0000-0002-0895-8147; LIU, Shiyin/0000-0002-9625-7497														2296-6463				FEB 16	2021	9								611501	10.3389/feart.2021.611501	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2021.611501													WOS:000623612200001

Consequently the lake is highly enriched but with an annual cycle of algal P-limitation in winter and N-limitation in summer. There have been several schemes proposed to accelerate the improvement of the lake's water quality for recreational use. A computer hydraulic and nutrient model of Lake Horowhenua was developed using rainfall, evaporation and nutrient data to describe the nutrient budget. To match the lake nutrient concentrations, terms for in-lake processes of sedimentation, seasonal sediment nutrient release, phytoplankton production, and denitrification were required. The computer model results indicated that denitrification was the major natural restoration process accounting for a net loss of more than 50% of the N from the lake each year. Application of the model also allowed lake managers to evaluate the potential effects of a number,of proposed restoration schemes.																			0018-8158					FEB 25	1994	275						467	477		10.1007/BF00026735	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026735													WOS:A1994NB19800042

The cumulative ecological risk of HMs in sediments reached extremely strong level, mainly Cd and Hg. The main sources of HMs in sediments are mining sources, mixed agricultural and transport sources, and natural sources, which contributed 42.1 %, 34.1 % and 23.8 %, respectively.					; Chen, Zhenyu/AAA-6776-2022	Chen, Zhenyu/0000-0002-8800-3286; 													0025-326X	1879-3363				AUG	2024	205								116621	10.1016/j.marpolbul.2024.116621	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2024.116621		JUL 2024						38964187					WOS:001265907200001

In contrast, total nitrogen (TN) deposition was related to rainfall and did not follow the pattern observed for PM and TP. The molar TN: TP ratio was significantly lower (i.e., phosphorus-enriched) in dry deposition (TN vs. TP slope = 11.2) than in wet deposition (TN vs. TP slope = 95.5). In the study lakes, the molar TN: TP ratios and the Chl a concentrations were significantly influenced by the molar TN: TP ratio and the TP content of atmospheric deposition, respectively. Lake responses were more pronounced in the more phosphorous-limited system. These results establish a direct connection between atmospheric deposition and lake nutrient status and Chl a, making evident that in the Mediterranean region these inputs are an important source of phosphorous affecting biogeochemistry of oligotrophic systems.					; Reche, Isabel/K-7120-2014	Morales Baquero, Rafael/0000-0002-7075-7899; Pulido, Elvira/0000-0002-5436-2133; Reche, Isabel/0000-0003-2908-1724													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2006	51	2					830	837		10.4319/lo.2006.51.2.0830	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2006.51.2.0830													WOS:000236343600004

Effect of low temperatures on mortality and oviposition in conjunction with climate mapping to predict spread of the root weevil Diaprepes abbreviatus and introduced natural enemies	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												The tropical root weevil, Diaprepes abbreviatus (L.), has been a pest of citrus and ornamental plants since its introduction into Lake County, FL, in 1964. Since then, it has colonized the Florida peninsula to the south of its point of introduction but has not expanded its range to the north. A lower threshold for oviposition by D. abbreviates was estimated as 14.9 degrees C. Eggs were highly susceptible to cold, with 95% mortality (LTime(95)) occurring in 4.2 d at 12 degrees C. Relative susceptibility of life stages to cold was eggs > pupae > larvae > adults. Archived weather data from Florida were examined to guide a mapping exercise using the lower developmental threshold for larvae (12 degrees C) and the lower threshold for oviposition (15 degrees C) as critical temperatures for mapping the distribution of D. abbreviates and the potential for establishment of egg parasitoids. Probability maps using the last 10 yr of weather data examined the frequency of at least 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 d per winter when soil temperature was <= 12 degrees C. The geographic area that experienced between 15 and 20 d per winter with mean daily soil temperature <= 12 degrees C closely approximated the northern limit of D. abbreviates in Florida. Homologous maps of Arizona, California, and Texas predict the areas where soil temperatures favor establishment of D. abbreviatus. Successful establishment of egg parasitoids in Florida seems to be limited to southern Florida, where mean daily air temperatures fall below 15 degrees C < 25 d/yr. By this measure, we predict that egg parasitoids will not establish in Arizona, California, or Texas.																			0046-225X					FEB	2007	36	1					73	82		10.1603/0046-225X(2007)36[73:EOLTOM]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X(2007)36[73:EOLTOM]2.0.CO;2								17349119					WOS:000244116100011

Early work by forest entomologists (Miller 1927, Miller 1960; Rasmussen et al. 1996, Salman 1934) established a direct relationship between fire injury and subsequent insect attack in burned-over areas. Initial concern has centered on the primary tree killers Dendroctonus spp. and Scolytus ventralis LeConte. This research is also finding that Dendroctonus valens and lps pini are causing tree mortality with both fall and spring prescribed burns. Post-burning bark beetle induced mortality can be quite significant as demonstrated by two case studies presented here from Lassen Volcanic National Park and Spooner Summit, Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit. From these two sites, inferences are made on the effect of seasonality for predisposing trees to particular bark beetles. In comparing these two populations, there was no significant difference in the mean number of trees killed by insects in each seasonal window. As case studies, not enough replicates existed to merit a more rigorous analysis. As such, management implications of post-burning bark beetle response are discussed given the information available on fire-insect interactions during these two seasonal windows.																									2002		29					143	158																WOS:000185594700015

Comparative algological and bacteriological examinations on biofilms developed on different substrata in a shallow soda lake	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												According to the European Water Framework Directives, benthic diatoms of lakes are a tool for ecological status assessment. In this study, we followed an integrative sample analysis approach, in order to find an appropriate substratum for the water qualification-oriented biomonitoring of a shallow soda lake, Lake Velencei. Six types of substrata (five artificial and one natural), i.e., andesite, granite, polycarbonate, old reed stems, Plexiglass discs and green reed, were sampled in May and in November. We analysed total alga and diatom composition, chlorophyll a content of the periphyton, surface tension and roughness of the substrata and carbon source utilisation of microbial communities. Water quality index was calculated based on diatom composition. Moreover, using a novel statistical tool, a self-organising map, we related algal composition to substratum types. Biofilms on plastic substrates deviated to a great extent from the stone and reed substrata, with regard to the parameters measured, whereas the biofilms developing on reed and stone substrata were quite similar. We conclude that for water quality monitoring purposes, sampling from green reed during springtime is not recommended, since this is the colonization time of periphyton on the newly growing reed, but it may be appropriate from the second half of the vegetation period. Stone and artificially placed old reed substrata may be appropriate for biomonitoring of shallow soda lakes in both spring and autumn since they showed in both seasons similar results regarding all measured features.

Franco) located near Shawnigan Lake, British Columbia. Treated plots were thinned or fertilized, or both; thinned plots had two-thirds of their basal area removed, fertilized plots were treated with 448 kg N.ha-1 of either urea or ammonium nitrate, and half the fertilized plots were refertilized at the same rate 9 years later. The annual rate of litter fall in control plots averaged 1890 kg.ha-1. In control plots significant yearly variations were observed in litter-fall mass and concentrations of K, Mg, and Ca but not N or P. Thinning decreased rates of litter fall by 80%, but rates returned to control-plot levels after 13-15 years in unfertilized plots and after 8-10 years in fertilized plots. Fertilization without thinning depressed litter fall in the year of treatment but increased the rate by 20-80% in subsequent years. Litter-fall N concentrations increased by 40-80% the year of fertilization and then began declining 3-6 years later. Nitrogen fertilization reduced litter-fall P, K, and Mg concentrations for 8, 4, and 1 year(s), respectively, following fertilization. The effects were greater in ammonium nitrate plots than in urea plots. Rates of litter fall correlated poorly with stand density but well with basal area and stemwood increment. Correlations with the latter two variables varied with time and treatment.

J	Beltaos, S				Beltaos, Spyros			The role of waves in ice-jam flooding of the Peace-Athabasca Delta	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES					Joint Meeting of the 32nd Annual Meeting of the Canadian-Geophysical-Union/Canadian-Society-of-Soil-Science	MAY 14-17, 2006	Banff, CANADA	Canadian Geophys Union, Hydrol Sect, Canadian Soc Soil Sci				Since the late 1960s, a paucity of ice-jam flooding in the lower Peace River has resulted in prolonged dry periods and considerable reduction in the area covered by lakes and ponds that provide habitat for aquatic life in the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) region. To identify the causes of this trend, and to develop mitigation or adaptation strategies under present and future climatic conditions, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms that lead to breakup of the ice cover and jamming within the delta reach of Peace River. Because the lower Peace is extremely flat, the long-period waves caused by spring snowmelt are not generally capable of dislodging the winter ice cover, even under conditions of very high flow. The ice cover decays in place and rubble generation, an essential condition for ice jamming, does not occur. However, major jams do, on occasion, form in the middle section of the river and make their way to the delta via repeated releases and stalls. Each release generates a steep wave which can greatly amplify the hydrodynamic forces that are applied on the ice cover and bring about its dislodgment. This is quantified for the lower Peace River by applying recently developed methodology to local hydrometric data. Detailed in situ observations in the spring of 2003, and additional data from 1997 and 2002, fully corroborate this conclusion. Implications to other flat rivers of northern Canada are discussed.

We used data from the United States National Lakes Assessments of 2007 and 2012 as well as data collected from several different studies of Canadian lakes. Using multiple regressions, we quantified the general observations that summer water temperatures decreased when going from south to north, from east to west, and from lower elevations to higher elevations. Our empirical model using 8-day average air temperatures, latitude, longitude, elevations and month was able to predict water temperatures in individual lakes on individual summer days with a standard deviation of 1.7 degrees C for United States lakes and 2.3 degrees C for lakes in the southern regions of Canada.

J	Jones, B; Renaut, RW				Jones, Brian; Renaut, Robin W.			Cyclic development of large, complex, calcite dendrite crystals in the Clinton travertine, Interior British Columbia, Canada	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Bands of large (up to 4 cm long) three-dimensional crystallographic dendrites form the terrace fronts in an old travertine mound exposed near Clinton, British Columbia. The dendrites, with their long axes perpendicular to the terrace front, are characterized by numerous levels of branching. Each branch is formed of multitudes of skeletal rhombs, four- and six(?)-sided bipyramidal crystals, or prismatic hexagonal crystals that are precisely aligned along crystallographic precepts. Although individual branches are formed of one type of suberystal, neighbouring branches may be formed of different subcrystal types. Highly supersaturated waters that were generated by rapid CO2 degassing of the spring water during its turbulent flow over the steep terrace fronts probably drove dendrite precipitation. The presence of growth lines indicates that growth was episodic. Type I growth lines probably fanned annually in response to seasonal climate changes whereas Type II growth lines, which formed less frequently, may reflect changes in the flow velocity and/or flow patterns of the spring waters. Early diagenetic modification of the dendrites involved crystal face enlargement, cements formed of trigonal prisms or needle-fiber crystals, microbial infestation that mediated substrate dissolution, and/or deposition of denital calcite crystals that formed in the water column. Much of the diagenetic modification may have taken place during the periods when the dendrites had temporarily stopped growing. The dendrites in the Clinton travertine are an excellent example of complex, episodic calcite crystal growth that was extensively modified by early diagenctic processes in a surface environment. The same spring waters from which the dendrites were precipitated mediated much of the early diagenesis. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	WRIGHT, RF				WRIGHT, RF			IMPACT OF FOREST FIRE ON NUTRIENT INFLUXES TO SMALL LAKES IN NORTHEASTERN MINNESOTA	ECOLOGY												The Little Sioux fire of May, 1971 burned most of the mixed coniferous-deciduous forest on the watersheds of Meander and Lamb lakes, two small, low conductivity lakes located in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area (BWCA) of NE Minnesota, USA. During 1972, hydrologic and chemical (Ca, Mg, K, Na, and P) budgets were determined for the terrestrial watersheds of Meander and Lamb lakes and for the lakes themselves. Budgets were also measured for Dogfish Lake, a lake physically and chemically similar to Meander Lake but whose watershed was not burned in the Little Sioux fire. These budgets show that the atmosphere supplies a significant fraction of the cations and P (Ca, 90%; Mg, 35%; K, 95%; Na, 55%; P, 95%) to the BWCA watersheds, with the remainder coming from chemical weathering. The budgets are similar to those reported for other Canadian Shield lakes and watersheds. The impact of the Little Sioux fire on nutrient fluxes was evaluated by comparing the budgets measured at Dogfish Lake with those measured at Meander Lake. This comparison showed that as a result of the burning of Meander Lake watershed, runoff increased 60% and the K and P exports increased 265% and 93%, respectively. The exports of Ca, Mg and Na did not change significantly. The increase in runoff, probably due to the reduction in vegetative transpiration, is comparable to that measured after the 1970 Entiat fire (western Washington) and to that resulting from clear-felling experiments at Hubbard Brook (New Hampshire) and Coweeta (North Carolina). The increased nutrient losses after fire are less than those observed at Hubbard Brook and Coweeta. There was no indication of a drastic increase in NO3 export such as occurred after the Entiat fire and at Hubbard Brook. The increase in P loading of Meander Lake due to the fire was 38% (to 25 mg/m2 .cntdot. yr), a value that probably falls within the natural year-to-year variation in supply, and it did not represent a major impact on Meander Lake. Fire is a natural part of the BWCA forest ecosystems. Nutrient losses after the Little Sioux fire were minimal, perhaps because it was a spring fire. Fall fires may cause larger nutrient losses because more of the forest-floor material is likely to be consumed and revegetation does not begin until the following spring.

Anders; Bronmark, Christer; Skov, Christian			Consequences of fish predation, migration, and juvenile ontogeny on zooplankton spring dynamics	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												In order to disentangle if and when resource supply and adult and young-of-the-year (0+) fish predation affect zooplankton dynamics during spring, we monitored zooplankton during three consecutive years in a lake in southern Sweden. We also experimentally assessed 0+ fish predation rates and estimated changes in predation rates of adult fish on zooplankton. Decline in abundances of large-sized zooplankters in early spring was not caused by 0+ fish predation. Instead, this decline was most likely a combined result of size-selective predation from adult fish (stationary in the lake and from those returning from surrounding streams) and competition for diminishing algal food resources. On the other hand, the decline in medium-sized zooplankton in the lake during spring was strongly affected by 0+ fish. Hence, during spring, zooplankton are facing predation both from adult fish selecting large prey and from 0+ fish, which start feeding on small-sized prey and eventually switch to larger. Neither predation by different ontogenetic stages of fish (adult and 0+) nor resource supply shape the zooplankton spring dynamics, but rather they affect the timing and strength of these events. 0+ cyprinids tend to have stronger effect on zooplankton dynamics than other taxa of 0+ fish. A combination of predation from adult and 0+ fish during spring is the main mechanism behind the crash of the zooplankton community, which in many lakes leads to the termination of the clear-water phase.

Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes were analyzed in POM, zooplankton, sedimentary organic matter, zoobenthos, and piscivorous fishes in pre- and post-summer monsoon periods. Sharp depletion of C-13 and enrichment of N-15 of POM along with elevated POC/Chl a ratios occurred following the summer monsoon period, reflecting the rapid reduction of phytoplankton biomass and a pulsed supply of terrestrial organic detritus. Herbivorous zooplankton C-13 values, which were initially similar to POM C-13 values in the pre-summer monsoon period, decreased to nearly that of terrestrial organic matter, providing isotopic evidence of allochthonous contribution to zooplankton in the post-summer monsoon period. In contrast, herbivorous zoobenthos in the littoral area and higher fishes appeared to have a similar stable isotope composition between the pre- and post-summer monsoon period. Our findings indicate that although monsoon storms dramatically decrease phytoplankton biomass, the augmented allochthonous material after the summer monsoon offsets this effect temporarily by subsidizing pelagic zooplankton production. Allochthonous subsidies to herbivorous littoral zoobenthos and piscivorous fishes are relatively limited.

Several greenhouses are nearby quarry lakes, which are the legacy of the expansion of cities in the last decades, including Turin (NW Italy). About 20 quarry lakes were excavated close to the Po riverbed in the southern part of this urban area, along a belt of more than 30 km in length, with an overall volume exceeding 10 million m(3) water. The study addresses these artificial lakes as a low enthalpy thermal energy source, potentially providing heat to surrounding agri-business buildings. Detailed temperature monitoring of a large lake quarry was conducted over two years at different depths, measuring the surrounding groundwater level as well. Two different behaviors of the lake during the winter and summer seasons enabled the definition of a quite low water mixing process between the surrounding aquifers and the lake (in the range of 2-4 degrees C). An evaluation of the heat extraction potential using the lake as a heat source, depending on water temperature and its volume, and a qualitative comparison with groundwater systems are proposed. This study contributes to increasing knowledge on an overlooked resource for sustainable heating.					; Mandrone, Giuseppe/ADZ-1473-2022; Chicco, Jessica Maria/AAG-9428-2019	Mandrone, Giuseppe/0000-0002-5397-9377; Comeau, Felix-Antoine/0000-0003-3983-7943; Casasso, Alessandro/0000-0001-6685-1383; Raymond, Jasmin/0000-0002-7486-9185; Chicco, Jessica Maria/0000-0001-6877-5425; 														2073-4441				DEC	2021	13	24							3560	10.3390/w13243560	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13243560													WOS:000737306100001
J	FJELDSA, J				FJELDSA, J			BIOLOGICAL NOTES ON THE GIANT COOT FULICA-GIGANTEA	IBIS												The giant coot is generally a local and sparse bird in Andean lakes at 3100-5000 m. One of the localities, Lake Lagunillas in southern Peru, contained 600-650 nesting pairs increasing the known population markedly. The enormous offshore nests are completely open to view. They begin as floating structures but as they increase in size, rest on the bottom like islands. Since the central parts of large nests turn into compact peat, they are probably used for years in succession. Thriving breeding populations may require extensive shallows with dense weeds such as Myriophyllum and Potamogeton at the water surface. New materials are added to the high nest-rim as long as pairs have young and this serves as a continuing food supply for the chick, permitting them to stay dry and sheltered during bad weather. The threat behavior differs markedly from that of other coots studied. The main breeding season is in the austral winter when there is intense cold every night, with 2nd broods in spring and some laying at other seasons. Development appears very slow. Territorial adults seem sedentary and flightless. The species disperse through nocturnal flights, probably by immatures which have not yet obtained full weight.

Particularly, as a result of freezing fresh water in inland, many bird species use coastal wetlands to spend the winter. The aim of this study was to determine the wintering waterbird species at Sarikum Lake and to evaluate the importance of Sarikum Lake for waterbirds. In this study a 17 years data obtained by point counts from the mid-winter waterbird census between the years 1993 and 2018 was evaluated. According to this study, 56 wintering waterbird species belonging to 14 families and 10 orders, have been determined so far. Six of these species listed as globally threatened according to the IUCN criteria. maximum of 38 waterbird species and a maximum of 18,112 individuals were counted in a specific year. The most dominant species were Anas platyrhmehos, Anas crecca, Aythya fuligula, Fulica atra and Aythya ferina, respectively.

Environmental changes in the eastern Arctic 1.6975-1.965 Ma, palynological investigations from El'gygytgyn Lake, northeastern Russia	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												The 1.6975-1.965 Ma (MIS 60-MIS 74) portion of the El'gygytgyn Lake record includes two key chrono-stratigraphic markers in the Calabrian-Gelasian boundary (1.806 Ma) and the Olduvai paleomagnetic excursion (1.77-1.95 Ma). It also provides the first paleovegetation information for these times from the eastern Arctic. Palynological data indicate the dominance of Larix forest and forest-tundra during warm and cool intervals, which differs sharply from the herb tundra which characterized glacial intervals of the Middle and Late Pleistocene. These forests likely included tree species of Betula and Alnus and perhaps Populus and Chosenia. The persistence of Larix indicates summer temperatures were warmer than present. Pinus pumila, a typical interglacial taxon, is restricted to MIS 65 and MIS 71, suggesting other intervals experienced dry winters. Cool and warm periods are clearly marked by vegetation changes during the Late Gelasian Stage, but a dominance of Poaceae pollen and reduction in Alnus pollen during the Early Calabrian Stage mutes the climatic fluctuations. The loss of Alnus perhaps relates to decreases in seasonal temperatures. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Taking the water diversion project from the Yangtze River to Lake Taihu (WDYT) as an example, we explored the temporal effects of WDYT on the phytoplankton community and physicochemical habitat of Lake Taihu in autumn and winter from 2013 to 2018. Although the short-term diversion significantly increased the risk of importing nutrients, the relatively high quality of the diversion water compared with other inflow rivers had improved the water quality of the water-receiving lake region. The seasonal water diversion significantly increased phytoplankton diversity and community network complexity and reshaped the lacustrine community to be diatom-dominated with their relative proportions of 24.1-64.9% during water diversion periods. The contributions of physicochemical habitat changes induced by water diversion to variations in phytoplankton communities were 24.0-28.0%. The differences in phytoplankton diversity, community composition and physicochemical habitat in the water-receiving lake region between the diversion and non-diversion years were more evident than those between the non-diversion years in the same season, when comparing the multivariate dispersion indices among them. However, the lacustrine phytoplankton community during non-diversion periods still has not been essentially altered after several years of diversion, so the pulse effects of short-term water diversion were more obvious than the long-term cumulative impacts. Better control of allochthonous nutrients, appropriate increase in inflow water, adhering to the long-term operation, should be effective to enhance ecological benefits of such water diversion projects.					xu, jiayi/HDO-5387-2022; Tian, Fuwei/LZF-3393-2025; Ptak, Mariusz/O-3217-2015; ZHANG, YU/IRZ-5949-2023; Wang, Fangfang/KII-9109-2024	Ptak, Mariusz/0000-0003-1225-1686; Gao, ang/0009-0008-8745-4895; Zhu, Senlin/0000-0003-2803-5419; 													0269-4042	1573-2983				JUN	2023	45	6					3025	3039		10.1007/s10653-022-01383-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-022-01383-w		SEP 2022						36136253					WOS:000858956700001

Lake Diefenbaker is a large reservoir on the Canadian Prairies. Annual flow volume from its major tributary, the South Saskatchewan River (SSR), varies with precipitation and temperature in the Rocky Mountains. Furthermore, plans are underway to increase water abstraction from Lake Diefenbaker for irrigation. Therefore, we used a nine-year dataset that comprised a drought year (1984), four consecutive high flow years (2011 to 2014), and four subsequent low flow years (2015 to 2018) to investigate how these changes could affect the major phytoplankton groups and cyanobacterial community. Diatoms (38.5%) were the most abundant phytoplankton, followed by cryptomonads (28.9%) under low and high flow years. Diatoms were associated with greater mixing in late spring and fall, whereas the cryptomonads were related to the high nutrients from spring flow. Cyanobacteria (79.3%) contributed the greatest to the total phytoplank-ton biomass under drought; we hypothesized that the high abundance of cyanobacteria during drought was associated with thermocline deepening and subsequent internal loading of nutrients. Microcystis, a potential bloom-forming and toxin -producing genus, was dominant during the drought and correlated with reduced water level, increased air temperature, and moderate wind speed. Although its biomass was low, another potential bloom-forming and toxin-producing genus, Aphanizomenon, was present in low and high flow years. Aphanizomenon was correlated with decreased SSR flow and increased particulate carbon to particulate phosphorus ratios, which may be related to their ability to cope with P limitation. These results highlight that Lake Diefenbaker and other similar reservoirs are vulnerable to an increase in potential toxic cyanobacteria species with future expectations of climate warming and water abstraction.

Rising global temperatures and the increasing frequency of climate extremes pose significant challenges to waterbird conservation. These effects might be mitigated by managing habitat heterogeneity through diverse water levels in waterbird habitats. East Dongting Lake (EDL), a critical wintering site within the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, has experienced a significant drop in winter water levels due to extreme drought and operation of the Three Gorges Dam. This study aimed to determine optimal water levels for supporting waterbird populations under these changing conditions. 2. We examined winter waterbird populations at EDL from 2004 to 2021. Species were categorised into five foraging guilds based on established criteria. Environmental variables comprised daily water levels from the Chenglingji hydrological station, meteorological data from ERA5-Land, and the 6-month Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) for drought severity assessment. We used a generalised additive model (GAM) with a negative binomial distribution to analyse the relationships between waterbird abundance and these factors, applying GAIC-based stepwise selection and varying-coefficient functions to account for guild-specific responses. 3. In controlled areas of EDL, higher maximum water levels (MaxWL) during the wet season were positively correlated with waterbird abundance, while controlled areas also maintained high waterbird numbers during extreme drought years, providing crucial habitat refuges. In uncontrolled areas, MaxWL and SPEI positively influenced waterbird abundance, while minimum water levels (MinWL) and biological accumulated temperature (BioT) were negatively associated. 4. In lakes where water levels can be regulated, regulation can be used to maintain habitat heterogeneity and food availability for wintering waterbirds. By adjusting local water management strategies within lake ecosystems, wetland managers can use these findings to support waterbird conservation efforts.

Pairing and nesting increased with average age of the flock, but fertility, hatching and fledging were variable among years, suggestive of an environmental influence. For climatic variables measured during the incubation period, only maximum soil temperature was associated with the failure of late nests in dry years. However, pre-nesting winter precipitation and water elevation were positively correlated with air index of nesting effort. Winter precipitation was associated with fertility and hatchability, whereas winter marsh water levels were associated with earlier nesting dates and increased egg volume. Both winter precipitation (>8 cm mean monthly) and water elevation (>20.3 in above mean sea level or 68% of full marsh surface area or perimeter) greater than a threshold level appeared to be good predictors for successful reproduction in central Florida, but Occurred together in only four often study period years. Pairs delayed nesting, had smaller eggs, and hatched and fledged fewer chicks in years with low winter water elevation. Low winter precipitation associated with decreased fertility of eggs may explain the failure of fully incubated nests to hatch in some years. Insufficient stimulation of the neuroendocrine system due to limited rainfall and poor physiological condition due to poor food resources in low water marshes ate proposed mechanisms for low fertility and delayed nesting and egg size, respectively. Drought appears to encourage birds to use lake edges for nesting which have increased hazards. Thus, conservation of wetlands for cranes should include (feel) marshes and lake edges with controlled boat usage during the nesting season. Further investigation is recommended for pre-nesting and incubation behaviors, diseases of eggs, and egg volumes. Received 2 June 2008, accepted 29 January 2009.

J	Catsadorakis, G				Catsadorakis, Giorgos			Establishment and growth of a new Dalmatian Pelican Pelecanus crispus colony in Central Greece	ACTA ORNITHOLOGICA												Although many waterbirds breed in colonies, documented colonisation events are rare. I studied the establishment and growth of a new breeding colony of the globally Near Threatened Dalmatian Pelican Pelecanus crispus at the newly created Karla Reservoir, Central Greece, between 2012 and 2017. The reservoir began filling with water in 2009. The first pelicans were observed in 2009 and numbers increased to 950 in June 2015. Since then the occurrence pattern changed and numbers fluctuated seasonally, being high during breeding and almost zero during summer and autumn. The first pair bred in 2011 and breeding pairs reached 445 in 2017, becoming the second largest colony of Dalmatian Pelican in Europe and manifesting an annual growth rate of 176.4%. The high rate of increase and re-sightings of ringed and tagged Dalmatian Pelicans suggest that colonisers must have been immigrants from the nearest two colonies in Kerkini Reservoir and/or Lake Prespa (northern Greece). Breeding success ranged from 0.54 to 0.88 young/nest, which is low for the species. Both the change in occurrence pattern and the low breeding success must be attributed to reasons other than nesting conditions. From a conservation point of view this new breeding colony may act as an ecological trap for Dalmatian Pelicans, as low water quality will probably continue favouring conditions leading to mass pelican mortality.																			0001-6454	1734-8471				AUG	2019	54	1					125	132		10.3161/00016454AO2019.54.1.010	http://dx.doi.org/10.3161/00016454AO2019.54.1.010													WOS:000495363400010
J	Lal, K; Menon, S; Noble, F; Arif, KM				Lal, Kartikay; Menon, Sanoj; Noble, Frazer; Arif, Khalid Mahmood			Low-cost IoT based system for lake water quality monitoring	PLOS ONE												Water quality monitoring is a critical process in maintaining the well-being of aquatic ecosystems and ensuring growth of the surrounding environment. Clean water supports and maintains the health, livelihoods, and ecological balance of the ecosystem as a whole. Regular assessment of water quality is essential to ensure clean and reliable water is available to everyone. This requires regular measurement of pollutants or contaminants in water that can be monitored in real-time. Hence, this research showcases a system that consists of low-cost sensors used to measure five basic parameters of water quality that are: turbidity, total dissolved solids, temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen. The system incorporates electronics and IoT technology that are powered by a solar charged lead acid battery. The data gathered from the sensors was stored locally on a micro-SD card with live updates that could be viewed on a mobile device when in proximity to the system. Data was gathered from three different bodies of water over a span of three weeks, precisely during the seasonal transition from autumn to winter. We adopted a water sampling technique since our low-cost sensors were not designed for continuous submersion. The results show that the temperature drops gradually during this period and an inversely proportional relationship between pH and temperature could be observed. The concentration of total dissolved solids decreased during rainy periods with a variation in turbidity. The deployed system was robust and autonomous that effectively monitored the quality of water in real-time with scope of adding more sensors and employing Industry 4.0 paradigm to predict variations in water quality.

Winter home range and habitat selection differs among breeding populations of herring gulls in eastern North America	MOVEMENT ECOLOGY												Background: Recognizing the factors influencing migratory individuals throughout their annual cycle is important for understanding the drivers of population dynamics. Previous studies have found that Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) in the Atlantic region have lower survival rates than those in the Great Lakes and the Arctic. One possible explanation for divergent survival rates among these populations is differences in their non-breeding habitats. Methods: We tracked Herring Gulls from five populations, breeding in the eastern Arctic, the Great Lakes, Newfoundland, Sable Island, and the Bay of Fundy. We assessed the extent of migratory connectivity between breeding and wintering sites, and tested if there were differences in home range size or habitat selection among these populations during the winter. Results: The tracked Herring Gulls had strong migratory connectivity between their breeding and wintering areas. We found that Herring Gulls from the Arctic spent most of the winter in marine habitats, while the other populations used a wider variety of habitats. However, the Newfoundland and Sable Island populations selected for urban habitats, and almost all individuals the specialized in urban habitats came from one of the three Atlantic populations. Conclusions: Our results suggest that there could potentially be a link between urban habitat use during the winter and reduced adult survival in Atlantic Canada Herring Gulls.

J	Nicholis, KH				Nicholis, KH			El Nino, ice cover, and Great Lakes phosphorus: Implications for climate warming	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Phosphorus concentrations in a 19-year record of the Lake Huron outflow (Laurentian Great Lakes of North America) were negatively correlated with the extent of Great Lakes winter ice cover. The highest phosphorus concentrations (2-3 times higher than normal) occurred during 1983, 1987, and 1992 in response to strong El Nino-related moderation of winter air temperatures. The 1983 winter air temperature anomaly of +2.5 degrees C (the mildest winter in the record) is well within the output of predicted temperature increases by general circulation models for the Great Lakes basin under a 2X CO2 climate warming scenario. Lake data from strong El Nino years, when contrasted with other years having near-normal winter temperatures and ice cover, can thus serve to identify some previously unanticipated impacts of global warming on lake water quality. I suggest that global warming may have important implications for eutrophication control in the Great Lakes.																			0024-3590					JUN	1998	43	4					715	719		10.4319/lo.1998.43.4.0715	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1998.43.4.0715													WOS:000075320300018

An Integrative Methodological Framework for Setting Environmental Criteria: Evaluation of Public Preferences	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS												The main objective of the present study is to introduce public preferences into the development of water-quality criteria that effectively balance environmental concerns and socioeconomic values. A novel feature of our research is the analysis of subjective public judgments with Bayesian inference techniques, which are ultimately connected with environmental conditions through mathematical modeling. Our case study is the Bay of Quinte, Ontario, Canada; an embayment at the northeastern end of Lake Ontario with a long history of eutrophication, characterized by frequent and spatially extensive algal blooms and predominance of toxic cyanobacteria. In this study, we present a major survey to determine public opinions on water quality in the area. Our survey was conducted among a random sample of 1527 local residents and tourists during the summers of 2013 and 2014. The key findings of the survey were: (i) fishing (29%) and beauty of the area (20%) were the main reasons for public use of the Bay of Quinte; (ii) among different water-quality problems, the public chose the algal scums (26%) and the integrity of fish populations (22%) as the main issues; (iii) only 30% of the returning visitors noticed that the clarity of water is better now relative to the prevailing conditions five years ago; (iv) there is a dramatic change in public sentiment between the beginning and end of the summer season; and (v) a substantial portion of local residents were willing to contribute financially towards the restoration of the bay. Our modeling analysis suggests that the likelihood of public satisfaction increases significantly when the total phosphorus concentrations fall below the critical levels of 20-25 mu g L-1, which however is a difficult target to achieve even under significantly reduced nutrient-loading conditions. Other biological variables such as chlorophyll a concentrations, harmful algal blooms, and toxin levels in locations frequently used by the public appear to more closely influence their satisfaction level.					; KELLY, NOREEN/H-7628-2019; Kim, Dong-Kyun/O-3813-2016; Arhonditsis, George/C-6980-2009	Arhonditsis, George/0000-0001-5359-8737; Kelly, Noreen/0000-0002-5432-5658; Javed, Aisha/0000-0002-8516-6370; 													0921-8009	1873-6106				MAY	2018	147						298	311		10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.01.009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.01.009													WOS:000428008000026

In situ measurements confirm the seasonal dominance of benthic algae over phytoplankton in nearshore primary production of a large lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Despite the recognition of its importance, benthic primary production is seldom reported, especially for large lakes. We measured in situ benthic net primary production by monitoring flux in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration in benthic incubation chambers, based on continuous measurements of CO2(aq) flux, alkalinity, and the temperature-dependent dissociation constants of carbonic acid (K-1 and K-2). This methodology has the advantages of monitoring net primary production directly as change in carbon, maintaining continuous water recirculation, and having sufficient precision to detect change in DIC over short (i.e. 15 min) incubations, even in alkaline waters. 2. Benthic primary production on Cladophora-dominated rocky substrata in western Lake Ontario was measured biweekly. Maximum biomass-specific net photosynthetic rates were highest in the spring (2.39 mgC g Dry Mass(-1) h(-1)), decreased to negative rates by early summer (-0.76 mgC g DM-1 h(-1)), and exhibited a regrowth in late summer (1.98 mgC g DM-1 h(-1)). 3. A Cladophora growth model (CGM), previously validated to predict Cladophora biomass accrual in Lake Ontario, successfully simulated the seasonality and magnitude of biomass-specific primary production during the first cohort of Cladophora growth. Averaged over this growing season (May-Aug), mean areal net benthic production at the estimated depth of peak biomass (2 m) was 405 mg C m(-2) d(-1). 4. We measured planktonic primary production in proximity to the benthic study and constructed a depth-resolved model of planktonic production. Using the CGM, benthic primary production was compared with planktonic primary production for the period May-Aug. Net benthic production from the shoreline to the 12 m contour (1-2 km offshore) equalled planktonic production. Closer to shore, benthic primary production exceeded planktonic primary production. Failure to account for benthic primary production, at least during abundant Cladophora growth, will lead to large underestimates in carbon and nutrient flows in the nearshore zone of this Great Lake.

Chimney-Like Intense Pelagic Upwelling in the Center of Basin-Scale Cyclonic Gyres in Large Lake Geneva	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Basin-scale quasi-geostrophic gyres are common features of large lakes subject to Coriolis force. Cyclonic gyres are often characterized by dome-shaped thermoclines that form due to pelagic upwelling that takes place in their center. At present, the dynamics of pelagic upwelling within the surface mixed layer (SML) of large lakes are poorly documented. A unique combination of high-resolution 3D numerical modeling, satellite imagery and field observations allowed confirming, for the first time in a lake, the existence of intense pelagic upwelling in the center of cyclonic gyres under strong shallow (summer) and weak deep (winter) stratified conditions/thermocline. Field observations in Lake Geneva revealed that surprisingly intense upwelling from the thermocline to the SML and even to the lake surface occurred as chimney-like structures of cold water within the SML, as confirmed by Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer data. Results of a calibrated 3D numerical model suggest that the classical Ekman pumping mechanism cannot explain such pelagic upwelling. Analysis of the contribution of various terms in the vertically averaged momentum equation showed that the nonlinear (advective) term dominates, resulting in heterogeneous divergent flows within cyclonic gyres. The combination of nonlinear heterogeneous divergent flow and 3D ageostrophic strain caused by gyre distortion is responsible for the chimney-like upwelling in the SML. The potential impact of such pelagic upwelling on long-term observations at a measurement station in the center of Lake Geneva suggests that caution should be exercised when relying on limited (in space and/or time) profile measurements for monitoring and quantifying processes in large lakes.

The results indicated that most of the nutrient concentrations in both the water column and the sediment varied temporally and showed significant spatial differences. The peak values of most of the physico-chemical parameters measured were obtained during the summer or autumn, whereas the opposite result was observed for suspended solids. A higher zooplankton density and lower phytoplankton biomass were observed in ponds than in other sampling sites, whereas Cyanophyta (80 %), with Planktothrix rubescens as the dominant taxon, was predominant in the canal closest to the ponds. The benthic community was dominated by Bellamya aeruginosa in the ponds. Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri was the predominant species in the canal. Comparative analysis of the impact of crab culture showed that it produced a relatively low level of disturbance but introduced large quantities of nutrients and organic matter into the canal around the farming ponds. The introduction of these substances increased the risk that Guchenghu Lake would be affected by pollution.

After the preliminary survey, birds surveyed from vantage points at each study site between the years 2016 and 2020 in the winter season. A total of 58 bird species belonging to nine orders and 13 families were observed. The study showed variation in effective species numbers (Species richness, Shannon's diversity and Simpson's diversity) among the three study sites and the survey years. Nanji National Nature Reserve had the highest avian diversity, whereas Duchang Provincial Nature Reserve had the lowest. Globally threatened bird species, Siberian Crane (critically endangered), Oriental Stork (endangered), found in our study sites. However, the current management practices of the nature reserve and conservation of this globally threatened bird species are inadequate, especially of Duchang Provincial Nature Reserve. Therefore, for long term conservation of birds in these areas, it needs continuing intentional improvement of the sites and awareness creation to the local community.

Monitoring of the moskva river water using microbiological parameters and chlorophyll a fluorescence	MICROBIOLOGY												The results of investigations of three Moskva River sites with different degrees of pollution using a complex of microbiological characteristics and the parameters of chlorophyll a fluorescence are presented. We determined that the bacterioplankton seasonal dynamics at less polluted waters (Tushino and Vorob'evy Gory) were similar but differed significantly from one in more polluted waters (Dzerzhinskii). The number of bacteria with active electron transport chain, as well as their share in the bacterioplankton structure, was higher in the water of Dzerzhinskii (average annual values of 0.23 x 10(6) cells/mL and 14%) than that in the less polluted water of Tushino and Vorob'evy Gory (0.14 x 10(6) cells/mL; 6% and 0.15 x 10(6) cells/mL; 7%, respectively). From April to October, the content of chlorophyll a and its photosynthetic activity were the highest in Tushino. In Dzerzhinskii, during spring the increase in photosynthetic activity commenced earlier and was more intensive that the increase in chlorophyll a content; i.e., the increase in phytoplankton biomass was temporarily suppressed. We suggest association of this phenomenon with suppression of organic matter synthesis by phytoplankton due to the high water pollution in Dzerzhinskii. The second autumn peak of chlorophyll a content, which was typical of clear water and was observed in Tushino, did not occur in Dzerzhinskii. We recommend combined application of these microbiological parameters and characteristics of chlorophyll a fluorescence for further monitoring.

Diel activity patterns in overwintering Labrador anadromous Arctic charr	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Anadromous Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, migrate back to freshwater in late summer to spawn and/or overwinter. While seasonal movement patterns during the freshwater residency period are generally understood, specifics of the short temporal activity patterns remain poorly characterized. This study used temperature and accelerometer sensing telemetry to describe the diel activity patterns of 21 overwintering anadromous Arctic charr in a lake in southern Labrador, Canada. Tagged individuals displayed diurnal activity patterns throughout the overwinter residency period marked by greater activity during the day than at night and distinctive peaks of activity at the beginning and the end of each daylight period. Diurnal patterns were interpreted as driven by prey and light availability in the upper water column because of known linkages between light and foraging efficiency. Movement activity also increased as a function of temperature during the spawning and ice breakup periods, but not during winter when increased movement activity was correlated with colder temperatures. No association was found between movement activity and body size over the size range (36.0-48.5 cm) of fish studied. Our data suggest a complex set of behavioural determinants of overwinter activity, among which temperature and foraging are the most significant.					; Fleming, Ian/I-7217-2012	Fleming, Ian/0000-0002-5541-824X; Mulder, Ingeborg/0000-0003-1699-9077; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2019	840	1			SI		89	102		10.1007/s10750-019-3926-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-019-3926-7													WOS:000479052700008

It can have an effect on fish populations. To evaluate the effect of climatic change on coldwater fish habitat in cold regions of China, a fish habitat simulation model was developed. The fish habitat simulation model was developed based on the output of a deterministic, unsteady, one-dimensional, year-round lake water quality model (MINLAKE2012). Lake Jingpo in Northeast China was chosen as the represent lake. The coldwater stenothermal fish called Hucho taimen was selected as the indicator species. Constant Values Method and oxythermal habitat parameter (TDO) method were applied to identify the refuge habitat. Weather records for period 1980-2012 were used to represent past climate conditions. Future climate SERS-A1B scenarios were based on the output of the Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM), CCCma CGCM3.1 from the Canadian Climate Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis (CCCma), and the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate, MIROC3.2 developed in Japan. The simulation results show that under the future climate scenarios, the uninhabitable space in winter due to low dissolved oxygen in hypolimnion will decrease, the uninhabitable space in summer due to high temperature in epilimnion will expand. Total habitat depth in summer is projected to decrease up to 60% - 90%, which means highly probability of summer kill. It is projected that multi-year average value of ATDO3(vb) (highest average daily TDO3 over variable benchmark period) will have an increase of about 2.5 degrees C, which means Hucho taimen juvenile survival rate will decrease about 35%. In the extreme warm year, the Hucho taimen juvenile survival rate will decrease to 9.0%.

Estimating future temperature maxima in lakes across the United States using a surrogate modeling approach	PLOS ONE												A warming climate increases thermal inputs to lakes with potential implications for water quality and aquatic ecosystems. In a previous study, we used a dynamic water column temperature and mixing simulation model to simulate chronic (7-day average) maximum temperatures under a range of potential future climate projections at selected sites representative of different U.S. regions. Here, to extend results to lakes where dynamic models have not been developed, we apply a novel machine learning approach that uses Gaussian Process regression to describe the model response surface as a function of simplified lake characteristics (depth, surface area, water clarity) and climate forcing (winter and summer air temperatures and potential evapotranspiration). We use this approach to extrapolate predictions from the simulation model to the statistical sample of U.S. lakes in the National Lakes Assessment (NLA) database. Results provide a national-scale scoping assessment of the potential thermal risk to lake water quality and ecosystems across the U.S. We suggest a small fraction of lakes will experience less risk of summer thermal stress events due to changes in stratification and mixing dynamics, but most will experience increases. The percentage of lakes in the NLA with simulated 7-day average maximum water temperatures in excess of 30 degrees C is projected to increase from less than 2% to approximately 22% by the end of the 21st century, which could significantly reduce the number of lakes that can support cold water fisheries. Site-specific analysis of the full range of factors that influence thermal profiles in individual lakes is needed to develop appropriate adaptation strategies.					; Butcher, Jonathan/D-2280-2012	Butcher, Jonathan/0000-0002-1894-4419; Zi, Tan/0000-0002-8422-2537; Johnson, Thomas E./0000-0003-4073-938X													1932-6203					NOV 9	2017	12	11							e0183499	10.1371/journal.pone.0183499	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183499								29121058					WOS:000414769900004

The following factors were considered: land use, soil type, lake density, precipitation and air temperature over a 10-year period, as well as precipitation chemistry, river-bed morphology, and use of riverside zone. As shown by the results, the small proportion of arable lands with the large proportion of forests and lakes in the catch-ment, as well as the afforested river banks create favourable conditions for reducing the inflow of nutrients to the Warta water. It was also found that air temperature in the summer half-year considerably affects the concentration of Kjeldahl nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, total phosphorus and phosphates in river water, while precipitation in the winter half-year contributes to the washout of nitrate nitrogen from the catchment.

Total enzymatic activity (TEA) ranged between 0.2 and 19.1 nmol l(-1) h(-1) in the reservoir and between 0.8 and 12.4 nmol l(-1) h(-1) in the lake. High-affinity (K-m < 1 mu mol l(-1)) and low-affinity (K-m > 100 mu mol l(-1)) enzymes were kinetically identifiable in most samples from both localities. The low-affinity enzyme activity (LEA) usually accounted for >60% (mean: 80%) of TEA. LEA and diatom biomass significantly correlated over time in the reservoir epilimnion (r(s) = 0.578) and in the lake metalimnion (r(s) = 0.862). As diatoms possess chitin and take up its monomer, N-acetylglucosamine, two explanations of the observed relationships are suggested: extracellular beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity partly originates either from ectoenzymes of chitinolytic bacteria attached to diatom cells or from ectoenzymes of diatoms, enabling them to take up N-acetylglucosamine from ambient amino sugars instead of synthesizing it de novo. A significant positive correlation of LEA with crustacean abundance was found in the lake epilimnion (r(s) = 0.850), apparently reflecting the growing spring populations of frequently moulting juvenile crustaceans. A possible contribution of chitinolytic bacteria, accompanying the crustacean populations, to LEA is discussed.					; Šimek, Karel/AAB-1956-2021; Vrba, Jaroslav/M-3780-2013; Macek, Miroslav/B-5428-2015; Pernthaler, Jakob/A-2257-2008	Simek, Karel/0000-0002-7058-9063; Vrba, Jaroslav/0000-0003-2145-9024; Macek, Miroslav/0000-0003-0600-3539; Pernthaler, Jakob/0000-0001-7558-909X; 													0020-9309						1997	82	2					277	286		10.1002/iroh.19970820213	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19970820213													WOS:A1997XK40000010
J	Catto, N; MacQuarrie, K; Hermann, M				Catto, N; MacQuarrie, K; Hermann, M			Geomorphic response to Late Holocene climate variation and anthropogenic pressure, northeastern Prince Edward Island, Canada	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					INQUA Holocene Commission Meeting	MAR-APR -, 2000	SEVILLE, SPAIN					Geomorphic response provides an index to climate change and variability. Differing time scales of both weather/climate events and landform response complicate interpretation. Anthropogenic modification, particularly in coastal and aeolian dune environments. represents a further geomorphic influence. Northeastern Prince Edward Island (PEI). Canada, is a marine dominated environment subjected to rising sea level throughout the late Holocene. The combination of rising sea levels, increased anthropogenic utilization of the coast for residential, and tourism purposes, and limited offshore winter ice conditions have resulted in accelerated erosion and degradation of the dunes and coastline. The aeolian succession indicates that temporal and spatial transitions from isolated shield dunes to parabolic dunes to linked coastal transverse dune complexes are characteristic of the coastal dune fields. Sand supply is the most significant control on dune morphology, development, and extent. Superimposed dome dunes and shield dunes are prevalent in areas of anthropogenic disturbance. Dune migration along the coastal zone has varied considerably, with rates locally in excess of 10 m/a over short times. Winters marked by relatively limited sea ice and scarce snow cover, resulting from more temperate winter conditions, allow increased erosion by strong storms. Deflation of dune crests and development of blowouts is notably accentuated along human trails. The climate variations recorded in Atlantic Canada over the past decade fall within the range of those recorded previously within the twentieth century, and thus do not indicate conclusive evidence of a pronounced trend of climate change in this region. However, analysis of northeastern PEI demonstrates that dune coastlines can evolve rapidly in response to short-term and intermediate-term climate variation, particularly when coupled with anthropogenic pressure. Similar geomorphic effects in combination with climate variation and storm activity should be anticipated along other dune coastlines that have been subjected to intense anthropogenic utilization during earlier periods of the Quaternary.

The concentrations of the clay and clay-plus-fine-silt fractions are inferred to reflect the water-level status of the lake basin related to the intensity of the Indian summer monsoon and high concentrations reflect high lake levels resulting from the intensified summer monsoon. The frequency of individual lacustrine mud beds is considered to reveal the frequency of the lakes developed in the basin associated with the variability of the Indian summer monsoon and an increased frequency of the lakes reveals an increased variability of the summer monsoon. The proxy data indicate that the Indian summer monsoon experienced two major shifts at 3.57 and 2.78 Ma and two secondary shifts at 3.09 and 2.39 Ma during the Pliocene. The summer monsoon displayed a general trend of gradual intensification during the period of 3.57-2.78 Ma, coeval with an accelerated uplift of the Tibetan Plateau, implying a close link between the monsoon intensification and the plateau uplift. At 2.78 Ma, the summer monsoon was markedly weakened, synchronous with the formation of extensive Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, denoting a quick response of the monsoon regime to the Northern Hemisphere glaciation. The variability of the summer monsoon decreased at 3.09 Ma and increased at 2.39 Ma, presumably suggesting that variations of the Indian monsoon would be modulated by the initiation and periodic fluctuations of ice-sheet covers in Northern Hemisphere high latitudes.

However, given that Lake Manzala suffers from major environmental and fisheries problems, an ambitious national project for the dredging, purification, and development of this lake was established in 2017. Hence, this study was conducted to assess seasonal diversity and to provide an inventory of fish species at Lake Manzala during dredging operations. Five seasonal surveys were conducted during the period from 2019 to 2021. By using different fishing gears and methods operating in the lake, a total of 7774 fish and crustaceans-belonging to 29 fish species and three crustacean species that clump into 21 families-were collected from Lake Manzala. During the study period, the family Cichlidae showed the highest occurrence of about 70%. The marine-brackish species recorded the highest aquatic environment (milieu) diversity with 34.4% of the collected species, but only 12.5% of the freshwater species. Six of the collected fish species were recorded of Indo-pacific origin, as Lissepsian migrant species. In this study, the diversity index (H) was calculated, ranging between 1.13 and 1.77. As indicated by the seasonal variation of the diversity index, the highest diversity index of Lake Manzala was evident in autumn 2019 and spring 2021 at 1.700 and 1.365, respectively. The governmental dredging and cleaning operations in the lake have a relative impact on the species composition in this area. Further studies are recommended after the completion of these operations to confirm the impact of dredging on species composition alteration.

J	Steinhart, GB; Wurtsbaugh, WA				Steinhart, GB; Wurtsbaugh, WA			Winter ecology of kokanee: Implications for salmon management	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We sampled various limnological parameters and measured growth and diet of age-0 kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka (lacustrine sockeye salmon) during two winters in a high-mountain lake of the Sawtooth Valley, Idaho. Although winter has been recognized as an important period for many warmwater fishes and for stream-dwelling salmonids, winter limitations have only recently been studied for coolwater and coldwater species. Ice and snow cover in winter limited light penetration. As a result, chlorophyll-a and zooplankton density were lower in ice-covered periods than during ice-free periods. The weight of stomach contents was often below a maintenance ration, yet the incidence of empty stomachs was extremely low (I of 63) and the weight of stomach contents increased as energy reserves declined, indicating that kokanee were actively foraging during winter. Kokanee length and weight remained constant during the winter of 1993-1994 but increased from November through May in 1994-1995. Condition factors, however, declined significantly over the winter in both years, and lipid content approached levels associated with mortality. Differences in growth patterns may have been caused by a combination of changes in zooplankton density and kokanee abundance and in kokanee behavior to defend energy reserves or avoid predation. Results demonstrated the ambiguity of some growth measurements and the importance of choosing the correct metric for measuring growth in fishes. Because juvenile kokanee and sockeye salmon are ecologically similar, management efforts to restore the endangered Snake River sockeye salmon to the Sawtooth Valley lakes should recognize that winter conditions might be a bottleneck for this species.

The Balsjo paired catchment study examined the outputs of methylmercury (MeHg) and total mercury (Hg(tot)) from two boreal catchments during the 2 y following forest harvest but prior to site preparation. This enabled us to separate the effect of the two operations that followed best management practices. Hg(tot) concentrations increased by approximately 15%, and fluxes by 20-30%. The MeHg concentrations and fluxes either declined or increased by up to 60%, depending on whether annual MeHg peaks during summer low flows were considered to have been influenced by forest harvest. The lack of a severalfold increase in Hg outputs after forest harvest, as reported from other sites, may be the result of minimal soil disturbance during the winter forest harvest operations.

The Tecopa basin is a groundwater discharge area along the Amargosa River drainage basin south of the Nevada Test Site and proposed high-level nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, NV. The spring waters are categorized into three end-member hydrochemical facies: (1) pH-neutral, Na + Ca + Mg + SO4 + HCO3 water with moderate to high total-dissolved solids;, (2) mildly alkaline, Na + Cl + SO4 + HCO3 water with high total dissolved solids; and (3) alkaline, Na + HCO3 + CO3 water with high total dissolved solids. The temperatures of most of the springs range from 17 degreesC to 32 degreesC; however, waters in the Tecopa Hot Spring area range from 9 degreesC to 47 degreesC. The oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions (normalized to SMOW) of the waters are as follows. The facies 1 springs have a mean delta O-18 of - 12.77 +/- 0.14%o (1 sigma) and delta D of - 94.9 +/- 0.5%(o) (1 sigma). The facies 2 springs have a mean delta O-18 of - 12.73 +/- 0.19%o (1 sigma) and delta D of - 97.7 +/- 0.9%o (1 sigma). The facies 3 spring has a mean delta O-18 of - 13.09 +/- 0.17%o (1 sigma) and delta D of - 103.5 +/- 0.7%o (1 sigma). The mean boron concentrations and isotope compositions range from 2.4 mg/l and delta (11) B of + 2.5%o for facies I springs to 72.8 mg/l and delta (11) B of - 3.8%o for the facies 3 spring. The facies I waters have chemical and isotope compositions consistent with meteoric recharge in the Spring Mountains, NV, groundwater flow through the regional carbonate aquifer, and minor mixing with more concentrated water. The thermal, facies 2 waters are isotopically and chemically distinct from waters in the regional basin-fill and carbonate aquifer systems. These waters are interpreted to originate from fractured water-bearing strata beneath the regional carbonate aquifer that discharge only in the southernmost part of the Great Basin. The facies 3 spring is isotopically and chemically similar to basin-fill aquifer waters in the Amargosa Desert, but has higher sodium, alkalinity, and boron contents due to interaction with saline, alkaline-lake deposits of the Plio-Pleistocene Lake Tecopa beds. Geologic, geochemical, and isotope data suggest that these three distinct water types flow through hydrogeologic compartments in the Tecopa basin. The compartments are interpreted to have been created by the impermeable Lake Tecopa beds and geologic structures within the basin. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

A diluted lithium chloride solution was injected into the lake during holomictic conditions in order to favour the homogeneous distribution of the tracer. The exponential decline of the mass of lithium in the lake revealed a water residence time of 1.5 to 3 months for summer and almost no lake water exchange during winter. Lithium concentrations ranged from background values of 0.06 mug l(-1) to about 3 mug l(-1) immediately after the tracer injection. Lake water samples were analyzed with ion-exchange chromatography using a Dionex device with a CS 12A separation column. The method detection limit determined according to the definition of the US Environmental Protection Agency amounted to 0.009 mug l(-1). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Park, GS; Marshall, HG				Park, GS; Marshall, HG			The trophic contributions of rotifers in tidal freshwater and estuarine habitats	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Distribution patterns and trophic contributions of rotifers from freshwater through polyhaline estuarine waters were examined in the southern Chesapeake Bay and its major tributaries for a two-year period. Trichocerca marina and Synchaeta spp. were the major taxa in abundance, followed by Polyarthra vulgaris, Keratella cochlearis and Brachionus spp. There was a significant negative correlation between salinity and rotifer density, biomass, and number of species. Rotifers were a component of the microzooplankton biomass during specific periods and at particular sites, dominating summer assemblages in tidal freshwater and river-estuary transition sites, plus the winter communities in estuarine waters. This observation indicates that rotifers may play an important trophic role by seasonally replacing metazoan nauplii as a biomass source in both tidal freshwater and estuarine ecosystems. The annual contribution of rotifers to the total microzooplankton biomass exclusive of heterotrophic dinoflagellates was brief but intensive, achieving over 50% of annual biomass during a 2-3 month period. Despite the small annual mean contribution of rotifers to the total microzooplankton biomass, rotifers may have a limited, but significant impact on the trophic dynamics of the zooplankton community in Chesapeake Bay and its major tidal tributaries.

The volume weighted mean (VWM) Hg(T) concentration and cumulative Hg(T) flux were 8.8 ng L-1 and 9.4 mu g m(-2) per year, respectively. The VWM Hg(T) concentration varied seasonally, similar to the seasonal pattern in atmospheric Hg(p) concentration. The enhancement of both VWM Hg(T) and atmospheric Hg(p) concentrations in spring and winter was likely caused by the long-range transport of Hg from China. Monthly VWM Hg(T) and atmospheric Hg(p) concentrations were well correlated (R-2 = 0.36); however, there was no correlation between VWM Hg(T) and RGM (reactive gaseous mercury) concentrations, suggesting that Hg(p) was responsible for the majority of the Hg in wet deposition at this site. The VWM Hg(T) concentration in snow was statistically higher than in rain. In addition, the atmospheric Hg(p) concentration appeared to be elevated for snow events as well. This suggests that both elevated Hg(p) concentrations and the enhanced scavenging efficiency of snow for Hg(p) were responsible for the elevated VWM Hg(T) concentrations measured during snow events.																			1464-0325	1464-0333				OCT	2011	13	10					2748	2754		10.1039/c1em10014a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1em10014a								21863180					WOS:000295579000009
J	Buck, U; Grossart, HP; Amann, R; Pernthaler, J				Buck, Ulrike; Grossart, Hans-Peter; Amann, Rudolf; Pernthaler, Jakob			Substrate incorporation patterns of bacterioplankton populations in stratified and mixed waters of a humic lake	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												P>Bacterial incorporation of glucose, leucine, acetate and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (HBA) was investigated in an artificially divided humic lake (Grosse Fuchskuhle, Germany). Two basins with contrasting influx of allochthonous organic carbon were sampled during late summer stratification (oxic and anoxic layers) and after autumn mixing. High total and cell-specific incorporation rates were observed for glucose and HBA in stratified and mixed waters respectively, but only a small fraction of bacteria visibly incorporated HBA. The oxic layer of the more humic-rich basin featured a significantly lower fraction of glucose incorporating cells and substantially higher proportions of acetate assimilating bacteria. Niche differentiation was observed in two betaproteobacterial populations: cells affiliated with the Polynucleobacter C subcluster efficiently incorporated acetate but little glucose, whereas the opposite was found for members of the R-BT065 clade. By contrast, leucine incorporation was variable in both taxa. Considering the high concentrations and rapid photochemical generation of organic acids in humic waters our results may help to explain the success of the Polynucleobacter C lineage in such habitats. Specific substrate or habitat preferences were also present in three subgroups of the actinobacterial acI lineage: The numerically dominant clade in oxic waters (acI-840-1) was absent in the anoxic zone and did not incorporate acetate. A second group (acI-840-2) was found both in the epi- and hypolimnion, whereas the third one (acI-840-3) only occurred in anoxic waters. Altogether our results suggest a constitutive preference for some substrates versus an adaptive utilization of others in the studied microbial groups.					; Pernthaler, Jakob/A-2257-2008; Amann, Rudolf/C-6534-2014; Grossart, Hans-Peter/E-6705-2017	Pernthaler, Jakob/0000-0001-7558-909X; Amann, Rudolf/0000-0002-0846-7372; 													1462-2912	1462-2920				JUL	2009	11	7					1854	1865		10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.01910.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.01910.x								19320716					WOS:000267660700021

Extreme variability of cyanobacterial blooms in an urban drinking water supply	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Harmful cyanobacterial blooms are of increasing global concern and their prediction and management requires an improved understanding of the controlling factors for cyanobacterial growth and dominance. In Lake St Charles, the drinking water supply for Quebec City, Canada, harmful cyanobacterial blooms were first recorded in autumn 2006. Our aims were to define the temporal and spatial variations in the cyanobacterial community structure of this reservoir and to address the hypothesis that interannual variability in cyanobacterial biomass and species composition is mainly controlled by nutrients, temperature and water column stratification. Over five consecutive summers (20072011), the north basin had consistently higher concentrations of bloom-forming cyanobacteria than the south basin, and there were striking variations within and among years in total biomass and species composition. Correlation analysis underscored the contrasting environmental controls on different taxa of colonial cyanobacteria. Anabaena flos-aquae biovolume was correlated with surface temperature, water column stability (Schmidt index) and water residence time whereas Microcystis aeruginosa was highly correlated with total phosphorus and to a lesser extent with total nitrogen (TN), heat accumulation (degree-days above 20C) and precipitation. Aphanocapsa/Aphanothece correlated significantly only with TN. These results also imply the sensitivity of high through-flow reservoir ecosystems to interannual variations in environmental forcing.					; Warren, Ann Marie/GLQ-8977-2022	Laurion, Isabelle/0000-0001-8694-3330; Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; 													0142-7873	1464-3774				JUL-AUG	2013	35	4					744	758		10.1093/plankt/fbt042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbt042													WOS:000321068100004

Age-Structured Assessment of Walleyes, Saugers, and Naturally Produced Hybrids in Three Missouri River Reservoirs	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Walleye Sander vitreus and sauger Sander canadensis naturally hybridize in many populations, but the factors influencing the recruitment of hybrids are unknown. We determined relative year-class strength for 1,454 saugers, walleyes, and naturally produced hybrids from three Missouri River reservoirs. Hybridization rates varied from 4% in Lakes Sharpe and Francis Case to 21% in Lewis and Clark Lake. Hybrids comprised multiple year-classes in each system, indicating that hybridization does not occur in erratic pulses but at a consistent low-level recruitment rate. The year-class strength of hybrids was not correlated with that of either walleyes or saugers. Our models suggest that higher than average recruitment of walleyes, saugers, and hybrids can be expected during years with warmer spring and early summer water temperatures in Lake Sharpe and Lewis and Clark Lake and during years when inflow (from main-stem discharge for hybrids and tributary inputs for saugers and walleyes) is reduced in Lewis and Clark Lake.

This study analyzed the spatiotemporal variability of water quality and algal biomass in Erhai Lake from 1994 to 2021 using water quality index (WQI), Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope combined methods. The potential causes of water quality deterioration and algal biomass dynamics were also elucidated. The results showed that the historical changes in the water environment of Erhai Lake mainly had three stages: satisfactory (1994-2001), deteriorating (2002-2010) and improving (2011-2021). The changes in water quality and algal biomass were primarily affected by total nitrogen, total phosphorus and chemical oxygen demand in different stages. The water environment of Erhai Lake is currently improving significantly, starting in the southern area that is furthest from the sources of agricultural pollution, especially in summer and autumn. This is attributed to the implementation of control measures resulting in lower pollutant loads at particular times and places. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to promote standardized livestock farming, to strengthen rural wastewater collection and to investigate measures such as the interruption of the endogenous cycle.					; WANG, SHANSHAN/OKS-5896-2025	Wu, Yue/0000-0002-1248-9005; 													2095-7505	2095-977X				DEC	2023	10	4					566	578		10.15302/J-FASE-2023520	http://dx.doi.org/10.15302/J-FASE-2023520													WOS:001148516000002

Microcystin, a representative cyanobacterial hepatotoxin, is frequently detected in most Korean lakes and reservoirs. This study developed predictive models for cyanobacterial bloom using artificial neural networks (ANNs; self-organizing map [SOM] and multilayer perceptron [MLP]), including an evaluation of related environmental factors. Fourteen environmental factors, as independent variables for predicting the cyanobacteria density, were measured weekly in the Daechung Reservoir from spring to autumn over 5 years (2001, 2003-2006). Cyanobacterial density was highly associated with environmental factors measured 3 weeks earlier. The SOM model was efficient in visualizing the relationships between cyanobacteria and environmental factors, and also for tracing temporal change patterns in the environmental condition of the reservoir. And the MLP model exhibited a good predictive power for the cyanobacterial density, based on the environmental factors of 3 weeks earlier. The water temperature and total dissolved nitrogen were the major determinants for cyanobacteria. The water temperature had a stronger influence on cyanobacterial growth than the nutrient concentrations in eutrophic waters. Contrary to general expectations, the nitrogen compounds played a more important role in bloom formation than the phosphorus compounds.

Geochemical analysis of Blood Falls outflow resembles concentrated seawater remnant from the Pliocene intrusion of marine waters combined with products of weathering. The result is an iron-rich, salty seep at the terminus of Taylor Glacier, which is subject to episodic releases into permanently ice-covered Lake Bonney. Blood Falls influences the geochemistry of Lake Bonney, and provides organic carbon and viable microbes to the lake system. Here we present the first data on the geobiology of Blood Falls and relate it to the evolutionary history of this unique environment. The novel geological evolution of this subglacial environment makes Blood Falls an important site for the study of metabolic strategies in subglacial environments and the impact of subglacial efflux on associated lake ecosystems.

Considerable concentrations of triphenyltin (TPT), diphenyltin (DPT), and monophenyltin (MPT) were found for the first time in all the compartments. In addition, tributyltin (TBT), dibutyltin (DBT), and monobutyltin (MBT) occurred in significant concentrations. During 1988-1990, aqueous TBT concentrations followed a seasonal pattern with increases of up to 752 ng/L in late spring, followed by a successive decrease until winter, when concentrations remainded around 100 ng/L. TPT and TBT concentrations decreased during the observation period. Of the total aqueous TBT, 95-99% was present in the dissolved phase. In mussels Dreissena, TPT and TBT residues ranged up to 3.88 and 9.35-mu-g/g, respectively. Vertical sediment core profiles showed highest TPT and TBT concentrations of up to 107 and 2043-mu-g/kg, respectively, in the top with decreasing values with depth. Dating of the core and the occurrence of only low concentrations of DBT and MBT indicate that TBT is conserved in these sediments over a time period of years.																			0013-936X					MAY	1991	25	5					956	963		10.1021/es00017a020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00017a020													WOS:A1991FK08300026

J	Zillén, L; Snowball, I				Zillen, Lovisa; Snowball, Ian			Complexity of the 8 ka climate event in Sweden recorded by varved lake sediments	BOREAS												Mineral magnetic and carbon analyses of a continuous varved lake sediment sequence in west-central Sweden (Lake Motterudstjarnet) complement similar palaeoclimate proxies obtained from two varved lake sediment sequences in northern Sweden and one in central Finland. The varve chronology is supported by tephrochronology, palaeomagnetic secular variations and C-14 AMS dating of terrestrial macrofossils. We apply a simple model in which the transport and deposition of catchment mineral matter reflect the amount of winter snow accumulation, spring snow-melt and stream discharge. Our data show that winter snow accumulation was generally enhanced in Sweden between 8100 and 7750 cal. yr BP. If dating errors are taken into account, the 350-year period of increased erosion is the geomorphic response to a multi-centennial scale climatic cooling that occurred some time between 8500 and 7500 cal. yr BP. The most significant erosion event in central Sweden was centred at 8050 cal. yr BP. It lasted 150 years (between 8100 and 7950 cal. yr BP) and is equivalent to the most extreme Holocene climate anomaly in the northern hemisphere, known as the 8 ka or 8200 cal. yr BP climate event. Our high-resolution paramagnetic susceptibility and ferrimagnetic grain-size parameters suggest that snowpack accumulation increased most significantly in northern Sweden between 7900 and 7750 cal. yr BP. We suggest that this north-south difference was a response to the re-establishment of moisture-laden westerly air masses, as meridional Atlantic overturning circulation was re-established at the beginning of the Holocene thermal maximum.

Snowmelt Timing as a Determinant of Lake Inflow Mixing	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Snowmelt is a significant source of carbon, nutrient, and sediment loads to many mountain lakes. The mixing conditions of snowmelt inflows, which are heavily dependent on the interplay between snowmelt and lake thermal regime, dictate the fate of these loads within lakes and their ultimate impact on lake ecosystems. We use five decades of data from Lake Tahoe, a 600 year residence-time lake where snowmelt has little influence on lake temperature, to characterize the snowmelt mixing response to a range of climate conditions. Using stream discharge and lake profile data (1968-2017), we find that the proportion of annual snowmelt entering the lake prior to the onset of stratification increases as annual snowpack decreases, ranging from about 50% in heavy-snow years to close to 90% in warm, dry years. Accordingly, in 8 recent years (2010-2017) where hourly inflow buoyancy and discharge could be quantified, we find that decreased snowpack similarly increases the proportion of annual snowmelt entering the lake at weak to positive buoyancy. These responses are due to the stronger effect of winter precipitation conditions on streamflow timing and temperature than on lake stratification, and point toward increased nearshore and near-surface mixing of inflows in low-snowpack years. The response of inflow mixing conditions to snowpack is apparent when isolating temperature effects on snowpack. Snowpack levels are decreasing due to warming temperatures during winter precipitation. Thus, our findings suggest that climate change may lead to increased deposition of inflow loads in the ecologically dynamic littoral zone of high-residence time, snowmelt-fed lakes. Plain Language Summary Winter climate conditions can affect both the timing of snowmelt and the timing of spring lake warming. Relative stream-lake temperature is an important control on how inflow plumes mix through lakes, distributing nutrients, carbon, and sediment relevant to lake ecosystems and water quality. This study examines how snow conditions have affected relative stream-lake temperature, and thus inflow mixing conditions, over the past 50 years at Lake Tahoe. Years of lower snowpack are found to favor nearshore and near-surface mixing of snowmelt inflows. Given trends toward reduced snowpack due to a warming climate, this result may indicative of future conditions in large, snowmelt-fed lakes.					; Hook, Simon/D-5920-2016; Forrest, Alexander/C-3765-2014	Roberts, Derek/0000-0003-1604-1803; Hook, Simon/0000-0002-0953-6165; Forrest, Alexander/0000-0002-7853-9765													0043-1397	1944-7973				FEB	2018	54	2					1237	1251		10.1002/2017WR021977	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017WR021977													WOS:000428474500032

Such records are particularly important due to the relative paucity of detailed palaeoclimate data from the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes. This paper presents outcomes of a study of the sedimentation processes of this temperate lake setting. Hydrometeorological, limnological and sedimentological data were collected over a 14 month period between 2011 and 2013. These data indicate that seasonality in the hydrometeorological system in combination with internal lake dynamics drives a distinct seasonal pattern of sediment dispersal and deposition on a basin-wide scale. Sedimentary layers that accumulate proximal to the lake inflow at the northern end of the lake form in response to discrete inflow events throughout the year and display an event stratigraphy. In contrast, seasonal change in the lake system controls accumulation of light (winter) and dark (summer) laminations at the distal end of the lake, resulting in the preservation of varves. This study documents the key processes influencing sediment deposition throughout Lake Ohau and provides fundamental data for generating a high-resolution palaeoclimate record from this temperate lake.					; Levy, Richard/E-2477-2011; Forrest, Alexander/C-3765-2014; Roop, Heidi/KXA-4409-2024	Levy, Richard/0000-0002-8783-0167; Upton, Phaedra/0000-0003-4052-301X													0037-0746	1365-3091				APR	2015	62	3					826	844		10.1111/sed.12162	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sed.12162													WOS:000352545500009

Originating from Lake Mead source water, seven spring sites were sampled, varying in temperature from 25 to 55 degrees C. Amplicon-based high-throughput sequencing of twelve samples using 16S rRNA primers (hypervariable V4 region) revealed that most mats are dominated by cyanobacterial taxa, some but not all similar to those dominating the mats at other studied hot spring systems. 18S rRNA amplicon sequencing (V9 region) demonstrated a diverse community of protists and other eukaryotes including a highly abundant amoebal sequence related to Echinamoeba thermarum. Additional taxonomic and diversity metric analyses using near full-length 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequencing allowed a higher sequence-based resolution of the community. The mat sequence data suggest a major diversification of the cyanobacterial orders Leptolyngbyales, as well as microdiversity among several cyanobacterial taxa. Cyanobacterial isolates included some representatives of ecologically abundant taxa. A Spearman correlation analysis of short-read amplicon sequencing data supported the co-occurrences of populations of cyanobacteria, chloroflexi, and bacteroidetes providing evidence of common microbial co-occurrences across the Black Canyon hot springs.

J	FALL, PL; DAVIS, PT; ZIELINSKI, GA				FALL, PL; DAVIS, PT; ZIELINSKI, GA			LATE QUATERNARY VEGETATION AND CLIMATE OF THE WIND-RIVER RANGE, WYOMING	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Sediments from Rapid Lake document glacial and vegetation history in the Temple Lake valley of the Wind River Range, Wyoming over the past 11,000 to 12,000 yr. Radiocarbon age determinations on basal detrital organic matter from Rapid Lake (11,770 +/- 710 yr B.P.) and Temple Lake (11,400 +/- 630 yr B.P.) bracket the age of the Temple Lake moraine, suggesting that the moraine formed in the late Pleistocene. This terminal Pleistocene readvance may be represented at lower elevations by the expansion of forest into intermontane basins 12,000 to 10,000 yr B.P. Vegetation in the Wind River Range responded to changing environmental conditions at the end of the Pleistocene. Following deglaciation, alpine tundra in the Temple Lake valley was replaced by a Pinus albicaulis parkland by about 11,300 C-14 yr B.P. Picea and Abies, established by 10,600 C-14 yr B.P., grew with Pinus albicaulis in a mixed conifer forest at and up to 100 m above Rapid Lake for most of the Holocene. Middle Holocene summer temperatures were about 1.5 degrees C warmer than today. By about 5400 C-14 Yr B.P. Pinus albicaulis and Abies became less prominent at upper treeline because of decreased winter snowpack and higher maximum summer temperatures. The position of the modern treeline was established by 3000 C-14 yr B.P. when Picea retreated downslope in response to Neoglacial cooling.

This study shows that the changes in the Holocene summer monsoon can be divided into two main periods, based on climatic proxy records of lake sediments from the Sanjiaocheng section located at the NW boundary of the summer monsoon, Gansu Province. The early and middle Holocene was humid with stronger summer monsoon, while the late Holocene is dry with weak summer monsoon. Detailed results also show a series of millennial- and centennial-scale changes in the intensity of the summer monsoon, with a periodicity of 1600 years during the whole Holocene, and with a periodicity of 800 years during the early Holocene. Ten dry events during the Holocene are associated with the weakening of the summer monsoon. These rapid climatic changes may be representative of a global climatic change pattern during the Holocene.

J	TALLING, JF				TALLING, JF			DEPLETION OF CARBON-DIOXIDE FROM LAKE WATER BY PHYTOPLANKTON	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Photosynthetic activity of several planktonic algae can bring about markedly alkaline and CO2-depleted conditions in the surface waters of 2 English lakes with low alkalinity (0.2-0.5 meq l-1). Examples are described, chiefly connected with the late spring growth of Fragilaria crotonensis in Windermere South Basin and the late summer maxima of Ceratium hirundinella and Microcystis aeruginosa in Esthwaite Water. In both lakes the pH may rise at least 2 units above the air-equilibrium level (to > 10 in Esthwaite Water), and estimated concentrations of free CO2 [H2CO3] fall below 0.5 .mu.M. In Esthwaite Water, more than half of the total CO2 (CT) may be consumed. Rates of photosynthesis of 5 spp. (of Asterionella, Melosira, Fragilaria, Ceratium and Microcystis) in CO2-depleted and CO2-enriched media are described and compared. Uptake of CO2 by the same species was followed with pH-drift and pH-stat experiments, in lake water media at various levels of alkalinity, natural or modified. Nearly complete depletion could be achieved by populations of Ceratium, Microcystis and Fragilaria, sampled from alkaline lake phases. The final pH could then be raised by increase of alkalinity, but above pH 11 there was evidence of limitation by pH per se and hence more incomplete CO2 utilization. The relationship between uptake rate and the concentration of CO2-forms strongly indicated the direct utilization of HCO3 ions in these species, although at low pH the uptake of free (gaseous) CO2 might enhance rates, and was probably predominant for F. crotonensis. Asterionella and Melosira were capable of less complete CO2 depletion, and the kinetic data indicate a dependence upon free CO2 only, with a higher half-saturation constant (Kt) for the Melosira. Values of Kt are also influenced by the uptake capacity at saturation (Vmax); relationships with the total CO2 flux resistance and the CO2 compensation point are considered. The compension points for Asterionella and Melosira were generally much higher than the concentrations reached during maxima of algae (Microcystis and Ceratium) presumed capable of direct HCO3 utilization. The different responses may therefore be of significance for species succession and community composition. Some wider ecological implications are discussed.																			0022-0477	1365-2745					1976	64	1					79	121		10.2307/2258685	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2258685													WOS:A1976BM56000003
J	Butler, HG				Butler, HG			Temporal plankton dynamics in a maritime Antarctic lake	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Changes in abundance, diversity and productivity of plankton in a maritime Antarctic lake were studied between December 1994 and February 1996. There were large intra- and inter-annual fluctuations in population densities, which were related to changing physical and chemical parameters. The plankton included an abundant protozoan population, comprising at least 66 taxa. This is amongst the highest diversities so far reported for Antarctic lakes. Heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) were the most common, with densities between 4 x 10(4) and 1.5 x 10(7)1(-1), and were the largest contributors to total protozoan carbon biomass for most of the year. Ciliate abundance varied from 4.0 x 10(0) to 1.4 x 10(4)1(-1) and included taxa from several trophic levels. Numbers of naked amoebae were usually low but occasional patches of high density occurred. An anoxic sump developed in bottom waters at the end of the winter and this contained a distinct population of anaerobic HNF There was evidence that the excrement of increasing fur seal numbers in the lake catchment over the last 15 years is having an impact on the lake ecosystem. The Ch1-a maximum of 49 mu g 1(-1) and primary productivity of up to 40 mgC m(-3) h(-1) were significantly higher than those reported by previous studies of this lake and continental Antarctic lakes. Increased summer bacterial abundance and productivity, together with higher winter nutrient concentrations, were also noted.																			0003-9136					OCT	1999	146	3					311	339																WOS:000083610200003
J	Anderson, JT; Smith, LM; Haukos, DA				Anderson, JT; Smith, LM; Haukos, DA			Food selection and feather molt by nonbreeding American green-winged teal in Texas Playas	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												We examined whether intensity of feather molt influenced food selection of nonbreeding American green-winged teal (Anas crecca carolinensis) in the Southern High Plains of Texas from autumn to early winter 1994 (n = 104) and 1995 (n = 85). Invertebrates comprised 8-31% and seeds 69-92% of the foods consumed. by real. All age-ses cohorts of teal consumed. invertebrates in greater proportion than available and consumed seeds less than expected (P less than or equal to 0.01). Feather molt intensity (% sheathed feathers) was greater during wet (11.64 +/- 0.17% in 1995; (x) over bar +/- SE) than dry (3.61 +/- 0.14% in 1994) years (P < 0.001). Invertebrate consumption increased as feather molt intensity increased for adult males and juvenile females (P < 0.001). Because teal selected invertebrates over seeds and molt intensity was greater when invertebrates were more abundant, natural foods, especially invertebrates, may be an important proximate factor related to feather molt intensity and nutrient-reserve acquisition of nonbreeding green-winged teal in the Southern High Plains. Wetland management for nonbreeding waterfowl should incorporate strategies for production of invertebrates and seeds.																			0022-541X					JAN	2000	64	1					222	230		10.2307/3802994	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3802994													WOS:000084785900026

The extent of warming is determined by system-specific characteristics such as fluvial input. Here we examine the impact of ongoing climate change on two alpine tributaries, the Aare River and the Rhone River, and their respective downstream peri-alpine lakes: Lake Biel and Lake Geneva. We propagate regional atmospheric temperature effects into river discharge projections. These, together with anthropogenic heat sources, are in turn incorporated into simple and efficient deterministic models that predict future water temperatures, river-borne suspended sediment concentration (SSC), lake stratification and river intrusion depth/volume in the lakes. Climate-induced shifts in river discharge regimes, including seasonal flow variations, act as positive and negative feedbacks in influencing river water temperature and SSC. Differences in temperature and heating regimes between rivers and lakes in turn result in large seasonal shifts in warming of downstream lakes. The extent of this repressive effect on warming is controlled by the lakes hydraulic residence time. Previous studies suggest that climate change will diminish deep-water oxygen renewal in lakes. We find that climaterelated seasonal variations in river temperatures and SSC shift deep penetrating river intrusions from summer towards winter. Thus potentially counteracting the otherwise negative effects associated with climate change on deep-water oxygen content. Our findings provide a template for evaluating the response of similar hydrologic systems to on-going climate change.					; Wuest, Alfred/L-2607-2014; Zappa, Massimiliano/C-1205-2009	Raman Vinna, Love/0000-0002-9108-8057; Bouffard, Damien/0000-0002-2005-9718; Zappa, Massimiliano/0000-0002-2837-8190													1027-5606	1607-7938				JAN 4	2018	22	1					31	51		10.5194/hess-22-31-2018	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-31-2018													WOS:000419243300002
J	WALI, AMA				WALI, AMA			SABKHAS OF THE BITTER-LAKES, EGYPT - COMPOSITION AND ORIGIN	CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES												Sabkhas adjoin the Bitter-Lakes area of Egypt (part of the Suez Canal complex), and occupy the topographic low areas east of the lakes. Each sabkha is subdivided into three zones: intertidal, transitional, and supratidal. Each of these zones has its own sedimentological characteristics, with a specific soil profile, and with marked transitional areas between them. The broad transitional zones arise from a seasonal areal expansion of the saline pools that occupy portions of the sabkha surface, particularly in winter. Thus, areas of mixed ancestry evolve because of the repeatedly shifting boundaries. Halite and gypsum are the main evaporitic minerals formed within the sabkha soil profiles. Gypsum is the major cementing material within the soil whereas halite is a summer precipitate in the ephemeral solar ponds and in the uppermost portion of the soil. Aragonite is associated with consolidated algal mats that display film, crenulated, and stratiform textures. The source of the water for the sabkha mostly is storm and tide-driven marine fluid. The peripheral part of the sabkha is in the flood recharge zone and receives a mixture of marine and non-marine waters, producing finely micritic dolomite. Chemical analysis of the sediments and brines confirm the mineralogical observations.																			0891-2556						1991	6	2					225	238		10.1007/BF03174425	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03174425													WOS:A1991GU83700008
J	Young, AL; Tallman, RF				Young, Angela L.; Tallman, Ross F.			The comparative lake ecology of two allopatric Arctic Charr, Salvelinus alpinus, populations with differing life histories in Cumberland Sound, Nunavut	ARCTIC SCIENCE												The lake ecology of high-latitude fishes is strongly influenced by seasonal feeding opportunities and environmental stochasticity in Arctic environments. Arctic Charr (Salvelinus alpinus (Linnaeus, 1758)) populations are prevalent throughout the Arctic and show multiple life history strategies across their range. Unlike Old World populations, the lake ecology of Arctic Charr populations on south Baffin Island remains poorly defined. We examined the comparative seasonal lake ecology of two differing Arctic Charr populations (anadromous and landlocked) in Cumberland Sound, Nunavut. Anadromous Charr showed no evidence of feeding occurring within freshwater once they began seaward migrations. Anadromous Charr achieve sexual maturation at a larger size and younger age than landlocked Charr. Landlocked Charr used more lake habitats than anadromous Charr with feeding opportunities as an apparent influence on habitat selection. Landlocked Charr fed year round. They adopted a cannibalistic feeding strategy in the winter but consumed a variety of prey items in the fall. Littoral habitat was found to be important to all sizes of Charr in both seasons. Smaller anadromous Charr (<350 mm) did not use the benthic habitat. The variable ecology and form demonstrated further emphasizes the phenotypic adaptability of Arctic Charr that allows its widespread distribution in the Arctic.																				2368-7460				JUN	2021	7	2			SI		471	493		10.1139/as-2019-0037	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/as-2019-0037													WOS:000672826800007

Phase 1 (6000-4700 cal. yr BP) revealed a wetter climate with a significant terrestrial input corresponding to the gradual strengthening of the westerlies. Phase 2 (4700-3900 cal. yr BP) reflects an overall improved westerly precipitation and autochthonous sources of organic matter (OM). Magnetic parameters also indicate higher lake levels and reducing conditions during this phase. Phase 2 was followed by a gradual diminishing pattern of the westerlies as also represented by phase 3 (3900-2500 cal. yr BP) and phase 4 (2500-1600 cal. yr BP) indicating moderate precipitation conditions, catchment stability, and temperate and/or cold-dry climatic conditions. Phase 5 (1600-500 cal. yr BP) revealed the prevalence of moderately cold/dry and further subdued westerly precipitation. Phase 6 (500 cal. yr BP to present) is represented by reduced westerly precipitation, shrinking lake margins, and significant terrestrial/anthropogenic controls over the lake basin. Mineral magnetic parameters indicate reducing lake bottom water conditions and eutrophication during this phase due to anthropogenic activities. These paleoenvironmental shifts reveal near synchronous changes (within dating uncertainties) with other regional paleoclimate records close to the present Anchar Lake location and reflect the gradual late-Holocene diminishment of the amount of winter/early summer moisture provided by the mid-latitude westerlies.					; Sharma, Rajveer/KFQ-3240-2024; Sangode, Satish/MBG-5274-2025; Kumar, Pankaj/M-8612-2015; Achyuthan, Hema/AAA-6898-2022; Lone, Aasif/AAA-2772-2021	Sangode, Satish/0000-0002-3433-977X; Sharma, Rajveer/0000-0003-0454-4753; Achyuthan, Hema/0000-0001-5495-4115; Kumar, Pankaj/0000-0001-7050-582X; Shah, Rayees Ahmad/0000-0002-3052-6391; LONE, AASIF/0000-0002-1517-2038													0959-6836	1477-0911				JAN	2020	30	1					23	36	0959683619865599	10.1177/0959683619865599	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683619865599		AUG 2019											WOS:000479999900001

Instantaneous fluxes of SIGMAPCB (sum of 80 congeners) were calculated from air and water samples collected simultaneously during short cruises in 1988,1990, and 1992. Volatilization fluxes dominated in late summer in warmer waters (15-22-degrees-C) while EPCBs were deposited into cool springtime waters (approximately 2-degrees-C). Seasonal fluxes were calculated using air samples collected at 12-day intervals over 2 years (1991-1992). Gas-phase SIGMAPCB exhibited two concentration maxima: in May and in August. The monthly average homolog concentrations were modeled as the sum of two Lorentzian functions and applied to the two-film gas-exchange model. The largest volatilization fluxes were calculated for fall, when water temperatures were relatively warm (7-10-degrees-C) and vapor PCB concentrations were low (approximately 65 pg/m3). Vapor deposition to Lake Superior is indicated from late April through May, into 0-3-degrees-C water when vapor SIGMAPCB concentrations peak at approximately 200 pg/m3. The annual SIGMAPCB flux from Lake Superior for 1992 is 250 kg/yr.

Water column of RL was explored at the nanoscale by the AFM during the anoxic holomictic event (Si, October 2011) and stratified winter (S2, January 2012) and spring (S3, May 2012) conditions in the oxic and anoxic water samples. Obtained results from the AFM uphold the electrochemical and HTCO measurements, indicating significant difference in the present type of OM during the holomictic, anoxic stress conditions in comparison to the samples collected during the stratification period. Differences in the OM type were discussed in line with the physical and biological processes that occurred in RL during sampling: mixing processes characterized by fast turnover of water layers and biological activity characterized by low (January 2012) and high (May 2012) primary production of diatoms and zooplankton grazing activities.

Changes in freeze-thaw occurrence, active-layer thickness and near-surface permafrost temperature in barren, desert grassland, alpine steppe and alpine meadow ecosystems indicate that alpine ecosystems are sensitive to climate variability. During this time, the average onset of spring thawing at 50-cm depth advanced by at least 16 days in all but the barren alpine settings, and the duration of thaw increased by at least 14 days for all but the desert grassland and barren ecosystems. All sites showed an increase in active-layer thickness (ALT) and near-surface permafrost temperature: the average increase of ALT was similar to 4.26 cm/a and the average increase in permafrost temperatures at 6 m and 10 m depths were, respectively, similar to 0.13 degrees C and similar to 0.14 degrees C. No apparent trend in mean annual air temperature was detected at the Beiluhe weather station. However, an increasing trend in precipitation was measured. This suggests that the primary control on the ALT increase was an increase in summer rainfall and the primary control on increasing permafrost temperature was probably the combined effects of increasing rainfall and the asymmetrical seasonal changes in subsurface soil temperatures.

Asbjorn			Contemporary divergence in early life history in grayling (Thymallus thymallus)	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Background: Following colonization of new habitats and subsequent selection, adaptation to environmental conditions might be expected to be rapid. In a mountain lake in Norway, Lesjaskogsvatnet, more than 20 distinct spawning demes of grayling have been established since the lake was colonized, some 20-25 generations ago. The demes spawn in tributaries consistently exhibiting either colder or warmer temperature conditions during spawning in spring and subsequent early development during early summer. In order to explore the degree of temperature-related divergence in early development, a multi-temperature common-garden experiment was performed on embryos from four different demes experiencing different spring temperatures. Results: Early developmental characters were measured to test if individuals from the four demes respond differently to the treatment temperatures. There was clear evidence of among-deme differences (genotype environment interactions) in larval growth and yolk-to-body-size conversion efficiency. Under the cold treatment regime, larval growth rates were highest for individuals belonging to cold streams. Individuals from warm streams had the highest yolk-consumption rate under cold conditions. As a consequence, yolk-to-body-mass conversion efficiency was highest for cold-deme individuals under cold conditions. As we observed response parallelism between individuals from demes belonging to similar thermal groups for these traits, some of the differentiation seems likely to result from local adaptation Conclusion: The observed differences in length at age during early larval development most likely have a genetic component, even though both directional and random processes are likely to have influenced evolutionary change in the demes under study.					; Barson, Nicola/M-4090-2015; Vøllestad, Leif/H-7305-2019	Vollestad, Leif Asbjorn/0000-0002-9389-7982; Haugen, Thrond Oddvar/0000-0001-6562-5317													1471-2148					DEC 13	2011	11								360	10.1186/1471-2148-11-360	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-11-360								22166134					WOS:000298890200001

Species composition and abundance (expressed as cover and, additionally, as PVI values, defined as per cent volume of water infested by plants) of vegetation patches dominated by Chara tomentosa L. were determined along with water physicochemical characteristics at nine permanent study sites monthly from spring through autumn. We hypothesised that the species composition of C tomentosa meadows is lake-specific whereas the abundant growth is the cause rather than a response to water quality of the studied lakes. C. tomentosa formed dense swards in every studied vegetation patch, irrespective of water depth, with negligible contributions of vascular plants to species richness and abundance. Although 15 macrophyte species were identified in the studied meadows, including eight charophytes, C tomentosa dominated throughout the growing season. Heterogeneity observed in the species composition and cover was site-specific rather than related to physicochemical differences among the lakes. PVI values were positively correlated with water temperature and pH, and negatively correlated with water conductivity, hardness and Ca2+ concentrations. The results indicate a preference for high water clarity by most charophyte species found in the studied patches and highlight the possible influence of charophyte meadows on water quality, primarily on solute content, hardness and, thereby, as a positive feedback, on water clarity.

Implications of seasonal mixing for phytoplankton production and bloom development	THEORETICAL ECOLOGY												Based on a 1D model considering phytoplankton and nutrients in a vertical water column, we investigate the consequences of temporal and spatial variations in turbulent mixing for phytoplankton production and biomass. We show that in seasonally mixed systems, the processes controlling phytoplankton production and the sensitivity of phytoplankton abundance to ambient light, trophic state and mixed-layer depth differ substantially from those at steady state in systems with time-constant diffusivities. In seasonally mixed systems, the annually replenished nutrient pool in the euphotic zone is an important factor for phytoplankton production supporting bloom development, whereas without winter mixing, production mainly depends on the diffusive nutrient flux during stratified conditions. Seasonal changes in water column production are predominantly determined by seasonal changes in phytoplankton abundance, but also by seasonal changes in specific production resulting from the transport of nutrients, the exploitation of the nutrient pool and the increase in light shading associated with phytoplankton growth. The interplay between seasonal mixing and the vertical distribution of mixing intensities is a key factor determining the relative importance of the processes controlling phytoplankton production and the sensitivity of the size and timing of the annual maximum phytoplankton abundance to the abiotic conditions.

A 36,000-yr vegetation history from the Peloncillo Mountains, southeastern Arizona, USA	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												A 36,200 cal yr B.P. vegetation history was developed from macrofossils and pollen from 55 packrat middens from 1287 to 1442 m elevation in the Peloncillo Mountains of southeasternmost Arizona, USA. Today, these elevations are dominated by semidesert grassland with a mixture of Chihuahuan and Sonoran Desert shrubs, including an eastern disjunct population of jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis). From 36,200 to 15,410 cal yr B.P., rocky areas just above large, pluvial lakes that occupied what are now dry playas supported Pinus edulis, Juniperus osteosperma, Juniperus cf coahuilensis, Quercus cf. turbinella and a rich understory of summer-flowering C-4 annuals and grasses, indicating abundant summer rains and mild winters. After similar to 15,410 cal yr B.P., P edulis declined in abundance and disappeared briefly at 13,925 call yr B.P., coincident with expansion of more xeric species and paleohydrological evidence for regional aridity during the Bolling-Allerod warm interval. P. edulis rebounded briefly during the Younger Dryas at 12,405 cal yr B.P. before disappearing along with other mesic woodland species sometime after 12, 100 cal yr B.P. The few middens dating from the early to middle Holocene (10,000-4000 yr B.P.) indicate wetter conditions than today at 7790 cal yr B.P. followed by a general drying trend. The 35 middens from the late Holocene detail the sequential arrival of desertscrub species as vegetation became more modem in character. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The lake water and most of the downstream springs have a high concentration of MgHCO3. Although, the downstream springs that issue in the Kailakhan area southwest of the lake are dominated more by MgSO4, delta(18)O data confirmed the interconnection between the lake and the springs. The springs in the Balia ravine located south of the lake are also dominated by MgHCO3. However, the springs located in the area to the west of the lake are not hydrologically connected to the lake, as deduced from the stable isotope data. Based on the vertical profiles of the water chemistry and isotopic composition of the lake, we hypothesize that the leakage from the lake takes place from the epilimnion zone. The study highlights the usefulness of stable isotope data combined with water chemistry in identifying recharge sources.																			0144-7815		1-901502-01-5				1999		258					215	219																WOS:000085488000026

The aim of the current research was to define variables on both spatial and seasonal internal phosphorus loading from bottom sediments at five stations located in zones varying in depth, oxygenation, macrophyte presence, and uses of the neighboring catchment area. Ex situ experiments done with the use of intact bottom sediment cores have shown that the highest phosphorus release occurred in the deepest part of the lake and reached 3.6 mg P/m(2) d under anoxic conditions during summer thermal stratification. In turn, the internal loading from littoral sediments, which were well aerated all year round, was clearly lower. Furthermore, phosphorus accumulation in the bottom sediment was observed to reach a maximum of 1.45 mg P/m(2) d in autumn. A comparison of the internal loading intensity in lake zones with different land uses of the neighboring catchment area has shown slightly higher values at stations adjacent to the forest catchment area than those used for recreation. Changes in the land use of the catchment area of Strzeszynskie Lake, especially the increase in impermeable surfaces, have led to an increased inflow of external loads after heavy rains, resulting in deterioration in water quality and a delayed increase in internal loading.

The results indicate that (1) most of the nitrate transport occurs early in the snowmelt season or during large winter rainstorms; (2) dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations peak early in the runoff season, decline during snowmelt, and in some streams peak again during the summer low-flow period; (3) organic nitrogen accounts for over 90% of the total nitrogen load in basin streams; (4) averaged over 10 years and the area of 10 watersheds, the nitrogen fluw rates in kg ha(-1) yr(-1) are 0.081 for nitrate-N, 0.017 For ammonium-N, 0.58 for dissolved organic N, and 0.47 for particulate organic N; (5) the variation in annual runoff explains most of the interannual and interwatershed variability in total nitrogen load; and (6) the dominance of organic nitrogen relative to nitrate-nitrogen in Tahoe basin streams contrasts with sites in eastern North America.																			0043-1397					FEB	2001	37	2					405	415		10.1029/2000WR900219	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2000WR900219													WOS:000166582800020

To investigate the contribution of changes in catchment export to long-term declines in lake TP, we examined temporal and spatial patterns in TP concentrations and export (1980-1981 to 2001-2002) across 11 subcatchments that drain into three lakes in which average ice-free TP levels have declined by approximately 35%. Annual stream export of TP decreased significantly by 30%-89% in eight of the I I subcatchments, and decreases in export were driven by declines in TP concentration, not changes in stream flow. Annual average TP concentrations varied fivefold among adjacent subcatchments, and temporal patterns in annual average TP concentrations were poorly correlated. Seasonal patterns of TP concentration were most similar among streams in the spring (March-April-May), and TP export in the spring declined significantly in 10 of the 11 subcatchments. Because spring melt is the principal hydrologic event in these seasonally snow-covered basins, decreases in TP export during the spring were primarily responsible for declines observed in annual export. The drivers of changes in TP over time are unclear at this point but are the focus of current research.

J	Pittenger, JS; Springer, CL				Pittenger, JS; Springer, CL			Native range and conservation of the white sands pupfish (Cyprinodon tularosa)	SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST												The native range of White Sands pupfish (Cyprinodon tularosa) included aquatic habitats within the basin of Pleistocene Lake Otero, which reached a maximum stand of at least 1,250 m, and perennial streams in the lake basin. Ten natural aquatic habitats were found within this native range; three (Salt Creek, Malpais Spring, and Lost River) were occupied by White Sands pupfish. Mound Spring held the only other extant population of White Sands pupfish and was not within the native range. We concluded that only the Salt Creek and Malpais Spring populations were native, based on historic habitat conditions and information on occurrence of pupfish obtained from literature, survey notes, archives, collection records, and interviews. Pupfish were introduced into Mound Spring sometime between 1967, when the spring was excavated, and 1973. We were unable to determine the source population for this stocking. A founding population of ca. 30 pupfish, most likely from Salt Creek, was introduced into Lost River in 1970. Based on our findings, current plans to establish additional populations of White Sands pupfish, with the Mound Spring population as the first priority, should be revised. The Malpais Spring should be considered for replication at a suitable site within the native range of the species.																			0038-4909					JUN	1999	44	2					157	165																WOS:000080982900004

With the exception of Ra, the concentrations of alkaline earth elements were always quite uniformly distributed throughout the water column and did not show seasonal variations. Our results indicate removal of Ra from the water column in winter, probably due to scavenging effects during the turnover period of the lake. Furthermore, during the lake stagnation in summer, the concentrations of Ra (and to a lesser extent of Ba) increased in the bottom layer of the water column. We postulate that the increase in the concentrations of these elements during stagnation results from their release from the sediments together with Mn when the sediments and the interstitial water become more anoxic. Ra and Ba were found to be enriched in the interstitial water of the sediments. Their concentrations in solid sediments decreased with increasing sediment depth and showed a sediment distribution pattern resembling that of manganese.																			0011-1643					MAY	1998	71	2					391	404																WOS:000074204000013
J	Enzel, Y; Kushnir, Y; Quade, J				Enzel, Yehouda; Kushnir, Yochanan; Quade, Jay			The middle Holocene climatic records from Arabia: Reassessing lacustrine environments, shift of ITCZ in Arabian Sea, and impacts of the southwest Indian and African monsoons	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												A dramatic increase in regional summer rainfall amount has been proposed for the Arabian Peninsula during the middle Holocene (ca. 9-5 ka BP) based on lacustrine sediments, inferred lake levels, speleothems, and pollen. This rainfall increase is considered primarily the result of an intensified Indian summer monsoon as part of the insolation-driven, northward shift of the boreal summer position of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) to over the deserts of North Africa, Arabia, and northwest India. We examine the basis for the proposed drastic climate change in Arabia and the shifts in the summer monsoon rains, by reviewing paleohydrologic lacustrine records from Arabia. We evaluate and reinterpret individual lake-basin status regarding their lacustrine-like deposits, physiography, shorelines, fauna and flora, and conclude that these basins were not occupied by lakes, but by shallow marsh environments. Rainfall increase required to support such restricted wetlands is much smaller than needed to form and maintain highly evaporating lakes and we suggest that rainfall changes occurred primarily at the elevated edges of southwestern, southern, and southeastern Arabian Peninsula. These relatively small changes in rainfall amounts and local are also supported by pollen and speleothems from the region. The changes do not require a northward shift of the Northern Hemisphere summer ITCZ and intensification of the Indian monsoon rainfall. We propose that (a) latitudinal and slight inland expansion of the North African summer monsoon rains across the Red Sea, and (b) uplifted moist air of this monsoon to southwestern Arabia highlands, rather than rains associated with intensification of Indian summer monsoon, as proposed before, increased rains in that region; these African monsoon rains produced the modest paleo-wetlands in downstream hyperarid basins. Furthermore, we postulate that as in present-day, the ITCZ in the Indian Ocean remained at or near the equator all year round, and the Indian summer monsoon, through dynamically induced air subsidence, can reduce rather than enhance summer rainfall in the Levant and neighboring deserts, including Arabia. Our summary suggests a widening to the north of the latitudinal range of the rainfall associated with the North African summer monsoon moisture crossing the Red Sea to the east. We discuss other mechanisms that could have potentially contributed to the formation and maintaining of the modest paleo-wetlands. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

CH4 produced through anaerobic decomposition of organic matter (OM) in lake sediment and water column can be either oxidized to carbon dioxide (CO2) by methanotrophic microbes or emitted to the atmosphere. While the role of CH4 oxidation as a CH4 sink is widely accepted, neither the magnitude nor the drivers behind CH4 oxidation are well constrained. In this study, we aimed to gain more specific insight into CH4 oxidation in the water column of a seasonally stratified, typical boreal lake, particularly under hypoxic conditions. We used (CH4)-C-13 incubations to determine the active CH4 oxidation sites and the potential CH4 oxidation rates in the water column, and we measured environmental variables that could explain CH4 oxidation in the water column. During hypolimnetic hypoxia, 91% of available CH4 was oxidized in the active CH4 oxidation zone, where the potential CH4 oxidation rates gradually increased from the oxycline to the hypolimnion. Our results showed that in warm springs, which become more frequent, early thermal stratification with cold well-oxygenated hypolimnion delays the period of hypolimnetic hypoxia and limits CH4 production. Thus, the delayed development of hypolimnetic hypoxia may partially counteract the expected increase in the lacustrine CH4 emissions caused by the increasing organic carbon load from forested catchments.					; Pumpanen, Jukka/B-1254-2012; Aalto, Sanni/AAY-5338-2021; Vesala, Timo/C-3795-2017; Saarela, Taija/LXA-6288-2024	Tiirola, Marja/0000-0001-5589-3748; Rissanen, Antti Juhani/0000-0002-5678-3361; Saarela, Taija/0000-0002-4618-1228; Aalto, Sanni L/0000-0002-6724-2632; Jantti, Helena/0000-0002-6400-9114; 													1015-1621	1420-9055				APR	2020	82	2							19	10.1007/s00027-019-0690-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-019-0690-8								32362734					WOS:000511603500001
J	BISHARA, NF				BISHARA, NF			CONTRIBUTIONS TO BIOLOGY OF PENAEID PRAWNS IN LAKE MANZALAH, EGYPT .1. GROWTH STUDIES AND LENGTH-WEIGHT RELATIONSHIP	AQUACULTURE												Some aspects of the biometrics of Metapenaeus stebbingi, M. monoceros and Penaeus trisulcatus in the brackishwater Lake Manzalah are studied. M. stebbingi dominated the catch all over the lake from Dec. 1966-June 1967 followed by M. monoceros. The lowest percentage was that of P. trisulcatus which dominated the catch in the northeastern and western parts of the lake from Sept.-Dec. M. monoceros dominated the catch in the northwestern area in the same period. The relation of this distribution to the nature of the lake bottom, chemical composition of the sediment and salinity variations are discussed. Age and growth studies showed that P. trisulcatus has an average monthly growth of 10 mm, and that the fishery is supported by the 0 yr class. For M. monoceros an approximate growth of 5 mm/mo. was observed and the 2 yr age group supported the fishery of this species. For M. stebbingi an approximate growth rate of 2-4 mm/mo was observed and the I+ and II+ age groups constitute the catch. The growth studies show that P. trisulcatus and M. monoceros spawn during spring, while the peak of the spawning season for M. stebbingi is in autumn. A close relationship was found between the seasonal variations in the rate of increase of prawn weight and the spawning season. The distribution of the different species and length groups in the different parts of the lake were also studied.																			0044-8486	1873-5622					1976	8	4					337	349		10.1016/0044-8486(76)90116-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0044-8486(76)90116-2													WOS:A1976CD59600005
J	Moon, JA; Haukos, DA				Moon, Jena A.; Haukos, David A.			Survival of female northern pintails wintering in the Playa Lakes Region of northwestern Texas	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The continental population of northern pintails (Anas acuta; hereafter pintails) has declined since the late 1970s, possibly due to poor breeding propensity, low nest success, and low survival rates in response to habitat loss. Survival estimates are unavailable for several winter and migration areas including the Playa Lakes Region (PLR) of northwestern Texas, USA. We investigated winter survival rates, documented periods of mortality, and identified possible causes of mortality for 159 and 168 radiotagged female pintails during 23 October 2002-18 February 2003 and 10 October 2003-18 February 2004, respectively. We located all radiotagged pintails at least once weekly to verity survival status and used-known fate modeling in program MARK to test the influence of capture period, female age class, body mass, and capture location on survival rates. Cumulative survival for the 119-day period in 2002-2003 was 0.925 (95% Cl = 86.0-96.3). During 2003-2004, for a 134-day period, survival estimates declined to 0.694 (95% Cl = 57.1-79.5). The period of highest mortality occurred during the pintail hunting season with 88% of deaths during 2002-2003 and 34% of deaths during 2003-2004 occurring during this period. Age class and capture period did not affect survival rates either year. There was a positive linear correlation between body mass at time of capture and survival rates during winter for 2003-2004. The lower survival during 2003-2004 was probably due to fewer wetlands being available in the PLR. Our results suggest that habitat conditions and hunting disturbance impact survival of pintails in the PLR of Texas. To maintain or increase wintering pintail survival in the PLR, management should expand wetland availability to wintering waterfowl, enhance food resources, provide refuging areas, and initiate a means for perpetual conservation of playas.																			0022-541X					JUN	2006	70	3					777	783		10.2193/0022-541X(2006)70[777:SOFNPW]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/0022-541X(2006)70[777:SOFNPW]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000239180800017

The distributions of 11 diatom species across the thermal bar were significantly different, reflecting their different ecological requirements. Maximum concentrations of Asterionella formosa, Nitzschia acicularis, Aulacoseira islandica occur near the shore. The distribution of Stephanodiscus hantzschii, a species characteristic of the Selenga River, suggests that riverine waters penetrate far into the lake along its eastern shore. Another species typical of the Selenga River, Stephanodiscus minutulus, was found both near the shore, and in the surface waters of the open lake. Endemic spring baikalian diatoms Aulacoseira baicalensis and Cyclotella baicalensis were found at highest concentrations in the deep waters far off-shore, beyond the thermal bar.

We have quantified the processes, both redox and exchange, that contributed to the alkalinity increases measured in two lakes that are situated on the Precambrian Shield of Ontario, Canada by measuring hypolimnetic mass balances for all substances involved in alkalinity-generating or -consuming reactions. These include nitrate, ammonium base cations, iron, manganese, sulphate, organic anions, as well as alkalinity itself. In one lake, iron reduction was the dominant source of alkalinity, since this process is probably reversed at fall overturn when hypolimnetic waters mix with oxygenated surface waters, the alkalinity generated by this mechanism is likely temporary in nature. In the second lake, iron reduction and sulphate reduction were both important; the latter should provide more permanent alkalinity.

J	Kopacka, M; Zemek, R				Kopacka, Michal; Zemek, Rostislav			Spatial variability in the level of infestation of the leaves of horse chestnut by the horse chestnut leaf miner, Cameraria ohridella (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) and in the number of adult moths and parasitoids emerging from leaf litter in an urban environment	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY												The horse chestnut leaf miner Cameraria ohridella Deschka & Dimic (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) was first recorded in Europe near lake Ohrid in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in 1985 since when it has spread throughout the whole of Europe. The reasons for its spread are well documented. The aim of this study was to assess the population density of the first generation of C. ohridella at eight sites in the urban area of Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic in two consecutive years. The density was estimated visually in terms of the damage done to horse chestnut leaves by C. ohridella larvae at each site during the vegetative season. The results revealed high variability in the mean percentage of the leaf area damaged ranging from 1.43% to 31.00% and from 0.26% to 23.40% in 2012 and 2013, respectively. The effect of site, year and interaction between these two factors were statistically highly significant. Spatial analysis revealed no autocorrelation in damage among sites indicating that the distribution of C. ohridella is random and not affected by the level of infestation at neighbouring sites. In autumn, samples of leaves were collected and the mortality of diapausing pupae of C. ohridella determined. It ranged from 12.50% to 25.82% and from 10.31% to 22.35% in 2012 and 2013, respectively. There was no significant effect of site and year and their interaction on pupal mortality. The leaf samples were then weighed and put into photo-eclectors, which were placed outdoors. Numbers of adults of C. ohridella and hymenopteran parasitoids that emerged in spring were recorded daily. There were statistically significant associations of the total number of adults that emerged from samples in spring with both site and year as well as their interaction. The number of moths that emerged was positively correlated with the damage done by the first generation of C. ohridella the previous year. Similarly, the total number of parasitoids that emerged was correlated with the number of moths that emerged. The implications of these findings for the optimization of C. ohridella control are discussed.

We investigated a populated catchment that drains into Lake Malaren, which is the drinking water source for around 2 million people including the inhabitants of Stockholm, Sweden. To assess the persistence, mobility, bioavailability and bioaccumulation of 32 structurally diverse emerging organic contaminants, sediment, integrated passive and grab water samples were collected along the catchment of the River Fyris, Sweden. The samples were complemented with STP effluent and fish samples from one sampling event. Contaminants identified as persistent, mobile, and bioavailable were 4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethyl-1,3,4,7-tetrahydrocyclopenta[g] isochromene (galaxolide), 2,4,7,9-tetramethyl-5-decyn-4,7-diol, tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate, tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate, and tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate. Galaxolide and 2,4,7,9-tetramethyl-5-decyn-4,7-diol were additionally found to be bioaccumulative, whereas n-butylbenzenesulfonamide was found to be only persistent and mobile. The total median mass flux of the persistent and mobile target analytes from Lake Ekoln into the drinking water source area of Lake Malaren was estimated to be 27 kg per year. Additionally, 10 contaminants were tentatively identified by non-target screening using NIST library searches and manual review. Two of those were confirmed by reference standards and further two contaminants, propylene glycol and rose acetate, were discharged from STPs and travelled far from the source. Attenuation of mass fluxes was highest in the summer and autumn seasons, suggesting the importance of biological degradation and photodegradation for the persistence of the studied compounds.

Here, we examine the role of seasonality in moderating interactions between a globally important invasive mysid shrimp (Hemimysis anomala) and an ecologically similar native species (Mysis salemaai) by combining distribution and diet surveys with experimental quantification of comparative resource exploitation rates and mutual aggressive interactions. We found partial overlap in winter, but not summer horizontal distributions of the two species. Diets were highly similar in the seasonally overlapping range, potentially resulting in competition for the high-quality, but seasonally scarce, zooplankton prey in invaded lakes. Despite its smaller size, H. anomala had similar feeding rates to M. salemaai on three key zooplankton prey species. H. anomala was more aggressive toward M. salemaai than M. salemaai was toward H. anomala, although there was no evidence for intraguild predation. Our findings indicate that spatio-temporal niche partitioning permitted invasion by H. anomala and coexistence with M. salemaai, in spite of their high trophic similarity.

A within-lake occupancy model for starry stonewort, Nitellopsis obtusa, to support early detection and monitoring	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												To efficiently detect aquatic invasive species early in an invasion when control may still be possible, predictions about which locations are likeliest to be occupied are needed at fine scales but are rarely available. Occupancy modeling could provide such predictions given data of sufficient quality and quantity. We assembled a data set for the macroalga starry stonewort (Nitellopsis obtusa) across Minnesota and Wisconsin, USA, where it is a new and high-priority invader. We used these data to construct a multi-season, single-species spatial occupancy model that included biotic, abiotic, and movement-related predictors. Distance to the nearest access was an important occurrence predictor, highlighting the likely role boats play in spreading starry stonewort. Fetch and water depth also predicted occupancy. We estimated an average detection probability of 63% at sites with mean non-N. obtusa plant cover, declining to similar to 38% at sites with abundant plant cover, especially that of other Characeae. We recommend that surveyors preferentially search for starry stonewort in areas of shallow depth and high fetch close to boat accesses. We also recommend searching during late summer/early fall when detection is likelier. This study illustrates the utility of fine-scale occupancy modeling for predicting the locations of nascent populations of difficult-to-detect species.

Their ecophysiological adaptations differ widely among cyanobacterial species. As a stratified species, P. rubescens forms a population in the metalimnion during summer months in lakes with clear water and disperses in the whole water column during the period. However, after a dry season in 2006 and 2007, a prolonged surface bloom in late winter was observed in Lake Sapanca The maximum biomass of P. rubescens reached 13.9 mg L-1 in surface water in February 2007 and microcystin concentrations varied between 0.12 and 8 mu g L-1 MC-LR equiv. in the open water throughout the year. The maximum microcystin value was measured at 79 mu g L-1 when accumulations of filaments were observed on the shoreline. As P. rubescens is a shade-adapted species, lower insolation in February together with stable water conditions and lower water temperature promoted the surface bloom. In conclusion, the presence of toxic P. rubescens throughout the year with changing depths poses severe health hazards to people and also an economic burden to the water treatment facility, since the lake is used as a drinking-water reservoir.					, merbay/AAB-9694-2020; , reyhan/AAB-8612-2020; Gürevin, Cenk/AAB-8531-2020; köker, latife/AAB-7634-2020	Gurevin, Cenk/0000-0002-5354-949X													1300-008X	1303-6106					2014	38	4					782	789		10.3906/bot-1401-26	http://dx.doi.org/10.3906/bot-1401-26													WOS:000336620000015

From the DOC load variability perspective, however, how much of the variability in DOC load occurred among different seasons, and which season was most synchronized with the interannual variability remains unknown. The weekly DOC concentration and daily discharge records from four headwater streams with long-term (1978-2018) records in the snowmelt driven basin of Harp Lake, south-central Ontario, Canada, were used to answer these issues. We also examined the contributions of variabilities in discharge and DOC concentration to the variability in DOC load. We found that the variability of DOC load in the rainfall season (autumn) instead of snowmelt season (spring) was most closely synchronized with its interannual variability, suggesting that if the DOC variability in the rainfall season stabilized, the interannual variability would be more stable. The interannual variabilities for discharge, DOC concentration and DOC load showed an insignificant decreasing trend in the monitored 41 years, and the respective contributions of the variability trend of discharge and DOC concentration to DOC load in rainfall season increased from 28.82% to 144.58% and decreased from 71.18% to -44.58% because the change trend of discharge variability was greater than that in DOC concentration. This study provides a case information in determining which factors contribute most to the variability of DOC load in the watershed, and which season may dominate its variability throughout the year.

Simple calculations to model the composition of Pyramid Lake waters using conservative components (B, Br, Cl, K, Na, SO4, SO4-delta S-34), mixing between Truckee River and hot spring water (PYR1) compositions, and subsequent evaporation produce a consistent set of Truckee River water: hot spring water (PYR1) mixing ratios and amount of evaporative concentration. These calculations imply a hot spring discharge rate of between 240 and 760 1/sec into the lake, which represents a high discharge rate, but feasible in light of known current and historical hot spring activity in the area. These results confirm the promising nature of the region as a geothermal exploration target area, and suggest that the composition of the lake waters can largely be explained by mixing of Truckee River water and hot spring waters, together with simple evaporation.																					978-0-415-45136-9				2007							245	249																WOS:000252215500049

This study describes the water quality of the upper stretch of the Jhelum River located in Kashmir Himalaya using multivariate statistical techniques. The descriptive statistics and correlation matrix were applied to explore the correlations between the determined water quality variables whereas; principal component/or factor analysis (PCA/FA) was employed to take out the important factors that control the seasonal water quality variations. The hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was employed for the extraction of monitoring stations that can be developed for continuous water quality assessment in this area. Based on the PCA/FA, 95.7% of the total variance in the summer season was described by six factors while 85.8% of the total variance, in the winter season, was described by only four factors. HCA based on two seasons and different levels of pollution grouped the sampling stations into 3 classes described as low-, medium-, and high-pollution regions. Overall, the results illustrated that river water quality has deteriorated progressively from upstream to downstream areas and the methodology adopted can be used for the subsequent water quality surveys to highlight any temporal evolution of river water quality.

Lake Lind varved red clay is not part of glacial Lake Grantsburg, as suggested by earlier authors, because the red varves are separated from overlying glacial Lake Grantsburg silt and clay by a unit of deltaic and fluvial sand. Furthermore, varve correlations indicate that the base of the red varves is younger to the north, showing that the basin expanded as the Superior lobe retreated and was not a lake basin dammed to the southwest by the advancing Grantsburg sublobe. Varve correlations indicate that the Superior lobe retreated at a rate of about 200 m/yr. Uniform winter-clay thickness throughout most of the varve couplets suggests thermal stratification in the lake with clay trapped in the epilimnion; some clay would exit the lake at the outlet prior to winter freeze. Zones of thicker winter-clay layers, in places associated with mud-flow layers, indicate outlet incision, lake-level fall, and shoreline erosion and resuspension of lake clay. The most likely outlet for glacial Lake Lind was in the southwest part of the lake near the present site of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Nearshore sediment indicates that the lake level of glacial Lake Lind was around 280 m. The elevation of the base of the Lake Lind sediments indicates water depth was 20 to 55 m, Evidence in the southern part of the lake basin suggests that the Superior lobe readvanced at least once during the early stages of glacial Lake Lind, Lake Lind ended not by drainage but by being filled in by prograding deltas and outwash plains composed of sand derived from the retreating Superior lobe, It was upon this fluvial surface that the Grantsburg sublobe advanced, depositing till and forming glacial Lake Grantsburg.

J	Zhang, XS; Xu, XY; Su, L; Shen, ZW				Zhang, Xiaosen; Xu, Xinyu; Su, Ling; Shen, Zhongwei			Ecological responses of the diatom species Asterionella formosa to climate change and resource availability in a shallow eutrophic lake of Chinese Loess Plateau	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Diatoms have long been recognized as strong ecological indicators for climate and environmental chang-es. Asterionella formosa Hassall is a cosmopolitan diatom species around the world, but its ecological preferences are still unclear and its palaeolimnological interpretations are strongly disputed. This species is often considered to be driven by nutrient enrichment, whereas it was recently proposed that the increasing abundance of this species is linked to warming-induced lake thermal stratification. To improve its ecological interpretation, we examine the possible driving factors of this species through diatom seasonal monitoring in an alpine, shallow and eutrophic lake (Lake Mayinghai) on the Chinese Loess Plateau. Our data show that the compositional dominance of A. formosa in the late-autumn and winter months indicates that this species can tolerate both mixing and ice-covered stable water conditions and further suggests that it has a preference to low light availability. The dominance of this species is not associated with an increase in nutrients, and does not support that this species can be used as an indicator of nutrient enrichment. However, given low diatom production in the cold season, increased lake thermal stability in the growing season induced by warming is a more probable explanation, and it is likely that a eutrophic, turbid condition or an oligotrophic, other algae-dominant low-light condition may be a requisite for its interpretation as a signal of warming.

The role of earthquakes and climate in the formation of diamictic sediments in a New Zealand mountain lake	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												We used Itrax XRF, magnetic susceptibility, grain size, and micro-CT scanning to provide a facies classification for a Late Holocene sediment sequence from Lake Chappa'ai in the Southern Alps, New Zealand. The record contained multiple diamictic layers and our objective was to determine the environmental significance of these deposits. Clast fabric analysis indicated that the diamicts comprise dropstones transported to the centre of the lake by ice rafting. Diamicts belonging to Facies 1 represent rock falls onto lake ice triggered by earthquakes that produced MMI (Modified Mercalli Intensity) > 8 shaking in the catchment. MMI > 8 earthquakes may need to occur when the lake has ice cover to produce Facies 1 diamicts. MMI > 8 earthquakes in the ice free season or MMI 7-8 earthquakes may also result in an increased flux of large (> 1 mm) clasts to the centre of the lake, but may not produce a Facies 1 diamict. More work is required to establish the role of climate related processes on the formation of non-Facies 1 diamicts in Lake Chappa'ai. Climate change may directly lead to diamict formation by changing lake ice cover and facilitating transport of large clasts by anchor ice, or increasing the likelihood of rain on snow events in the spring. Changing ice cover conditions will also affect how mountain lakes record past earthquake events. Lakes that are ice free will not produce earthquake diamicts and lakes that have perennial ice cover may produce a single diamict representing multiple earthquakes if the lake becomes ice free. A reduction in the duration of winter ice cover will also decrease the probability of capturing primary rockfall deposits from earthquakes. Additional data, such as a diatom or chironomid record from Lake Chappa'ai may help to resolve the contribution of climate processes to diamict formation. We should consider the Lake Chappa'ai record as an indicator of minimum earthquake activity until we can disentangle the effects of climate change on non-Facies 1 diamict formation. This study highlights the multiple mechanisms that can lead to diamict formation in mountain lake sediments. These processes should always be considered before attributing the presence of diamict deposits to ice-rafted debris in a pro-glacial lake. This is particularly true in seismically active settings where earthquake triggered rockfalls may lead to diamict formation. Crown Copyright (c) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	VERMAAT, JE; DEBRUYNE, RJ				VERMAAT, JE; DEBRUYNE, RJ			FACTORS LIMITING THE DISTRIBUTION OF SUBMERGED WATERPLANTS IN THE LOWLAND RIVER VECHT (THE NETHERLANDS)	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The significance of light climate and water movement for the absence of submerged vegetation in the largest part of the River Vecht was investigated at three stations along the river during the summer of 1991. 2. The underwater light climate was found to be quite adverse for the development of waterplants due to turbidity and periphyton development. Attenuation coefficients of the water were found to be high: on average 2.6, 2.8 and 3.0 m-1 for the southern, central and northern stations, respectively. In spring most of the light attenuation (90-100%) was due to the water layer; in summer periphyton and water were equally important. The light climate limited the potential occurrence of submerged macrophytes to a zone shallower than 1 m. The observed distribution of the waterplants along the river's length, however, could not be explained by the light climate alone. Presence of submerged vegetation is restricted to the southern section of the river where there is relatively little boat traffic. 3. Wave action caused by the (mainly recreational) boat traffic was observed to negatively affect plant growth in an in situ experiment with a breakwater. This points to physical damage by wave action caused by passing boats as the main factor determining waterplant distribution. An alternative explanation is the much higher density of houseboats in the northern section. When present, houseboats effectively shade out the zone shallower than 1 m, thus preventing the development of a submerged vegetation.

Each collection was conducted by continuously sampling air during the first 2 weeks of the months of August, September, October, and November. The collected toxaphene was analyzed on a capillary equipped electron capture gas chromatograph. The average concentrations over the entire sampling period for each site were 7.0 ng/m3 in Greenville, 1.3 ng/m3 in St. Louis, and 0.29 ng/m3 for Lake Michigan (Bridgman and Beaver Island combined). The trend in relative levels of toxaphene was similar at each site. Levels were moderate in August, peaked for the September collections, returned to moderate levels in October, and declined to low levels for the November samples. Diagnostic modeling to describe possible air transport of toxaphene showed that at all receptor locations the air transport corridor for toxaphene was associated with southerly winds. The strength of this corridor increased from northern to southern measurement sites.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				NOV	1986	20	11					1109	1116		10.1021/es00153a005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00153a005													WOS:A1986E601400012

For this reason, pondages are thought to have a limited impact on the fluxes of particles and solutes transported by rivers. The Malause reservoir (South West France) is such a pondage. Fed by both the Garonne and Tarn rivers, it has a water residence time of only a few days. Incoming and outgoing fluxes of nutrients, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and phytoplankton were measured weekly over the course of 1year. Mass balance calculations showed that Malause pondage retained 24% of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) supplied by both rivers on an annual basis. SRP retention occurred mostly in spring-summer, pointing to biological uptake. In addition, the pondage was a sink for SPM and phytoplankton, retaining 39% of SPM and 14% of chlorophyll a supplied by both rivers on an annual basis. The retention efficiency appeared to be constrained by water temperature and residence time. The pondage was a source of phytoplankton during summer, when temperature and water residence time was high. The pondage was a sink for SPM when water residence time was low (<1day). Our observations highlight the need to reconsider the impact of minor hydrological discontinuities on the functioning of the river continuum. The shallow depth of the pondage and the presence of dense stands of submerged macrophytes have probably favoured the retention of nutrients and the sedimentation of particles within the pondage.

Influence of runoff and groundwater inflow in the stratification developed in the Concepcion pit lake (Iberian Pyrite Belt, Spain)	MINE WATER & INNOVATIVE THINKING					International-Mine-Water-Association Symposium on Mine Water and Innovative Thinking	SEP 05-09, 2010	Sydney, CANADA	Int Mine Water Assoc, Cape Breton Univ, Ind Res Chair Mine Water Remediat & Management, Enterprise Cape Breton Corp, Soc Expans Cap Breton, VEOLIA WATER, Solutions & Technol, amec, Stantec, cogent environm, Golder Associates, CONESTOGA ROVERS & ASSOCIATES, DHI WASY, Cape Breton Cty Econ Dev Author, asa analyt, Lhoist, ADI Ltd, ISLAND WELL DRILLERS Ltd, Cape Breton Partnership, CBCL Ltd, CAMPBELL SCI Canada Corp, SCUBA TECH, AIR CANADA				The factors that influence the stratification generation of the mining lakes are little known in the lakes developed in the Iberian Pyrite Belt. The mineral reserve of Concepcion has been exploited by open pit and underground mining; both systems are currently flooded and connected hydraulically. The Concepcion pit lake has shown a permanent chemical stratification (meromictic lake), differentiating two layers with different density: i) a thick superficial layer of approximate to 10.5 +/- 1.5 m deep, (mixolimnion), and ii) a thin bottom layer from approximate to 10.5 +/- 1.5 m to 16 m deep (monimolimnion). During the hydrologic year 2008-2009 the lake presented two chemoclines: 1) a temporary and shallow (2-4 m deep) that was developed by runoff contribution during intense episodes of rain in winter, and 2) a permanent chemocline, which rose from 12 m in winter to 9 m deep in summer, due to groundwater inflow from shafts and galleries flooded through the lake bottom, counteracting water lost by evaporation. The lake bottom chemistry (the deepest point) is similar to groundwater that floods the shafts. The level variation of the lake (1.05 m) has always been lower at the level variation of permanent chemocline (3 m). This study presents the processes that are involved in the stratification and chemistry of this pit lake, which is meeting place for runoff water and groundwater that floods shafts and galleries of the underground mine.					santofimia, esther/ABG-5263-2020; Pamo, Enrique/ABG-9618-2020	Santofimia, Esther/0000-0003-4236-6812															978-1-897009-47-5				2010							507	510																WOS:000323234800118

Variable normal-fault rupture behavior, northern Lost River fault zone, Idaho, USA	GEOSPHERE												The 1983 Mw 6.9 Borah Peak earthquake generated similar to 36 km of surface rupture along the Thousand Springs and Warm Springs sections of the Lost River fault zone (LRFZ, Idaho, USA). Although the rupture is a well-studied example of multisegment surface faulting, ambiguity remains regarding the degree to which a bedrock ridge and branch fault at the Willow Creek Hills influenced rupture progress. To explore the 1983 rupture in the context of the structural complexity, we reconstruct the spatial distribution of surface displacements for the northern 16 km of the 1983 rupture and prehistoric ruptures in the same reach of the LRFZ using 252 vertical-separation measurements made from high-resolution (5-10-cm-pixel) digital surface models. Our results suggest the 1983 Warm Springs rupture had an average vertical displacement of similar to 0.3-0.4 m and released similar to 6% of the seismic moment estimated for the Borah Peak earthquake and <12% of the moment accumulated on the Warm Springs section since its last prehistoric earthquake. The 1983 Warm Springs rupture is best described as the moderate-displacement continuation of primary rupture from the Thousand Springs section into and through a zone of structural complexity. Historical and prehistoric displacements show that the Willow Creek Hills have impeded some, but not all ruptures. We speculate that rupture termination or penetration is controlled by the history of LRFZ moment release, displacement, and rupture direction. Our results inform the interpretation of paleoseismic data from near zones of normal-fault structural complexity and demonstrate that these zones may modulate rather than impede rupture displacement.					; Gold, Ryan/I-3287-2012; Briggs, Richard/A-1348-2013	Reitman, Nadine/0000-0002-6730-2682; Toke, Nathan/0000-0002-7774-322X													1553-040X					DEC	2019	15	6					1869	1892		10.1130/GES02096.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/GES02096.1													WOS:000499241600008

The 'Episode Project' in northern Sweden found a consistent relationship between the SO42- concentration of snow and the anthropogenic component of acid neutralization capacity (ANC) decline during spring flood. This correlation creates the possibility for a regional prediction of the severity of SO42- anthropogenic episodic acidification during spring flood episodes using deposition data together with chemical data from 1240 lakes selected to be representative of northern Sweden. The regional assessment found that in 1998, ca 6% of the region was seriously affected by anthropogenic acidification during spring flood. The results from this study have important implications for both the national liming strategy and international negotiations to further reduce emissions of air pollutants in Europe.

These habitats are of crucial importance for the reproduction of the birds, as well as for their massive migratory concentrations on the East Asian-Australian migration route in the summer-autumn period. A description of the natural conditions of these territories is provided and the most valuable biotopes are identified, including drying zones rich in marine invertebrates, waterlogged coastal grass fields and moss bogs with karst lakes. Especially significant clusters of birds are formed in the large sea bays - Shchastya, Nikolaya, Ulbanskii, Konstantin, Tugurskii Bays, Udskaya guba, on the Mukhtel Lake, and in the Amur liman The state of these territories is currently considered as satisfactory, but nonetheless there are certain threats for the ornithologic fauna and bird population. We propose measures for the conservation of birds at the "Okhotsk section" of the East Asian-Australian migration route. We also suggest to organize wetlands of regional significance "Nikolaya, Ulbanskii and Konstantin Bays" in Tuguro-Chumikanskii district and the natural park "Shchastya Bay" in Nikolaevskii district of Khabarovsk Krai.					; Kryukova, Maria/AAQ-7762-2020; Makhinov, Aleksei/HKW-5824-2023	Makhinov, Aleksei/0000-0002-4914-1408; 													1755-1307						2019	381								012075	10.1088/1755-1315/381/1/012075	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/381/1/012075													WOS:000521638100075

Water samples were collected every three months at the same sites to analyse 20 physico-chemical parameters. Chlorophyll a and b and carotenoids were evaluated as the food content indices in phytoplankton as a whole and separately in cells smaller than 50 mum. The study has revealed that the highest female fertility in Copepoda representatives (genus Eudiaptomus) occurs in spring, while in Cladocera individuals (genus Bosmina and Daphnia) - in summer. Generally, both in Copepoda and Cladocera representatives the number of laid eggs increases and their size decreases with the rise in lake trophic state.																			1230-1485	2083-5906					2002	11	1					23	31																WOS:000173888300004

The abundance of the helminth and the ratio between its age groups depends on water temperature, immunity of fishes, biological peculiarities of D. amphibothrium and other factors. The helminth has 2 generations/yr: an early summer generation which appears in the end of June and dies off in Aug.-Sept. and a late summer one which appears in Aug.-Sept. and dies off in May-June of the next year. The worms lay eggs in all seasons. The reproductive rate increases with rise in water temperature. Within its life a helminth of the early summer generation produces .apprx. 411 eggs and are of the late summer .apprx. 853 eggs.

However, isotope fractionation effects during denitrification lead to significant uncertainties when quantifying groundwater NO3-sources using the SIAR model. In this study, hydrochemical data, water isotopes (delta D-H2O and delta 18O-H2O), and dual nitrate isotopes of groundwater at the West Lake watershed, East China were measured to estimate the isotope fractionation effect of denitrification in groundwater and assess its impact on quantifying NO3-source contributions using the SIAR model. The significant spatial (epsilon N:-6.9 %o and epsilon O:-3.1 %o in G1; epsilon N:-15.1 %o and epsilon O:-10.0 %o in G2) and temporal (epsilon N:-17.0 %o and epsilon O:-4.1 %o in spring; epsilon N:-4.9 %o and epsilon O:-2.5 %o in summer; epsilon N:-7.2 %o and epsilon O:-6.0 %o in autumn) variations in isotope fractionation effects of denitrification in groundwater at the West Lake watershed were observed. By incorporating these respective isotope fractionation enrichment factors into the SIAR model, more accurate NO3-source apportionments for G1 and G2 were obtained, confirming that the isotope fractionation effect of denitrification is an important parameter for quantifying NO3-sources in groundwater using the SIAR model. Furthermore, the national delta 15N-NO3-and delta 18O-NO3-observations of groundwater were compiled and the SIAR model integrated with isotope fractionation effect of denitrification were used to quantify NO3-sources in groundwater of China. It was found that regional differences in human activities directly influenced spatial variations of delta 15N-NO3-and delta 18O-NO3-values. The SIAR model outputs on a national scale revealed that sewage/manure (22.9-42.1 %) and chemical fertilizers (23.0-42.7 %) were the main NO3-sources in groundwater of China, attributable to large populations and extensive agricultural cultivation areas. These results provide direct evidence for formulating suitable policies and measures to control and reduce groundwater NO3-in China.					陈, 奇芳/B-9213-2017; Li, Feili/A-1550-2012														0269-7491	1873-6424				JUN 15	2025	375								126360	10.1016/j.envpol.2025.126360	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2025.126360		MAY 2025						40320121					WOS:001487360700001

L.; McLaren, Robert			Enhanced NO2 and aerosol extinction observed in the tropospheric column behind lake-breeze fronts using MAX-DOAS	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT-X												The lake breezes that frequently occur in Southern Ontario impact the levels of pollutants experienced by the populations in urban areas. The effects of lake breeze circulations on pollution transport and processing are not well understood. Few studies have measured the circulations' impact on pollutants both at the surface and within the tropospheric column. In this study, pollutants in the tropospheric column (NO2 VCDs and AODs) were measured using MAX-DOAS concurrent with near-surface measurements of NOx, O-3, and PM2.5 on lake breeze days in Toronto in September and October. The arrival of lake-breeze fronts (LBF) was identified using co-located meteorological data. The presence of lake breezes was confirmed using mesoscale analyses of radar, satellite and a network of meteorological stations. NO2 VCDs exhibited short-term increases of 0.8-3.4.1016 molecules cm(-2) above the pre-LBF levels following the arrival of a LBF. These measurements are the first confirmation of the theorized presence of enhanced total burden of pollution within the total column behind the front within a lakebreeze circulation on multiple lake breeze days. Rapid decreases of O-3 of up to 13 ppb at the arrival of the LBF were unexpected based on observed increases in O-3 in other studies, but can be attributed to reduced photochemical O-3 production during late summer and fall compared to mid-summer. AODs exhibited delayed enhancements compared to NO2 VCDs, appearing to be driven by enhanced humidity following the front, in addition to enhanced particle concentration. Our measurements highlight the complex 3-D structure of lakebreeze circulations.					; McLaren, Robert/F-5431-2011	Davis, Zoe/0000-0003-4101-5308; 														2590-1621				JAN	2020	5								100066	10.1016/j.aeaoa.2020.100066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aeaoa.2020.100066													WOS:000530646700015

Principal components analyses of meristic and mensural data indicate three subsets among the 11 populations of G. nobilus examined: 1) the Blue Spring, New Mexico, population, 2) the Texas populations from Comanche Springs (now extinct) and three springs (Phantom Lake, Giffin, and East Sandia) in the Toyah Creek drainage near Balmorhea, and 3) the populations in the Roswell area of New Mexico and the Leon Creek drainage of Texas which are morphologically intermediate between subsets 1 and 2. These morphologically defined subsets cannot be associated with any obvious environmental feature, and they show little geographic cohesiveness. For these reasons, subspecific designations seem unwarranted.

We studied the fish community in a small subtropical spring lake, Lake Zacapu, for two different decades to analyse its structural characteristics. Sampling was performed every 3 months at four sites from January to October 1995 and from May 2019 to May 2020. We determined the temporal variation (seasonal and decadal) in the fish community structure with respect to composition, abundance, diversity and dominance. We evaluated the association between species and water quality. Our results showed spatial homogeneity in most physicochemical variables that remained in the same range across decades, although some nutrients (NO3) recently increased. All species identified in the early samples were present in the recent surveys (eleven native and two nonnative species), indicating that the fish community composition had significant qualitative stability. However, the dominant littoral cyprinid in 1995 was replaced by the more limnetic atherinopsid in 2019-2020, and the diversity and abundance of sensitive fish decreased in recent samplings. Consequently, the current status of critically endangered species is supported for some restricted and microendemic fish. The changes in the community structure attributes, which show a tendency for reduction in native species, emphasise the need to implement efforts to conserve freshwater fish diversity in small spring lakes.					; De La Cruz-Agüero, José/Q-8224-2018; De La Cruz - Aguero, Jose/Q-8224-2018; Moncayo-Estrada, Rodrigo/Q-8229-2018; López-López, Eugenia/AAI-2646-2019	Lopez-Lopez, Eugenia/0000-0003-2696-533X; De La Cruz - Aguero, Jose/0000-0002-8560-0720; Moncayo-Estrada, Rodrigo/0000-0003-0204-1482; , Omar/0000-0001-9583-4443													0906-6691	1600-0633				JAN	2023	32	1					53	63		10.1111/eff.12669	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12669		JUN 2022											WOS:000809941700001
J	Bridgeman, TB; Schloesser, DW; Krause, AE				Bridgeman, TB; Schloesser, DW; Krause, AE			Recruitment of Hexagenia mayfly nymphs in western Lake Erie linked to environmental variability	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												After a 40-year absence caused by pollution and eutrophication, burrowing mayflies (Hexagenia spp.) recolonized western Lake Erie in the mid 1990s as water quality improved. Mayflies are an important food resource for the economically valuable yellow perch fishery and are considered to be major indicator species of the ecological condition of the lake. Since their reappearance, however, mayfly populations have suffered occasional unexplained recruitment failures. In 2002, a failure of fall recruitment followed an unusually warm summer in which western Lake Erie became temporarily stratified, resulting in low dissolved oxygen levels near the lake floor. In the present study, we examined a possible link between Hexagenia recruitment and periods of intermittent stratification for the years 1997-2002. A simple model was developed using surface temperature, wind speed, and water column data from 2003 to predict stratification. The model was then used to detect episodes of stratification in past years for which water column data are unavailable. Low or undetectable mayfly recruitment occurred in 1997 and 2002, years in which there was frequent or extended stratification between June and September. Highest mayfly reproduction in 2000 corresponded to the fewest stratified periods. These results suggest that even relatively brief periods of stratification can result in loss of larval mayfly recruitment, probably through the effects of hypoxia. A trend toward increasing frequency of hot summers in the Great Lakes region could result in recurrent loss of mayfly larvae in western Lake Erie and other shallow areas in the Great Lakes.

Signals are better recorded in undeveloped groundwater basins where long-term monitoring has occurred. In northeastern California there lies 22,000 km(2) Quaternary-aged volcanic aquifer system that is largely undeveloped. Based on isotope analyses, groundwater is recharged at volcanic centers of Mt. Shasta, Medicine Lake Volcano, and Lassen Peak, which act as focal points of high elevation snowmelt infiltration that flows 20-50 km in these aquifers before emerging as similar to 85 m(3)/s of spring discharge. Groundwater residence times were measure at <30 years. During extended droughts base flow shows 20-50% decrease in volumetric discharge. Furthermore, changes in aerial groundwater storage is captured by inter-annual differences in late summer base flow and records intra- and inter-decadal climate cycling. No net long-term change in storage is observed over the past 100 years.																					978-0-7844-8061-8				2017							80	89																WOS:000404787300008

Jeffrey			Simulating the hydrologic impacts of land-cover and climate changes in a semi-arid watershed	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												Changes in climate and land cover are among the principal variables affecting watershed hydrology. This paper uses a cell-based model to examine the hydrologic impacts of climate and land-cover changes in the semi-arid Lower Virgin River (LVR) watershed located upstream of Lake Mead, Nevada, USA. The cell-based model is developed by considering direct runoff based on the Soil Conservation Service - Curve Number (SCS-CN) method and surplus runoff based on the Thornthwaite water balance theory. After calibration and validation, the model is used to predict LVR discharge under future climate and land-cover changes. The hydrologic simulation results reveal climate change as the dominant factor and land-cover change as a secondary factor in regulating future river discharge. The combined effects of climate and land-cover changes will slightly increase river discharge in summer but substantially decrease discharge in winter. This impact on water resources deserves attention in climate change adaptation planning.																			0262-6667	2150-3435				OCT 3	2015	60	10					1739	1758		10.1080/02626667.2014.948445	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2014.948445													WOS:000364559500006

Assessing the effects of sub-tropical winter thermal conditions on coolwater fish reproduction	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Fish populations on equatorward range edges are often the first to exceed thermal bounds in response to climate-induced warming, increasing risk for local extirpation. For many fishes, regionally specific thermal bounds for reproduction and early life stages are unknown as is the potential for transgenerational acclimation, limiting our ability to identify populations at the greatest risk from warming. Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens, Mitchill 1814), a coolwater species, have a patchy distribution at the southern edge of their North American range, occurring primarily in systems with summertime coolwater refugia. Minimum winter temperatures in these systems are much warmer than in northern locations where long, cold winters result in higher quality eggs compared with short, warm winters. We conducted controlled laboratory experiments with Yellow Perch from the Savannah River, SC to determine how sub-tropical minimum winter temperatures and durations affected reproduction. We measured spawning success, fecundity, egg and larval quality, and assessed the potential for transgenerational acclimation. We found that minimum winter temperature influenced timing of spawning, but had no effect on spawning success, fecundity, egg size or transgenerational acclimation. Larval size was positively associated with colder winters, but eggs from colder winters also had lower caloric density, suggesting a possible trade-off between larval size and egg energetic density. Our results provide an improved understanding of the thermal requirements for successful Yellow Perch reproduction at southern latitudes and suggest knowledge of local adaptations is required to accurately predict the impacts of warming on coolwater fishes.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				APR	2022	31	2					300	316		10.1111/eff.12631	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12631		SEP 2021											WOS:000692538600001

Presence and sources of fecal coliform bacteria in epilithic periphyton communities of lake superior	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Epilithic periphyton communities were sampled at three sites on the Minnesota shoreline of Lake Superior from June 2004 to August 2005 to determine if fecal coliforms and Escherichia coli were present throughout the ice-free season. Fecal coliform densities increased up to 4 orders of magnitude in early summer, reached peaks of up to 1.4 X 10(5) CFU cm(-2) by late July, and decreased during autumn. Horizontal, fluorophore-enhanced repetitive-PCR DNA fingerprint analyses indicated that the source for 2% to 44% of the E. coli bacteria isolated from these periphyton communities could be identified when compared with a library of E. coli fingerprints from animal hosts and sewage. Waterfowl were the major source (68 to 99%) of periphyton E. coli strains that could be identified. Several periphyton E. coli isolates were genotypically identical (>= 92% similarity), repeatedly isolated over time, and unidentified when compared to the source library, suggesting that these strains were naturalized members of periphyton communities. If the unidentified E. coli strains from periphyton were added to the known source library, then 57% to 81% of E. coli strains from overlying waters could be identified, with waterfowl (15 to 67%), periphyton (6 to 28%), and sewage effluent (8 to 28%) being the major potential sources. Inoculated E. coli rapidly colonized natural periphyton in laboratory microcosms and persisted for several weeks, and some cells were released to the overlying water. Our results indicate that E. coli from periphyton released into waterways confounds the use of this bacterium as a reliable indicator of recent fecal pollution.

With further increasing surface air temperatures, meltwater-induced hydrofracturing, basal sliding, or surface thinning will cumulate and most likely trigger unprecedented ice mass loss on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. While the Greenland surface hydrological network as well as its impacts on ice dynamics and mass balance has been studied in much detail, Antarctic supraglacial lakes remain understudied with a circum-Antarctic record of their spatio-temporal development entirely lacking. This study provides the first automated supraglacial lake extent mapping method using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery over Antarctica and complements the developed optical Sentinel-2 supraglacial lake detection algorithm presented in our companion paper. In detail, we propose the use of a modified U-Net for semantic segmentation of supraglacial lakes in single-polarized Sentinel-1 imagery. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is implemented with residual connections for optimized performance as well as an Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module for multiscale feature extraction. The algorithm is trained on 21,200 Sentinel-1 image patches and evaluated in ten spatially or temporally independent test acquisitions. In addition, George VI Ice Shelf is analyzed for intra-annual lake dynamics throughout austral summer 2019/2020 and a decision-level fused Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 maximum lake extent mapping product is presented for January 2020 revealing a more complete supraglacial lake coverage (similar to 770 km(2)) than the individual single-sensor products. Classification results confirm the reliability of the proposed workflow with an average Kappa coefficient of 0.925 and a F1-score of 93.0% for the supraglacial water class across all test regions. Furthermore, the algorithm is applied in an additional test region covering supraglacial lakes on the Greenland ice sheet which further highlights the potential for spatio-temporal transferability. Future work involves the integration of more training data as well as intra-annual analyses of supraglacial lake occurrence across the whole continent and with focus on supraglacial lake development throughout a summer melt season and into Antarctic winter.

Small and shallow lakes can have high emissions but have only recently gained more attention. We studied the quantity and spatiotemporal variability of CH4 ebullition from a small (1.4 ha) and shallow (max 1.5 m) temperate lake in Germany during 2017 and 2018. We found a high range of fluxes (0-872 mg m(-2) d(-1)) and > 90% of the fluxes were emitted between May and August. Fluxes in early spring and late autumn were below 4 mg m(-2) d(-1). Also, on a spatial scale, fluxes varied distinctly and generally increased from the shore to the center of the lake. To identify drivers of observed emissions patterns, we measured temperature and air pressure, the quantity and quality of the sedimented organic matter (OM) as well as chemical and physical properties of the sediment. Generalized linear models identified temperature, sediment porosity and organic matter content as the best predictors for the observed spatiotemporal differences, whereas temperature was accountable for the observed temporal, and porosity and organic matter content for the spatial variability. We suggest that in small lakes, temperature could serve as master variable to predict site-specific CH4 ebullition while spatial within-lake differences are determined by varying physical sediment properties more than quantity or quality of the OM.					; Knorr, Klaus-Holger/B-8321-2008	Praetzel, Leandra/0000-0003-0401-5245; Knorr, Klaus-Holger/0000-0003-4175-0214													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2021	66	7					2598	2610		10.1002/lno.11775	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11775		MAY 2021											WOS:000647412600001

To study the distribution patterns of benthic diatom traits, lakes were sampled during the summer and early autumn. Niche breadth, niche position (NP), regional occupancy and local abundances (LAs) of benthic diatom traits and their combinations were determined along different environmental gradients. Benthic diatom traits were identified in all possible niche types (14% non-marginal-narrow, 37% non-marginal-broad, 8% marginal-narrow and 41% marginal-broad niche). On the basis of increased niche differentiation, it is possible to achieve an improved and more effective utilization of the eco-morphological concept of diatom traits. The relationships between the occupancy, abundance and niche characteristics suggest that the broader the niche, the wider the distribution and the greater the LA; the more marginal the NP, the more restricted spatially the distribution and the lower the LA. With regard to the key factors driving the occupancy of benthic diatom traits in lentic ecosystems, the NP hypothesis proves to be the best predictor of its variation.

Winter soil CO2 efflux and its contribution to annual soil respiration in different ecosystems of Ebinur Lake Area	EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE												Arid and semiarid areas account for about one-third of the total land surface, and which play an important role in the global carbon cycle and climate system. However, up to now, compare with plenty knowledge information on winter soil efflux of forest ecosystems in mid-latitude ecosystems, winter soil efflux of arid areas at mid-latitude ecosystems is scare, Ebinur Lake Area, which is the study area of the present study, is located in arid regions of Northern China, with a vulnerable ecological environment suffering from extreme weather and climate. The objectives of this study were: (1) measure the winter soil respiration rate in our study area and determine its major environmental factors; (2) determine the winter soil CO2 efflux and its contribution to annual soil CO2 efflux in different ecosystems; and (3) discuss the estimated method of soil respiration that is most suitable to arid areas. We measured winter soil CO2 efflux and the associated environment factors in a farmland ecosystem (50a and 9a cotton fields), an abandoned land ecosystem (7a and 3a abandoned lands) and desert ecosystem (Populus euphratica, Phragmites australis communities and sandy desert) in Ebinur Lake Area, China. The average winter soil respiration rate in the arid areas in the mid-latitude was 0.063 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) to 0.730 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Specifically, the average winter soil respiration rate in the farmland ecosystems, abandoned land ecosystems and desert ecosystems were 0.686 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), 0.443 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 0.276 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively. Range of annual Q (10) (known as the increase in soil respiration rate per 10A degrees C increase in temperature) in the three ecosystems were 0.989 to 4.962, 1.971 to 2.096 and 0.947 to 5.173, respectively. The relatively higher Q (10) values in the different ecosystems were all obtained in winter. We found that water (in the form of soil moisture or atmospheric humidity) was the primary factor that affected the change of soil respiration rate in the winter. Winter soil CO2 efflux were 9 g C m(-2) to 132 g C m(-2) and 19 g C m(-2) to 130 g C m(-2) by the observed and modelled method for soil respiration, respectively. The average winter soil CO2 efflux were 79.4 and 78.7 g C m(-2), reLspectively. The contributions of winter soil CO2 efflux to annual one were 4% to 31% and 4% to 30%. In the study area, the model using the observed ecosystem-specific response equations between soil respiration and water-temperature simulated the soil respiration rate was the most suitable ones.

Enhancing Ensemble Seasonal Streamflow Forecasts in the Upper Colorado River Basin Using Multi-Model Climate Forecasts	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												In the Colorado River Basin (CRB), ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) forecasts drive operational planning models that project future reservoir system conditions. CRB operational seasonal streamflow forecasts are produced using ESP, which represents climate using an ensemble of meteorological sequences of historical temperature and precipitation, but do not typically leverage additional real-time subseasonal-to-seasonal climate forecasts. Any improvements to streamflow forecasts would help stakeholders who depend on operational projections for decision making. We explore incorporating climate forecasts into ESP through variations on an ESP trace weighting approach, focusing on Colorado River unregulated inflows forecasts to Lake Powell. The k-nearest neighbors (kNN) technique is employed using North American Multi-Model Ensemble one- and three-month temperature and precipitation forecasts, and preceding three-month historical streamflow, as weighting factors. The benefit of disaggregated climate forecast information is assessed through the comparison of two kNN weighting strategies; a basin-wide kNN uses the same ESP weights over the entire basin, and a disaggregated-basin kNN applies ESP weights separately to four subbasins. We find in general that climate-informed forecasts add greater marginal skill in late winter and early spring, and that more spatially granular disaggregated-basin use of climate forecasts slightly improves skill over the basin-wide method at most lead times.

The pH in Peridinium patches rises during the bloom to values higher than pH9 [2] and results in CO2 limitation. Here we show that depletion of dissolved CO2 (CO2(dis)) stimulated formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induced cell death in both natural and cultured Peridinium populations. In contrast, addition of CO2 prevented ROS formation. Catalase inhibited cell death in culture, implicating hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as the active ROS. Cell death was also blocked by a cysteine protease inhibitor, E-64, a treatment which stimulated cyst formation. Intracellular ROS accumulation induced protoplast shrinkage and DNA fragmentation prior to cell death. We propose that CO2 limitation resulted in the generation of ROS to a level that induced programmed cell death, which resembles apoptosis in animal and plant cells. Our results also indicate that cysteine protease(s) are involved in processes that determine whether a cell is destined to die or to form a cyst.

We used extant environmental DNA (eDNA) samples originally collected to delineate bull trout (Savelinus confluenius) occupancy to determine whether tailed frogs reside outside of their current known distribution in the Warm Springs Creek watershed. We were able to rapidly confirm tailed frog occupancy in these two tributaries of Warm Springs Creek watershed, and located tailed frogs throughout the mainstem of Warm Springs Creek where their presence was previously unknown. Repurposing eDNA samples provides a sensitive and extremely cost effective way to determine species distributions, because existing samples can continue to be retested for unrelated taxa without repeating field collections.

In order to examine effective release strategies for this fish independent of reed zone, a follow-up survey of otolith marked juvenile nigorobuna with ALC released into reed zones in June to July was conducted. As a result, growth of nigorobuna was as good as in the year with high water temperature from August to October. Nigorobuna extended the distribution along with the thermocline when the water temperature fell gradually toward winter, and expanded the distribution toward the bottom of the lake when the water temperature difference of the upper and lower layers of the thermocline was less than about 3.5 degrees. High survival was expected by releasing young nigorobuna of body weight ca. 20 g (standard length ca. 85 mm) to the offing during this period.

J	Lv, JL; Niu, YD; Yuan, RQ; Wang, SQ				Lv, Jiali; Niu, Yangdan; Yuan, Ruiqiang; Wang, Shiqin			Different Responses of Bacterial and Archaeal Communities in River Sediments to Water Diversion and Seasonal Changes	MICROORGANISMS												In recent years, different responses of archaea and bacteria to environmental changes have attracted increasing scientific interest. In the mid-latitude region, Fen River receives water transferred from the Yellow River, electrical conductivity (EC), concentrations of Cl- and Na+ in water, total phosphorus (TP), and Olsen phosphorus (OP) in sediments were significantly affected by water transfer. Meanwhile, temperature and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) of water showed significant seasonal variations. Based on 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing technology, the composition of bacteria and archaea in sediments was determined in winter and summer, respectively. Results showed that the dominance of bacterial core flora decreased and that of archaeal core flora increased after water diversion. The abundance and diversity of bacterial communities in river sediments were more sensitive to anthropogenic and naturally induced environmental changes than that of archaeal communities. Bacterial communities showed greater resistance than archaeal communities under long-term external disturbances, such as seasonal changes, because of rich species composition and complex community structure. Archaea were more stable than bacteria, especially under short-term drastic environmental disturbances, such as water transfer, due to their insensitivity to environmental changes. These results have important implications for understanding the responses of bacterial and archaeal communities to environmental changes in river ecosystems affected by water diversion.

Its abundance is influenced by environmental factors like food quantity and quality, predation, diseases, temperature and washout by discharge. In ultra-oligotrophic Lake Brienz (Switzerland), which is turbid from suspended glacial material, Daphnia density has continuously decreased since the 1990 s. In spring and summer 1999, during and after a severe flood, Daphnia density was below detection level, but the population recovered the following year. Simultaneously, a drastic two-year decline occurred in the yield of whitefish (Coregonus sp.), which mainly feed on Daphnia. Several hypotheses were tested to explain the collapse of the Daphnia population: a negative effect of the suspended particles, a covering of the diapausing eggs by sediment, and a combined washout/temperature effect. A direct negative effect of the particles and covering of diapausing eggs could be excluded. According to model calculations, the spring growth of the Daphnia population could not compensate the washout losses, as it was limited by poor food conditions due to re-oligotrophication and reduced by extraordinarily low water temperatures. Moreover, ephippia abundance analysed from sediment cores was consistent with the process of eutrophication and re-oligotrophication and indicated that daphnids did not persist in the lake in the period before eutrophication (until 1955). Like most peri-alpine lakes in Europe, Lake Brienz has returned to its natural ultra-oligotrophic state and is now unable to support a large Daphnia population and fishing yield.

Light-absorbing impurities in Arctic snow	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Absorption of radiation by ice is extremely weak at visible and near-ultraviolet wavelengths, so small amounts of light-absorbing impurities in snow can dominate the absorption of solar radiation at these wavelengths, reducing the albedo relative to that of pure snow, contributing to the surface energy budget and leading to earlier snowmelt. In this study Arctic snow is surveyed for its content of light-absorbing impurities, expanding and updating the 19831984 survey of Clarke and Noone. Samples were collected in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Svalbard, Norway, Russia, and the Arctic Ocean during 1998 and 2005-2009, on tundra, glaciers, ice caps, sea ice, frozen lakes, and in boreal forests. Snow was collected mostly in spring, when the entire winter snowpack is accessible for sampling. Sampling was carried out in summer on the Greenland Ice Sheet and on the Arctic Ocean, of melting glacier snow and sea ice as well as cold snow. About 1200 snow samples have been analyzed for this study. The snow is melted and filtered; the filters are analyzed in a specially designed spectrophotometer system to infer the concentration of black carbon (BC), the fraction of absorption due to non-BC light-absorbing constituents and the absorption Angstrom exponent of all particles. This is done using BC calibration standards having a mass absorption efficiency of 6.0 m(2) g(-1) at 550 nm and by making an assumption that the absorption Angstrom exponent for BC is 1.0 and for non-BC light-absorbing aerosol is 5.0. The reduction of snow albedo is primarily due to BC, but other impurities, principally brown (organic) carbon, are typically responsible for similar to 40% of the visible and ultraviolet absorption. The meltwater from selected snow samples was saved for chemical analysis to identify sources of the impurities. Median BC amounts in surface snow are as follows (nanograms of carbon per gram of snow): Greenland 3, Arctic Ocean snow 7, melting sea ice 8, Arctic Canada 8, subarctic Canada 14, Svalbard 13, Northern Norway 21, western Arctic Russia 27, northeastern Siberia 34. Concentrations are more variable in the European Arctic than in Arctic Canada or the Arctic Ocean, probably because of the proximity to BC sources. Individual samples of falling snow were collected on Svalbard, documenting the springtime decline of BC from March through May. Absorption Angstrom exponents are 1.5-1.7 in Norway, Svalbard, and western Russia, 2.1-2.3 elsewhere in the Arctic, and 2.5 in Greenland. Correspondingly, the estimated contribution to absorption by non-BC constituents in these regions is similar to 25%, 40%, and 50% respectively. It has been hypothesized that when the snow surface layer melts some of the BC is left at the top of the snowpack rather than being carried away in meltwater. This process was observed in a few locations and would cause a positive feedback on snowmelt. The BC content of the Arctic atmosphere has declined markedly since 1989, according to the continuous measurements of near-surface air at Alert (Canada), Barrow (Alaska), and Ny-Alesund (Svalbard). Correspondingly, the new BC concentrations for Arctic snow are somewhat lower than those reported by Clarke and Noone for 1983-1984, but because of methodological differences it is not clear that the differences are significant. Nevertheless, the BC content of Arctic snow appears to be no higher now than in 1984, so it is doubtful that BC in Arctic snow has contributed to the rapid decline of Arctic sea ice in recent years.

J	Xenopoulos, MA; Frost, PC; Elser, JJ				Xenopoulos, MA; Frost, PC; Elser, JJ			Joint effects of UV radiation and phosphorus supply on algal growth rate and elemental composition	ECOLOGY												Phytoplankton growth and elemental composition are influenced by a number of factors such as photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and nutrient availability. However, little is known about the influence of solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and interactions with nutrients on algal growth processes in situ. We tested the effects of solar radiation and phosphorus supply on algal growth kinetics and elemental composition in two boreal lakes (northwestern Ontario, Canada) during summer 1999. Growth bioassays (at five phosphorus concentrations) assessed changes in algal growth and elemental composition exposed to (1) ultraviolet A [UVA], ultraviolet B [UVB], and photosynthetically active radiation [PAR], (2) UVA and PAR, and (3) PAR only. Growth rates, calculated from changes in seston carbon and chlorophyll, responded strongly to both P and UVR. Results indicated that phytoplankton growth was co-regulated by P limitation and UVR suppression, with highest growth rates found in high P, low UVR treatments. Phytoplankton exposed to both UVA and UVB generally grow more slowly than those exposed to PAR only, even at high P levels. UVB and UVA reduced maximum growth rates by 8-66% and 11-21%, respectively. Phytoplankton growth was more strongly affected by UVB in spring than later in summer, possibly due to shifts in the dominant species present. Manipulations of light and P supply both significantly affected seston C:P ratios. UVR reduced sestonic C:P. Such changes in growth rates and C:P ratios from UVR exposure may have important implications for pelagic food web dynamics.

J	SCOTT, BJ				SCOTT, BJ			CYCLIC ACTIVITY IN THE CRATER LAKES OF WAIMANGU HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM, NEW-ZEALAND	GEOTHERMICS												Frying Pan and Inferno Crater lakes occupy craters formed on 10 June 1886 during the Tarawera Rift eruption. These lakes are the largest and most spectacular hot springs in New Zealand, and together they display interrelated cyclic variations about a 38 day cycle. The lake occupying Inferno Crater fluctuates from overflow to about 8 m below overflow, although exceptionally the water level has receded below 12 m, which is at least an order of magnitude larger than other known geyser like hot springs. The temperature fluctuates sympathetically with the water level in the range 35.0 to 84.5 degrees C. Four distinct stages are recognised with the following average parameters; the first lasts 7.7 days, water level and temperature rise respectively 4.7m and 17.3 degrees C, while the lake volume increases by 23 800 m(3). The second lasts 14.7 days, water level rises 3.99 m, the temperature remains steady about 60.7 degrees C, lake volume increases 22 000 m(3). The third is an overflow of 79.1 litre sec(-1) for 51.3 hours peaking at 70.6 degrees C. In the fourth stage, lake level recedes 7.9m decreasing lake volume 45 800 m(3) over 15.1 days, and the lake temperature falls 26.4 degrees C. The discharge of nearby Frying Pan Lake varies inversely with the water level of Inferno Crater Lake by 20.2 +/- 2.7 litre sec(-1) and also responds to a previously unrecognised cycle of about 20 days duration. The temperature of the discharge also responds to the 20 and 38 day cycles, but shows no correlation with discharge volume. Ambient air temperature strongly influences the discharge temperature, which ranges annually between 44.3 degrees C and 56.6 degrees C with a mean of 50.1 degrees C. A slight decrease of about 1.4 degrees C is apparent between 1972 and 1990. The mean annual discharge from Frying Pan Lake has decreased from 122.2 to 104.1 litre sec(-1) between 1972 and 1990.																			0375-6505					OCT-DEC	1994	23	5-6					555	572		10.1016/0375-6505(94)90019-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0375-6505(94)90019-1													WOS:A1994QG37600012
J	Shi, JC; Wang, G; He, Y; Wu, JJ; Xu, JM				Shi, Jiachun; Wang, Gang; He, Yan; Wu, Jianjun; Xu, Jianming			Lead accumulation in Westlake Longjing tea: non-edaphic genesis as revealed by regional scale estimate	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS					1st International Symposium of Molecular Environmental Soil Science at the Interfaces in the Earths Critical Zone	OCT 10-14, 2009	Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA	Int Union Soil Sci, Int Union Pure & Appl Chem, Prohibit Chem Weapons, Natl Nat Sci Fdn China, Soil Sci Soc China, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Subtrop Soil & Plant Nutr	Zhejiang Univ			Longjing (Dragon Well) tea from the West Lake region of Hangzhou, China, is one of the highest quality green teas prized for drinking and is often called the national drink of China. However, the ever-increasing accumulation of lead (Pb) in Westlake Longjing tea has been continually reported in the recent decades, while the exact Pb sources still remain unclear. Our purpose is to investigate the key factors that account for the concentration increase of Pb accumulated in Longjing tea based on a broad regional scale. Eighty-one young tea leaves and corresponding soil and air samples where the tea plants grow in and around, respectively, were collected from three typical Longjing tea gardens for illustrating the sources of Pb that accumulated in Longjing tea. The sampling lines were arranged with the proximity to the traffic area. Pb concentrations in the tea leaves and soil and air samples were determined, respectively. Wash procedures were also conducted to trace the removable possibility and rates of Pb in young tea leaves. Simple statistical analysis and spatial geostatistics were further applied for the investigation of the potential relationship of Pb levels among young tea leaves and the relevant soil and air samples. The regional differences and seasonal variation of Pb concentration were found for young tea leaves, with the order of Longwu > Meijiawu > Longjing and spring > summer (p < 0.05), respectively. The significant positive correlation was found only for the Pb concentration between young tea leaves and air samples (r = 0.34, p < 0.01). The results from wash experiment showed that a substantial portion of Pb in young tea leaves could be removed by wash, and the removable rates of Pb showed an obvious decrease with the increasing distance from the traffic area in Longwu and Meijiawu. A similar geographic distribution tendency of Pb between young tea leaves and air was also revealed by further geographic spatial analysis taking Longwu as a case. The significant correlations and similar distribution tendency of Pb concentration between young tea leaves and air suggested that atmospheric deposition could be an important, even predominant, source for Pb accumulated in Longjin tea. This non-edaphic contribution was further validated in wash experiment and testified to be distance dependent on the proximity to the main traffic area. This might be attributed to the large rough pubescent surface of tea leaves which are conducive to foliar deposition and/or absorption of Pb. The lack of correlations between young tea leaves Pb and soil Pb indicated that the contribution of soil Pb would be limited (especially near the traffic area where the influence of atmospheric Pb was dominant) and might be attributed to the low bioavailability of Pb in soils and finite uptake and transport of Pb from roots to shoots. Meanwhile, the higher Pb concentration in spring teas (compared with summer teas) might be due to the long growth period that allowed for a long time interception of Pb by young tea leaves through atmospheric deposition. The Pb that rooted in air was suggested as the main source accounting for the accumulation of Pb in Longjing Tea of the tested tea gardens. This non-edaphic contribution of atmospheric deposition was distance dependent on the proximity to the main traffic area. For alleviating the accumulation and elevation of Pb amount in Longjing Tea, efforts should be made especially during the period of spring tea growth. The additional wash procedure was also recommended before the tea leaf processing in factories.

J	Vitanova, RM; Fernández, P; Grimalt, JO				Vitanova, RM; Fernández, P; Grimalt, JO			Polychlorinated biphenyl partitioning in the waters of a remote mountain lake	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The dissolved-particulate phase distribution of polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) in the waters of a high mountain lake (Redo Lake, Pyrenees) has been studied. The lake is oligotrophic and its water hydrology is dominated by atmospheric precipitation; inputs from catchment or other sources are not significant. Samples were collected in several periods encompassing the summer and winter seasons. The PCB congener concentrations were rather uniform both in terms of water depth and seasonality showing steady state conditions. Seventy percent of the variation of the PCB particulate-dissolved phase coefficient (K-d) was correlated with temperature and log octanol-water (K-ow), Lower temperatures and hydrophobicity involved a higher association with the particulate phase. This behavior is consistent with the predominance of plankton among suspended particles following a two compartment model. Thus, temperature dependence seems mainly related to a rapid phase transfer mechanism such as surface adsorption to the cell membranes and log K-ow influence could reflect steric restrictions for the uptake of these compounds upon algal ingestion.

J	García-Berthou, E				García-Berthou, E			Size- and depth-dependent variation in habitat and diet of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio)	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The habitat and diet variation of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were studied in Lake Banyoles (Catalonia, Spain). Carp was the second most abundant species offshore and used more the littoral in spring and deep bottoms in winter. The diet of carp was based on detritus, amphipods (Echinogammarus sp.), phantom midge larvae (Chaoborus flavicans), diatom mucilages, and plant debris. Amphipods and phantom midge larvae were much more important in diet than previous studies found, because of their greater availability in this lake. Among the carp inhabiting deep waters, there was size-dependent variation in diet. with smaller carp selecting more meiobenthos (cladocerans, ostracods, and small chironomids) and larger carp preying on profundal macrobenthos (phantom midge larvae and large chironomids). Roach (Rutilus rutilus) and carp dominated in abundance the non-littoral zone of the lake and showed resource partitioning, with roach being a more efficient zooplanktivore and carp being more able to prey on hard material (plant seeds, mollusks, and ostracods).

Introduced as fingerlings into a small lake in the river system in the Province of Quebec, the fish moved downstream, increasing the species' range and abundance. At least 60 fish have been collected in New Brunswick since 1988, most at hydroelectric dams in the upper and middle stretches of the river. A limited summer and winter fishery for Muskellunge has developed in a lake in the northwestern part of the province. Lengths-at-age suggest that the river fish are growing rapidly. The oldest fish was VI+. Some fish of both sexes appear to mature at age III+. The presence of young-of-the-year fish and the condition of the gonads indicate that spawning has occurred and that the muskie is capable of establishing self-sustaining local populations in the river.																			0008-3550					APR-JUN	1999	113	2					230	234																WOS:000080945500004

A.; Andersen, Bjorn G.; Kelley, Samuel E.; Finkel, Robert C.; Schwartz, Roseanne			Mismatch of glacier extent and summer insolation in Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes	GEOLOGY												Here we address a long-standing puzzle of ice-age climate called the "fly in the ointment of the Milankovitch theory." Using geomorphic mapping and Be-10 surface-exposure dating, we show that five moraine belts were formed during maxima of the last ice age by the Pukaki glacier in New Zealand's Southern Alps. They afford ages of 41.76 +/- 1.09 ka, 35.50 +/- 1.26 ka, 27.17 +/- 0.68 ka, 20.27 +/- 0.60 ka, and 18.29 +/- 0.49 ka. These five maxima spanned an entire precessional cycle in summer insolation intensity at the latitude of the Southern Alps. A similar mismatch between summer insolation and glacier extent also characterized the Chilean Lake District in the mid-latitudes of South America. Thus, in apparent contrast to northern ice sheets linked by Milankovitch to summer insolation at 65 degrees N latitude, the behavior of southern mid-latitude glaciers was not tied to local summer insolation intensity. Instead, glacier extent between 41.76 ka and 18.29 ka, as well as during the last termination, was aligned with Southern Ocean surface temperature and with atmospheric carbon dioxide.

Sensitivity of AMSR-E Brightness Temperatures to the Seasonal Evolution of Lake Ice Thickness	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												The sensitivity of brightness temperature (T(B)) at 6.9, 10.7, and 18.7 GHz from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) observations is investigated over five winter seasons (2002-2007) on Great Bear Lake and Great Slave Lake, Northwest Territories, Canada. The T(B) measurements are compared to ice thicknesses obtained with a previously validated thermodynamic lake ice model. Lake ice thickness is found to explain much of the increase of T(B) at 10.7 and 18.7 GHz. T(B) acquired at 18.7 GHz (V-pol) and 10.7 GHz (H-pol) shows the strongest relation with simulated lake ice thickness over the period of study (R(2) > 0.90). A comparison of the seasonal evolution of T(B) for a cold winter (2003-2004) and a warm winter (2005-2006) reveals that the relationship between T(B) and ice growth is stronger in the cold winter (2003-2004). Overall, this letter shows the high sensitivity of T(B) to ice growth and, thus, the potential of AMSR-E mid-frequency channels to estimate ice thickness on large northern lakes.

Hydrology and management of turloughs (temporary lakes) affect marsh fly (Sciomyzidae: Diptera) communities	INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY												Hydrology and management affect dipteran communities in wetlands and they, themselves, have the potential to influence prey communities. Turloughs are temporary lakes unique to Ireland. Their vegetation is ecotonal on a dry-wet continuum and, due to differing summer management practises, shows a diversity of vegetation lengths. Marsh flies (Sciomyzidae), a taxon that has potential as wetland bio-indicators, were chosen to investigate management, hydrological and prey effects on turloughs. Summer collections of Sciomyzidae were made on 24 homogeneous zones across ten turloughs. At each position that flies were collected, vegetation surveys were conducted to utilise Ellenberg indices as surrogate environmental variables. Winter collections of Molluscs were made on 21 zones. Sciomyzidae showed maximum total abundance and species richness at sites intermediate on the dry-wet gradient, supporting the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Indicator species analysis gave site-specific preferences: most species favoured the site with the longest vegetation, but the smallest species showed a significant preference for the site with the shortest vegetation. Across the full hydrological gradient, known terrestrial snail-killers were indicators of drier poor-grasslands and known hygrophilous species were indicators of the wettest zones. Generalised linear models for abundance of the dominant species consistently showed negative relationships with total prey abundance. However, sciomyzid communities showed no significant co-structure with prey communities, but did with sampling conditions, and management/hydrological variables. Sciomyzid communities change qualitatively and quantitatively with vegetation structure and hydrology and correlative evidence for predation pressure by the dominant species highlights the potential of Sciomyzidae to control the intermediate host of fascioliasis.																			1752-458X	1752-4598				NOV	2009	2	4					270	283		10.1111/j.1752-4598.2009.00064.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-4598.2009.00064.x													WOS:000271049900004

Assessment of dust activity and dust-plume pathways over Jazmurian Basin, southeast Iran	AEOLIAN RESEARCH												Jazmurian (or hamun-e Jaz Murian) is a dried lake located in a topographic-low basin in southeast Iran and a major source for high dust emissions under favorable weather conditions. This work examines for the first time the dust activity over the basin by classifying the dust events (DEs, visibility <10 km) and dust-storm events (DSEs, visibility <1 km) based on observations at five local meteorological stations during the period 1990-2013. Analysis of the temporal evolution, seasonality, frequency and persistence (duration) of the DEs and DSEs, along with examination of the backward and forward air-mass trajectories in the Jazmurian Basin are the main objectives of the present study. The DEs exhibit maximum frequency in June-July and lowest in autumn and winter, while the DSEs peak mostly during March-May also presenting large variability between the stations. The frequency of both the DEs and DSEs increases during similar to 2001-2004 due to a prolonged drought over southeastern Iran, while no significant tendency is found during the period 1990-2013. Further, the DEs and DSEs exhibit a clear diurnal pattern with highest frequency between 15:30 and 18:30 LST due to thermal convection and transported dust plumes. The analysis reveals an average frequency of 12.7 dust-storm days per year, while the DSEs last for 5.1 h, on average, during the dust-storm days. The dust storms originating from Jazmurian affect mostly the northern coast of the Arabian Sea (Makran mountains), the Oman Sea, the southeastern Arabian Peninsula and the western Pakistan, while air masses from the arid/desert areas of central-eastern Iran and Arabia seem to further aggravate the dust-aerosol loading over Jazmurian.

Biogeography and co-occurrence of 16 planktonic species of Keratella Bory de St. Vincent, 1822 (Rotifera, Ploima, Brachionidae) in lakes and reservoirs of the United States	ZOOTAXA												We report current distributions of 16 species of Keratella Bory de St. Vincent, 1822 within lakes and reservoirs of the U.S. Specimens were identified from 988 lakes and reservoirs during spring and summer 2012 as part of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Lakes Assessment (NLA). We performed a co-occurrence analysis to determine correlations between species-pair occurrences and a niche-centroid analysis to predict optimal water quality conditions for each species. While a high degree of overlap in geographic range was observed among the species, distribution maps showed that K. quadrata was largely confined to more northern latitudes and K. americana was confined primarily to the eastern U.S. Other common species were either ubiquitously or sparsely distributed across ecoregions, suggesting that their distribution may be more related to inter-species competition or local water quality parameters.

Apart from these well-studied environments, we have also included recent exploration of the hot springs located in the East-Tuvinian upland, the Chukchi Peninsula, Sakhalin, and the North Caucasus. First, we discuss taxonomy of all above-mentioned thermophilic prokaryotes. Second, we consider the main energy-providing processes, based primarily on redox reactions of inorganic (mainly sulfur and iron) and organic compounds. Then, we discuss in detail the thermophilic prokaryotes involved in the carbon cycle: from CO2-assimilating chemolithoautotrophs to heterotrophs capable of hydrolyzing complex organic matter. Last, we discuss uncultivated lineages of thermophilic bacteria and archaea, which are present or even predominant in the thermal environments.

The core was studied for molecular compositions of n-alkanes, stable carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13) of organic matter (OM), total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and trace elements. Evidence from n-alkanes, cross chart of C/N-delta C-13 values and trace elements indicated the organic matter derived from a mixed source composed of autochthonous aquatic organisms and allochthonous terrestrial plants, and the sediments mainly deposited in reducing conditions, which is in favor of preservation and accumulation of OM. Variations of n-alkanes biomarker proxies, delta C-13 of organic matter and Mo concentrations reflected three stages of paleoclimate evolution during the past 30 cal ka BP: a relatively warm and humid climate between 29.1 and 22.9 cal ka BP, corresponding to a strong southwest summer monsoon; climate shifted towards cold and dry condition during the period of 22.9-15.7 cal ka BP, in response to the reduced insolation and weakened southwest summer monsoon; temperature and humidity gradually increased in the Holocene with fluctuations, broadly track the strengthening trend of southwest summer monsoon. Our findings further confirm that variations in solar activity may primarily affect the strength of southwest summer monsoon, resulting in the shifts of paleoclimate conditions.

The plant was sampled monthly for one year from 6 sites distributed equally along the northern and southern parts of this lake. Monthly significant variation in all investigated sediment and water nutrients for the northern and southern sites was recorded. The biomass of P. australis in the southern sites was greater than that of the northern sites; in addition, the above-ground biomass was greater than the below-ground biomass. The above-ground biomass increased from February until it reached its maximum during August and then decreased again. Likewise, the highest nutrient concentrations in the different tissues were recorded at the beginning of the growing season during winter and early spring and then gradually decreased with increasing plant biomass. Moreover, the nutrient content (g/m(2)) increased from the early growing season (February) and reached its peak during April-August and then decreased. Based on our results, P. australis could be used for the extraction of nutrients to reduce the eutrophication in Lake Burullus, if the above-ground biomass is harvested at its maximum value in August, as was the case regarding the maximum content of most nutrients.

Fishers' main sustainability concerns included degradation of the environment, overfishing, and lack of decision-making power. The fishery and fishing have changed due to increased water temperature and lake productivity; the open-water period has become longer and winter fishing season shorter and spring-spawning species, such as pike and perch, have become more common. Fishers' responses to reduce risks and cope with future uncertainty included both long- and short-term adaptation-achieved through diversification, flexibility, innovation, and mobility. The responses of fishers to multiple changes are variable and based on individual rather than community behavior. We argue that diverse fishing strategies support the adaptation capacity and sustainability of commercial fishing. Sustainable adaptation of commercial inland fisheries could be further enhanced by better monitoring of the hydrology and fishery, by supporting social relations and communication, and through decision-making based on both scientific and fishers' knowledge.

Life history and population dynamics of invasive common carp, Cyprinus carpio, within a large turbid African impoundment	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												As one of the most widely established freshwater fishes globally, the invasive success of common carp, Cyprinus carpio, is beyond dispute. Although detailed knowledge on its biology would assist in its management, relatively few life history studies have investigated C. carpio outside of its natural range. The present study analyses the life history and population structure of exotic C. carpio in a 364 km(2) African impoundment. We used whole astericus otoliths to show that C. carpio attained ages of up to 7 years and grew more rapidly than has been recorded for any population from Europe or Australia. Macroscopic staging of gonads indicated protracted spawning, with highest reproductive activity observed during late spring and early summer. Total mortality, natural mortality and fishing mortality rates were estimated at 0.72, 0.60 and 0.12 year(-1) respectively. Life history comparisons across the species' global distribution showed large variations in growth and longevity, whereas early maturation (2-3 years) appeared to be a rather conservative trait. The combination of early maturity, fast growth and relatively high natural mortality rates suggests a rapid population growth potential associated with high resilience to management interventions once C. carpio has been introduced.					; Booth, Anthony/C-9932-2012	Weyl, Olaf/0000-0002-8935-3296; Booth, Anthony/0000-0002-5561-9260													1323-1650	1448-6059					2011	62	11					1270	1280		10.1071/MF11054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF11054													WOS:000296440400002

A number of mechanisms, including both abiotic and biotic processes, buffer the respective states against changes, whereas other mechanisms likely drive transitions between states. Our earlier research shows that a large proportion of zooplanktivorous fish populations in shallow lakes undertake seasonal migrations where they leave the lake during winter and migrate back to the lake in spring. Based on our past research, we propose a number of scenarios of how feedback processes between the individual and ecosystem levels may affect stability of alternative stable states in shallow lakes when mediated by fish migration. Migration effects on shallow lakes result from processes at different scales, from the individual to the ecosystem. Our earlier research has shown that ecosystem properties, including piscivore abundance and zooplankton productivity, affect the individual state of zooplanktivorous fish, such as growth rate or condition. Individual state, in turn, affects the relative proportion and timing of migrating zooplanktivorous fish. This change, in turn, may stabilize states or cause runaway processes that eventually lead to state shifts. Consequently, such knowledge of processes coupled to seasonal migration of planktivorous fish should increase our understanding of shallow lake dynamics.

Fish caged beneath the ice showed symptoms of asphyxiation or gas bubble disease, depending on depth. Asphyxiation occured at O2 concentrations below 4 mg/l. Total dissolved gas tension was identified as the primary cause of bubble disease and resting mortality. The relative contribution of O2 and N2 to total gas tension was demonstrated. Significant mortalities were associated with O2 relative partial pressures (gas partial pressure relative to total hydrostatic pressure) exceeding 0.2, but only when accompanied by N2 relative partial pressures above 1.1. Total relative gas tension under these circumstances exceeded 1.3. An increase in N2 partial pressures over the winter was attributed to the physical freeze-out of N2 from the ice in shallow lakes where reduction of lake volume due to ice formation is substantial.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1985	42	2					268	279		10.1139/f85-034	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f85-034													WOS:A1985ACG6500007

Influence of hydrophyte abundance on the spatial distribution of zooplankton in selected lakes in Greece	HYDROBIOLOGIA					12th International Symposium on Aquatic Weeds	AUG 24-28, 2009	Jyvaskyla, FINLAND	European Weed Res Soc				Submerged hydrophyte vegetation consists of a highly important biotic component of maintaining lake ecosystems towards a "clear water" ecological status. Aquatic macrophytes are well known to play a significant multidimensional role in lakes by competing with phytoplankton growth, stabilising sediment and offering refuge to fishes, macro-invertebrates and littoral zooplankton, amongst others. Zooplanktons that are associated with macrophyte beds, in particular, may act as a positive feedback mechanism that contributes to maintaining a clear-water state. Although there are several studies investigating the relationships between macrophytes and zooplankton in European lakes, few have yet been carried out in Greek lakes. Seasonal field sampling was conducted from spring 2006 to autumn 2008 in four lakes of northwestern Greece. Zooplankton samples were collected from within hydrophyte beds in each lake to estimate their relative abundance and species density. Hydrophyte abundance and composition was recorded on a five-point scale. Moreover, water samples were analysed to determine nutrient and chlorophyll-a concentration. Pearson correlations between zooplankton density and key physicochemical variables were conducted to distinguish significant abiotic variables related with major zooplankton groups. Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric analysis was used to test for significant differences in zooplankton composition and environmental variables amongst the five hydrophyte abundance classes. In addition, Canonical correspondence analysis was used to distinguish possible correlations amongst the macrophyte and zooplankton species. Zooplankton density was significantly higher in dense macrophyte vegetation. Small-sized species (e.g. Rotifera) dominated the zooplankton community, indicating the eutrophic nature of the lakes. Large Cladocera were present in low abundance and were mostly littoral. The current research contributes to a better understanding of relationships between biotic groups in selected Greek lakes.

Seasonal measurements of water table level and depth profiles of pH, dissolved CN4, CO2, O-2, SO42-, NO3-, formate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate were made at two adjacent sites 1.5 to 2 m apart. Dissolved CH4 was inversely correlated to O-2 and, in general, to NO3- and SO42-, potential inhibitors of methanogenesis. At low water table levels (August 1992), maximal CH4 (2 to 4 mu M) occurred below 30 cm, whereas at high water table levels (October 1992) or under flooded conditions (May 1993), CH4 maxima (4 to 55 mu M) occurred in the top 10 to 20 cm. Higher CH4 concentrations were likely supported by inputs of fresh organic matter from decaying leaf litter, as suggested by high acetate and propionate concentrations (25 to 100 mu M) in one of the sites in fall and spring. Measurements of potential CH4 production (and consumption) showed that the highest rates generally occurred in the top 10 cm of soil. Soil slurry incubations confirmed the importance of organic matter to CH4 production but also showed that competition for substrates by nonmethanogenic microorganisms could greatly attenuate its effect.																			0099-2240					NOV	1994	60	11					3945	3951		10.1128/AEM.60.11.3945-3951.1994	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.60.11.3945-3951.1994								16349429					WOS:A1994PP13900008

Population Characteristics and the Suppression of Nonnative Burbot	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Burbot Lota lota were illegally introduced into the Green River, Wyoming, drainage and have since proliferated throughout the system. Burbot in the Green River pose a threat to native species and to socially, economically, and ecologically important recreational fisheries. Therefore, managers of the Green River are interested in implementing a suppression program for Burbot. We collected demographic data on Burbot in the Green River (summer and autumn 2013) and used the information to construct an age-based population model (female-based Leslie matrix) to simulate the population-level response of Burbot to the selective removal of different age-classes. Burbot in the Green River grew faster, matured at relatively young ages, and were highly fecund compared with other Burbot populations within the species' native distribution. The age-structured population model, in conjunction with demographic information, indicated that the Burbot population in the Green River could be expected to increase under current conditions. The model also indicated that the Burbot population in the Green River would decline once total annual mortality reached 58%. The population growth of Burbot in the Green River was most sensitive to age-0 and age-1 mortality. The age-structured population model indicated that an increase in mortality, particularly for younger age-classes, would result in the effective suppression of the Burbot population in the Green River.																			0275-5947	1548-8675					2016	36	5					1006	1017		10.1080/02755947.2016.1173137	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2016.1173137													WOS:000384318700005

The impact of an extreme flood in spring/summer 2010 on phytoplankton communities in oxbow lakes of the lower Vistula River, central Poland	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												In 2010, central Europe was hit by a massive flood. The main objective of this study was to assess the impact of this natural disaster on phytoplankton communities in four oxbow lakes of the lower Vistula River. In order to explain changes caused by the flood, the data from the year 2010 were compared with the data from the previous year. In summer 2009, the abundance and biomass of phytoplankton as well as chlorophyll a content in small isolated oxbow lakes were relatively low. Small nanoplankton flagellates prevailed. Much higher abundance and biomass of phytoplankton and chlorophyll a content were recorded in a large oxbow lake, characterized by the predominance of filamentous cyanobacteria. After the flood wave, the abundance and biomass of phytoplankton in the small oxbow lakes increased dramatically (18 and 7 times, respectively), but the number of species decreased. Filamentous cyanobacteria (Dolichospermum), euglenophyta and dinoflagellates were identified. In the large oxbow lake, the number of species increased but the abundance and biomass of phytoplankton decreased (by approximately 60 and 75%). There was a shift in dominant algal species. Cyanobacteria were replaced mainly by cryptophyta, small chlorophyta (Chlamydomonas) and xanthophyta (Heterothrix). The least significant changes were recorded in the Vistula River. Here, before and after the flood, the abundance and biomass of phytoplankton as well as chlorophyll a content and the dominant algal species remained unchanged. The massive flood caused severe environmental stress, which disturbed phytoplankton development and led to shifts between clear water and turbid states in the lakes.

Mercury in water and biomass of microbial communities in hot springs of Yellowstone National Park, USA	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Ultra-clean sampling methods and approaches typically used in pristine environments were applied to quantify concentrations of Hg species in water and microbial biomass from hot springs of Yellowstone National Park, features that are geologically enriched with Hg. Microbial populations of chemically-diverse hot springs were also characterized using modern methods in molecular biology as the initial step toward ongoing work linking Hg speciation with microbial processes. Molecular methods (amplification of environmental DNA using 16S rDNA primers, cloning, denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) screening of clone libraries, and sequencing of representative clones) were used to examine the dominant members of microbial communities in hot springs. Total Hg (THg), monomethylated Hg (MeHg), pH, temperature, and other parameters influential to Hg speciation and microbial ecology are reported for hot springs water and associated microbial mats. Several hot springs indicate the presence of MeHg in microbial mats with concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 ng g(-1) (dry weight). Concentrations of THg in mats ranged from 4.9 to 120,000 ng g(-1) (dry weight). Combined data from surveys of geothermal water, lakes, and streams show that aqueous THg concentrations range from 1 to 600 ng L-1. Species and concentrations of THg in mats and water vary significantly between hot springs, as do the microorganisms found at each site.

The ROV was equipped with a high-resolution, low-light, black-and-white video camera and two halogen headlamps and was tethered by a 152-m umbilical cable. We used the ROV to sample two central Ontario lakes: Source Lake in summer and fall and Lake Opeongo in summer. We surveyed the lake bottom at depths of 2.5-40 m in both lakes during day and night. The ROV traveled slightly above the substrate recording a field of view 1.8 m wide and 0.3-0.5 m high at a distance of 1.8 m in front of the ROV. Overall, 54,594 m(2) of lake bottom were sampled, and 114 juvenile lake trout (<300 mm, total length) were observed. Juvenile lake trout exhibited minimal avoidance of the ROV with some individuals being observed for several minutes (mean, 41.6 s). The observed distribution suggested movement to shallower habitat at night. Mean (+/-SE) lake trout densities varied between the study lakes for depths of 5-25 m (Opeongo: 5.2 +/- 2.0 fish/ha; Source: 25.9 +/- 6.5 fish/ha), which was consistent with catch per unit effort in small-mesh gill nets for these lakes (Opeongo: 0.9 +/- 0.1 fish/net-night; Source: 5.8 +/- 0.4 fish/net-night). The ROV allowed nonlethal sampling and direct estimation of fish density, thereby offering a good alternative to conventional netting techniques.																			0002-8487					SEP	1997	126	5					871	875		10.1577/1548-8659(1997)126<0871:UOAROV>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1997)126<0871:UOAROV>2.3.CO;2													WOS:000071083800016

Annual productivity and daily average productivity were very close with both methods: 107-205 g of C per m2/yr for sulfate and 89-117 g of C per m2/yr for frequency of dividing cells. Zooplankton feeding removed 2-10% of the bacterial net production annually. When compared with biomass changes and losses due to zooplankton feeding, production values were very high. Other loss factors have to be more important than zooplankton feeding in controlling the bacterial population. Bacterial heterotrophic production was .apprx. 50% of gross primary production.

J	Uliana, MM; Sharp, JM				Uliana, MM; Sharp, JM			Tracing regional flow paths to major springs in Trans-Pecos Texas using geochemical data and geochemical models	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												San Solomon, Giffin, and Phantom Lake Springs, located in Trans-Pecos Texas, have a high TDS, Na-Cl-SO4 baseflow component derived from a regional flow system and a low TDS, mixed cation-mixed anion stormflow component derived from local precipitation events. The hypothesis that the regional flow system maintaining baseflow spring discharge originates in the Salt Basin and flows through the Apache Mountains towards the springs is tested with historical geochemical data from wells and springs. Data from over 1400 wells in the study area over a 50-year period were analyzed and used to delineate 11 hydrochemical facies based on the predominant ions. Geochemical data from samples along the hypothesized regional flow path indicate a trend of increasing dissolved solids and Cl-HCO3 ratios and decreasing Na-Cl ratios. These are consistent with evolution of groundwater in an unconfined regional system dominated by carbonates and evaporites. In the bicarbonate facies, the waters represent recent recharge modified by mineral dissolution and cation exchange. In the sulfate zones, the hydrochemical facies are controlled by gypsum, anhydrite, and halite dissolution, cation exchange, and mixing with Na-Cl waters. In the chloride zones, the hydrochemical facies are controlled by halite dissolution and irrigation return flow. Spring discharge chemistry is most similar to chloride zone waters; Na-Cl and Ca-SO4 ratios suggest that baseflow is derived from the chloride zone waters upgradient along the hypothesized flow path. PHREEQC modeled groundwater evolution along the hypothesized flow path and spring discharge under stormflow and baseflow conditions. Results indicate that: (1) hydrochemistry along the regional flow path is controlled by dissolution of halite, gypsum, dolomite, and CO2 and by precipitation of calcite; (2) baseflow spring discharge is derived primarily from this regional flow system; and (3) spring discharge after major storm events can constitute as much as 72% local recharge that is further modified by dissolution of calcite, gypsum, and CO2. Data analysis and model results suggest that cave formation in this system is occurs during major storm events.

Bacterial and Phytoplankton Responses to Nutrient Amendments in a Boreal Lake Differ According to Season and to Taxonomic Resolution	PLOS ONE												Nutrient limitation and resource competition in bacterial and phytoplankton communities may appear different when considering different levels of taxonomic resolution. Nutrient amendment experiments conducted in a boreal lake on three occasions during one open water season revealed complex responses in overall bacterioplankton and phytoplankton abundance and biovolume. In general, bacteria were dominant in spring, while phytoplankton was clearly the predominant group in autumn. Seasonal differences in the community composition of bacteria and phytoplankton were mainly related to changes in observed taxa, while the differences across nutrient treatments within an experiment were due to changes in relative contributions of certain higher-and lower-level phylogenetic groups. Of the main bacterioplankton phyla, only Actinobacteria had a treatment response that was visible even at the phylum level throughout the season. With increasing resolution (from 75 to 99% sequence similarity) major responses to nutrient amendments appeared using 454 pyrosequencing data of 16S rRNA amplicons. This further revealed that OTUs (defined by 97% sequence similarity) annotated to the same highly resolved freshwater groups appeared to occur during different seasons and were showing treatment-dependent differentiation, indicating that OTUs within these groups were not ecologically coherent. Similarly, phytoplankton species from the same genera responded differently to nutrient amendments even though biovolumes of the majority of taxa increased when both nitrogen and phosphorus were added simultaneously. The bacterioplankton and phytoplankton community compositions showed concurrent trajectories that could be seen in synchronous succession patterns over the season. Overall, our data revealed that the response of both communities to nutrient changes was highly dependent on season and that contradictory results may be obtained when using different taxonomic resolutions.					; Eiler, Alexander/V-9220-2017; Jones, Roger/C-7703-2011	Peura, Sari/0000-0003-3892-8157; Eiler, Alexander/0000-0001-9916-9567; Tiirola, Marja/0000-0001-5589-3748; Jones, Roger/0000-0002-0835-8264; Hiltunen, Minna/0000-0002-0003-3000													1932-6203					JUN 8	2012	7	6							e38552	10.1371/journal.pone.0038552	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0038552								22715392					WOS:000305336800034

In this study, the phosphorus concentrations in algal samples collected from the lake in 2015-2016 were determined in the laboratory. From the concentration data, the total quantity of algal phosphorus was calculated and the seasonal variations in algal phosphorus were examined. The results indicated that the intracellular phosphorus content of Microcystis in Taihu varied from 0.044 to 0.130 pg/cell and tended to be high in spring and low in summer. The total amount of algal phosphorus in Taihu Lake ranged between 7.78 and 97.32 t over the study period. Algal phosphorus only accounted for between 1.5 and 18.5% of the phosphorus stock in the water. Because Microcystis accumulated downwind, there was a tendency for the total phosphorus concentrations to be low in the east of the lake and high in the west of the lake. This new information about the spatial and temporal distribution of algal phosphorus contributes to our understanding of how phosphorus in Microcystis contributes to phosphorus circulation in Taihu Lake.					; Zhu, Wei/P-3555-2015; Xue, Zongpu/JXX-1602-2024; Feng, Ganyu/HCI-6688-2022; Lv, Yi/E-3343-2010	Wang, Ruochen/0000-0002-7350-6470; Feng, Ganyu/0000-0002-7497-7469; Lv, Yi/0000-0002-7104-2414														2617-4782					2021	3	1					213	222		10.2166/bgs.2021.013	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/bgs.2021.013													WOS:000760241900001

However, few studies have investigated this combined effect. Here we tested the effects of warming (elevated 3celcius) and cDOM input (three levels of humic river water addition) on GPP in autumn (2 months including open water and ice-covered periods) in experimental pond ecosystems. The cDOM input decreased whole-ecosystem GPP at natural temperature conditions mainly as a result of lower benthic GPP not fully counteracted by an increase in pelagic GPP, while warming increased whole-ecosystem GPP due to a positive response of mainly pelagic GPP at all levels of cDOM input. Warming delayed autumn ice cover formation by 2 weeks but did not affect light availability in the water column compared to ambient ice-covered treatments. Gross primary production during this period was still affected by warming and cDOM. The results stress the importance of accounting for multiple climate drivers and habitats when predicting lake GPP responses to climate change. We conclude that climate change may shift whole-ecosystem GPP through different responses of habitat-specific GPP to increasing cDOM inputs and warming.					; Al-Haidarey, Mohammed Jawad/ABA-4782-2021; Ali, Mohammed Jawad/Q-8166-2018; Hamdan, Mohammed/HMD-4935-2023	Hamdan, Mohammed/0000-0003-4068-2109; Karlsson, Jan/0000-0001-5730-0694; Ali, Mohammed Jawad/0000-0001-5135-9345; Hotchkiss, Erin/0000-0001-6132-9107; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				MAY	2021	66	5					815	825		10.1111/fwb.13679	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13679		JAN 2021											WOS:000605639200001

Resistance in gram positive and gram negative bacteria is common including a high frequency of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Tuberculosis is prevalent with drug-resistant and multi-drug resistant M. tuberculosis being an increasing problem. Infection with Borrelia spp. is common in forested areas. Small outbreaks of legioneflosis are reported as nosocomial infections. Viruses Outbreaks of hepatitis A re recorded regularly and tick-borne encephalitis is seen throughout Russia and the eastern European countries. Eastern Europe (Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria) Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever is observed during warm season and Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is registered in Russia, Czech Republic, Slovakia and northeast Poland. HIV is increasing among the homeless and intravenuous drug abusers. Parasites Local transmission of malaria in Russia is low and unstable, and occurs in selected areas at the border with Azerbaijan, recreational lakes for swimming in the Moscow city and Moscow region. Autochthonous Plasmodium vivax infections are mostly reported among urban population and constitute up to 47.5% of all imported and domestic malaria cases registered in the Russian Federation every year. Tertian malaria should be considered in a differential diagnosis of a febrile traveler from Russia in a warmer season from late spring to early autumn Key symptoms are fever, chills, weakness, sweating, headache, bone and joint pain, anemia, and acute onset. Infections very typical and characteristic for EE countries. Local outbreaks of trichinosis occurred in the most of eastern Europe territories. Infections caused by raw of under-cooked meat from wild animals (boar, bear) are typically observed in many members of the same family or in groups of hunters. Infections are seasonal, and mostly observed in spring and late autumn. Key symptoms included fever, muslc epain, periorbital edema, abdominal pain, short-term waterly diarrhea, elevated muscle enzymes, and cosinophilia. Echinococcus granulosus is a main infectious cause of single or multiple cystic lesions in the liver, mostly located in the right lobe. In Poland, about 10% of all space-occupying lesions in the liver are caused by E. granulosus. Having a dog in a small private farm and local slaughtering in a household may be helpful in an epidemiological interview. Cystic echinococcosis in humans from Central and East Europe is caused by "pig" straing of the parasite with genotypes G7 or G9. Infections with a "sheep" strain of E. granuiosus which dominates in majority countries of the world have not been documented in countries of eastern Europe. Key symptoms are abdominal discomfort, right upper quadrant pain, and liver cysts usually accidentally diagnosed by ultrasonography. Due to some culinary traditions and dietary habits, taeniasis is a common intestinal parasitic infection in eastern Europe; Taenia saginata is the most prevalent species. Small outbreaks in families are reported. Cysticercosis due to a larval form of Taenia solitan is sporadically observed in agricultural workers from pigs-raising areas with single, usually calcified, spce-occupying lesions of the brain. Toxocara cati and canis responsible for the syndroms of visceral or ocular larva migrans are frequently observed in children and adolescents, similarly from urban agglomerations and agricultural regions. Clinical picture includes hypereosinophilia with leucocytosis, hepatosplenomegaly, nonspecific abdominal pain, weight loss, subretinal or liver granulomas, visual impairment, asthma, chronic urticaria, and other allergic disorders.

Viability and hatchability of brine shrimp Artemia franciscana cysts after passing through the digestive system of eared grebes Podiceps nigricollis	JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY												Brine shrimp Artemia franciscana provide food for many migrating and staging birds that spend summer and fall on Great Salt Lake, Utah, USA. Artemia produce live young and cysts (hard-walled eggs); these cysts are commercially harvested on Great Salt Lake and support a large industry in Utah. It is unclear the impact that millions of hungry birds have on the Artemia population in the lake. To help assess that, this study evaluated cyst viability (percentage of cysts that contain an embryo) and hatchability (percent of cysts that hatch) from cysts that had passed through the digestive tract of eared grebes Podiceps nigricollis and cysts obtained directly from Great Salt Lake at the same site where each grebe was collected. Hatchability was significantly higher for cysts collected from the water column (19%) than from the stomach (0.3%) or intestines (3%) of eared grebes. Viability also was significantly different for cysts collected from the water column (29%), stomach (0.7%), and intestines (5%). These results indicate that eared grebes nutritionally benefit from eating cysts and that they may be an important food source for grebes in late fall after the adult population of Artemia dies off due to the water becoming too cold. Also, enough cysts survive their passage through the digestive system that grebes can vector hatchable cysts to other waterbodies.

Stomach contents of 308 individuals ranging in size from 73 to 275 mm total length were analyzed and 55.2% were empty. The fullness index indicated that feeding intensity of this species was the highest in summer and the lowest in winter. European perch feeds on prey fish and macroinvertebrates. The most important food items were Scardinius erythrophthalmus and Perca fluviatilis, followed by chironomidae larvae. Diet composition and feeding habits varied seasonally and ontogenetically. Macroinvertebrates were only consumed by small individuals, while prey fishes were only eaten by large individuals. S. erythrophthalmus, P. fluviatilis, and Blicca bjoerkna were positively selected but their selection indexes were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). This prey selection is important for combating eutrophication. Abramis brama constitute 24.03% of all fish species in this lake; however, it was a negatively selected prey item (V-a = -0.198, (2)= 7.86, p < 0.05). Esox lucius, Squalius cephalus, Chondrostoma regium, and Carassius gibelio inhabiting this lake were not preferred by European perch.

Eutrophication and climate warming alter spatial (depth) co-occurrence patterns of lake phytoplankton assemblages	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The composition and dynamics of plankton communities are critically affected by human-induced environmental changes. We analysed 33 years of phytoplankton monthly data collected in Lake Zurich (Switzerland), assigning organisms (genus level) to taxonomic groups (class, family), Reynolds associations and size categories. The aim was to understand how eutrophication and climate change have influenced taxa co-occurrence patterns within and between groups over the lake water column (14 depths, 0-135 m), using null-models to test for non-random spatial (depth) assembly. We found that the whole community showed high taxa co-occurrence levels, significantly deviating over time from random assembly concurrently with lake warming and reduced nutrient loading. This pattern was driven mostly by the depth structure of metalimnetic assemblages during summer and autumn. The prevalence of non-random spatial patterns changed for different taxonomic and functional groups, with only few significant deviations from null-model expectations. Within taxonomic and functional groups (particularly Classes and size categories), the frequency of spatial overdispersion of taxa decreased over time while the frequency of clustering increased. Our data suggest that the relative importance of mechanisms determining phytoplankton metacommunity dynamics have changed along with environmental gradients shaping water column structure.

Three reference oxbow lakes were located in the White River National Wildlife Refuge (WRNWR), Arkansas and two impaired lakes, according to the US Environmental Agency Sect. 303 (d) Clean Water Act, were located in Mississippi. Surface sediment (top 5 cm) was collected at three sites within each lake and analyzed for 17 current and historic-use pesticides and metabolites. Chronic 28-day H. azteca sediment bioassays and pesticide body residue analyses were completed to determine the degree of biological responses and bioavailability. The greatest number of detectable pesticides in WRNWR and 303 (d) sediment samples was 9 and 12, respectively, with historic-use pesticide metabolite, p,p'-DDE [1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene] ubiquitous. No significant (p > 0.05) differences in animal survival were observed among sites. Animal growth was significantly (p < 0.05) less at only one site in a 303 (d)-listed lake (Macon Lake). Only six pesticides were observed in H. azteca with current-use pesticides detected at three sites; historic-use pesticides and metabolites detected at 11 sites. Animal body residues of a historic-use pesticide (dieldrin) and metabolite (p,p'-DDE) were associated with observed growth responses. Results show limited current-use pesticide contamination of sediments and H. azteca body tissues during autumn and that historic-use pesticides and metabolites are the primary contributors to observed biological responses.

The serious taste and odor (T&O) problems that raised from algal blooms have been widely studied. To supplement these studies, the types and concentrations of natural earthy-musty T&O compounds in the Taihu Lake were studied in September 2009, January 2010 and September 2010. In the first sampling period, beta-ionone and beta-cyclocitral were the major odorants, which changed to 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine (IPMP) and 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine (IBMP) in September 2010. The occurrence of T&Os was more significant in September (Autumn) than in January (Winter) in both the Zhushan Lake and Meiliang Bay, which are two important regions of the Taihu Lake. However, other regions showed more serious occurrence of T&Os, such as West Coast and South Coast, which was first reported based on the whole lake survey. The concentration of T&Os in the Zhushan Lake was much higher than that in the Meiliang Bay in both January 2010 and September 2010. The reason for the T&O occurrence is suggested by multivariate statistical methods, including principal component analysis and cluster analysis. It is confirmed that the T&O occurrence is more serious in the Taihu Lake due to unaccepted chemicals compared with other eutrophication lakes in China. The initial origins of T&O in the Taihu Lake are also confirmed, and several suggestions on how to control the earthy-musty T&O in lakes or drinking water treatment plants are provided.

JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												The Inner Tibetan Plateau (ITP; also called the Qiangtang Plateau) appears to have experienced an overall wetting in summer (June, July, and August) since the mid-1990s, which has caused the rapid expansion of thousands of lakes. In this study, changes in atmospheric circulations associated with the wetting process are analyzed for 1979-2018. These analyses show that the wetting is associated with simultaneously weakened westerlies over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The latter is further significantly correlated with the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) on interdecadal time scales. The AMO has been in a positive phase (warm anomaly of the North Atlantic Ocean sea surface) since the mid-1990s, which has led to both a northward shift and weakening of the subtropical westerly jet stream at 200 hPa near the TP through a wave train of cyclonic and anticyclonic anomalies over Eurasia. These anomalies are characterized by an anomalous anticyclone to the east of the ITP and an anomalous cyclone to the west of the ITP. The former weakens the westerly winds, trapping water vapor over the ITP while the latter facilitates water vapor intruding from the Arabian Sea into the ITP. Accordingly, summer precipitation over the ITP has increased since the mid-1990s.

The physical model is the unstructured grid, Finite-Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM). The biological model is a NPZD model, including phosphorus as the nutrient, which is the limiting element in Lake Michigan, phytoplankton, zooplankton and detritus. The models are driven by observed hourly meteorological forcing in 1998 and the model results are calibrated by satellite and in situ data. The main physical and ecological phenomena in the spring of 1998 are captured. During March to May, a circle-like phytoplankton bloom appears in southern Lake Michigan, which looks like a 'doughnut'. The formation mechanisms of the prolonged spring bloom are investigated. It is confirmed that the phytoplankton bloom is forced by rapidly increasing temperature and light intensity in spring. The thermal front that develops in spring inhibits the transport of nutrients and phytoplankton from the nearshore to the deeper water. The wind-driven gyre circulation in southern Lake Michigan induces significant offshore transport, which contributes to the establishment of the circular bloom.					; WANG, DongXiao/B-4445-2012; Schwab, David/B-7498-2012	Vanderploeg, Henry/0000-0003-1358-8475; Wang, Jia/0000-0003-4154-9721; 													2169-9275	2169-9291				OCT 13	2012	117								C10011	10.1029/2012JC008216	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2012JC008216													WOS:000309831800001

In addition, fish were eaten by YOY white bass, and Rotifera were consumed by YOY gizzard shad. Interspecies diet overlap indices, calculated to compare the food of the different species and to evaluate similarities, were usually highest for YOY white bass and YOY freshwater drum when compared with the other species and usually lowest between emerald shiners and all other forage fishes. Understanding the feeding interactions among fishes that could influence production at the forage-food level of the food web could provide insight into how cascading trophic interactions influence the production of piscivorous predators.																			0380-1330						1989	15	2					217	222		10.1016/S0380-1330(89)71477-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(89)71477-5													WOS:A1989AL80300005

While a total of 78 taxa were identified, Cosmarium became the main genus of the flora with 33 species. In the flora, the filamentous members of the Charophyta (12 species) were also noteworthy. Intraspecies variability is very high, with a Subspecies/Species index of 1.11, which reflects the sensitivity of the identified charophyte flora as an indicator of conservation efficiency. The physico-chemical analysis results and bioindicator species indicate that the investigated waters are fresh, with low salinity and a circumneutral or slightly alkaline pH, and are not organically polluted.

In this paper, the monitoring device was used to continuously monitor Dongting Lake for a period of 1 year, and the temperature distribution characteristics of the riparian hyporheic zone under seasonal variation were analysed. Ten riparian hydrothermal coupling models based on different soil thermal conductivity models were verified, and the optimal model was used to simulate the influence of the flood process on the temperature field and seepage field of the riparian hyporheic zone. The results show that the changes in groundwater level and temperature in the riparian hyporheic zone had obvious lag and attenuation phenomena compared with the changes in river water level and ambient temperature. The temperature field of the riparian hyporheic zone changed obviously in the year. The vertical temperature gradient was large in summer and winter, the stratification phenomenon was obvious, and the temperature field fluctuation was small. The effect of the flood process on the temperature field and seepage velocity in the riparian hyporheic zone was obviously hysteretic. The effect of the flood-withdrawing process on the temperature change of the shallow layer was greater than that of the flood-rising process, while the response of the deep layer temperature change to flood-rising and flood-withdrawing processes was the opposite. The effect of floods on the variation in groundwater velocity was that the flood-rising process was greater than the flood-withdrawing process.

Hydrogeological characterization of Dasht-e-Arjan Lake (Zagros Mountains, Iran): clarifying a long-time question	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Dasht-e-Arjan Lake is located in the southern Zagros mountain ranges of Iran. It is a tectonic karst polje, fed by a single spring plus local surface runoff, and drained by a single ponor. The fate of sinking water from the ponor had not been determined before this study. Previous investigations suggested two alternatives: (1) underground flow 24km southwest to Parishan Lake and/or springs in the Kazeron area, and (2) underground flow 20km southeast to springs at Domeasb Gorge. To clarify this question, an integrated hydrogeological study including a dye tracer test was undertaken. Comparison of the discharge into the Arjan ponor and the discharge of the Domeasb springs shows a reliable correlation. Further, annual water balance analysis reveals that the discharge at the Domeasb springs is too great for its topographic catchment, requiring a major additional source. The dye tracer test, using 5kg of uranine, was detected only at the Domeasb springs. Flow through time after the dye injection was 210h. The tracer breakthrough curves are very simple and sharp, with a clear peak concentration of 7ppb. The total tracer mass recovery and groundwater flow velocity were estimated to be 58% and 105mh(-1), respectively. The results indicate a simple and direct limestone karst hydraulic connection along the geologic strike between Dasht-e-Arjan Lake and the Domeasb springs. The results clearly suggest the possibility of designing a dam around the ponor to protect drying up the lake during drought periods.

Differences in behavior and distribution of permafrost-related lakes in Central Yakutia and their response to climatic drivers	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The Central Yakutian permafrost landscape is rapidly being modified by land use and global warming, but small-scale thermokarst process variability and hydrological conditions are poorly understood. We analyze lake-area changes and thaw subsidence of young thermokarst lakes on ice-complex deposits (yedoma lakes) in comparison to residual lakes in alas basins during the last 70 years for a local study site and we record regional lake size and distribution on different ice-rich permafrost terraces using satellite and historical airborne imagery. Statistical analysis of climatic and ground-temperature data identified driving factors of yedoma- and alas-lake changes. Overall, lake area is larger today than in 1944 but alas-lake levels have oscillated greatly over 70 years, with a mean alas-lake-radius change rate of 1.63.0 m/yr. Anthropogenic disturbance and forest degradation initiated, and climate forced rapid, continuous yedoma-lake growth. The mean yedoma lake-radius change rate equals 1.21.0 m/yr over the whole observation period. Mean thaw subsidence below yedoma lakes is 6.21.4 cm/yr. Multiple regression analysis suggests that winter precipitation, winter temperature, and active-layer properties are primary controllers of area changes in both lake types; summer weather and permafrost conditions additionally influence yedoma-lake growth rates. The main controlling factors of alas-lake changes are unclear due to larger catchment areas and subsurface hydrological conditions. Increasing thermokarst activity is currently linked to older terraces with higher ground-ice contents, but thermokarst activity will likely stay high and wet conditions will persist within the near future in Central Yakutian alas basins.					; IIJIMA, YOSHIHIRO/N-3237-2015; Fedorov, Alexander/K-2478-2016; Matthes, Heidrun/N-1833-2018; Ulrich, Mathias/R-1261-2019; Iijima, Yoshihiro/N-3237-2015; Schirrmeister, Lutz/O-5584-2015; Park, Hotaek/AAR-3006-2021	Fedorov, Alexander/0000-0002-4016-2149; IIJIMA, YOSHIHIRO/0000-0003-0590-5696; Matthes, Heidrun/0000-0001-9913-7696; Ulrich, Mathias/0000-0002-1337-252X; Schirrmeister, Lutz/0000-0001-9455-0596; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				FEB	2017	53	2					1167	1188		10.1002/2016WR019267	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016WR019267													WOS:000398568800010

A total of 1350 individuals and 37 species were collected. Throughout the study, the emergence patterns showed only minor variations regarding differences in particular habitats. During 2000 most species emerged in June, and in 2001 in May. The complete emergence period is shown for all collected species and studied in detail for abundant species. Excluding Allogamus uncatus, all abundant species emerged in summer, with most exhibiting a long emergence period. Rhyacophila fasciata had the longest emergence period in both years of the study and also showed winter activity. Trichopteran diversity and equitability were calculated and trophic relationships of the collected species were identified for each sampling site in order to obtain better insight into trichopteran community structure. Results indicated that the trichopteran community could be grouped according to travertine barriers and stream habitat types.

The palynological analysis demonstrated that the riverine wetland meadow from 12.1 to 9.8 cal. kyr BP changed to temperate deciduous broad-leaved forest in 9.8-2.8 cal. kyr BP. In addition, the cold climate from 12.1 to 9.8 cal. kyr BP became warmer from 8.5 to 7.3 cal. kyr BP. This was followed by another relatively cold period from 7.3 to 2.8 cal. kyr BP. The temperature change was mainly in response to solar factors. However, there are two relatively humid periods from 12.1 to 9.8 and 8.5 to 7.3 cal. kyr BP, which arose for different reasons. The earlier humid period resulted from strong westerlies and a rapidly rising sea level. The later humid period was produced mainly by the strong East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and may also be linked to La Nina-like activity. The cold 'Younger Dryas' event from 12.0 to 11.4 cal. kyr BP recorded in this study may have been produced by a North Atlantic meltwater pulse. This would have reduced temperatures that were already low because of weak insolation, and the strong winter monsoons would have increased the precipitation.					; LEE, Jin-Young/ITV-7438-2023; Yi, Sangheon/D-4780-2011; Song, Bing/AAA-9421-2020; YI, Sangheon/D-4780-2011	Lee, Jin-Young/0000-0002-4150-3910; Lee, Jin-Young/0000-0002-6941-5509; Song, Bing/0000-0002-8493-6273; Mao, Limi/0000-0002-0191-3042; ZHANG, Jinpeng/0000-0002-1669-7565; YI, Sangheon/0000-0002-2938-0380													0959-6836	1477-0911				JUN	2018	28	6					1011	1022		10.1177/0959683617752856	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683617752856													WOS:000436072100013
J	Sen, I; Gök, A				Sen, Ismail; Gok, Ali			Seasonal activity of adult leaf beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae, Orsodacnidae) occuring in Kovada Lake and Kizildag National Parks in Isparta Province (Turkey)	BIOLOGIA												Leaf beetles were studied in the Kovada Lake National Park (KL) and Kizildag National Park (KD) in Isparta province (Turkey) during April-October in 2009 and 2010. A total of 131 leaf beetle species were collected. In total, 88 species were detected from KL and 95 species from KD. Adult activity periods of the collected leaf beetle species were determined and their frequency and dominancy values were provided. The results showed slight differences in terms of the seasonal activity of the species in the two national parks. According to Shannon-Wiener index, the highest leaf beetle diversity among the studied months was found in early June (H': 4.23) and late May (H': 4.17). Sorensen similarity index of the species according to different seasonal periods showed three distinct seasonal periods: a) early April, b) late April to early July, c) late July to late October. Almost all leaf beetles showed a seasonal distribution, with the highest dominance during spring and early summer. The main reason for these different seasonal activities is that leaf beetle species are related to the quality and availability of host-plants.

J	Plug, I; Mitchell, P; Bailey, G				Plug, Ina; Mitchell, Peter; Bailey, Geoff			Late Holocene fishing strategies in southern Africa as seen from Likoaeng, highland Lesotho	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE												The open-air campsite of Likoaeng in the eastern highlands of Lesotho, southern Africa, preserves an extensive record of fishing activity by late Holocene hunter-gatherers. This paper reports the results of the analysis of the enormous fish assemblage recovered from its excavation. Fishing appears to have become more important from the start of the late Holocene neoglacial, c. 1000 cal. BC, with people camping at Likoaeng to intercept seasonal spawning runs of two species, Labeo capensis (the Orange River mudfish) and Labeobarbus aeneus (the smallmouth yellowfish). The latter dominates in the lower part of the sequence, with the former becoming dominant after 560 cal. BC. As a result, the focus of occupation probably shifted from high summer to spring. Estimates of Standard Length show that some fish were significantly larger than historically recorded maxima, but there is no sign that human predation affected fish size. The massive quantities of fish taken suggest that people may have used seasonally predictable spawning events as a focus for social aggregation. While there is no evidence for fish being preserved or removed off-site, the strong focus on fishing at Likoaeng strengthens the case for intensified hunter-gatherer interest in freshwater resources in southern Africa during the late Holocene.

Meanwhile, seasonal fluctuations in water levels and human exploitation of lake wetlands both affect the availability of food. Therefore, knowledge of the spatio-temporal dynamics of habitat utilization and adaptive behavior strategies can provide insights into how animals adapt to habitat changes in wetlands and has important conservation implications. In this study, we examined the effect of dynamic food resource supply on the spatial patterns, activity budget, and foraging strategy of Oriental Storks (Ciconia boyciana) at Shengjin Lake in China during a period where extensive fishing nets were present limiting the movement and dispersal of waterbirds ("pen culture period, PP" in 2017 winter) and a period after the removal of these pens during wetland restoration ("non-pen culture period, NPP" in 2018 winter). In comparing with the wintering storks in NPP, we demonstrated an overall loss of range and a significant reduction in population size in PP, which were probably due to habitat alteration and fragmentation triggered by pen culture. We reported that a higher overall time budget in foraging and locomotion and a comparatively lower in other behaviors with storks in PP. Net pens resulted in limited activity areas of the storks and a reduction in food availability due to habitat alteration and fragmentation, thus resulting in a more flexible and radical trend in the foraging patterns of the wintering storks was triggered by the combined effects of the net pens removal and habitat connectivity in NPP. Pen culture had resulted in a more conservative foraging strategy and a homogenization of behavioral composition for wintering storks at the lake. Our study highlighted the behavior-based results may provide key information to conceive management and conservation plans for wintering waterbirds.

The sampling started in spring before complete anoxia and was continued weekly until complete mixing of the water column occurred in autumn. Bacterial community patterns at 3 sampled depths (10, 12 and 14 m) were investigated using temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analyses. Results revealed changes in the structure of the bacterial communities as conditions changed from oxic to anoxic. Once anoxia had been reached, anaerobic bacterial communities continued to change and exhibited gradual successional patterns at the 3 depths. During the anoxic period, bacterial communities at 10 and 12 m were split into 2 groups corresponding to the steps 'until' and 'after' maximum stratification, which occurred on 19 August 2004. While the succession of the bacterial community in the hypolimnion was dynamic and exhibited gradual patterns at the 3 depths, a 'sensitivity gradient' to O-2 depletion was suggested: communities at 10 m appeared to be more affected by the shift in O-2 concentrations than those in deeper water layers.

Solar Lake benthic communities and their adaptation to the Lake's unique limnological cycle have not been described for over two decades. In this study, we revisit the flat mat and describe the summer's shallow water versus exposed microbial community; the latter occurs in response to the seasonal partial receding of water. We employed metagenomic NovaSeq-6000 shotgun sequencing and 16S rRNA, mcrA, and dsrB quantitative PCR. A total of 292 medium-to-high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were reconstructed. At the structural level, Candidatus Aenigmatarchaeota, Micrarchaeota, and Omnitrophota MAGs were exclusively detected in the shallow-water mats, whereas Halobacteria and Myxococcota MAGs were specific to the exposed microbial mat. Functionally, genes involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification and osmotic pressure were more abundant in the exposed than in the shallow-water microbial mats, whereas genes involved in sulfate reduction/oxidation and nitrogen fixation were ubiquitously detected. Genes involved in the utilization of methylated amines for methane production were predominant when compared with genes associated with alternative methanogenesis pathways. Solar Lake methanogen MAGs belonged to Methanosarcinia, Bathyarchaeia, Candidatus Methanofastidiosales, and Archaeoglobales. The latter had the genetic capacity for anaerobic methane oxidation. Moreover, Coleofasciculus chthonoplastes, previously reported to dominate the winter shallow-water flat mat, had a substantial presence in the summer. These findings reveal the taxonomic and biochemical microbial zonation of the exposed and shallow-water Solar Lake flat mat benthic community and their capacity to ecologically adapt to the summer water recession.IMPORTANCE Fifty-five years ago, the extremophilic "Solar Lake" was discovered on the Red Sea shores, garnering microbiologists' interest worldwide from the 1970s to 1990s. Nevertheless, research on the lake paused at the turn of the millennium. In our study, we revisited the Solar Lake benthic community using a genome-centric approach and described the distinct microbial communities in the exposed versus shallow-water mat unveiling microbial zonation in the benthic communities surrounding the Solar Lake. Our findings highlighted the unique structural and functional adaptations employed by these microbial mat communities. Moreover, we report new methanogens and phototrophs, including an intriguing methanogen from the Archaeoglobales family. We describe how the Solar Lake's flat mat microbial community adapts to stressors like oxygen intrusion and drought due to summer water level changes, which provides insights into the genomic strategies of microbial communities to cope with altered and extreme environmental conditions.

Factors provoking these changes are, therefore, of major importance. In Lake Erken in southeastern Sweden considerable changes in the timing and large variations in the composition of phytoplankton spring peaks have been observed during the past 45 yr. Here we show that long-term changes and variations in Lake Erken are strongly related to a single global parameter-the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Even regional parameters that are known to have most influence on the spring development of phytoplankton such as ice break-up and nutrient concentrations could not provide a more conclusive explanation of the observed changes in spring phytoplankton, making the NAO a very powerful and simple tool in determining the timing and composition of phytoplankton spring peaks in a temperate lake.

Here we present a multi-proxy (TOC, C/N, delta C-13, biogenic silica, and XRF elemental data) study of a 1.5 m sediment/peat sequence from Lake Pa Kho, northeast Thailand, which is supported by 20 AMS C-14 ages. Hydroclimatic reconstructions for Pa Kho suggest a strengthened summer monsoon between BC 170-AD 370, AD 800-960, and after AD 1450; and a weakening of the summer monsoon between AD 370-800, and AD 1300-1450. Increased run-off and a higher nutrient supply after AD 1700 can be linked to agricultural intensification and land-use changes in the region. This study fills an important gap in data coverage with respect to summer monsoon variability over Southeast Asia during the past 2000 years and enables the mean position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) to be inferred based on comparisons with other regional studies. Intervals of strengthened/weaker summer monsoon rainfall suggest that the mean position of the ITCZ was located as far north as 35 degrees N between BC 170-AD 370 and AD 800-960, whereas it likely did not reach above 17 degrees N during the drought intervals of AD 370-800 and AD 1300-1450. The spatial pattern of rainfall variation seems to have changed after AD 1450, when the inferred moisture history for Pa Kho indicates a more southerly location of the mean position of the summer ITCZ.					; Blaauw, Maarten/E-4539-2011; Löwemark, Ludvig/AEJ-2518-2022; Reimer, Paula/I-5915-2015; Chawchai, Sakonvan/GRF-2426-2022	Chawchai, Sakonvan/0000-0003-0527-9381; Reimer, Paula/0000-0001-9238-2146; Lowemark, Ludvig/0000-0002-3337-2367													0277-3791					MAR 1	2015	111						62	71		10.1016/j.quascirev.2015.01.007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2015.01.007													WOS:000353431100005

Human exploitation of lake wetlands alters the habitats of wintering waterbirds, and, in turn, waterbird diversity in the shallow lakes. In the present study, we surveyed species composition, abundance, and habitat characteristics of waterbirds in three types of wetland habitats (natural lakeside wetlands, paddy fields, and aquaculture ponds) at Caizi Lake, a shallow lake in the middle and lower Yangtze River during the wintering period, and investigated the effects of habitat change driven by human activity on the diversity of wintering waterbirds. There were significant differences in species composition and abundance among the three wetland habitats (natural lakeside wetlands, aquaculture ponds, and artificial paddy fields); however, there were no significant differences among the habitats with respect to the number of waterbirds. The numbers of overwintering waterbird species and waterbird individuals in aquaculture ponds and lakeside wetlands were significantly higher than the numbers in the paddy fields, indicating that wintering waterbirds prefer natural lake wetlands and aquaculture ponds. Principal component analysis of the three wetland habitat types revealed that factors influencing waterbird diversity include wetland area, vegetation cover, water level, and degree of human interference. Therefore, minimizing human interference and ensuring suitable habitats at specific periods could facilitate the maintenance of waterbird diversity.

J	Al-Mikhlafi, AS; Das, BK; Kaur, P				Al-Mikhlafi, AS; Das, BK; Kaur, P			Water chemistry of Mansar Lake (India): an indication of source area weathering and seasonal variability	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												The chemistry of major elements (Ca, Mg, Na, K and Si) and anions (HCO3, SO4 and Cl) in the water of Mansar Lake was studied, based on seasonal data. The results show that total dissolved solid (TDS) concentration in a particular season is similar, but varies slightly in different seasons with a variation factor of less than 2. This is because the collections were made in the dry seasons and the Ca-precipitation is the cause for the seasonal variability. The major element chemistry of Mansar Lake is mainly controlled by rock weathering, with HCO3 and Ca dominating the major ion composition because of the abundance of carbonate rocks in the basin. The results also indicate that the lake water is saturated with respect to calcite and/or dolomite during the spring season whereas it is undersaturated in the summer season. This contrast brings out seasonal variability. The lake shows disequilibrium with atmospheric CO2 as a result of carbonate dissolution in the drainage basin. The study also shows that physical weathering/erosion is dominant and that chemical weathering is incipient. This is consistent with the Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) data.

The Contamination Factor (CF) and geo-accumulation index (Igeo) indicated that the sediments in Gonghu Bay ranged from unpolluted to moderately polluted, except for Cd. The one-way ANOVA analysis results showed that the Pb, Zn, Cr, and Cu concentrations were higher at station 3 (lake inlet) and the Cr, Pb, and Zn concentrations were significantly higher in the spring. Additionally, using BCR's sequential extraction, the results showed that the fractionated metals Zn and Cd were observed as bioavailable fractions in the sediments, which could have potential moderate mobility in the water system. There was a significant increase in the bioavailable form during winter. The ratio of secondary and primary phrase (RSP) decreased according to the order Zn > Cu > Ni > Pb > Cd > Cr. Finally, these results indicated that the sediments of Gonghu Bay were polluted by Cd, Zn, and Cu, which provides a scientific basis for effectively protecting sediments in watershed areas from long-term heavy metal accumulation.

Attached bacteria constituted from 1% (in winter) to 30% (in summer) of the total cell counts obtained by epifluorescence. When biomass was calculated from counts and volumes measured in scanning electron micrographs, attached bacteria contributed up to 50% of the total biomass. Three indicators of bacterial activity were measured separately for attached and free-living bacteria: frequency of dividing cells (FDC), dark sulfate uptake and acetate uptake. Attached bacteria were bigger, had higher FDC and were responsible for most of the acetate uptake. Free-living bacteria were smaller with lower FDC and responsible for most of the sulfate uptake. Using this information and results from other studies, hydraulic flushing of the system, abundance of particles, sedimentation and feeding by zooplankton were considered to be the most important factors in regulating what percent of the bacterioplankton activities and biomass is due to attached bacteria in a given system.

Abiotic and biotic parameters were studied in a shallow lake, in which the island with the largest cormorants colony in north-eastern Poland is situated. We hypothesized that the strongest cyanobacterial blooms will persist near the cormorant's island and will decrease with an increasing distance from it. Filamentous cyanobacteria (Pseudanabaena, Planktolyngbya, Limnothrix, Planktothrix) were the main phytoplankton components during summer and autumn. Their strongest blooms (up to 66 mg L-1) were recorded near the roosting area. The content of nutrients and chlorophyll a, and the biomass of phytoplankton (primarily cyanobacteria) and zooplankton, decreased gradually with the increasing distance from the island. The changes from hypertrophic to eutrophic conditions were confirmed by a decrease in values of the trophic state index from 72 (site 1) to 58 (site 5). This all suggests that cormorants might have a significant impact on the deterioration of water quality (at distance to 1.6 km) and can contribute to faster water eutrophication. Our results suggest that protection of breeding sites for many waterbirds, such as cormorants, becomes a real threat for the functioning of aquatic ecosystems due to a large load of nutrients.

In this study, effects of ryegrass on double rice yield, N uptake and use efficiency were measured under different fertilizer N rates. A 3-year (2009-2011) field experiment arranged in a split-plot design was undertaken. Main plots were ryegrass (RG) as a winter cover crop and winter fallow (WF) without weed. Subplots were three N treatments for each rice season: 0 (N-0), 100 (N-100) and 200 kg N ha(-1) (N-200). In the 3-year experiment, RG reduced grain yield and plant N uptake for early rice (0.4-1.7 t ha(-1) for grain yield and 4.6-20.3 kg ha(-1) for N uptake) and double rice (0.6-2.0 t ha(-1) for grain yield and 6.3-27.0 kg ha(-1) for N uptake) when compared with WF among different N rates. Yield and N uptake decrease due to RG was smaller in N-100 and N-200 plots than in N-0 plots. The reduction in early rice grain yield in RG plots was associated with decrease number of panicles. Agronomic N use efficiency and fertilizer N recovery efficiency were higher in RG plots than winter fallow for early rice and double rice among different N rates and experimental years. RG tended to have little effect on grain yield, N uptake, agronomic N use efficiency, and fertilizer N recovery efficiency in the late rice season. These results suggest that ryegrass may reduce grain yield while it improves rice N use efficiency in a double rice cropping system.																			2095-3119						2016	15	11					2507	2514		10.1016/S2095-3119(16)61331-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(16)61331-X													WOS:000388159000008

Although sediment microorganisms have been found to mediate the nutrient cycle in wetlands, the role of epiphytic bacteria on submerged S. alterniflora has rarely drawn attention. In the present study, we analyzed the characteristics of epiphytic microbial community diversity and functional properties related to S. alterniflora in summer and winter by Illumina MiSeq sequencing and functional prediction. Marked high abundances of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota, Planctomycetota, Cyanobacteria and Desulfobacterota were found in S. alterniflora epiphytic microbiome. Beta diversity based on NMDS and LDA analysis revealed that the distribution of these epiphytic microbial communities clustered according to the leaf locations and variation in seasons. Environmental factors, including temperature, salinity, DO and total organic matter, exert important roles in impacting the microbial community. Significantly higher abundances of chemoheterotrophy, aerobic_chemoheterotrophy, hydrocarbon degradation, fermentation, nitrate reduction and nitrate respiration were correlated with the submerged S. alterniflora epiphytic microbiome. Collectively, the results indicated that S. alterniflora epiphytic bacterial community diversity and functional guilds varied greatly with variations in leaf locations and seasons. These results will also provide guidance for the isolation of functional bacteria in controlling plant spread.																				2077-1312				DEC	2022	10	12							1981	10.3390/jmse10121981	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jmse10121981													WOS:000902531400001

Four genera, Mallomonas and Synura (Mallomonadaceae), and Paraphysomonas and Spiniferomonas (Paraphysomonadaceae), were represented. The four species of Spiniferomonas, along with 11 species and one form in the other three genera, are reported for the first time. All the species found have distributions that are cosmopolitan or nearly so. A total of 42 species in three genera of Mallomonadaceae and two genera of Paraphysomonadaceae are now known in New Zealand. The flora consists both of cosmopolitan species and those so far known only from New Zealand, and probably is still significantly under-represented.

The taxonomy of its diatom flora is poorly documented, although diatoms are recognized as important indicators of the environment. From July 2004 to May 2006, the diatom flora of the Da'erbin Lake habitats and its surrounding bogs was investigated. Collections were made at an altitude of 1288-1310 m from habitats with pH values between 4.3-10.2. Eunotia was one of the dominant genera in this area and had high diversity (28 taxa). The composition of the Eunotia assemblages differed among the habitats and seasons surveyed in this study. Some species were found in all habitats whereas others seemed to be restricted to one habitat. The maximum diversity was found in the bog habitats during summer while the minimum was found in material collected in the lake during spring. Both acidobiontic and acidophilous taxa were observed. Taxonomic descriptions and ecological affinities are provided and compared to reports in the literature.

Approximately 170 x 10(6) kg of salt appear to be added to Seneca Lake from within the basin each year. The region is underlain by Silurian beds of commercial-grade rock salt similar to 450-600 m below the surface. It has been proposed that Seneca and Cayuga Lakes are saltier than the others because their basins intersect some of these beds. Fieldwork supports this hypothesis. A deep water mass up to 10% saltier than the rest of Seneca Lake was observed to expand and partially fill the hypolimnion from the bottom up during summer 1991 and 1992. The saltier water was mixed into the rest of the lake in early winter, only to reappear after the thermocline was established. Sediment interstitial water profiles in both lakes reveal large regions of saline groundwater several meters below the sediment surface, and NaCl concentrations as high as 30 parts per thousand have been found.

Air temperatures have been increasing over the past 50 years in southwestern Alaska, affecting the growth and population dynamics of many organisms, including a variety of aquatic species such as the freshwater mussel Anodonta beringiana. 3. We collected freshwater mussels from Iliamna Lake, in the Bristol Bay region of Alaska, and measured their shells to examine climatic effects on growth patterns. 4. Linear mixed effects models and ordinary least square linear regressions revealed strong positive correlations between local air temperatures (especially in May, October and the summer months) and inter-annual variation in mussel growth. Slower mussel growth was also significantly correlated with later date of ice break-up, which was linked to air temperatures in late spring.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				NOV	2010	55	11					2339	2346		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02447.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02447.x													WOS:000282698800010

Triplicate samples, averaging 22 liters, were collected in each time period (approximately 6 weeks) and analyzed for .alpha.-BHC, lindane, heptachlor epoxide, dieldrin, endrin, DDT residues, methoxychlor, polychlorinated biphenyls and hexachlorobenzene. .alpha.- and .delta.-chlordane, mirex and toxaphene were also investigated but were not found in any of the samples. Concentrations of these compounds ranged from 0.01 to 65 ng/L. The east side of the lake received considerably lower concentrations in rainfall (on average, roughly 65% less) and the levels of most of the observed substances were higher at both locations in the spring and early summer. Estimates of direct loadings to the lake were made using volume-weighted concentrations. The highest was for .alpha.-BHC at 860 kg/year and the lowest for hexachlorobenzene at 3.7 kg/year; the loading estimate for polychlorinated biphenyls was 300 kg/year.																			0730-7268	1552-8618					1985	4	5					677	683		10.1897/1552-8618(1985)4[677:OSITRO]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1897/1552-8618(1985)4[677:OSITRO]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1985ARW2300011
J	Lee, MR; Daly, L; Floyd, C; Martin, PE				Lee, Martin R.; Daly, Luke; Floyd, Cameron; Martin, Pierre-Etienne			CM carbonaceous chondrite falls and their terrestrial alteration	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												The CM carbonaceous chondrites provide unique insights into the composition of the protoplanetary disk, and the accretion and geological history of their parent C-complex asteroid(s). Of the hundreds of CMs that are available for study, the majority are finds and so may have been compromised by terrestrial weathering. Nineteen falls have been recovered between 1838 and 2020, and there is a hint of two temporal clusters: 1930-1942 and 2009-2020. Falls are considered preferable to finds to study because they should be near pristine, and here this assumption is tested by investigating their susceptibility to alteration before recovery and during curation. CMs falling on the land surface are prone to contamination by organic compounds from soil and vegetation. Where exposed to liquid water prior to collection, minerals including oldhamite can be dissolved and most fluid mobile elements leached. Within days of recovery, CMs adsorb water from the atmosphere and are commonly contaminated by airborne hydrocarbons. Interaction with atmospheric water and oxygen during curation over year to decadal timescales can produce Fe-oxyhydroxides from Fe,Ni metal and gypsum from indigenous gypsum and oldhamite. Relationships between the petrologic (sub)types of pre-1970 falls and their terrestrial age could be due to extensive but cryptic alteration during curation, but are more likely a sampling bias. The terrestrial history of a CM fall, including circumstances of its collection and conditions of its curation, must be taken into account before it is used to infer processes on C-complex parent bodies such as Ryugu and Bennu.					; Lee, Martin/D-9169-2011	Floyd, Cameron/0000-0001-5986-491X; Daly, Luke/0000-0002-7150-4092; Martin, Pierre-Etienne/0000-0003-1848-9695; Lee, Martin/0000-0002-6004-3622													1086-9379	1945-5100				JAN	2021	56	1					34	48		10.1111/maps.13607	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.13607		JAN 2021											WOS:000608224300001

Understanding how this region evolved in the past offers valuable insights for understanding future climate trends. Despite many efforts, the evolution of moisture and aeolian activity during the Holocene in the southern TP remains controversial, in part due to the complex topography and regional atmospheric circulation. In addition, constructing a sound chronology for aeolian sediments using radiocarbon is challenging. Here we use the low-temperature organic carbon fraction from a sediment profile from the middle reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo, southern TP. We reconstructed a Holocene history of humidity and dust using grain size, magnetic susceptibility, and organic matter as climate proxies. The reconstructed history features three distinct stages. During the early Holocene (11.7-8.3 ka B & sdot;P), the climate was humid with weak dust activity, under the influence of the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). But during 8.3-5.8 ka B & sdot;P, moisture was also influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Diminished solar activity led to a negative NAO phase, intensifying aeolian activity. From 5.8 ka B & sdot;P onward, enhanced winter insolation and stronger mid-latitude westerlies (MLW) contributed to a renewed warm and humid climate. This study provided an insight in which to view the interplay of Holocene climatic systems and environmental change in the southern TP.

We aim to determine whether the current coupling of high summer temperatures and low water tables of peatlands in northern Poland is recent or has been stable over long timescales, and to infer the climatic context driving past relationships between temperature and peatland hydrology. We compare the previously published 4000-year long paleohydrological record from Kusowo bog with a new chironomid-based summer temperature record covering the last 4.5 ka from nearby (-7 km) Lake Spore. Although several simultaneous shifts in our hydrological and temperature reconstructions are evident on multi-decadal to centennial timescales, for instance during the peak cooling of the Migration Period or Little Ice Age (-1.4 and 0.4 cal ka, respectively), the records reveal mostly independent fluctuations. However, the relatively high uncertainty of our quantitative estimates suggests caution is warranted when inferring the strength of the relationship between the reconstructed variables at this temporal resolution. However, at centennial to millennial timescales, the relationship between the records is surprisingly strong. Overall, warmer summers (mean July temperature = 18.7 degrees C) before -2.3 cal. ka corresponded well with lower ground water tables at Kusowo bog (mean = 11.2 cm), whereas cooler summers in the following period (mean = 17.4 degrees C) were accompanied by higher water tables (mean = 7.9 cm). Particularly wet bog conditions during the last -0.7 ka were also the coldest. The finding that on long timescales the drying of Kusowo bog coincided with warming suggests a persistent regional climate pattern in which drought conditions change along with summer temperatures. If this millennial-scale pattern holds for the projected warming, further peatland drying can be expected in northern Poland.

The HY06 annual precipitation in the state of Oklahoma, as observed by the Oklahoma Mesonet, is around 61% of the normal (92.84 cm, based on the 1921-2008 climatology), which results in HY06 as the second-driest year in the record. In particular, the total precipitation during the winter of 2005-2006 is only 27% of the normal, and this winter ranks as the driest season. On the other hand, the HY07 annual precipitation amount is 121% of the normal, and HY07 ranks as the seventh-wettest year for the entire state and the wettest year for the central region of the state. Summer 2007 is the second-wettest season for the state. Large-scale dynamics play a key role in these extreme events. During the extreme dry period (11/2005-02/2006), a dipole pattern in the 500 hPa geopotential height anomaly existed where an anomalous high was over the southwestern U.S. region and an anomalous low was over the Great Lakes. This pattern is associated with inhibited moisture transport from the Gulf of Mexico and strong sinking motion over the SGP, both contributing to the extreme dryness. The precipitation deficit over the SGP during the extreme dry period is clearly linked to significantly suppressed cyclonic activity over the southwestern United States, which shows a robust relationship with the western Pacific teleconnection pattern. The precipitation events during the extreme wet period (May-July 2007) were initially generated by active synoptic weather patterns, linked with moisture transport from the Gulf of Mexico by the northward low-level jet, and enhanced the frequency of thunderstorms and their associated latent heat release. Although the drought and pluvial conditions are dominated by large-scale dynamic patterns, we have found two possible positive feedback processes during the extreme dry and wet periods in this study that play key certain roles to maintain and reinforce the length and severity of existing drought and flood events. For example, during the extreme dry period, with less clouds, liquid water path, precipitable water vapor, precipitation, and thinner Cu cloud thickness, more net radiation was absorbed and used to evaporate water from the ground. The evaporated moisture, however, was removed by low-level divergence. Thus, with less precipitation and removed atmospheric moisture, more absorbed incoming solar radiation was used to increase surface temperature and to make the ground drier.					; L'Ecuyer, Tristan/E-5607-2012; Houser, Paul/J-9515-2013; Entin, Jared/MVU-4184-2025; Deng, Yi/K-6664-2012; HSU, KUOLIN/E-6120-2019; Feng, Zhe/E-1877-2015; Xi, Baike/AAP-9896-2021; Hsu, Kuolin/E-6120-2019; Dong, Xiquan/C-5959-2016	Xi, Baike/0000-0001-6126-2010; L'Ecuyer, Tristan/0000-0002-7584-4836; Houser, Paul/0000-0002-2991-0441; HSU, KUOLIN/0000-0002-3578-3565; Deng, Yi/0000-0003-0659-2767; Feng, Zhe/0000-0002-7540-9017; Dong, Xiquan/0000-0002-3359-6117													2169-897X					FEB 4	2011	116								D03204	10.1029/2010JD014776	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2010JD014776													WOS:000287030000001
J	Cook, KH; Vizy, EK				Cook, Kerry H.; Vizy, Edward K.			Understanding the regionality and diurnal cycles of precipitation in the Lake Victoria Basin during Boreal fall	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												The diurnal cycle of rainfall in the Lake Victoria Basin of East Africa results from the super positioning of regional circulations driven by lake/land temperature differences and topography in the presence of the large-scale flow. Analysis of a triple-nested regional model simulation with a convective-permitting inner domain shows how these elements combine to produce the observed regionality of precipitation, including diurnal cycling, in boreal fall. A single diurnal rainfall peak occurs throughout the basin, but the time of maximum rainfall varies within the basin. The rainy period over the lake begins with precipitation over the northern part of the lake near 02Z (0500 LT), so it is not simply nighttime rain driven by lake/land breezes. Onset of the rainy period occurs only when low geopotential heights over the relatively warm lake cause a southward branch of the Turkana Jet to form. The formation of the jet depends on nighttime cooling over the Eastern Rift Mountains, which acts to direct the large-scale, moist flow around the topography. Topography also plays a role in the daytime rainy period over land in the Lake Victoria Basin. Moist divergence over the lake supports convergence and precipitation over the shore regions. Precipitation rates are twice the magnitude over the eastern shore compared with the western shore because daytime warming of the high elevations of the Eastern Rift Mountains allows the large-scale easterly flow to go over the mountains. This easterly flow converges with the lake/land circulation and doubles precipitation rates over the eastern shore.

Field works included measurement of the ice and snow cover thickness of seven lakes situated in the Tatra Mountains (UNESCO biosphere reserve) at the beginning and the end of the 2017/2018 winter season. In addition, morphometric, topographic and daily meteorological data of lakes from local IMGW (Polish Institute of Meteorology and Water Management) stations and satellite images were used. The obtained results enabled us to quantify the impact of the winter eolian snow accumulation on the variation in ice thickness. This variation was ranging from several centimetres up to about 2 meters and had a tendency to increase during the winter season. The thickest ice covers occurred in the most shaded places in the direct vicinity of rock walls. The obtained results confirm a dominating role of the snow cover in the variation of the ice thickness within individual lakes.

J	An, KG				An, KG			Longitudinal and seasonal variations of epilimnetic silica in a morphologically complex reservoir and the significance of flow regime and internal processes to their dynamics.	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Spatial and temporal dynamics of silica (SiO2) were examined in a morphologically complex reservoir, based on data collected between high-flow year and low-flow year. SiO2 averaged 3.4 mg/L and varied from 0.1 to 9.7 mg/L depending on the year,and the location. The paired sample test of SiO2 showed that in mainstem sites, SiO2 was significantly (t = 3.577, p < 0.01) greater in the high-flow year than in the low-flow year, and this pattern was similar to that of embayment sites, indicating an importance of flow regime on the silica loading. During the high-flow year, SiO2 was significantly (t = 3.577, p < 0.01) greater in the mainstems than in the embayments, but during the low-flow year, there was no statistical difference between the two reaches. SiO2 showed a distinct longitudinal decline from the headwaters to the dam in the high-flow year, and it was modified by the plunging of metalimnetic density current in the mid-lake reach. Seasonal fluctuation of SiO2 was influenced by; internal nutrient cycling and diatom populations. Dominant phytoplankton abundance had an inverse relation between the two algal populations of bluegreens and diatoms during August-December of the low-flow year. In other words, bluegreen algae dominated at the low SiO2 (< 5 mg/L) during the summer period of the low-flow year, whereas diatoms dominated with the increase of SiO2 in fall overturn. Overall results suggest that increase of silica in this system is primarily regulated by interannual flow regime, but the internal loading during fall overturn and biological up-take by seasonal growth of diatom community were also considered as an important process controlling the input of silica.

Here we present a new multi-proxy sedimentary dataset from the Heihe River basin in the middle part of the Hexi Corridor on the northern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), which is a sensitive zone for the interaction between the westerlies and AM. Fluctuations in grain size, & delta;C-13(org), & delta;O-18, magnetic susceptibility, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and C/N ratio document regional lake and climate evolution since 5334 cal yr BP. Results show that climate conditions on the millennial timescale are humid in the late Middle Holocene (MH) and dry to wet in the Late Holocene (LH). Combined with the multi-model ensemble simulation from PMIP3-CMIP5, high lake levels and wetter climate in the late MH are closely linked to the strengthening Asian summer monsoon. Simultaneously, the slight wetting trend since the late LH may be the superimposing effect of enhanced westerlies and the weakening Asian winter monsoon. These findings can provide insights into the interpretation of the interaction between the westerlies and AM during the Holocene in East Asia.																			0033-5894	1096-0287				NOV	2023	116						30	45	PII S0033589423000376	10.1017/qua.2023.37	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/qua.2023.37		JUL 2023											WOS:001029268900001

A section of US highway 97 and Oregon highway 140 along the east and west shores of Upper Klamath Lake north of Klamath Falls, Oregon, were evaluated as part of an earthquake hazard mitigation project for Klamath County. Site investigations reveal that rocks exposed along the steep slopes are predominantly Pliocene and Miocene basalt flows and vent deposits. The rocks are intensely weathered and fractured. The slope angle varies from 5 degrees to 43 degrees with the heights ranging from 100 to 500 m. Seismic slope stability was evaluated based on slope angle and rock properties utilizing the GIS tools, MapInfo(TM) and Vertical Mapper(TM). The results show that some sections of slopes along US highway 97 and Oregon highway 140 in the study area have extremely high susceptibility to earthquake-induced rock falls and slides. A moderate earthquake, like the 1993 Klamath Falls earthquake (M6.0), is likely to trigger additional rock falls and slides along US highway 97 and Oregon highway 140 in the area.																					0-7844-0449-6				1999		16					61	70																WOS:000086275400007

Shallow lakes freeze to the bed, thus preventing permafrost thaw underneath them and limiting the length of the period with greenhouse gas production in the unfrozen lake sediments. Radar remote sensing permits to distinguish lakes with bedfast ice due to the difference in backscatter intensities from bedfast and floating ice. This study investigates the potential of a unique time series of three-year repeat-pass TerraSAR-X (TSX) imagery with high temporal (11 days) and spatial (10 m) resolution for monitoring bedfast ice as well as ice phenology of lakes in the zone of continuous permafrost in the Lena River Delta, Siberia. TSX backscatter intensity is shown to be an excellent tool for monitoring floating versus bedfast lake ice as well as ice phenology. TSX-derived timing of ice grounding and the ice growth model CLIMo are used to retrieve the ice thicknesses of the bedfast ice at points where in situ ice thickness measurements were available. Comparison shows good agreement in the year of field measurements. Additionally, for the first time, an 11-day sequential interferometric coherence time series is analyzed as a supplementary approach for the bedfast ice monitoring. The coherence time series detects most of the ice grounding as well as spring snow/ice melt onset. Overall, the results show the great value of TSX time series for monitoring Arctic lake ice and provide a basis for various applications: for instance, derivation of shallow lakes bathymetry, evaluation of winter water resources and locating fish winter habitat as well as estimation of taliks extent in permafrost.

J	Johnston, BR; Jacoby, JM				Johnston, BR; Jacoby, JM			Cyanobacterial toxicity and migration in a mesotrophic lake in western Washington, USA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In fall 1997, the toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa was documented in Lake Sammamish (western Washington, U. S. A.) for the first time. Cyanobacterial activity and environmental conditions that may promote toxic cyanobacteria were investigated during summer and fall 1999. Development of toxic Microcystis was hypothesized to be due to runoff of nutrients from the watershed (external loading hypothesis) or from vertical migration of dormant cyanobacteria from the nutrient-rich sediments into the water column (cyanobacterial migration hypothesis). Microcystins were detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay during late August and early September 1999 despite low cyanobacterial abundance. Microcystin concentrations ranged between 0.19-3.8 mug l(-1) throughout the lake and at all depths with the exception of the boat launch where concentrations reached 43 mug l(-1). Comparison of the conditions associated with the toxic episodes in 1997 and 1999 indicate that Microcystis is associated with a stable water column, increased surface total phosphorus concentrations (> 10 mug l(-1)), surface temperatures greater than 22 degreesC, high total nitrogen to phosphorus ratios (> 30), and increased water column transparency (up to similar to5.5 m). Migration of the cyanobacteria, Microcystis and Anabaena, occurred in both the deep and shallow portions of the lake. Microcystis dominated (89-99%) the migrating cyanobacteria with greater migration from the shallow station. External loading of nutrients due to the large rainfall preceding the 1997 toxic episode may have provided the nutrients needed to fuel that bloom. However, toxic Microcystis occurred in 1999 despite the lack of rain and subsequent external runoff. The migration of Microcystis from the nutrient-rich sediments may have been the inoculum for the toxic population detected in 1999.																			0018-8158					MAR	2003	495	1-3					79	91		10.1023/A:1025496922050	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1025496922050													WOS:000184989300008
J	ADALSTEINSSON, H; JONASSON, PM; RIST, S				ADALSTEINSSON, H; JONASSON, PM; RIST, S			PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THINGVALLAVATN, ICELAND	OIKOS												The basin of subarctic Thingvallavatn (64-degrees 10'N, 21-degrees 10'W) was originally formed by tectonic subsidence and glacial erosion. Since the glacial recession some 10,000 yr ago, the basin has been strongly modified by volcanic activity. The catchment area is characterized by lava flows, of which four entered the lake, and one dammed it. One eruption occurred within the lake. Fault movements have resulted in horizontal and vertical displacements. The lake, area 83 km2, is at 100.5 m a.s.l. It has a mean depth of 34 m, and a maximum of 114 m. The catchment area is 1000 km2, of which ca. 50% is postglacial lava. Interglacial lavas and subglacially formed mountains rising to 800-1100 m, glaciers and glacial deposits account for another 50%. The mean discharge of the last 50 yr is 100 m3 S-1. The precipitation, estimated at 2000-2500 mm yr-1, is mostly percolated; hence the lake is ca. 90% spring-fed. The main spring areas in the N show a constant temperature of 2.8-3.5-degrees-C. Warmer ground water (7.5-10.7-degrees-C) enters the lake in the SW owing to the nearby Hengill geothermal area. A discrepancy between potential water balance and discharge is explained by an underestimate of the amount of precipitation in the mountainous areas, by evapotranspiration and underground flow from the Langjokull glacier bed from outside the topographic catchment area. The water level has been regulated since 1960, and the pattern of water level fluctuations before and after are discussed. Irradiance (PAR) measurements since 1982 reveal strong diel fluctuations and a reflection of 49% from the lake surface. Values from PAR measurements and global radiation estimates show fairly consistent results. The euphotic layer varies between 20 m in spring to 40 m in summer. Temperature measurements cover 30 yr. The lake is dimictic and the temperature commonly reaches 10-11-degrees-C in August with a gradient of 2-3-degrees-C over the thermocline. On an average, the ice-cover tasted 95 d during the period 1974 to 1990.																			0030-1299					MAY-JUN	1992	64	1-2					121	135		10.2307/3545048	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3545048													WOS:A1992JG50900011

Based on sediment recovered, Stonehouse Meadow was either absent or severely restricted in size at similar to 8000 cal yr BR Beginning similar to 7500 cal yr BP, the meadow became established and persisted to similar to 3000 cal yr BP when it began to dry. Comparison of the timing of this late Holocene drought record to multiple records extending from the eastern Sierra Nevada across the central Great Basin to the Great Salt Lake support the interpretation that this dry period was regional. The beginning and ending dates vary among sites, but all sites record multiple centuries of dry climate between 2500 and 1900 cal yr BP. This duration makes it the longest persistent dry period within the late Holocene. In contrast, sites in the northern Great Basin record either no clear evidence of drought, or have wetter than average climate during this period, suggesting that the northern boundary between wet and dry climates may have been between about 40 degrees and 42 degrees N latitude. This dry in the southwest and wet in the northwest precipitation pattern across the Great Basin is supported by large-scale spatial climate pattern hypotheses involving ENSO, PDO, AMO, and the position of the Aleutian Low and North Pacific High, particularly during winter.

Diffusive transport continuously supplied methylmercury to the epilimnion under summer stratification, while fall mixing resulted in a pulsed release of methylmercury to the upper mixed waters. These processes were the main internal sources of methylmercury to the epilimnion, and together almost equaled the total external supply. The wind-driven entrainment represented an additional stochastic internal supply of methylmercury of approximately 9% in 2006. Considering more than 15 years of data, we estimate 1.8 wind-driven events occur per year. The mass of methylmercury inputs to the epilimnion exceeded the measured increase, suggesting that loss processes are important in regulating methylmercury accumulation. The relative contribution of internal sources of methylmercury to the epilimnion has decreased in recent years, shifting the importance to the external inputs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Hydrophysical aspects of oxygen regime formation in a shallow ice-covered lake	WATER RESOURCES												Long-term observational data on a small, shallow Lake Vendyurskoe (Karelia) were used to analyze the space and time dissolved-oxygen dynamics in winter. Biochemical consumption was found to play a leading role in the reduction of dissolved-oxygen concentration in lake water in winter. The total decrease in the amount of dissolved oxygen since the beginning of under-ice period until mid-April was shown to amount to one third of the initial value. The year-to-year variations in winter oxygen consumption are similar to 10%, suggesting the process to be stable in the years of observations. The rate of oxygen consumption and variations in dissolved oxygen content of lake water in winter were evaluated. The analysis and literary data allow us to conclude that the hydrophysical processes taking place in shallow lakes in winter have a considerable effect on their oxygen regime.					; Zdorovennova, Galina/L-8214-2013; Potakhin, Maksim/AAG-2533-2019; Zdorovennov, Roman/L-8294-2013; Terzhevik, Arkady/L-7911-2013; Palshin, Nikolay/L-8634-2013	Potakhin, Maksim/0000-0002-2630-2176; Zdorovennova, Galina/0000-0003-2726-0104; Palshin, Nikolay/0000-0003-1540-3788; Zdorovennov, Roman/0000-0003-1695-4872; Terzhevik, Arkady/0000-0002-0837-9065; 													0097-8078	1608-344X				SEP	2010	37	5					662	673		10.1134/S0097807810050064	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0097807810050064													WOS:000282168300006

To evaluate the effects of nutrient reduction on phytoplankton, long-term monitoring data for Lake Wuli from 1998 to 2017 were analyzed. After the restoration since 2003, nitrogen decreased significantly from 8 to 2 mg/l until 2008 and then remained stable until 2017, while total phosphorus declined progressively from 0.2 mg/l to approximately 0.08 mg/l during 2003 and 2017. Biological data indicated that phytoplankton biovolume decreased after restoration until 2010 and then increased slightly from 2010 to 2017, mainly due to increasing of cyanobacterial biovolume. The dominant taxa shifted from cryptophyta to cyanobacteria since 2009. The results of both nonmetric multidimensional scaling and random forest regression showed that changes in nutrients, especially decreases in nitrogen, were the main drivers for phytoplankton community variation and increasing of cyanobacterial biovolume to the total phytoplankton biovolume ratio in summer and autumn. In addition to nutrients reduction, climatic variables such as wind speed decrease also played vital roles in increasing of cyanobacterial dominance in Lake Wuli. Our study confirmed that phytoplankton community respond strongly to nitrogen reduction in the subtropics and that climate change mediates the response.

J	Auer, MT; Gatzke, TL				Auer, MT; Gatzke, TL			The spring runoff event, thermal bar formation, and cross margin transport in Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Retention of materials delivered during the spring runoff event in the nearshore is mediated by physical phenomena such as the thermal bar. Here we investigate the timing of the runoff event vis-a-vis formation of the thermal bar and quantify its impact on the fate of materials of terrestrial origin (TSS, total suspended solids) in the nearshore waters of Lake Superior. It was estimated that the spring runoff event delivers an average of 70% of the annual TSS load for a 33-year period of record (1966-1998). The average dates for the midpoint of the spring runoff event and thermal bar formation are 9 April (range, mid-March to late April) and 2 May (range, early April to late May), respectively. This offset of 3-4 weeks provides an opportunity for materials which are discharged and retained in suspension by wave action to be transported from the nearshore before trapping by the thermal bar can occur. Model calculations indicate that 23 +/- 28% (range < 1% to > 99%) of the spring runoff event TSS loading remains available for trapping at the time of thermal bar formation. In terms of mass, predicted retention varied from negligible amounts to in excess of 700,000 metric tons. The spring runoff event is predicted to have the potential to raise average nearshore TSS levels more than 4.1 +/- 2.7 times above background levels and to sustain that elevation for more than 60 days. The range in the nearshore TSS response reflects interannual variability in the magnitude of the spring runoff event and its timing relative to the formation of the thermal bar.																			0380-1330						2004	30			1			64	81		10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70378-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70378-0													WOS:000227991500006

The cultural assemblages include an early MSA dated broadly to 279,000 +/- 47,000 years, a highly retouched form of MSA at 157,000 +/- 21,000 years and a minimally retouched, expedient MSA assemblage from a series of occupation horizons at 121,000 +/- 6,000 years. The latter represents multiple brief visits to a hunting and butchery site on the edge of an active spring pool, where periodic sedimentation gently buried occupation debris in a near-pristine context. Periods of lower spring discharge are represented by organic horizons as swampy vegetation encroached on the springs, while periods of higher spring discharge created pools. Overall, the spring sequence indicates low-energy subaqueous environments similar to lakes, ponds or backwater sites. The sequence is characterized by fine sands, silts and clays responsible for the good archaeological preservation.

THERMAL AND PHYSICAL FACETS OF CLIMATE FOR RECREATION AND SPORTING ACTIVITIES IN THE JEWISH AUTONOMOUS REGION IN THE RUSSIAN FAR EAST	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL												Weather and climate constitute the natural resource-base of a place for recreation and tourism. Climatic resources are an important condition for development of tourist activity and represent meteorological elements or their combinations which have medical and biological properties and are used in recreation. The relationship between the atmospheric environment and the enjoyable pursuit of outdoor recreational activity is a function of three facets of climatic conditions. Some climate variables are entirely physical (e.g., rain and its duration, high wind), some are physiological or thermal (e.g., air temperature and thermal state of the human body), some are psychological or aesthetic (e.g., clear blue sky, bright day or visibility). Thermal qualities of climate along with physical facets such as wind, rain and snow are important determinants of the suitability of weather and climate for outdoor recreation and sporting activities. The central objective of this paper is to present the possibility of assessment of climate physical facets for sport recreation taking into account the impact of climatic factors on the thermal state of a human body in the Jewish Autonomous Region ( JAR). Period favorable for summer recreation is insignificant and makes only a half of the duration of the warm season as a whole everywhere in the region. Limiting factors are dry or sultry weather, heavy precipitation and uncomfortable air temperatures at the beginning and at the end of the warm season. Mountain area is more acceptable for summer recreation with less sultry days and stronger wind. Data on water temperature in rivers and lakes corrects the results on the duration of the period favorable for beach recreation. In winter, the period unfavorable for outdoor recreation lasts from the middle of December to the middle - end of January, longer in mountains. Snow cover and its depth are important characteristics of physical facets for skiing and mountain-skiing tourism. Steady snow cover is formed from the second or third decade of November till the second - third decade of March. Extremely cold temperature and insufficient snow cover limit recreational and sporting activity in winter alongside with strong wind of more than 7 - 8 m/s. As a whole, the results show that conditions vary spatially and temporally through the region with two recreational-climatic zones. In some cases, markedly favorable periods are short; in others the periods are more persistent. A scheme that integrates important weather variables is used to assess the nature and duration of periods of favorable conditions for recreational and sporting activities. The work is considered useful for identifying recreational land use potential and could be valuable in planning and related decision-making in the tourism sector.

Poyang Lake, an open freshwater lake in China, and the extensive floodplain wetland surrounding the lake, plays an important role in protecting the biodiversity of this internationally recognized wetland system. This paper is the first field-based study into an investigation of the groundwater dynamics in the floodplain wetland and the associated hydraulic relationship with the lake using hydrological, hydrochemical and stable isotope evidence, as exemplified by Poyang Lake wetland. Results show that groundwater stores within the floodplain wetland exhibit spatial and temporal variability in terms of the magnitudes of groundwater level variations. Floodplain groundwater fluctuations largely reflect patterns of the precipitation and the lake water level; however, the groundwater dynamics are highly affected by the variations in the lake water level, rather than local precipitation. Floodplain wetland is most likely to receive the lake water during spring and summer and may recharge the lake during periods of low lake water level. Additionally, floodplain groundwater displays similar hydrochemical and environmental isotope signatures to that of the lake at different sampling periods, indicating a close hydraulic relationship between groundwater and the lake throughout the year.

St. Helens, many different species of algae became established in the aquatic systems located in the blast zone within 3-4 mo. after the eruption of May 18, 1980. Initial sites of intense algal activity were found in benthic regions associated with warm springs and in the littoral and phytoplanktonic communities of some small lakes. In the summers of 1980-81, overall phytoplankton numbers and activity were low in the large lakes closest to the crater (e.g., Spirit Lake). However, diatoms, blue-green and green algal isolates from these lakes were obtained in laboratory cultures on a reduced inorganic medium used to enumerate metal and sulfur oxidizing bacteria. Species of Nodularia, Pseudanabaena, Anabaena, Oscillatoria, Nitzschia, Tribonema, Chlamydomonas, Chlorella and microflagellates (predominantly cryptomonads) were among the more common forms found in preserved samples or isolated in cultures.																				1529-8817					1983	19	2					238	247		10.1111/j.0022-3646.1983.00238.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-3646.1983.00238.x													WOS:A1983QV71100017
J	Fan, YG; Zhou, LZ; Cheng, L; Song, YW; Xu, WB				Fan, Yanguang; Zhou, Lizhi; Cheng, Lei; Song, Yunwei; Xu, Wenbin			Foraging behavior of the Greater White-fronted Goose (Anser albifrons) wintering at Shengjin Lake: diet shifts and habitat use	AVIAN RESEARCH												Background The habitat use and foraging behaviors of waterbirds are closely related to the distribution and abundance of their food resources. Reductions in food supply can cause waterbirds to shift their habitats and adjust their foraging behaviors to meet their nutritional requirements and increase fitness. Seasonal withdraw of the water levels in the river-connected lakes in the middle and lower Yangtze River floodplain provides abundant food resources for the wintering Greater White-fronted Goose (Anser albifrons). Sedge (Carex) meadows are critical foraging habitats for herbivorous waterbirds in the hydro-fluctuation belt, which changes with hydrological conditions and climate. This study aimed to examine the behavioral responses of the Greater White-fronted Goose to temporal- spatial changes of food availability in the Sedge meadows. Methods Fields surveys were carried out at Shengjin Lake from November 2017 to April 2018. According to the phenology of Shengjin Lake, we divided the wintering season into three periods. The food density, minimum temperature, food items, grass height, and number of foraging geese were surveyed, and samples of the foraging behavior were collected. We analyzed the relationship of the foraging behavior and habitat use relative to the food resources, using correlation and linear regression analyses. Results Along with the temporal-spatial variation and exploitation of food resources, the food abundance and items varied widely among the foraging sites. Over the whole wintering period, the foraging habitat with the highest utilization rate was the meadows, followed by the paddy fields, and then mudflats. Furthermore, the utilization of the meadows showed a bimodal distribution trend, while the paddy fields showed a unimodal trend, and a decreasing trend was seen in the mudflats over the whole wintering period. The results of the generalized linear model showed that the foraging rate was related to the food density and grass height, with a linearly increasing trend during the winter. Conclusions With the change of food resources in the three habitats, the habitats used by the Greater White-fronted Geese shifted from meadows in the hydro-fluctuation belt to the paddy fields, and then back to the meadows. The time budget for foraging activities increased correspondingly, and there was an increase in the foraging rate to compensate for food shortages.					; Zhou, Lizhi/AAF-4535-2021	Cheng, Lei/0009-0004-2755-0413; zhouZhou, li zhiLizhi/0000-0002-5702-4658													2053-7166					FEB 5	2020	11	1							3	10.1186/s40657-020-0189-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40657-020-0189-y													WOS:000513607100001

Results show that the annual rainfall increases from the northwest to the southeast of the NLB. From the temporal variation perspective, annual rainfall decreases slightly in the majority of stations. Furthermore, in spite of no pronounced trends are detected in all stations, the annual rainfall series fluctuate intensely, and present step changes around the year of 1974 and 2002. This change pattern of rainfall is verified by the approximately wet-dry-wet phase pattern, which is exhibited in the standardized departures of annual rainfall series, during the three sub-periods divided by the pre-obtained two change years. In particular, the parametric t test demonstrate that the step change in 2002 is significant. The variations in the rainy season (RS, June-September) rainfall contributed mostly to the changes in the annual rainfall, and a high similarity of change patterns between the RS and annual rainfall is also observed. The long term mean RS and annual rainfall decreases largely from the sub-period of 1960-1974 to 1974-2002, and increased largely from the sub-period of 1974-2002 to 2002-2009 in the NLB. Besides, various elements, such as the summer East Asian summer monsoon and summer Pacific decadal oscillation, may together lead to the step changes in summer rainfall over our study area.

In spring, when the lake was aerobic to the bottom, CO distribution was relatively homogeneous, with concentrations of 40-130 nl .cntdot. l-1. In summer, CO concentrations ranged between 20 and 615 nl .cntdot. l-1 in the aerobic epilimnion and metalimnion, but reached values of > 8000 nl .cntdot. l-1 in the anaerobic hypolimnion. CO increased during the morning and decreased during the afternoon in the upper water layers and in the dark hypolimnion. Incubation of lake water samples from different depths under daylight conditions resulted in a strong CO production. The light-dependent CO production was stimulated by the high numbers of Oscillatoria rubescens in the metalimnion and by material from the lake sediment. Incubation of lake water samples in darkness resulted in CO consumption under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1983	28	1					42	49		10.4319/lo.1983.28.1.0042	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1983.28.1.0042													WOS:A1983QA80900004

The record is based on 223 chironomid samples throughout a 927 cm sediment core providing a temporal resolution of similar to 50 years per sample. We validate the record by applying several statistical reconstruction diagnostics and comparing with pollen and diatom records from the same sediment core. The record suggests the summer temperature varies by similar to 2.5 degrees C across the entire period. A generally warmer period occurred between c.8500 and c.6000 cal yr BP and a cooling trend was initiated from c.5500 cal yr BP. The overall pattern broadly matches the summer insolation at 30 degrees N and the Asian Summer Monsoon records from the surrounding regions suggesting that summer temperatures from the southeast margin of the QTP respond to insolation forcing and monsoon driven variability on a multi-millennial time scale. Modifications of this overall trend are observed on the finer temporal resolution and we suggest that solar activity could be an important mechanism driving the centennial-scale variability. It may have a strengthened effect in the late Holocene when the monsoon influence weakened. Further detailed investigation is needed to disentangle these effects on the climate change over the highlands of southwestern China. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Habitat loss exacerbates pathogen spread: An Agent-based model of avian influenza infection in migratory waterfowl	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY												Habitat availability determines the distribution of migratory waterfowl along their flyway, which further influences the transmission and spatial spread of avian influenza viruses (ATVs). The extensive habitat loss in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway (EAAF) may have potentially altered the virus spread and transmission, but those consequences are rarely studied. We constructed 6 fall migration networks that differed in their level of habitat loss, wherein an increase in habitat loss resulted in smaller networks with fewer sites and links. We integrated an agent-based model and a susceptible-infected-recovered model to simulate waterfowl migration and AIV transmission. We found that extensive habitat loss in the EAAF can 1) relocate the outbreaks northwards, responding to the distribution changes of wintering waterfowl geese, 2) increase the outbreak risk in remaining sites due to larger goose congregations, and 3) facilitate AIV transmission in the migratory population. In addition, our modeling output was in line with the predictions from the concept of "migratory escape", i.e., the migration allows the geese to "escape" from the location where infection risk is high, affecting the pattern of infection prevalence in the waterfowl population. Our modeling shed light on the potential consequences of habitat loss in spreading and transmitting AIV at the flyway scale and suggested the driving mechanisms behind these effects, indicating the importance of conservation in changing spatial and temporal patterns of AIV outbreaks.

Home-checking and mark-recapture methods were used to investigate movements of 178 crayfish and shelter use by 389 crayfish in summer and in autumn. Most crayfish (97.2%) moved but the movement was highly variable. The greater part of the distances moved was less than 10 m day(-1). Multi-hole bricks with one opening have been mostly selected, and the lower level was preferentially occupied; frequently a single crayfish per brick was found. The animal's size affected the majority of the analysed variables: mean daily distance, area fidelity, level of shelter; on the other hand no case was significant for sex. The results highlight that this species is fairly mobile and could colonize waterbodies with similar features even rather rapidly.

Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis in the Baltic Sea -: a supply-side invader?	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Although the Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis (H. Milne-Edwards, 1853) (Crustacea, Decapoda, Varunidae) invaded the Baltic Sea about 80 years ago, published information on its present distribution and abundance in this region is lacking. We provide here information on its Baltic-wide distribution and long-term population dynamics. The species has been found all over the coastal Baltic Sea and also in some adjacent rivers and lakes. The Chinese mitten crab appears to have increased in abundance in recent years in the northeastern part of the Baltic Sea (Gulf of Finland, Gulf of Riga, northern Baltic Proper). Higher catch rates were observed in spring (April-June) and autumn (September-November). The size variation of crabs in different samples was low (mean carapace width 6.1-6.3 cm). Despite findings of gravid females, the reproduction of the mitten crab in the central, northern and eastern Baltic region is considered unlikely due to low salinity and the individuals caught are assumed to actively migrate into the region from the species' main European distribution area (southeastern North Sea), certainly over 1500 km migration distance. Thus, the dynamics of the North Sea population is probably regulating, at least in part, the occurrence of the Chinese mitten crab in the Baltic Sea area.

J	Sponberg, AF; Lodge, DM				Sponberg, AF; Lodge, DM			Seasonal belowground herbivory and a density refuge from waterfowl herbivory for Vallisneria americana	ECOLOGY												Studies of aquatic food webs rarely address the role of migratory waterfowl, even though they are ubiquitous and many are omnivorous. Several species of waterfowl consume belowground plant tubers during winter, yet the impact of such herbivory on future plant abundance is mostly unknown. To test the impact of wintering waterfowl on submerged vegetation, we installed waterfowl exclosures (N = 5) and reference plots (N = 5) open to grazing in Lake Mattamuskeet, North Carolina, USA, where Vallisneria americana (water celery, or tapegrass) dominated the plant community. Over the three-year study period, we sampled above- and belowground plant standing stock every 2-3 mo. Reference plots had a lower density (number per square meter) of Vallisneria tubers than ungrazed exclosures (repeated-measures ANOVA treatment P = 0.038, time X treatment P = 0.025). Percentage loss of tubers in reference plots was positively related to the density of tubers at the onset of winter (R-2 = 0.294, P = 0.026). Despite significant reduction of tubers during winter, no detectable carryover effects of waterfowl exclosure on Vallisneria aboveground biomass occurred in subsequent growing seasons (rmANOVA treatment P = 0.342, time X treatment P = 0.539). Our study detected a threshold tuber density below which waterfowl herbivory on Vallisneria did not occur. Therefore, our results suggest that limits on waterfowl foraging efficiency provide a refuge for aquatic plants subject to intense, seasonal predation.

A large number of taxa were identified. They show the different environmental conditions, in particular several changes of water level leading to the formation of lakes and diverse forms of mires up to raised bogs. The trophic conditions, too, changed several times. The macrofossil record supports the pollen evidence of dense forests during the two early Weichselian interstadials and tundra vegetation during the later ones. Several indicator species show comparably warm summers but very cold winters during the Brorup and Odderade while the climate during Oerel and Glinde was generally cool. Climatic reconstructions using the MCR method were performed on the basis of the beetle finds.																			0939-6314					APR	2005	14	1					31	53		10.1007/s00334-005-0059-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-005-0059-x													WOS:000228315500003
J	Sharma, G; Telwala, Y; Chettri, P				Sharma, Ghanashyam; Telwala, Yasmeen; Chettri, Prakash			Integrating nature-based solutions for water security in fragile mountain ecosystems: Lessons from Dhara Vikas in Sikkim, India	NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS												The Himalayan region faces escalating challenges due to climate change, particularly dwindling springs leading to water scarcity. This study examines water access, economic well-being, and ecosystem resilience in Sikkim's Himalayan region in India, using the Dhara Vikas initiative (implemented in 2008) as a case study. Fieldwork conducted from 2013 to 2015 surveyed 339 households across eight villages, representing 47.56 % of the total households reliant on approximately 63 perennial springs. The survey revealed significant economic disparities in water usage, with higher consumption among affluent groups at lower altitudes. Only 24.1 % of households had year-round water access, highlighting widespread scarcity. The initiative increased spring discharge by 30-40 %, improved water access, and diversified local economies through poultry and dairy farming. Land use and land cover (LULC) analyses from 1989, 2002, and 2013 indicated positive changes in ecosystem resilience. The study also highlights the paradoxical relationship between spring revival initiatives and increased water demand, linking this to livelihood diversification. A roadmap for spring revival is recommended, integrating nature-based solutions with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and IUCN criteria to ensure effectiveness, biodiversity gains, and economic viability. Conclusions emphasize the need for rigorous data collection, collaborative partnerships, and innovative financing to bolster and expand nature-based solutions, ensuring the resilience of mountain communities amidst climate challenges. Recent extreme events, like the Teesta River flooding and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF), underscore the urgency of such initiatives. Future research should build on this data to develop climate adaptation strategies.																				2772-4115				DEC	2024	6								100169	10.1016/j.nbsj.2024.100169	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nbsj.2024.100169													WOS:001535054600005

Results related to light intensity, light penetration into the mat, temperature, pH, NH4+, photosynthetic activity, pigments and zonation of the microbial community. Extreme diurnal variation was found, with an O2 peak of 0.5 mM at 1-2 mm below the mat surface during day and a H2S peak of 2.5 mM at 2-3 mm at night. At the O2-H2S interface, the 2 compounds coexisted over a depth interval of 0.2-1 mm and with a several minute turnover time. The photic zone reached 2.5 mm into the mat in summer, and the main 14CO2 light fixation took place at 1-2 mm of depth. During winter, light and photosynthesis were restricted to the uppermost 1 mm. Quantitative dynamics of O2 and H2S were calculated from chemical gradients and measured diffusion coefficients.

Community Structure of Benthic Algae in a Lotic Ecosystem, Karbala Province-Iraq	BAGHDAD SCIENCE JOURNAL												This study focused on benthic algae (epipelic and attached algae on concrete lining stream) in Bani-Hassan stream in Holly Karbala, Iraq. The qualitative and quantitative studies of benthic algae were done by collecting 240 samples from five sites in the study area for the period from December 2012 to November 2013. Also, the environmental variables of the stream were examined in term of temporary and spatial. The results showed that the stream was alkaline, hard, oligohaline and a well aerated. The total nitrogen to the total phosphorus (TN: TP) ratio indicates nitrogen limitation. 129 species of benthic algae belonging to 57 genera were identified. Bacillariophyceae (diatoms) was the predominant taxon (95 species) followed by Chlorophyceae (16 species), Cyanophyceae (14 species), Euglenophyceae (3 species) and Pyrophyceae (one species). Some genera were found throughout the study period: Nitzschia, Navicula, Cymbella, Gomphonema, Surirella, Cocconeis, Aulacoseira, Oscillatoria, Lyngbya, Spirulina, and Scenedesmus. Site 3 recorded the highest total number of algae in spring 2013, and the lowest total number was at site 5 in Autumn 2013. The chlorophyll-a concentration did not match the total number of algae.

J	Luo, HY; Xu, Q; Jiang, YA; Pu, CH				Luo, Huiyuan; Xu, Qiang; Jiang, Yanan; Pu, Chuanhao			3-D flow velocity time-series analysis from SAR-derived datasets towards maritime glaciers in the Namcha Barwa, Southeastern Tibetan Plateau	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												In reaction to a warming climate in the Southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SETP), the direction and intensity of surface flow in maritime glaciers undergo adjustments, causing glacial debris flow and ice avalanches. The safe operation of mega transportation projects across the region has been seriously threatened, e.g., the Sichuan-Tibet transportation corridor. Consequently, the measurement in three dimensions (3-D) consistently merits attention in the surface flow evolution for this glaciated region. In this study, we first mapped the 3-D and long-term surface flow of the glacier ensemble in the Namcha Barwa during 2019-2022 using the space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technique, specifically applying the pixel offset tracking (POT) method to obtain deformation estimation of SAR-derived data. Subsequently, 3-D glacier velocities were acquired from the Multidimensional Small Baseline Subset (MSBAS) method conducted with the above datasets. Results show that two fastmoving glaciers were detected in the glacier ensemble, namely Dem Glacier and Namjagbrawa Glacier. Dem Glacier mainly flows eastward horizontally with a velocity of approximately 120 m/yr. And the inconspicuous vertical changes reveals that the glacier has sufficient winter supply. Although the detectable proportion of Namjagbrawa Glacier is relatively small, SAR results can perform well in limited pixels verified through optical results. It flows swifter over roughly -150 m/yr in the east, north, and vertical directions due to the vast elevation differences. However, other glaciers in the ensemble generally maintained slow flow, with multidimensional velocities below 20 m/yr. All glaciers' flow velocities and the local climate in temporal are parallelism in the variations, which exhibit summer-accelerated and winter-slowed seasonal patterns. There were no surge signs during the study phase, which does not preclude the possibility of future emergence. The maritime glaciers in the SETP should be therefore multidimensional and continuous monitored to implement early warning and forecasting for mega transportation projects.					; 姜, 亚楠/GSJ-0598-2022	Xu, Qiang/0009-0004-8413-5662; Luo, Huiyuan/0000-0003-3887-2536													0022-1694	1879-2707				MAY	2024	635								131190	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131190	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131190		APR 2024											WOS:001230918800001

Climate change induced salinisation of artificial lakes in the Netherlands and consequences for drinking water production	WATER RESEARCH												In this paper we present a modelling study to investigate the impacts of climate change on the chloride concentration and salinisation processes in two man-made freshwater lakes in the Netherlands, Lake IJsselmeer and Lake Markermeer. We used a transient compartmental chloride and water balance model to elucidate the salinisation processes occurring under present conditions and assess future salinisation under two climate forcing scenarios. The model results showed that the Rhine River is the dominant determinant for the chloride concentration in both lakes, followed by drainage of brackish groundwater from the surrounding polders. The results further show that especially during dry years, seawater intrusion through the tidal closure dam is an important source of chloride to Lake IJsselmeer. The results from the climatic forcing scenarios show that Lake IJsselmeer is especially vulnerable to climate-induced salinisation whereas effects on Lake Markermeer are relatively small. Peak chloride concentrations at the raw water intake of the Andijk drinking water facility on Lake IJsselmeer are projected to increase to values above 250 mg/l in the most far-reaching climate change scenario W+ in 2050 for dry years. This is well above the maximum allowable concentration of 150 mg/l for chloride in drinking water. Modelling showed that climate change impacts the chloride concentrations in a variety of ways: 1) an increasing occurrence of low river flows from summer to autumn reduces the dilution of the chloride that is emitted to the Rhine with a constant load thereby increasing its concentration; 2) increased open water evaporation and reduced rainfall during summer periods and droughts increases the chloride concentration in the water; and 3) rises in sea level increase seawater intrusion through the tidal closure dam of Lake IJsselmeer. The processes described here are likely to affect many other tidal rivers or lakes and should be considered when planning future raw water intake stations for drinking water production or agricultural water supply.

Since the last century, they have been subjected to an increase in mean water levels, which translates over a long period into an increase in the fraction of area covered by water-filled hollows, hypothetically slowly transforming them into shallow lakes as the hollows coalesce in larger ponds (aqualysis). This phenomenon progressively changes the hydrological reaction of aqualysed fens to rain events. Four sites (two fens and two shallow lakes), were monitored for rainfall, water table levels and surface runoff during two years in the La Grande River basin. Summer and fall hydrographs for rain generated events as well as relation between in situ water table and outlet surface runoff were compared, respectively via shape statistics and analyses of covariance. Depending on the hydrological property, results show some differences between sites, but not always systematically between fens and lakes. Fens had fewer runoff events than lakes but the events were of greater magnitude and duration. Four of the six hydrographs shape statistics (shape mean and variance, rising and falling slopes) were found to be significantly different between some sites, lakes (contrary to fens) being always in the same category. These results also indicate that the location and shape of individual ponds may play an important role in runoff generation. Concerning the relation between water table level and outlet runoff, regression slopes of fens were found to be steeper than those of lakes, especially in wet conditions. Climate change impact studies results suggest increases in annual runoff in this region in the future; this paper gives some insight about future hydrologic response of fens.					; St-Hilaire, André/W-7120-2019	St-Hilaire, Andre/0000-0001-8443-5885; St-Hilaire, Andre/0000-0001-9161-4742; 													0701-1784	1918-1817				WIN	2009	34	4			SI		365	379		10.4296/cwrj3404365	http://dx.doi.org/10.4296/cwrj3404365													WOS:000273587400005
J	GRAS, R; SAINTJEAN, L				GRAS, R; SAINTJEAN, L			LENGTH TIME AND CHARACTERISTICS OF JUVENILE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME CLADOCERA FROM LAKE CHAD	CAHIERS ORSTOM HYDROBIOLOGIE												The duration of the juvenile period (Dj) was determined in the laboratory at 29-30.degree. C (Aug. 1968) and at 24-25.degree. C (Jan. 1969). The winter species in Lake Chad [Central Africa] (Daphnia barbata, D. lumholtzi, D. longispina) develop faster than the summer species (Diaphanosoma excisum, Moina micrura, Ceriodaphnia cornuta). The same is true for the duration of the embryonic period. Moina is the fastest, the relative duration of the juvenile period (Dj") being 1.2 as an average, and 0.97 for about 50% of the individuals observed (Dj = 22 h and 38 j at 30 and 25.degree. C). For any given species and any given set of conditions, different Dj are observed, which may result from a variation of the number of the juvenile instars. These numbers were estimated for each species from the observed individuals values of D"j and making the supposition that the relative duration of a mean juvenile instar is about 0.5. Some individuals of Moina would lay their first brood after 2 stages, others after 3. For Diaphanosoma and D. barbata these numbers would be 4, 5 or 6. The relative duration of the juvenile period was estimated by 2 methods for natural populations of Moina and Diaphanosoma. Experimental estimation was obtained after evaluation of the number of juvenile instars from the length frequency distribution of the populations and using the value of Dj determined in the laboratory. A theoretical estimation was calculated. The 2 estimations are nearly the same and show an acceleration of development and a decrease of number of juvenile instars between 1968 (period of high water level) and 1973 (low water level). These modifications explain the changes in the structure observed between these 2 periods. They seem to result from an improvement of the nutritional conditions in the lake consecutive to the fall of the water level. Two schematic and hypothetical processes by which the characteristics and the duration of the juvenile development may evolve with temperature and nutritional conditions are described. These processes define a framework for further research on the Cladocera development.																			0373-9422						1978	12	2					119	136																WOS:A1978GT69900002
J	Kisand, V; Tammert, H				Kisand, V; Tammert, H			Bacterioplankton strategies for leucine and glucose uptake after a cyanobacterial bloom in an eutrophic shallow lake	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY					International Conference on Enzymes in the Environment	JUL, 1999	GRANADA, SPAIN					Extracellular enzyme activities and the kinetics of glucose and leucine uptake were measured to study the role of different substrate pools for bacterioplankton in a shallow eutrophic lake. The study took place during the period of cyanobacterial bloom in late summer and its collapse in the autumn. Leucine aminopeptidase activity (LAP), beta -glucosidase activity (beta -Gluc), (3)H-leucine incorporation (LI) and (14)C-glucose incorporation (GI) were measured in Lake Vortsjarv during the autumn of 1997 (September-October). The kinetic parameters V(max) and K(m) were determined for both enzymes using artificial fluorogenic substrates (leucine amino-methylcoumarin and methyl-umbelliferyl beta -glucose). Leucine and glucose uptake were measured using radiolabelled compounds. Abundance and production of bacterioplankton were also measured. Several environmental parameters including temperature, nutrient concentrations, seston content, and phytoplankton characteristics such as biomass, chlorophyll alpha concentration, and primary production were followed. The GI (V(max)) correlated positively with release of low molecular weight products of primary production, beta -Gluc activity was more closely correlated with polymeric substrates released after breakdown of cyanobacterial bloom. LAP specific activity (i.e. activity per cell) increased towards the end of the experimental period and correlated more closely with the presence of specific populations than to the total number of bacteria. By the end of the experiment time, LI switched to a lower affinity system with higher specific V(max) and K(M) Bacteria preferentially used available carbon (as dissolved glucose) over carbon sources derived from the exoenzymatic hydrolysis of polymers. However, both sources of leucine (dissolved and hydrolysis products) were used equally by bacteria. Phytoplankton (dominated by cyanophytes) was the main origin of readily available dissolved low molecular weight compounds. After a cyanobacterial bloom some populations of bacteria grew on the dead cell material of algae, but the total number of heterotrophic bacteria decreased from approximately 7 x 10(6) to 1.9 x 10(6) ml(-1).

The study is focused on the Zuqim (Feshcha) spring complex located on the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea, which exhibits a drop of tens of meters in its water level over the last few decades. In this exceptional "field lab", fluctuations and trends in the flow regime are recognized, as well as the contemporaneous geochemical variations. Lithological fades variations have a pronounced effect on the underground flow regime. The following main processes were recognized: (a) slight shifting of the long-standing springs eastward, following the retreating shore; (b) extension of the hydrologic system southward without significant change in the total discharge of the entire spring complex. The new seepages are characterized by high variability in salinity; and (c) continuous refreshing of the spring water as a result of prolonged flushing of old trapped brines. The water of the Zuqim springs lie on mixing lines between two local brine types and diluted brine of the Lisan Lake - the precursor of the Dead Sea. Based on our findings, future development processes in the spring complex are predicted, which is essential because of their impact on the endemic ecosystem that relies on this water. In addition, continuation of the rapid drop in lake level is expected to cause intensification of erosional processes, such as deepening of flow gullies. Shifting of the entire hydrological system southward and migration along with the retreating shore is also expected to continue, as well as the continuous decrease in the water salinity.

After 5 years of poststocking monitoring (2012-2016), mark-recapture data sets have yielded important information regarding survival, dispersal shortly after stocking, post-establishment movement and emigration, and growth, clarifying a path forward for Lake Sturgeon recovery initiatives in this system. Based on Cormack-Jolly-Seber models, mean cohort-specific apparent survival (i.e., consolidated survival and retention of fish within the reach) for Lake Sturgeon reared to age 1 in the hatchery from the time of stocking until the period of post-first-winter recapture in the wild (predominantly at age 2) was estimated to range from 0.08 (95% CI = 0.06-0.11) to 0.49 (95% CI = 0.41-0.56); dispersal occurring shortly after stocking was identified as at least partially influential. In the years after poststocking establishment (i.e., age 2 and older), apparent survival of the fish that established in the primary reach was estimated at 0.99-1.00, indicative of negligible mortality and negligible emigration. The stocked Lake Sturgeon exhibited growth patterns similar to (or even outpacing) those of wild populations occupying comparable habitats in Manitoba. Moreover, data indicate that growth trajectories set early in life persist throughout the juvenile stage. The results of upper Nelson River poststocking monitoring provide quantitative support for a stocking strategy predicated on rearing Lake Sturgeon over winter in the hatchery followed by release at age 1 during spring, thus striking a balance between high poststocking survival and moderate hatchery rearing costs.

PHYSICO-CHEMICAL FACTORS AND BIODIVERSITY OF MICROALGAL FLORA IN RABIGH LAGOON UNDER GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												structure and some abiotic parameters of Rabigh Lagoon, Saudi Arabia, during the 2019 seasons. The study aimed to assess Rabigh Lagoon's environmental health while also reviewing the ecological database for the area under investigation. Seven sites were studied, with latitudes ranging from 22.9978 degrees to 22.8519 degrees N and longitudes ranging from 38.8339 degrees to 38.9616 degrees E. Temperature, Transparency, pH, DO, Salinity%, Nutrients, Nitrogen, and phosphorus are abiotic factors as the ecological parameters. The micro-algal flora was identified and divided into five micro-algal flora groups. Chlorophyll-a levels in the spring range from 14.25 mu g.l(-1) to 6.32 mu g.l(-1) in the summer. Micro-benthic fauna groups were identified as Copepoda, Protista, and Rotifera. According to transparency methods for calculating the Trophic status index besides the chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus, methods were used to assess the eutrophication of the Rabigh Lagoon. Rabigh Lagoon is a mesotrophic ecosystem, according to the study.

Pliocene-Pleistocene hydrology and pluvial lake during Marine Isotope Stages 5a and 4, Deep Springs Valley, western Great Basin, Inyo County, California	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Deep Springs Valley (DSV) is a hydrologically isolated valley between the White and Inyo mountains that is commonly excluded from regional paleohydrology and paleoclimatology. Previous studies showed that uplift of Deep Springs ridge (informal name) by the Deep Springs fault defeated streams crossing DSV and hydrologically isolated the valley sometime after eruption of the Pleistocene Bishop Tuff (0.772 Ma). Here, we present tephrochronology and clast counts that reaffirms interruption of the Pliocene-Pleistocene hydrology and formation of DSV during the Pleistocene. Paleontology and infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) dates indicate a freshwater lake inundated Deep Springs Valley from ca. 83-61 ka or during Late Pleistocene Marine Isotope Stages 5a (MIS 5a; ca. 82 ka peak) and 4 (MIS 4; ca. 71-57 ka). The age of pluvial Deep Springs Lake coincides with pluvial lakes in Owens Valley and Columbus Salt Marsh and documents greater effective precipitation in southwestern North America during MIS 5a and MIS 4. In addition, we hypothesize that Deep Springs Lake was a balanced-fill lake that overflowed into Eureka Valley via the Soldier Pass wind gap during MIS 5a and MIS 4. DSV hydrology has implications for dispersal and endemism of the Deep Springs black toad (Anaxyrus exsul).

Long-Term Stocking Success of Largemouth Bass and the Relationship to Natural Populations	BALANCING FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND WATER USES FOR IMPOUNDED RIVER SYSTEMS	American Fisheries Society Symposium				4th North American Reservoir Symposium on Balancing Fisheries Management and Water Uses for Impounded River Systems	JUN 07-09, 2007	Atlanta, GA	Amer Fisheries Soc, SE Div Reservoir Comm				Despite the widespread use of Supplemental stocking, Survival of age-0 and age-1 stocked fish is often variable and stocking Success is not commonly evaluated through adult size-classes. We evaluated the long-term contribution of stocked largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides from three annual stockings in 1.5 reservoirs in Illinois. Stocked largemouth bass were marked with fill clips and sampled for 5 years. Contribution Of stocked fish to the population was highest for age-0 (21%) and age-1 largemouth bass (17%) but decreased significantly in adult fish (5%). Contribution of stocked bass was not associated with either populations of wild largemouth bass or latitude. Survival of stocked fish was similar to Survival of wild fish through age 1. Age-0 abundance of wild and stocked largemouth bass were positively correlated in the fall following stocking, Suggesting that similar factors may influence initial Survival. Survival of stocked fish from age-1 to adult age decreased significantly compared to wild fish, resulting in low contribution of stocked bass to the adult Population. Adult and age-1 catch per unit effort of stocked largemouth bass were positively correlated with the mean size of stocked bass in the first fall after stocking and the following spring, indicating that lakes with higher growth rates have increased contribution of stocked fish. We found limited contribution of stocked fish to adult largemouth bass populations due to low survival from age-1 to adult age. Assessments of fish stocking success should evaluate survival of stocked fish through adult ages or they may omit a critical period for mortality.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-06-6				2008	62						413	426																WOS:000263597300026

In a combined laboratory and field study over 10years, we investigated how two centric diatom species, Cyclotella baicalensis and Cyclotella minuta, have coexisted in the plankton of Lake Baikal in Siberia for over 100,000years. 2. The species differ substantially in cell size: C.baicalensis has some of the largest cells found in freshwater phytoplankton at up to 135m diameter, but C.minuta can be as small as 10m. They illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of small versus large size in a planktonic environment. Other differences included a faster division rate of C.minuta but a faster rate of biovolume increase in C.baicalensis. 3. Timing of their life cycles and peak cell abundances differed. C.baicalensis peaked in June or July after ice break-up, but C.minuta usually peaked in autumn, because it was able to tolerate higher temperatures and survive higher in the water column during summer stratification, allowing growth to begin earlier than other species. 4. Satellite-derived surface temperature data combined with temperature tolerances of each species revealed how variation in upwelling affected population development. 5. Speciation may have occurred after a change in environmental conditions allowed larger cells to remain in suspension throughout the year. Long-term co-existence became possible because ecological differences reduced interspecific competition.

Numbers of the organism decreased in the lake immediately following turnover in Oct. Significant concentrations of Metallogenium microcolonies did not recur until spring, after the lake had stratified. During stratification the distribution of particulate Mn closely followed the distribution of Metallogenium. EDAX [energy dispersive X-ray] analysis, confirmed by EM analyses of the encrustation, showed that the primary component was Mn. Fe and some trace elements were also precipitated on the organism but to a lesser degree. In addition, phosphate, the primary substance limiting phytoplankton growth in Lake Washington, was found in the encrustation, indicating Metallogenium may be important in limiting algal blooms in the lake. Attempts to grow Metallogenium in the laboratory were unsuccessful. This inability, combined with the negative results of thin-sectioning and acridine orange staining of Metallogenium microcolonies, suggests that the microcolonial structures seen in Lake Washington are not a living form of an organism.																			0095-3628	1432-184X					1980	6	2					125	140		10.1007/BF02010551	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02010551								24226963					WOS:A1980JY51200004

Here, we present a high-resolution (ca. 100 years per sample) organic carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13(org)) record from bulk samples from the Lujiaowan10 section in the northern piedmont of the Tienshan Mountains, Xinjiang Province, northwestern China. A robust chronology is provided by K-feldspar pIRIR dating. During the early to middle Holocene, from 12 ka to 6 ka (1 ka = 1000 years ago), the delta C-13(org) values are relatively invariant with an average of around -22.5 parts per thousand. After about 6 ka, the delta C-13(org) values exhibit an overall negative trend with the most negative value of -25.2 parts per thousand occurring in the uppermost part of the section, within the interval of Holocene soil formation. Our investigation of the relationship between modern climatic variables and surface soil delta C-13(org) values from the region reveals a significant negative correlation between surface soil delta C-13(org) and summer precipitation amount (June to August). Therefore, we used the calibration model between summer precipitation amount and surface soil delta C-13(org) to quantitatively reconstruct the Holocene summer precipitation history of the study area. Our results indicate that summer precipitation in the region was the lowest (ca. 85 mm) during the early to middle Holocene (12-6 ka); however, after 6 ka, the precipitation increased continuously to about 137 mm per year at the present. Our reconstruction is generally consistent with climate simulation results and with regional effective moisture records. Thus, we conclude that the highest summer precipitation, and therefore the wettest climate, occurred in the late Holocene. Decreasing Northern Hemisphere summer insolation may have effected a change in the CGT (circumglobal teleconnection) from a positive to negative phase and, together with more negative trends in AO (Arctic Oscillation) or NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation), may have been responsible for the observed pattern of summer precipitation evolution.

These 2 forms differ substantially in morphology and life cycle and thus are separated into 2 taxa. The form that is green with zoochlorellae, has microscleres, and gemmulates in the winter is named S. stankovici. The form that is brown, lacks microscleres, and does not gemmulate is described as OBRIDOSPONGILLA STANKOVICI gen. et. sp. nov. A new sponge, Ochridaspongia interlithonis sp. nov., is described. It occurs as very small, brown, mound-like, non-gemmulating, epilithic growths below the surface of the bottom in spaces between stones in regions of the shallow littoral zone where there are cold, sublacustrine springs. This habitat is called the sublacustrine interlithon. The new sponge is closely related to O. rotunda, a large species living at depths of 25-70 m.																			0003-9136						1984	99	3					331	339																WOS:A1984SF83700005
J	Moghim, S				Moghim, Sanaz			Impact of climate variation on hydrometeorology in Iran	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Results confirm that Iran like many countries is affected by high climate variability, which has influenced hydroclimatological variables such as temperature, evaporation, precipitation, runoff, and radiation. This study uses Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) data to assess hydrological cycle changes in Iran during a long period (Jan1948-Jan2017). Results show that hydrometeorological variables have significant changes (p-value <.01) during the period of 2010-2017 relative to the baseline period (2004-2009). Most extreme values of these variables including temperature, evaporation, precipitation, wind, and downward longwave radiation occurred recently (in 2015 to 2017). The average temperature of Iran has an upward trend in most months particularly in summer and winter followed by a significant increase of evaporation since 1948 (p-value <.01). Furthermore, the results show significant changes in downward longwave and shortwave radiation, which can be caused by changes in temperature and cloud types. Climate variation has influenced extreme hydro meteorological variables particularly precipitation. The analysis of the results in this study can provide insight into this highly interconnected hydrometeorological changes.																			0921-8181	1872-6364				NOV	2018	170						93	105		10.1016/j.gloplacha.2018.08.013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2018.08.013													WOS:000447477100007

Geomorphology and InSAR-Tracked Surface Displacements in an Ice-Rich Yedoma Landscape	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Ice-ridge Yedoma terrain is susceptible to vertical surface displacements by thaw and refreeze of ground ice, and geomorphological processes of mass wasting, erosion and sedimentation. Here we explore the relation between a 3 year data set of InSAR measurements of vertical surface displacements during the thaw season, and geomorphological features in an area in the Indigirka Lowlands, Northeast Siberia. The geomorphology is presented in a geomorphological map, based on interpretation of high resolution visible spectrum satellite imagery, field surveys and available data from paleo-environmental research. The main landforms comprise overlapping drained thaw lake basins and lakes, erosion remnants of Late Pleistocene Yedoma deposits, and a floodplain of a high-sinuosity anastomosing river with ancient river terrace remnants. The spatial distribution of drained thaw lake basins and Yedoma erosion remnants in the study area and its surroundings is influenced by neotectonic movements. The 3 years of InSAR measurement include 2 years of high snowfall and extreme river flooding (2017-2018) and 1 year of modest snowfall, early spring and warm summer (2019). The magnitude of surface displacements varies among the years, and show considerable spatial variation. Distinct spatial clusters of displacement trajectories can be discerned, which relate to geomorphological processes and ground ice conditions. Strong subsidence occurred in particular in 2019. In the wet year of 2017, marked heave occurred at Yedoma plateau surfaces, likely by ice accumulation at the top of the permafrost driven by excess precipitation. The spatial variability of surface displacements is high. This is explored by statistical analysis, and is attributed to the interaction of various processes. Next to ground ice volume change, also sedimentation (peat, colluvial deposition) and shrinkage or swelling of soils with changing water content may have contributed. Tussock tundra areas covered by the extreme 2017 and 2018 spring floods show high subsidence rates and an increase of midsummer thaw depths. We hypothesize that increased flood heights along Siberian lowland rivers potentially induce deeper thaw and subsidence on floodplain margins, and also lowers the drainage thresholds of thaw lakes. Both mechanisms tend to increase floodplain area. This may increase CH4 emission from floodplains, but also may enhance carbon storage in floodplain sedimentary environments.

The fauna of this river includes an invertebrate fauna composed of both endemic and widespread species, which has, however, been only poorly studied until now. The aim of the present study was to make a review of the ecological role of the benthic inland water crustaceans of the River Cautin, in order to understand their importance in the ecosystem of the river. The literature revealed the presence of abundant populations of amphipods and freshwater crabs as well as of aquatic insects along the river's course. Many of these crustaceans are prey for both introduced salmonids and native fishes. Similar results have been reported for other southern Argentinean and Chilean Patagonian rivers.

However, little is known about the impact of spatial temperature gradients, their vulnerability to global warming, and their importance for interacting populations. Here, we studied the vertical distribution of two planktivorous fish species (Coregonus spp.) and their zooplankton prey in the deep, oligotrophic Lake Stechlin (Germany). The night-time vertical centre of gravity both of the fish populations and of two of their prey groups, daphnids and copepods, were significantly correlated to the seasonally varying water temperature between March and December 2005. During the warmer months, fish and zooplankton occurred closer to the surface of the lake and experienced higher temperatures. The Coregonus populations differed significantly in their centre of gravity; hence, also, the temperature experienced by the populations was different. Likewise, daphnids and copepods occurred in different water depths and hence experienced different temperatures at least during the summer months. We conclude that any changes in the vertical temperature gradient of the lake as a result of potential future global warming may impact the two fish populations differently, and may shape interaction strength and timing between fish and their zooplankton prey.

Eight species of fish were caught in a total of 89 lifts. The variability of the catches was analyzed after a transformation into y = log (x + 1). For the major species (apart from yellow perch) there were remarkable similarities between species for error variances associated with catches from nets and from meshes. The total error variance associated with a catch from any net was 0.0575 (C.V. = 59.7%). Total error variance associated with a catch from a single mesh was 0.0852 (C.V. = 75.6%). These values are compared to those from other studies and an error variance estimate of 0.0868 (C.V. = 76.5%) was considered to be an appropriate value for gillnet catches in fresh waters. In sampling programmes more than six nets would need to be used for confidence limits to be below half or more than twice the geometric mean.																			0022-1112	1095-8649				JUN	1986	28	6					671	678		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1986.tb05202.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1986.tb05202.x													WOS:A1986D238400003

Paleoseismic history of the Fallen Leaf segment of the West Tahoe-Dollar Point fault reconstructed from slide deposits in the Lake Tahoe Basin, California-Nevada	GEOSPHERE												The West Tahoe-Dollar Point fault (WTDPF) extends along the western margin of the Lake Tahoe Basin (northern Sierra Nevada, western United States) and is characterized as its most hazardous fault. Fallen Leaf Lake, Cascade Lake, and Emerald Bay are three subbasins of the Lake Tahoe Basin, located south of Lake Tahoe, and provide an opportunity to image primary earthquake deformation along the WTDPF and associated landslide deposits. Here we present results from high-resolution seismic Chirp (compressed high intensity radar pulse) surveys in Fallen Leaf Lake and Cascade Lake, multibeam bathymetry coverage of Fallen Leaf Lake, onshore Lidar (light detection and ranging) data for the southern Lake Tahoe Basin, and radiocarbon dates from piston cores in Fallen Leaf Lake and Emerald Bay. Slide deposits imaged beneath Fallen Leaf Lake appear to be synchronous with slides in Lake Tahoe, Emerald Bay, and Cascade Lake. The temporal correlation of slides between multiple basins suggests triggering by earthquakes on the WTDPF system. If this correlation is correct, we postulate a recurrence interval of similar to 3-4 k.y. for large earthquakes on the Fallen Leaf Lake segment of the WTDPF, and the time since the most recent event (similar to 4.5 k.y. ago) exceeds this recurrence time. In addition, Chirp data beneath Cascade Lake image strands of the WTDPF offsetting the lake floor as much as similar to 7.5 m. The Cascade Lake data combined with onshore Lidar allow us to map the WTDPF continuously between Fallen Leaf Lake and Cascade Lake. This improved mapping of the WTDPF reveals the fault geometry and architecture south of Lake Tahoe and improves the geohazard assessment of the region.

Three water bodies, the Tbilisi Sea, Kumisi and Lisi lakes, in the South Caucasus region near Tbilisi, Georgia, were monitored in 2006-2009 to determine microbiological quality using standard methods. Microbial pollution indicators were determined in parallel with phytoplankton abundance and measurement of a number of physical-chemical parameters. Kumisi Lake, a brackish water body in an active agricultural area, appeared to be the most polluted, whereas the Tbilisi Sea, a freshwater reservoir was the least polluted. High values for fecal indicators in all three lakes in summer and early autumn were revealed. In our study, total enterococci counts (TEC) appeared to be a better indicator than either fecal or total coliform counts for the evaluation of fresh and brackish microbial water quality. We found significant correlation between total Vibrio counts and TEC for all three water bodies. Prevalence of somatic coliphages and V. cholerae-specific phages as additional water pollution indicator significantly correlated with abundance of the host bacteria. Particular phytoplankton groups in the lakes responded to the changes of fecal indicators; however, no correlation was observed between dominant zooplankton taxonomic groups and microbial parameters.					; Janelidze, Nino/LDF-3821-2024	Janelidze, Nino/0000-0001-5417-7512; Tediashvili, Marina/0000-0003-4035-4746													1477-8920						2013	11	2					333	345		10.2166/wh.2013.057	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wh.2013.057								23708580					WOS:000323560100014

Fine-scale spatial variation in ice cover and surface temperature trends across the surface of the Laurentian Great Lakes	CLIMATIC CHANGE												The effects of climate change on north temperate freshwater ecosystems include increasing water temperatures and decreasing ice cover. Here we compare those trends in the Laurentian Great Lakes at three spatial scales to evaluate how warming varies across the surface of these massive inland water bodies. We compiled seasonal ice cover duration (1973-2013) and lake summer surface water temperatures (LSSWT; 1994-2013), and analyzed spatial patterns and trends at lake-wide, lake sub-basin, and fine spatial scales and compared those to reported lake- and basin-wide trends. At the lake-wide scale we found declining ice duration and warming LSSWT patterns consistent with previous studies. At the lake sub-basin scale, our statistical models identified distinct warming trends within each lake that included significant breakpoints in ice duration for 13 sub-basins, consistent linear declines in 11 sub-basins, and no trends in 4 sub-basins. At the finest scale, we found that the northern- and eastern-most portions of each Great Lake, especially in nearshore areas, have experienced faster rates of LSSWT warming and shortening ice duration than those previously reported from trends at the lake scale. We conclude that lake-level analyses mask significant spatial and temporal variation in warming patterns within the Laurentian Great Lakes. Recognizing spatial variability in rates of change can inform both mechanistic modeling of ecosystem responses and planning for long-term management of these large freshwater ecosystems.					; Mason, Lacey/X-3045-2018	McIntyre, Peter/0000-0003-1809-7552; Smith, Sigrid/0000-0001-8792-9549; Mason, Lacey/0000-0003-1541-3134													0165-0009	1573-1480				SEP	2016	138	1-2					71	83		10.1007/s10584-016-1721-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-016-1721-2													WOS:000382138400006

Paleolandscape and paleoenvironmental interpretation of spring-deposited sediments in Dakhleh Oasis, Western Desert of Egypt	CATENA												Iron-rich sediments in Dakhleh Oasis. Western Desert of Egypt. have been recognized as spring mounds and as archaeological sites where Paleolithic materials have been recovered Detailed sedimentologic investigation and mapping of these features reveal that spring mound sediments were deposited in a shallow vegetated wetland formed by the discharge of iron-rich Nubian Aquifer waters along the southern margin of the oasis, controlled largely by localized faulting and the variable paleotopography of the basin floor The spring sediments represent peri-lacustrine or lake independent features and can be differentiated from fully lacustrine deposits on the basis of their sedimentary characteristics as well as the presence of goethite and jarosite in a region where authigenic deposition during Pleistocene pluvial activity principally resulted in tufas and lacustrine marls. Spring mound formation incorporated sediment through the ponding of surface water, aeolian entrapment by local vegetation, and the formation of iron precipitates in a low-energy. oxidative and acidic environment that was not dependent upon surface water inputs into the Dakhleh basin The potentially interpluvial nature of this water resource makes it an important sedimentary archive for archaeological investigations in the basin. The Dakhleh spring mounds record a unique groundwater controlled paleoenvironment, providing the first evidence of a bog iron in Egypt and one of the few occurrences of iron-rich wetland remnants in the modern Sahara.

J	Wu, P; Liu, YJ; Ding, YH; Li, XC; Wang, J				Wu, Ping; Liu, Yanju; Ding, Yihui; Li, Xiucang; Wang, Jing			Modulation of sea surface temperature over the North Atlantic and Indian-Pacific warm pool on interdecadal change of summer precipitation over northwest China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Under the background of global warming, the summer precipitation over northwest China (NW) has experienced a significant interdecadal shift since the early 1990s, followed by a great increase in precipitation. This increase was mainly due to the anomalous water vapour input from the eastern boundary, whose transport has gradually become the main moisture transport belt affecting summer precipitation over NW in the past 30 years. Further research indicates that the anomalous easterly water vapour transport mainly originates from the Arctic and North Pacific Oceans. The interdecadal increase in precipitation and changes in water vapour transport pathways are related to the interdecadal warming of the North Atlantic (NA) and Indian-Pacific warm pool (IPWP) in the mid-1980s. The IPWP warming potentially weakens the land-sea thermal gradient, dampens the meridional circulation in East Asia, and thereby significantly reduces the southerly water vapour transport of the Asian summer monsoon, and generates anomalous northeasterly water vapour transport from high latitudes over East Asia. Moreover, the warmer sea surface temperature (SST) over the IPWP and NA can induce an anomalous teleconnection wave train, with anomalous anticyclones over Lake Baikal and the Aleutian Islands, and an anomalous cyclone over Japan. This type of teleconnection wave train contributes to anomalous northerly winds over eastern China and easterly winds over NW. The above-mentioned anomalous circulation favours moisture transport from both the Arctic and North Pacific toward the NW, resulting in an increase in summer precipitation associated with the anomalous regional ascending motion.																			0899-8418	1097-0088				DEC 30	2022	42	16					8526	8538		10.1002/joc.7743	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.7743		JUL 2022											WOS:000829517700001
J	Noges, P				Noges, P			Water and nutrient mass balance of the partly meromictic temperate Lake Verevi	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Mass balances of total nitrogen and total phosphorus were calculated for Lake Verevi (area 0.126 km(2), maximum depth 11 m, mean depth 3.6 m), a sharply stratified small lake located in South Estonia within the borders of the town Elva. The lake has up to 10 small inflows but only three of them are nearly permanent. Accidental overflows from near-by oxidation ponds during high floods have been the major source of the nutrient load of the lake in the past. L. Verevi receives a significant part of its inflow from groundwater, which is difficult to measure. In dry years the outflow is temporary. During summer the lake is sharply thermally and chemically stratified. The spring turnover is often incomplete even in homothermal conditions, thus giving the lake some meromictic features. The influx of nitrogen exceeded the outflux at any supposed proportion (20%, 50%, 80%) of surface runoff. The lake retained 45-90% of the nitrogen influx by sedimentation and/or by denitrification. The largest nitrogen losses with loss rates more than 10 kg N d(-1) occurred in May and June. The calculated phosphorus retention rate became strongly negative during mixing periods. From June to November, phosphorus release from the sediment exceeded sedimentation by 205 kg in 1991 and by 79 kg in 1993. Earlier stagnation and absence of a full spring turnover in the 2000 has slowed down the recovery of the lake because less phosphorus is flushed out. However, the stronger stratification and significantly smaller phosphorus content in the epilimnion limits biological activity and as a result improves the water quality of the surface layer.

Great Crested Grebes migrate SE to winter mainly in southern parts of the (former) Soviet Union or Turkey (Fennoscandian birds), or in the central European lakes (individuals from northwestern Europe). A second wintering area is found to the SW, along the southern North Sea coasts. The proportion of Dutch grebes recovered in winter within The Netherlands increased significantly over the last decades. Field counts show that also the absolute number of moulting and wintering grebes in The Netherlands increased dramatically since the sixties, whereas the total number of grebes wintering in Switzerland decreased. This increase in local wintering may be one of the causes of the important increase in the breeding population since the seventies. Although not enough data are available, the results suggest that the increase in the proportion of locally wintering Dutch Great Crested Grebes may reflect changes in the genetic composition of the Dutch breeding population. This presumed evolutionary change would have been caused by extensive man-made changes to the habitat (large areas of newly created lakes) together with a strong selective advantage for locally overwintering individuals.

This study develops a neural network model to improve the accuracy in monitoring water quality of Lake Taihu, China, a large shallow subtropical lake. A three-layer back-propagation neural network is built up to estimate concentrations Of chlorophyll-a, total suspended matter and dissolved organic carbon at the same lime from in-situ measured water surface spectra. The neural network is trained by the simultaneously in-situ measured water surface spectra and water quality parameters (including concentrations of chlorophyll-a, total suspended matter and dissolved organic carbon) in 39 sampling stations of Lake Taihu in the campaign in winter of 2007. Then, the neural network model is tested by the data measured in both the left 9 sampling stations in the campaign in winter of 2007 and the 9 sampling stations in the campaign in winter of 2006. The estimated errors of the three kinds of water quality parameters are less than 30% in both campaigns in winters of 2006 and 2007. The results show that this neural network model has high seasonal applicability, and is very useful in monitoring of water quality of Lake Taihu from water surface spectra measured in future winters.

J	Nagano, M; Yagi, A; Yoshida, T				Nagano, Mariko; Yagi, Akihiko; Yoshida, Takehito			Seasonal pattern and induction cues of diel vertical migration of Chaoborus flavicans in Lake Fukami-ike, Nagano, Japan	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Diel vertical migration (DVM), which is a well-known behavior of planktonic organisms, is influenced by several factors, including predation, ultraviolet radiation, temperature, and food. The larvae of Chaoborus (Diptera) exhibit DVM in lakes and ponds. However, it is unclear whether the DVM of Chaoborus larvae changes seasonally and whether induction cues influence the seasonal pattern of DVM. In this study, we report that Chaoborus larvae showed DVM throughout the year in a eutrophic lake (Lake Fukami-ike, Japan). Our laboratory experiment demonstrated that the larvae showed DVM in response to light change even when they were not exposed to fish kairomone at water temperatures typical of winter and summer in the studied lake. These results differed from those of previous studies on other Chaoborus populations showing that both fish kairomone and light change were necessary to induce DVM, which suggests variation in the induction cues among local populations. We suggest that for Chaoborus larvae in Lake Fukami-ike, a seasonally continuous DVM induced solely by light change is adaptive to their particular habitat where the population is exposed to fish predation throughout the year.

The climatology includes an evaluation of the seasonal frequency and intensity of storms as well as an analysis of extreme event intensity. ENSO variability is evaluated by ENSO phase with emphasis on boreal winter. Results show an enhanced East Coast storm track during El Nino as well as an equatorward shift in storm tracks in the North Pacific for storms generated from both the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis and ERA-40 datasets. Observed precipitation close to a storm's center is used to determine which phase of the ENSO cycle is associated with the most productive storms and where they occur. During El Nino winters, a precipitation maximum is located east of the Appalachians and is associated with an enhanced East Coast storm track. During La Nina winters, the precipitation maximum shifts to the Ohio Valley and is associated with an enhanced Great Lakes storm track. Along the U.S. west coast, there is a precipitation maximum in the Pacific Northwest during La Nina winters, which is due to a storm track west of Washington State.

(Amphipoda: Gammaridea) from Lake Baikal, Siberia, with redescription of E. cyanoides (Sowinsky) and remarks on taxonomy of the genus Eulimnogammarus	ZOOTAXA												A new amphipod species of the endemic fauna of Lake Baikal (East Siberia, Russia), Eulimnogammarus messerschmidtii sp. n., from the littoral zone of the northern part of the lake is described. The species is characterized by the presence of a group of spines with dense setae on the last 4 body segments. The basal peduncular segment of antenna 1 bears bunches of dense setae without spines, uropods 3 are covered by dense simple setae without plumose setae and the outer ramus has a second small article. The body length of sampled specimens ranges from 7.5 to 18 mm. Population analysis at one of the sampling points revealed a spring-summer reproduction period for this species. This species was previously erroneously identified as E. cyanoides. E. cyanoides is here redescribed in details based on the lectotype. The differences between E. messerschmidtii sp. n., E. cyanoides and other closely related Eulimnogammarus species are described.

The delta(37)Cl values for the pre-overturn Dead Sea cannot be explained by the prevailing model on the evolution of the Dead Sea during the last few centuries and require corroboration by more measurements. The 1979 overturn wiped out almost completely the isotopic differences between the UWM and LWM. Even so, Cl isotope data could be used to decipher physical processes related to the overturn such as incomplete homogenization of the deep water mass. Inputs into the lake, comprising freshwaters (springs and the Jordan River) and saline springs gave a range of -0.37 parts per thousand to +1.0 parts per thousand with the freshwater sources being more enriched in delta(37)Cl. Based on the delta(37)Cl measurements of the End-Brine (the effluent from Dead Sea evaporation ponds) and of recent Dead Sea halite, the Cl isotopic composition of the originating brines have been estimated. They gave a narrow isotopic spread, +0.01 parts per thousand and +0.07 parts per thousand and fall within the same range with Dead Sea pore water (+0.13 parts per thousand) and with the post-overturn Dead Sea (-0.03 parts per thousand and +0.16 parts per thousand). Rock salt from Mount Sdom gave a value of -0.59 parts per thousand indicating its formation at the last stages of halite deposition from evaporating sea water. The hypersaline En Ashlag spring gave a depleted delta(37)Cl value of -0.32 parts per thousand, corresponding to a residual brine formed in the very latest stages (including bishofite deposition) of seawater evaporation.

Mercury in foliage did not behave similarly to eight other elements with known soil or aerosol sources (Aluminum (Al), Vanadium (V), Strontium (Sr), Rubidium (Rb), Copper (Cu), Zinc (Zn), Barium (Ba), and lead (Pb)), suggesting that Hg originated from a distinct pathway. Based on measured and modeled data, uptake of only 25% of the available ambient dry deposited Hg(0) could explain all of the Hg measured in foliage throughout the growing season. Estimates of gaseous elemental Hg (Hg(0)) uptake from soil water accounted for 3-14%% of the Hg in litterfall. Mercury deposition to forested sites in the Lake Champlain and Lake Huron basins was highest in litterfall (40%), followed by total throughfall (33%), and precipitation (27%). The Hg flux in litterfall was 15.8 +/-1.9 mug m(-2) yr(-1) to the Lake Champlain Watershed in 1995 and was 11.4 +/-2.8 mug m(-2) yr(-1) to the Lake Huron Watershed in 1996. In comparison, the Hg fluxes in precipitation and total throughfall were 9.0 +/-0.6 and 11.6 +/-0.7 mug m(-2) yr(-1) in the Lake Champlain Watershed (1995), and 8.7 +/-0.5 and 10.5 +/-1.0 mug m(-2) yr(-1) in the Lake Huron Watershed (1996).																			0049-6979					JAN	2002	133	1-4					49	67		10.1023/A:1012919731598	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1012919731598													WOS:000172385300004

It exhibits a potamodromous life cycle whereby adults, which reach up to 6 + years in age and over 350 mm in length, migrate into Clear Lake's ephemeral tributaries briefly during spring to spawn. Conservation and management of Clear Lake Hitch is inhibited, in part, by a lack of information on the lacustrine habitat of nonbreeding individuals within Clear Lake. To address this problem, we sampled Clear Lake Hitch with gill nets in a stratified random sampling design to determine the distribution and habitat associations in early summer 2017 and 2018. We identified abundance-habitat relationships for juveniles and adults using Bayesian zero-inflated negative binomial generalised linear mixed modelling. Results indicated that dissolved oxygen concentration was the most important habitat feature measured; juveniles and adults were substantially more abundant in normoxic (>= 2 mg/l) than in hypoxic (<2 mg/l) habitat. Both also exhibited weak positive relationships with chlorophyll fluorescence, suggesting relatively productive habitats may support higher numbers of Clear Lake Hitch. Spatially, juveniles were most abundant in nearshore habitats while adults were ubiquitous, indicating an ontogenetic habitat expansion that may be associated with a resource availability-predation risk trade-off. Management actions undertaken to improve hypoxia problems in Clear Lake would also improve Clear Lake Hitch habitat.

J	Romanov, AA				Romanov, A. A.			Ecological and Geographical Structure and Dynamics of Spring Migration of Passeriform Birds on the Putorana Plateau	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												The ecological and geographical differentiation and dynamics of the spring migration of passeriform birds from the Putorana Plateau are analyzed. In 1988-2007, eight points were surveyed in an area of 250000 km2. The route census method was used. There are 58 species in the fauna of the spring migration period. Birds fly along the shore forest-edge strip along rivers or lakes in the northern, western, and eastern directions. The bird population density is 179-332 individuals (on average 231 individuals/km2, n = 4). A significant amplitude of daily indicators of species abundance and asynchrony between phenological phenomena in different species and in individuals of the same species are characteristic. The time interval during which the first individuals usually appear is 4-12 days for different species and 6-9 days for most of the species (on average, 8 days). Early migrants, such as horned lark, white wagtail, and dusky thrush, usually appear on May 25-June 4, May 22-June 1, and May 27-June 2, respectively. Late migrants, such as sand martin, house martin, common chiffchaff, and arctic warbler, usually appear on June 7-16, June 7-16, June 5-11, and June 10-18, respectively. The average duration of the entire spring migration for most of the species is 9-12 days and the duration of their main migration is 4-6 days. The configuration of the spring migration course is a combination of two-three waves of varying strength, but always with one distinct maximum. Significant outbreaks of migratory activity of birds are observed on days with the lowest air temperature and precipitation in the form of snow or rain. The comparative nature of the spring migration of closely related species in different seasons varies from complete synchronization of the waves of maximum migration to their absolute discrepancy.																			1995-4255	1995-4263				OCT	2025	18	5					670	686		10.1134/S1995425525700362	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1995425525700362													WOS:001578278100012

It is considered that the induction of sporulation may be due to extreme conditions at the water surface to which the algal bloom is exposed during the summer, rather than to nutrient, especially orthophosphate, deficiency. It was not conclusively shown that akinetes constitute an overwintering stage of the planktonic algal life cycle, or that akinetes germinate in the spring to produce the inoculum for subsequent vegetative growth. Comparisons of planktonic, sedimenting and benthic algal material indicate that germination shortly after maturation may provide the greater part of the overwintering planktonic vegetative populations. Population sizes and life cycles appear to be influenced by the physical factors which control the stability of the water column.																			0080-4649						1977	196	1124					317	332		10.1098/rspb.1977.0043	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.1977.0043													WOS:A1977CZ63600005

Variations in the relative importance of the monsoon systems and the westerly jet are hypothesized to have occurred at decadal, millennial and glacial-interglacial scales. However, paleoclimate observations based on explicit climate proxies are still scarce, limiting our understanding of the mechanisms of Holocene climate variability on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Here we present three independently dated compound specific hydrogen isotope records of sedimentary leaf waxes from lakes on the TP, Bangong Co, Lake Qinghai and Linggo Co. The leaf wax delta D records reflect isotopes in precipitation, and we combine these observations with existing isotopic and hydrological data to investigate variations in the influence of the summer monsoon and the westerly jet on the moisture budget of the TP since the Late Pleistocene. delta D values of precipitation at all three lakes were relatively positive during the Late Pleistocene indicating a weakened summer monsoon. During the early and mid-Holocene, delta D values of precipitation at the three lakes were relatively negative, suggesting the importance of summer monsoon. During the middle to late Holocene, delta D values at Bangong Co and Lake Qinghai gradually increased with superimposed episodes of short term of delta D variability. However, at Linggo Co in the northern TP, periods of more positive delta D values of precipitation correspond to wetter intervals inferred from lake level high stands, and likely reflect variations in moisture associated with the westerly jet. Thus, the delta D records at Linggo Co imply the lesser importance of summer monsoon moisture in the hydrologic budget of the northern TP. Collectively, the hydrogen isotope records at these three lakes document millennial and centennial scale variations in the strength of the summer monsoon systems and concurrent changes in the westerly jet. Furthermore, millennial-scale fluctuations in the delta D records at the three lakes during the middle to late Holocene suggest episodes of reduced summer monsoonal moisture delivery to these regions, and correspond with intervals of cool sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic.

However, many processes related to calving are poorly understood since direct observations are scarce and challenging to obtain. When calving occurs at a glacier front, surface-water waves arise over the ocean or a lake in front of glaciers. To study calving processes from these surface waves, we performed field observations at Glaciar Perito Moreno, Patagonia. We synchronized time-lapse photography and surface waves record to confirm that glacier calving produces distinct waves compared with local noise. A total of 1074 calving events were observed over the course of 39 d. During austral summer, calving occurred twice more frequently than in spring. The cumulative distribution of calving-interevent time interval followed exponential model, implying random occurrence of events in time. We further investigated wave properties and found that source-to-sensor distance can be estimated from wave dispersion within similar to 20% error. We also found that waves produced by different calving types showed similar spectra in the same frequency range between 0.05-0.2 Hz, and that the amplitude of surface waves increased with the size of calving. This study demonstrates the potential of surface-wave monitoring for understanding calving processes.

This paper focuses on clusters of thermally unstable crystals believed to be the mineral ikaite (CaCO3. 6H(2)O) growing seasonally along two spring outflows at Colour Peak. This form of calcium carbonate mineral occurs along small sections of discharge outflow as white euhedral crystals up to 0.5 cm in length. Difficulty in sampling, storage and transport of the samples for analysis has hampered attempts to confirm the presence of ikaite by X-ray diffraction. However, various field observations and the remarkable instability of these crystals at normal ambient temperatures strengthens our argument. This paper provides a description of these particular CaCO3. 6H(2)O crystals and their environmental surroundings, and attempts to determine the validity of ikaite precipitation at this site by theoretical geochemical modeling: these results are compared with other reported observations of ikaite to both understand their occurrence and help delineate their geochemical characteristics. It is believed that the restrictive combination of spring water chemistry and long periods of low temperatures characteristic of arctic climates are necessary for ikaite growth at this site. The fact that ikaite is not forming at a second group of saline springs 11 km away allows us to more specifically outline conditions controlling its presence.

During spring and autumn the Grizzly Bears' main food was roots of Yellow Hedysarum (Hedysarum sulphurescens). During June through early August, Glacier Lily (Erythronium grandiflorum) corms and green vegetation (mainly Cow Parsnip (Heracleum lanatum) and other umbellifers) dominated the diet. Vaccinium spp. fruits ripened during late July and August and became an important food at that time. Minor use of animal matter was recorded. Most Yellow Hedysarum diggings were recorded on steep, dry, sparse meadows facing south through west. Colluvial soil and exposure into desiccating chinook wind characterized these digging sites. In contrast, most Glacier Lily and green vegetation feeding sites were on moist east-facing avalanche slopes supporting alder (Alnus viridis) thickets and tall-herb meadow communities. Vaccinium feeding habitat varied from relatively xeric, chinook-and/or wildlife-influenced slopes to forest understory and mesic avalanche slopes. These results are compared with the feeding ecology of Grizzly Bears from a more xeric portion of the Front Ranges.																			0008-3550					JUL-SEP	1991	105	3					325	329																WOS:A1991HF03500002

Under light stress caused by continuous illumination at elevated light intensity, strain BO 8808 ceased growth, the PE/chlorophyll ratio was slowly reduced and the zeaxanthin content was significantly decreased. By contrast, strain BO 9203 grew faster under high light compared to low light intensities. This strain responded to increased light by a rapid reduction of the PE/chlorophyll ratio while the zeaxanthin content remained constant. Both of these alterations may have protecting effects for BO 9203 against light toxicity. In mixtures of both strains, the predominance of the light-tolerant strain BO 9203 was demonstrated by restriction fragment length polymorphism of psbA genes under light stress conditions. Apparently, strain BO 9203, isolated from an algal bloom in the spring, can core better with high light intensities than strain BO 8808, isolated in the autumn.

J	Hillis, JJ; Garvey, JE; Lydy, MJ				Hillis, Jeffrey J.; Garvey, James E.; Lydy, Michael J.			Contaminants reduce male contribution to reproduction at the population scale	ECOSPHERE												In many populations, males compete for mates and contribute to genetic diversity, but are assumed to have little impact on population growth rates and density, because one father is all that is necessary to fertilize a large number of eggs and sire a potential cohort. A factor affecting male reproductive output is exposure to contaminants that either disrupt endocrine function or mimic hormones. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) persist in aquatic ecosystems and may interfere with the reproductive contribution of male fish to populations. We quantified 28 PCB congeners in adult male bluegills across eight Illinois lakes. In spring 2011 and 2012, mature male bluegills from lakes with conspecifics with PCB whole-body residues ranging from undetectable to high (2,000 ng/g dry mass total PCBs) were placed in experimental ponds with mature females containing no detectable PCB body residues and allowed to reproduce in spring under natural conditions. The presence of PCBs in fish had no effect on the presence of intersex or other gonadal deformities in adult males nor was gonad size, lipid concentration, and survival affected. Males with high PCBs were heavier than those from lakes with low PCB concentrations. The relative density of juvenile bluegills produced in ponds by fall, a fitness endpoint in this species, was negatively related to contaminant concentration in fathers. Contaminant exposure and other factors that affect male reproduction may not only suppress the relative contribution of males to genetic diversity, but also the overall density of cohorts within populations.

J	BATZLI, GO; HENTTONEN, H				BATZLI, GO; HENTTONEN, H			DEMOGRAPHY AND RESOURCE USE BY MICROTINE RODENTS NEAR TOOLIK LAKE, ALASKA, USA	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Five species of microtine rodents occurred in tundra near Toolik Lake, Alaska, but only tundra voles (Microtus oeconomus) and singing voles (M. miurus) were widespread and abundant. The relative abundance of these two species in different habitats corresponded to the availability of their preferred food items in each habitat. Tundra voles reached their highest densities (50 ha-1) in low, wet habitats dominated by rhizomatous monocotyledons and primarily ate monocotyledons. Singing voles reached similar densities in more mesic habitats that contained relatively high availability of dicotyledons and horsetails and mostly ate dicotyledons and horsetails. Although resource use differed, the demographies of the two species were remarkably similar. Both species of voles began breeding in the spring before snowmelt was complete and were still breeding when the first heavy snows occurred in autumn. However, tundra voles began breeding a few weeks earlier than singing voles, and singing voles had slightly larger litters than tundra voles (an average of 8.4 vs. 7.1 for adults, respectively). Population fluctuations appeared to be synchronous in the two species, which suggests control of their densities by similar environmental factors. The differences in food preference and habitat use suggest that competitive interactions between these species are weak and unlikely to be a major factor influencing their abundance.																			0004-0851					FEB	1990	22	1					51	64		10.2307/1551720	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1551720													WOS:A1990CQ32100005

Atlas of Ohio Aquatic Insects: Volume II, Plecoptera	BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL												Background We provide volume II of a distributional atlas of aquatic insects for the eastern USA state of Ohio. This treatment of stoneflies (Plecoptera) is companion to Armitage et al. (2011) on caddisflies (Trichoptera). We build on a recent analysis of Ohio stonefly diversity patterns based on large drainages (DeWalt et al. 2012), but add 3717 new records to the data set. We base most analyses on the United States Geological Survey Hierarchical Unit Code eight (HUC8) drainage scale. In addition to distributional maps for each species, we provide analyses of species richness versus HUC8 drainage area and the number of unique locations in a HUC8 drainage, species richness versus Ohio counties, analyze adult presence phenology throughout the year, and demonstrate stream size range affiliation for each species. New information This work is based on a total of 7797 specimen records gathered from 21 regional museums, agency data, personal collections, and from the literature Table 1. To our knowledge this is the largest stonefly data set available for a similarly sized geopolitical area anywhere in the world. These data are made available as a Darwin Core Archive supported by the Pensoft Integrated Publishing Toolkit (DeWalt et al. 2016b). All known published papers reporting stoneflies from Ohio are detailed in Suppl. material 1. We recovered 102 species from Ohio, including all nine Nearctic families Table 2. Two species were removed from the DeWalt et al. (2012) list and two new state records added. Perlidae (32 spp.) was most speciose, compared to the low diversity Pteronarcyidae (2 spp.) and Peltoperlidae (1 sp.). The richest HUC8 drainages occurred in northeastern, south-central, and southern regions of the state where drainages were heavily forested, had the highest slopes, and were contained within or adjacent to the unglaciated Allegheny and Appalachian Plateaus. Species poor drainages occurred mainly in the northwestern region where Wisconsinan aged lake plains climaxed to an expansive wooded wetland, the Black Swamp. The unglaciated Lower Scioto drainage (72 spp.) in south-central Ohio supported the greatest species richness. There was no relationship between species richness and HUC8 drainage size, but the number of unique locations in a drainage strongly related to species richness. All Ohio counties were represented in the data set with Hocking County (59 spp.) of the Lower Scioto drainage being the richest and most heavily sampled. Adult presence phenology was influenced by phylogenetic relationships such that the superfamily Nemouroidea (Capniidae, Leuctridae, Nemouridae, and Taeniopterygidae) generally emerged in winter and spring while the superfamilies Pteronarcyoidea (Pteronarcyidae, Peltoperlidae) and Perloidea (Chloroperlidae, Perlidae, Perlodidae) emerged later, some species continuing emergence through summer months. Species often occupied specific stream size ranges, while others were generalists. Two species once histrorically abundant in the western Lake Erie Bass Islands no longer reside there. Each of the 102 species is discussed in detail, including several that require additional collecting efforts to confirm their identities, presence, and distribution in Ohio.

Plume aerosols were sampled during horizontal and vertical passes using a DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft, which typically tracked the plume up to 30 km from the stack. Samples of the 'background' atmospheric conditions were taken simultaneously from a ground site meteorological station located 2.5 km in the predominant upwind direction from the stack. Overall, metal concentrations (ng/m(3) of As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Se, Zn) for the in-plume samples are elevated by one or more orders of magnitude over those measured in the ground site samples. The Pb isotope compositions for the in-plume samples are extremely variable (Pb-206/Pb-207 range from similar to1.120 to similar to1.170) but define well-constrained linear arrays in conventional Pb-Pb isotope plots. Correlations between metal concentrations (e.g. As/Pb, Cu/Pb, Zn/Pb) and the Pb isotope data are indicative of binary mixing between two anthropogenic end members; most probably imported industrial Pb found in recycled materials, and nonradiogenic Pb derived from Archean sulfide ore deposits. Pb isotope data from the winter ground site ('background') samples indicate that the ground level atmosphere at Rouyn contains a mixture of Pb emitted from the Home smelter and long-range anthropogenic Pb transported from Eurasian pollution sources. Compared to the Pb isotope composition of epiphytic lichens, snowpack, and precipitations collected in 1990 to 1999 from adjacent geographic regions, the Pb isotope results obtained here suggest that aerosols emitted from the Home smelter are dispersed into northeastern North America. However, future studies dealing with point source apportionment for this region of the globe will be rendered difficult due to the processing at the Home smelter of recycled material containing industrial Pb from various sources.

A multi-basin approach determines variability in host fish suitability for unionids in tributaries of the Laurentian Great Lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Freshwater mussel populations have declined, in part, from changes in host communities. However, it is unknown if fish from adjacent catchments could be used to augment mussel populations in the Great Lakes inland rivers, and if so, whether this association would be impacted by known genetic structure in mussels and fish. This study tested how host fish origin (i.e. catchment) impacts the transformation of the endangered unionid Epioblasma triquetra from larval into juvenile life stages while concurrently considering potentially genetically distinct populations of mussels and hosts. We quantitatively determined if Percina caprodes and Percina maculata from the Lake Michigan, Erie and Huron basins are laboratory-successful hosts for E. triquetra. Experiments were performed in autumn and spring to document any seasonal effects on transformation.Percina caprodes was reconfirmed to be a successful host for E. triquetra, and for the first time, P.maculata was also determined to be a successful host in the Great Lakes region. Results suggest no differences in juvenile transformation with allopatric and sympatric fish and mussel pairings based on Great Lakes basin origin; therefore, transformation success may not parallel differences in genetic structure. In addition, results suggest seasonal differences in the developmental stages of E. triquetra juveniles. Knowing the most efficient strategy to optimise juvenile transformations can make reintroductions, augmentation and overall conservation efforts of E. triquetra successful. These data will help in developing recovery strategies for E. triquetra in the Laurentian Great Lakes by understanding variation in host use and nuances in this host-parasite relationship.					; Zanatta, David/AAR-6797-2020	Zanatta, David/0000-0002-3174-071X; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				JUL	2016	61	7					1035	1048		10.1111/fwb.12756	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12756													WOS:000377223300001

We described the seasonal, spatial and diel dynamics of the peak, and tested the likelihood of several hypotheses to explain the mechanism of formation of the peak and the factors controlling the actual depth of the peak. The metalimnetic peak generally accounted for >60% of the lake phytoplanktonic biomass. Cryptomonas phaseolus was shown to be active at depth, growing at the metalimnion during the spring and remaining there, in a dynamic equilibrium where losses balanced production, through the stratification period. The upper limit of sulfide distribution delimited the exact depth of the peak at noon hours. The peak did not move following optimal light intensities; rather, it followed the depth oscillations of the oxygen-sulfide interface. Low sulfide concentrations were apparently tolerated and the protist moved inside the sulfide-rich part of the lake at night and during the winter. Metalimnetic algal populations behave differently from epilimnetic ones. A single species accounts for most of the biomass and production, and persists during all the stratification period. This indicates that the mechanisms currently believed to account for succession (competition and predation) do not operate efficiently in metalimnetic peaks.					; Pedrós-Alió, Carlos/H-1222-2011; Pedros-Alio, Carlos/H-1222-2011; Gasol, Josep M/B-1709-2008; Gasol, Josep/B-1709-2008	Guerrero, Ricardo/0000-0001-5019-9933; Pedros-Alio, Carlos/0000-0003-1009-4277; Gasol, Josep M/0000-0001-5238-2387; 													0142-7873					NOV	1992	14	11					1565	1579		10.1093/plankt/14.11.1565	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/14.11.1565													WOS:A1992JZ54000006

The Crocodile River contributed over 80% of the hydraulic load and over 97% of the annual total nitrogen load to the impoundment. More than 80% of this nitrogen load was composed of nitrate. Monthly measurements of nitrification and denitrification rats carried out within the impoundment over one annual cycle revealed that the rates of both processes were highest at the ammonia-oxygen chemocline during summer stratification and at the sediment-water interface during winter isothermy. Mass balance calculations showed that between 35 and 49% of the annual total nitrogen load were lost via denitrification each year; the data are compared with those in the literature. Conditions in the lake will favour a change in phytoplankton species composition from Microcystis to a nitrogen-fixing species if the present trend of decreasing inorganic nitrogen concentrations and N:P ratios is maintained.																			0377-9688					JUN	1985	11	1					32	42		10.1080/03779688.1985.9633108	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03779688.1985.9633108													WOS:A1985AYQ5600008

Sinninghe; Schouten, Stefan			Sources and seasonality of long-chain diols in a temperate lake (Lake Geneva)	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Long-chain diols (LCDs) are lipids commonly found in freshwater environments. They are produced in lake waters and in low water-flow regions of rivers but their sources and the controls on their abundance are poorly constrained. To be able to use LCD as environmental proxy (e.g. for reconstructing lake temperature and as a freshwater indicator in marine systems) we need to understand the sources of these LCDs and the processes controlling their abundance and distribution. Therefore, we performed a seasonal study of suspended particulate matter in Lake Geneva, a temperate lake at the border of France and Switzerland in 2017-2018. LCDs were most abundant in lake surface water from late spring to early autumn, coinciding with the thermal stratification of the water column. Their distribution varied throughout the year, which points towards multiple producers. Incubation of lake water with C-13-labelled bicarbonate only showed uptake of inorganic carbon in LCDs during their peak seasonal abundance. An 18S rRNA gene amplicon analysis revealed that eustigmatophytes, known producers of LCDs, are present in Lake Geneva and show the same seasonal trend in abundance as the LCDs, indicating that these algae are likely the most important producers of LCDs in this lake.

J	Cuthbert, MO; Ashley, GM				Cuthbert, Mark O.; Ashley, Gail M.			A Spring Forward for Hominin Evolution in East Africa	PLOS ONE												Groundwater is essential to modern human survival during drought periods. There is also growing geological evidence of springs associated with stone tools and hominin fossils in the East African Rift System (EARS) during a critical period for hominin evolution (from 1.8 Ma). However it is not known how vulnerable these springs may have been to climate variability and whether groundwater availability may have played a part in human evolution. Recent interdisciplinary research at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, has documented climate fluctuations attributable to astronomic forcing and the presence of paleosprings directly associated with archaeological sites. Using palaeogeological reconstruction and groundwater modelling of the Olduvai Gorge paleo-catchment, we show how spring discharge was likely linked to East African climate variability of annual to Milankovitch cycle timescales. Under decadal to centennial timescales, spring flow would have been relatively invariant providing good water resource resilience through long droughts. For multi-millennial periods, modelled spring flows lag groundwater recharge by 100 s to 1000 years. The lag creates long buffer periods allowing hominins to adapt to new habitats as potable surface water from rivers or lakes became increasingly scarce. Localised groundwater systems are likely to have been widespread within the EARS providing refugia and intense competition during dry periods, thus being an important factor in natural selection and evolution, as well as a vital resource during hominin dispersal within and out of Africa.

Thus, it is considered as a hub of bacterial diversity. In this study, bacterial diversity in the sediment of Crescent Moon Spring, Kumtag Desert, Northwest China was analyzed using high-throughput amplicon pyrosequencing analysis. The sequences of the most abundant OUTs (Operational Taxonomic Units) in the sediment of Crescent Moon Spring were compared with the sequences of those most abundant OUTs of various origins from NCBI GenBank database to detect the origins of bacteria in the sediment of Crescent Moon Spring. Also, bacterial compositions between sediment of Crescent Moon Spring and other desert and lake ecosystems (including desert lakes) worldwide were compared using cluster analysis to determine the possible factors affecting bacterial compositions. In total, 11,855 sequences were obtained and 30 phyla were identified. At the phylum level, the dominant phylum was Proteobacteria with alpha-Proteobacteria being the first dominant class and the second dominant phylum was Planctomycetes. Our finding that alpha-Proteobacteria being the first dominant class of Proteobacteria and Planctomycetes being the second dominant phyla are somewhat contradictory with reports from other desert lake sediments. This difference could be resulted from water hydration and conductivity, as well as oligotrophic conditions of Crescent Moon Spring. At the genus level, Rhodobacter, Caldilinea, Planctomyces, and Porphyrobacter were the dominant genera in the sediment of Crescent Moon Spring. Comparisons on sequences of the most abundant OUTs (including OTU3615, OTU6535, and OTU6646) between sediment of Crescent Moon Spring and various origins from NCBI GenBank database indicate that the origins of bacteria in the sediment of Crescent Moon Spring are likely from the underground water. Furthermore, cluster analysis on comparisons of bacteria compositions between sediment of Crescent Moon Spring and other desert and lake ecosystems (including desert lakes) worldwide shows that at regional scales, bacterial compositions may be mainly affected by geographical patterns, precipitation amounts, and pH values. Collectively, our results provide new knowledge on the bacterial diversity in desert lake ecosystems.

Caribou, water, and ice - fine-scale movements of a migratory arctic ungulate in the context of climate change	MOVEMENT ECOLOGY												Background: Freshwater lakes and rivers of the Northern Hemisphere have been freezing increasingly later and thawing increasingly earlier during the last century. With reduced temporal periods during which ice conditions are favourable for locomotion, freshwater bodies could become impediments to the inter-patch movements, dispersion, or migration of terrestrial animals that use ice-covered lakes and rivers to move across their range. Studying the fine-scale responses of individuals to broad-scale changes in ice availability and phenology would help to understand how animals react to ongoing climate change, and contribute to the conservation and management of endangered species living in northern environments. Between 2007 and 2014, we equipped 96 migratory caribou Rangifer tarandus caribou from the RiviSre-aux-Feuilles herd in northern Quebec (Canada) with GPS telemetry collars and studied their space use. We measured contemporary (digital MODIS maps updated every 8 days, 2000-2014) and historical (annual observations, 1947-1985) variations in freshwater-ice availability and evaluated the concurrent responses of caribou to these changes. Results: Ice had a positive influence on caribou movement rates and directionality, and caribou selected ice and avoided water when moving across or in the vicinity of large water bodies. When ice was unavailable, caribou rarely swam across (6 % of crossings) and frequently circumvented water bodies for several km. Although ice phenology did not change significantly during our study, climate projections indicated that ice availability could decrease considerably before the end of the century, generating a similar to 28 % increase in distance travelled by caribou during the early spring and fall migrations. Conclusions: We demonstrated that ice availability influenced the movements of a migratory arctic ungulate. Warmer air temperatures in the Arctic will undoubtedly modify the phenology of ice forming on freshwater lakes and rivers. If migratory caribou are unable to adjust the timing of their migrations, they could be forced to circumvent unfrozen water bodies more frequently and over broader areas, which may increase the distance, time, and energy they use to reach wintering areas. The long-term conservation of wide-ranging species will ultimately depend on our ability to identify the fine-scale behavioural reactions of individuals to broad-scale changes in climate and land use.					; Leblond, Mathieu/J-9646-2019	Leblond, Mathieu/0000-0002-2833-6265; 													2051-3933					APR 20	2016	4								14	10.1186/s40462-016-0079-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40462-016-0079-4								27099756					WOS:000381933500001

Cryogenic formation of brine and sedimentary mirabilite in submergent coastal lake basins, Canadian Arctic	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Two informally named basins (Mirabilite Basins 1 and 2) along a submergent coastline on Banks Island, Canadian Arctic Archipelago, host up to 1 m-thick accumulations of mirabilite (Na2SO4.10H(2)O) underlying stratified water bodies with basal anoxic brines. Unlike isostatically uplifting coastlines that trap seawater in coastal basins, these basins formed from freshwater lakes that were transgressed by seawater. The depth of the sill that separates the basins from the sea is shallow (1.15 m), such that seasonal sea ice formation down to 1.6 m isolates the basins from open water exchange through the winter. Freezing of seawater excludes salts, generating dense brines that sink to the basin bottom. Progressive freezing increases salinity of residual brines to the point of mirabilite saturation, and as a result sedimentary deposits of mirabilite accumulate on the basin floors. Brine formation also leads to density stratification and bottom water anoxia. We propose a model whereby summer melt of the ice cover forms a temporary freshwater lens, and rather than mixing with the underlying brines, it is exchanged with seawater once the ice plug that separates the basins from the open sea melts. This permits progressive brine development and density stratification within the basins. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Two new genera and species of chiltoniid amphipods (Crustacea: Amphipoda: Talitroidea) from freshwater mound springs in South Australia	ZOOTAXA												Amphipods within the family Chiltoniidae are an abundant yet taxonomically poorly known member of Australian freshwater habitats. With only four species known from Australia, the group is inadequately defined and marked by taxonomists as difficult to identify. Recent molecular analyses of chiltoniids from mound springs in South Australia detected several distinct species, prompting a morphological revision of material from the central and southern Lake Eyre region. Clear groups defined by unique combinations of morphological characters (focusing on uropodal, coxal, male gnathopod 2, and antennal morphology) were found that closely correlated with clades found in the molecular analyses. Arabunnachiltonia n. gen. is established for A. murphyi n. sp. from Strangways Springs in South Australia. Wangiannachiltonia n. gen. is established for W. guzikae n. sp. from Davenport Springs in South Australia. The chiltoniid genera are discussed and a key is presented to the known Australian species.					; King, Rachael/C-3821-2012	King, Rachael/0000-0001-8089-7599; 													1175-5326	1175-5334				NOV 19	2009		2293					35	52		10.11646/zootaxa.2293.1.2	http://dx.doi.org/10.11646/zootaxa.2293.1.2													WOS:000271902300002

Crustacean species richness has declined, large-bodied Cladocera have replaced small-bodied ones, and there has been a downward trend in the total abundance of zooplankton because copepod abundance has remained stable while Cladoceran abundance has declined. Although the zooplankton community has now been stable for 4 years (1995-1998), the biology of the invader has changed dramatically. In particular, there have been 10-fold differences in the mean annual abundance of Bythotrephes in this 5-year period and substantial changes in the timing of population maxima. We attribute these changes to two factors: (i) transition from a summer to a fall switch from parthenogenesis to gametogenesis and (ii) interannual differences in the thickness of a warm, dark stratum in the lake. We hypothesize that this stratum provides a refuge for Bythotrephes from predation by lake herring, Coregonus artedii.					; Yan, Norman/H-5235-2013	Yan, Norman/0000-0003-4870-6865; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				DEC	2001	58	12					2341	2350		10.1139/cjfas-58-12-2341	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-58-12-2341													WOS:000172825400004

D.; Hedman, Matthew M.; Lucas, Antoine; Rodriguez, Sebastien; Turtle, Elizabeth P.; Sotin, Christophe			The case for seasonal surface changes at Titan's lake district	NATURE ASTRONOMY												Titan, Saturn's largest moon, hosts lakes and seas of liquid hydrocarbons at its poles(1). General circulation models demonstrate that regional evaporation and precipitation rates of methane are likely to change with the seasons (Titan's year is 29.5 Earth years) and evolve on a geological timescale (similar to 10(5) Earth years)(2-4). Cassini observations suggest shoreline recession at a few south polar lakes during local summer(5), but similar seasonal changes have yet to be observed at the north pole where lakes are larger and more numerous(6,7). We present three 'phantom lakes' that appear to be north polar surface liquids in winter observations by Cassini RADAR but that are inconsistent with lakes in infrared images obtained up to seven years later, after vernal equinox, suggesting that the liquids were removed in between. If this were the case, the phantom lakes could be interpreted as shallow ponds, with either a pure methane composition or a regolith porous enough to remove the less volatile ethane. These phantom lakes provide observational constraints on removal timescales for surface liquids at Titan's north pole. The location, size and longevity of surface liquid reservoirs affect sediment processing(7), seasonal weather(8), climate evolution(9), and even, perhaps, their habitability(10). As solubility of the possible non-polar mixtures is generally low, short-lived lakes might be nutrient-poor(10) and thus have low astrobiological potential.

J	Jehl, JR Jr; Johansson, C				Jehl, JR Jr; Johansson, C			Autumnal migration of Eared Grebes (Podiceps nigricollis) through southwestern Wyoming: A key to assessing the size of the North American population	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												In autumn the vast majority of the North American population of Eared Grebes (Podiceps nigricollis) congregates for several months at Great Salt Lake, Utah, and Mono Lake, California. Because the lakes are so large, it has not been possible to monitor grebe migration with sufficient accuracy to determine when peak numbers are reached. To clarify migration phenology, we analyzed data from 2 isolated wetland areas in southwestern Wyoming where grebes land en route between breeding areas in the interior and Great Salt Lake. Occasional birds, probably non-breeders or failed breeders, begin moving southward as early as mid-June. Migration of postbreeding birds starts in late July, peaks in late August and September, and is largely completed by the end of October, with very small numbers arriving into,November. The pattern of migration and number of birds encountered varied annually, but 95% of the migration was usually completed by 15 October. As a result, censuses at the major staging lake made on or after 15 October but before the grebes depart for wintering areas can be used to study trends in size of the North American population.																			1527-0904	1944-8341				JUL	2002	62	3					335	340																WOS:000177468200009
J	LIAO, CFH; LEAN, DRS				LIAO, CFH; LEAN, DRS			SEASONAL-CHANGES IN NITROGEN COMPARTMENTS OF LAKES UNDER DIFFERENT LOADING CONDITIONS	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												To develop a better conceptual picture for N dynamics in lake ecosystems, the seasonal changes in the concentrations of nitrate, ammonia, dissolved organic and particulate N were monitored in the water contained in 3 limnocorrals located in the Bay of Quinte, Ontario [Canada]. Following the decline in summer particulate N, there was an increase in ammonia. This was followed by an increase in nitrate throughout the winter suggesting that nitrification was a significant process. To assess the potential contribution of the sediments, ammonia, nitrate and dissolved organic N were measured for pore waters and total N, exchangeable ammonia, and nitrate in the solid fraction. The influence of nutrient addition was evaluated by comparing corral I, receiving no nutrient additions with corral II to which phosphate was added (0.92 g P/m2 per yr) and corral III which received the same amount of phosphate plus nitrate at an N:P weight ratio of 13. Increases and decreases in P, N and chlorophyll a seemed to take place in all 3 corrals at the same time. There was a considerable delay in the response to nutrient enrichment, but the addition of nitrate and phosphate eventually resulted in a chlorophyll a level greater than that for phosphate enrichment alone. The importance of sediments as a net source of N for the planktonic community was insignificant, but the flux rate for N to the and from the sediment was important. During the summer an input-output budget showed that nitrate loading plus N2 fixation was approximately equal to the net change in the total combined N in the water. This implied that denitrification was not important, but over 12 mo. most of the N that entered the system was lost; hence denitrification must be important at certain times. A lake ecosystem tends to compensate for low or high levels of NO3 loading. Without the addition of N the requirement was partly met through N fixation and this can be enhanced by P enrichment.																									1978	35	8					1095	1101		10.1139/f78-173	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f78-173													WOS:A1978FG41200005

Accurately determining the start and end times of the rainy season on the Plateau remains challenging. This study determined the start and end times of the rainy season in different locations on the Plateau by identifying precipitation inflection points. We calculated the duration and precipitation amount of the rainy season and established a transfer function between the modern pollen assemblages and them. Then, we reconstructed the rainy season variations in Kusai Lake (northern TP) and Jiang Co (central TP) during the past two millennia. The results showed that, the rainy season precipitation in Kusai Lake recorded five periods of high precipitation: AD 580-680, 1000-1100, 1200-1450, 1550-1780, and 1920-present, corresponding to the stages with long rainy season. The rainy season precipitation sequence in Jiang Co recorded four periods of high precipitation: AD 80-500, 800-950, 1250-1450, and 1780-present, which is consistent with the long rainy season before AD 1000 but unclear afterward. Spatially, rainy season precipitation on the Plateau exhibited four patterns: "wet in both north and south" may be related to abnormally strong summer monsoons; "dry in both north and south" likely associated with weak Westerly wind and weak summer monsoon; "wet in the south and dry in the north" linked to strong summer monsoon and weak Westerly wind; and "dry in the south and wet in the north" connected to weak summer monsoon and strong Westerly wind. This study revealed the spatiotemporal evolution pattern of the rainy season onset and end, duration, and precipitation amount on the Plateau over the past two millennia. It provides natural background support for further understanding the coupling between Westerly wind and Asian summer monsoon.

During the whole period the community was composed of 15 species of Rotifera, 9 of Cladocera, 2 of Copepoda and 1 of Chaoboridae. A period of total zooplankton depression occurred in the winter-spring seasons. Temperature may influence zooplankton fluctuations directly as a triggering factor, or indirectly through its influence on the phytoplankton. Through-flow does not seem to induce seasonal variation, as high zooplankton densities were found in the wet season. Predation by Chaoboridae can exert an influence on some populations, such as Daphnia gessneri, Bosmina tubicen, and Keratella cochlearis micracantha, mainly in the wet-warm season, when the larvae are abundant. Daphnia gessneri was a superior competitor over rotifers and other cladocerans, such as Diaphanosoma birgei, Moina micrura and possibly Ceriodaphnia cornuta. Clutch size variation of D. gessneri and B. tubicen indicated food limitation in the dry-cool season. Fluctuations of the populations can be seasonal or non seasonal depending on the factors involved. Size and species composition were possibly related to a higher predation pressure by Chaoboridae, suitable phytoplankton composition and biomass, and interspecific competition.																			0003-9136					FEB	1992	123	4					479	495																WOS:A1992HE51200008

The annual external loading was 7.7 gm(-2) y(-1) of total nitrogen (TN) and 0.2 gm(-2) y(-1) of total phosphorus (TP), including 7% of both inputs as direct atmospheric precipitation. The external budget revealed a retention of 53% of TN and 28% of TP annual input. About 80% of the total loss of nitrogen was accounted for by denitrification (3.3 gm(-2) y(-1)) and only 20% was buried into the sediment. Wind-induced sediment resuspension played the major role in the upward nutrient flux formation and, thus, in the formation of the temporal pattern of nutrient concentration during the ice-free season. Other fluxes as the external loading or new sedimentation of autochthonous production were overcome and masked by the powerful resuspension - sedimentation cycle, exceeding the former by one or two orders of magnitude. The intensity of upward flux of nutrients (mainly caused by resuspension) increased in accordance to decreasing water level in autumn and correlated with the weekly average wind speed. The summer population of filamentous blue-greens dominated by Limnothrix redekei was light-limited until the minima of TN:TP ratio (<10) and DIN:TN ratio (similar to 0) in July initiated a clear peak of N-2-fixing algae (Aphanizomenon gracile, Anabaena spp.) which lasted until September.

J	Lieberherr, G; Wunderle, S				Lieberherr, Gian; Wunderle, Stefan			Lake Surface Water Temperature Derived from 35 Years of AVHRR Sensor Data for European Lakes	REMOTE SENSING												Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is an important parameter with which to assess aquatic ecosystems and to study the lake's response to climate change. The AVHRR archive of the University of Bern offers great potential to derive consistent LSWT data suited for the study of climate change and lake dynamics. To derive such a dataset, challenges such as orbit drift correction, non-water pixel detection, and homogenization had to be solved. The result is a dataset covering over 3.5 decades of spatial LSWT data for 26 European lakes. The validation against in-situ temperature data at 19 locations showed an uncertainty between +/- 0.8 K and +/- 2.0 K (standard deviation), depending on locations of the lakes. The long-term robustness of the dataset was confirmed by comparing in-situ and satellite derived temperature trends, which showed no significant difference. The final trend analysis showed significant LSWT warming trends at all locations (0.2 K/decade to 0.8 K/decade). A gradient of increasing trends from south-west to north-east of Europe was revealed. The strong intra-annual variability of trends indicates that single seasonal trends do not well represent the response of a lake to climate change, e.g., autumn trends are dominant in the north of Europe, whereas winter trends are dominant in the south. Intra-lake variability of trends indicates that trends at single in-situ stations do not necessarily represent the lake's response. The LSWT dataset generated for this study gives some new and interesting insights into the response of European lakes to climate change during the last 36 years (1981-2016).

The dataset used comprised a one-year time series of weekly samples analysed by non-destructive image analysis techniques from the pico- to mesoplankton size range. The resulting model suggested that, for the overall size range, the biovolume increased with individual body size by a factor of approximately 2 if the classical size ranges from pico, nano-, micro- and mesoplankton were considered Two antagonistic types of spectra were used to illustrate different configurations of the food web, the first with a volumetric autotroph-heterotroph ratio slightly higher than 1 (A:H = 1.02), the second largely dominated by heterotrophs (A:H = 0.02). The density spectra slope from the nano- to mesoplankton size range followed a seasonal trend, showing more negative values in late summer (September) and less negative values in winter Both the variability range of the slope and the seasonal trend were lessened when considering the picoplankton size range, suggesting that the microbial compartment plays a relevant role in the configuration of the food web in the lagoon.

J	Lepage, S; Biberhofer, J; Lorrain, S				Lepage, S; Biberhofer, J; Lorrain, S			Sediment dynamics and the transport of suspended matter in the upstream area of Lake St. Francis	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												A long-term project was initiated in autumn 1994 to monitor the suspended matter (SM) in the upstream area of Lake St. Francis. Over a 32-month period, 190 SM samples were collected at six study sites while conductivity and current velocity measurements were made to study resuspension and transport of SM. Weather data from a nearby station and daily discharge rates for the St. Lawrence River were also utilised. Overall, the study shows that the SM load in the central portion of Lake St. Francis is not evenly distributed. On the northern side of the lake, the SM load is mainly a function of the SM load carried by the Sr. Lawrence River waters coming from the Great Lakes. On the southern side, an important contribution to the SM load comes from sediment resuspension and from the local tributaries. Calculations show that wave action is likely to resuspend surficial sediments in depths shallower than 2 m, a surface area estimated to be 32-35 km(2) between Cornwall Island and Thompson Basin. Also, important fluctuations of the south shore tributaries' winter discharge are thought to contribute to sediment resuspension and redistribution of contaminants such as mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					2000	57			1			52	62		10.1139/cjfas-57-S1-52	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-57-S1-52													WOS:000086580300006

The annual average proportion of active cells was similar to 47% and changed from similar to 17% in winter to 100% in autumn. Both total direct counts (range: 1.5 to 20.4 x 10(6) ml(-1)) and abundance of active cells (range: 0.4 to 6.0 x 10(6) ml(-1)) varied annually by 14-fold and were highly correlated (r = 0.74, p < 0.001). Bacterial activity, based on [C-14]leucine uptake, was more strongly correlated with active bacterial abundance (r = 0.83, p < 0.001) than with total bacterial counts (r = 0.70, p < 0.001). Water temperature explained similar to 81% of the temporal variability of active bacterial abundance but only 55% of total bacterial numbers. Chlorophyll a concentration (range: 99 to 335 mu g l(-1)) was only weakly correlated to the abundance of active bacteria (r = 0.34, p < 0.05). Compared with data from other freshwater systems, our results show that although in this lake the average proportion of active bacteria was higher, their absolute abundance was lower than in less enriched systems.

The system was applied in a wood demonstration house within the Lake Tai climate zone of Suzhou, China. The hygrothermal performance of the cavity insulation wall was determined from the temperature, relative humidity, and from the temperature of the wood material surface throughout the year. The results clearly indicated the effect of the cavity insulation, cladding cavity ventilation, and air-vapor barrier. Thermal performance was very good due to the wall cavity insulation. Cladding cavity ventilation was effective at low relative humidity of the insulated wall cavities. Condensation and mold growth were not found inside the wall during the test period. The wood frame wall system had good hygrothermal performance and may be widely used in hot summer and cold winter climate zones in China.																			1930-2126						2013	8	3					4702	4710																WOS:000323370400119

Different dynamics were found among phytoplankton, zooplankton, and zoobenthos in terms of density, biomass, and biodiversity. On an annual time scale and with deterioration of water quality, density and biomass of plankton and zoobenthos showed different variations, while phytoplankton (density, biomass, and biodiversity) changed significantly when water quality improved. On a seasonal time scale, density and biomass of phytoplankton showed significant differences between spring and summer. Results of Pearson's correlation analysis revealed that phytoplankton, zooplankton, and zoobenthos were significantly affected by different environmental factors. Our study demonstrated that phytoplankton was more sensitive to water quality changes than zooplankton and zoobenthos. These results suggest that density and biomass of phytoplankton could rapidly reflect water quality, whereas biodiversity of phytoplankton could indicate long-term status of water quality combined with the physico-chemical parameters of water. The results could contribute to predicting the dynamics of plankton and zoobenthos in freshwater lakei and to selecting effective bio-indicators for ecosystem health assessment of freshwater lakes.

We present sub-centennial-scale records of summer temperature and summer precipitation hydrogen isotope ratios (& delta;H-2) spanning 12-7 ka from a lake on Baffin Island. In a transient model simulation, winds in this region were controlled by the relative strength of the high-pressure systems and associated anticyclonic circulation over the retreating Greenland and Laurentide ice sheets. The correlation between summer temperature and precipitation & delta;H-2 proxy records changed from negative to positive at 9.8 ka. This correlation structure indicates a shift from alternating local and remote moisture, governed by the two ice-sheet high-pressure systems, to only remote moisture after 9.8 ka, governed by the strong Greenland high-pressure system after the Laurentide Ice Sheet retreated. Such rapid atmospheric circulation changes may also occur in response to future, gradual ice-sheet retreat.					; McKay, Nicholas/JYQ-5440-2024; Lindberg, Kurt/LZE-2835-2025; briner, jason/JDM-4641-2023	Corcoran, Megan/0000-0001-9608-2204; Lindberg, Kurt/0000-0003-0863-1598; Cluett, Allison/0000-0001-7561-0557; Thomas, Elizabeth/0000-0002-6489-7123; Castaneda, Isla/0000-0002-2524-9326; Erb, Michael/0000-0002-1187-952X; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				JUL 16	2023	50	13							e2023GL103428	10.1029/2023GL103428	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023GL103428													WOS:001022457300001

To date, however, few studies have been conducted on investigating the isotope characteristics and moisture sources of precipitation in arid desert environments. The Alxa Desert Plateau is a critical arid desert area in North China. This study is the first to analyse the stable isotopic composition of precipitation to identify the sources of atmospheric moisture over this plateau. Our results show that the D and O-18 values of precipitation across the plateau change greatly at both daily and monthly timescales, and exhibit seasonal variations. Among the main meteorological parameters, atmospheric temperature is the most predominant factor controlling the isotopic composition and the D-O-18 relationship of local precipitation. Analyses of the precipitation isotopes with the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model reveal that (a) the westerly and polar moisture sources are the dominant controls on summer and winter precipitation and (b) the evaporation of local lake water significantly affects winter precipitation even though it only represents a small amount. Based on the isotope data of 2013-2016 precipitation, a local meteoric water line (LMWL) is derived: D=(8.20 +/- 0.22)O-18+(8.15 +/- 2.16)parts per thousand for the study site. Compared to the global meteoric water line, the LMWL has a greater slope and lower d-excess. This can be explained by admixing of atmospheric moisture resulting from the evaporation of local lake water. Based on this LMWL, we are able to trace that groundwater of the Badain Jaran Desert originates from the surrounding mountains with altitudes of <4,000m. The newly derived LMWL shows that the recharge altitudes of desert groundwater are overestimated on the basis of the previous LMWLs. This study not only provides insights into the hydrological cycle but also offers guidance for water resource management in arid desert areas of China. Additionally, this study provides techniques that can be applied to the analyses of precipitation isotopes in similar arid regions of the world.					bin, yong/GLS-8007-2022; Rao, Wenbo/AAE-5251-2019; Tan, Hongbing/AFW-6778-2022	Meredith, Karina.

The study revealed an unexpected diversity of bird species, for which we provide the population size, with their variations, over five years (2017-2018 to 2022-2023). Among these birds, we found four remarkable species: Oxyura leucocephala (endangered), Aythya ferina (vulnerable), Aythya nyroca (near-threatened) and Limosa limosa (near-threatened). In addition, we illustrated the wetland changes during the last 20 years (2003-2023), mainly the habitat loss for wintering waterbirds.Abstract Moroccan wetlands host up to half a million wintering birds and provide a stopover for tens of thousands of migrants, while they are inhabited by few nesting species. Most of this avifauna prefers to use the large coastal wetlands or reservoirs, while many species are dispersed across hundreds of small inland wetlands of various types. In this study, we monitored the wintering avifauna of 11 wetlands of the Sa & iuml;ss plain and its adjacent Atlas Mountains (north-center of Morocco), during six wintering seasons (2017-2018 to 2022-2023), with the objective of assessing the importance of this region as a waterbird wintering area. Using the richness of the species, we determine the bird population changes during this pentad and between the different types of wetlands (natural, human-made, and natural wetlands). During this study, we recorded 51 species, belonging to 17 families, among which exist four remarkable birds: the endangered Oxyura leucocephala, the vulnerable Aythya ferina and the near-threatened Aythya nyroca and Limosa limosa. Bird diversity is higher in human-made ecosystems than in peri-urban and natural ecosystems, while the populations' size is similar in urban and non-urban wetlands. With regard to bird conservation, these inland wetlands, mainly the small ones, are threatened by recurrent droughts and various anthropic stressors, which we describe using our observations of the two last decades (2003-2023). The loss of habitat is significant, reaching 348.5 hectares, while the impacts of reduced precipitation and temperature increase are particularly evident in the mountainous natural lakes.					; Squalli, Wafae/LZH-9208-2025; Mansouri, Ismail/KGL-6975-2024; SAGHROUCHNI, Hamza/AAA-1311-2022; Wink, Michael/E-3803-2012	SAGHROUCHNI, Hamza/0000-0002-4975-2647; Squalli, Wafae/0000-0002-5480-8617; Dakki, Mohamed/0000-0002-8042-3972; Achiban, Hamid/0000-0002-6484-729X; Wink, Michael/0000-0002-7875-4510; El agy, Abdelbari/0000-0002-7042-5114													2076-2615					MAY	2024	14	9							1352	10.3390/ani14091352	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani14091352								38731356					WOS:001219834100001

Morphology-Dependent Water Budgets and Nutrient Fluxes in Arctic Thaw Ponds	PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES												Thaw ponds on the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska are productive ecosystems, providing habitat and food resources for many fish and bird species. Permafrost in this region creates unique pond morphologies: deep troughs, shallow low-centred polygons (LCPs) and larger coalescent ponds. By monitoring seasonal trends in pond volume and chemistry, we evaluated whether pond morphology and size affect water temperature and desiccation, and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fluxes. Evaporation was the largest early-summer water flux in all pond types. LCPs dried quickly and displayed high early-summer nutrient concentrations and losses. Troughs consistently received solute-rich subsurface inflows, which accounted for 12 to 42 per cent of their volume and may explain higher P in the troughs. N to P ratios increased and ammonium concentrations decreased with pond volume, suggesting that P and inorganic N availability may limit ecosystem productivity in older, larger ponds. Arctic summer temperatures will likely increase in the future, which may accelerate mid-summer desiccation. Given their morphology, troughs may remain wet, become warmer and derive greater nutrient loads from their thawing banks. Overall, seasonal- to decadal-scale warming may increase ecosystem productivity in troughs relative to other Arctic Coastal Plain ponds.

Current State of Heterotrophic Bacterioplankton in the Kosinskie Lakes	WATER RESOURCES												From December 2009 to December 2010, the total abundance of bacteria, the abundance of bacteria with electron transport chain, the abundance of viable saprotrophic bacteria, and the concentration of chlorophyll a were studied in water samples from lakes Svyatoe, Beloe, and Chernoe in Kosino-Ukhtomskoe district, Moscow City. The abundance of bacteria with active electron transport chain (CTC+bacteria) and its seasonal variations in Kosinskie Lakes are studied for the first time. Those lakes were found to contain well-developed and actively functioning heterotrophic bacterioplankton, the abundance of which have increased considerably since the 1930s-1940s. The seasonal dynamics of bacterioplankton has also changed. The largest absolute abundance of CTC+bacteria in lakes Svyatoe and Beloe was recorded in summer and autumn (from August to November). The abundance peak of CTH+bacteria in Lake Svyatoe was recorded in September and that in Lake Beloe, in October. The abundance of CTC+bacteria also showed a peak in April. In Lake Chernoe, the abundance of CTC+bacteria was much less than in lakes Svyatoe and Beloe; its maximums were recorded in December 2009 and April 2010. The share of CTC+bacteria in the total abundance of bacteria was 2.4-19.2% in Lake Svyatoe, 1.8-63.0% in Lake Beloe, and 0.96-22.5% in Lake Chernoe. Significant correlations were found to exist in all three lakes between the abundance of active bacterioplankton fraction and chlorophyll a content of water.

JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES												Foraging in stopover areas influences nutritional condition of birds during spring migration. Our purpose was to determine if body mass, percent carcass water, and serum biochemistry would predict energy reserves (carcass fat and protein) in northern pintails (Anas acuta) at a spring staging area, Lake St. Pierre in Quebec, Canada (46degrees11'N, 73degrees08'W). Northern pintails were collected during spring 1997 (14 April-9 May). In this staging area, body mass and percent body water successfully estimated carcass protein and fat in male northern pintails, but only carcass protein in females. None of the seven blood parameters we used accurately estimated nutritional reserves in staging northern pintails. These findings suggest that investigators must use direct estimates of carcass reserves to examine nutrient reserve requirements for egg production, migration, or body maintenance during spring migration.

J	Riise, G; Haaland, SL; Xiao, YH				Riise, Gunnhild; Haaland, Stale Leif; Xiao, Yihua			Coupling of iron and dissolved organic matter in lakes-selective retention of different size fractions	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Increasing concentration of iron (Fe) is observed in many boreal lakes, such as for the present study in Oslo ostmark, SE-Norway (1983-2018). As Fe-regulating processes are complex and dynamic, the link between mobilizing and retention processes is still not well understood. A seasonal study (2017-2018) from two headwaters, with medium and high dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentrations, showed that the loading of Fe to the lakes was highly dependent on flow conditions. Significantly higher values of Fe were related to autumn and winter periods with high runoff of highly colored and aromatic DOM compared to a severe drought period with minimum Fe values in the lakes. Compared to DOM, a significantly larger part of Fe was in a colloidal form, and a size-selective process (dependent on flow and water retention time) seemed to preferentially settle Fe compared to DOM. In contrast to Fe, the variability in DOM concentrations was moderate through the whole year. However, there were significant changes in the spectroscopic properties of DOM, with decreased fluorescence intensity and increased spectral slope during the warm dry season, indicating increased importance of DOM turnover in the lake. As Fe was transported from the catchment during high flow condition, at the same time as the oxic form of sulfur (SO42-), there was no sign of retention of Fe as FeS. We conclude that the mobilization and retention of compounds that are mainly in a colloidal form, such as Fe, are especially vulnerable to changes in flow conditions, suggesting increased variation in Fe levels in a future climate with increased frequency of flooding and drought episodes.																			1015-1621	1420-9055				APR	2023	85	2							57	10.1007/s00027-023-00956-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-023-00956-w													WOS:000957381200001

The potential influence of sea-surface temperature (SST) on ISM variation at millennial time scales has been progressively proposed in recent studies. Towards a better understanding of Holocene evolution of ISM, especially the potential response to variations in SST, a 643 cm continuous sediment sequence covering the past 11.1 ka was recovered from Beihai Wetland in western Yunnan Plateau. Fossil pollen analysis revealed that evergreen broadleaved forest dominated the regional vegetation in the early Holocene, which represented a warm and humid period associated with strong ISM. Expansions of deciduous broadleaved forest and grassland from 5.2 cal. ka BP to the present, together with the appearance of abundant plant remains, indicate the formation of the wetland system. Ordination analysis of the pollen assemblages further confirmed the abrupt vegetation turnover at ca. 5.2 cal. ka BP, which is consistent with the abrupt decline in reconstructed mean annual precipitation (P-ann, from ca. 1400 to 1100 mm), and indicates an abrupt decline in the summer monsoon. We performed a climate regime shift test on various records from the ISM domain and eastern Africa and found this phenomenon as well, which could not be explained by changes in solar insolation or the migration of the ITCZ. A mid-Holocene cooling was detected from the Indian Ocean, especially a decreased SST in the tropical Indian Ocean ca. 5.5 cal. ka BP. Cooling of the tropical Indian Ocean possibly caused the abrupt retreat of the summer monsoon by restraining the duration of the monsoonal season and the convergent process, which was supported by an abrupt monsoon decline based on results from a minimal concept model.					; Cao, Xianyong/L-7168-2019	Wang, Yongbo/0000-0002-5350-1867; Herzschuh, Ulrike/0000-0003-0999-1261													0930-7575	1432-0894				OCT	2020	55	7-8					1961	1977		10.1007/s00382-020-05363-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-020-05363-7		JUL 2020											WOS:000548495300004

Since 1973, Lake Ontario has been stocked predominately with Clearwater, Jenny, Killala, Manitou, Seneca, and Superior strains. Reproductive success of these strains was assessed by using allozyme and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) characters with mixed-stock analysis. Parental origins of wild fry were compared over several years at Stony Island reef and between Stony Island reef and Yorkshire Island reef in 1990. Strain origins at Stony Island reef were examined among four year-classes (1986, 1988, 1989, and 1990) of wild fry and among three year-classes (1988, 1989, 1990) of fry reared from eggs collected in late autumn. Allelic frequencies were not different among year-classes within the wild fry and egg collections from Stony Island reef (P 0.05). Frequencies of mtDNA haplotypes also were not different among the 1988, 1989, and 1990 fry samples (mtDNA data were unavailable for the 1986 sample). Allozyme comparisons between fry and egg samples over the three year-classes indicated that embryos collected in autumn were genetically similar to fry the next spring. Based on mixed-stock analysis, 67-90% of parental contributions were from the Seneca strain; the remaining contribution was attributed to Killala and Superior strains. At the Yorkshire Island site, only eggs were sampled and analyzed (no fry). In contrast to Stony Island, strain contributions to this sample were 35% Killala, 28% Manitou, and 23% Superior. Hatchery strains identified at the Yorkshire Island site fertilized and deposited eggs but do not appear to produce fry (only two fry were collected over a 3-year period). Thus, the suitability of strains other than Seneca in producing wild fry remains in question.

The mysid, particulate organic matter (POM, mostly phytoplankton), and zooplankton showed a clear seasonal change in .delta. 15N with high values in spring and fall, but the surface bottom mud did not. A year to year variation as well as seasonal change in .delta.15 N was found in the mysid. The annual averages of .delta.15N of each material collected in 1984/85 are as follows: surface bottom mud, 6.3% (range: .permill. 5.7-6.9%); POM, 7.9% (5.8-11.8%); large sized mysid, 11.6% (7.7-14.3%); zooplankton, 12.5% (10.0-16.4%); prawn, 13.2% (9.9-15.4%); goby, 15.1% (13.8-16.7%). The degree of 15N enrichment by the mysid was determined as 3.2% by the laboratory rearing experiments. The apparent parallel relationship between the POM and the mysid in the temporal patterns of .delta.15N with about 3% difference suggests the POM (mostly phytoplankton) as a possible food source of N. intermedia in this lake through the year.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				APR 9	1990	194	1					85	90		10.1007/BF00012114	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00012114													WOS:A1990DB76100008

This area is important as summer range for caribou and a variety of birds, and there is evidence for a human presence as early as 3000 B.P. Field studies between 1984 and 1988 and the operation of climatic autostations from 1987 to 1995 revealed a warm summer climate and cold winters. There is a locally rich and diverse vegetation, including Betula glandulosa and other species that are indicative of the low arctic bioclimatic zone and mark the present northern limit of that zone in the eastern Canadian Arctic. Air photos and Landsat imagery were used to map vegetation beyond the field areas, leading to an estimate of 46% of the land area in continuous vegetation (tundra) of some type and 15% with shrub and heath elements. Palynology of sediment cores taken from Nettilling Lake permitted extrapolation from present bioclimatic conditions to 4750 years B.P. Betula and therefore elements of a low arctic vegetation association appear to have been present in the area during most of that period, indicating a local bioclimatic system that has been relatively stable under regional variations of climate.																			0004-0843					JUN	1997	50	2					167	177																WOS:A1997XE93600007
J	KOHLER, J				KOHLER, J			GROWTH, PRODUCTION AND LOSSES OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN THE LOWLAND RIVER SPREE .1. POPULATION-DYNAMICS	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The seasonal and longitudinal dynamics of dominant phytoplankton populations were observed in the lower Spree (Germany), a lowland river draining several lakes. Centric diatoms and cyanobacteria were the chief components of the total phytoplankton biomass of 16 mg l-1 at the end of the river course (average March-October, 1988-89). The cyanobacteria required a retention time of several weeks in a drained lake to establish stable populations, whereas the other algal populations originated from upstream impoundments and slow-flowing river stretches. In spring, the dominant populations increased (the diatoms Nitzschia acicularis, Asterionella formosa, Stephanodiscus hantzschii, Cyclostephanos dubius, Cyclotella radiosa, C.meneghiniana) or kept their abundances nearly constant (cyanobacterium Limnothrix redekei, diatom Synedra acus), but the biomass of the 'summer species' (diatom Actinocyclus normanii, cyanobacteria Planktothrix agardhii and Aphanizomenon sp.) was halved along the river course. These seasonal differences in algal growth are probably caused by the changed mixing pattern in the regions of origin and thus different pre-adaptation to turbulent,mixing. Pronounced clear-water phases occurred regularly at the end of May. They were intensified along the river course despite the lack of mesozooplankton. The dynamics of phytoplankton were reflected in the proportions of dissolved and particulate nutrients. The nutrient supply was always high enough to make limitations of algal growth improbable.					; Köhler, Jan/C-2633-2014	Kohler, Jan/0000-0003-1894-2912; 													0142-7873					MAR	1993	15	3					335	349		10.1093/plankt/15.3.335	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/15.3.335													WOS:A1993KP15500005

Phylogenetic and functional prokaryotic diversity in the Hoito-Gol mesothermal mineral spring (Eastern Sayan Mountains, Buryat Republic)	MICROBIOLOGY												High-throughput sequencing was used for comparative analysis of microbial communities of the water and mat from the Hoito-Gol mesothermal mineral sulfide spring (Eastern Sayan Mountains, Buryat Republic). Activity of microbial communities was determined. While both spring biotopes were dominated by members of three bacterial phyla-Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes-they differed drastically in the composition of predominant phylotypes (at the genus level). In the water, the organisms widespread in aquatic environments were predominant, mostly aerobic chemoorganotrophs of the genera Acinetobacter, Pedobacter, and Flavobacterium. In the microbial mat, the organisms actively involved in the sulfur cycle predominated, including sulfur-reducing bacteria Sulfurospirillum, sulfate-reducing deltaproteobacteria, sulfuroxidizing chemoautotrophic bacteria, anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria of the phyla Chloroflexi and Chlorobi, as well as purple bacteria belonging to the alpha-, -, and gamma-Proteobacteria. Microbial mats of the spring exhibited higher phylogenetic diversity compared to high-temperature mats containing photosynthetic microorganisms.

Between similar to 1800 to 1600 cal yr BP, the coarser silty sand with few Poaceae and Asteraceae pollen with other proxy data, indicate that the region experienced a strong Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). Subsequently, from similar to 1600 to 1350 cal yr BP, presence of mixed moist deciduous taxa such as Shorea robusta, Madhuca indica, Rubiaceae, Morus alba, Syzygium, and Moraceae indicate a moderate ISM while between 1350 to 1200 cal yr BP, the dominance of dry deciduous taxa viz. Acacia sp., Bombax ceiba, Holoptelea, Rutaceae, Madhuca indica, Mangifera indica etc. suggested weak ISM conditions. A pulsative ameliorating trend from similar to 1200 to 1030 cal yr BP showed the dominance of deciduous taxa such as Holoptelea, Rutaceae, Ziziphus, Rubiaceae, Maytenus and Acanthaceae etc. indicating warm and moist climatic conditions, followed by a weak ISM until similar to 900 cal yr BP and improved ISM until 620 cal yr BP. Subsequently, an improving trend in the ISM from similar to 620 to 450 cal yr BP was observed, with increased dominance of wetland taxa, followed by acute dry climate beyond similar to 450 cal yr BP indicating poor ISM conditions. Additionally, the alternating warm and cold episodes had a direct impact on vegetation, forcing human civilizations to migrate from their original locations and contributing to the downfall of prominent dynasties. Furthermore, this study lays the foundation for future research into issues related to vegetation change, the amount of ISM shift, and human culture-climate relationship.

Gammarus lacustris is uncommon and generally restricted to mountain ponds and lakes between 2500 and 3400 m where water temperatures do not exceed 20.degree. C. Hyalella was found at 148 stations and Gammarus at 29 stations. Both species are characteristic of littoral areas containing rooted macrophytes and coarse bottom debris; such waters are anaerobic or frozen to the bottom in winter. No significant habitat differences were found with respect to pH, water color, total dissolved solids and minimal dissolved O2 concentrations. Hyalella occurred over a greater range of water hardness, but in laboratory aquaria both species had similar survivorship curves in hard waters. The thermal death point for Gammarus was 26-28.degree. C; for Hyalella it was 35-37.degree. C.

Increasing Cl concentrations have been observed in the last few decades in several rivers and lakes, mainly in northern countries. In Italy, present levels and temporal changes of sodium (Na) and Cl in water bodies have rarely been assessed. Based on long-term data for the lakes of the subalpine district in Italy (Maggiore, Lugano, Como, Iseo, Garda), we analyzed trends affecting Cl and Na concentrations during the last 25 years, with the aim of identifying temporal changes and assessing possible causes. An in-depth analysis is presented for Lake Maggiore. Positive temporal Na and Cl trends were evident in all studied lakes, with the trends increasing since early 2000s. Data for Lake Maggiore tributaries showed a clear seasonality (higher values in winter and early spring). The NaCl used as road de-icing agent, together with Cl discharge from wastewater treatment plants, were identified as the main causes for the observed trends. Chloride concentrations in the lakes are below the threshold limit for reduced water quality and below concentrations known to harm aquatic biota. However, considering the relevance of deep subalpine lakes, representing almost 80 % of the total freshwater volume in Italy, these trends indicate an important chemical change, which warrants further analysis.					; Kamburska, Lyudmila/ABG-2391-2020; cerasino, leonardo/G-8466-2011; ROGORA, MICHELA/IZD-8951-2023; Cerasino, Leonardo/G-8466-2011; Lepori, Fabio/F-8966-2012; Salmaso, Nico/O-8968-2015; Mosello, Rosario/ABA-4690-2021; ROGORA, MICHELA/B-9237-2008	LEONI, BARBARA/0000-0001-9448-9457; cerasino, leonardo/0000-0002-0839-9832; Mosello, Rosario/0000-0002-1873-0162; Salmaso, Nico/0000-0001-6057-3642; Kamburska, Lyudmila/0000-0001-5071-6953; Lepori, Fabio/0000-0002-6438-9452; ROGORA, MICHELA/0000-0003-3515-0220													0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2015	22	23					19013	19026		10.1007/s11356-015-5090-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-5090-6								26233742					WOS:000365816000067

Among 83 water ecosystems examined, 58 were found in blooming condition almost every year during last 2 decades. All natural lakes, accumulations, rivers and chanals in Vojvodina province (agricultural part) proved to be sites with frequent cyanobacterial proliferation. During the summer 2005-spring 2006 microcystin-LR survey in Vojvodina, the toxin was permanently present in all examined ecosystems and the highest value of 362.68 mu gL(-1) was detected in Ludos Lake. The part of Central Serbia is very problematic for ground water supply. For that reason more than 20 reservoirs serve as drinking water suppliers. Significant and persistant cyanobacterial blooms have been recognized in 9 of them. Samples for cyanotoxin analyses were taken during and after blooms in Celije Reservoir and in drinking water in Krusevac town 2 days later.

J	Tokano, T				Tokano, Tetsuya			Orbitally and geographically caused seasonal asymmetry in Titan's tropospheric climate and its implication for the lake distribution	ICARUS												Previously, seasonal asymmetry in Titan's climate caused by Saturn's orbital eccentricity was proposed as a possible external cause of the asymmetric polar lake distribution on Titan. However, climate studies of other planets indicate that seasonal asymmetry can also be caused by a hemispheric asymmetry in geography such as the ocean-continent distribution or topography. A global climate model is used to investigate whether orbital forcing or hemispheric asymmetry in geography is more important for the seasonal asymmetry in Titan's climate and the distribution of polar methane deposits. Titan's large-scale topography generally decreases from equator to pole and thereby induces meridional circulation with upwelling at low latitudes and downwelling at high latitudes due to near-surface horizontal temperature gradients. This circulation is stronger in the southern hemisphere, which contains steep slopes at mid latitudes, and acts to transport dry air downward near the south pole and to reduce the precipitation in southern summer. Consequently, the annual precipitation minus evaporation is substantially smaller in the south polar region than in the north polar region. Orbital parameter variations quantitatively affect the polar precipitation, yet are unable to reverse the vast hemispheric asymmetry in the polar precipitation. The accumulation of Titan's lakes near the north pole could therefore be a semipermanent feature related to Titan's topography and may resist the Croll-Milankovitch cycle.																			0019-1035	1090-2643				JAN 1	2019	317						337	353		10.1016/j.icarus.2018.07.025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2018.07.025													WOS:000455071300025

SOURCES OF MORTALITY IN THE ENDANGERED EASTERN MASSASAUGA (SISTRURUS CATENATUS) IN ILLINOIS	HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY												The identification and management of threats to endangered species are imperative for conservation. Reptile populations are declining globally, yet their secretive nature and a lack of demographic data often make the implementation of conservation strategies difficult. The Eastern Massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus) has been recommended for listing as threatened under the federal endangered species act and listed in Illinois as endangered since 1994. As part of a long-term population monitoring project, we quantified sources of mortality in a population of the Eastern Massasauga using data collected from 2000-2011. Using mortality data amassed during both observational and radio-telemetry studies (2001-2003 and 2009-2011), we classified each mortality event into one of eleven categories. We used Poisson regression to evaluate the impacts of sex, stage-class, season, and study type on mortality. Our results indicate automobiles and predation are the leading sources of mortality, together accounting for over 50% of observed mortalities. We found season and mortality category significantly affected the number of observed mortalities. Most mortalities occur in the summer and fall when snakes are most active. Observational studies detected nearly all the automobile mortality while radio-telemetric studies detected nearly all the predation events. We offer conservation and management recommendations to reduce Eastern Massasauga mortality at Carlyle Lake, which are applicable throughout the range.

At the beginning of a longer-term biogeochemical study, the investigated area (six sampling sites) comprised beds of the mussel Mytilus edulis which disappeared under the severe weather conditions. Large amounts of sediment were eroded and redeposited. Evidence for emplaced biodeposits was given by TOC measurements and molecular distribution profiles of n- and iso/anteiso-fatty acids and of sterols. Absolute concentrations of fatty acids and sterols in 1996 were lower than in 1995, despite a higher organic carbon content in 1996(>1.4% compared to 0.8%). This indicates that redeposition was accompanied by a decrease in the labile organic matter fraction by oxidation. After removal of the mussels, the sedimentary organic matter composition was nearly uniform at all sampling sites. This was manifested in ii-fatty acid distribution patterns, relative proportions of algal to terrigenous and bacterial acids, cholestanol/cholesterol ratios and sterol distributions. An enormous diatom bloom of Coscinodiscus concinnus in spring 1996 caused an increase in the amounts of n-C-14 and n-C-16 fatty acids in the surface sediments. These fatty acids then dominated the distribution patterns of almost all samples investigated. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Assessing environmental stressors on a commercial walleye fishery from a large northern ecosystem (Tathlina Lake) using water chemistry and paleolimnology	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Tathlina Lake (Northwest Territories, Canada) is a large, shallow ecosystem in the rapidly warming northern boreal forest. This lake is of considerable cultural and economic significance as it supports a commercially important walleye (Sander vitreus) fishery that has experienced large fluctuations since the 1940s, the causes of which are poorly understood. Here we used paleolimnology to describe long-term environmental changes in the lake that may have contributed to recent collapses in walleye populations. The sub-fossil remains of diatoms and chironomids were used to assess changes in turbidity, nutrients, and oxygen levels, all of which are important to walleye. Minimal changes have occurred in diatom assemblages from the early 1920s to present, suggesting that turbidity and nutrients have not changed markedly in the lake. Hypoxia-tolerant chironomid taxa were found throughout the sediment record, and our modern water chemistry showed that oxygen levels were supersaturated in the summer, but close to the lower tolerance limit of walleye in winter. An increase in sedimentary chlorophyll-a since similar to 1940 suggests Tathlina Lake is affected by recent climate warming. Our findings indicate that walleye populations are likely regularly exposed to hypoxic winter conditions, which may increase the sensitivity of the population to other interacting stressors that occur with recent climate warming. Long-term records of environmental change in large, shallow northern lakes are rare, and paleolimnology provides a framework to reconstruct missing monitoring data, especially in lakes that are economically and culturally important to northern communities.

J	Nishi, Y; Tabeta, S				Nishi, Y; Tabeta, S			Analysis of the contribution of ice algae to the ice-covered ecosystem in Lake Saroma by means of a coupled ice-ocean ecosystem model	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												A new coupled ice-ocean ecosystem model that links the pelagic and ice ecosystems was used to clarify the role of ice algae in ice-covered ocean ecosystems. The model was applied to Lake Saroma (Hokkaido, Japan) in 1992. Comparison of the model's results with observational data confirmed that the model reproduced the behavior of the ecosystem with acceptable accuracy during the period from winter to spring. The primary production of the ice algae is effectively transported into the pelagic system by means of physical releasing effects: brine convection, ice melting and freezing, and diffusion generated at the bottom of the ice. Ice algae released from the ice are rapidly exported because of their high sinking speed and the shallow depth of Lake Saroma. For this reason, the zooplankton in Lake Saroma cannot graze these released algae. However, zooplankton actively graze the ice algae living along the bottom of the ice. These results show that, before their release, ice algae play an important role as a food source for overwintering zooplankton. A sensitivity analysis revealed a positive correlation between the sinking speed of the released ice algae and the magnitude of the spring bloom by pelagic phytoplankton, and that the time when secondary production becomes active is an important factor in the linkage between these two algal populations.

In each wetland, phytoplankton biomass was significantly higher in the turbid lake than in the clear water lake. Although total macrozooplankton biomass and the contribution of daphnids to total zooplankton biomass was comparable in the clear water and the turbid lakes, the grazing pressure of macrozooplankton on phytoplankton as estimated from zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratios was higher in the clear water lakes. Estimated grazing by daphnids in the clear water lakes was always high in spring. In summer, however, daphnid biomass was low or daphnids were even absent during prolonged periods. During those periods phytoplankton was probably controlled by smaller macrozooplankton or by submerged macrophytes through nutrient competition, allelopathic effects or increased sedimentation rates in the macrophyte vegetation.

Here, we investigated the environmental and spatial drivers regulating species composition of the submerged macrophyte community in Erhai Lake, China, over different seasons and water-depth gradients. Results showed that environmental and spatial drivers significantly affected species composition of the sub-merged macrophyte community at the local and fine scale, with shared environmental and spatial drivers ex-plaining 28.3%-38.4% of the variation in species composition for all four seasons. The unique spatial drivers demonstrated a relatively stable contribution (11.8%-16.0%) over the four seasons, but the contributions from the unique environmental drivers showed seasonal variability, being high in summer and winter. In shallow water (0-3 m), spatial drivers were more important in the process of community assembly; in deep water (3-6 m), however, environmental and spatial drivers both significantly affected community assembly. The different water areas also showed strong seasonal changes in the explanatory power of environmental and spatial drivers of submerged macrophyte community variation. Thus, future studies should consider sampling macro-phytes over different seasons and at different water depths to better trace the indicators regulating submerged macrophyte community assembly in lakes.					; Fu, Hui/L-4752-2016; Wang, Hao/JBJ-1954-2023	hui, Fu/0000-0001-7720-0463; Wen, Zihao/0000-0003-3885-5568; CAO, YU/0000-0003-2716-6580; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2020	117								106696	10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106696	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106696													WOS:000555555100010

For microbiological examinations, bigheaded carp gut contents and water column samples from Lake Balaton (Hungary) were collected from spring to autumn in 2013. Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene were performed to reveal the composition. According to the DGGE patterns, bacterial communities of water samples separated clearly from that of the intestines. Moreover, the bacterial communities in the foreguts and hindguts were also strikingly dissimilar. Based on pyrosequencing, both foregut and hindgut samples were predominated by the fermentative genus Cetobacterium (Fusobacteria). The presence of some phytoplankton taxa and the high relative abundance of cellulose-degrading bacteria in the guts suggest that intestinal microbes may have an important role in digesting algae and making them utilizable for bigheaded carps that lack cellulase enzyme. In turn, the complete absence of typical heterotrophic freshwater bacteria in all studied sections of the intestines indicated that bacterioplankton probably has a negligible role in the nutrition of bigheaded carps.

Comparison of an urban lake targeted for rehabilitation and a reference lake based on robotic monitoring	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												A reference lake, Otisco Lake, NY, was selected to evaluate rehabilitation initiatives to mitigate severe cultural eutrophication of Onondaga Lake, NY. Onondaga Lake was mesotrophic before European development. The reference lake selection was based on an analysis of paired monitoring datasets for temperature, fluorometric chlorophyll (Chl(f/a).) and dissolved oxygen (DO), collected daily by robotic profiling platforms for the spring to fall interval of three years. The various metrics of trophic state documented here for Otisco Lake represent reasonable informal interim goals for the rehabilitation of the cultural eutrophication of Onondaga Lake. The use of Otisco Lake as a reference site is supported by its similar stratification/mixing regime and mesotrophic state, in addition to its proximity (similar to 25 km) and similar morphometry with Onondaga Lake. Strong contrasts in water quality manifestations of trophic state are depicted in Onondaga Lake, including higher Chl(f/a). (3.5-fold), prevalence of blooms, greater deviations of DO from saturation conditions, much lower minimum DO values at fall turnover in the upper layers and a higher volumetric hypolinmetic oxygen deficit (VHOD; 1.55-fold). Advantages of the fine vertical and temporal scale capabilities of the monitoring platforms are demonstrated in characterizing these and other limnological features. Continued robotic monitoring at Otisco Lake as a reference site and Onondaga Lake through the rehabilitation program will support ongoing comparisons to assess progress and will help engage stakeholders in the process.

The high salinity is mainly derived from saline groundwater that emerges through offshore and onshore springs along the coast of the lake. Smaller amounts of solutes are attributed to dispersed seepage and molecular diffusion from the bottom of the lake. This chapter reviews the salinity of Lake Kinneret from the following aspects: the history of salinity measurements, the karst hydrological system of the saline springs that recharge the lake, analysis of the lake solute balance, the chemical composition of the lake as a result of the saline spring's contribution, hydrological conceptual model of the salinization mechanism, and finally, a complete mixing type model to predict the future salinity of the lake is presented.																			1573-4595	2543-005X	978-94-017-8944-8; 978-94-017-8943-1				2014	6						113	+		10.1007/978-94-017-8944-8_8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-8944-8_8	10.1007/978-94-017-8944-8												WOS:000459771400009

Dry deposition of SRP represented 79% of total SRP inputs and it showed a seasonal pattern similar to Saharan dust export to this region, with maxima during spring and summer. Bacterial abundance was significantly correlated with SRP atmospheric deposition, suggesting the influence of this input on bacterioplankton dynamics. The field evidence was experimentally corroborated using bacterial regrowth cultures performed with dust-amended lake water. Dust addition significantly increased SRP concentration in lake water and it stimulated bacterial abundance. Regarding phytoplankton community, only one species, the chrysophyte Chromulina nevadensis, was significantly related to SRP inputs and, consequently, there was a significant decrease in phytoplankton species diversity after atmospheric SRP inputs. Since changes in climate will presumably lead to an alteration in dust export, these results point to the need of further studies on the potential effects of this alteration on bacterioplankton and phytoplankton dynamics in remote oligotrophic systems.					; Reche, Isabel/K-7120-2014	Morales Baquero, Rafael/0000-0002-7075-7899; Reche, Isabel/0000-0003-2908-1724; Pulido, Elvira/0000-0002-5436-2133													1015-1621	1420-9055				APR	2008	70	1					1	9		10.1007/s00027-007-0944-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-007-0944-8													WOS:000254755900001

The abundance of predators was estimated from total counts of infected prey cells and by counting plaque-forming units. In spite of the large difference between both determinations, their variations with depth and time followed very similar patterns. During the summer, in the hypolimnion, and during the winter in the entire lake, up to 60% of the prey cells had potential predators attached. In comparison, plaque counts showed that viable predators represented less than 1% of the population of the prey. Our results demonstrated that predatory bacteria were far more abundant than indicated by the low viable counts obtained, suggesting that they play a more important role in controlling phototrophic bacterial populations than is currently assumed.

However, the distribution of anammox bacteria in freshwater lake and the associated environmental factors remain essentially unclear. The present study investigated the temporal and spatial dynamics of sediment anammox bacterial populations in eutrotrophic Dianchi Lake and mesotrophic Erhai Lake on the Yunnan Plateau (southwestern China). The remarkable spatial change of anammox bacterial abundance was found in Dianchi Lake, while the relatively slight spatial shift occurred in Erhai Lake. Dianchi Lake had greater anammox bacterial abundance than Erhai Lake. In both Dianchi Lake and Erhai Lake, anammox bacteria were much more abundant in summer than in spring. Anammox bacterial community richness, diversity, and structure in these two freshwater lakes were subjected to temporal and spatial variations. Sediment anammox bacterial communities in Dianchi Lake and Erhai Lake were dominated by Candidatus Brocadia and a novel phylotype followed by Candidatus Kuenenia; however, these two lakes had distinct anammox bacterial community structure. In addition, trophic status determined sediment anammox bacterial community structure.

The study was commenced to determine the status of fauna of national park, diversity indices and environmental intimidations to their protection. The data was collected by point count method. The fauna observed there included 17 species of mammals including Asiatic wolf that is endangered. Five species of amphibians and 27 species of reptiles were found there. Among reptiles, Chitra indica is endangered. The results of study showed that maximum account of 7443 birds of 74 species belong to 35 families and representative of 16 orders were witnessed during the study. The seasonal distribution pattern of birds shown that year around resident were 76%, 7% were summer breeders, 4% were passage migrants while 5% were uncommon and 8% were common winter migrants. Hunting, deforestation, wood logging, disturbance by human activities and habitat loss are the major threats for wild animals at LSNP. Alteration in natural lake and their flows for recreational purposes is also a major threat.

J	Wu, Y; Salamova, A; Venier, M				Wu, Yan; Salamova, Amina; Venier, Marta			Using diagnostic ratios to characterize sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the Great Lakes atmosphere	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The present study characterized source profiles of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) for the Great Lakes atmosphere using nine PAH diagnostic ratios (DRs). The samples were collected from six sites in the Great Lakes basin during 1996-2018 within the Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network (IADN). In general, pyrogenic sources, including coal combustion and vehicular emissions, were the most important contributors to atmospheric profiles, in particular at the urban sites. Diesel emissions accounted for a larger portion of the traffic-originated PAHs than gasoline emissions at all sites, but this compositional pattern was less obvious at the urban sites. Temporal analyses for DRs revealed that the relative contribution of petrogenic sources and volatilization from surfaces has been increasing gradually, and that the gaps in PAH emissions between diesel- and gasoline-engines appeared to be further amplified in recent years. Coal combustion and non-pyrogenic emissions were the main PAH sources for winter and summer air, respectively, but none of the DRs responded to these changes. DRs were generally different between vapor and particle phases. Our findings shed light on spatial and temporal trends of PAH DRs and PAH source characterization in the Great Lakes basin. Additionally, this study confirmed the usefulness of DRs, especially when combined with the PMF analysis, while also highlighting the limitation of multiple DRs. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Phosphorus often limits bacterial production in freshwater ecosystems. However, little is known on whether different bacteria contribute to inorganic and organic phosphorus uptake proportionally to their relative abundance and production. Here, we followed the temporal dynamics of the main heterotrophic bacterial taxa taking up inorganic phosphate (P-33-Pi) and organic phosphorus (P-33-ATP) in two mountain lakes and compared them to their contribution to bacterial production (H-3-leucine uptake). The short turnover times for Pi and ATP suggested that in both lakes, phosphorus was limiting most of the year. The bulk uptake rates and the fractions of cells labelled positive for Pi and ATP uptake followed a seasonal trend with minima in winter and maxima in summer. Generally, the bacterial taxa examined contributed to Pi and ATP uptake proportionally to their relative abundance, but not always to their contribution to bacterial production. For instance, AcI Actinobacteria were often underrepresented in phosphorus uptake compared with leucine incorporation suggesting they might have high intracellular C:P ratios. Our results emphasize that ATP utilization is widespread among freshwater bacteria and indicate that members within the dominant bacterial taxa (Actinobacteria and Betaproteobacteria) have variable phosphorus requirements, probably due to their different growth potential and variable degrees of homeostasis.					; Sommaruga, Ruben/E-5335-2011	Perez, Maria Teresa/0000-0001-8528-4353; Sommaruga, Ruben/0000-0002-1055-2461													1462-2912	1462-2920				DEC	2016	18	12					4782	4793		10.1111/1462-2920.13368	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.13368								27130525					WOS:000392946900037

Previous knowledge of these species has been limited to the description of their morphology and habitat. We provide new information about the ecology of Mesaiokeras hurei Krsinic, 2003, one of the small-size species of the family and found only in an isolated marine lake on the southern Adriatic island of Mljet (Croatia). Genetic markers were used to investigate its phylogenetic relationships with other copepods. The abundance of M. hurei abundance was highly variable over the years and seasons sampled. Densities were higher in spring and autumn. It was particularly abundant in 2011, averaging 629 +/- 800 individuals/m(3), and with a maximum of 1971 individuals m(-3) in November, but averaged 74 +/- 71 individuals/m(3) and 66 +/- 71 individuals/m(3) in 2001 and 2008, respectively. Specimens were found in a range of temperatures, from 10.5 degrees C to 18.3 degrees C, but a majority of individuals (67%) was found in the 12-14 degrees C layer. In addition to temperature, oxygen was a significant predictor (p < 0.001) of the vertical micro-distribution of M. hurei.

Since 2004, they have roosted in the paddy fields during the night and foraged in the paddy and surrounding fields during the day, coinciding with the time when farmers began using winter-flooded paddy fields. Before 2004, the swans visited the area for foraging during the day and roosted at nearby lakes, wetlands, and sandbars along rivers during the night. When the swans visited our target paddy fields, the water gradually became green and began to emit an ammonia-like odor. In this study, we investigated the changes in the water qualities of winter-flooded paddy fields and the influence of bird excrement on water quality in the paddy fields during winter, and then estimated the amounts of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) provided by bird droppings to the paddy fields. The mean concentrations of N, P, suspended sediment, and total organic carbon were higher in the overwintering season than during the irrigation season. This trend was observed in both the first and second seasons of the study. The spatial distribution of electric conductivity (EC) measured using a GEM-2 broad-band electromagnetic sensor coincided with that of the matted sites of Tundra Swans in the paddy field, which indicated that the excrement of the swans affected the EC distribution. The total input amounts of N and P from the birds' excrement to the flooded paddy fields were estimated using a simple model that considered bird counts and probable nutrient content of feces, and the amounts were found to be equivalent to approximately 30% of those present in the standard fertilizers used for rice during the irrigation period. These results suggested that the excrement from the swans markedly influences the water qualities of winter-flooded paddy fields. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Neoichnology of an Arctic fluvial point bar, North Slope, Alaska (USA)	GEOLOGICAL QUARTERLY					2nd International Congress on Ichnology	AUG 29-SEP 08, 2008	Cracow, POLAND					This study is the first to describe the neoichnology of an Arctic fluvial point bar (Colville River, Alaska, USA) and examine the sedimentological effects of tracemakers in this sedimentary setting. Seasonal extremes in discharge and sediment deposition in this system result in sandwaves, current ripples, gravel bars and mud veneers, with the latter forming extensive mudcracks. Organismal traces are abundantly represented in sandy mudflats on the downstream portion of the point bar and are characterized by: (1) abundant shallow horizontal invertebrate burrows and surface trails, directly comparable to Treptichnus, Cochlichnus and Aulichnites; (2) avian tracks and (3) large mammal tracks. Treptichnus-like burrows are attributed to dipteran larvae tracemakers, whereas Cochlichnus- and Helminthoidichnites-like trails were likely from nematodes or oligochaetes. Avian tracks are primarily from seagulls, geese, swans and plovers; mudcracks were connected directly to tracks, which developed as a result of increased amounts of sunlight available during the polar summer. Mammal tracks were dominated by those of caribou (Rangifer tarandus), but include grizzly bear (Ursos arctos) and other mammals. Caribou herds significantly impacted emergent and submergent mudflat surfaces through advection of saturated thixotropic muds and dry sand, while also fracturing mudcracked zones, and hence actively produced mud clasts. Vertebrates thus can cause considerable mixing, redistribution and erosion of sediments in Arctic point bars with only a few months of activity. Ichnodiversity was low but accompanied by high trace abundance, reflecting favorable hydrodynamic, solar and atmospheric conditions throughout a polar summer. In contrast, sedimentation and bioturbation are absent during winter months, when ice cover prevents organismal interactions with fluvial sediments. As a result, the ichnocoenose does not fit easily into paradigms of previously defined continental ichnofacies (e.g., Mermia and Scoyenia) and is more like a composite ichnofacies. These findings can thus serve as a starting point for more detailed studies of circumpolar point bars, while also adding new perspectives to the interpretation of trace fossils in circumpolar fluvial environments.																			1641-7291	2082-5099					2009	53	4			SI		383	396																WOS:000274039800003

Marsh fish exhibited small size and reduced length at age. However, growth rates of older marsh fish equaled or exceeded those of freshwater largemouth bass. Relative weights of marsh fish indicated excellent conditions during all seasons, whereas freshwater fish exhibited reduced condition in early spring and fall. Laboratory trails consisting of 120-d exposure of marsh and freshwater largemouth bass to four salinity levels (0, 4, 8, and 12.permill.) indicated a significant decrease in growth rate of freshwater largemouth bass with increasing salinity level up to 8.permill.. No such decrease was observed for marsh largemouth bass. All fish held at 12.permill. stopped feeding within 1 week after the experiment began and died before the experimental ended. Sheared principal components analysis indicated differences in body shape between marsh and freshwater largemouth bass. We make the case that a complex interaction of several factors, including salinity, prey availability, habitat complexity, and predation risk, influences growth patterns among marsh largemouth bass. Characteristic body morphology and length at age of marsh fish suggest that largemouth bass adapt to biotic conditions in low-salinity marshes through an alternative growth strategy.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAY	1990	119	3					545	552		10.1577/1548-8659(1990)119<0545:GOLBIL>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1990)119<0545:GOLBIL>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1990EH46000017

The process and mechanism by which phosphorus (P) release from sediments induced by A. philoxeroides decomposition occurring in late autumn or early spring were investigated experimentally. The results showed that as simulating time increased, redox potential and dissolved oxygen at water sediment interface decreased rapidly, reaching reducing (90 mV) and anoxic (0.754 mg/L) conditions, respectively. As a result, soluble reactive P. dissolved total P and total P concentrations in overlying water all rapidly increased with time from 0.02, 0.06 and 0.08 mg/L to 0.53, 0.75 and 0.98 mg/L on average, respectively. In sediments, the rank order of different P speciation contents changed from Oc-P>Fe-P approximate to Org-P>Ca-P>Al-P approximate to Ex-P to Org-P approximate to Fe-P>Oc-P>Ca-P>Al-P approximate to Ex-P after the experiment, and Fe-P contributed the most to P release from sediments. These results indicate that Fe-P release from sediments during A. philoxeroides decomposition may be an important factor resulting in algae blooms in the lakes of eastern China.

The Effect of Climatic Shifts on Biodiversity of Phytocenosis: Lake Arakhley (Eastern Siberia, Russia)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT												Lake Arakhley is located within the Lake Baikal basin in Eastern Siberia, Russia. The area is characterized by continental subarctic climate with considerate diurnal temperature range, long cold dry winters and short hot summers with more precipitation occurring during the latter half of the summer. Climatic shifts in high water years and low water years result in morphometric changes in the lake and in the chemical and physical parameters of the ecosystem. During low water years, concentrations of ammonium nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen are decreased, whereas nitrate concentration increases. High water years feature average concentrations of ammonium ions 1.5-2 times higher than the values of recent dry years. Redundancy analysis (RDA) of abiotic factors and biotic community indicated that the community structure shows the greatest correlation with physical and chemical parameters of water and biogenic elements (nitrites, ammonium, phosphates) along the first axis, and with the lake depth and transparency along the second axis. Changes in abiotic factors induce functioning and formation of characteristic communities of the primary producers in the trophic structure of the ecosystem. During low water years, with increased level of autochthonous organic matter, Lindavia comta dominance is observed, while during high water years, with increased allochthonous organic matter Asterionella fonnosa appeared as dominant. Currently, during low water years, the hydrophytes community is monodominant and composed of Ceratophyllum demersum. Meanwhile, such species indicating eutrophic conditions as Myriophyllum sibiricum, Potamogeton pectinatus are found in the lake vegetation.

J	Wang, S; Nath, D; Chen, W; Ma, TJ				Wang, Sai; Nath, Debashis; Chen, Wen; Ma, Tianjiao			CMIP5 model simulations of warm Arctic-cold Eurasia pattern in winter surface air temperature anomalies	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												The second empirical orthogonal function mode (EOF2) of winter surface air temperature (SAT) over 0 degrees-180 degrees E, 40 degrees-90 degrees N during 1979-2005 is defined as warm Arctic-cold Eurasia (WACE) pattern. The present study evaluates the performance of 25 Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models in simulating the WACE pattern based on historical runs. There exist large inter-model spreads in the simulation of the WACE pattern. Analyses show that the ability of a CMIP5 model in capturing the WACE pattern is connected with the model's performance in representing the observed atmospheric circulation anomalies related to the winter sea ice concentration (SIC) variation over Barents-Kara Seas. Sea ice loss over Barents-Kara Seas can induce significant positive geopotential height anomalies over Arctic region and negative geopotential height anomalies around the Baikal Lake, resulting in warm anomalies over Barents-Kara Seas and cold anomalies over Eurasia. Further analysis shows that CMIP5 model's performance in representing the SAT anomalies related to the WACE pattern is partly due to simulation of the amplitude of winter SIC variability over Barents-Kara Seas. Larger standard deviations of winter SIC over Barents-Kara Seas can instigate stationary wave-train more easily, which further induces the SAT anomalies.

Based on microscopic inspection of slides from 282 adult birds, 20.6% showed infection of H. payevskyi in circulating red blood cells in at least 1 year. For parasite prevalence, there was no difference between years, sex, and age classes. However, parasite intensity was higher in females than in males, and this was most pronounced in 1-year-old birds. Individuals scored to carry parasites in year (n) were more likely to show parasite infection year (n + 1) than birds scored to be parasite-free in year (n) . None of 99 juvenile birds examined at the breeding site in late summer, 4-9 weeks after hatching, showed infection of H. payevskyi. Parasite intensity in infected adult birds decreased in the course of the breeding season and no new or relapse infections were observed during this period. Thus, our data imply that in the great reed warbler, a long-distance migrant to tropical Africa, transmission of H. payevskyi occurs on wintering sites or at stopover sites during migration.

Spring waters are expelled in the vent facies at 71 to 73 degrees C and precipitate mounded travertine composed of aragonite needle botryoids. The apron and channel facies (43-72 degrees C) is floored by hollow tubes composed of aragonite needle botryoids that encrust sulfide-oxidizing Aquificales bacteria. The travertine of the pond facies (30-62 degrees C) varies in composition from aragonite needle shrubs formed at higher temperatures to ridged networks of calcite and aragonite at lower temperatures. Calcite "ice sheets", calcified bubbles, and aggregates of aragonite needles ("fuzzy dumbbells") precipitate at the air-water interface and settle to pond floors. The proximal-slope facies (28-54 degrees C), which forms. the margins of terracette pools, is composed of arcuate aragonite needle shrubs that create small microterracettes on the steep slope face. Finally, the distal-slope facies (28-30 degrees C) is composed of calcite spherules and calcite "feather" crystals. Despite the presence of abundant microbial mat communities and their observed role in providing substrates for mineralization, the com positions of spring-water and travertine predominantly reflect abiotic physical and chemical processes, Vigorous CO2 degassing causes a +2 unit increase in spring water pH, as well as Rayleigh type covariations between the concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon and corresponding delta(13)C. Travertine delta(13)C and delta(18)O are nearly equivalent to aragonite and calcite equilibrium values calculated from spring water in the higher-temperature (similar to 50-73 degrees C) depositional facies. Conversely, travertine precipitating in the lower-temperature (< similar to 50 degrees C) depositional facies exhibits delta(13)C and delta(18)O values that are as much as 4%0 less than predicted equilibrium values, This isotopic shift may record microbial respiration as well as downstream transport of travertine crystals, Despite the production of H2S anti the abundance of sulfide-oxidizing microbes, preliminary delta(34)S data do not uniquely define the microbial metabolic pathways present in the spring system. This suggests that the high extent of CO2 degassing and large open-system solute reservoir in these thermal systems overwhelm biological controls on travertine crystal chemistry.

To attain these goals, it has been necessary to analyze the influence of certain operational parameters and environmental factors on the mass removal rates (MRRs) and the mass removal efficiencies (MREs), depending on if the objective is to maximize nutrient removal or to achieve low effluent concentrations. The system, referred to as FG, operated in a range of hydraulic loading rates (HLRs) from 7 to 58 m year(-1) and removed phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) at an average rate of 7.15 g P m(-2) year(-1) and 60.07 g N m(-2) year(-1). P and N removal varied seasonally, mainly due to input concentrations (C (in)), but inlet mass loading and HLRs also strongly influenced MRRs. Based on these results, we propose to maintain a mean HLR of 58 m year(-1) in winter and 25 m year(-1) in summer to increase annual nutrient removal and thereby barely affecting pumping costs.

J	Doulka, E; Kehayias, G				Doulka, Evangelia; Kehayias, George			Seasonal vertical distribution and diel migration of zooplankton in a temperate stratified lake	BIOLOGIA												The investigation of the vertical distribution of the zooplankton community in the temperate Lake Trichonis during four seasons in 2005, showed the existence of vertical segregation among species, ontogenetic stages and sexes within and between the major groups. In each season, the two or three more abundant rotifer species distributed at separate depth layers, while this feature was maintained during the entire 24 h period, since no diel vertical migrations (DVM) were performed. In contrast, the crustacean community, comprised mainly by the calanoid copepod Eudiaptomus drieschi and the cladoceran Diaphanosoma orghidani, showed various patterns of DVM, being more pronounced in spring and summer. Females of E. drieschi distributed deeper than males, while the copepod nauplii were found mainly in the surface layer in all four seasons. Temperature was the most important abiotic factor affecting directly and indirectly the vertical distribution and migration of various species. During stratification, the metalimnion was the most productive layer in Lake Trichonis, having maximum values of dissolved oxygen and low transparency due to high concentration of organic matter and phytoplankton. The DVM patterns of the crustaceans indicate that the metalimnion acts probably as a daylight refuge against predation by Atherina boyeri, which is the dominant planktivorous fish in the lake.																			0006-3088	1336-9563				APR	2011	66	2					308	319		10.2478/s11756-011-0023-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-011-0023-4													WOS:000287504700016

Avian communities' preferences in recently created agricultural wetlands in irrigated landscapes of semi-arid areas	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Numerous wetlands have been created spontaneously in the Ebro river basin as a consequence of new irrigation developments over the last 50 years. Water used for irrigating farmland drains into the lower parts of small valleys to form wetlands that are mostly dominated by common reed (Phragmites australis). Bird communities established in these wetlands are still simple, partly due to the lack of management to enable their ecological functions to improve. A knowledge of which environmental features favor these bird communities is essential in order to improve the design of newly created or restored wetlands associated to future irrigation developments. For this purpose, the habitat and vegetation features of 15 wetlands have been sampled. The structure of bird communities (richness, abundance and diversity) was monitored over 3 years during the breeding season and in winter at foraging and nocturnal roosting. The presence of bushes, height of stems and distance from large wetlands (> 1 ha) proved to be the most influential variables on bird community structure and on most abundant species during the breeding season. Wetland area and compactness influenced species richness and the most abundant species during winter foraging and roosting. There was a maximum stem height at which only reed-dwelling birds remained. Uncontrolled winter burning had a severe negative effect upon these recently established populations. The ecological functions of newly created or restored wetlands, including those for run-off treatment in agricultural catchments, could be substantially improved taking into account simple guidelines from these results which relate bird community characteristics to wetland features.

The results reveal diverse thermal regimes among these lakes, ranging from cold monomictic to discontinuous cold polymictic and dimictic patterns, reflecting the unique lake responses to their environmental settings. The heat budget of these lakes was predominantly influenced by the strong seasonality of the radiation balance, with latent and sensible heat fluxes consistently exhibiting negative values during the ice-free period, peaking in the summer or late fall. Air temperature and solar radiation were the primary drivers affecting lake thermal structures, at both local and regional scales. The influence of wind speed and cloudiness was more significant for lakes in the treeless tundra, but their regional impact remains relatively weak, along with the impact of precipitation. Additionally, we emphasize the critical role of lake location, geography, and morphology, and particularly altitude, lake size, and water column transparency, in determining changes in stratification and mixing dynamics, overshadowing the influence of lake depth. In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the evolving thermal dynamics of lakes in the European Arctic.

In this research, we present how unimpacted freshwater habitats and the dipteran communities therein deal with changing climate and discharge conditions with regard to community structure. Distinguishing "normal" from "extreme" events and taxa indicative of these periods was made possible only after analyzing long-term data. This research presents how freshwater indicator taxa and local dipteran diversity change significantly with regard to extremes in discharge regimes. Most ecologists have used climate change, as an omnipresent pressure, to support their findings in researching the vulnerability of specific taxa, communities, or ecosystems. However, there is a widespread lack of long-term biological, biocoenological, or community data of periods longer than several years to ascertain patterns as to how climate change affects communities. Since the 1950s, southern Europe has faced an ongoing trend of drying and loss of precipitation. A 13-year research program in the Dinaric karst ecoregion of Croatia aimed to comprehensively track emergence patterns of freshwater insects (true flies: Diptera) in a pristine aquatic environment. Three sites, spring, upper, and lower tufa barriers (calcium carbonate barriers on a barrage lake system that act as natural damns), were sampled monthly over 154 months. This coincided with a severe drought event in 2011/2012. This was the most significant drought (very low precipitation rates for an extended period of time) in the Croatian Dinaric ecoregion since the start of detailed records in the early 20th century. Significant shifts in dipteran taxa occurrence were determined using indicator species analysis. Patterns of seasonal and yearly dynamics were presented as Euclidian distance metrics of similarity in true fly community composition compared at increasing time intervals, to ascertain the degree of temporal variability of similarity within the community of a specific site and to define patterns of similarity change over time. Analyses detected significant shifts in community structure linked to changes in discharge regimes, especially to the drought period.					; Ivković, Marija/AAB-1756-2020	Ternjej, Ivancica/0000-0002-7525-3067; Pozojevic, Ivana/0000-0002-4524-3001; Milisa, Marko/0000-0003-3339-0044														2079-7737				APR	2023	12	4							590	10.3390/biology12040590	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology12040590								37106790					WOS:000977101900001

The model was trained using the error backpropagation algorithm and validated for a major catchment that covers 82% of the Bosten Lake basin and has the only available weather and streamflow data. After validating the model it was used to examine the surface hydrology responses to changes of regional temperature and precipitation. Major results showed that because of an additional effect on glacier melt in the upper reach of the basin temperature increase can cause large increases of streamflow. Model results also showed that if the current climate trend continues, the annual strearnflow would increase by 38% of its current volume, and the summer and winter strearnflow would increase by 71.8 and 11.4% of their respective current volume in the next 50-70 years, highlighting challenges for the basin's water resources management and flood protection.																			1084-0699	1943-5584				MAR	2008	13	3					180	183		10.1061/(ASCE)1084-0699(2008)13:3(180)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)1084-0699(2008)13:3(180)													WOS:000253457600009

Field surveys and stable isotope analyses were used to clarify the migratory history of Japanese dace in the Ishida River, inflowing to Lake Biwa. In the field surveys, the number of young of the year (YOY) individuals caught per unit effort (CPUE) by hand net and casting net in the tributary and lake-shore area was calculated. The CPUE peaked from May to July, after the spawning season, thereafter decreasing rapidly, suggesting that YOY Japanese dace migrated downstream to Lake Biwa immediately after emerging, possibly due to the abundant food resources there. From September to November, the CPUE of YOY individuals increased in the lower reaches of the stream, although their stable nitrogen isotope values were variable, in some cases being similar to those recorded in the upper reaches and the lake-shore area. This suggests that some YOY individuals migrate upstream from the lake in autumn. In the present study, the juvenile migration pattern of fluvial-lacustrine Japanese dace in Lake Biwa was described using a CPUE survey and delta N-15 and delta C-13 analyses.					; Mizuno, Toshiaki/GWR-2749-2022	Mizuno, Toshiaki/0000-0002-1923-6158; 													1341-8998	1616-3915				NOV	2021	68	4					496	505		10.1007/s10228-021-00804-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10228-021-00804-7		FEB 2021											WOS:000618971600001

The environmental preferences of the new species, as assessed by the comparative analysis of these sites, appear to be quite distinctive. These freshwater habitats are fed by drainage basins dominated by dolomite lithology with medium mineralization, are oligotrophic, and are affected by seasonal desiccation.

J	Mokhov, II; Semenov, VA; Khon, VC				Mokhov, II; Semenov, VA; Khon, VC			Estimates of possible regional hydrologic regime changes in the 21st century based on global climate models	IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS												Numerical results of global climate models are used to infer possible changes in regional hydrologic cycle characteristics, including precipitation and river runoff, in the 21st century. Both coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models and a climatic model of intermediate complexity, forced by scenarios of an anthropogenic increase in the atmospheric greenhouse cyas content, are used. The model results show that the precipitation amounts considerably increase in the high latitudes, in particular, over Eurasia, under anthropogenic warming in the 21st century. This is associated primarily with a large increase in the winter precipitation intensity, especially over northeastern Eurasia. The changes in summer precipitation differ widely, with a large neoative trend occurring in the midlatitudes. This trend is associated with corresponding changes in the probability of wet days. Despite a decline in summer precipitation over a large Eurasian region, the precipitation intensity increases. The relative contribution of intense precipitation to the total precipitation amount increases as well. Model estimates are presented for possible changes occurring in the 21st century in precipitation and river runoff over various regions, including the basins of the Volga, the Caspian Sea, the Neva, Lake Ladoga, the Ob, Yenisei, and Lena rivers. On the whole, the precipitation and runoff in these basins, as well as their variability, are found to generally increase in the 21st century against the background of considerable interannual and interdecadal variability. The average runoffs of the Volga, Ob, Yenisei, and Neva rivers somewhat decline in the first half of the 21st century in the general circulation climate models, whereas no such decline is found for the Lena runoff.

It is well known that POC belong to the category of synthetic substances produced by industry and due to their characteristics they are included in the "Long term persistent substances List". The problem of POC degradation is a very complex one, involving photochemical as well as biological aspects, sometimes requiring long period of time. Taking that into consideration, the harmonization of target values for POC with real bearing capacity of environmental factors becomes a priority for aquatic ecosystems as regards ecological risk decrease and environmental protection. The lakes in the surrounding area of Bucharest are damaged by the anthropogenic impact added to the specific features of the geographical area. Such is the case of Moara Domneasca lake located on the Pasarea river. The investigations were performed in the spring-autumn sampling campaigns of the period 2008-2009. The data obtained from the POC analysis show a long term pollution caused by agricultural activities which can increase the risk for the lake ecosystem if they are not properly monitored.																			2285-5785	2285-5807					2010	53						161	166																WOS:000416368600024
J	Bonny, S; Jones, B				Bonny, S; Jones, B			Relict tufa at Miette Hot Springs, Jasper National Park, Alberta, Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												At the Miette Hot Springs site, relict tufa stretches for nearly 500 m along the west side of Sulphur Creek valley and rises up to 30 m above the valley floor. The tufa, composed of low-Mg calcite, precipitated from waters discharged from a line of perched springs. C-14 dating of bone material embedded in the tufa indicates that tufa precipitation took place between similar to4500 and 2500 years BP under cool and moist climatic conditions. The spring biota was dominated by filamentous microbes (mainly Phormidium and Oscillatoria), with fewer diatoms (including Cymbella), testate protozoans (including Quadrulella), ostracodes (including Darwinula, Heterocypris, Cadonia, and Cyclocypris), and various bryophytes. The ecological preferences of these microbes indicate that the spring water had near-neutral pH, was Ca, HCO3, and H2S-SO4 rich, and emerged at 50-65degreesC. Landslides disrupted the west wall of Sulphur Creek valley during and after tufa growth. The relict tufa is divided into six morphotypes that reflect variations in water flow down the steep and rugged flow path. Domal tufa is located around the spring vents, roll-over tufa developed where water flowed over sharp lips or structural barricades, vertical tufa formed where calcite was precipitate from water flowing down steep to vertical inclines, flat-banded tufa reflects precipitation on a gentle slope, and wedge-shaped tufa formed where more rapid downslope calcite precipitation caused a progressive decrease in slope. The tufa contains stromatolitic facies (including streamer, porous laminar, dense laminar) and nonstromatolitic facies (bedded, crenulated) that reflect variations in the biology, water temperature, and style of flow of different parts of the spring flow path.

J	DeCoursey, PJ; Krulas, JR				DeCoursey, PJ; Krulas, JR			Behavior of SCN-lesioned chipmunks in natural habitat: A pilot study	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS												The necessity of a circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), for survival was evaluated in a population of approximately 65 wild eastern chipmunks, Tamias striatus. The research involved over 3000 h of fieldwork between May 1995 and October 1997 on a study site at Mountain Lake Biological Station, Virginia. The 28 chipmunks randomly designated as project animals included 10 SCN-lesioned chipmunks, 5 surgical controls (shamlesioned), and 13 intact controls. Visual observation, live trapping, and radio telemetric tracking were used to assess 6 aspects of survival and reproduction. Upon release after surgery, every animal returned to its den site and was able to maintain its home territory. In warm months from May through October, all chipmunks were active above ground with a strictly day-active pattern. During the remaining cold months, they were normothermic but relatively torpid in their underground dens for extended periods of time. Short-term mortality for the initial 3 months included only a single intact control chipmunk; loss for the extended period from August 1995 to October 1996 was 40% for the SCN-lesioned animals, 0% for surgical controls, and 15.4% for the intact controls. Survival differences were not significant between surgical control and intact control groups but were significant (alpha = .10) between SCN-lesioned and pooled control groups. Annual body weight patterns were similar for both groups. Most individuals in both SCN-lesioned and control groups were reproductively active in the spring and fall breeding periods. Lack of major differences may be attributable to the exceptionally favorable conditions for survival such as a very abundant fall acorn crop, medium population size, and absence of heavy predation.																			0748-7304	1552-4531				JUN	1998	13	3					229	244		10.1177/074873098129000075	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/074873098129000075								9615287					WOS:000073830600006

The Neolithic human occupation of the Serteyka lake-river system responded to climate oscillations, resulting in the development of a pile-dwelling settlement between 5.9 and 4.2 ka cal BP. In this paper, we present the quantitative paleoclimatic reconstructions of the Northgrippian stage (8.2-4.2 ka cal BP) from the Great Serteya Palaeolake Basin. The reconstructions were created based on a multiproxy (Chironomidae, pollen and Cladocera) approach. The mean July air temperature remained at 17-20 degrees C, which is similar to the present temperature in the Smolensk Upland. The summer temperature revealed only weak oscillations during 5.9 and 4.2 ka cal BP. A more remarkable feature during those events was an increase in continentality, manifested by a lower winter temperature and lower annual precipitation. During the third, intermediate oscillation in 5.0-4.7 ka cal BP, a rise in summer temperature and stronger shifts in continental air masses were recorded. It is still unclear if the above-described climate fluctuations are linked to the North Atlantic Oscillation and can be interpreted as an indication of Bond events because only a few high-resolution paleoclimatic reconstructions from the region have been presented and these reconstructions do not demonstrate explicit oscillations in the period of 5.9 and 4.2 ka cal BP.					; Antczak-Orlewska, Olga/E-4587-2017; Płóciennik, Mateusz/R-1232-2018; Pawlowski, Dominik/KCZ-1312-2024; Gauthier, Emilie/C-6640-2013; Plociennik, Mateusz/R-1232-2018; Nazarova, Larisa/C-8926-2014; Kittel, Piotr/F-5586-2013; Syrykh, Liudmila/K-8331-2018; Gruszczyńska, Agnieszka/AGX-6093-2022	Syrykh, Liudmila/0000-0003-2076-8570; Antczak-Orlewska, Olga/0000-0001-9392-623X; Gruszczynska, Agnieszka/0000-0002-3534-7843; Pawlowski, Dominik/0000-0003-4616-6666; Luoto, Tomi/0000-0001-6925-3688; Gauthier, Emilie/0000-0002-9238-8190; Plociennik, Mateusz/0000-0003-1487-6698; Nazarova, Larisa/0000-0003-4145-9689; Kittel, Piotr/0000-0001-6987-7968; Kotrys, Bartosz/0000-0002-2732-6970; 														2073-4441				JUN	2021	13	11							1611	10.3390/w13111611	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13111611													WOS:000660835400001
J	Egan, AT; Moon, RD				Egan, Alexander T.; Moon, Roger D.			Insects Associated With Droppings of Moose, Alces alces (L), in Isle Royale National Park, Michigan	GREAT LAKES ENTOMOLOGIST												Moose (Alces alces [L]) droppings were sampled in June-August, 2007, in Isle Royale National Park, a remote wilderness island in Lake Superior, to characterize biodiversity of the park's moose dung fauna. Twelve Diptera and nine Coleoptera species were obtained, for a total of 21 insect taxa. Twenty of the taxa are newly recorded colonists or visitors to moose dung. The Diptera were Psychodidae, Anthomyiidae, Muscidae and representatives of three other families, and Coleoptera consisted of three species in each of Scarabaeidae, Staphylinidae and Histeridae. Species per sample ranged from two in early June to nine in mid-July, and a species accumulation curve indicated a total of six more species remain to be detected. The relatively depauparate nature of the island's dung insect fauna may be attributed to absence of other large herbivores,. to geographic isolation from source populations on adjacent mainland, or to distinct physical or biological properties of moose dung. Among reared specimens, Hylemyza partita (Meigen) (Anthomyiidae) and moose fly, Haematobosca alcis (Snow) (Muscidae) required approximately 3 weeks to complete development from egg to adult. Projections from weather records on the island indicated the two species could have completed as many as five generations between dates of last spring frost in May and first autumn frost in November.

This study utilized remote sensing and machine learning to analyze water quality parameters, including the permanganate index, total phosphorus (TP), and turbidity, in Liangzi Lake (Hubei's second-largest lake) from 2019 to 2022. A spatial quantification model and statistical analysis were employed to assess human activity intensity at different buffer scales (1,000-4,000 m) and identify key influencing factors. Results showed significant seasonal and annual variations in water quality, with the highest pollution in autumn and the lowest in winter. Pollution levels decreased from 2019 to 2020 but gradually increased from 2020 to 2022, possibly related to changes in human activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Spatially, the Gaotang sub-lake had the highest permanganate index and TP pollution, while the Manjiang sub-lake had the highest turbidity. Precipitation and livestock density were the primary factors, accounting for 26.7-30.8% and 12.9-17.6% of water quality variation, respectively. At the 1,000 m and 2,000-4,000 m buffer zones, industrial output and population density were the dominant human activity factors influencing water quality. This study provides practical insights for targeted lake management strategies and environmental protection efforts.

Instar analysis based on larval head capsule length and width reveals five instars. The growth rate of successive larval instars remains nearly constant around 1.4, thus following Brooks' rule. Larvae hatch in July and August; the first hibernation occurs mainly during the third instar. Larvae develop to the fourth instar by the next summer and hibernate a second time as fifth instars. The last larval instar leaves the water at the end of May and pupates in the soil. The appproximately two-months flight period of the imagines begins around the middle of June. Females lay their eggs on the undersides of leaves of littoral trees, from which the hatching larvae fall into the water.																			0165-0424						2001	23	2					85	92		10.1076/aqin.23.2.85.4920	http://dx.doi.org/10.1076/aqin.23.2.85.4920													WOS:000167570700001

Yet, little is known about the fungal community in lake sediment. In this study, sediment samples from five habitat types in Baiyangdian Lake (BYD Lake) were collected across three seasons. High-throughput sequencing techniques were used to determine the compositions of fungal communities. Fungi are highly diverse in the sediment of BYD Lake, although some important fungi have not been accurately identified. The fungal diversity was highest in winter and lowest in summer, while there was no significant difference in species richness among sampling sites. The compositions of fungal community differed among seasons and habitats. Physicochemical properties of sediments were measured and the influence of the environmental factors on fungal communities were analyzed. Temperature, P, N, and heavy metals explained 48.98% of the variations of fungal communities across three seasons. Human activities have affected the species and biomass of fungi to some extent. Temperature is the most influential factor and negatively correlated to fungal diversity. Nutrients in different forms have different effects on shaping the fungal community. The effect of heavy metals is relatively low.																				2076-2607				NOV	2024	12	11							2127	10.3390/microorganisms12112127	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms12112127								39597517					WOS:001365576500001

Much of the region has a humid, warm temperate climate with little seasonality in precipitation but strong seasonality in runoff owing to high rates of summer evapotranspiration. The climate of southern Florida and eastern Mexico is subtropical with a distinct summer wet season and winter dry season. Regional climate models suggest that climate change resulting from a doubling of the pre-industrial levels of atmospheric CO2 may increase annual air temperatures by 3-4 degrees C. Changes in precipitation are highly uncertain, but the most probable scenario shows higher levels over all but the northern, interior portions of the region, with increases primarily occurring in summer and occurring as more intense or clustered storms. Despite the increases in precipitation, runoff is likely to decline over much of the region owing to increases in evapotranspiration exceeding increases in precipitation. Only in Florida and the Gulf Coast areas of the US and Mexico are precipitation increases likely to exceed evapotranspiration increases, producing an increase in runoff. However, increases in storm intensity and clustering are likely to result in more extreme hydrographs, with larger peaks in flow but lower baseflows and longer periods of drought. The ecological effects of climate change on freshwaters of the region include: (1) a general increase in rates of primary production, organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling as a result of higher temperatures and longer growing seasons: (2) reduction in habitat for cool water species, particularly fish and macroinvertebrates in Appalachian streams; (3) reduction in water quality and in suitable habitat in summer owing to lower baseflows and intensification of the temperature-dissolved oxygen squeeze in many rivers and reservoirs; (4) reduction in organic matter storage and loss of organisms during more intense flushing events in some streams and wetlands; (5) shorter periods of inundation of riparian wetlands and greater drying of wetland soils, particularly in northern and inland areas; (6) expansion of subtropical species northwards, including several non-native nuisance species currently confined to southern Florida; (7) expansion of wetlands in Florida and coastal Mexico, but increase in eutrophication of Florida lakes as a result of greater runoff from urban and agricultural areas; and (8) changes in the flushing rate of estuaries that would alter their salinity regimes, stratification and water quality as well as influence productivity in the Gulf of Mexico. Many of the expected climate change effects will exacerbate current anthropogenic stresses on the region's freshwater systems, including increasing demands for water, increasing waste heat loadings and land use changes that alter the quantity and quality of runoff to streams and reservoirs. Research is needed especially in several critical areas: long-term monitoring of key hydrological, chemical and biological properties (particularly water balances in small, forested catchments and temperature-sensitive species); experimental studies of the effects of warming on organisms and ecosystem processes under realistic conditions (e.g. in situ heating experiments): studies of the effects of natural hydrological variation on biological communities; and assessment of the effects of water management activities on organisms and ecosystem processes, including development and testing of management and restoration strategies designed to counteract changes in climate.

CO2 supersaturation in lakes, which results in CO2 emissions, is frequently attributed to CO2 produced within the lake4-8. However, lateral inorganic carbon flux through watersheds can also be sizeable(9-11). Here we calculated lake surface water CO2 concentrations and emissions using lake pH, alkalinity and temperature from a compilation of data from 5,118 boreal lakes(12). Autumn surface water CO2 concentrations and CO2 emissions from the 5,118 lakes co-varied with lake internal autumn CO2 production. However, using a mass balance approach we found that CO2 emission in the majority of lakes was sustained by inorganic carbon loading from the catchment rather than by internal CO2 production. Small lakes with high dissolved organic carbon and phosphorus concentrations, shorter retention times and longer ice-free seasons had the highest CO2 concentrations. CO2 emissions from these small lakes was twice that of comparable lakes in colder regions, and similar to emissions from subtropical and tropical lakes. We conclude that changes in land use and climate that increase dissolved inorganic carbon may cause emission levels from boreal lakes to approach those of lakes in warmer regions.

J	Bezgodova, OV				Bezgodova, Olga, V			CHANNEL MORPHODYNAMICS OF THE MOUTH SECTION OF THE OLHA RIVER OVER A TEN-YEAR PERIOD	GEOSFERNYE ISSLEDOVANIYA-GEOSPHERE RESEARCH												This article discusses the analysis of channel morphodynamics of the mouth section of the Olha River during 2009-2018 within the Shelekhovsky district of Irkutsk region (52 degrees 21'64.2 '' N; 104 degrees 13'65.8 '' E). The channel morphodynamics of the most developed small rivers has practically not been studied at the moment in the East Siberian region. Analysis of field and cartographic material, literature sources, as well as remote sensing data and satellite images made it possible to identify seven areas with three types of channel processes (Fig. 1), among which the following areas turned out to be the most dynamic . artificially straightened section of the channel in Olha village area, drained oxbow complex in Energetik garden partnership area, periodically drained section of the channel in the area of lake-like extension with degrading channel and oxbow lakes. The following floodplain-channel types were identified: a wide-floodplain meandering type of channel with free meandering bends, a meandering with adapted bends, as well as an adapted relatively straight type of channel. The climatic, geological-geomorphological and anthropogenic factors have the greatest impact on the dynamics of channel processes; the latter has made significant changes in the structure and type of the floodplain of the Olha mouth section during the study period. Additional calculations of the main morphometric parameters made it possible to determine the degree of bends development and the ratio of length to deflection arrow (see table). Calculations showed that for 2009-2018 there was a decrease in the degree of river meandering, a general decrease in the channel tortuosity and frequency of floodplain flooding, especially in areas of free meandering with a high degree of anthropogenic transformation. The analysis of the graphs of average daily flow rate and water level, flow rate of suspended and bed load sediment, as well as turbidity of the Olha River (Figs. 2 and 3) showed that the main increase in water flow in the river falls on the periods of spring floods and flash floods (May and August ). The disturbance in phenomena sequence was revealed: the first maximum of water level falls on March, while the first maximum of water discharges in May. The maximum water turbidity is observed in May, which is associated with passage of spring flood; the minimum falls on June. These values are correlated with the schedule of suspended and bed loads, passing the same maximums and minimums. Human economic activity led to decrease in frequency of floodplain flooding within the floodplain of the Olha River, which affected the area and number of oxbow lakes (Fig. 4). The process of floodplain type changing is observed from segmented-ridged type to segmented flat type.																			2542-1379	2541-9943				MAR	2022		1					98	106		10.17223/25421379/22/7	http://dx.doi.org/10.17223/25421379/22/7													WOS:000782281400007

Reproduction of Cichla kelberi Kullander and Ferreira, 2006 introduced into an artificial lake in southeastern Brazil	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												The objective of this study was to characterize the reproduction of Cichla kelberi in an artificial lake, located in the municipality of Leme, in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Breeding occurred in spring, and summer. The L-50 and the L-100 of this species were 192 and 235 mm (L-50), for males and females, respectively, and 290 mm (L-100) for both sexes. Spawning was parceled. The oocytes matured at a size of 428.4 mu m, reaching their maximum at 2,203.2 mu m. A mean of fecundity were of 12,129.2 oocytes, with the mean of oocytes in each batch of 4,897.7. This species has external fertilization, is nonmigratory, and with parental care of the young. Various attributes of the peacock bass make their introduction a temptation. However, due to their feeding and reproductive characteristics, they have no natural predators, making it difficult to control their population growth or eradicate them.																			1519-6984	1678-4375				FEB	2009	69	1					175	183		10.1590/S1519-69842009000100023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-69842009000100023								19347162					WOS:000265112300022

However, detailed studies focused on environmental variability experienced by postflexion larvae entering a range of estuary types under varying conditions are rare. This study assessed the in situ conditions (temperature, salinity and water clarity) under which the southern African endemic fish Rhabdosargus holubi (Sparidae) recruits into estuaries. Postflexion larvae were sampled in three biogeographic regions (cool temperate, warm temperate and subtropical boundary), which included three estuary types (permanently open estuaries (POEs), temporarily open/closed estuaries and estuarine lake systems) on a seasonal basis, independent of each other. Rhabdosargus holubi larvae were more abundant in spring and summer, in POEs in the warm temperate region. Models predicted that higher larval occurrence in estuaries is a function of lower salinity (e.g. mesohaline zones of 5-17.9 salinity) and lower water clarity (e.g. 0-0.2 K-d, light extinction coefficient), particularly for warm, temperate POEs. This re-emphasizes the importance of freshwater for optimal nursery functioning, which may be compromised by impoundments, abstraction and climate change in water-short countries like South Africa.

J	Gozdziejewska, AM; Kruk, M				Gozdziejewska, Anna Maria; Kruk, Marek			The response of zooplankton network indicators to winter water warming using shallow artificial reservoirs as model case study	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												To predict the most likely scenarios, the consequences of the rise in water surface temperature have been studied using various methods. We tested the hypothesis that winter water warming significantly alters the importance and nature of the relationships in zooplankton communities in shallow reservoirs. These relationships were investigated using network graph analysis for three thermal variants: warm winters (WW), moderate winters (MW) and cold winters (CW). The CW network was the most cohesive and was controlled by eutrophic Rotifera and Copepoda, with a corresponding number of positive and negative interspecific relationships. An increase in water temperature in winter led to a decrease in the centrality of MW and WW networks, and an increase in the importance of species that communicated with the highest number of species in the subnetworks. The WW network was the least cohesive, controlled by psammophilous and phytophilous rotifers, and littoral cladocerans. Adult copepods were not identified in the network and the importance of antagonistic relationships decreased, indicating that the WW network structure was weak and unstable. This study can serve as a model for generalisations of zooplankton community response to the disappearance of long winter periods of low temperatures, as predicted in global climate change projections.					; Kruk, Marek/I-8348-2012; Goździejewska, Anna/U-6857-2019	Kruk, Marek/0000-0001-8806-863X; 													2045-2322					OCT 21	2023	13	1							18002	10.1038/s41598-023-45430-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-45430-7								37865664					WOS:001138708200001

However, the issue of ABx contamination in aquatic ecosystems of densely populated megacities remains largely overlooked. Significant research gaps persist, particularly in understanding the full-chain pollution characteristics that span from urban aquatic environments to edible aquatic organisms, due in part to the lack of systematic monitoring data to support comprehensive assessments. To address this gap, this study conducts the first comprehensive screening of ABx in the aquatic ecosystems of a megacity, offering quantitative evaluations of ABx complexity and multidimensional heterogeneity. Over a one-year period, 406 samples were collected from four rivers and three lakes, and large-scale analyses identified 37 ABx compounds, with the overall detection rate of 30.05 %, with Sulfonamides (SAs), Quinolones (QNs), and Macrolides (MLs) being the most prevalent. Surface water samples contained the greatest number of ABx types, while amphibians exhibited the highest detection rate and concentrations. A pronounced increase in detections during the dry season (spring and winter) highlighted substantial spatio-temporal variation. Source-sink analysis revealed hospital effluents and wastewater treatment plants as primary pollution sources. Among the detected compounds, Nalidixic acid (NCA), Sulfamethazine (SMTZ), Flumequine (FQ), and Tylosin (TLS) posed the most significant ecological risks, with NCA identified as a priority for targeted control. This study establishes a novel framework for the high-throughput suspect screening, occurrence pattern analysis, and risk assessment of ABx in megacities worldwide.

J	VALTONEN, T; LAITINEN, M				VALTONEN, T; LAITINEN, M			ACID STRESS IN RESPECT TO CALCIUM AND MAGNESIUM CONCENTRATIONS IN THE PLASMA OF PERCH DURING MATURATION AND SPAWNING	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Plasma calcium and magnesium concentrations in perch, Perca fluviatilis, were monitored in an acid lake. Lake Iso Tenhetty (pH .apprx. 5, Al concentrations 0.3-0.5 mg l-1) compared with a nearby reference lake, Lake Paijanne, in Southern Finland. The effect of acid stress could be noticed as 1/3 lower fecundity of perch in the acid lake. Plasma Ca concentrations were temporarily lower in the middle of the winter in the fish of the acid lake, and in April-May samples the situation was opposite. Plasma Mg concentration was also lower in the perch from the acid lake in midwinter months, when compared with the double as high values (.apprx. 3 mmol l-1) from the reference lake. Elevated level of plasma Mg have been reported for fish in cold acclimation especially in winter. Thus overwintering may be specially stressing for some specimens in acid waters. Also ova did contain clearly less magnesium in the midwinter sample from the acid lake perch compared with the reference lake sample. This difference, however, was no more to be found later in spring. Mg content in the ova of perch was in both cases high, which may be necessary to the breeding in comparable acid waters. According to the literature fish cannot increase their magnesium content directly from the water. Mortality for the reference lake embryos was lower than those of the acid lake when incubated in the acid lake. No physiological acclimation inside the fish could be demonstrated in this case.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				JUN	1988	22	2					147	154		10.1007/BF00001544	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00001544													WOS:A1988N276000006
J	Yuan, J; Huang, YF; Nie, ZJ; Hofmann, R				Yuan, Jie; Huang, Yifeng; Nie, Zhijie; Hofmann, Ronald			The effect of water temperature on the removal of 2-methylisoborneol and geosmin by preloaded granular activated carbon	WATER RESEARCH												Granular activated carbon (GAC) is widely used by drinking water treatment plants in the Great Lakes region to control 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) and geosmin associated with summertime algal blooms. Recently, however, taste and odour events are being detected in the winter, but there is limited information in the literature about the effect of temperature on GAC performance. In this study, batch isotherm experiments were conducted at 4 degrees C, 10 degrees C, and 20 degrees C to evaluate the temperature impact on adsorption thermodynamics. Pilot-scale column tests were then performed at the same temperatures to evaluate the temperature effect on overall removal, including both thermodynamics and kinetics. The pore and surface diffusion model (PSDM) was applied to fit the experimental data of the pilot-scale column tests, which allowed the kinetic parameters to be determined at each temperature. The isotherm results showed that water temperature did not have a significant effect on the equilibrium adsorption capacity (i.e., the thermodynamics) for MIB and geosmin under the conditions tested, but the pilot tests showed an increased removal of MIB and geosmin by 20-30% at 20 degrees C compared to the lower temperatures. This demonstrates that water temperature has more impact on kinetics than thermodynamics. Numerical simulations showed that the overall external mass transfer coefficient, K-f', had the greatest impact on breakthrough. An exponential equation was proposed to correlate temperature and K-f', and it could be incorporated into a site-specific PSDM to predict the removals of MIB and geosmin in GAC contactors at different temperatures. The model could then be used by a utility, for example, to predict the required increase in empty bed contact time needed to control taste and odour in the winter to the same extent as in the summer.

J	Peck, AM; Hornbuckle, KC				Peck, AM; Hornbuckle, KC			Gas-phase concentrations of current-use pesticides in Iowa	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Local and regional atmospheric transport of current-use pesticides is an important source of these compounds to nontarget plants and ecosystems. Current-use pesticides were measured at urban, rural, and suburban sites in eastern Iowa during 2000-2002. The most detected compounds were hexachlorobenzene and trifluralin, which were found in 89% and 78% of the samples, respectively. As expected many pesticides showed a strong seasonal trend with the most detections and highest concentrations occurring during the spring and early summer. The average detected concentrations of five heavily used herbicides were 0.52 ng/m(3) for trifluralin, 4.6 ng/m(3) for acetochlor, 2.3 ng/m(3) for metolachlor, 1.1 ng/m(3) for alachlor, 1.7 ng/m(3) for pendimethalin, and 1.2 ng/m(3) for atrazine. The most frequently detected insecticides were phorate and chlorpyrifos, which were found in 20% and 19% of the samples, respectively. The average phorate and chlorpyrifos concentrations were 25 ng/m(3) and 1.0 ng/m(3) respectively. The maximum phorate concentration, the highest measured for all pesticides, was 91.2 ng/m(3). The most frequently detected current-use fungicides were chloroneb and etridiazole, which were found in 14% and 10% of the samples, respectively.

J	Raynolds, MK; Comiso, JC; Walker, DA; Verbyla, D				Raynolds, Martha K.; Comiso, Josefino C.; Walker, Donald A.; Verbyla, David			Relationship between satellite-derived land surface temperatures, arctic vegetation types, and NDVI	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Arctic vegetation distribution is largely controlled by climate, particularly summer temperatures. Summer temperatures have been increasing in the Arctic and this trend is expected to continue. Arctic vegetation has been shown to change in response to increases in summer temperatures, which in turn affects arctic fauna, human communities and industries. An understanding of the relationship of existing plant communities to temperature is important in order to monitor change effectively. In addition, variation along existing climate gradients can help predict where and how vegetation changes may occur as climate warming continues. In this study we described the spatial relationship between satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST), circumpolar arctic vegetation, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). LST, mapped as summer warmth index (SWI), accurately portrayed temperature gradients due to latitude, elevation and distance from the coast. The SWI maps also reflected NDVI patterns, though NDVI patterns were more complex due to the effects of lakes, different substrates and different-aged glacial surfaces. We found that for the whole Arctic, a 5 degrees C increase in SWI along the climate gradient corresponded to an increase in NDVI of approximately 0.07. This result supports and is of similar magnitude as temporal studies showing increases of arctic NDVI corresponding to increases in growing season temperatures over the length of the satellite record. The strongest positive relationship between NDVI and SWI occurred in partially vegetated and graminoid vegetation types. Recently deglaciated areas, areas with many water bodies, carbonate soil areas, and high mountains had lower NDVI values than predicted by SWI. Plant growth in these areas was limited by substrate factors as well as temperature, and thus is likely to respond less to climate warming than other areas. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

According to the available observation and remote sensing data, the features of the water temperature in the Danube Delta, as well as in nearby lakes and the adjacent area of the Black Sea, have been determined. The water temperature in the Danube River was found to be much higher than the air temperature, especially in autumn. Generally, it is also higher than in nearby lakes and the adjacent part of the Black Sea. During 1961-2021 the mean annual water temperature in the Danube Delta increased significantly, especially during the last three decades. It has been determined that water temperature is affected not only by air temperature, but also by water discharge and wind. With a large water discharge the mixing of water is intensified and it causes the decrease of surface water temperature during the main part of the year with the exception of the coldest months. The greatest impact of water discharge on the water temperature is observed in June. The cool breeze in summer months also has some effect on the surface water temperature of the river near the seashore. The results show the potential of remote sensing to track the changes of water temperature along the river and to identify the shallow sections.

Larvae of both species of Desmona live in small spring-fed channels of moist alpine meadow habitats in western North America; those of D.mono also have been found in the littoral zone of small alpine lakes. Larvae burrow into sand-gravel substrates for pupation in late summer, emerging as adults in September and October. Diagnostic characters are provided for adults and larvae of the two species of Desmona; a summary of their geographic distribution is included. Desmona and the Holarctic Chilostigma are sister groups, forming with Brachypsyche (Palearctic) and Psychoglypha (Nearctic) a closely related complex within the limnephiline tribe Chilostigmini. Because Psychoglypha mono was the type species of the monobasic subgenus P. (Monophylax) Nimmo, a consequence of its tranfer to Desmona is that Monophylax becomes a junior synonym of Desmona Denning.																			0013-8746	1938-2901				MAR	1990	83	2					155	161		10.1093/aesa/83.2.155	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aesa/83.2.155													WOS:A1990CQ89800005

In a cold oligotrophic fishless habitat, individual Daphnia can live for over a year, several times the usual Daphnia lifespan. This extreme lifespan is in part a consequence of the overwintering strategy which includes storing resources and delaying reproduction until another spring. Yet, contrasting strategies may be applied by Daphnia, resulting in over twofold differences in lifespan within a single habitat. We identify physiological mechanisms mediating such differences in longevity in closely related Daphnia of two lineages coexisting within a high altitude lake, testing the predictions that long-lived animals stay in colder waters and have lower metabolic rates, irrespective of temperature. Vertical distribution of the animals was assessed during three summer stratification seasons, and metabolic activity was measured as oxygen consumption and RNA:DNA ratio. The results not only support our predictions but also reveal that habitat choice is dependent on reproductive status rather than genotype. The young individuals of the overwintering lineage may delay reproduction in part by staying in colder waters than the reproducing adults, which together with low intrinsic metabolic rates may underlie the longevity of Daphnia of this lineage.

Gokceada Salt Lake: a Case Study of Seasonal Dynamics of Wetland Ecological Communities in the Context of Anthropogenic Pressure and Nature Conservation	WETLANDS												Gokceada Salt Lake (GSL) (Gokceada Island, North Aegean Sea) is an important wetland area situated on established bird migratory routes. The waterbody is subject to significant variability in seasonal water quality and species diversity. Monthly observations indicate that a total of 29 waterbird species were present during 2015-2016. Rainfall was observed to influence waterbird abundance. There was also a strong correlation between waterbird and zooplankton species diversity, with water quality a further influencing factor. The seasonal abundance of 78 other aquatic species was also investigated. Spring and fall seasonal eutrophication, as a consequence of canal construction and suspected warming due to climate change has caused changes in Chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand levels and grazing habits of aquatic species. Here, we propose GSL as a coastal lagoon model for a hydrodynamically sensitive habitat undergoing significant change from the combined threats of heavy metal pollution from a waste management facility, pesticide use for tourism and agriculture activity and wider climate impacts. We conclude that our results provide a paradigm for broad-scale monitoring programs encompassing all components of the wetland ecosystem under anthropogenic and climate change pressure, thus providing a tool to support and inform essential management and rehabilitation plans.

The 3 areas are within 30 km of each other and differ in nutrient loading and primary productivity. Consumption rates were obtained by combining abundance estimates of the planktivores (from Bongo nets, gill nets and acoustics) with diet analysis and bioenergetics models. Both the dominating planktivore groups and total planktivory rates changed over the study period. Sprat and yearling herring were the major zooplanktivores in July and August whereas young-of-year herring and M. mixta were more important in September and October. Planktivory rates increased from low levels at the beginning of July to a peak in August coinciding with a late summer decline in crustacean zooplankton biomass. Planktivory rates were lower than estimated zooplankton production rates in July and early August when zooplankton biomass was increasing and similar to or higher than production in the autumn when zooplankton biomass declined. Both clupeids and mysids consistently selected prey in the order cladocerans (Bosmina longispina maritima and Pleopis polyphemoides) > Eurytemora affinis hirundoides copepods > Acartia copepods. The selected species represented a smaller proportion of total zooplankton biomass and decreased earlier in the season in the least productive area, indicating a larger and earlier effect of planktivory in that area compared to the most productive area.

J	Saidi, H; Dresti, C; Manca, D; Ciampittiello, M				Saidi, Helmi; Dresti, Claudia; Manca, Dario; Ciampittiello, Marzia			Climate projections in Lake Maggiore watershed using Statistical DownScaling Model	CLIMATE RESEARCH												Precipitation and temperature over the Lake Maggiore watershed greatly influence its water balance. Local communities from both Italy and Switzerland rely on the watershed for agriculture, tourism and hydropower production. Accurate climate projections in this area are vital in dealing with their impacts and yet are still lacking. Future climate was assessed by applying the Statistical DownScaling Model (SDSM) and using CanESM2 predictors. Three scenarios defined by RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 were adopted. Based on our results, SDSM is to a certain degree applicable for simulating precipitation and temperature in an Alpine area. Results indicate that warming from now until the end of the century will be about 2 to 3 times greater without global mitigation. Temperature is estimated to increase throughout the 21st century, with a stronger warming trend in the northeastern part of the region than in the southwestern part. The strength of the warming at the end of the century highly depends on the scenario considered, with an increase up to 1.7 degrees C for the mitigation scenario RCP2.6 compared to 4.2 degrees C for the unmitigated scenario RCP8.5. Seasonal precipitation is expected to change depending on the future scenarios. Most of the region is expected to display a seasonally positive precipitation change during the cold season and vice versa, resulting in a shift in the peak rainy season from autumn to winter. These findings suggest that the area might be vulnerable to global change and will provide useful insight to develop a better strategy for the management of water resources and to study the adoptive measures to manage flood disasters.

A clearly defined three-layer physical system was observed. Two layers were actively mixed: the surface-mixed layer and the subsurface-mixed layer. Both winds and night-time convection create the surface-mixed layer, and vertical shear due to a counterclockwise gyre maintains turbulence in the subsurface mixing layer. A strongly stratified layer between these two mixing layers is almost turbulence free, so no material flux is expected. A local oxygen maximum layer, a local oxygen minimum layer, and layers of increased chlorophyll and zooplankton abundance are all located in this strongly stratified layer. The data show the intricate influence of physical processes on the structure of biological systems and their combined influence on biogeochemical and trophic transfers in aquatic systems.					; Doubell, Mark/F-2884-2016; YAMAZAKI, Hidekatsu/O-1899-2014; NAGAI, Takeyoshi/O-1926-2014; AMAKASU, Kazuo/O-1857-2014	Homma, Hikaru/0000-0002-4125-220X; Doubell, Mark/0000-0003-3272-9659; Nagai, Takeyoshi/0000-0001-6400-878X													1439-8621					APR	2010	11	1					63	70		10.1007/s10201-009-0288-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-009-0288-2													WOS:000274212800007
J	Gandin, A; Capezzuoli, E				Gandin, Anna; Capezzuoli, Enrico			Travertine: Distinctive depositional fabrics of carbonates from thermal spring systems	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The terrestrial limestones forming at the emergence of thermal springs show a variety of unusual depositional facies. The specific lithological and petrological features of these deposits have few counterparts in the marine, and continental, karst-related carbonates, but they are typical of the epigean limestone that has been quarried since antiquity in the surroundings of Tivoli (Rome) under the name of travertine, where it is still forming in hydro-geothermal fields linked to extensional tectonics. The physicochemical, hydrodynamic and geological conditions specific to the Tivoli thermal spring system imply hypersaturated alkaline-sulphate, warm to hot waters, upwelling from springs fed through open fractures/faults in extensional and/or volcanic regimes. These features, together with the hydrodynamic behaviour of the water flows running from the vents, control the petrogenetic features of the travertine, a well-bedded, mostly finely laminated, porous but quite compact limestone. The results of a detailed comparative petrological analysis carried out on the lithofacies of travertine limestones, and of those observed during formation within numerous active thermal spring fields, provide the elements required for an exhaustive textural classification of the travertine lithofacies, which has not yet been described systematically. According to the genetic processes and fabrics, the thermal deposits that originate from such hypersaturated alkaline-sulphate, warm to hot waters, can be subdivided into: abiotic crystalline crusts, microbially mediated crusts (microbialites) and granular deposits mostly represented by small accumulations of lime-mudstone. Some of the granular deposits and the microbialites are only partially comparable with analogous sediments forming on tidal flats/sabkhas or other continental sites; however, the facies association of crystalline crusts and laminar curled microbialites has no counterpart in the marine realm. The widespread presence of thermophile bacteria and sulphobacteria, and the general absence of autochthonous eukaryote organisms, unable to live in poisonous sulphate waters, are also undeniable evidence of their thermal origin.

J	LYONS, J				LYONS, J			DISTRIBUTION, ABUNDANCE, AND MORTALITY OF SMALL LITTORAL-ZONE FISHES IN SPARKLING LAKE, WISCONSIN	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												During 1982 and 1983, seining, fyke netting, and SCUBA observation were used to determine the depth distribution, abundance, and mortality of small littoral-zone fishes (bluntnose minnows, shiners [primarily mimic shiners], yellow perch, logperch, johnny darters, Iowa darters, and mottled sculpins) in Sparkling Lake, a small moderately-productive lake in northern Wisconsin [USA]. During the summer cyprinids, darters, and mottled sculpins were most abundant in areas shallower than 1 m, while yellow perch were most abundant at depths of 2 to 4 m. Between August and October cyprinids and yellow perch moved to water 1 to 2 m deeper, while the depth distributions of darters and mottle sculpins generally remained unchanged. Large within- and between-year variations in abundances and mortality rates were evident for all species. In 1982, most of the mortality of cyprinids and darters occurred during a short period in late spring and early summer, with relatively little afterwards. In 1983, this pattern was reversed for cyprinids and Iowa darters, but not logperch and johnny darters. Between-year differences in abundance were greatest for young-of-the-year yellow perch; they were 400 times more numerous in 1983 than 1982. Darters had their lowest mortality rates and highest reproductive success in 1983, while the opposite was true for cyprinids. This lack of synchrony between darters and cyprinids suggests that these two taxa responded differently to changes in environmental conditions in Sparkling Lake. Predation may have accounted for much of the variability in darter population parameters, but appeared to be a less important source of variation for cyprinid population parameters.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				FEB	1987	18	2					93	107		10.1007/BF00002598	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00002598													WOS:A1987G206000002

BULLETIN FRANCAIS DE LA PECHE ET DE LA PISCICULTURE					1st International Conference on European Shads	MAY, 2000	BORDEAUX, FRANCE	Continental Aquat Resources Unit, INRA ENSAR, Univ Porto, French Fisheries Council				Seasonal, diurnal and size-dependent trends of food composition, prey selection and daily ration of juvenile twaite shad were investigated in the! Elbe estuary. Juvenile twaite shad were caught for diet analysis with framed gape stow nets in the mesohaline region of the Elbe estuary in April, July and August 1991 Copepods, mysids and fish were identified as main food items of juvenile twaite shad. In August, the importance of mysids and fish as main prey organisms increased with increasing total length of twaite shad, whereas the proportion of copepods decreased. During night fishes were consumed to a lesser extent than during day. Insects were mainly eaten during night. In the early morning copepods were main food items. Juvenile twaite shad preferred the mysidacean Mesopodopsis slabbed and the sprat Sprattus sprattus. Cladocerans were ingested corresponding to their availability, whereas all other food items were avoided. Daily,ration according to WINBERG (1956) showed peak values in spring and summer and decreased during the following season. The maximum daily ration of about 45% of body wet weight was calculated in May. Daily ration decreased with increasing age of juvenile twaite shad.																			0767-2861						2001		362-63					785	800		10.1051/kmae:2001019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae:2001019													WOS:000173701400005

Subdecadal phytolith and charcoal records from Lake Malawi, East Africa imply minimal effects on human evolution from the ∼74 ka Toba supereruption	JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION												The temporal proximity of the similar to 74 ka Toba supereruption to a putative 100-50 ka human population bottleneck is the basis for the volcanic winter/weak Garden of Eden hypothesis, which states that the eruption caused a 6-year-long global volcanic winter and reduced the effective population of anatomically modern humans (AMH) to fewer than 10,000 individuals. To test this hypothesis, we sampled two cores collected from Lake Malawi with cryptotephra previously fingerprinted to the Toba supereruption. Phytolith and charcoal samples were continuously collected at similar to 3-4 mm (similar to 8-9 yr) intervals above and below the Toba cryptotephra position, with no stratigraphic breaks. For samples synchronous or proximal to the Toba interval, we found no change in low elevation tree cover, or in cool climate C-3 and warm season C-4 xerophytic and mesophytic grass abundance that is outside of normal variability. A spike in locally derived charcoal and xerophytic C-4 grasses immediately after the Toba eruption indicates reduced precipitation and die-off of at least some afromontane vegetation, but does not signal volcanic winter conditions. A review of Toba tuff petrological and melt inclusion studies suggest a Tambora-like 50 to 100 Mt SO2 atmospheric injection. However, most Toba climate models use SO2 values that are one to two orders of magnitude higher, thereby significantly overestimating the amount of cooling. A review of recent genetic studies finds no support for a genetic bottleneck at or near similar to 74 ka. Based on these previous studies and our new paleoenvironmental data, we find no support for the Toba catastrophe hypothesis and conclude that the Toba supereruption did not 1) produce a 6-year-long volcanic winter in eastern Africa, 2) cause a genetic bottleneck among African AMH populations, or 3) bring humanity to the brink of extinction.

J	HAVENS, KE				HAVENS, KE			SEASONAL AND SPATIAL VARIATION IN NUTRIENT LIMITATION IN A SHALLOW SUBTROPICAL LAKE (LAKE OKEECHOBEE, FLORIDA) AS EVIDENCED BY TROPHIC STATE INDEX DEVIATIONS	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Historical data (1980-1992) from Lake Okeechobee, Florida were used to construct trophic state indices (TSIs). Deviations among chlorophyll-a, phosphorus, nitrogen and transparency-based TSIs were used to quantify seasonal variation in nutrient limitation and seston composition at four sites in the lake. The results indicated that nitrogen was the nutrient most often limiting to algal production. However, at stations in the South and West, phosphorus limitation was sometimes found. The TSI deviations also indicated a seasonal cycle of nitrogen limitation and seston composition at all sampling sites. During winter, non-algal particles dominated light attenuation, and nutrients tended not to be limiting. During mid-summer, there was a greater contribution of algae to light attenuation, and nutrient limitation was most pronounced. Nutrient limitation was more frequent at the South and West stations than at the North and East stations. At the latter, light limitation was nearly always indicated, and non-algal particles always dominated light attenuation. The results are in close agreement with those recently obtained from nutrient bioassays in Lake Okeechobee, and they confirm the great seasonal and spatial heterogeneity of algal production limitation in this large subtropical lake.																			0003-9136					JUL	1994	131	1					39	53																WOS:A1994NZ83800003

In Lake Vaeng C, vicinus was absent during summer, whereas in Lake Sobygard it continued producing distinct cohorts throughout summer. A comparison between the lakes showed that in the lake where C. vicinus was absent during summer, food limitation generally existed. In contrast, abundance of C. vicinus during summer in Lake Sobygard always coincided with available resources sufficient for the whole lifecycle. Thus, summer diapause of C. vicinus is suggested to be a strategy to avoid food limitation. Avoidance of fish predation does not seem substantially to influence life cycles.																			0018-8158					MAR 1	1996	320	1-3					223	227		10.1007/BF00016823	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016823													WOS:A1996UE14900025

Epidemiological surveys indicated that 37% of fish farms were affected in 2015 with an average mortality rate of 9.2% and a potential economic impact of around US$ 100 million. Despite a number of researchers and organizations investigating potential causes results so far have been inconclusive. Meanwhile recent reports emerged of the presence of a new orthomyxovirus, Tilapia Lake Virus (TiLV) in Israel, which shares a border and migrating avifauna with Egypt. Tissue samples from seven farms affected by 'summer mortality' were tested at the University of Stirling for TiLV. Samples from three of seven farms tested positive using PCR; the first time that TiLV has been identified in Egypt. Sequence analysis yielded a TiLV sequence with 93% homology to the published TiLV sequence described from Israel. More research is required to determine if TiLV is linked to 'summer mortality'.

J	Verleyen, E; Hodgson, DA; Sabbe, K; Vyverman, W				Verleyen, E; Hodgson, DA; Sabbe, K; Vyverman, W			Late Quaternary deglaciation and climate history of the Larsemann Hills (East Antarctica)	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												The Late Quaternary climate history of the Larsemann Hills has been reconstructed using siliceous microfossils (diatoms, chrysophytes and silicoflagellates) in sediment cores extracted from three isolation lakes. Results show that the western peninsula, Stornes, and offshore islands were ice-covered between 30 000 yr BP and 13 500 cal. yr BP. From 13 500 cal. yr BP (shortly after the Antarctic Cold Reversal) the coastal lakes of the Larsemann Hills were deglaciated and biogenic sedimentation commenced. Between 13 500 and 11 500 cal. yr BP conditions were warmer and wetter than during the preceding glacial period, but still colder than today. From 11 500 to 9500 cal. yr BP there is evidence for wet and warm conditions, which probably is related to the early Holocene climate optimum, recorded in Antarctic ice cores. Between 9500 and 7400 cal. yr BP dry and cold conditions are inferred from high lake-water salinities, and low water levels and an extended duration of nearshore sea-ice. A second climate optimum occurred between 7400 and 5230 cal. yr BP when stratified, open water conditions during spring and summer characterised the marine coast of Prydz Bay. From 5230 until 2750 cal. yr BP sea-ice duration in Prydz Bay increased, with conditions similar to the present day. A short return to stratified, open water conditions and a reduction in nearshore winter sea-ice extent is evident between 2750 and 2200 cal. yr BP. Simultaneously, reconstructions of lake water depth and salinity suggests relatively humid and warm conditions on land between 3000 and 2000 cal. yr BP, which corresponds to a Holocene Hypsithermal reported elsewhere in Antarctica. Finally, dry conditions are recorded around 2000, between 760 and 690, and between 280 and 140 cal. yr BP. These data are consistent with ice-core records from Antarctica and support the hypothesis that lacustrine and marine sediments on land can be used to evaluate the effect of long-term climate change on the terrestrial environment.

The application of a quantitative protargol stain (QPS) resulted in accurate data on ciliate species composition, as well as reliable abundance and biomass numbers. The main ciliate groups throughout the investigated period were identified as oligotrichs, prostomatids and small hymenostomes, thus composing the so-called Oligotrichetea a ubiquitous and typical ciliate community found also in many other comparable beta-to alpha-mesosaprobic pelagic environments. Significant seasonal variations in ciliate abundance and biomass occurred, revealing lowest numbers during autumn and winter. Despite the overall species composition being relatively unaltered during the investigated years, absolute ciliate numbers and biomasses were high at the beginning of the investigated period during the years of chemical RIPLOX-treatment and decreased by more than 50% in the last 2 years of the study. This decrease of ciliate numbers and biomass parallels thus the significant decrease of nutrients in the water body as a result of phosphorus precipitation in 1995 and 1996, followed by several restoration measures carried out during the years 1998-1999. Thus, lowest ciliate abundance and biomass occurred in the last year of restoration and slightly increased again with the re-colonization of macrophytes the year after.

However, the distribution and concentration of n-alkanes are controlled by multiple factors, and their interpretation across northern China has revealed obvious discrepancies. It is therefore important to investigate the controlling factors of n-alkane proxies before using them for paleoclimate reconstruction. In this study, we collected fresh plant leaves, basin surface soils, lake surface sediments, and a short sediment core (DH20B) in the Daihai Lake basin to analyze the paleoclimate implications of n-alkanes. Our results show that long-chain (C-27-C-35) n-alkanes in Daihai Lake are dominated by allochthonous sources. The average chain length of long-chain n-alkanes (ACL(27-35)) and total long-chain n-alkane concentration ( n-ary sumation alk(long-chain)) of DH20B are significantly correlated with regional summer temperature (r = 0.54, p < 0.01) and summer precipitation (r = 0.41, p < 0.05) over the past 60 years. These results indicate that ACL(27-35) and n-ary sumation alk(long-chain) from Daihai Lake sediments have the potential to reconstruct past summer temperature and summer precipitation, respectively, because higher summer temperature promotes the synthesis of longer-chain n-alkanes to reduce water loss (leading to higher ACL(27-35)) and increased summer precipitation promotes plant growth (leading to higher n-ary sumation alk(long-chain)). Moreover, we found that human activity significantly affected n-ary sumation alk(long-chain) through cultivation and grazing after 2005. Our findings may have broad significance for paleoclimate reconstruction of other hydrologically closed lakes, highlighting the importance of proxy validation studies.

Radiocarbon assays revealed that 41 of 55 canoes studied were from the Late Archaic period, dating between 2300 and 5000 B.P Analysis of canoe form and comparison to the small number of other known Florida Archaic period canoes correct previous ideas about early canoes. Patterns of wood choice and manufacturing techniques known from younger canoes were in place during the Late Archaic. The Archaic period canoes from Newnans Lake are indistinguishable from canoes produced in later periods and are not the crude, short, blunt-ended type thought to represent the earliest dugout canoes. Thwarts or low partitions on almost half of the Archaic canoes studied confirm a long temporal span to the canoe-making tradition of peninsular Florida. Middle and Late Archaic groups had boat-building and related technologies in place 7,000 years ago and were expanding into areas with newly emerging freshwater resources created by higher water tables.																			0002-7316					JUL	2003	68	3					533	551		10.2307/3557107	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3557107													WOS:000184246600007

Deciphering landscape preferences: Investigating the roles of familiarity and biome types	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Although people generally have positive evaluations of natural environments and stimuli, theory and research suggest that certain biomes are more preferable than others. Existing theories often draw on evolutionary ideas and people's familiarity with biome types, with familiarity being the most supported, albeit not conclusively, in existing research. Across three samples (n = 720) we sought to compare preference ratings of 40 images that represented ten biomes (beach, lake, tropical and temperate forest, marsh, swamp, meadow, park, mountain, and river). We addressed objective familiarity by recruiting samples from two distinct geographies (Florida and Ontario), and we assessed subjective familiarity via image ratings. Familiarity was positively associated with liking biomes, though this trend was stronger for subjective familiarity compared to geography. Substantial variation in biome type preferences could not be attributed to familiarity. Specific biome types were strongly preferred irrespective of familiarity and geography. e.g., beaches and lakes were highly preferred, while marshes and swamps were substantially less preferred than other biome types. Further analyses found that the individual difference of nature relatedness predicted both familiarity and liking of all biomes except beaches, and that there was a lack of seasonal effects (fall and winter) across two Ontario samples. We discuss how results provide qualified support for the familiarity view, limits of this interpretation, how methodological choices such as the number of ratings might impact findings, and the potential applications of these results in landscape design.																			0169-2046	1872-6062				OCT	2021	214								104189	10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.104189	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.104189													WOS:000678114700002

Terrestrial smokers: Thermal springs due to hydrothermal convection of groundwater connected to surface water	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Thermal springs are ubiquitous features whose underground kinematic structure is mostly unknown but are typically thought to originate from deep sources. We documented a type of thermal springs at the banks of a volcanic lake that are discharge zones of hydrothermal convection cells circulating groundwater within the near shore environment. The convection captures lake water through the lakebed, mixes it with deeper groundwater at velocities of 100s of m d(-1), then returns the water to the lake via the spring. The convection cell is flushed in a few hours and turns over the lake's volume in a few days. Most volcanic lakes and other relatively cool surface water bodies in areas of elevated geothermal heat fluxes meet the conditions for the occurrence of local hydrothermal circulation of groundwater. The type of spring we studied, the terrestrial version of black smokers, is likely present but perhaps unrecognized at many areas. Citation: Bayani Cardenas, M., A. M. F. Lagmay, B. J. Andrews, R. S.

LONG-DISTANCE CAVERNOUS FLOW IN THE UPPER FLORIDA AQUIFER, WOODVILLE MANTLED-KARST PLAIN, LEON AND WAKULLA COUNTIES, FLORIDA	JOURNAL OF CAVE AND KARST STUDIES												A Rhodamine WT dye study was conducted to establish whether a subterranean flow could be positively demonstrated between Lake Jackson, a shallow perched lake, and Wakulla Spring, a renowned first magnitude spring. The lake is 30.6 km north of the Spring and 8 km north of Tallahassee, Florida. Dye was injected into a lake-bottom sinkhole on September 19, 2017, for 6.5 min. The main distinctive dye concentration peaks were recorded by sondes located at both Wakulla Spring and nearby Sally Ward Spring after 35 days. Charcoal packs deployed at these two springs and three others nearby also encountered dye within time intervals consistent with the recorded breakthrough events measured by the sondes, all of which were of short duration ranging from 1 min to 100 min. These results indicate that some of the injected dye made its way to several Wakulla County springs via an aquifer conduit-like system dominated by advection within which water flowed at an average speed of 0.8 km d-1. Dye detection at five well-separated springs further indicates that the conduit system is both braided and branching. Although these results show a connection between Lake Jackson and several Wakulla County springs and point to a leaky-conduit flow able to transport nutrients and pollutants rapidly over long distances, another important conclusion of the study is that, overall, very little of the dye injected into the lake-bottom sinkhole made it to Wakulla Spring. This indicates that most of the dye dispersed into the limestone matrix. This study has been exploratory in design and only allows conjectural statements on the actual dye-mass balance.																			1090-6924	2331-3714				DEC	2024	86	3-4								10.4311/2022ES0114	http://dx.doi.org/10.4311/2022ES0114													WOS:001422230600003

John			Mid to late Holocene Indian monsoon variability, aridification and civilization changes in the Deccan Plateau, India	MARINE GEOLOGY												Climate change has been a key driver throughout human history and has frequently been associated with the rise and fall of civilizations. Holocene settlement changes or population displacements were almost always preceded by changes in climate. A high-resolution sedimentary record from the western Bay of Bengal offers insights to centennial-scale mid- to late-Holocene Indian summer monsoon (ISM) variability and its role in the decline of chalcolithic human settlements on India's Deccan Plateau. Increased erosion in the Indian peninsula during the mid- to late-Holocene, due to aridification and agricultural expansion, is evidenced by higher sedimentation, more magnetic mineral content, coarser magnetic grain size, and increased sand content. The results from mineral magnetic and textural analyses reveal centennial-scale abrupt weak ISM during the Bond events in the core monsoon zone of India. The Deccan Chalcolithic civilizations flourished between similar to 4.0-3.0 ka BP owing to the favorable climatic conditions, but most of the settlements were deserted after similar to 3.0 ka BP. We argue that the abrupt weakening of ISM during Bond event 2 (similar to 3.1-2.8 ka BP) caused this collapse of Deccan Chalcolithic. The results from this study together with the published records of number of settlements and summed radiocarbon dates suggest a climate-culture link in the Deccan Plateau. The weak ISM periods in this study are coherent with the records of total solar irradiance and the percentage of hematite-stained grains from the North Atlantic and suggest solar control on these abrupt climatic events.																			0025-3227	1872-6151				NOV	2024	477								107412	10.1016/j.margeo.2024.107412	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.margeo.2024.107412		OCT 2024											WOS:001340469700001

The mean lengths +/- SD of the three species were 118 +/- 20 mm (n = 872), 112 +/- 14 mm (n = 109), and 66 +/- 8 mm (n = 70), respectively. Epibenthic gillnet catches of all three species were much higher at night (21.00-05.00 GMT) than during the day (09.00-17.00 GMT). In general, there was segregation by depth zone between these three species, which were caught at night at mean depths of 17.3 +/- 6.2 m, 7.9 +/- 3.3 m, 13.6 +/- 5.0 m, respectively. During the hours of darkness in spring and late summer, Alpine bullhead were more likely to be associated with the bottom than Arctic charr and brown trout. Artic charr fed almost exclusively on zooplankton, while brown trout and Alpine bullhead fed largely on insect larvae and Eurycercus lamellatus. Although selective differences are partly responsible for resource partitioning between the two salmonid species and Alpine bullhead, interactive segregation may also occur.																			1239-6095					APR 29	2011	16	2					149	157																WOS:000290192500007

In the piedmont of South Carolina, during extreme drought conditions in August 2008, I. rufipes was found on redroot flatsedge, C. erythrorhizos, which had colonized mudflats on exposed shorelines of Hartwell Lake in Clemson. Surveys to determine the host-plant range of I. rufipes were conducted from 2008 to 2012 in the Blue Ridge ecoregion of Georgia and North Carolina and coastal plain and piedmont of Georgia and South Carolina. The blissid exploits the short (floriferous) growth form of C. erythrorhizos, an annual sedge of unpredictable availability in ephemeral mudflats, while maintaining populations mainly on a perennial sedge, Scirpus cyperinus, in more persistent habitats. The blissid also develops on the generally taller C. erythrorhizos plants in more permanent wetlands. Only one generation of I. rufipes might be possible on annual sedges of inconstant occurrence, but the blissid is bivoltine on woolly sedge (woolgrass), S. cyperinus. Adults overwintered not only on host sedges (mainly S. cyperinus), but also on nonhost sedges and other graminoids, beginning as early as September. A mating pair was observed on S. cyperinus in mid-May, early instars in late May, and first-generation adults by mid-July. Early instars of a second generation (and a mating pair) were observed in mid-August. The late instars found sparingly on woolly sedge in late fall and early winter probably attain adulthood or die during winter; only adults were observed after January. New state records for I. rufipes are Arkansas, Oklahoma, and South Carolina.																			0013-8797					OCT	2013	115	4					295	310		10.4289/0013-8797.115.4.295	http://dx.doi.org/10.4289/0013-8797.115.4.295													WOS:000326904300001

The background level of Se in lake waters (n = 41) was 58.4 ng l-1 (28.7-115 ng l-1) and the seasonal variation was small. The mean water Se concentration of lakes surrounded by fields was significantly higher than that of forest lakes in late summer, but not in spring. The fraction of Se in humic substances constituted 52% of the dissolved Se in lake water, whereas selenite and selenate made up 8-9% each. Particulate Se in lake waters was about 10% of the total water Se concentration. The vertical distribution of Se in lake water was related to the growth of algae. Se accumulated in perch muscle tissue. The Se concentration of lake sediments has increased from the last century to the 1990s mainly because of agricultural activity and atmospheric fallout. The accumulation of Se in perch and the Se concentration in sediments were strongly related to the trophic state of the lakes. No clear evidence was found that Se fertilization has significantly increased Se sedimentation in lakes.																			0167-8809					JUN	1995	54	1-2					137	148		10.1016/0167-8809(94)00574-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0167-8809(94)00574-X													WOS:A1995RE37100013

When temperature decreased, the ratio between the colony-associated bacteria and the Microcystis gradually decreased as estimated by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)-based approach. Diversity of bacterial communities was determined through denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA gene fragments. Cluster analysis of the DGGE profiles showed that most of the bacterial communities associated with Microcystis colonies collected on the nearby dates were clustered together. The bacterial clones from four clone libraries in different months were classified into 5, 12, 6 and 12 operational taxonomic units, most of which were affiliated with Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Shift in dominance from pathogenic Aeromonas sp. to Shewanella sp. capable of remineralization of many organic materials was observed, and both species seemed to be associated with Microcystis colonies along with the bloom decline. These results indicated that the potential harmful effects of the Microcystis bloom on the safety of lake water during the decline period should be taken into account.					yu, yang/HIZ-9682-2022														0003-4088	2100-000X					2011	47	4					355	362		10.1051/limn/2011047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2011047													WOS:000301281600005

Risk factors associated with the carriage of Ixodes scapularis relative to other tick species in a population of pet dogs from southeastern Ontario, Canada	TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES												In eastern North America, the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, is the vector for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the causal agents for human and canine Lyme disease and anaplasmosis, respectively. The extensive range expansion of I. scapularis in Ontario is a growing veterinary and public health concern. However, there is limited information on the risk factors associated with I. scapularis carriage on dogs. Within an emerging area for Lyme disease risk in southeastern Ontario, we identified the tick species carried by dogs; determined the prevalence of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum in I. scapularis; and examined associations between pet demographics, travel history, and geographical location and the odds of: a dog carrying I. scapularis relative to other tick species (i.e., case-case design), and a removed I. scapularis being infected with B. burgdorferi. Seven species of ticks were collected from 543 companion dogs at 20 participating veterinary hospitals from April to December 2015. Ixodes scapularis were detected on 85.6% of parasitized dogs, and 7.5% of these dogs were carrying at least one B. burgdorferi-positive tick. Based on a multivariable logistic regression model, the odds of I. scapularis infestation relative to other tick species was significantly higher in fall and spring compared to summer, with closer proximity to Lake Ontario, in female compared to male dogs, in dogs weighing over 30 kg compared to lighter dogs, and in dogs that had not visited a farm in the 7 days prior to tick removal. Based on univariable exact logistic regression models, the odds of B. burgdorferi-positive I. scapularis carriage relative to B. burgdorferi-negative I. scapularis were significantly higher for dogs that traveled in the 14 days prior to tick removal, for those dogs under 1 year of age, and for those weighing less than 10 kg. This case-case study provides information for veterinarians and public health practitioners to help protect dogs and their owners from Lyme disease in southeastern Ontario.

General circulation of Lake Superior: Mean, variability, and trends from 1979 to 2006	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Previous observations and modeling studies of Lake Superior have only partly elucidated its large-scale circulation, in terms of both the climatological state and interannual variability. We use an eddy resolving, three-dimensional hydrodynamic model to bridge this gap. We simulate Lake Superior circulation and thermal structure from 1979 to 2006 and consider the mechanisms responsible for the flow. Model results are compared to available direct observations of temperature and currents. Circulation in the lake is primarily cyclonic during all seasons, and a two-gyre structure is sometimes present. Surface circulation patterns in winter mimic wind directions but become organized in summer by the presence of thermal gradients. On the annual mean, nearshore currents are controlled by thermal gradients, while offshore flow is primarily determined by the wind. From a uniform bathymetry simulation, we determine that topographic variations cause small-scale structures in the open lake flow and are critical to the development of nearshore-offshore temperature gradients. The lake exhibits significant variability in current speed and direction on synoptic time scales, but coherent patterns of interannual variability are not found. Long-term trends due to changing meteorological forcing are found. Model results suggest the increase in lake surface temperature (0.37 degrees C/decade) is significantly correlated to increases in wind speed above the lake (0.18 m/s/decade), increased current speeds (0.37 cm/s/decade), and declining ice coverage (-886 km(2)/yr).

J	Savage, KS; Bird, DK; Ashley, RP				Savage, KS; Bird, DK; Ashley, RP			Legacy of the California Gold Rush: Environmental geochemistry of arsenic in the southern Mother Lode Gold District	INTERNATIONAL GEOLOGY REVIEW												Gold mining activity in the Sierra Nevada foothills, both recently and during the California Gold Rush, has exposed arsenic-rich pyritic rocks to weathering and erosion. This study describes arsenic concentration and speciation in three hydrogeologic settings in the southern Mother Lode Gold District: mineralized outcrops and mine waste rock (overburden); mill tailings submerged in a water reservoir; and lake waters in this monomietic reservoir and in a monomietic lake developing within a recent open-pit mine. These environments are characterized by distinct modes of rock-water interaction that influence the local transport and fate of arsenic. Arsenic in outcrops and waste rock occurs in arsenian pyrite containing an average of 2 wt% arsenic. Arsenic is concentrated up to 1300 ppm in fine-grained, friable, iron-rich weathering products of the arsenian pyrite (goethite, jarosite, copiapite), which develop as efflorescences and crusts on weathering outcrops. Arsenic is sorbed as a bidentate complex on geothite, and substitutes for sulfate in jarosite. Submerged mill tailings obtained by gravity core at Don Pedro Reservoir contain arsenic up to 300 ppm in coarse sand layers. Overlying surface muds have less arsenic in the solid fraction but higher concentrations in porewaters (up to 500 mu g/L) than the sands. Fine quartz tailings also contain up to 3.5 ppm mercury related to the ore processing. The pH values in sediment porewaters range from 3.7 in buried gypsum-bearing sands and tailings to 7 in the overyling lake sediments. Reservoir waters immediately above the cores contain up to 3.5 mu g/L arsenic; lake waters away from the submerged tailings typically contain less than 1 mu g/L arsenic. Dewatering during excavation of the Harvard open-pit mine produced a hydrologic cone of depression that has been recovering toward the pre-mining groundwater configuration since mining ended in 1994. Aqueous arsenic concentrations in the 80 m deep pit lake are up to 1000 mu g/L. Redistribution of the arsenic occurs during summer stratification, with highest concentrations at middle depths. The total mass of arsenic in the pit lake increases coinciding with early winter rains that erode, partially dissolve, and transport arsenic-bearing salts into the pit lake. Arsenic concentration, speciation, and distribution in the Sierra Nevada foothills depend on many factors, including the lithologic sources of arsenic, climatic influences on weathering of host minerals, and geochemical characteristics of waters with which source and secondary minerals react. Oxidation of arsenian pyrite to geothite, jarosite, and copiapite causes temporary attenuation of arsenic during summer, when these secondary minerals accumulate; subsequent rapid dissemination of arsenic during summer, when these secondary minerals accumulate; subsequent rapid dissemination of arsenic into the aqueous environment is caused by annual winter storms. As the population of the Mother Lode area grows, it is increasingly important to consider these effects during planning and development of land and groundwater resources.																			0020-6814					MAY	2000	42	5					385	415		10.1080/00206810009465089	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00206810009465089													WOS:000087124200001
J	Squires, MM; Lesack, LFW				Squires, MM; Lesack, LFW			Spatial and temporal patterns of light attenuation among lakes of the Mackenzie Delta	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The seasonal dynamics of light attenuation, and the relative roles of total suspended solids (TSS), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chlorophyll as light attenuators among two sets of lakes in the Mackenzie Delta, were assessed during the open-water periods of 1998 and 1999. 2. The first set consisted of 40 spatially discrete lakes where the frequency of flooding with river water was controlled by sill height ('sill-set lakes'). The second set consisted of a chain of six lakes connected to a main river channel ( frequently flooded, all with same frequency), but where riverine influence was controlled by the distance from the channel connection point ('chain-set lakes'). 3. As the flooding frequency of lakes decreased (sill-set), and as the distance from the channel connection point increased (chain-set), lake water became increasingly transparent and the stability ( decreasing temporal variability) of underwater light increased. 4. The effect of flooding on transparency was greater in years with a high minimum summer water level. However, the effect of river flooding on lake water transparency was damped more by an increase in the frequency and duration of flooding than by an increase in distance from the channel connection point. 5. The index of scattering was linearly related to TSS over the common range of concentrations in both sets of lakes. The specific attenuation coefficient for TSS ( and scattering) increased substantially from the most turbid to the most transparent waters. 6. During the summer, DOC provided an approximate index of water colour in the sill-set lakes but not in the chain-set lakes, where the gradient of DOC ran counter to the gradient of water colour. The specific attenuation coefficient for water colour was roughly constant among both sets of lakes. 7. Calculations of partial attenuation show that, during the spring flood peak, TSS is the dominant attenuator among most lakes, other than those with high sills or positioned far from channel connection points. During the lengthy summer period of open water, however, water colour appeared to be the most important light attenuator among almost all of the lakes in the central delta, with chlorophyll a of only minor importance. 8. Lakes of the Mackenzie Delta may be quite sensitive to changes in climate and ultraviolet-b (UV-b) radiation in the circumpolar arctic because of the role of DOC as an attenuator of photosynthetically active radiation and UV-b irradiance and as an energy source for microbial foodwebs in this system.																			0046-5070					JAN	2003	48	1					1	20		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.00960.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.00960.x													WOS:000179693900001

Whole-lake experiments were conducted in two hardwater lakes (Half-moon and Figure Eight) in Alberta, Canada, to investigate the effectiveness of repeated lime (slaked lime: Ca(OH)(2) and/or calcite: CaCO3) treatments (5-78 mg L-1) for up to 7 years. 2. Randomized intervention analysis of intersystem differences between the experimental and three reference lakes demonstrated a decline in euphotic total phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentrations in the experimental lakes after repeated lime treatments. 3. After the second lime application to Halfmoon Lake, mean winter total phosphorus release rates (TPRR) decreased to < 1 Mg m(-2) day(-1) compared with 3.6 mg m(-2) day(-1) during the winter after initial treatment. In the final year of lime application, mean summer TPRR decreased to 4.5 mg m(-2) day(-1) compared with 7.6 mg m(-2) day(-1) in the pretreatment year. 4. Mean macrophyte biomass declined and species composition was altered at 1 and 2 m depths in Figure Eight Lake during lime application. Over the first 6 years of treatment, macrophyte biomass at 2 m declined by 95% compared with concentrations recorded during the initial treatment year. In the last year of the study, macrophyte biomass at 2 m reached initial treatment concentrations, which coincided with the greatest water transparency. Over the treatment period, macrophyte species shifted from floating to rooted plants. 5. Multiple lime applications can improve water quality in eutrophic hardwater lakes for periods of up to 7 years.					; Ghadouani, Anas/A-2568-2008	Murphy, Thomas/0000-0002-5427-1290; Ghadouani, Anas/0000-0002-1252-4851													0046-5070					AUG	2001	46	8					1089	1103		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00792.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00792.x													WOS:000170565800007
J	Moiseenko, TI				Moiseenko, TI			The fate of metals in Arctic surface waters. Method for defining critical levels	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Based upon studies in the industrially developed Arctic region, Russian Kola, here we discuss the fate of metals in high latitude surface water. Mainly, attention is paid to the priority pollutants from copper-nickel smelters. The influence of accompanying processes, such as acidification and eutrophication, on metal behavior is considered. The dramatic situation for fauna of Arctic latitudes is illustrated: (i) during the snow-melt, due to the pulse of ionic metal forms; and (ii) during the long polar winter in lower water layers, due to the involvement of a wide spectrum of metals in the redox-cycle under eutrophication and oxygen deficiency. Here we identify fish pathologies, which are related to the influence of metals. Generalizing the data on metal behavior, an original approach to define the integrated impact dose of metals - a toxicity index - has been developed. It presents a visualization of the integrated toxicity index for surface waters of the Russian Kola (based on the data for a 460-lake survey). As shown, there is a risk of fish diseases, due to both airborne contamination by metals and an indirect leaching by acid runoff over almost 30% of the area of the Russian Kola. For the Arctic region, polar winter stress syndrome will be repeatedly significant. During the polar night, as well as the spring, the vulnerability of the Arctic biota to toxic impact is higher. The accompaniment of water metal-pollution by two or more stressors would occur simultaneously, thereby multiplying the risk that it could develop. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

In gas vacuolated O. redekei low light intensity induced an increase in trichome width, cell length, and size of gas vacuoles; these trichomes were buoyant and accumulated at the surface of suspensions. The distinct light-dependent variation in sizes of gas vacuoles was used as an additional feature for the delimitation of O. redekei and O. amphigranulata. The different trichome types of O. redekei found under experimental conditions were also observed in natural samples; they were abundant in summer and in winter plankton and in the epi- and metalimnion of the stratified lakes. A species resembling O. redekei and characterized by large central and polar gas vacuoles occurred in the metalimnion of Plussee, especially during epilimnetic water blooms of O. redekei.																			0003-9136						1982	95	OCT					235	248																WOS:A1982PV20900018

In this study, measurements of energy flux and water vapor were performed over a lake in the Badain Jaran Desert, China from March 2012 to March 2013. The studied lake had about a 2-month frozen period (December and January) and a 10-month open-water period (February-November). Latent heat flux (LE) and sensible heat flux (Hs) acquired using the eddy covariance technique were argued by measurements of longwave and shortwave radiation. Both fluxes of longwave and shortwave radiation showed seasonal dynamics and daily fluctuations during the study period. The reflected solar radiation was much higher in winter than in other seasons. LE exhibited diurnal and seasonal variations. On a daily scale, LE was low in the morning and peaked in the afternoon. From spring (April) to winter (January), the diurnal amplitude of LE decreased slowly. LE was the dominant heat flux throughout the year and consumed most of the energy from the lake. Generally speaking, LE was mostly affected by changes in the ambient wind speed, while Hs was primarily affected by the product of water-air temperature difference and wind speed. The diurnal LE and Hs were negatively correlated in the open-water period. The variations in Hs and LE over the lake were differed from those on the nearby land surface. The mean evaporation rate on the lake was about 4.0 mm/d over the entire year, and the cumulative annual evaporation rate was 1445 mm/a. The cumulative annual evaporation was 10 times larger than the cumulative annual precipitation. Furthermore, the average evaporation rates over the frozen period and open-water period were approximately 0.6 and 5.0 mm/d, respectively. These results can be used to analyze the water balance and quantify the source of lake water in the Badain Jaran Desert.

Nutrient losses from land to surface waters were assessed using statistical models incorporating the effect of changed hydrology. Climate-change was predicted by the ECHAM4/OPYC General Circulation Model (IPCC A2 scenario) dynamically downscaled by the Danish HIRHAM regional climate model (25 km grid) for two time slices: 1961-1990 (control) and 2071-2100 (scenario). HIRHAM predicts an increase in mean annual precipitation of 47mm (5%) and an increase in mean annual air temperature of 3.2 degrees C (43%). The HIRHAM predictions were used as external forcings to the rainfall-runoff model NAM, which was set: up and ran for 6 subcatchments within and for the entire, Gjern river basin. Mean annual runoff from the river basin increases 27mm (7.5%, p < 0.05) when comparing the scenario to the control. Larger changes, however, were found regarding the extremes; runoff during the wettest year in the 30-year period increased by 58mm (12.3%). The seasonal pattern is expected to change with significantly higher runoff during winter. Summer runoff is expected to increase in predominantly groundwater fed streams and decrease in streams with a low base-flow index. The modelled change in the seasonal hydrological pattern is most pronounced in first- or second-order streams draining loamy catchments, which currently have a low base-flow during the summer period. Reductions of 40-70% in summer runoff are predicted for this stream type. A statistical nutrient loss model was developed for simulating the impact of changed hydrology on diffuse nutrient losses (i.e. losses from land to surface waters) and applied to the river basin. The simulated mean annual changes in TN loads in a loamy and a sandy subcatchment were, respectively, +2.3 kg N ha(-1) (8.5%) and + 1.6kg N ha(-1) (6.9%). The rainfall-runoff model and the nutrient loss model were chained with Mike I I-TRANS to simulate the combined effects of climate-change on hydrology, nutrient losses and nitrogen retention processes at the scale of the river basin. The mean annual TN export from the river basin increased from the control to the scenario period by 7.7%. Even though an increase in nitrogen retention in the river system of 4.2% was simulated in the scenario period, an increased in-stream TN export resulted because of the simulated increase in the diffuse TN transfer from the land to the surface-waters.

J	SCHERNEWSKI, G; THEESEN, L; KERGER, KE				SCHERNEWSKI, G; THEESEN, L; KERGER, KE			MODELING THERMAL STRATIFICATION AND CALCITE PRECIPITATION OF LAKE BELAU (NORTHERN GERMANY)	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Some aspects of the approach of the Bornhoved Lakes Ecosystem Research Project to modelling Lake Belau are presented. The concept includes a base model which is extended by several submodels to account for special relevant processes in Lake Belau. Two of them and some results are discussed in detail: The model for thermocline dynamics and the model for the carbondioxide equilibrium system together with calcite precipitation. The first includes a submodel for the heat energy balance and especially accounts for the effect of wind mixing by a successive comparison of potential and kinetic energy. The overall agreement with measured values is good, the model is even capable to detect a secondary thermocline. The results underline the sensitivity of the processes within the water body of Lake Belau to wind mixing. The kernel of the inorganic carbon cycle is the calcite equilibrium where the respective system of algebraic equations is solved iteratively. Several adaptions to the hydrochemical conditions of Lake Belau have been made. Calcite precipitation including coprecipitation of phosphate is a mechanism controlling eutrophication of Lake Belau. About 100 kg P are removed from the epilimnion by this process during spring and summer. The amount of 1 kg P/ha removed from the epilimnion underlines the importance of this self-purification process. During summer the carbondioxide concentration in Lake Belau decreases to values of 0.3 . 10(6) M/l so that algae are forced to use HCO3-, which still has a concentration of 0.4 . 10(3) M/l, as a carbon source. Therefore carbon limitation of primary production does not occur.

On the basis of this extensive data set, we investigated the large-scale vertical advective processes responsible for deep-water renewal in Lake Issyk-Kul. At some locations sampled in March, variable peak structures in the tracer profiles were observed that indicate horizontally localized intrusions. These intrusions have their origin in density plumes that propagate along the bottom of the channels in the eastern shelf region. The cold dense water at the bottom of the channels is most likely generated by differential cooling of the water in the shallow shelf regions during winter. During summer, vertical advective processes appear to be limited to the upper 200 m, where upwelling in the open water leads to a doming structure. The August data support the results of earlier investigations that suggested that dynamic forcing by a basinwide gyre is responsible for the upwelling in the open water.					; Finger, David/AFS-6986-2022	Finger, David C./0000-0003-0678-8946; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2003	48	4					1419	1431		10.4319/lo.2003.48.4.1419	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2003.48.4.1419													WOS:000184247900006

Here, we empirically quantified and resolved fluxes of recalcitrant and labile types of leaf litter in temperate riparian forests and streams across a year, representing one of the most emblematic examples of seasonal systems. We quantified intra-annual variation in litter inputs from terrestrial plants to forest floors and streams and estimated aquatic and terrestrial decomposition rates across the year at 6-week intervals. Our data show that the autumn pulse of leaf litter is complemented by smaller magnitude but more constant-through-the-year lateral flows to the stream ecosystems. Decomposition of labile litter fluctuated seasonally, on a different phenology, with generally higher rates in summer, but rates of recalcitrant litter decomposition remained largely constant. Microorganisms were the main contributors to the decomposition process in both forests and streams. Overall, our work highlights the asynchronous and seasonally variable changes in decomposition rates between recalcitrant and labile detritus despite their initial synchronized availability and suggests that the dominating presence of recalcitrant litter buffers ecosystem responses to the concentrated temporal distribution of litter resources.7,8 Investigating such ecological processes both across ecosystem borders and at fine intra-annual resolutions is imperative to understand complex system responses in the context of species' shifts in phenologies and resource quality.9-11					Isabelle, Gounand/ABX-7866-2022														0960-9822	1879-0445				MAY 5	2025	35	9								10.1016/j.cub.2025.03.019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2025.03.019								40203827					WOS:001487147500006

Correlation between regional precipitation and synoptic climate indices like the Southern Annular Mode, paired with a correlation between Ohau catchment precipitation, lake inflow and suspended sediment yield suggest that the Lake Ohau varves are a potentially powerful tool for estimating the amplitude, timing and interdependence of different climate modes operating in the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes over time. A robust chronology and sound climate-proxy model are fundamental requirements for all high-resolution paleoenvironmental records. Here we present a chronology derived from layer counts, and Cs-137 and Pb-210 ages for the top 60 cm of sediments from the distal basin of Lake Ohau that confirm the varved natured of the sedimentary sequence. Sedimentary facies of different varve motifs are used to develop a hydroclimate-proxy model which links stratigraphy to seasonal hydrology. To establish this relationship we use a model accuracy statistic, which shows a quantitative difference between the annual hydrographs associated with each of three primary varve motifs. Distribution of above average inflow events points to summer and autumn hydrologic regimes as the primary control on the deposition of different motifs. This relationship between varve characteristics and hydrology will serve as a tool to reconstruct lake inflow, and by extension precipitation, on an annual basis throughout the late-Holocene for the South Island of New Zealand.

On the Holocene millennial-scale, whether the northwest boundary of the summer monsoon varies according to climate change is a key scientific issue. Yanchi Lake is located in the northern Qilian Mountains and the middle of the Hexi Corridor, where the modern climate is less affected by the Asian summer monsoon. It is a key research area for examining the long-term variations of the Asian summer monsoon. Paleoclimatic data, including AMS C-14 dates of pollen concentrates and bulk organic carbon, lithology, grain-size, mineral composition and geochemical proxies were acquired from sediments of Yanchi Lake. The chronological results show that the lower part of the lacustrine section is formed mainly in the Late Glacial and early Holocene period, while the proxies' data indicate the lake expansion is associated with high content of mineral salts. The middle part of this section is formed during the transitional period of the early and middle Holocene. Affected by the reworking effect, the pollen concentrates AMS 14C dates from the middle part of the section are generally older than those from the lower part. Since the mid-Holocene, Yanchi Lake retreated significantly and the deposition rate dropped obviously. The Yanchi Lake record is consistent with the Late Glacial and Holocene lake records in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the climatic records in typical monsoon domain, which indicate the lake expansion and the strong Asian summer monsoon during the Late Glacial and early Holocene. The long-term monsoonal pattern is different from the lake evolution in Central Asia on the Holocene millennial-scale. This study proves the monsoon impacts on the northwestern margin of the summer monsoon, and also proves the fact that the northern boundary of the summer monsoon moves according to millennial-scale climate change.

Few studies have investigated the association of seasonal variation in bacteria and environmental factors in inland freshwater lake wetlands. Nansi Lake is a large shallow freshwater lake in northern China. It is an important hub of the eastern route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. MethodsIn this study, bacterial 16S rRNA genes were used to analyze the variation of soil bacterial community diversity in Nansi Lake Wetland and its influencing factors in different seasons. ResultsIt is showed that the phylum, family, and genus with the largest relative abundance in the soil of Nansi Lake Wetland are Proteobacteria, Nitrosomonadaceae, and MND1, respectively. There were significant seasonal differences in soil bacterial diversity in Nansi Lake Wetland, which was significantly higher in summer than in winter. Seasonal variation in environmental factors was significantly correlated with the variation in bacterial communities. Temperature and the content of available phosphorus may be the key factors influencing seasonal variation in bacterial diversity. DiscussionThe results of this study further enhance our understanding of the relationship between bacterial community diversity and environmental factors in the lake wetland ecosystem, which can provide scientific data for the conservation of Nansi Lake Wetland.																				1664-302X				JUN 30	2023	14								1169444	10.3389/fmicb.2023.1169444	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1169444								37455734					WOS:001025070200001

Our objective was to examine the effects of larval sea lamprey density on sex ratio, size at metamorphosis, and age at metamorphosis in Lewis Creek, Vermont (one reach with naturally high larval density and one low-density reach), and to determine the effects of lampricide treatments on these characteristics. Lewis Creek has a natural falls that divides the stream into two distinct larval sea lamprey populations; this barrier created areas of high and low densities in the stream before treatment. Lewis Creek was treated with lampricide in 1990 and 1994, and all visible dead sea lampreys were collected, identified, and counted. Sea lamprey transformers (metamorphosing larvae) were measured for length and weight and sex was determined. Larval habitat was quantified above and below the falls in 1999 and 2000, and larval density was quantified by electroshocking below the falls. During the first treatment, larval density above the falls was 64 times greater than density below the falls. Transformers above the falls were similar in weight, were 11% longer, and had a significantly higher proportion of females (75% versus 53%) than those collected below the falls. Density of sea lampreys below the falls increased after treatment. Transformers decreased in average length and weight between 1990 and 1994 and increased in length and weight between 1999 and 2000. The percentage of females fluctuated from 65% after the first treatment (1994) to 44% after the second treatment (1999) to 52% a year later (2000). Overall, higher larval density (below versus above the falls, after versus before treatment) was associated with smaller transformers and lower proportions of females.

J	HOHMAN, WL				HOHMAN, WL			BODY-COMPOSITION OF WINTERING CANVASBACKS IN LOUISIANA - DOMINANCE AND SURVIVAL IMPLICATIONS	CONDOR												I studied effects of sex, age, and month on body mass and composition of Canvasbacks (Aythya valisineria) at Catahoula Lake (CL) and the Mississippi River Delta (MRD), Louisiana, in winter 1987-1988. Size-adjusted body mass and fat varied by age, month, and site. Fat levels in immatures were greater at MRD than at CL, but changed similarly at both sites. Adults at MRD were also fatter than those at CL in early winter, especially in December, but fat levels of all birds increased from early to late winter and were equivalent by late winter. Body protein adjusted for structural size varied by age, month, and site, and sex, month, and site. Protein levels by site were higher in adults and males than in immatures and females, but sex- and age-related differences averaged < 11 g (5%). Changes in size-adjusted leg muscle protein (index of feeding activity) and body fat were positively associated. This relation (my measure of feeding efficiency) was not affected by sex or age of Canvasbacks, implying that all birds at CL or MRD fed at similar efficiencies by month. At both sites, females were fatter than males; thus, although males were larger and potentially dominant to females, it appears that females were not disadvantaged in their acquisition of nutrients during the year of study. Body mass of CL and MRD birds in winter 1987-1988 was greater than that of Canvasbacks wintering elsewhere. If overwinter and annual survival of Canvasbacks are related to their relative body mass during winter, then survival probabilities of CL and MRD birds may be high compared to other wintering populations.																			0010-5422					MAY	1993	95	2					377	387		10.2307/1369360	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1369360													WOS:A1993LD68800012

Drivers of fatal bird collisions in an urban center	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Millions of nocturnally migrating birds die each year from collisions with built structures, especially brightly illuminated buildings and communication towers. Reducing this source of mortality requires knowledge of important behavioral, meteorological, and anthropogenic factors, yet we lack an understanding of the interacting roles of migration, artificial lighting, and weather conditions in causing fatal bird collisions. Using two decades of collision surveys and concurrent weather and migration measures, we model numbers of collisions occurring at a large urban building in Chicago. We find that the magnitude of nocturnal bird migration, building light output, and wind conditions are the most important predictors of fatal collisions. The greatest mortality occurred when the building was brightly lit during large nocturnal migration events and when winds concentrated birds along the Chicago lakeshore. We estimate that halving lighted window area decreases collision counts by 11x in spring and 6x in fall. Bird mortality could be reduced by ,,60% at this site by decreasing lighted window area to minimum levels historically recorded. Our study provides strong support for a relationship between nocturnal migration magnitude and urban bird mortality, mediated by light pollution and local atmospheric conditions. Although our research focuses on a single site, our findings have global implications for reducing or eliminating a critically important cause of bird mortality.					; Stuber, Erica/ODL-2520-2025; Van Doren, Benjamin/R-7761-2018	Stuber, Erica/0000-0002-2687-6874; Van Doren, Benjamin/0000-0002-7355-6005; Winger, Benjamin/0000-0002-2095-2020; Farnsworth, Andrew/0000-0002-9854-4449; Sivakumar, Ashwin/0000-0001-9628-3751													0027-8424					JUN 15	2021	118	24							e2101666118	10.1073/pnas.2101666118|1of8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2101666118|1of8								34099553					WOS:000664196400003

However, the application of the triple isotopes has lagged because 517O was long considered invariant, too difficult to measure, or redundant to 518O. The spatio-temporal variations of the triple isotope compositions in different water bodies within closed inland lake basins and their indications for hydrological cycle are still poorly documented. This study investigated the water sources, evaporation, and surface water-groundwater interactions in the Daihai Lake basin (a typical closed inland lake basin in northern China), based on the 52H, 518O, 517O, d-excess, and 17O-excess in groundwater, spring water, river water, and lake water during the dry and wet seasons. The stable isotopes in river water and lake water were more enriched, while those in groundwater and spring water were more depleted. The atmospheric precipitation controlled by the westerlies and the East Asian summer monsoon is the main recharge source of the water bodies, but they were affected by evaporation after receiving recharge and showed seasonal variations. Under the influence of hydrogeological conditions, groundwater in the area around Daihai Lake (groundwater discharge area) occurred greater evaporation in the wet season, while the lake water had a large evaporation in the dry season under the effect of climatic conditions. The evaporation to inflow ratio (E/I) of Daihai Lake was 0.68 and 1.53 during the dry season and wet season, respectively, which proves that evaporation dominated the water loss from the lake. Additionally, there are close surface water-groundwater interactions in the study area, especially lacustrine groundwater discharge. This study provides deeper and more comprehensive insights into the application of the triple isotopes in the hydrological cycle, and contributes to improving the understanding of regional hydrological processes and water transport patterns.																			0375-6742	1879-1689				OCT	2025	277								107817	10.1016/j.gexplo.2025.107817	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gexplo.2025.107817		OCT 2025											WOS:001502984800002

DYRESM-CAEDYM was calibrated using field data for a 2-year period and validated against a separate 1-year period. Simulated values for water temperature, dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll a showed good agreement with field measurements. The model tended to underestimate peak values of inorganic nutrients such as ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate, with phosphate levels close to detection limits in both observed and simulated values. The model successfully captured seasonal phytoplankton succession, indicating spring peaks of diatom biomass and summer peaks of cyanophytes. Scenarios in which different reductions in external loading were applied suggest that simultaneous reductions in both external nitrogen and external phosphorus loading is more effective in controlling phytoplankton biomass than reducing input of either nutrient alone. Diatoms responded more strongly to load reductions in phosphorus input than nitrogen load, whereas cyanophytes showed the opposite pattern. A combined 25% reduction in the external loading of both nutrients could significantly decrease phytoplankton biomass in the reservoir below the 7 mu g/L chlorophyll a required by drinking water standards, and the study indicated that DYRESM-CAEDYM can be a useful management tool for eutrophication control.

Both correlation and composite analyses suggest a significant out-of-phase relationship between interdecadal fluctuations of SCMR and the preceding wintertime Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), with negative (positive) PDO epochs favouring above-normal (below-normal) SCMR. The physical mechanism relating the wintertime PDO to the interdecadal variability of SCMR appears to take place via atmospheric and oceanic teleconnections. The below-normal SCMR is characterized by a meridionally arranged vortex (MAV) pattern across the East Asia-western North Pacific (WNP) sector, with an anomalous cyclone, an anomalous anticyclone and an anomalous cyclone occurring alternately over the South China Sea (SCS)-WNP, Yangtze Basin and Lake Baikal in the early summer. This may respond to the PDO-related positive sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies locally over the SCS-WNP and remotely over the tropical eastern Pacific, with the latter forcing anomalous Hadley and Walker circulations. SC is located directly under the divergent moisture environment of anomalous northeasterlies between the anomalous cyclone over the SCS-WNP and the anticyclone over the Yangtze Basin. Again, the below-normal SCMR is preceded by negative (positive) SST anomalies in the midlatitude North Pacific (tropical eastern Pacific) associated with positive PDO in wintertime. Such an anomalous SST pattern subsequently induces a strengthened and northward-shifted upper-tropospheric jet in early summer, leading to significant upper-tropospheric convergence over SC. The out-of-phase relationship between SCMR and wintertime PDO as well as related physical processes are validated by coupled model simulations.

The objectives of this study were to estimate saltcedar mortality to summer wildfire, summer wildfire followed by rollerchopping, and dormant season treatment with 25 percent triclopyr to regrowth following a summer wildfire at Lake Meredith National Recreation Area. In July 1998, more than 100 acres of saltcedar-infested riparian area were burned. In February and March of 1999, regrowth of 200 dormant saltcedar trees were treated with 25 percent triclopyr in JLB oil using the basal bark treatment method. Rollerchopping was conducted in June 1999. Trees that were sprayed had multiple stems and were an average of 4 feet tall. Saltcedar mortality following the summer wildfire was 60.6 percent. Rollerchopping burned areas resulted in 85.1 percent mortality. Saltcedar mortality was 89.9 percent following the February herbicide treatment and 94.5 percent following treatment in March. Preliminary results indicate that dormant season individual plant treatment with 25 percent triclopyr following burning is an effective method for managing saltcedar infestations. However, rollerchopping burned areas may be the most economical in large, alluvial flood plains.																									2000		21					236	237																WOS:000175696900029

The infection levels were modest, with an overall prevalence of 16.1% and an abundance of 0.5 parasites fish(-1). Most of the infected fish (54.1%) had only one parasite attached, whilst only 43% had more than 10. In general, parasite infection increased with increasing age, and hence size of the fish. The increase was modest up to age 7, whereafter a steep increment in parasite burdens occurred. Within each age class there was little effect of either fish size, gender, maturation or choice of macrohabitat upon parasite abundance. There was also little year-to-year variation in infection of the different age classes, indicating a high degree of stability of the parasite-host interactions in this system. The infection levels exhibited seasonal changes, being lowest in early summer and highest during winter. The infection rates seemed to be related to seasonal and ontogenetic habitat shifts of the charr. (C) 1997 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

A total of 209 temperature measurements from 11 years surveillance were used to calculate transport distances until 90% inactivation of the E. coll. Three scenario sets of different site specific values for the first order reference inactivation rate constant k(20) (0.145, 0.230 and 0.555 day(-1)) and temperature coefficient of the rate constant Q(10) (2.07,1.50 and 1.86) were tested in the upper parts of river Indalsalven, in northern Scandinavia. The first and third parameter sets represented respectively pristine water and lake water while the second setting was considered most representative of river Indalsalven. All three scenarios demonstrated considerable transport distances of E. coli with a clear and structured seasonal variation. The longest transport distances observed during late winter and spring are caused by a combination of low water temperature and high water velocity. The results have implications for water management decisions within the watersheds of oligotrophic rivers in cold and temperate climate. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zhou, XL; Shan, BQ; Zhang, H				Zhou, Xiaoling; Shan, Baoqing; Zhang, Hong			Phosphorus release: A biogeochemical insight from a restored lakeside wetland in the Yangtze-Huaihe region, China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												The heavy intensification of agriculture in East China since the 1980s caused the decrease of lake area and water storage capacity with impediment of regulation, lake eutrophication and frequent floods. Many restoration projects have been conducted. However, the knowledge of biogeochemical factors that drive nutrient cycles during the early stage of restoration is still limited. We studied the effect of the remediation of a patch of near-shore shallow wetland on the northern bank of Chaohu Lake in the Yangtze-Huaihe region, China, which was used as rice paddy for many years, on the behavior of phosphorus. Redox potential (ORP), temperature and dissolved oxygen were monitored in situ from May 2006 to November 2007. Samples of soil pore water were collected during this time for the determination of different forms of iron and phosphorus. ORP showed a clear transition of the wetland soil from an oxidized state in winter to a reduced state in summer. The decrease of ORP correlated with the release of large amounts of Fe and P. The maxima of total dissolved Fe and total dissolved P in the summer of the second year were (13.8 +/- 6.8) mg/L and (0.88 +/- 0.27) mg/L, respectively. It is worth noticing that P concentration far exceeded the critical value of lake eutrophication (0.02 mg/L). The pressure of P release to the adjacent lake during the first two years of wetland restoration from rice fields should be taken into account by environmental policy makers.																			1001-0742	1878-7320					2010	22	3					347	354		10.1016/S1001-0742(09)60114-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(09)60114-5								20614775					WOS:000275883400004

In many parts of the world, this enrichment in nitrate (resulting mainly from the leaching and washing out of arable soils and land), as well as in ammonium (very abundant in urban waste emissions) and phosphate (coming from urban wastes and arable soils erosion), has caused a change in the nutrient balance of aquatic environments, called eutrophication. This phenomenon is expressed by a superabundant algal production often followed by a drop in dissolved oxygen levels prejudicial to fauna, and a modification of the algal biodiversity. Eutrophication initially affected lakes with very slow renewal, but then spread to many major rivers, and finally, over the last thirty years, to some large estuaries and bays. The phenomenon of lethal anoxia can occur in summer over vast areas of shallow seas influenced by the inputs of large rivers. The French coasts are generally little affected by the phenomena of massive eutrophication owing to the tidal currents in the English Channel-Atlantic region and the rapidly increasing water depths of the Mediterranean. However, there are some local cases of very disturbed sites, some displaying a proliferation of green macroalgae ("green tides" in Brittany), and others affected by a rapid multiplication of phytoplankton (bays of the Vilaine, Seine and Somme). In fresh water, phosphorus is the main limiting nutrient and the factor controlling plant production (SCHINDLER etal., 1978). In marine environments, by contrast, phosphorus maintains this key role only in the brackish waters of river plumes, and this is only observed in spring: along with silicon, phosphorus can control the intensity of the spring diatom bloom. But summer blooms, in particular those involving dinoflagellates (several of which are toxic) and species generating hypoxia at the bottom in stratified seas, remain controlled by nitrogen, in the same way as the coastal "green tides" caused by green seaweed (Ulva, Enteromorpha, Monostroma, etc.). Mathematical modelling studies of these two types of eutrophication (caused by phytoplankton or macroalgae) help improve our understanding of the respective roles of nitrogen and phosphorus in causing these harmful effects and improve the quality of recommendations for their mitigation. Retrospective simulations of the past thirty years show that, by strongly decreasing the urban and industrial phosphorus emissions, but without decreasing the agricultural nitrogen inputs, we have certainly reduced the spring blooms of diatoms. However, at the same time, we have enhanced the competitiveness of prymnesiophyte nanoflagellates, which are able to grow in waters almost exhausted in phosphorus: this explains the importance of coastal foams of Phaeocystis that affect the shorelines in May from the Baie de Somme to the German Bight.

The present study aims to extract, measure, and classify MP in sediment samples from two seasons (monsoon and summer) in Noyyal River, South India. Microplastic was separated from sediments using the Sediment Microplastic Isolation technique. Microplastics were detected in four forms: foams, films, fragments, and fibres. Dominant polymer types during monsoon are Polystyrene (29%), Polycarbonate (13%), Nylon (13%), and Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (13%). Throughout summer, Polystyrene (17%) was the prevalent polymer type, followed by Nylon (14%), Polycarbonate (11%), and Polyvinyl Chloride (9%). Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) demonstrated that MPs exhibit diverse surface morphologies, including foamy, fibrous, and granular nature. It also shows tearing and fracturing of MPs and aging, indicating substantial summer degradation. Using Polymer Hazard Index (PHI) and Pollution Load Index (PLI), MP vulnerability in sediments indicates that despite lesser PLI, the MPs pose an extreme danger threat to the environment during the summer season compared to the monsoon. The study thus provides insight into the seasonal variation of MPs and their threat in Noyyal River sediments, which will aid in formulating guidelines for the minimization of MPs in river systems.					; Crispin, Augustine/KIA-5176-2024; , purushothaman/ACS-7864-2022	, purushothaman/0000-0001-9439-8408; Crispin, Augustine/0009-0003-6750-0739; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2023	30	43					97712	97722		10.1007/s11356-023-29393-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-29393-w		AUG 2023						37597138					WOS:001051561300014

During the study period (2014-2017), 196 phytoplankton samples were collected from 52 stations by bathometer type Niskin-5L. The samples were prepared for analysis (fixed and concentrated) and analyzed by routine methods. The analysis of the qualitative and quantitative structure of phytoplankton in the monitored areas revealed the existence of 182 phytoplankton species belonging to 14 taxonomic classes. The share of DinophyceaelBacillariophyceae group in the phytoplankton composition was 72.53%. A total of 8 species in the coastal and shelf zones and 7 species in the water of Varna Lake were found in bloom-causing concentrations. The highest quantities of phytoplankton were produced during the winter-spring period, with a trend toward increasing the numbers and phytoplankton biomass from 2014 to 2017. The ecological assessment based on results for the phytoplankton determined the ecological status of coastal and shelf water as "moderate" and the ecological status of Varna Lake water as "bad".

J	Cooke, SJ; Schreer, JF				Cooke, SJ; Schreer, JF			Environmental monitoring using physiological telemetry - A case study examining common carp responses to thermal pollution in a coal-fired generating station effluent	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												During the winters of 1998 and 1999, the response of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) to fluctuating thermal conditions was studied in the Nanticoke Thermal Generating Station discharge canal on Lake Erie. Locomotory activity of fish in the canal was monitored using electromyogram telemetry of the axial musculature. Carp activity was variable but, in general,,they were more active during times of rising and falling temperatures, and were least active during stable periods. The magnitude of water temperature fluctuation was not correlated with activity. Locomotory activity of fish was not generally correlated with absolute water temperature over a wide range of temperatures (similar to2 to 18 degreesC) when examined on an hourly basis, but was moderately correlated at a finer temporal resolution (5 min). During a station shutdown, one carp stayed in the canal and experienced a substantial decrease in temperature yet exhibited no significant change in activity. The results of this study suggest that minor temperature changes (similar to0.1 degreesC per hour) are sufficient to alter activity, probably through fine scale behavioral thermoregulation. The heightened activity resulting from slight changes in temperature may be energetically costly in environments that change as rapidly as thermal effluents. Physiological telemetry permitted us to study the in situ response of fish to dynamic environmental conditions with more precision than is possible using locational telemetry. We suggest that physiological telemetry can provide insights into the behavioral and physiological responses of fish to a diversity of pollutants and represents a robust environmental monitoring technique.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; 													0049-6979	1573-2932					2003	142	1-4					113	136		10.1023/A:1022082003932	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1022082003932													WOS:000181303900008

The relatively constant lake-salinity over the past centuries indicates the lake is in chemical steady state. Springs of the south shore constitute the primary visible input to the lake, so influx and discharge must be via sub-lacustrine ground water. The authors report on the chemistry and stable isotope composition of the springs, deeming them representative of ground-water input. The springs are dominated by Ca, Mg and Na, whereas the lake is dominated by Na. Combining these results with previously published precipitation/rainfall measurements on the lake, the authors calculate the chemical evolution from spring water to lake water, and also calculate a salt balance of the ground-water-lake system. Comparing Cl and delta(18)O compositions in the springs and lake water indicates that 75-80% of the spring water is lost evaporatively during evolution toward lake composition. During evaporation Ca and Mg are lost from the water by carbonate precipitation. Each liter of spring water discharging into the lake precipitates about 18.7 mg of CaCO3. Salt balance calculations indicate that ground water input to the lake is 85.9 x 10(6) m(3)/a and ground water discharge from the lake is 23.0 x 10(6) m(3)/a. Thus, the discharge is about 27% of the input, with the rest balanced by evaporation. A calculation of time to reach steady-state ab initio indicates that the Cl concentration of the present day lake would be reached in about 150 a. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of OPE-related compounds in water samples (n = 90) from the Chaobai River in Beijing, China. Target screening detected 16 traditional OPEs with cumulative concentrations of 0.69-1315 ng/L in spring and 1.5-1218 ng/L in autumn water samples. Suspect and nontarget screening further identified 42 novel OPEs and related compounds, including 12 organophosphate triesters, 11 organophosphate diesters, 7 organophosphonates, 8 organothiophosphate esters, and 4 others. The semiquantified concentrations of these novel compounds make up, on average, 36% of all OPE-related compounds. Thereinto, 36 novel compounds were discovered in surface water for the first time. Downstream samples exhibited more complex OPE profiles and higher concentrations compared to upstream and reservoir samples, associated with varied watershed characteristics. Hazard assessment and risk-based prioritization revealed significant environmental concerns regarding certain chlorinated OPEs and novel compounds, such as bis((5-ethyl-2-methyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinan-5-yl)methyl) methyl phosphonate P,P'-dioxide, 2-ethylhexyl hydrogen (2-ethylhexyl)phosphonate, and dihexyl hydrogen phosphate.

PHOSPHORUS AND NITROGEN LEGACY IN A RESTORATION WETLAND, UPPER KLAMATH LAKE, OREGON	WETLANDS												The effects of sediment, ground-water, and surface-water processes on the timing, quantity, and mechanisms of N and P fluxes were investigated in the Wood River Wetland 5-7 years after agricultural practices ceased and seasonal and permanent wetland hydrologies were restored. Nutrient concentrations in standing water largely reflected ground water in winter, the largest annual water source in the closed-basin wetland. High concentrations of total P (22 mg L-1) and total N (30 mg L-1) accumulated in summer when water temperature, air temperature, and evapotranspiration were highest. High positive benthic fluxes of soluble reactive P and ammonium (NH4+-N) were measured in two sections of the study area in June and August, averaging 46 and 24 mg m(-2) d(-1), respectively. Nonetheless, a wetland mass balance simultaneously indicated a net loss of P and N by assimilation, denitrification (1.1-10.1 mg N m(-2) h(-1)), or solute repartitioning. High nutrient concentrations pose a risk for water quality management. Shifts in the timing and magnitude of water inflows and outflows may improve biogeochemical function and water quality by optimizing seed germination and aquatic plant distribution, which would be especially important if the Wood River Wetland was reconnected with hyper-eutrophic Agency Lake.

The recent disappearance of a persistent Planktothrix bloom: Characterization of a regime shift in the phytoplankton of Sandusky Bay (USA)	HARMFUL ALGAE												Sandusky Bay is the drowned mouth of the Sandusky River in the southwestern portion of Lake Erie. The bay is a popular recreation location and a regional source for drinking water. Like the western basin of Lake Erie, Sandusky Bay is known for being host to summer cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cHABs) year after year, fueled by runoff from the predominantly agricultural watershed and internal loading of legacy nutrients (primarily phosphorus). Since at least 2003, Sandusky Bay has harbored a microcystin-producing bloom of Planktothrix agardhii, a species of filamentous cyanobacteria that thrives in low light conditions. Long-term sampling (2003-2018) of Sandusky Bay revealed regular Planktothrix-dominated blooms during the summer months, but in recent years (2019-2022), 16S rRNA gene community profiling revealed that Planktothrix has largely disappeared. From 2017-2022, microcystin decreased well below the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Spring TN:TP ratios increased in years following dam removal, yet there were no statistically significant shifts in other physicochemical variables, such as water temperature and water clarity. With the exception of the high bloom of Planktothrix in 2018, there was no statistical difference in chlorophyll during all other years. Concurrent with the disappearance of Planktothrix, Cyanobium spp. have become the dominant cyanobacterial group. The appearance of other potential toxigenic genera (i.e., Aphanizomenon, Dolichospermum, Cylindrospermopsis) may motivate monitoring of new toxins of concern in Sandusky Bay. Here, we document the regime shift in the cyanobacterial community and propose evidence supporting the hypothesis that the decline in the Planktothrix bloom was linked to the removal of an upstream dam on the Sandusky River.					; Neudeck, Michelle/AAI-6982-2021; Ward, Christopher/NRY-8845-2025; Bullerjahn, George/F-4428-2010	Brown, Katelyn/0000-0002-8581-9490; Bullerjahn, George/0000-0001-5319-7896; Wagner, Ryan/0000-0002-5197-4230; Heath, Alexis/0009-0002-3969-4938													1568-9883	1878-1470				JUN	2024	136								102656	10.1016/j.hal.2024.102656	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2024.102656		MAY 2024						38876531					WOS:001248209900001

A SAR record of early 21st century change in Greenland	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Glaciers in Greenland are changing rapidly. To better understand these changes, we have produced a series of seven synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter mosaics for seven winters during the period from 2000 to 2013. Six of the mosaics were created using RADARSAT Fine-Beam data and the seventh used ALOS-PALSAR Fine-Beam Single-Polarization data. The RADARSAT mosaics are radiometrically calibrated and capture changes in the backscatter coefficient related to melt and other events, particularly the strong melting in the summer of 2012. Comparison of features in the ascending-orbit ALOS mosaic and the descending-orbit RADARSAT mosaics indicate that in areas of smooth to moderate topography their locations are consistent to within a few tens of meters. The locations of features identifiable in the RADARSAT mosaics, which were collected with the same imaging parameters, generally agree to within better than the 20 m posting of the data. With such geometric accuracy, these data establish a record of change in Greenland for the early part of the 21st century, thus providing a baseline that can be compared with new radar and optical datasets.					; Howat, Ian/A-3474-2008; Scambos, Ted/B-1856-2009; Moon, Twila/AAZ-9302-2021; Joughin, Ian/A-2998-2008	Moon, Twila/0000-0003-0968-7008; SCAMBOS, Ted A./0000-0003-4268-6322; Howat, Ian/0000-0002-8072-6260; Joughin, Ian/0000-0001-6229-679X													0022-1430	1727-5652					2016	62	231					62	71		10.1017/jog.2016.10	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jog.2016.10								31217635					WOS:000376838400007

Here, we report a long-term, high resolution record of summer rainfall extracted from a peat bog in arid eastern-Central Asia (AECA). The record indicates a slowly but steadily increasing trend of summer rainfall in the AECA over the past 8500 years. On this long-term trend are superimposed several abrupt increases in rainfall on millennial timescales that correspond to rapid cooling events in the North Atlantic. During the last millennium, the hydrological climate pattern of the AECA underwent a major change. The rainfall in the past century has reached its highest level over the 8500-year history, highlighting the significant impact of the human-induced greenhouse effect on the hydrological climate in the AECA. Our results demonstrate that even in very dry eastern-Central Asia, the climate can become wetter under global warming.

In this study we present a newly recovered 19.63 m long core from Lake Sidi Ali in the North African Middle Atlas, a transition zone of Atlantic, Western Mediterranean and Saharan air mass trajectories. With a multi-proxy approach based on magnetic susceptibility, carbonate and total organic C content: core-scanning and quantitative XRF, stable isotopes of ostracod shells, charcoal counts, Cedrus pollen abundance, and a first set of diatom data, we reconstruct Western Mediterranean hydro-climatic variability, seasonality and forcing mechanisms during the last 12,000 yr. A robust chronological model based on AMS C-14 dated pollen concentrates supports our high resolution multi-proxy study. Long-term trends reveal low lake levels at the end of the Younger Dryas, during the mid-Holocene interval 6.6 to 5.4 cal ka BP, and during the last 3000 years. In contrast, lake levels are mostly high during the Early and Mid-Holocene. The record also shows sub-millennial- to centennial-scale decreases in Western Mediterranean winter rain at 11.4, 10.3, 9.2, 8.2, 7.2, 6.6, 6.0, 5.4, 5.0, 4.4, 3.5, 2.9, 2.2, 1.9, 1.7, 1.5, 1.0, 0.7, and 0.2 cal ka BP. Early Holocene winter rain minima are in phase with cooling events and millennial-scale meltwater discharges in the sub-polar North Atlantic. Our proxy parameters do not show so far a clear impact of Saharan air masses on Mediterranean hydro-climate in North Africa. However, a significant hydro-climatic shift at the end of the African Humid Period (-5 ka) indicates a change in climate forcing mechanisms. The Late Holocene climate variability in the Middle Atlas features a multi-centennial-scale NAO-type pattern, with Atlantic cooling and Western Mediterranean winter rain maxima generally associated with solar minima.

J	LANDRUM, PF				LANDRUM, PF			TOXICOKINETICS OF ORGANIC XENOBIOTICS IN THE AMPHIPOD, PONTOPOREIA-HOYI - ROLE OF PHYSIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												The accumulation and elimination kinetics of selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyl congeners were determined for the amphipod, Pontoporeia hoyi, the major benthic invertebrate in the Great Lakes. Rates measured during the course of several field seasons, along with environmental and physiological variables, indicated that for compounds less water soluble than anthracene, the uptake rate constant (Ku) is inversely proportional to the mass of the organisms and directly proportional to experimental temperature. The role of temperature was again limited to the more water insoluble compounds. The depuration rate constant (Kd) was inversely proportional to the octanol-water partition coefficient, the mass of the organism, and the lipid content of the organisms. Kd was directly proportional to temperature, although the effect of temperature was again insignificant for the very water soluble biphenyl. The magnitude of the thermal effect was lower during the summer and early fall when the lipid content of the organisms was high. Both the uptake and elimination kinetics are dependent on a variety of physiological and environmental factors. The kinetic parameter must be normalized for the various factors before comparisons of kinetics in P. hoyi between collections at different times during the year and different sampling sites can be made.																			0166-445X	1879-1514				MAR	1988	12	3					245	271		10.1016/0166-445X(88)90026-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0166-445X(88)90026-4													WOS:A1988M976700005

Within the Long Gang Volcanic Field (LGVF) in N.E. China eight maar- or crater lakes with water depths between 15 and 127 m are located. The seasonal climate with strong influence of the East Asian summer- and winter monsoon and the position of the LGVF at the northern margin of the East Asian dust storm tracks make these lakes key archives for palaeoclimatic studies. In the course of a site Survey for a deep lake coring water samples and short sediment cores were investigated from all of these lakes. Detailed pollen investigations of the last 900 years from Lake Sihailongwan, an ideally bowl-shaped maar lake with 50 m water depth, revealed a very stable vegetation cover, except for the last 150 years which shows increasing anthropogenic influence. No evidence could be found in the pollen record for a climatic deterioration comparable to the European Little Ice Age. However, climatic variations can be revealed from high-resolution geochemical and sedimentological investigations on a decadal to annual scale.

The study determined the effects of increased water temperatures in artificial lakes during winter on predicting changes in the biomass of zooplankton taxa and their environment. We applied an innovative approach to investigate the effects of winter warming on zooplankton and physico-chemical factors. We used a modelling scheme combining hierarchical clustering, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithms. Under the influence of increased water temperatures in winter, weight- and frequency-dominant Crustacea taxa such as Daphnia cucullata, Cyclops vicinus, Cryptocyclops bicolor, copepodites and nauplii, and the Rotifera: Polyarthra longiremis, Trichocerca pusilla, Keratella quadrata, Asplanchna priodonta and Synchaeta spp. tend to decrease their biomass. Under the same conditions, Rotifera: Lecane spp., Monommata maculata, Testudinella patina, Notholca squamula, Colurella colurus, Trichocerca intermedia and the protozoan species Centropyxis acuelata and Arcella discoides with lower size and abundance responded with an increase in biomass. Decreases in chlorophyll a, suspended solids and total nitrogen were predicted due to winter warming. Machine learning ensemble models used in innovative ways can contribute to the research utility of studies on the response of ecological units to environmental change.

This study evaluated methods of mass-marking juvenile walleyes by immersion in an oxytetracycline (OTC) solution and assessed their subsequent contribution to natural populations in South Dakota lakes. The efficacy of marking walleye fry was evaluated at OTC concentrations of 500 and 700 mg/L; fry marked at 700 mg/L had brighter, more easily distinguished marks than did those marked at 500 mg/L. Test-pond fingerlings marked as fry at 700 mg/L all exhibited marks. Hatchery-pond returns of walleye fingerlings 35-45 d after marking suggested no significant differences in the survival of unmarked fry and those marked at 500 or 700 mg/L. The annual (1996-1998) contribution to electrofishing catch per unit effort (CPUE defined as catch per hour) of fall age-0 walleyes in four lakes averaged 93% (range, 81-100%) for stocked fry and 87% (32-100%) for stocked fingerlings. Moderately strong to strong year-classes of fall age-0 walleyes were observed for 11 of 12 year-classes in lakes stocked with fry and 8 of 16 year-classes in takes stocked with fingerlings. Gill-net CPUE (number/set) of a.-e-l and older walleyes in summer 1999 and 2000 sampling exceeded the South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks objective of 15 fish/h in two of four fry-stocked lakes but was less than 8 fish/h in all fingerling-stocked lakes.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2002	22	3					985	994		10.1577/1548-8675(2002)022<0985:ETCOSW>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8675(2002)022<0985:ETCOSW>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000177486800032

The lakes were small (130-157 ha), shallow, (< 15 m) and mesotrophic. During summer, algae accounted for up to 57-75% by volume of ingested matter in A. lomondi and U. uncinata depending on the lake; in winter the corresponding range was 10-22%. Dominant algae found in the gut included the diatoms Surirella robusta, Diploneis puella, Amphora ovalis, Strephanodiscus astraea, Fragilaria construens and Achnanthes minutissima. Although the same taxa were ingested by L. claparedeianus, algae always represented < 5% by volume of the gut contents. This possibly reflects subsurface feeding in an area where algae were rare. The length distribution of ingested diatoms, ranging from 9-250 .mu.m, was similar regardless of species in both lakes. There was no partitioning of algal food resources among oligochaetes.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1981	83	2					241	244		10.1007/BF00008272	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008272													WOS:A1981ME24600007

Timing of spring events changes under modelled future climate scenarios in a mesotrophic lake	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Lakes experience shifts in the timing of physical and biogeochemical events as a result of climate warming, and relative changes in the timing of events may have important ecological consequences. Spring, in particular, is a period in which many key processes that regulate the ecology and biogeochemistry of lakes occur and also a time that may experience significant changes under the influence of global warming. In this study, we used a coupled catchment-lake model forced by future climate projections to evaluate changes in the timing of spring discharge, ice-off, the spring phytoplankton peak, and the onset of stratification in a temperate mesotrophic lake. Although the model explained only part of the variation in these events, the overall patterns were simulated with little bias. All four events showed a clear trend towards earlier occurrence under climate warming, with ice cover tending to disappear at the end of the century in the most extreme climate scenario. Moreover, relative shifts in the timing of these springtime events also occurred, with the onset of stratification tending to advance more slowly than the other events and the spring phytoplankton peak and ice-off advancing faster in the most extreme climate scenario. The outcomes of this study stress the impact of climate change on the phenology of events in lakes and especially the relative shifts in timing during spring. This can have profound effects on food web dynamics as well as other regulatory processes and influence the lake for the remainder of the growing season.

Radioisotope disequilibria (Th-230/U) of peaty horizons date the Buchchagy Ice Complex deposition to 126 + 16/-13 kyr and 117 + 19/-14 kyr until 98 +/- 5 kyr and 89 +/- 5 kyr. The deposit is characterised by poorly sorted medium-to-coarse silts with cryogenic structures of horizontal ice bands, lens-like, and lens like reticulated segregation ice. Two peaty horizons within the Buchchagy Ice Complex and syngenetic ice wedges (2-4 m wide, up to 10 m high) are striking. The isotopic composition (delta O-18, delta D) of Buchchagy ice-wedge ice indicates winter conditions colder than during the MIS3 interstadial and warmer than during MIS2 stadial, and similar atmospheric winter moisture sources as during the MIS2 stadial. Buchchagy Ice Complex pollen spectra reveal tundra-steppe vegetation and harsher summer conditions than during the MIS3 interstadial and rather similar vegetation as during the MIS2 stadial. Short-term climatic variability during MIS5 is reflected in the record. Even though the regional chronostratigraphic relationship of the Buchchagy Ice Complex to the Last Interglacial remains unclear because numerical dating is widely lacking, the present study indicates permafrost (Ice Complex) formation during MIS5 sensu lato, and its preservation afterwards. Palaeoenvironmental insights into past climate and the periglacial landscape dynamics of arctic lowlands in eastern Siberia are deduced from the record. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Meteotsunami occurrences and causes in Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The occurrence of meteotsunamis in Lake Michigan is quantified at 10 locations from up to 20 years of historical water level records. Meteotsunami height data are fit with Pareto Type 1 and Generalized Pareto Distributions to estimate exceedance probabilities. The annual meteotsunami return level exceeds 0.25 m at all but two stations, with the largest annual return level of 0.62 m at Calumet Harbor. Analysis of radar imagery indicates that Lake Michigan meteotsunamis are associated primarily with convective storm structures, with a considerable contribution from frontal storms as well. Meteotsunami association with convective storm structures is more prevalent in southern Lake Michigan while frontal storm structures have a greater association with meteotsunamis in northern Lake Michigan. Water depths in southern Lake Michigan are conducive to Proudman resonance with convective storms while the northern Lake Michigan is too deep to meet Proudman resonance criteria, suggesting Greenspan edge wave resonance as the likely generation mechanism. Interestingly, meteotsunami events occur primarily in the late spring and early summer, approximately 1 month before the peak convective storm season but after the peak cyclone season. Overall, this statistical analysis provides valuable insight into the spatial and temporal trends in meteotsunami occurrence in Lake Michigan needed to estimate the risk posed by these dangerous coastal hazards.					; Wu, Chin/C-2042-2009	Kristovich, David/0000-0001-9381-1053; Wu, Chin/0000-0001-8393-1940; Bechle, Adam/0000-0001-9335-2344													2169-9275	2169-9291				DEC	2015	120	12					8422	8438		10.1002/2015JC011317	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015JC011317													WOS:000369153200040
J	Mao, ZG; Gu, XH; Zeng, QF; Pan, GQ				Mao, ZhiGang; Gu, XiaoHong; Zeng, QingFei; Pan, Guoquan			Seasonal and spatial variations of the food web structure in a shallow eutrophic lake assessed by stable isotope analysis	FISHERIES SCIENCE												Stable isotope analysis was used to investigate seasonal and spatial variations of the food web structure in a large eutrophic lake ecosystem (Lake Taihu, China). Basal food sources, invertebrates and fish were sampled in two lake regions with different environmental conditions and spatial variations in the isotopic composition of lake food webs were found. Overall, more depleted delta C-13 and enriched delta N-15 isotope values of organic matter sources and consumers were found in the phytoplankton-dominated lake region than in the macrophyte-dominated region. Wide seasonal variations in the isotopic ratios were also observed in the lake biota, with a general trend towards enriched delta C-13 and delta N-15 values in summer and depleted values in winter. This pattern could be explained by a combination of environmental (e.g., irradiance and nutrient inputs) and biotic (e.g., availability of food sources and plasticity in prey item choice) features. Results of isotope mass balance suggest that macrophytes provide some trophic support in the macrophyte-dominated area, but in both lake regions it is more likely that aquatic food webs are phytoplankton based rather than macrophyte based under eutrophic conditions.

J	Sachse, D; Kahmen, A; Gleixner, G				Sachse, Dirk; Kahmen, Ansgar; Gleixner, Gerd			Significant seasonal variation in the hydrogen isotopic composition of leaf-wax lipids for two deciduous tree ecosystems (Fagus sylvativa and Acer pseudoplatanus)	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Compound specific hydrogen isotope ratios (delta D) of long chain sedimentary n-alkanes, which mostly originate from the leaf waxes of higher terrestrial plants, are increasingly employed as paleoclimate proxies. While soil water is the ultimate hydrogen source for these lipids and the isotopic fractionation during biosynthesis of lipids is thought to remain constant, environmental parameters and plant physiological processes can alter the apparent hydrogen isotopic fractionation between leaf-wax lipids and a plant's source water. However, the magnitude and timing of these effects and their influence on the isotopic composition of lipids from higher terrestrial plants are still not well understood. Therefore we investigated the seasonal variability of leaf-wax n-alkane delta D values for two different temperate deciduous forest ecosystems that are dominated by two different tree species, Beech (Fagus sylvatica) and Maple (Acer pseudoplatanus). We found significant seasonal variations for both tree species in n-alkane delta D values of up to 40%. on timescales as short as one week. Also, the isotopic difference between different n-alkanes from the same plant species did vary significantly and reached up to 50 parts per thousand at the same time when overall n-alkane concentrations were lowest. Since delta D values of soil water at 5 and 10 cm depth, which we assume represent the delta D value of the major water source for the investigated beech trees, were enriched in autumn compared to the spring by 30 parts per thousand, whereas n-alkane delta D values increased only by 10 parts per thousand, we observed variations in the apparent fractionation between beech leaf derived n-alkanes and soil water of up to 20 parts per thousand on a seasonal scale. This observed change in the apparent fractionation was likely caused by differences in leaf water isotopic enrichment. Based on mechanistic leaf water models we conclude that changes in the isotopic difference between water vapor and soil water were the most likely reason for the observed changes in the apparent fractionation between n-alkanes and soil water. The large variability of n-alkane concentrations and delta D values over time implies a continuous de nova synthesis of these compounds over the growing season with turnover times possibly as short as weeks. The signal to reach the soil therefore represents an integrated record of the last weeks before leaf senescence. This holds true also for the sedimentary record of small catchment lakes in humid, temperate climates, where wind transport of leaf-wax lipids is negligible compared to transfer through soil and the massive input of leaves directly into the lake in autumn.

The effects of the NAO on the ice phenology of Spanish alpine lakes	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Three Spanish alpine lakes located in the Central Range (Pealara Lake and Cimera Lake) and the Pyrenees (Redon Lake) are selected to understand the effects of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on ice phenology. A conceptual lake model is formulated based on Pearson's correlation coefficients obtained between season-scale time series of the NAO index, climatic data (i.e., precipitation, air temperature and snow data) and limnological variables (ice phenology records). The results suggest that the effects of the NAO are only reflected in the thawing process via the air temperature and the insulating effect of snow accumulation on the ice cover. An altitude component is evident in our survey because the effects of the NAO on Pealara Lake (the lowest altitude studied lake) are restricted to winter, whereas for Redon Lake (the highest altitude studied lake), the effects extend into spring. A latitudinal component is also clear when comparing our data with northern European lakes. Snow accumulation primarily depends on the air temperature at high latitudes, and both precipitation and the air temperature control snow accumulation at lower latitudes. Consequently, in northern Europe, the NAO signal is primarily reflected in lake ice phenology via the air temperature, whereas our results confirm that in southern Europe, the strong dependence of precipitation on the NAO determines the importance of the NAO for lake ice cover.

Like other bacteria, thermophiles are not easily cultivated using conventional culture methods. We used an advanced cultivation method, the filter plate microbial trap (FPMT), to isolate bacteria from thermal springs. In total, 184 isolates were obtained from five thermal springs using the FPMT and standard agar plate method, and their 16S rRNA gene sequences were analyzed. FPMT allowed us to obtain a culture collection that was larger, richer, and more novel than that obtained by standard cultivation. Seven novel species were obtained using the FPMT technique, whereas only one was isolated using a standard cultivation. We also found clear differences in the patterns of phylogenetic diversity and physiological properties between isolates from two cultivation methods. The results have encouraged us to apply the FPMT method in other extreme environments and offer further support for fostering the development of new cultivation methods.

Increasing our understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of HFRS infections could guide local prevention and control strategies. Methodology/Principal Findings: We employed statistical models to analyze HFRS case data together with environmental data from the Dongting Lake district during 2005-2010. Specifically, time-specific ecologic niche models (ENMs) were used to quantify and identify risk factors associated with HFRS transmission as well as forecast seasonal variation in risk across geographic areas. Results showed that the Maximum Entropy model provided the best predictive ability (AUC = 0.755). Time-specific Maximum Entropy models showed that the potential risk areas of HFRS significantly varied across seasons. High-risk areas were mainly found in the southeastern and southwestern areas of the Dongting Lake district. Our findings based on models focused on the spring and winter seasons showed particularly good performance. The potential risk areas were smaller in March, May and August compared with those identified for June, July and October to December. Both normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land use types were found to be the dominant risk factors. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings indicate that time-specific ENMs provide a useful tool to forecast the spatial and temporal risk of HFRS.

Lake Constance is an important overwintering site for waterbirds in Central Europe because it provides sufficient food sources to meet energy demands during the winter months. In this study we focussed on the submerged vegetation and its associated macroinvertebrate fauna as a food source. We conducted experiments with exclosure cages which protected evergreen charophytes from bird grazing and compared the mass decline throughout the winter to unprotected grazed sites. Furthermore, we assessed the change in macrophyte-associated macroinvertebrates during the course of winter. We found that wintering waterbirds caused a significant decline of charophytes and their associated macroinvertebrates down to a depth of 4 m. We determined the taxa and abundance of macroinvertebrates associated with charophytes and predominantly found Dreissena polymorpha. At sites protected from bird grazing, the biomass of the macroinvertebrate fauna increased relative to the plant biomass during the course of winter. This might also have affected the foraging behaviour of diving waterbirds.

In this study, the vegetation and bloom indices (VBI) algorithm were used to interpret submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), floating/emergent aquatic vegetation (FEAV), and algal bloom (AB). The dynamics of AV and their influencing factors in Bao' an Lake, in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River in China, were studied from 2000 to 2023. The results showed that (1) the VBI algorithm can accurately distinguish AV and AB of different life forms with an overall accuracy of 93% and a kappa coefficient of 0.86. (2) Macrophyte coverage decreases. AV grew vigorously in spring, and SAV was the dominant type within it, whereas AV coverage was low in summer, and SAV had no summer species for a long time. In 2000, the coverage of AV was the highest, reaching 64.5%, but a gradual decrease that followed in the coming years finally led to a coverage percentage of less than 5% by 2023. (3) The correlation between SAV coverage and total phosphorus (p < 0.01), total nitrogen (p < 0.05), and water depth/transparency (p < 0.05) in Bao' an Lake were 0.23, 0.28, and 0.32, respectively. (4) The SAV species experienced three stages: richness (before 2003), monotonicity (2004-2020), and final disappearance (2021-present). This study shows that the coverage of AV in Bao' an Lake is too low and the number of SAV species is one (2010-now). Therefore, it is necessary to implement measures to improve vegetation coverage and diversity.					; Lin, Xiaowen/MFH-7499-2025; Wu, Xiaodong/ITT-3925-2023	Lin, Xiaowen/0009-0009-9375-7128; Wu, Xiaodong/0000-0002-7218-4123													2223-7747					NOV	2024	13	21							3090	10.3390/plants13213090	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants13213090								39520010					WOS:001352493600001

Understanding the population status and trends of birds with different life histories and habitats can guide efforts to secure water resources needed to sustain bird habitats. We used a 21-year dataset to examine population trends for 24 survey units for migratory shorebirds, waterfowl, and other waterbirds at Great Salt Lake and associated wetlands. We found stable or positive trends for 36 of 37 species or groups in fall, spring, or both seasons when considering survey units in aggregate. Stable, positive, and negative trends were observed in individual survey units. Foraging technique, migration distance, and taxonomic groupings were unrelated to trend direction. Research is needed to test whether survey units represent high-quality habitat. With declining regional water resources, stable and positive aggregate trends reinforce the importance of surveyed units at Great Salt Lake and associated wetlands to wetland-dependent birds. Ensuring continuation of stable and positive trends will require identifying environmental factors-including water quantity and quality-driving trends, and require coordinated regional management and monitoring of wetland-dependent birds.

J	COOPER, CM				COOPER, CM			PERSISTENT ORGANOCHLORINE AND CURRENT USE INSECTICIDE CONCENTRATIONS IN MAJOR WATERSHED COMPONENTS OF MOON LAKE, MISSISSIPPI, USA	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Concentrations of persistent insecticides DDT, DDD, DDE and toxaphene were compared with three currently used insecticides (fenvalerate, permethrin, and methyl parathion) in major watershed components of Moon Lake, Mississippi and its 166 km2 watershed. Moon Lake (10.1 km2), an oxbow of the Mississippi River, receives drainage through a series of wetlands from farmland intensively cultivated in cotton, soybeans, and rice. All watershed components were contaminated by DDT. Ten years after being banned, SIGMA-DDT was present in soil, wetland and lake sediments, surface water, and fish. Residual insecticide concentrations were significantly higher in aqueous/sediment phases of surface waters during the winter/spring wet season than during dry season. This period of maximum runoff corresponded to minimum ground cover and maximum soil disturbance. Increased concentrations during periods of runoff emphasizes the magnitude of the DDT source that remains in soil (xBAR = 369.3-mu-g/kg) and indicates the importance of watershed management practices on long-term water quality. Current use insecticides were not detected in soils. In other watershed components, they were found less frequently, more sporadically, and in lower concentrations than persistent insecticides. However, the detection of these acutely toxic insecticides, especially methyl parathion, in fish tissue showed that these insecticides have sufficient persistence for uptake and, perhaps, bioaccumulation.																			0003-9136					MAR	1991	121	1					103	113																WOS:A1991FJ50900007

Around 30 specimens were collected each month in the region of Lami, municipality of Porto Alegre, state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, from January, 2003 to August, 2005. The minimum, the maximum, and the mean carapace length of males, females, juveniles and individuals with ootestis were recorded. The frequency distribution by size classes, the sexual proportion, the recruitment, and the reproductive period were analyzed. A total of 766 specimens were collected, from which 315 were males (41.12%), 278 were females (36.30%), 166 were juveniles (21.67%), and seven individuals had ootestis (0.91%). Males and females were present in all months and in all size classes. The highest frequency of individuals matched the size classes from 24 to 30 mm. The highest frequency of juveniles was recorded during the spring of 2003 and the summer 2005. Significant differences in the size of males and females were recorded in the size classes between 26 and 30 mm. The sex ratio between all males and females was 1:0.88 (chi(2) = 2.3, p > 0.05). The proportion between males and females showed significant differences between the size classes 26-28 mm (chi(2) = 5.43, p < 0.05) and 28-30 mm (chi(2) = 4.77, p < 0.05) carapace length, were the number of males was highest.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of three different cropping systems on soil erosion by surface runoff in the clay hills of the Marche region (central Italy). In this area, cropping systems are based on annual arable crops such as sunflower and durum wheat, which can benefit of subsidies through the Common Agricultural Policy. These systems replaced the traditional share cropping system, characterised by the integration of livestock, forage crops, cereals and vineyards. This paper reports the first four years of results of a soil erosion monitoring experiment set up in 1994 in a representative hilly area of the Marche. Three cropping systems were compared: HL: sunflower-durum wheat rotation with conventional inputs; LI: sunflower-durum wheat rotation with restricted inputs on fertilisers and herbicides; SA: set-aside managed with mechanical (1994) or chemical (1995-96-97) control of weeds. Soil loss occurred mostly during occasional summer rains characterised by high intensity (I-20max UP to 60 mm h(-1)) under the sunflower cover and a relatively high soil humidity (without cracking). In summer 1995, which was exceptionally wet (over 650 mm from June to September), soil loss was as high as 60-80 t ha(-1) on the sunflower cover (HI and LI cropping systems) and 10 t ha-1 on the set-aside dead vegetation sprayed with herbicides. The soil loss measured on wheat cover in 1994 and 1996 was relatively low when the soil was fully covered. The fertiliser and herbicide restrictions had no significant effects on soil loss, while straw residues significantly reduced soil losses in autumn 1996, when compared to the ploughed bare soil.

This may have given rise to a skewed perception of shallow lakes as being well mixed, turbid and dominated by ecosystem respiration relative to primary production. Mixing patterns and ecosystem metabolism in five oligotrophic shallow lakes dominated by charophytes were investigated in order to determine gross primary production, ecosystem respiration, their regulation and mutual coupling in this very common lake type. Although lakes were very shallow (< 0.5 m), high charophyte biomass caused strong daytime stratification followed by nocturnal mixing. Despite the nutrient-poor water, volumetric rates of production and respiration during spring-summer were high compared to most medium to large lakes. This intensive metabolism is likely a result of the high charophyte biomass and the shallow mixed surface layer. Areal rates of production and respiration were also high compared to values from other aquatic systems. Strong coupling between daily rates of production and respiration suggested that the majority of organic substrates for ecosystem respiration were produced within the lakes. Net ecosystem production was slightly positive during the growth season. This study highlights the role of submerged macrophytes as primary drivers of temperature dynamics, stratification-mixing as well as high metabolism in small, shallow lakes with dense vegetation.

Iestyn			Disproportionate impact of atmospheric heat events on lake surface water temperature increases	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE												Hot temperature extremes (HTEs) in the atmosphere can also affect lake surface water temperature, but how this impact changes with global warming is not well understood. Here we use numerical modelling and satellite observations to quantify the contribution of HTEs to variations in summer lake surface water temperature and lake heatwaves in 1,260 water bodies worldwide between 1979 and 2022. Over this time period, HTE duration and cumulative intensity over the studied lakes increased significantly, at average rates of 1.4 days per decade and 0.92 degrees C days per decade, respectively. Despite only accounting for 7% of the total summer days, HTEs are responsible for 24% of lake surface summer warming trends, with the most pronounced effect observed in Europe at 27%. Moreover, HTEs are key drivers of both the duration and cumulative intensity of lake heatwaves. Our findings underscore the pivotal role played by short-term climatic extreme events in shaping long-term lake surface water temperature dynamics.					; Zhang, Yunlin/N-5464-2014; Shi, Kun/O-2638-2013	Qin, Boqiang/0000-0003-3977-4903; Zhang, Yunlin/0000-0002-3382-4570; Shi, Kun/0000-0002-6124-7512; Wang, Xiwen/0000-0002-9153-6569													1758-678X	1758-6798				NOV	2024	14	11								10.1038/s41558-024-02122-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41558-024-02122-y		SEP 2024											WOS:001314871800002
J	DiDonato, GT; Stiven, AE				DiDonato, GT; Stiven, AE			Experimental studies of interactions between two unionids, Elliptio waccamawensis and Leptodea ochracea: Variation in negative and positive effects	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												We conducted a field experiment in Lake Waccamaw, North Carolina, to elucidate the responses of two unionids (Elliptio waccamawensis and Leptodea ochracea) to varying population densities. Field enclosures at two depths maintained each species in low, mixed culture, and high densities; intra- and interspecific interactions were inferred from changes in growth, tissue mass, and shell mass. The experiment lasted one year (May, 1995-1996), with interim data collected in September, 1995. E. waccamawensis did not respond to density manipulations over the annual experimental period; however, its growth was significantly reduced in the presence of L. ochracea during summer at the deeper site. This negative effect on E. waccamawensis is consistent with competition for resources, and a laboratory experiment estimating mussel grazing rates provided supporting evidence. For L. ochracea, density had no effect on annual growth at the deeper site; at the shallow site, however, high density significantly increased growth. Winter data revealed both negative and positive density-dependence. L. ochracea in high density treatments grew significantly less at the deep site but demonstrated increased growth at the shallow location. Thus, both negative and positive interactions occur in this mussel assemblage and vary with season and depth.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				JUN	2001	16	2					303	316		10.1080/02705060.2001.9663815	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2001.9663815													WOS:000169035500016

To refine the African wintering ranges of these two species, we made an effort to collect as much distributional data as possible. We then used the available point-locality data to predict the wintering distributions using a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) based inductive modelling technique called BIOCLIM. For this purpose, we developed four environmental GIS layers that are presumed to reflect the environmental preferences of migrant birds. Our data showed that the known winter distribution of the Basra reed warbler was concentrated in Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi and Mozambique, where it was usually found in dense vegetation growing in coastal scrub, woodland thickets, swamps, marshes, flooded pools and grasslands, and along ditches and edges of rivers, ponds, lagoons and lakes. The predicted winter distribution of this species includes most of East Africa but, given the habitat preferences of this species, is probably limited to low-lying areas near the coastline. The known winter distribution of the cinereous bunting is so far limited to Eritrea, where the species has been observed in October, November, February and March, in sparsely vegetated, sandy or rocky habitats on coastal plains and deserts. The predicted winter distribution of this species includes the plains and hills along the Red Sea coasts in southern Egypt, Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan, as well as a few inland areas in Sudan, Ethiopia and Kenya.

Thinking Like a Duck: Fall Lake Use and Movement Patterns of Juvenile Ring-Necked Ducks before Migration	PLOS ONE												The post-fledging period is one of the least studied portions of the annual cycle in waterfowl. Yet, recruitment into the breeding population requires that young birds have sufficient resources to survive this period. We used radio-telemetry and generalized estimating equations to examine support for four hypotheses regarding the drivers of landscape scale habitat use and movements made by juvenile ring-necked ducks between the pre-fledging period and departure for migration. Our response variables included the probability of movement, distances moved, and use of different lake types: brood-rearing lakes, staging lakes, and lakes with low potential for disturbance. Birds increased their use of staging areas and lakes with low potential for disturbance (i.e., without houses or boat accesses, >100 m from roads, or big lakes with areas where birds could sit undisturbed) throughout the fall, but these changes began before the start of the hunting season and their trajectory was not changed by the onset of hunting. Males and females moved similar distances and had similar probabilities of movements each week. However, females were more likely than males to use brood-rearing lakes later in the fall. Our findings suggest juvenile ring-necked ducks require different lake types throughout the fall, and managing solely for breeding habitat will be insufficient for meeting needs during the post-fledging period. Maintaining areas with low potential for disturbance and areas suitable for staging will ensure that ring-necked ducks have access to habitat throughout the fall.					; Fieberg, John/Y-3988-2019	Fieberg, John/0000-0002-3180-7021; 													1932-6203					FEB 14	2014	9	2							e88597	10.1371/journal.pone.0088597	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0088597								24551123					WOS:000331271500051

Anti-phase oscillation of Asian monsoons during the Younger Dryas period: Evidence from peat cellulose δ13C of Hani, Northeast China	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Significant changes in the global atmospheric and oceanic circulation system occurred during the Younger Dryas cold period. Several researchers have demonstrated a weakening of intensity of the Indian Ocean Summer Monsoon during that period. However, the exact characteristics of the East Asian Summer Monsoon still remain vague. Here we present a late-glacial precipitation proxy record of the East Asian Summer Monsoon, based on the peat cellulose delta C-13 found in Hani, Northeast China. Both the peat cellulose record and a pollen record from Lake Sihailongwan sediment indicate an abrupt increase in precipitation in the region during the Younger Dryas period. These results support the occurrence of wet conditions in the north and of dry conditions in the south of the Chinese Mainland during that period. By examining the activity of the East Asian Summer Monsoon on an interannual timescale, we propose a theory for the anomalous precipitation distribution that we attribute to the occurrence of an El Nino-like phenomenon in the Equatorial Pacific Ocean during the Younger Dryas. In this case, the intensity of the Western Pacific subtropical high may strengthen, and its position over the western Pacific Ocean may move northward. This could cause an enhancement of the East Asian Summer Monsoon and migration of a monsoonal rainbelt towards the northern region of the Chinese mainland, resulting in a precipitation distribution of wet conditions in the north and dry conditions in the south. Therefore, this anomalous rainfall distribution should be considered to indicate the strengthening of the East Asian Summer Monsoon, in anti-phase with the Indian Ocean Summer monsoon that weakened during the same period. This agrees with the previously revealed anti-phase variations of the two monsoons during the ice-rafted debris cold events of the North Atlantic Ocean. It appears that, in relation to the abrupt temperature drop in the Northern Hemisphere on centennial to millennial time scales, anti-phase variations of the two Asian summer monsoons occurred.

There was a downstream decrease in the number of species present in the lake outlet stream, no such change being discernible in the spring-fed stream. Taking the sampling site nearest the source of the spring-fed stream as the reference point, there was a downstream increase in dissimilarity and this increase was maintained upstream from the confluence in the lake-fed stream. Apart from generalists, all functional feeding groups showed decreased numbers from the lake outlet to the confluence in the lake-fed stream. In the spring-fed stream, densities of functional groups increased downstream, with the exception of grazers and generalists. There were indications of more predictable changes along the lake-fed stream compared to the spring-fed one, which seemed more influenced by site-specific factors.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1985	124	1					65	71		10.1007/BF00011399	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00011399													WOS:A1985AHY2100009

This study simulated the effect of 0.1 g/L GO on denitrification in lake sediments under summer (28 degrees C) and winter temperatures (8 degrees C). GO promoted carbon source metabolism and denitrification. Phylogenetic bin-based null model analysis suggested that GO significantly altered the contribution of heterogeneous selection in bacterial and archaeal community assembly. The co-occurrence network indicated that bacterial communities responded to the enhancement of heterogeneous selection by strategies of enhancing positive correlation and shared niche, whereas archaeal communities adopted strategies of enhancing negative correlation and competition. Bacterial networks also emerged with more non-hub connector species that could drive changes in community structure. Our study contributed to the understanding of different ecological strategies adopted by bacterial and archaeal communities in response to changes in ecological selection driven by GO.					; Liao, Yinhao/JHU-1126-2023; ji, guodong/KDM-5048-2024; Li, Shengjie/NJS-9095-2025	Li, Shengjie/0000-0002-2371-5143; Ji, Guodong/0000-0002-0195-2367; Liao, Yinhao/0009-0005-7142-7831; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				SEP 10	2022	838		4						156549	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156549	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156549		JUN 2022						35688242					WOS:000877536400014

A contribution to mapping freshwater ecosystem services	METHODSX												Although urban areas negatively impact the environment, they supply a wide range of ecosystem services (ES), mainly cultural ones. Recreation near urban green areas is widespread, including fishing. In northern latitudes, during the winter, lakes are frozen, and several urban dwellers practice ice fishing. Although this activity is well known, no attempts were made to assess and map winter recreational fishery ES supply in lakes. In this work, we developed a methodology to map this ES, taking an urban lake in Vilnius (Lithuania) as an example. A standardized protocol was developed using an unmanned aerial vehicle (proximal sensing), further georeferencing and correcting the gathered images, vectorizing the fishing ice holes, and mapping them using two different methods: Kernel and Point Density. The method developed in this work can be applied in northern areas to identify recreational fishing ES during the winter. center dot A novel method was developed to map winter recreational fishery ES supply in lakes; center dot High -resolution images were taken from an unmanned aerial vehicle to identify fishing ice holes in an urban lake. center dot The method maps a cultural ES, which is trendy in northern latitudes.

J	Kim, D; Kim, Y; Kim, B				Kim, Donghwan; Kim, Yoonhee; Kim, Bomchul			Simulation of eutrophication in a reservoir by CE-QUAL-W2 for the evaluation of the importance of point sources and summer monsoon	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Kim D, Kim Y, Kim B. Simulation of eutrophication in a reservoir by CE-QUAL-W2 for the evaluation of the importance of point sources and summer monsoon. Lake Reserv Manage. 35:64-76. Water quality was modeled by a 2-dimensional model (CE-QUAL-W2) in a reservoir (Lake Uiam, Korea) receiving nutrients from both nonpoint sources and point sources. Due to the summer monsoon climate and the aggregated seasonal precipitation pattern, the phosphorus export from nonpoint sources is severely concentrated in the rainy season. For several decades, a sewage treatment plant (STP) on the shore of the lake has been releasing effluent, which was suspected as the major cause of eutrophication. However, the total annual phosphorus loading from the STP was smaller than the loadings from nonpoint sources, which aroused skepticism about the effectiveness of an additional chemical P-removal process in the STP as a eutrophication control strategy. The result of scenario simulations in this study showed that P reduction in the STP effluent from 0.9 mg/L to 0.1 mg/L would effectively reduce the chlorophyll a concentration in the lake by 62%. According to the results of the simulation, the addition of a chemical P-removal process was suggested to the municipal government and was installed in 2012. After the process, the chlorophyll a concentration in the lake decreased as predicted in the simulation. The effect of phosphorus loading can have quite different effects on phytoplankton growth depending on the runoff pattern and hydrological characteristics of the receiving water bodies. Flow rate and nutrient loadings are very dynamic, far from a steady state, in the summer monsoon regions, which may be a unique limnological feature of East Asian countries.

Relative importance of external and internal phosphorus loadings on affecting lake water quality in agricultural landscapes	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Internal phosphorus (P) loading from the sediment poses a high risk of being an additional P source to deteriorate water quality. Previous studies hypothesized that internal P loads can be as high as external P inputs, especially in P enriched landscapes such as agricultural areas. However, internal P loadings in eutrophic conditions are rarely quantified or compared with external P loads. In this study, we aimed to answer these three questions; 1) how much P is internally released from the sediment of hypereutrophic lakes? 2) how much do internal P loads contribute to lake water quality compared to external loads? and 3) what factors regulate the release and retention of P in the sediment? We selected four hypereutrophic lakes located in Eastern Nebraska. In the study lakes and watersheds, internal and external P loads were quantified in 2014. Total P concentrations of inflow water collected from primary water channels feeding the study lakes and daily inflow water discharge rates were used to calculate external P loads. Internal P loads were quantified from flow-through soil core incubation experiments. External TP loads varied temporarily depending on the changes in discharge, and were highest during spring storm events. The majority of internal P loading (i.e. P release from sediment) occurred in the summer when lakes experience strong stratification (i.e. anaerobic conditions). This is likely associated with oxygen availability in the sediments and chemical dissolution of P. By comparing the annual-scale of external and internal P inputs, external P loadings were still the dominant P source to the lakes, contributing up to 98% of the total P input whereas internal P loadings accounted for 4-12% of the total P input. Although internal P loads were relatively minor on an annual time scale, we found that summer internal loadings in some of study lakes exceeded their external loadings. Our results confirmed the dominant influence of external P loadings on water quality in the reservoirs. This suggests that non-point source controls and watershed management strategies to reduce external loadings should be implemented prior to internal P loading controls. Internal P loadings can be a significant P source, even if just temporarily, worsening water quality of agricultural reservoirs and downstream ecosystems in the summer. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Tolonen, A; Lappalainen, J; Pulliainen, E				Tolonen, A; Lappalainen, J; Pulliainen, E			Seasonal growth and year class strength variations of perch near the northern limits of its distribution range	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The effects of temperature on seasonal growth and year class strength of perch Perca fluviatilis were studied in a subarctic lake in northern Finland. Two growth models, power and von Bertalanffy, were used to estimate the growth of perch during the growing season from 1988 to 1990. Air temperature, estimated as degree-days >10degreesC, significantly improved both model fits. The sum of degree-days also correlated positively with the year class strength of perch. The strongest year class was born in a warm summer 1988, while the 1987 year class was totally absent, which was due to the very cold summer of that year. The backcalculation of lengths of fish caught in 1990 showed that the overall growth of perch was slow in the cold summer of 1987 and relatively rapid in the warm summer of 1988. The subsequent growth of the abundant 1988 year class was rapid, even though the summers of 1991 and 1992 were relatively cool. The improved growth could be due to the lack of competition with previous weak year classes of 1986 and 1987. This observation suggests that density-dependent factors might affect growth even near the northern limits of the distribution range of perch.

This study aims to achieve its goal by using micro-XRF data of Ti and sulfur (S), carbon isotopic compositions (delta 13C) along with elemental concentrations of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and S, and diatom analyses in the sediment core extracted from the Dream Lake (DL; 25 degrees 10 ' 01.9 '' N, 121 degrees 33 ' 36.0 '' E and elevation = 588 m above sea level), northern Taiwan. The radiocarbon dates revealed that the DL core covered the time interval from 4.5 to 0.4 cal kyr BP. The current records revealed wetter phases during 4.5-3.0 cal kyr BP, 2.0-1.7 cal kyr BP, and 1.0-0.4 cal kyr BP, characterized by the dominance of C3 plants in the DL catchment, increased runoff, and higher lake levels. Drier climates observed in the current study during 3.0-2.0 cal kyr BP and 1.7-1.0 cal kyr BP, marked by a reduction in C3 plants, decreased runoff, and lower lake levels. The northern Taiwan climate during the late Holocene was observed to be regulated by the interplay of EASM and EAWM. The wet climate conditions during 4.5-3.0 were due to the La Nina-like conditions, which led to a strong EASM resulting in high precipitation conditions. The dry climate conditions during 3.0-2.0 cal kyr BP have coincided with El Nino-like conditions during 3.0-2.4 cal kyr BP and a subsequently strong EAWM during 2.4-2.0 cal kyr BP. Both situations led to a reduction in precipitation in the region. Unlike the time frame from 4.5 to 3.0 cal kyr BP, wet climate conditions during 2.0-1.7 and 1.0-0.4 cal kyr BP have coincided with weak EAWM conditions, which led to an increase in precipitation in northern Taiwan. The dry climate noticed between 1.7 and 1.0 cal kyr BP appeared to be the impact of both El Nino-like conditions and strong EAWM.					; Chang, Yuan-Pin/C-1656-2009; Rahman, Abdur/AGI-4070-2022; Chang, Wei Cheng/LBI-1395-2024; Löwemark, Ludvig/AEJ-2518-2022	Lowemark, Ludvig/0000-0002-3337-2367; Chang, Yuan-Pin/0000-0001-8147-7860; , Abdur Rahman/0000-0001-6135-154X; Wang, Liang-Chi/0000-0002-2320-0908; Huang, Jyh-Jaan/0000-0001-8815-3957													1040-6182	1873-4553				MAY 30	2024	693						27	37		10.1016/j.quaint.2024.02.013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2024.02.013		MAY 2024											WOS:001244580300001

The species identification was based on the spore morphometry. Of 180 Nile perch, 68 were found to be naturally infected with H. ghaffari (37.7 %). A significant seasonal fluctuation in the prevalence was discerned, with the maximum rate occurring in the winter (68.8 %) and the minimum rate in the summer (8.8 %). The plasmodia of the parasite were evident as white rods, occupying almost a third of the gill filament and with mean dimensions of 0.7 x 0.2 mm. Histological investigations revealed that the present plasmodia were potentially compatible with the intrafilamental type. Infection with H. ghaffari initiated epithelial hyperplasia and curling and atrophy of the respiratory lamellae, which underpin its deleterious effect on the host by decreasing the functional respiratory surface of the gills. The present study concluded that infection with H. ghaffari originated in the River Nile before moving to the new ecosystem of Lake Wadi El-Rayan through drainage water.

QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					1st World Congress of Elephants	OCT 16-20, 2001	Rome, ITALY					Jablonski (2004) has recently argued that because hippos are totally dependent upon permanent water, the record for hippopotamid extinction across southern Asia provides a proxy record for the intensification of the monsoon in the late Neogene. As she points out, the intensification of the Asian monsoon resulted in increased seasonality, and much greater contrasts than previously between wet summers and dry winters, because of which "wide-scale, months-long drought would have been devastating to ancient hippopotamus populations" (p. 122). Their progressive extinction across southern Asia in the Early Pleistocene thus records changes in seasonal patterns of river flow brought about by, in her opinion, the intensification of the monsoon. Before accepting her argument, we need to consider when the monsoon intensified in southern Asia, the extinction dates of hippopotamids (and other animals sharing the same habitats) in the late Neogene of southern Asia, and the histories of those river basins that provide relevant fossil evidence.																			1040-6182	1873-4553					2005	126						283	287		10.1016/j.quaint.2004.05.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2004.05.001													WOS:000225425500020
J	Nürnberg, GK; Howell, T; Palmer, M				Nurnberg, Gertrud K.; Howell, Todd; Palmer, Michelle			Long-term impact of Central Basin hypoxia and internal phosphorus loading on north shore water quality in Lake Erie	INLAND WATERS												We hypothesized that north shore water quality of Lake Erie's Central Basin is impacted by Central Basin hypoxia and, by extension, related to redox-dependant internal phosphorus (P) loading from the profundal sediments. To evaluate this hypothesis, we first quantified Central Basin hypoxia as hypoxic factor (HF, days in Aug-Sep that a sediment area equal to the Central Basin surface area was hypoxic) from published annual hypoxic (<2.0 mg/L dissolved oxygen) areal extent and duration. From 1985 to 2012, mean HF values were 15.2 (SE 1.45) d/Aug-Sep and ranged between 0 (1996) and 34.3 (2012) d/Aug-Sep. Second, we estimated internal load from an areal P release rate of 8 mg/m(2)/d, multiplied by HF. The estimate of 122 (SE 11.6) mg/m(2)/Aug-Sep (1985-2012, n = 28) is supported by an independent estimate of 136 (SE 20.3) mg/m(2)/summer (1970-1986, n = 15) computed from total P concentration increases at fall turnover and by an estimate for 1970. Third, 2013 temperature and oxygen profiles demonstrated periodic upwelling on the north shore of the Central Basin, in agreement with other studies. Fourth, we analysed P, chlorophyll a (Chl-a) and phytoplankton species data at 2 north shore drinking water intake stations. HF and internal loading were significantly correlated with summer soluble reactive P, August-October Chl-a concentrations, and cyanobacteria abundance at the Central Basin site but not at the control site in the Western Basin. While these correlations are weak, suggesting other effects including benthic productivity, they may be partially caused by hypolimnetic water circulated toward the shoreline.

Many Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations leave the ocean in spring, months prior to spawning, though this curtails feeding in productive marine environments. We hypothesized that habitat features encourage the evolution of this trait by providing fish with physical and thermal refuge during their long freshwater holding period. We document substantial variation in Atlantic salmon return-migration timing across 70 Irish rivers using 8 years of angling data, validated with electronic-counter data from 23 of the rivers. A higher frequency of spring migrating salmon was observed in rivers with accessible lakes and larger rivers in general. Spring migration may have evolved in rivers with suitable holding habitat as a strategy to minimize cumulative marine mortality, which is traded off against additional marine feeding. More research on this neglected topic is needed, given the value of large spring migrating Atlantic salmon to anglers, ongoing declines in their abundance in Ireland and elsewhere, and the widespread occurrence of premature migration in salmonids generally.					; Reed, Thomas/A-5788-2012	Roche, William/0000-0003-2299-6059; Reed, Thomas/0000-0002-2993-0477; de Eyto, Elvira/0000-0003-2281-2491; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				MAY	2017	74	5					668	679		10.1139/cjfas-2016-0191	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2016-0191													WOS:000400011100004

This study aimed to analyze and quantify the intertwined effects of precipitation intensity, temperature, RFC, and land use on these two kinds of soil N losses. Methods:The DayCent models were calibrated and validated using observed data for the representative tea garden (TG), bamboo forest (BF), and mixed forest (MF) hillslopes in the southeastern hilly region of China. The N2O emissions and mineral N leaching were then simulated under a total of 882 scenarios with the combinations of three land-use types (TG, BF, and MF), seven precipitation intensities (PI, from 8 to 99.2 mm d(-1)but the total precipitation amount maintained), seven temperature conditions (from baseline -1 degrees C to baseline +2 degrees C with 0.5 degrees C increment), and six RFCs (from 0 to 50% in volume with 10% increment). Results:The TG had the greatest soil N2O emission (1.8 and 3.3 times of BF and MF, respectively) and mineral N leaching (5.5 and 36.8 times of BF and MF, respectively). On three land-use hillslopes, the greatest soil N2O emissions were observed in summer, while great mineral N leaching were generally observed in spring and winter. Peaks of N2O emissions were observed as the PI reached 59.8 mm d(-1), while peaks of mineral N leaching were always observed when the PI reached 8.0 and 59.8 mm d(-1). With temperature increasing and RFC decreasing, both types of soil N losses increased. The land use and RFC had the primary influences on both types of soil N losses compared to climate factors. Under the same RFCs, the PI had higher influence on soil N2O emission compared to temperature, while those on mineral N leaching were just opposite. Conclusion:Findings of this study would provide scientific bases for designing strategies to reduce soil N losses on the stony-soil hillslopes.					; Zhu, Qing/LSK-1739-2024; Lai, Xiaoming/KIC-7701-2024	Zhu, Qing/0000-0002-5798-3883; 													1436-8730	1522-2624				DEC	2020	183	6					637	647		10.1002/jpln.202000105	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.202000105		SEP 2020											WOS:000569808500001
J	Xia, L; Zhou, Y				Xia, Lan; Zhou, Yue			Tracking Jianghuai Cyclones in China and Their Climate Characteristics	ATMOSPHERE												A Jianghuai cyclone is an extratropical cyclone, which influences the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and Huai River basins in China. According to the definition of Jianghuai cyclones, statistics of their climate characteristics from 1979 to 2010 are obtained by an objective detection and tracking algorithm using ERA-Interim reanalysis data. The results show that the frequency of Jianghuai cyclones has a strong year-to-year variability but no obvious trend. Jianghuai cyclones are most frequent in May but fewest in December. As the cold air is active in spring, which interacts with the warm air from the southwest of the subtropical high at the Yangtze-Huai River region, it makes Jianghuai cyclones occur more frequently in this season. The main origins of Jianghuai cyclones are located in the Poyang Lake region, Dongting Lake region, and Dabie Mountain area. The maximum deepening rate of 0-2 hPa/6h is featured in 66.4% of Jianghuai cyclones. Over 40% of Jianghuai cyclones have a mean deepening rate of 0-1 hPa/6h. The lifetime of Jianghuai cyclones is short, mainly lasting for one to two days. In addition, background characteristics are compared between the formation, climax, and decaying periods of Jianghuai cyclones.

Anthropogenic trauma is the most prevalent cause of mortality in Little Penguins, Eudyptula minor, in Perth, Western Australia	EMU-AUSTRAL ORNITHOLOGY												Penguins both forage and travel in the marine environment and so spend a much greater proportion of their lives in this environment than other seabirds. This maximises their exposure to an increasing range of threats compared with other seabirds. From late 2003 to 2012, necropsies were performed on 159 Little Penguins found in the Perth region, Western Australia. Given the close proximity of the colonies to increasingly populated urban areas, the aims of this study were to: (1) determine the causes of mortality; (2) determine the proportion of deaths attributable to anthropogenic causes; (3) use this information to help guide management strategies; and (4) identify potential threats to coastal seabirds in general. In most cases, cause of mortality could be assigned to one of 11 categories. Trauma, most likely from watercraft, was the main cause of mortality. The next most common cause, starvation, was more likely to occur in spring and summer. Management strategies for colonies of Little Penguins near high levels of watercraft activity should take into account the risk of injury or death from watercraft strikes.					; Cannell, Belinda/MVU-8310-2025	Cannell, Belinda/0000-0001-9214-8958; 													0158-4197	1448-5540					2016	116	1					52	61		10.1071/MU15039	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MU15039													WOS:000370058800008

THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND QUALITATIVE ASPECTS	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												A theoretical fractionation of urban runoff P, according to its chemical mobility and potential biological impact, is presented and the P fractions feasible for routine analysis established. Urban runoff P from 2 separate storm sewer systems draining residential areas in the Lake Wingra basin (Madison, Wisconsin [USA]) was characterized. Flow-weighted mean concentrations of dissolved inorganic P (Pi) for individual runoff events ranged from 0.10-2.11 mg Pl and generally comprised .gtoreq. 79% of the total dissolved P (Pt), allowing optimization of routine P characterization by the determination of dissolved Pi (or dissolved Pt) and total P. Flow-weighted mean concentrations of total particulate P (Pt) ranged from 0.14-2.37 mg Pl. While the composition of the particulate Pt at the lower concentrations was widely variable, at the higher concentrations particulate Pt was constituted mainly of organic P (Po). Flow-weighted mean concentrations of dissolved Pi were more consistently correlated at a significant level with particulate Pt and particulate Po than with particulate Pi. The higher concentrations of dissolved and particulate P were associated with leaf and elm fruit fall, in the fall and spring, respectively, and with longer dry periods immediately before runoff events. A significant proportion (35-50%) of the particulate Pt occurring during the first flush and high flow phases of runoff events would remain suspended in the lake photic zone for several days. The upper limit for potentially available P in urban runoff can be given by dissolved Pi (or dissolved Pt) plus 0.25 .times. particulate Pt, for the watersheds studied.																			0047-2425	1537-2537					1979	8	4					561	566		10.2134/jeq1979.00472425000800040024x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1979.00472425000800040024x													WOS:A1979HS62300024

Daily activity rhythm, time budget and foraging pattern of wintering swans are the important presentation of behavioral strategy in response to habitat variations. We studied the behavior of Tundra Swan wintering in the wetland of Huangpi Lake from November 2012 to February 2013. Wintering individuals and water levels were surveyed every day. Instantaneous scan and focal animal sampling was conducted to collect the behavior data. Foraging behavior is the major behavior in the wintering period, followed by rest behavior and vigilance behavior. In daily activity rhythms, the trough and peaks of foraging behavior appeared in the morning (09:00-10:00 h) and evening(16:00-17:00 h), which is just contrary to the rest behavior. Foraging and rest behaviors showed highly significant differences among all the daily time intervals (P<0.01). During the winter, the foraging and vigilance behaviors declined first, and then increased, which is contrary to the rest behavior. When the water level was lower in mid January, the time budget for vigilance behavior reached the lowest, amounting to 5.19 +/- 0.88%. There were significant or highly significant differences except for foraging time budget with the variation of water level. The foraging intensity was affected by water-level fluctuations, and declined with the increase in water level. When water level is low with more available food the swans assemble into a large flock and spend more time foraging, in the meantime the vigilance value declines so as to get enough food supply. Foraging intensity is lower in deep water and higher in shallow water. The small lake could be an alternative suitable foraging habitat for the wintering Tundra Swans when facing the habitat loss.

J	Zhou, J; Zhou, LZ; Xu, WB				Zhou, Jian; Zhou, Lizhi; Xu, Wenbin			Diversity of wintering waterbirds enhanced by restoring aquatic vegetation at Shengjin Lake, China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The restoration of planted vegetation contributes towards improving the habitat quality of waterbirds and enhancing the diversity of their communities. Thus, the success of projects attempting to restore aquatic vegetation could, in part, be quantified by evaluating the community structure of wintering waterbirds. Here, we evaluated the effect of wetland restoration (through planting aquatic vegetation) by comparing waterbird communities in restored versus unrestored areas over two wintering periods (2017-2018 and 2018-2019). Specifically, the use of aquatic vegetation by waterbirds was evaluated following restoration, and was compared against three control (unrestored) areas; namely, a Euryale ferox planting area, freshwater aquaculture area, and rice planting area. Twenty-nine species belonging to eleven families of waterbirds were recorded across the four habitats. Species richness and density of waterbirds in the restored aquatic vegetation area were significantly higher than those in the three control areas. The restored aquatic vegetation area had the highest absolute value of Temporal Beta-diversity Index (TBI), while species gains (C) were significantly greater than species losses (B). Additionally, there was a significant increase in the number of wintering waterbird species from three foraging guilds in the restored aquatic vegetation area during the wintering period of 2018-2019 compared to 2017-2018 (Granivore guild; Invertivore guild; Piscivore guild). The restoration of aquatic vegetation mainly caused the number of Anatidae species to increase, including ruddy shelduck (Tadorna ferruginea), common teal (Anas crecca), common mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), spot-billed duck (Anas poecilorhyncha), and common pochard (Aythya ferina). Submerged vegetation provides clucks with important food resources, such as seeds. And emerging vegetation facilitating the concealment of waterbirds. In conclusion, the artificial promotion of aquatic vegetation restoration at Shengjin Lake has contributed towards maintaining the structure of wintering waterbird communities. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this study is to present the properties and pathogenicity of the Vibrio bacilli. The Vibrio family are pathogenic to humans causing dangerous infectious diseases that may often be fatal in the absence of effective therapy, but are also an infectious agent among animals. The most characteristic representative of the Vibrionaceae family is the species Vibrio cholerae. There are two strains that disrupt the water and electrolyte balance in humans: V. cholerae O1 and V. cholerae O139. The V. cholerae O1 serotype has two biotypes: classical and El Tor. Three serotypes are distinguished in each biotype - Inaba, Ogawa and Hikojima. The El Tor biotype shows the ability to survive and colonize the human body, causing chronic carrier state. Infections caused by species other than V. cholerae are referred to by the prefix "non" or NAG (Non-AgglutinatinG-Vibrio) - V. cholerae non-O1 and V. cholerae non-O139. They are found in natural bodies of water, lakes, estuaries and marine waters. In Poland, V. cholerae non-O1 and V. cholerae non-O139 were confirmed in previous years in the Bug River, near the border with Ukraine, during the summer -autumn period.

We sampled macroinvertebrates in Spring Peeper Pond three times from May to July 2001, and Taylor-Ochs Pond two times from May to June 2001. Macroinvertebrate distributions were significantly aggregated on all sampling dates in both ponds. Bivalve abundance in Spring Peeper Pond was higher in shallower water. The distribution of bivalves in Taylor-Ochs Pond was not correlated with any variable we measured. Dragonfly nymph abundance in Taylor-Ochs Pond decreased between the first and second sampling dates, whereas in Spring Peeper Pond no factor examined was correlated with dragonfly nymph density. Snail densities in Spring Peeper Pond were negatively related to dissolved oxygen and depth. In Taylor-Ochs Pond, snail abundance was positively related to temperature. The densities of damselfly nymphs in Spring Peeper Pond were positively related to dissolved oxygen and depth and declined across the study. In Spring Peeper Pond, hemipteran densities were negatively related to depth and increased across the study. Damselfly nymphs and hemipterans were not common enough in Taylor-Ochs to analyze. In general, the abiotic and biotic factors we examined explained relatively little (<37% in all cases) of the within pond distribution of the macroinvertebrates in our two study ponds.																			0018-8158					MAY	2003	497	1-3					161	167		10.1023/A:1025433103243	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1025433103243													WOS:000185009200013

The total (gas + particle) air concentrations of 11 OCPs ranged from 5.34 to 417 pg/m(3), of which HCHs, DDTs, chlordane and HCB concentrations ranged from 0.67 to 214 pg/m(3), 2.03 to 198 pg/m(3), 2.25 to 158 pg/m(3), and 0.38 to 77.1 pg/m(3), respectively. The total concentrations of PCBs ranged from 42.4 to 224 pg/m(3), with an average of 102 +/- 53.6 pg/m(3). Similar seasonal trends of HCH, DDT, chlordane, HCB concentrations were observed with the winter maximum. Diagnostic ratios indicate that aged technical HCH, DDT and chlordane were the major source of HCHs, DDTs and chlordane, respectively. PSCF analysis identified that northern China, southern China and Japan were major source regions of OCPs at Ningbo background site. As for PCBs, the seasonal trend was characterized with higher concentrations in summer.

Our current understanding of lake ecosystem response to climate change: What have we really learned from the north temperate deep lakes?	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Climatic change is recognized as an important factor capable of influencing the structural properties of aquatic ecosystems. Lake ecosystems are particularly sensitive to climate change. Several long time-series studies have shown close coupling between climate, lake thermal properties and individual organism physiology, population abundance, community structure, and food-web structure. Understanding the complex interplay between climate, hydrological variability, and ecosystem structure and functioning is essential to inform water resources risk assessment and fisheries management. The purpose of this paper is to present the current understanding of climate-induced changes on lake ecosystem phenology. We first review the ability of climate to modulate the interactions among lake hydrodynamics, chemical factors, and food-web structure in several north temperate deep lakes (e.g., lake Washington, Lake Tahoe, Lake Constance, Lake Geneva, Lake Baikal, and Lake Zurich). Our aim is to assess long-term trends in the physical (e.g., temperature, timing of stratification, and duration of ice cover), chemical (e.g., nutrient concentrations), and biological (e.g., timing of the spring bloom, phytoplankton composition, and zooplankton abundance) characteristics of the lakes and to examine the signature of local weather conditions (e.g., air temperature and rainfall) and large-scale climatic variability (e.g., ENSO and PDO) on the lake physics, chemistry and biology. We also conducted modeling experiments to quantify the relative effect of climate change and nutrient loading on lake phenology. These modeling experiments focused on the relative changes to the major causal associations underlying plankton dynamics during the spring bloom and the summer stratified period. To further understand the importance of climate change on lakes, we propose two complementary directions of future research. First, additional research is needed to elucidate the wide array of in-lake processes that are likely to be affected by the climate change. Second, it is essential to examine the heterogeneity in responses among different water bodies. The rationale of this approach and its significance for dealing with the uncertainty that the climate signals cascade through lake ecosystems and shape abiotic variability and/or biotic responses have been recently advocated by several other synthesis papers.

Diet and reproduction of largemouth bass in a recently introduced population, Lake Bracciano (Central Italy)	BFPP-CONNAISSANCE ET GESTION DU PATRIMOINE AQUATIQUE												This paper concerns a study of some aspects of largemouth bass ecology in an Italian lake (Lake Bracciano). We assessed the success and possible impact of its recent introduction (1998) upon the fish community. From October 2001 to September 2002, 162 individuals were caught, measured, aged and submitted to biopsy (stomach and gonads were removed). Four age classes, from 0 + to 3 +, were observed in the population. Largemouth bass feeding activity was high in June, mostly eating fish (55.7%), crustaceans (in particular Palaemonetes antennarius, 37.5%), insects (4.5%) and molluscs (2.3%). The G.S.I. values showed an autumnal breeding period (from December to February) rather than the spring-summer one frequently described in North America. Moreover, bass attained sexual maturity during the second year of life (1+). These differences could be related to its recent introduction and the apparent success could represent a problem for other species in the Lake.

Investigating the living conditions of the late Miocene hominoids is therefore crucial for a better understanding of how they survived in those refugia. In this study, we present relevant palaeobotanical evidence regarding the habitat, climate and possible plant food resources for the Shuitangba hominoid (Lufengpithecus cf. lufengensis) from the late Miocene Zhaotong Basin, Southwest China. A total of 14 plant taxa were recognized from carpological remains newly recovered from the Zhaotong Basin, among which ten taxa were not reflected in the previous pollen record. These new plant taxa expand our knowledge of the flora and indicate how diverse the ecosystem in the late Miocene Zhaotong Basin was. Based on our carpological taxa, we hypothesize that the Shuitangba hominoid lived in a stratified mixed forest composed of trees, shrubs, lianas, herbs and grasses, near a lake occupied by various aquatic plants. The quantitative palaeoclimate reconstruction using the Coexistence Approach (CoA) indicates that the late Miocene Zhaotong Basin had a mean annual temperature (MAT) of 11.317.6 C and a mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 1042-1547 mm, suggesting a mildly warm and humid climate for the Shuitangba hominoid. It also indicates that the hominoid had warm and wet summers but cool and dry winters, under the influence of the Asian monsoon. Edible and nutritious fruits and seeds of a considerable size, e.g., nuts of Carya and Corylus, fruits of Euryale and Trapa, were possibly exploited by the Shuitangba hominoid. The harder fruits, e.g., nuts of Carya and Corylus, might have benefited the hominoid as a fallback resource in winter when foods were scarce. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lin, J; Li, J				Lin, Jing; Li, Jie			Nutrient Response Modeling in Falls of the Neuse Reservoir	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												In order to study system responses of Falls of the Neuse Reservoir (Falls Lake) to varied nutrient loadings, a coupled three-dimensional hydrodynamic and eutrophication model was applied. The model was calibrated using 2005 and 2006 intensive survey data, and validated using 2007 survey data. Compared with historical hydrological records, 2005 and 2007 were considered as dry years and 2006 was recognized as a normal year. Relatively higher nutrient fluxes from the sediment were specified for dry year model simulations. The differences were probably due to longer residence time and hence higher nutrient retention rate during dry years in Falls Lake. During the normal year of 2006, approximately 70% of total nitrogen (TN) and 80% of total phosphorus (TP) were delivered from the tributaries; about 20% (TN and TP) were from the sediment bottom. During the dry years of 2005 and 2007, the amount of TN released from sediment was equivalent to that introduced from the tributaries, indicating the critical role of nutrient recycling within the system in dry years. The model results also suggest that both nitrogen and phosphorus are limiting phytoplankton growth in Falls Lake. In the upper part of the lake where high turbidity was observed, nitrogen limitation appeared to dominate. Scenario model runs also suggest that great nutrient loading reductions are needed for Falls Lake to meet the water quality standard.																			0364-152X	1432-1009				MAR	2011	47	3					398	409		10.1007/s00267-011-9617-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-011-9617-4								21308376					WOS:000288257100007
J	Kishcha, P; Lechinsky, Y; Starobinets, B				Kishcha, Pavel; Lechinsky, Yury; Starobinets, Boris			Cooling by Cyprus Lows of Surface and Epilimnion Water in Subtropical Lake Kinneret in Rainy Seasons	REMOTE SENSING												Comparison between high-precipitation (HP) years and low-precipitation (LP) years led to our main findings which are as follows: Cyprus lows are instrumental in the cooling of surface and epilimnion water in subtropical Lake Kinneret and in the cooling of eastern Mediterranean surface water. Cyprus lows are responsible for cold weather, rainfall, and for an increase in cloudiness causing a decrease in solar radiation over the eastern Mediterranean and north Israel (including Lake Kinneret). In the daytime, comparison between HP and LP years of Kinneret surface water temperature (SWT) and epilimnion water temperature (WT) showed water cooling of up to 2 degrees C in HP years. This study was carried out using the 21-year period of satellite and in-situ data: (1) MODIS 1 km x 1 km resolution records of SWT, in (2) shipboard measurements of WT vertical profiles down to a depth of similar to 40 m (2000-2020). We found that a decrease in solar radiation caused by Cyprus lows (due to an increase in cloudiness) was the main factor contributing to Kinneret water cooling. In winter (December-January) when solar radiation (SR) was minimal, no water cooling was observed: the WT difference between HP and LP years was insignificant. However, in spring (March-April) when SR increased and became the main factor contributing to water heating, water cooling was observed: SWT and epilimnion WT, averaged over the HP years, was lower by similar to 2 degrees C and similar to 1.4 degrees C, respectively, than SWT and epilimnion WT, averaged over the LP years. Not only was water cooling observed in Lake Kinneret, but also in eastern Mediterranean surface water. Comparison of SWT over the eastern Mediterranean between the same HP and LP years in spring showed SWT cooling by similar to 1.2 degrees C. This is evidence of the regional character of the daytime water-cooling phenomenon caused by Cyprus lows.

Deeper snow keeps the arctic soils warmer and alters soil attributes and vegetation, e.g., increase in nitrogen availability, expansion of shrubs and decline in shade-intolerant lichens and bryophytes. Changes in soil properties and vegetation are expected to influence on saprotrophic and plant-symbiotic fungi, but how increased snow depth affects their community composition remain unknown. In the present work, we used DNA meta-barcoding to study the effects of long-term experimental manipulations of snow depth on soil fungal communities in dry heath and moist tussock tundra in Arctic Alaska. We report strong changes in fungal community compositions in the two tundra types, with pronounced declines observed in the majority of fungal. functional guilds, including ectomycorrhizal, lichenized, plant pathogenic, saprotrophic and bryophyte-associated species. The observed changes in lichenized and bryophyte-associated fungi are in agreement with previously published above-ground changes, i.e. decrease of lichen and bryophyte cover and diversity. However, the majority of observed trends, including the decline of ectomycorrhizal fungi (that were anticipated to benefit from the expansion of their host plants), suggest that changes in fungal communities do not entirely correspond to and are not primarily driven by shifts in vegetation. Instead, arctic fungal communities appear to exhibit faster turnover that may be influenced by dynamic interactions with numerous biotic and abiotic factors, e.g., soil nutrient cycling and community dynamics in other groups of soil microorganisms. We highlight the importance of "below-ground studies" in assessing ecosystem responses to climatic changes, because faster turnover of microbial communities may be applicable for monitoring early-stage alterations caused by climatic changes.

Study focus: The focus of this study is to understand the climatic influence on precipitation isotopic composition and the mechanism underlying the seasonal isotope variation of precipitation in the Poyang Lake Wetland. New hydrological insights for the region: The Local Meteoric Water Line was established as delta H-2 = (8.83 +/- 0.18) x delta O-18 + (12.77 +/- 0.86) (R-2 = 0.93, p < 0.01, n = 186). A total of seven moisture sub-sources contributing to precipitation were identified using the HYSPLIT model, among which distinct differences in isotopic signatures were revealed. The seasonal isotopic variation of precipitation in the study area was found not to respond to local meteorological factors. An increase in the relative occurrence frequency and relative contribution to precipitation of the continental source was found from summer to winter, which explains the seasonal variation in precipitation delta O-18 and d-excess. Combining the results of back trajectory analysis and isotopic statistics for the sub-source classification, the seasonal evolution of precipitation isotopes is considered to be caused by variations in the contribution from various moisture sources with distinct isotopic characteristics, which are further controlled by monsoon activities. This study highlights the importance of regional-scale moisture source dynamics and atmospheric circulation for the seasonal isotope variation of precipitation in the Poyang Lake Wetland.

The urban areas had higher air PBDEs than the rural areas because of endogenic pollution. The highest and lowest concentrations of Sigma 13BDEs were observed in the winter and in the summer, respectively. A weak temperature dependence and significant positive correlations between certain PBDE congeners and the PM10 (P < 0.01) suggest transport with particulate matter. Using air-mass back-trajectories, we determined that the main sources of the PBDEs were the areas to the north, such as Shandong Province, and to the east, such as Zhejiang Province. PBDEs did not pose an appreciable risk to human health based on the inhalation exposure assessment. The residents in urban areas were exposed to higher levels of PBDEs, and wintertime exposures posed the greatest human health risk. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Isard, SA; Schaetzl, RJ				Isard, SA; Schaetzl, RJ			Effects of winter weather conditions on soil freezing in southern Michigan	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												We examined climatic and (modelled) soil-temperature data from five winters in southern Michigan to ascertain the spatial variability in soil-freezing and freeze-thaw cycles at 5 cm. The five winters chosen for study (1951-1952, 1952-1953, 1953-1954, 1976-1977, and 1979-1980) represent the extremes of weather (e.g., cold and snowy, warm and dry) for the 1951-1980 period. We chose this study area because it lies on an ecotone between the cold, snowy climates of southern Canada and the warmer climates of the Ohio Valley where persistent snowpacks are rare, and because virtually no data on soil freezing exist for this area. Soil freezing in winter in southern Michigan is more dependent on snowpack persistence and thickness, especially in mid-winter, than on air temperatures. Here, even in warm winters, soils freeze to 5 cm, provided that snowpacks are thin or absent. Conversely, in even the coldest winters, soils rarely freeze where deep snows accumulate. Thus, freezing is least frequent, and in some years nonexistent, in the lake-effect snowbelt region, where deep, reliable snowpacks insulate the soil. Conversely, soil-freezing and freeze-thaw activity are most common in dry winters, almost regardless of temperature. On average, less than two freeze-thaw cycles a year can be expected in the snowbelt region; 3 to 5 cycles a year are typical in eastern and southeastern southern Michigan. Soil freezing is likely to increase in Michigan's lower peninsula, under a doubled-CO2 climate that is warmer and drier.																			0272-3646					JAN-FEB	1998	19	1					71	94		10.1080/02723646.1998.10642641	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02723646.1998.10642641													WOS:000076539600005

Excision of Marechal Foch buds to enclude any of the stem tissue raised the LTE temperature above that obtained with the bud attached to a piece of the stem. Cooling rates between 1.5 and 10% C h-1 did not affect the LTE temperature of Marechal Foch and Okanagan Riesling buds, but at the most rapid rate of cooling, 40.degree. C h-1, a lack of thermal contact between the sensor and the tissue produced an error in measurement. The LTE temperature determined on the buds of eight cultivars was within 0.9.degree. C of the temperature which killed 50% of the buds. Peconditioning the buds at -5.degree. C for 7 d and then -10.degree. C for 3 d improved the ability of thermal analysis to discriminate the differences in freezing resistance among the cultivars Marechal Foch, Okanagan Riesling and Lakemont, in the autumn; but not in mid-winter.

J	Loehr, J; Sundell, J; Immonen, M; Väinölä, R				Loehr, John; Sundell, Janne; Immonen, Mikko; Vainola, Risto			Patterns in antipredator armature reduction and maintenance in isolated spring populations of an amphipod crustacean	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Organisms colonizing new habitats can undergo adaptive change due to novel selective landscapes encountered in the new environment. Examples in nature where the development of the same traits has repeatedly occurred on multiple independent occasions upon colonizing a novel habitat represent instances of parallel evolution. Here we test whether the colonization of spring habitat by the principally lacustrine amphipod crustacean Pallaseopsis quadrispinosa has resulted in parallel evolution in armature traits using empirical data on morphology and mitochondrial DNA and through a breeding experiment. Analysis of mtDNA CO1 sequences shows that the spring populations share no common history and have evolved in isolation from each other and from their neighbouring lake populations since deglaciation approximately 12,000 years ago and are now fixed for different haplogroups. Dorsal spines and lateral projections were absent or less developed in all spring populations than in lake populations. Variation in armature development also could be explained by predator presence as populations with fish predators exhibited more developed spines than those without fish. In a laboratory breeding experiment, hybrid Spring x Lake F1 offspring had intermediate development of armature compared to offspring of Lake x Lake and Spring x Spring matings. The results support the hypothesis that armature reduction has independently evolved on multiple occasions in P. quadrispinosa. Recent research has questioned the degree to which parallel evolution actually explains variance in traits. Taking into account the predation regime, sexual dimorphism and mineral composition of the trait, a more precise understanding of the factors influencing parallel evolution emerges.

Due to their hemispheric positions, the dry (wet) Australian winter (summer) monsoon coincides with the wet summer Asian monsoon and vice versa. The Australian monsoon controls rainfall distribution in northern tropical Australia where over 80% of the median annular rainfall occurs from December to March, the summer wet season. Three types of the Australian monsoon are distinguished based on distinct atmospheric circulation and heating patterns: a northwest Pseudo-Monsoon, a northeast Quasi-Monsoon and an Australian Monsoon (sensu stricto) north of Australia. While the modern climatology of the Australian monsoon has been extensively documented, its paleohistory is poorly constrained, especially in Australia's continental interior where harsh arid climatic conditions have degraded almost all physical evidence of monsoonal activity. However, reassessment of northern and central Australian terrestrial and marine sequences reveals a fairly robust Cenozoic history of this monsoon, especially for the Neogene, which we synthesize for the first time here. Evidence for a Paleogene Australian paleomonsoon is equivocal due to the small number of sites, their limited age control, and the poor preservation of flora with ambiguous affinities. Modeling and tectonic evidence suggest the northern part of the Australian Plate migrated to the (sub)tropical region (north of 30 degrees S) creating "modern" boundary conditions for monsoonal onset by similar to 10 Ma. Cores off northwest Australia reveal arid late Miocene and humid Pliocene conditions were followed by the Pseudo-Monsoon at similar to 3.5 Ma when northern hemisphere glacial expansion "forced" the ITCZ (Inter Tropical Convergent Zone) south. Subsequently, variable humid and arid periods typify Quaternary high-amplitude glacio-eustatic cycles until similar to 1 Ma, when arid conditions expanded across Australia. Glacial/interglacial cyclicity and obliquity/precession insolation during terminations modulated Pseudo-Monsoon intensity when the ITCZ migrated northward (during glacial) and southward (during interglacial periods) from similar to 1 Ma to present. From similar to 1.6 to 1 Ma, precession paced Pseudo-Monsoon variability. Mega-lake expansion in central Australia and fluvial intensification generally correspond to wetter interglacial periods. Lake Eyre monsoonal shorelines may have been influenced by abrupt millennial events. Monsoonal conditions re-established near the base of Holocene as the ITCZ migrated across northern Australia. The Australian Monsoon (sensu stricto) and Quasi-Monsoon (a) initiated from 12.5 to 11 ka; (b) intensifying from 9 to 2 ka; then (c) weakened, possibly due to the onset of ENSO intensification. The Pseudo-Monsoon was established at similar to 14.5 ka off northwest Australia intensifying from 11.5 to 7 ka. It weakened after similar to 7 ka north of 15 degrees S and similar to 5 ka to the south. In the absence of a topographic influence, insolation (precession/obliquity), abrupt millennial events and/or ITCZ variability across northern Australia were important controls on Quaternary Australian monsoon intensity. Further investigations of deeper time pre-Quaternary records off northwest and northeast Australia will reveal the paleohistory of this important domain of the Global Monsoon.

The concentration of vitamin B12 in the lake water decreased by 60% from late winter to summer, while the rate of uptake increased 16-fold and turnover time decreased from 50 days to 1 day. The uptake process could be described by the Michaelis-Menten equation. Regression analyses suggested that the standing crops of blue-green algae and detritus were most important in affecting the concentration of vitamin B12, but that the standing crops of diatoms and "other" algae affected the rate of uptake most. A hypothesis formulated to explain the necessary coincident variation in rates of vitamin B12 input and output assumes indirect coupling, via detritus, between algal utilization and bacterial production of vitamin B12; it was tested against data from this and other studies.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1977	22	3					527	538		10.4319/lo.1977.22.3.0527	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1977.22.3.0527													WOS:A1977DH78500013

Four dominant diatoms were examined: Cyclotella glomerata, Cyclotella ocellata, Synedra amphicephala, and Synedra radians. The role of interspecific resource-based competition during spring and summer was tested in three ways: (1) species distribution patterns along the vertical gradient (upper 100m of the water column), (2) measurements of in situ growth and loss (sinking, grazing, natural death, diffusion) processes, and (3) transplants of assemblages between depths. All three tests indicated that resource-based competition was important. Species clearly segregated with thermal stratification and nutrient depletion in the epilimnion. C. glomerata peaked within the epilimnion (0-20 m), S. radians became dominant in the deep chlorophyll maximum region (60-90 m), and the other species peaked at intermediate depths. Resource-limited growth was a dominant process during this time, and sinking and natural death were significant losses. Experimental transplants of assemblages between two depths (15 and 75 m) demonstrated competitive interactions in the phosphate-limited region near the surface, but there was no evidence of competition in the deeper light-limited region. This suggested asymmetrical competition along the vertical gradient. Primary productivity nutrient-enrichment bioassays and growth kinetic assays (phosphate, nitrate, light) also indicated that phosphate and light limitation were important bases of species interactions.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				JUN	1988	69	3					664	678		10.2307/1941015	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1941015													WOS:A1988N720900013
J	Smith, SA; Menges, ES				Smith, Stacy A.; Menges, Eric S.			Population Dynamics and Life History of Euphorbia rosescens, a Perennial Herb Endemic to Florida Scrub	PLOS ONE												Euphorbia rosescens is a recently described plant that is narrowly endemic to the Lake Wales Ridge. Little is known of the ecology or life history of this diminutive, deeply rooted polygamodioecious perennial. We studied 13 subpopulations of this species from 20042012 from five habitats, sampling monthly during its growing season. Subpopulations were stable year-to-year with annual survivals > 90%, but with considerable within-year dynamics, peaking in density in April and dying back in the fall and winter. Stem densities did not vary among subpopulations, habitats, or by subpopulation gender. Annual plant dormancy was common and decreased subsequent survival. Belowground biomass averaged almost 50 times higher than aboveground biomass. Subpopulations either consisted of entirely female individuals or a mixture of male and functionally andromonoecious individuals and these subpopulation genders remained stable across years. Overall, flowering has been dominated by female plants. Plants produced modest numbers of inflorescences (cyathia), and fruit production was very low. Although most plants survived fire by resprouting, fire decreased survival and had a short-term positive effect on floral production. Lack of fecundity and recruitment are concerns for this state-endangered species, but more information is needed on its breeding system and clonality to make specific management recommendations.

Recent shallowing of the thaw depth at Crater Lake, Deception Island, Antarctica (2006-2014)	CATENA												The Western Antarctic Peninsula region is one of the hot spots of climate change and one of the most ecologically sensitive regions of Antarctica, where permafrost is near its climatic limits. The research was conducted in Deception Island, an active stratovolcano in the South Shetlands archipelago off the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. The climate is polar oceanic, with high precipitation and mean annual air temperatures (MAAT) close to -3 degrees C. The soils are composed by ashes and pyroclasts with high porosity and high water content, with ice rich permafrost at -0.8 degrees C at the depth of zero annual amplitude, with an active layer of about 30 cm. Results from thaw depth, ground temperature and snow cover monitoring at the Crater Lake CALM-S site over the period 2006 to 2014 are analyzed. Thaw depth (TD) was measured by mechanical probing once per year in the end of January or early February in a 100 x 100 m with a 10 m spacing grid. The results show a trend for decreasing thaw depth from ci. 36 cm in 2006 to 23 cm in 2014, while MAAT, as well as ground temperatures at the base of the active layer, remained stable. However, the duration of the snow cover at the CALM-S site, measured through the Snow Pack Factor (SF) showed an increase from 2006 to 2014, especially with longer lasting snow cover in the spring and early summer. The negative correlation between SF and the thaw depth supports the significance of the influence of the increasing snow cover in thaw depth, even with no trend in the MAAT. The lack of observed ground cooling in the base of the active layer is probably linked to the high ice/water content at the transient layer. The pyroclastic soils of Deception Island, with high porosity, are key to the shallow active layer depths, when compared to other sites in the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). These findings support the lack of linearity between atmospheric warming and permafrost warming and induce an extra complexity to the understanding of the effects of climate change in the ice-free areas of the WAP, especially in scenarios with increased precipitation as snow fall.

The aim of this study was therefore to systematically apply the various recommended storage protocols to a range of natural water matrices. Samples from four contrasting sites in the UK, collected in late winter (February, 1999), were filtered and stored under different conditions (-80 degreesC, -20 degreesC, 4 degreesC and at 4 degreesC and -20 degreesC with 0.1% (v/v) chloroform) for up to 247 days prior to analysis. The sites were the River Frome in Dorset (a chalk stream catchment) and three sites from the Tamar Estuary (draining a non-chalk catchment) with salinities of 0.5 parts per thousand, 10 parts per thousand and 34 parts per thousand. Samples and controls were analysed for total oxidised nitrogen (TON) and filterable reactive phosphorus (FRP) using a segmented flow analyser with spectrophotometric detection, To investigate possible seasonal effects (particularly changes in biological and chemical matrix composition), a second sampling campaign was undertaken in early autumn (October, 1999). The results showed that the optimum storage conditions for the determination of TON and FRP were highly matrix dependent, with significant differences in FRP stability between the Frome and Tamar catchments (due to different calcium concentrations) and between samples of different salinities (due to different bacterial populations and/or dissolved organic matter). General guidelines for sample handling and storage are listed and matrix specific recommendations presented for samples rich in calcium and dissolved organic matter. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The downward advection of trophogenic waters was found to create conditions for the extensive growth of microorganisms capable of decomposing and mineralizing organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in deep water layers. These processes occur annually at spring thermal bars near the underwater slope of Lake Baikal, whereas in its pelagic zone. the deep intrusions of waters rich in organic material are observed only in the years when enhanced deep-water renewal is accompanied by a high spring yield of phytoplankton.

[USA]). However, survivorship of the two species is similar in the low salinity water of S. pexa''s habitat (Grizzly Springs, Lake County, Calif., 15 km from Wilbur Hot Springs). Tests with glycine-radiolabeled water indicate that S. usingeri imbibes fluids from its prey, larvae of the brine fly Paracoenia calida Mathis, rather than imbibing water from its habitat; in contrast, S. pexa imbibes water from its own habitat, and Wilbur Hot Springs water as well. By imbibing fluids from its prey, S. usingeri expends less energy for osmoregulation and its intake of toxic ions from Wilbur Hot Springs water is reduced. By imbibing Wilbur Hot Springs water, the potentially coexisting S. pexa lacks these advantages. Although abiotic differences may explain S. pexa''s absence from S. usingeri''s habitats, susceptibility of S. usingeri to spider predation may explain the absence of S. usingeri from S. pex''s habitats. Predatory spiders are virtually absent from S. usingeri''s habitats but are very abundant in S. pexa''s habitats. In laboratory tests, the wolf spider Pardosa ramulosa McCook (Araneae: Lycosidae) killed 8-fold as many of the sluggish S. usingeri adults as the skittish S. pexa adults. Sluggishness may be an advantage when S. usingeri occurs along margins of lethal thermal effluents (as at Wilbur Hot Springs) but it may be a disadvantage in nonthermal habitats with mobile predators.																			0046-225X	1938-2936				OCT	1987	16	5					1087	1091		10.1093/ee/16.5.1087	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/16.5.1087													WOS:A1987L221200011

Effects of an Advisory Brochure on Fish Consumption of Urban Anglers in the Great Lakes Region	RISK ANALYSIS												Past research has suggested that urban anglers are a group at high risk of being exposed to contaminants from fish consumption. Fish consumption advisories have been used in many regions to encourage healthy fish-eating behaviors, but few studies have been designed to assess whether these advisories actually influence behavior as intended. We conducted a large-scale, randomized experiment to test the influence of an advisory brochure on urban anglers' fish consumption. We collected detailed information on anglers' fish consumption in three urban counties in the Great Lakes region in the summers of 2014 and 2015. We provided a treatment group with fish consumption guidelines in an advisory brochure before the summer of 2015 and compared their change in fish consumption to a control group. The brochure led to a reduction in fish consumption for anglers who ate the most fish; these anglers reduced their consumption of high-contaminant purchased fish (by 0.2 meals/summer for those in 72nd percentile of fish consumption or above), high-contaminant sport-caught fish (by 0.4 meals/summer for those in 87th percentile and above), and low-contaminant sport-caught fish (by 0.3 meals/summer by those in 76th percentile and above). The brochure also reduced sport-caught fish consumption among those anglers who exceeded the advisories in 2014 (by 2.0 meals/summer). In addition, the brochure led to small increases in sport-caught fish consumption (0.4-0.6 meals/summer) in urban anglers who ate very little sport-caught fish (1 meal/summer).																			0272-4332	1539-6924				JUL	2018	38	7					1405	1421		10.1111/risa.12953	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/risa.12953								29266340					WOS:000438363300008

The population structure, age and growth of Luciobarbus callensis (Cyprinidae) in a man-made lake in the Maghreb (NE Algeria)	LIMNETICA												Knowledge of the biological traits of native fishes distributed throughout the Maghreb, e.g., Luciobarbus callensis, the target species of this study, is essential for assessing the status of these species and for improving their conservation. In this study, the age and growth characteristics of a population in a man-made lake showing temporal variations in ecological conditions and managed for agricultural purposes were investigated. The sampled population showed a wide range of ages and an age structure dominated by middle-aged cohorts (4+-7+). Compared with stream populations, the studied stock was characterised by a large number of age groups. The annual growth of middle-aged fish was not great and decreased with longevity. The growth pattern was seasonal, consisting of a single growth period extending from the end of winter to spring, immediately prior to the reproductive period. Relative abundance showed slight differences between seasons. The highest values of somatic condition occurred immediately following the reproductive period. Most likely, the characteristics of the species were affected by the ecological variation of the reservoir and by the highly variable stream flowing into the reservoir. However, Luciobarbus callensis showed a high adaptability to these artificial systems.

The results showed the water in the region of the thermocline became supersaturated markedly as a consequence of warming during the spring and summer. The excess gas was below the extent of surface mixing and was held in solution by the hydrostatic pressure. In mid-July at a depth of 30 ft., O2 was 126% and N 116% of air saturation. By mid-Sept. at a depth of 50 ft., O2 saturation was 94% and N 110% of air saturation. O2 was liberated by photosynthesis in the epilimnion and upper portion of the thermocline, and consumed in the lower part of the thermocline and the upper hypolimhion. Thus N supersaturation could not be diagnosed by measurement of dissolved 02 alone. N supersaturation is discussed in relation to the use of lake water for hatchery culture of fish.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1967	96	2					194	+		10.1577/1548-8659(1967)96[194:SOLWWA]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1967)96[194:SOLWWA]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A19679678800012

The model, known as the Lake Michigan Eutrophication model (LM3-Eutro), has a high-resolution computational grid that enables good spatial description of spring temperature and phytoplankton concentrations, which have significant gradients in the lakes. The grid also allows the model to predict concentrations in nearshore areas and other regions of interest. The model provided more accurate estimates of algal light limitation based on three-hour intervals compared to daily averages that are used in most eutrophication models, especially during sunny summer days when algal photo-inhibition often occurs. Model output was compared to field data using statistical parameters such as squares of the correlation coefficients to determine the best model fit. The calibrated model output fit the field data reasonably well for nutrients and phytoplankton, which provided confidence in the framework, governing equations, and coefficients used. Water Environ.

The percentage of wind stable aggregates > 0.84 mm dia is greatest in panne areas, showing substantial increases in early spring. Considerable diversity of photoautotrophs is found in these moist, low lying areas with cyanobacteria, chlorophytes and diatoms present in an active state. Virtually no aggregation is observed in sediments from either the dune ridges or portions of the beach surface which are raked on a daily basis to remove detritus. These disturbed beach surfaces are mobilized by strong autumn winds. Although chlorophytes and cyanobacteria were cultured in the dune sediments, low chlorophyll a concentrations suggest that these microorganisms were not actively growing. In comparison, aggregation is evident in natural, undisturbed beach sediments, especially in midsummer. This increase is positively correlated with chlorophyll a concentration and number of genera. An exponential relationship is observed between chlorophyll a concentration and the percentage of aggregates (> 0.84 mm) in panne and natural beach samples. These aggregates contribute to the stability of these areas to wind transport.																			0038-0717	1879-3428				FEB	1994	26	2					221	233		10.1016/0038-0717(94)90162-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0038-0717(94)90162-7													WOS:A1994NA22100005

Annual cycle of White-winged Scoters (Melanitta fusca) in eastern North America: migratory phenology, population delineation, and connectivity	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Understanding full annual cycle movements of long-distance migrants is essential for delineating populations, assessing connectivity, evaluating crossover effects between life stages, and informing management strategies for vulnerable or declining species. We used implanted satellite transmitters to track up to 2 years of annual cycle movements of 52 adult female White-winged Scoters (Melanitta fusca (Linnaeus, 1758)) captured in the eastern United States and Canada. We used these data to document annual cycle phenology; delineate migration routes; identify primary areas used during winter, stopover, breeding, and molt; and assess the strength of migratory connectivity and spatial population structure. Most White-winged Scoters wintered along the Atlantic coast from Nova Scotia to southern New England, with some on Lake Ontario. White-winged Scoters followed four migration routes to breeding areas from Quebec to the Northwest Territories. Principal postbreeding molting areas were in James Bay and the St. Lawrence River estuary. Migration phenology was synchronous regardless of winter or breeding origin. Cluster analyses delineated two primary breeding areas: one molting area and one wintering area. White-winged Scoters demonstrated overall weak to moderate connectivity among life stages, with molting to wintering connectivity the strongest. Thus, White-winged Scoters that winter in eastern North America appear to constitute a single continuous population.

J	Rodrigo, MA; Miracle, MR; Vicente, E				Rodrigo, MA; Miracle, MR; Vicente, E			The meromictic Lake La Cruz (Central Spain). Patterns of stratification	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The main limnological characteristics of the biogenic meromictic Lake La Cruz, a small karstic take located on a dolomitic substrate. are outlined below. The lake owes its chemical stratification mainly to high concentrations of bicarbonate and calcium in the permanent monimolimnion, located below a depth of 19 m. A massive precipitation of CaCO3 crystals ("whiting"), occurring in the euphotic zone every summer. leads to further sedimentation and redissolution in deep waters with enhanced CO2 concentrations. Other ions, like magnesium, ammonium, reduced iron. silicate, etc. also contribute to the chemically-induced stability of the monimolimnion. The patterns of stratification during two consecutive thermal stagnation periods (1987-1988) were influenced by different climatological conditions. Depending of the year, the location of the pycnoclines varied; the rainier spring of 1988 favoured a much shallower location of the oxic-anoxic boundary and a much higher primary production reflected by larger oxygen peaks. This greater phytoplanktonic development in upper waters occasioned a shadowing effect on purple and green phototrophic bacterial populations growing in anoxic waters poor in sulphide.

Rio Tercero reservoir (Argentina) is affected by various human activities that impact negatively on the system. When generating a monitoring program of aquatic systems, one of the most important considerations is to define the most significant variables. Multivariate analysis was presented as an alternative tool. The aim of this study was to determine water quality and trophic status in Rio Tercero reservoir, in order to generate an adequate basis for management of water resources. Sampling campaigns were conducted during the years 2003 to 2006. Water quality parameters were measured. We determined the trophic status of the reservoir. Multivariate analysis was performed, generating a correlation matrix and a principal component analysis (PCA). The reservoir experienced a deterioration in water quality, from mesotrophic to eutrophic state. It was shown that there is positive correlation between chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus (r = 0.83), dissolved oxygen (r = 0.51) and temperature (r = 0.43). The PCA explained the 65.6% of the total variability of the data. Multivariate analysis established that the most significant variables were chlorophyll-a, total phosphorus and temperature, demonstrating that algal blooms should occur in spring and summer seasons. The results obtained allow to generate a preliminary program of monitoring and management applied to other aquatic resources.

Increased anoxia following species invasion of a eutrophic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												Species invasions can disrupt aquatic ecosystems by re-wiring food webs. A trophic cascade triggered by the invasion of the predatory zooplankter spiny water flea (Bythotrephes cederstromii) resulted in increased phytoplankton due to decreased zooplankton grazing. Here, we show that increased phytoplankton biomass led to an increase in lake anoxia. The temporal and spatial extent of anoxia experienced a step change increase coincident with the invasion, and anoxic factor increased by 11 d. Post-invasion, anoxia established more quickly following spring stratification, driven by an increase in phytoplankton biomass. A shift in spring phytoplankton phenology encompassed both abundance and community composition. Diatoms (Bacillaryophyta) drove the increase in spring phytoplankton biomass, but not all phytoplankton community members increased, shifting the community composition. We infer that increased phytoplankton biomass increased labile organic matter and drove hypolimnetic oxygen consumption. These results demonstrate how a species invasion can shift lake phenology and biogeochemistry.

Different methods were used to measure Mn(II) fluxes from the sediments throughout the year: (1) estimates based on changes in porewater profiles, (2) direct measurements with in situ flux chambers, (3) concentration gradients into the sediment-water interface in laboratory-incubated cores, and (4) changes in hypolimnetic manganese inventories during stratification. In deep basins of the lake, high rates of Mn(IV) reduction, up to 2.1 mmol.m2.d-1, were observed during the summer and early fall, with little reduction taking place during the rest of the year. In the shallow areas of the lake, where ferromanganese nodules and crusts are commonly found, there was little or no reduction throughout the year. The manganese cycle is tightly coupled to the carbon cycle, based on our findings, and has a significant role in the oxidation of organic carbon in the lake, derived from the high photosynthetic production and the biomass that collapses and reaches the sediment-water interface. Preliminary experiments with poisoned controls suggest that Mn(IV) reduction is the result of a combination of biological and abiological processes.

Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is utilised by photosynthetic organisms and dissolved oxygen (DO) is used by heterotrophic organisms during respiration. Thus the spatial heterogeneity in the pelagic metabolic balance in Loch Lomond, Scotland was investigated using a combined natural abundance isotope technique. The isotopic signatures of dissolved inorganic carbon (delta C-13(DIC)) and dissolved oxygen (delta O-18(DO)) were measured concurrently on four different dates between November 2004 and September 2005. We measured isotopic variation over small and large spatial scales, both horizontal distance and depth. delta C-13(DIC) and delta O-18(DO) changed over a seasonal cycle, becoming concurrently more positive (negative) in the summer (winter) months, responding to increased photosynthetic and respiratory rates, respectively. With increasing depth, delta C-13(DIC) became more negative and delta O-18(DO) more positive, reflecting the shift to a respiration-dominated system. The horizontal distribution of delta C-13(DIC) and delta O-18(DO) in the epilimnion was heterogeneous. In general, the south basin had the most positive delta C-13(DIC), becoming more negative with increasing latitude, except in winter when the opposite pattern was observed. Areas of local variation were often observed near inflows. Clearly delta C-13(DIC) and delta O-18(DO) can show large spatial heterogeneity, as a result of varying metabolic balance coupled with inflow proximity and thus single point sampling to extrapolate whole lake metabolic patterns can result in error when modelling large lake systems Whilst we advise caution when using single point representation, we also show that this combined isotopic approach has potential to assist in constructing detailed lake carbon models.

Response of phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in six reservoirs of the middle Missouri River (USA) to drought conditions and a major flood event	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We assessed if the qualitative and quantitative aspects of plankton composition in reservoirs of the middle Missouri River were influenced by hydrologic variability. Phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in six reservoirs of this highly regulated system were sampled between 2004 and 2011 during historic drought, subsequent recovery, and a 100-year flood event. The reservoir system encompasses a broad latitudinal gradient of decreasing depth, decreasing water residence time and increasing trophic state. Phytoplankton communities of the upper three reservoirs were co-dominated by planktonic and meroplanktonic diatoms during the drought, recovery, and flood periods, but the proportion of more silicified meroplanktonic diatoms increased in the lower three reservoirs as water residence time decreased. Peak phytoplankton biovolume usually occurred during spring/early summer and was associated with increased hydrologic inflows and outflows. Zooplankton biomass of the reservoir system was dominated by Daphnia spp., but all zooplankton groups decreased as inflows and outflows accelerated during the recovery and flood periods. Rotifer abundances were higher under turbulent conditions associated with dam operations. Canonical correlation analyses suggested that temperature, water residence time, station depth, and water clarity explained more variance in the structures of phytoplankton and zooplankton communities than bioavailable nutrient parameters.

The dynamic of input of particulate phosphorus (pP) was identical to the dynamic of input of dissolved phosphorus (dP), and both were linked to the relative importance of inflow. The inputs in pP were twice as much as the input of dP (9.2 vs 4.2 t year(-1)). Half of dP and two-thirds of pP remained within the reservoir. During the same period, the amount of phosphorus accumulated in the sediment was estimated at 5.6 t, whereas the mass balance between inflow and outflow suggested that 6.6 t of phosphorus was stored in the reservoir. The input of phosphorus to the reservoir depends on the hydrological cycle (floods during winter and spring) while the storage of the phosphorus by sedimentation is according to the biological cycles (algal blooms).																			0144-7815		978-1-901502-88-6				2007	310						148	+																WOS:000248572500015

J	EDWARDS, J				EDWARDS, J			DIET SHIFTS IN MOOSE DUE TO PREDATOR AVOIDANCE	OECOLOGIA												On Isle Royale, Michigan [USA], moose cows which have calves show a different distribution and diet from solitary adults and yearling moose. Solitary adults and yearlings follow a feeding pattern predicted from the location of high nutrient plant growth. In the presence of wolves, they feed on the ridges of the main island, where they take advantage of plants that leaf early; only later in the season do they move to the small outlying islands where plant phenology is delayed by the cold water of Lake Superior. Cows with calves deviate sharply from this pattern. They remain on the wolf-free small islands throughout the growing season. While on the islands, cows with calves eat a poorer quality diet than other moose. They switch to eating high quality spring and summer foods later than other moose and they eat significantly fewer high preference shrubs and significantly more herbs and low preference shrubs than other moose. To avoid predators, cows with calves probably sacrifice the high quality diet available on the main island. The wolves not only affect prey numbers by direct kills but may also indirectly influence prey numbers by altering the diet of their prey. In this case, the reproductive cows, those individuals that contribute most directly to growth of the population, avoid predators but frequent poor feeding areas.																			0029-8549	1432-1939					1983	60	2					185	189		10.1007/BF00379520	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00379520								28310485					WOS:A1983RP06000006
J	Wilson, CL; Hinman, NW; Cooper, WJ; Brown, CF				Wilson, CL; Hinman, NW; Cooper, WJ; Brown, CF			Hydrogen peroxide cycling in surface geothermal waters of Yellowstone National Park	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), iron, and sulfide ion were measured every 4 h over 40-h periods at four hot springs in Yellowstone National Park, WY: an alkaline spring (Black Sand Pool); the sulfur-rich, near-neutral Roadside Spring near Nymph Lake; and two iron-rich, acidic springs (Chocolate Pots and the iron-rich Roadside Spring near Nymph Lake). Hydrogen peroxide concentrations reached 200-600 nM by late afternoon and decreased, in most cases, to less than 50 nM during the night. Diel changes in H2O2 concentrations suggest that photo chemically mediated processes were responsible far its formation. Photochemical reactions with DOC are likely the primary pathway responsible for H2O2 formation in geothermal waters. Although microbially mediated processes are important in limiting the buildup of H2O2, the inverse relationship between H2O2 and sulfide ion suggests that H2O2 decay may also occur via chemically mediated processes in the sulfur-rich waters.

We synthesized subfossil Pediastrum records from arid central Asia (ACA) and the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) region in order to characterize their hydro-climatic evolution during the Holocene. In ACA, low concentrations of subfossil Pediastrum during the early Holocene resulted from the higher salinity caused by a dry climate or lower lake levels. The increasing trend of subfossil Pediastrum content during the middle-late Holocene is consistent with the occurrence of wetter regional climatic conditions. In the marginal areas of the Asian summer monsoon (MASM) region of northern China, the variations in subfossil Pediastrum concentration coincide with increased summer monsoon rainfall during the middle Holocene, but concentrations were generally lower during the late Holocene as a result of increased salinity or alkalinity associated with a weakened summer monsoon. In the Tibetan Plateau, the variations in subfossil Pediastrum abundance are more complicated due to divergent moisture/precipitation patterns influenced by both the ASM and the mid-latitude westerlies. In the Indian summer monsoon-dominated region, subfossil Pediastrum abundance was high during the early Holocene and then gradually decreased after similar to 8 cal kyr BP. The observed asynchronous changes in subfossil Pediastrum in ACA and the MASM region during the Holocene may reflect the specific moisture/precipitation patterns of the monsoon- or westerlies-dominated climatic regimes. We suggest that high evaporation in arid and semi-arid areas would have rapidly increased the salinity and/or alkalinity of lakes, while aquatic environments may have been more stable in more humid areas.

J	Hsu, YH; Chou, C; Wei, KY				Hsu, Yang-Hui; Chou, Chia; Wei, Kuo-Yen			Land-Ocean Asymmetry of Tropical Precipitation Changes in the Mid-Holocene	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												A series of model experiments were conducted using an intermediate ocean atmosphere land model for a better understanding of a distinct land sea asymmetry in tropical precipitation differences between the mid-Holocene and preindustrial climates. In austral (boreal) summer, most reduced (enhanced) precipitation occurs over continental convective regions, while most enhanced (reduced) precipitation occurs over oceanic convection zones. This land sea asymmetry of tropical precipitation is particularly clear in austral summer. During the mid-Holocene, the solar forcing presents both spatial and seasonal asymmetric patterns. While the boreal summer insolation is stronger at high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere in the mid-Holocene than at present, the austral summer insolation is weaker with a more spatially symmetric distribution about the equator. Because of the slow response time of the ocean to forcing, the direct insolation forcing of the current season is cancelled by the ocean memory of an earlier insolation forcing, which in the case of the mid-Holocene is opposite to the current season insolation forcing. As a result, tropical sea surface temperature variation, as well as the tropical atmospheric temperature and moisture changes, is small, which gives rise to a different precipitation response from under the condition of stronger atmospheric temperature and moisture changes, such as in the case of postindustrial global warming induced by an increased concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gases. Thus, the cancellation between the direct and memory effects of the seasonally asymmetric insolation forcing leaves the net energy into the atmosphere to be responsible for the land sea asymmetry of tropical precipitation changes.

Field data in combination with bioenergetics modeling indicated that invertebrate planktivory by Chaoborus depressed cladoceran populations during early summer. In particular, bosminids that generally form the spring biomass peak of cladocerans in stratified temperate lakes did not appear in the samples until July. In July, predation pressure by chaoborids was relaxed due to their emergence period and cladoceran population growth appeared to be limited by predation by planktivorous fish. The effect of fish predation was amplified by reduced refuge availability for cladocerans. The concentration of dissolved oxygen below the epilimnion was depleted, forcing cladocerans to move upward to less turbid and thus more dangerous water layers. The effect of size selective predation by fish resulted in reduced mean size of cladocerans during the period when refuge thickness (thickness of the water layer with oxygen concentration < 1 mg l(-1) and water turbidity > 30 NTU) was lowest. The results confirmed that in clay-turbid lakes, invertebrate predators could be the main regulators of herbivorous zooplankton even when cyprinid fish are abundant.

Relative survival of lake trout stocked at different sizes and quality in Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Beginning in 1995, the size of yearling lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) stocked into the upper Great Lakes was increased based on the assumption that these fish would be healthier and survive better since natural mortality is thought to be inversely proportional to body size. We compared the post-release, relative survival of paired stockings of lake trout reared to 44 fishing (standard size) with larger fish reared to 22-26 fish/kg (enhanced size) in Lake Michigan. About 60,000 lake trout each of the standard and enhanced sizes for the 1994-1997 year classes were released as yearlings in spring near Clay Banks Reef, Wisconsin, and identified with coded-wire tags and an adipose fin-clip. Recaptures were made from 1997 to 2003 in four gill net surveys conducted in spring and fall near the release location. Comparisons of catch-per-unit of effort corrected for numbers stocked generally indicated no significant differences in relative survival of standard and enhanced lake trout. An autopsy-based assessment of overall fish health and condition indicated few measures where significantly different between standard and enhanced lake trout prior to stocking. Size differences between standard and enhanced fish remained statistically significant at all observed ages at recapture; however growth rates were the same for the two groups. Stocking numbers at certain sites on Lake Michigan were reduced concurrent with the change to larger yearlings with the expectation of increased survival, which did not occur; hence recruitment was essentially reduced in these areas for the restoration program.																			0380-1330						2006	32	2					386	394		10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[386:RSOLTS]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[386:RSOLTS]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000239185200014
J	HEALEY, MC				HEALEY, MC			SPHAERIID MOLLUSK POPULATIONS OF 8 LAKES NEAR YELLOWKNIFE, NORTHWEST TERRITORIES	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												Sphaeriidae were about twice as abundant in 8 lakes near Yellowknife, Northwest Territories [Canada] as previously reported for Precambrian Shield lakes. Depth distribution varied from lake to lake and there appeared to be no predictable distribution of Sphaeriidae with depth even among limnologically similar lakes. In the Yellowknife lakes, depth distribution was dictated by the relative abundance of individual species and their particular depth distribution in the lake. Nepionic forms were, relatively, most abundant in the littoral zone and, seasonally, most abundant in summer and autumn. Nepionic forms were more abundant later in the profundal of the lakes than in the littoral, suggesting delay of reproduction in deeper water. In general the sphaeriid clam community was dominated by 1 or 2 spp. in each lake and Pisidium conventus was the most common dominant, reaching densities in excess of 400/m2 in the profundal of Drygeese Lake. P. conventus was also the only species common in the profundal, all others being abundant only in the littoral zone, where some species reached densities in excess of 400/m2. Three species, Sphaerium lacustre, P. nitidum contortum and P. nitidum pauperculum, were uncommon members of the fauna of northern Precambrian Shield lakes. The presence of these species apparently reflects the intermediate nature of the Yellowknife lakes between typical Precambrian Shield lakes and lakes in sedimentary basins. The common species in the lakes appear to have similar habitat requirements and variations in abundance could not be related to any gross differences in the limnology of the Yellowknife lakes.																			0008-3550						1978	92	3					242	251																WOS:A1978FQ86200004

Lake Superior Kiyi reproductive biology	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Objective: The Lake Superior Kiyi Coregonus kiyi is an understudied species being considered for reintroduction into Laurentian Great Lakes where it no longer occurs. Herein, we provide descriptions of Kiyi reproductive biology with the intention of guiding potential gamete collections for propagation. Methods: Data were collected on Kiyi spawning timing, spawning locations, spawning season catch rates, length at sexual maturity, sex ratios, fecundity, egg size, and larval occurrences in Lake Superior from 1996-2021. These data were compared to observations made a century prior in Lakes Michigan, Ontario, and Superior. Result: Contemporary Kiyi spawning occurred between late December and late January when surface water temperatures cooled to <4 degrees C. Spawning Kiyi were caught almost exclusively in 38.1-mm stretch mesh, as compared to larger meshes (50.8-76.2 mm). Capture depths for developing, ripe, running, and spent female Kiyi were similar and ranged from 82 to 221 m. Fifty percent of female and male Kiyi were classified as sexually mature at similar to 150 mm total length. Fecundity estimates ranged from 1,578 to 6,720 eggs/female. Mean diameter of unfertilized eggs was 1.7 mm. Recently hatched larval Kiyi were collected at the surface during May-July at 62 of the 113 locations sampled throughout the lake in 2019. Conclusion: Our work suggests that Kiyi gamete collection efforts from mid-December through January using 38.1-mm gill-net panels set at bathymetric depths of at least 100 m would maximize the collection of spawning Kiyi and reduce the bycatch of other Coregonus species. Future research questions include the following: (1) "Do Kiyi form spawning aggregations at specific spawning areas, or do they spawn indiscriminately across the lake?"; (2) "Do Kiyi spawn near the bottom or up in the water column?"; (3) "What is the relationship between fall lake overturn and Kiyi spawn timing?"; and (4) "Could summer larval and age-0 Kiyi collections provide an opportunity for establishing a captive broodstock?"

To assess these effects, we measured in situ carbon assimilation rates and ambient light intensities over 18 months. Based on experimental data, a numerical model was developed to assess gross primary production under present light conditions and those under a hypothetical case without upstream dams. Light conditions for the hypothetical 'no-dam' situation were estimated from pre-dam Secchi depths and simulated 'no-dam' particle concentrations. Current gross primary production is low (similar to 66 gC m(-2) yr(-1)), and could increase similar to 44% if the lake was less turbid. Disregarding nutrient retention in reservoirs, we estimate gross primary production would be similar to 35% lower in summer and similar to 23% higher in winter in the absence of reservoirs. The annual primary production (similar to 58 gC m(-2)yr(-1)) would decrease similar to 12% compared to the current primary production with dams. According to model calculations, hydropower operations have significantly altered the seasonal dynamics, but have little effect on annual primary production in Lake Brienz.

Archival tags reveal that Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus and brown trout Salmo trutta can use estuarine and marine waters during winter	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												By tagging north-Norwegian anadromous riverine Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus and brown trout Salmo trutta with simple archival tags that measured ambient water temperature and relating the recordings to the temperature in the surrounding environments, it was demonstrated that 91% of the S. trutta and 80% of the S. alpinus utilized the estuarine and marine environment during the winter. There was large individual variation in migratory behaviour. Salvelinus alpinus on average entered the estuary on 12 January and the marine environment on 26 February, had continuous marine migrations lasting up to 55 days, and spent on average 40 days in the estuary and 25 days in the sea during the winter. The corresponding numbers for S. trutta were 15 December and 4 January for first entry in the estuary and sea, maximum 39 days in the marine environment and average number of days in the estuary and sea were 34 and 50. Most individuals of both species frequently shifted between the three habitats. These findings thus contradict previous studies conducted on lake-dwelling populations, which suggested that northern populations of both species solely overwinter in fresh water. The use of inexpensive temperature recording archival tags gave detailed continuous information on seasonal migrations between habitats with different thermal characteristics.

High-elevation ice patches are known to be important archaeological archives in alpine regions and potentially could provide records important for Earth System Model evaluation and to understand linkages between climate and early human activities, but this potential largely is unexplored. Here we use a well-dated ice-core record from a shallow ice patch to investigate Rocky Mountain winter-season climate during the Holocene. Our records indicate that this ice patch consistently accumulated ice over the past 10 kyr, preserving a regionally representative climate record of stable water isotopes and ice accretion rates that documented generally cooler and wetter conditions during the early Holocene and 500 years of anomalous winter season warmth centered at 4100 cal yr BP followed by a rapid cooling and 1500 years of cooler and wetter winters.

To foster enhanced forecasting ability and verification, improvement of these lake models remains essential. This especially applies to the limited simulation capabilities of biogeo-chemical processes in lakes and greenhouse gas exchanges with the atmosphere. Here we present multi-model simulations of physical variables and dissolved gas dynamics in a temperate lake (Harp Lake, Canada). The five models (ALBM, FLake, LAKE, LAKEoneD, MTCR-1) considered within this most recent round of the Lake Model Intercomparison Project (LakeMIP) all captured the seasonal temperature variability well. In contrast, none of the models is able to reproduce the exact dates of ice cover and ice off, leading to considerable errors in the simulation of eddy diffusivity around those dates. We then conducted an additional modeling experiment with a diffusing passive tracer to isolate the effect of the eddy diffusivity on gas concentration. Remarkably, sophisticated kappa - epsilon models do not demonstrate a significant difference in the vertical diffusion of a passive tracer compared to models with much simpler turbulence closures. All the models simulate less intensive spring overturn compared to autumn. Reduced mixing in the models consequently leads to the accumulation of the passive tracer distribution in the water column. The lake models with a comprehensive biogeochemical module, such as the ALBM and LAKE, predict dissolved oxygen dynamics adequate to the observed data. However, for the surface carbon dioxide concentration the correlation between modeled (ALBM, LAKE) and observed data is weak (similar to 0.3). Overall our results indicate the need to improve the representation of physical and biogeochemical processes in lake models, thereby contributing to enhanced weather prediction and climate projection capabilities.

The testate amoebae record indicate spells of winter monsoon between ca. 17,000 cal BP and 13,700 cal BP. Increased diversity of diatoms, testate amoebae and sponge spicules, in addition to low Humidity/Aridity Index (Iph) values suggest strengthened monsoon inducing the expansion of lake margin and high primary productivity during ca. 13,700 to 4300 cal BP. Further between ca. 4300 and 2900 cal BP, higher Iph values and related responses of other studied proxies show a stressed lake ecosystem. Since ca. 2900 cal BP, area of the lake was reduced responding to low intensity of the Indian Summer Monsoon. Anthropogenic activities may also have played a role in the lake shrinking at least during some parts of this duration. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

As a result, nigorobuna arrived at the juvenile stage exceeding approximately 16 mm in standard length and released to the Phragmites australis reed zone showed a rapid increase in survival rate. A remarkable decrease in the survival rate of stocked fish in the lake was observed in cases of 1) release to the reed-free lake shore, 2) reduction of the depth of flooded reed zone according to draw down of water level by artificial manipulation, 3) growth retardation of reed in spring by excessive cutting management of reed in winter, and 4) excessive release of nigorobuna larvae to a limited reed zone. Larvae-release techniques which overcome the problems and reed zone-independent release methods for nigorobuna should be developed in the future.

J	Akomeah, E; Lindenschmidt, KE				Akomeah, Eric; Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich			Seasonal Variation in Sediment Oxygen Demand in a Northern Chained River-Lake System	WATER												Sediment oxygen demand (SOD) contributes immensely to hypolimnetic oxygen depletion. SOD rates thus play a key role in aquatic ecosystems' health predictions. These rates, however, can be very expensive to sample. Moreover, determination of SOD rates by sediment diagenesis modeling may require very large datasets, or may not be easily adapted to complex aquatic systems. Water quality modeling for northern aquatic systems is emerging and little is known about the seasonal trends of SOD rates for complex aquatic systems. In this study, the seasonal trend of SOD rates for a northern chained river-lake system has been assessed through the calibration of a water quality model. Model calibration and validation showed good agreement with field measurements. Results of the study show that, in the riverine section, SOD20 rates decreased from 1.9 to 0.79 g/m(2)/day as urban effluent traveled along the river while a SOD20 rate of 2.2 g/m(2)/day was observed in the lakes. Seasonally, the SOD20 rates in summer were three times higher than those in winter for both river and lakes. The results of the study provide insights to the seasonal trend of SOD rates especially for northern rivers and lakes and can, thus, be useful for more complex water quality modeling studies in the region.

The benefits of being big: effects of body size on energy budgets of three wintering goose species grazing Carex beds in the Yangtze River floodplain, China	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												Herbivores of different body size vary in food selection because of their different metabolic requirements and abilities to harvest and digest food. Compared with smaller grazers, larger ones require higher food quantity but can tolerate poorer quality. This divergence may also explain habitat partitioning in the distribution of closely related species. By estimating daily energy expenditure (based on observed activity budgets) and energy intake (using the indigestible marker method in food and faeces), we compared the field energy budgets of three wintering herbivorous goose species differing in body size feeding on the same Carex meadows. Throughout the winter, the larger Bean Geese Anser fabalis serrirostris and Greater White-fronted Geese Anser albifrons maintained positive energy budgets grazing lower quality Carex, in contrast to the smaller Lesser White-fronted Geese Anser erythropus which failed to do so and could only maintain positive energy budgets by grazing high-quality Alopecurus, Cynodon and Eleocharis. However, all three species failed to maintain positive energy balance and lost mass in mid-winter. These results have important implications for explaining the divergent distribution patterns of these species on their wintering grounds in China.

J	Liu, Y; Chen, HP; Li, HX; Wang, HJ				Liu, Yong; Chen, Huopo; Li, Huixin; Wang, Huijun			The Impact of Preceding Spring Antarctic Oscillation on the Variations of Lake Ice Phenology over the Tibetan Plateau	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												The lake ice phenology response to climate change has been receiving growing concern in recent years. However, most studies have put emphasis on the spatial and temporal variability of lake ice phenology, and relatively few studies have been devoted to investigating the physical mechanisms of changes in lake ice phenology from the perspective of climatic dynamics. This study investigates the possible impact of the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) on the variations in lake ice phenology over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The results show that there is an intimate relationship between the AAO and the variations in break-up/ice duration during the period 2003-15. Further analysis indicates that the preceding boreal spring AAO-induced atmospheric circulation anomalies are favorable for generating tropical South Atlantic Ocean SST anomalies through air-sea interaction. Then the tropical SST anomalies strengthen the anomalous local-scale meridional-vertical circulation that projects into the Azores high and further induce the extratropical portion of the North Atlantic SST tripole. The anomalous warm core in the North Atlantic serves as the source of wave activity flux and stimulates a stationary wave train along the Eurasian continent to change the downstream atmospheric circulation. As a response, an abnormal cyclone and enhanced updraft are triggered over the TP, which are favorable for the formation of snowfall and then lower the surface air temperature according to the snow-albedo feedback mechanism, and thus result in the prolonged lake ice duration events. This study provides a new insight to link the AAO influence and climate over the TP and is helpful to understand the changes in lake ice phenology in response to climate change in recent years.					; Huopo, Chen/B-7771-2013	Li, Huixin/0000-0002-2634-6486; Liu, Yong/0000-0003-0837-0244													0894-8755	1520-0442				JAN	2020	33	2					639	656		10.1175/JCLI-D-19-0111.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-19-0111.1													WOS:000504084500003

Biological plasticity of non-native European perch (Perca fluviatilis) populations and the implications for management in northern New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Size and age structure, longevity, growth, and reproductive activity of European perch (Perca fluviatilis) were studied at Lake Wainamu in March 2012 and 2013 as part of an introduced species eradication programme. Size and age structure of P. fluviatilis were dominated by smaller and younger individuals, while maximum age was estimated at 6 and 5 years for both years, respectively. Initial growth by the end of first year was faster when compared with selected studies in Europe, but size-at-equivalent age thereafter was smaller at Lake Wainamu. Oocyte atresia, asynchronous gonad development and vitellogenic oocytes were prevalent in ovaries at time of sampling in later summer, which warrant further investigation of P. fluviatilis as an iteroparous spring-spawning species in northern New Zealand. Our findings imply that the population dynamics of P. fluviatilis are highly plastic and may be influenced by local biogeographical factors. This has strong implications for the management of P. fluviatilis in New Zealand freshwater systems.

The leading mode of summer SAT variations features a northern Eurasian SAT tripole (NEST) pattern, with two same-sign SAT anomaly regions over eastern Europe-western Siberia and the Far East region and an opposite-sign SAT anomaly region around the Baikal Lake. It is found that sea surface temperature (SST) or SAT anomalies in the tropical Atlantic and rainfall-soil moisture anomalies around the Baikal Lake during May can modulate the NEST pattern. The SST anomalies in the tropical Atlantic persist from May to summer and induce a downstream zonal wave train across northern Eurasia, consequently causing the variation in the summer NEST pattern. May rainfall anomalies around the Baikal Lake affect the overlying atmospheric circulation during summer through the 'memory' effect of soil moisture and the soil moisture-rainfall interaction, correspondingly modulating the downstream wave train and the associated NEST pattern. Based on the above results, a statistical prediction model is established using the two precursory signals, that is, SAT in the tropical Atlantic and rainfall around the Baikal Lake during May. The leave-three-out cross-validation shows that the model has a high skill in predicting the summer NEST pattern, with a correlation coefficient of 0.51 (significant at the 99.8% confidence level) between observation and prediction during the period 1980-2016.

Modeling the "Pop" in Winter Terrain Park Jumps	SKIING TRAUMA AND SAFETY, VOL 19	American Society for Testing and Materials Selected Technical Papers				19th Congress of the International-Society-for-Skiing-Safety (ISSS)	MAY 01-07, 2011	Keystone, CO	Int Soc Skiing Safety				Epidemiological studies of injuries at ski resorts have found that jumping generally poses a significantly greater risk of spine and head injuries to patrons than other actions. Jumping activities in resorts are now centered in terrain parks containing man-made features, which provides an opportunity to mitigate injury rates through better engineering design. However, the use of engineering design has been questioned by the National Ski Areas Association because of the issue of rider variability (Freestyle Terrain Park Notebook, National Ski Areas Association, Lakewood, CO, 2008), and this view was implicitly supported in a recent paper by Shealy et al. ["Jumper Kinematics on Terrain Park Jumps: Relationship between Takeoff Speed and Distance Traveled," J. ASTM Int., Vol. 7(10), 2010, pp. 1-10], who studied jumper trajectories for two terrain park jumps and reported no correlation between takeoff speeds and landing distances. Although their theoretical analysis was flawed, the undeniable fact remains that rider actions can substantially influence trajectory. In particular, riders can "pop," i.e., jump (or drop) before takeoff, thereby changing the initial velocity in terms of both direction and magnitude. In this paper I expand on an earlier Newtonian analysis to include this effect and use the field data of Shealy et al. to constrain the range of realistic pop speeds. I find that pop speeds in the range of -2.48 to +1.12 m/s account for the range of landing distances measured by Shealy et al. Because the rider variability due to pop is bounded, similar Newtonian analyses can provide bounds on the range of trajectories, landing positions, landing velocities, and equivalent fall heights that might be useful to winter terrain park designers.

In addition to high nutrient loads, climate-induced changes in lake stratification and mixing represent additional anthropogenic menace resulting in decreased deepwater oxygen levels. The analysis of 43 years of monitoring data from Lake Geneva shows no decreasing trend neither in the areal hypolimnetic mineralization rate nor in the extent of hypoxia. Instead, hypoxic conditions are predominantly controlled by deep mixing in winter and much less by the trophic variations over the past decades. To reproduce winter mixing, the one-dimensional hydrodynamic model SIMSTRAT was specially adapted to deep lakes and run for several climate scenarios. The simulations predicted a decrease in the maximum winter mixing depth from an average of similar to 172 m for 1981-2012 to similar to 136 m and similar to 127 m in response to predicted atmospheric temperatures between 2045-2076 and 2070-2101 according to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios. Concurrently, events with complete homogenization of temperature and oxygen in winter will decrease by similar to 50%. Consequently, the hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations will significantly decrease. These results demonstrate that changes in deep mixing can have stronger impact than eutrophication on the deepwater oxygen levels of oligomictic lakes.					; Wuest, Alfred/L-2607-2014; Schwefel, Robert/AAF-7505-2019	Bouffard, Damien/0000-0002-2005-9718; Schwefel, Robert/0000-0003-1610-4181													0043-1397	1944-7973				NOV	2016	52	11					8794	8809		10.1002/2016WR019194	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016WR019194													WOS:000393318600023

The estimation model of the TSM concentration in Lake Taihu was developed using top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance of MERIS image data at band 9 in combination with a regional empirical atmospheric correction model, which was strongly correlated with the in situ TSM concentration (r(2) = 0.720, p<0.001, and n = 73). The relative root mean square error (RRMSE) and mean relative error (MRE) were 36.9% and 31.6%, respectively, based on an independent validation dataset that produced reliable estimations of the TSM concentration. The developed algorithm was applied to 50 MERIS images from 2003 to 2011 to obtain a high spatial and temporal heterogeneity of TSM concentrations in Lake Taihu. Seasonally, the highest and lowest TSM concentrations were found in spring and autumn, respectively. Spatially, TSM concentrations were high in the southern part and center of the lake and low in Xukou Bay, East Lake Taihu. The lake topography, including the water depth and distance from the shore, had a significant effect on the TSM spatial distribution. A significant correlation was found between the daily average wind speed and TSM concentration (r(2) = 0.685, p, 0.001, and n = 50), suggesting a critical role of wind speed in the TSM variations in Lake Taihu. In addition, a low TSM concentration was linked to the appearance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). Therefore, TSM dynamics were controlled by the lake topography, wind-driven sediment resuspension and SAV distribution.					; Shi, Kun/O-2638-2013; Qin, Boqiang/E-5900-2013; Liu, Xiaohan/AGS-6555-2022; Zhang, Yunlin/N-5464-2014	Zhou, Yongqiang/0000-0003-1402-345X; Shi, Kun/0000-0002-6124-7512; Zhang, Yunlin/0000-0002-3382-4570													1932-6203					MAY 20	2014	9	5							e98055	10.1371/journal.pone.0098055	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0098055								24846206					WOS:000339563400087

No natural surface thermal manifestations are present in the sands and silts of this part of the southern Carson Sink, but one shallow artesian thermal well is present. Public domain gravity and aeromagnetic data have been reprocessed and interpreted. When integrated with geologic mapping these provide a structural setting for the resource area. Self-potential (SP) surveys completed in the spring of 1992 and 1993 identified ten well-defined anomalies of limited extent within the area of the shallow thermal anomaly. Several of these anomalies occur near interpreted structures and structural intersections and may indicate upflow zones of thermal fluids to the near subsurface. Deep drilling is needed to prove the location and economic potential of the moderate-temperature geothermal reservoir.																			0193-5933		0-934412-80-4				1996	20						393	400																WOS:A1996BH49E00057

This study aimed to evaluate the relationships between land use and reservoir characteristics at two spatial scales, after controlling for spatial processes. Water and surface sediment samples were collected from 31 sites (7 reservoirs) in the Paiva Castro and Piracicaba River basins (Cantareira System, Sao Paulo State, Brazil), during austral summer and winter. The dataset included 15 water quality variables and 6 surface sediment variables. Land use variables (natural areas, pasture, agriculture and urban areas) were obtained at two spatial scales (buffer and watershed) in each reservoir. Spatial variables were calculated using Moran's Eigenvectors Maps and Asymmetric Eigenvector Maps. The strengths of the relationships between land use and sediment variables were stronger than those between land use and water quality variables. The strengths of some of the relationships were scale-dependent.

Sequential fractionation of phosphorus in sediments of El-Fayum lakes-Egypt	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The amounts and forms of potentially mobile phosphorus (P) in surface sediments of Qarun and Wadi El-Rayan lakes were evaluated during winter and summer using a sequential chemical extraction. Five sedimentary P fractions were separately quantified: loosely sorbed P (NH4Cl-P), iron-associated P (BD-P), calcium- bound P (HCl-P), metal oxide bound P (NaOH-P), and residual P (organic and refractory P). The results indicated that the fractional composition of the examined lakes was different while the total P concentrations were approached. The inorganic P in the surface sediment mainly consisted of Ca-P followed by Fe-P in Qarun Lake, while Al-P took the second order in Wadi El-Rayan lakes. The ranks order of the different P extracts were HCl-P > residual-P a parts per thousand NaOH-P > NH4Cl-P > BD-P and residual-P > NH4Cl-P > HCl-P > NaOH-P > BD-P for Qarun and Wadi El-Rayan lakes, respectively.					; Abdel-Satar, Amaal/AAJ-6756-2020	fekry, mohsen/0000-0002-9437-3128; Abdel-Satar, Amaal/0000-0002-0319-3165													0167-6369	1573-2959				OCT	2010	169	1-4					169	178		10.1007/s10661-009-1160-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-009-1160-x								19757113					WOS:000281597600016

This atypical insect feeds throughout the winter but populations can sustain high mortality when winter-season extreme minimum temperatures drop below -20 to -30 degrees C. Detection of HWA in Michigan during 2015 motivated interest in HWA winter survival in the US Great Lakes region. Here, we used the parameter-elevation regressions on independent slopes model (PRISM) gridded daily minimum temperature dataset to construct a 1981-2018 climatology of extreme minimum temperatures in the Great Lakes region, the first such effort for this region. Metrics examined include absolute and mean annual extreme minimum temperatures (defined as the lowest daily minimum temperature during the study period and the study-period mean lowest daily minimum temperature during each calendar year, respectively), and the frequency of daily minimum temperatures below -20 and -30 degrees C. Minimum temperature patterns we identified support the following two hypotheses: first, proximity to water, surface elevation and latitude are the principal controls for extreme minimum temperatures in the Great Lakes region; second, the modifying influence of the relatively warm Lake Michigan serves to protect locations within about 10-25 km of the lakeshore from severe and potentially lethal temperatures for HWA. Analysis of projected minimum temperatures at the end of the 21st century (2080-2099) reveals a range of HWA distribution expansion scenarios. Although the original motivation for this study arose from interest in potential HWA mortality, a climatological study of extreme minimum temperatures has potentially broad relevance to, for example, human health and safety and forest ecology.					; Baule, William/KHV-6041-2024	Baule, William/0000-0002-9279-8851; Kiefer, Michael/0000-0002-4824-0148													0899-8418	1097-0088				JUN 15	2022	42	7					3596	3615		10.1002/joc.7434	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.7434		NOV 2021											WOS:000716088000001

Artificial UV-B and solar radiation reduce in vitro infectivity of the human pathogen Cryptosporidium parvum	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The potential for solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation to act as a significant abiotic control of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts in nature is unknown. Infectivity of C. parvum following exposure to artificial UV-B and natural solar radiation, with and without UV wavelengths, was tested under controlled pH and temperature conditions. Percent infectivity of exposed oocysts was determined by in vitro cell culture. Artificial UV-B exposures of 32 and 66 kJ/m(2) significantly decreased oocyst infectivity by an average of 58 and 98%, respectively. Exposure of oocysts to approximately half and full intensity of full solar spectrum (all wavelengths) for a period of less than 1 day (10 h) in mid-summer reduced mean infectivity by an average of 67% and >99.99%, respectively. Exposure of the C. parvum oocysts to UV-shielded solar radiation (>404 nm) in early autumn reduced mean infectivity by 52%, while full spectrum solar radiation (exposure at all wavelengths) reduced mean infectivity by 97%. The data provide strong evidence that exposure to natural solar radiation can significantly reduce C. parvum infectivity. Direct effects of solar radiation on oocysts in nature will depend on the depth distribution of the oocysts, water transparency, mixing conditions, and perhaps other environmental factors such as temperature, pH, and stress.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				OCT 15	2007	41	20					7101	7106		10.1021/es071324r	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es071324r								17993154					WOS:000250110800038

Modern seasonality in Lake Challa (Kenya/Tanzania) and its sedimentary documentation in recent lake sediments	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												From November 2006 to January 2010, a sediment trap that was cleared monthly was deployed in Lake Challa, a deep stratified freshwater lake on the eastern slope of Mt. Kilimanjaro in southern Kenya. Geochemical data from sediment trap samples were compared with a broad range of limnological and meteorological parameters to characterize the effect of single parameters on productivity and sedimentation processes in the crater basin. During the southern hemisphere summer (November-March), when the water temperature is high and the lake is biologically productive (nondiatom algae), calcite predominated in the sediment trap samples. During the "long rain" season (March-May) a small amount of organic matter and lithogenic material caused by rainfall appeared. This was followed by the cool and windy months of the southern hemisphere winter (June-October) when diatoms were the main component, indicating a diatom bloom initiated by improvement of nutrient availability related to upwelling processes. The sediment trap data support the hypothesis that the light-dark lamination couplets, which are abundant in Lake Challa cores, reflect seasonal delivery to the sediments of diatom-rich particulates during the windy months and diatom-poor material during the wet season. However, interannual and spatial variability in upwelling and productivity patterns, as well as El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related rainfall and drought cycles, exert a strong influence on the magnitude and geochemical composition of particle export to the hypolimnion of Lake Challa.

J	Zelano, V; Zambrotta, M; Defilippi, A; Torazzo, A				Zelano, V; Zambrotta, M; Defilippi, A; Torazzo, A			Water quality of two glacial alpine Italian lakes	ANNALI DI CHIMICA												The purpose of this study was to characterize, in a period of one year, two glacial lakes, Alice and Meugliano, located in an alpine reservoir oil the basis of physical and chemical features. The two lakes show two periods of mixing: one in the spring and one in the autumn, so can be classified as dimictic lakes(1). They are characterized by pH. alkalinity. low conductivity and and quite dilute ionic concentrations. With regard to nutrients. most nitrogen occurred in the nitric form in the superficial layers. During the period of thermal stratification. in the anoxic layer NO3- decreases and NH4+ increases, confirming the activity of the anaerobic denitrificant bacteria. Total and soluble phosphorus levels show homogeneity during the cold period at different depths, while with stratification concentrations increase in the hypolimnium and metalimnium. In both lakes there is an inverse correlation between transparency and chlorophyll a. To evaluate the trophic state the conventional criteria of Nurnberg(2) and four lake trophic indices (TSIs) are used(3.4). Both evaluations suggest that the two lakes are eutrophic. with worse conditions in Alice. Deviations of the trophic states, based on the relation between TSIs(5.6), indicate that factors other than phosphorous limit the algal biomass. and that non-algal particles influence light attenuation.																			0003-4592					NOV-DEC	2005	95	11-12					845	856		10.1002/adic.200590097	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adic.200590097								16398348					WOS:000234850700011

Three anaerobically digested municipal sludges (Chicago, Salt Lake City, and Idaho Falls) were added to field plots of the calcareous Millville soil (Typic Haploxeroll) and planted to 'Larker' spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and Swiss chard (Beta vulgaris, L. var. 'Cicla'). Each sludge was added yearly at 20 Mg ha(-1) for 5 years; the Chicago sludge was also added once (the first year) at 100 Mg ha(-1), and also at 40 Mg ha(-1) the first and third years. Increased sludge additions increased metal concentrations in barley and Swiss chard. The first year, adding 21.2 kg Cd ha(-1) in 100 Mg ha(-1) of Chicago sludge increased plant Cd concentrations about six-fold (from 0.11 to 0.64 mg kg(-1) in grain and from 0.7 to 4.4 mg kg(-1) in Swiss chard). In subsequent years the increase in Cd was smaller. The relatively small Cd additions in 20 Mg ha(-1) of Salt Lake and Idaho Falls sludges did not increase Cd in barley grain. Concentrations of Zn, Cu, and Ni did not increase as greatly as Cd following sludge addition. Although only a few individual barley grain samples exceeded the recommended maximum of 0.5 mg Cd kg(-1) for feeds, most of the barley leaf and Swiss chard samples were much higher in Cd than the 0.5 mg kg(-1) level. The Zn, Cu, and Ni levels in the crops were below suggested threshold values.																			0167-8809					AUG	1995	55	1					1	6		10.1016/0167-8809(95)00610-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0167-8809(95)00610-5													WOS:A1995TD96700001

Carbonate sedimentation and effects of eutrophication observed at the Kalista subaquatic springs in Lake Ohrid (Macedonia)	BIOGEOSCIENCES												To date, little is known about the role of spring waters with respect to authigenic carbonate precipitation in a shallow lacustrine setting. Lake Ohrid, located in Southeastern Europe, is a large lake fed to over 50% by karstic springs of which half enter subaquatically and influence significantly its ecology and species distribution. In order to evaluate how sedimentological processes are influenced by such shallow-water springs, the Kalista subaquatic spring area in the north west of Lake Ohrid was investigated by a sidescan sonar survey and with sediment traps and three transects of gravity short cores. Results indicate that sedimentation in the spring area is dominated by authigenic carbonate precipitation. High sedimentation rates and evidences for bio-induced precipitation processes were observed in the water column and in the sediments. Two distinct stratigraphic units characterize the shallow subsurface, both composed of carbonate silts with high carbonate contents of up to 96%, but differing in color, carbonate content and diatom content. A chronological correlation of the cores by radiocarbon dates and Cs-137 activities places the transition between the two stratigraphic units after similar to 1955 AD. At that time, coastal sedimentation changed drastically to significantly darker sediments with higher contents of organic matter and more abundant diatoms. This change coincides with the recent human impact of littoral eutrophication.

The analysis of the results shows a clearly pronounced vertical zonality of the microbial processes occurring in the water column of the lake. To a depth of 8 m, the total number and activity of microorganisms was limited by the relatively low content of organic matter (OM). In the upper part of the hydrogen-sulfide zone of the take (beginning at a depth of 8.25 m), the content of particulate OM and the microbial number sharply increased. In this zone, the daily production of OM during anaerobic photosynthesis at the expense of massive development of colored sulfur bacteria reached 620 mg C/m(2), which was twofold greater than the daily production of phytoplankton photosynthesis) thesis and led to a considerable change in the isotopic composition (delta C-13) of the particulate OM. In the same intermediate layer, the highest rates of sulfate reduction were recorded, and fractionation of stable sulfur isotopes occurred. Below 10 m, was the third hydrochemical zone, characterized by maximum concentrations of H2S and CH4 and by a relatively high rate of autotrophic methanogenesis. The comparison of the results obtained with the results of investigations of previous years, performed in the end of summer, shows a decrease in the intensity of all microbial processes inspected. An exception was anoxygenic photosynthesis, which can utilize not only the de novo formed H2S but also the H2S accumulated in the lake during the winter period.					; Lein, Alla/A-4971-2019; Ivanov, Maksim/K-2922-2018; Savvichev, Alexander/B-9245-2018	Pimenov, Nikolai/0000-0001-9757-0867; Bairamov, Iskander/0000-0001-9848-1719; 													0026-2617					SEP-OCT	2001	70	5					583	593		10.1023/A:1012368424223	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1012368424223								11763789					WOS:000172000100015

Molecular phylogenetics and microsatellite analysis reveal cryptic species of speckled dace (Cyprinidae: Rhinichthys osculus) in Oregon's Great Basin	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION												Speckled dace (Rhinichthys osculus) is a small cyprinid that occurs throughout western North America and is the most commonly occurring fish in Oregon. Because of the high genetic and morphological variation in this species across its range, it has been referred to as a species complex; however, no revision to its taxonomy has occurred since 1984. Here, the phylogenetics and population genetics of speckled dace are examined throughout Oregon's Great Basin to describe genetic variation and infer the geographic boundaries between distinct taxonomic entities and populations. We tested the validity of a putative subspecies, Foskett Spring speckled dace, that occurs in a single spring within Warner Valley in Southeast Oregon and is listed Federally as threatened. Dace were collected from Foskett Spring and all surrounding basins containing speckled dace (Warner, Goose Lake, Lake Abert, Silver Lake, and Malheur), as well as Stinking Lake Spring (located within Malheur), created phylogenetic trees from mitochondrial ND2 and nuclear S7 sequence data, and genotyped eight microsatellite loci for population-level analyses. Three highly divergent clades warrant species-level status: Malheur stream dace, Stinking Lake Spring dace, and dace from the other four basins combined. Although Foskett Spring dace were not monophyletic, substantial population structure occurs at the basin-level and separates Foskett Spring dace from other dace in the surrounding Warner Valley. Thus, we recommend ESU status for the isolated population of speckled dace in Foskett Spring. The high, previously unrecognized, taxonomic diversity within this region indicates a need for a range-wide phylogeographic study of speckled dace and an investigation of the morphological distinctiveness of the putative new species.

Move or die: change in European catfish (Silurus glanis L.) behaviour caused by oxygen deficiency	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												European catfish (Silurus glanis L.) is a large predatory fish native to an extensive area in Europe. It has been introduced to its western and southern parts, where it is considered an invasive species with a negative impact on native fishes. European catfish is a territorial species exhibiting site fidelity. Cold water in winter usually leads catfish to exhibit notably low activity. Nevertheless, our telemetric study on 19 juvenile individuals of S. glanis provides information on their unexpected high activity and displacement in winter. Our data reveal that these behavioural changes were caused by oxygen deficiency. Our data also indicate that oxygen deficits may induce migrations of this species.

Intracellular (cell-bound) Mcyst's were detectable from late summer to autumn in 2 years, and maximum concentrations of about 3 mu g/l of total cell-bound Mcyst were measured. The concentration of Mcyst's was correlated to the biovolume of Microcystis sp. (R-2=0.560 in 1996 and R-2=0.483 in 1997; P<0.001). Between years, the ratio of Mcyst'ss per biovolume of Microcystis differed significantly (P<0,001; 0.913 mu g/mm(3) in 1996 and 0.171 mu g/mm(3) in 1997). The ratio of the detected Mcyst variants, Mcyst-LR and Mcyst-RR, was constant in all samples with Mcyst-LR:Mcyst-RR approximate to 1:2.9. One out of 22 strains of Microcystis sp. we isolated in 1997 contained Mcyst-LR and Mcyst-RR at a ratio of Mcyst-LR:Mcyst-RR=1:1.6. The Mcyst'ss found in lake samples were likely to have been produced by a number of a few strains that were present in the lake for extended periods of time in both years.

Detectability of Arctic methane sources at six sites performing continuous atmospheric measurements	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Understanding the recent evolution of methane emissions in the Arctic is necessary to interpret the global methane cycle. Emissions are affected by significant uncertainties and are sensitive to climate change, leading to potential feedbacks. A polar version of the CHIMERE chemistry-transport model is used to simulate the evolution of tropospheric methane in the Arctic during 2012, including all known regional anthropogenic and natural sources, in particular freshwater emissions which are often overlooked in methane modelling. CHIMERE simulations are compared to atmospheric continuous observations at six measurement sites in the Arctic region. In winter, the Arctic is dominated by anthropogenic emissions; emissions from continental seepages and oceans, including from the East Siberian Arctic Shelf, can contribute significantly in more limited areas. In summer, emissions from wetland and freshwater sources dominate across the whole region. The model is able to reproduce the seasonality and synoptic variations of methane measured at the different sites. We find that all methane sources significantly affect the measurements at all stations at least at the synoptic scale, except for biomass burning. In particular, freshwater systems play a decisive part in summer, representing on average between 11 and 26% of the simulated Arctic methane signal at the sites. This indicates the relevance of continuous observations to gain a mechanistic understanding of Arctic methane sources. Sensitivity tests reveal that the choice of the land-surface model used to prescribe wetland emissions can be critical in correctly representing methane mixing ratios. The closest agreement with the observations is reached when using the two wetland models which have emissions peaking in August-September, while all others reach their maximum in JuneJuly. Such phasing provides an interesting constraint on wetland models which still have large uncertainties at present. Also testing different freshwater emission inventories leads to large differences in modelled methane. Attempts to include methane sinks (OH oxidation and soil uptake) reduced the model bias relative to observed atmospheric methane. The study illustrates how multiple sources, having different spatiotemporal dynamics and magnitudes, jointly influence the overall Arctic methane budget, and highlights ways towards further improved assessments.

Large rivers, however, are highly human-impacted, whereas global warming may further affect the functioning of phytoplankton at long-term scale. In the middle section of the large European Danube River, long-term decrease in phytoplankton biomass (Chl-a) and increase in species diversity have formerly been revealed. The functional community composition that relates to ecosystem functioning directly has not been addressed previously. We analyse a 34-year-long phytoplankton data set from the middle river section at God (N-Budapest), Hungary. We focus on gradual changes in the functional composition and functional diversity components based on the functional trait and functional group approaches. We hypothesised that long-term gradual changes in major environmental constraints should be followed by gradual shifts in dominance relationships among functional traits and functional groups of phytoplankton. We further hypothesised that functional shifts were highlighted by gradual changes in functional diversity components: evenness, divergence and dispersion. Water discharge of the middle Danube shifted towards the more frequent occurrence of lower values. On the other hand, high floods (>3,000m(3)/s) increased significantly with shortening tendency in duration and altered seasonality. The concentration of N and P forms, as well as total suspended solids decreased significantly. Water temperature increased significantly, especially in summer. In the phytoplankton, single-celled eutrophic centric diatoms decreased in relative abundance, but flagellated, elongated and filamentous forms increased. A clear functional shift was the dominance decrease in planktonic taxa and the relative abundance increase in benthic diatoms. All functional diversity components increased significantly in the entire data set, except functional evenness (FEVE) based on the functional group approach. At seasonal scale, all significant trends showed increases, except the FEVE components of the functional group approach, which decreased in winter and spring significantly. Long-term increase in functional diversity components alone could indicate enhanced ecosystem functioning of phytoplankton in the middle section of the Danube. However, we argue that the observed increase in functional diversity may be related to a gradual shift from high-biomass communities with the dominance of eutrophic centric diatoms towards the relative increase in several, but low-biomass elements. These include a few planktonic algae well adapted to the altered conditions, diatoms with benthic origin and dispersed limnophilic taxa. Our results provide the first evidence for a long-term phytoplankton functional regime shift in a European large river. Global warming, human impacts and oligotrophication might potentially increase the functional diversity of large river phytoplankton, but the origin and functional role of taxa should carefully be considered. The observed functional shift in phytoplankton might also be indicative for alterations in the food-web structure of the middle section of the Danube River at long-term scale.

J	Vrede, K				Vrede, K			Effects of inorganic nutrients and zooplankton on the growth of heterotrophic bacterioplankton-enclosure experiments in an oligotrophic clearwater lake	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Bacterioplankton production and abundance were studied in the oligotrophic clearwater Lake Njupfatet (Sweden) during 2 consecutive years (1989 and 1990). The lake was slightly acidic in 1989 and was Limed during the autumn-circulation period that year. In June of both years, experiments were carried out in 300 1 bags immersed in the lake. Amounts of inorganic nutrients (PO4 and NO3) and metazoan zooplankton in the bags were manipulated. In both years, additions of inorganic nutrients stimulated phytoplankton growth, and bacterial abundance, production and cell-specific production. Since phytoplankton growth was also stimulated, it cannot be concluded whether bacterioplankton growth was limited by inorganic nutrients alone or in combination with organic carbon provided by phytoplankton. The increase in bacterial biomass was smaller than expected based on the production measurements, especially in fertilized bags, indicating that there was strong grazing pressure on bacteria. In 1989, bacterial cell-specific production was enhanced by adding metazoan zooplankton, probably because zooplankton released nutrients that bacteria could utilize. Furthermore, the results indicate that the species composition of phytoplankton can affect the growth of bacterioplankton.																			0948-3055	1616-1564				AUG 9	1999	18	2					133	144		10.3354/ame018133	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame018133													WOS:000082124100003
J	Zhai, QM; Guo, ZY; Li, YL; Li, RQ				Zhai, Qiumin; Guo, Zhiyong; Li, Yongliang; Li, Rongquan			Annually laminated lake sediments and environmental changes in Bashang Plateau, North China	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Angulinuo Lake is the biggest lake on the Bashang Plateau, North China, and is 47.6 km(2) in area and 2-6 m in depth. A core from the inner part of Angulinuo Lake was sliced and the sediment was observed by Scanning Electronic Microscope (SEM). Annual laminations characterized by variable color and grain size were found and interpreted as recording the cyclic deposition of lacustrine clay and aeolian dust. The results of chemical analysis of coarse grains conducted by SEM-EDAX, and grain size analysis of modem aeolian dust in the ice on Angulinuo Lake, support an aeolian origin for the light coarse layers. Image analysis technique was used to calculate the size and number of coarse grains in each layer. The coarse grains were fractionated into four classes: > 42 mu m, 14-42 mu m, 14-4.2 mu m and 1.4-4.2 mu m. In general, the abundance of the four classes shows similar temporal variation patterns. Around Angulinuo Lake, the winter monsoon is strong and transports aeolian dust into the lake. When the winter monsoon is strong, the size and amount of coarse grains are expected to increase. We infer that the winter monsoon was weaker during 8430-5440 year BP, and was unstable in the later part of this period. From 5440 year BP, the winter monsoon became stronger, and then weaker from 3250 to 2490 year BP. During 2490-1170 year BP, the winter monsoon was slightly stronger, but since 1170 year BP, it has become weaker again. The changes of the winter monsoon intensity recorded in the annual laminations in Angulinuo Lake sediments correspond well to environmental changes in North China and to changes in sea level during the same period. Periods of weaker winter monsoon correspond to times of higher sea levels while the periods of stronger winter monsoon correspond to the Neoglaciation stage in China and the periods of lower sea levels.

J	Schabetsberger, R; Jersabek, CD				Schabetsberger, R; Jersabek, CD			Shallow males, deep females: sex-biased differences in habitat distribution of the freshwater calanoid copepod Arctodiaptomus alpinus	ECOGRAPHY												In a small, circular high-altitude karst lake situated in the northeastern calcareous Alps of Austria the copepod Arctodiaptomus alpinus (Imhof) develops each spring from resting eggs after the lake basin fills in early spring. After mid-summer, late developmental stages and adults concentrate in a thin layer near the sediment throughout the lake basin. During daytime an average 86% and 71% of female and male copepods respectively resided near the bottom. Males exhibited stronger diel vertical migrations than females and part of the population concentrated in near-surface water at night, but the majority of copepods remained at the sediment during darkness. Macro-photographs and core samples revealed that the proportion of epibenthic male A. alpinus decreased constantly from >70% in 3 m depth to <20% below the 8-m isobath. The proportion of ovigerous females increased with depth, whereas non-ovigerous females were comparatively more abundant in shallow water. Concurrently the highest frequencies of copulating copepods were detected in areas of high male density. Above the 3-m isobath male A. alpinus formed dense swarms in scattered patches of the macrophyte Ranunculus eradicatus (>93% males; maximum abundance: 362 600 individuals m(-2)). Adults and larvae of the alpine newt Triturus alpestris are the top predators in this fishless alpine lake, and A. alpinus constitutes a major component of their diet. However, predator densities and different predation rates on male and female copepods were not sufficient to explain the observed horizontal distribution of A. alpinus. We argue that the optimization of successful sexual encounters in copepods is the ultimate driving force behind this segregation of both sexes of A. alpinus ('mate encounter hypothesis').

J	Fields, JF; Dethier, DP				Fields, Jordan F.; Dethier, David P.			From on high: Geochemistry of alpine springs, Niwot Ridge, Colorado Front Range, USA	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Snowmelt-fed springs and small (0.5 km(2)) upland catchments in alpine areas of the western United States contribute significantly to the quantity and inorganic chemistry of water delivered to downstream basins but have not been studied extensively. Mineral weathering, transit time, and hydrologic mixing control the solute chemistry of waters that drain the upland zone of Niwot Ridge, Colorado Front Range, and adjacent areas in the granitic core of the Southern Rocky Mountains. Water in 37 springs sampled in this study flows in generally short steep paths (similar to 0.3 km) through shallow regolith with mean transit times (MTT) of weeks to months, producing solutions dominated by Si, Ca2+, Na+, and HCO3-, locally SO42-. Rock type is a significant control on spring, surface, and shallow groundwater chemistry, and plagioclase (oligoclase) is the major source of dissolved Na+ and Si. Concentrations of Ca2+ exceed stoichiometric predictions of oligoclase weathering by similar to 3.5x; excess Ca2+ likely represents weathering of aeolian material, vein calcite, or trace minerals. Concentrations of base cations and Si increase slowly with estimated MTT of 0.2 years for Niwot Ridge spring waters, and several years for shallow groundwater sampled by wells. Chemical weathering of silicate minerals is slow with estimated rates of similar to 2.0 and 0.2 pmol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1) for oligoclase and microcline, respectively; the most mineralized spring waters are saturated only with respect to kaolinite and montmorillonite. More than 50% of the dissolved base cations + Si measured in Boulder Creek at Orodell (similar to 25 km downstream) accumulate before water emerges from alpine springs on Niwot Ridge. Warming global temperatures are shifting more high-elevation precipitation to rain, potentially changing run-off patterns, transit time, and solute loads. Acquisition of solutes by alpine waters thus has implications far beyond small upland catchments.

J	NEWTON, SF				NEWTON, SF			BODY CONDITION OF A SMALL PASSERINE BIRD - ULTRASONIC ASSESSMENT AND SIGNIFICANCE IN OVERWINTER SURVIVAL	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The fitness benefits of intraspecific variation in physiological attributes have rarely been measured. Body condition, defined as the current status of metabolic reserves relative to likely demands, has often been implicated in subsequent survival, but has proved difficult to assess reliably in the live animal. A technique for assessing body condition, in terms of the main protein reserve of small birds, is presented. Pectoralis muscle thickness was measured in live birds using ultrasound reflection from the sternum. The relationship between the relative size of pectoralis muscles in autumn and the likelihood of overwinter survival in the dipper Cinclus cinclus was examined. The pectoralis reserves of male dippers surviving overwinter were significantly greater than those of birds which died or disappeared between late November and the breeding season in April. In contrast, variation in autumn condition of females was unrelated to overwinter survival.																			0952-8369					APR	1993	229		4				561	580		10.1111/j.1469-7998.1993.tb02657.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.1993.tb02657.x													WOS:A1993KY03000004

Outdoor mass concentrations of particles with aerodynamic diameters of less than 1, 2.5, and 10 mu m (PM1, PM2.5, and PM10, respectively) and indoor PM1 were measured with two light-scattering laser photometers set up near the largest and most visited Kozjak Lake. Our findings suggest that the particles mainly originated from background sources, although some came from local anthropogenic activities. More specifically, increases in both indoor and outdoor mass concentrations coincided with the increase in the number of visitors. Indoor PM1 concentrations also increased with increase in outdoor air temperature, while outdoor PMs exhibited U-shaped dependence (i.e., concentrations increased only at higher outdoor air temperatures). This behaviour and the decrease in the PM1/PM2.5 ratio with higher temperatures suggests that the production and growth of particles is influenced by photochemical reactions. The obtained spectra also pointed to a daily but not to weekly periodicity of PM levels.

The dynamics of abudnance and biomass is realized at the subpopulation level as a result of adaptation of subisolate specimens to certain spawning condition, embryonic and postembryonic development. Three phases of the state of subisolates have been found: depression, enhancement, and overpopulation. Each of the latter two phases lasts for six years, i.e. the complete lifetime of one generation. The data available suggests an essential impact of spawners density at the spawning grounds on the formation of a daughter generation number. The analysis of the long-term abundance dynamics of the reproductive part of subpopulations can only be used as reconnaissance, not giving a practical idea of the factors regulating and modifying their abundance.

Akita-Yakeyama Volcano: Part 2. Secular variations of SO4/Cl ratios and their relationship to the phreatic eruptions	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												More than 70 years observation of the SO42-/Cl- molar ratios of water from the Obuki hot spring in the vicinity of Mt. Akita-Yakeyama volcano indicated that the ratio started increasing rapidly from 1973, peaked in 1980 (SO42-/Cl- = 0.34), remained at high values for about 18 years, then gradually decreased and returned to a normal baseline value (0.14) in 1991. The volcano erupted near the summit in 1948-1957 and again in 1997. The 1980 peak of SO42-/Cl- ratios may reflect the 1948 phreatic eruption of the volcano. Similarly, high SO42-/Cl- ratios were also observed in 2013 lasting for two years. The SO42-/Cl- peak in 2013 appeared 16 years after the 1997 phreatic explosion. The delayed appearance of the SO42-/Cl- peaks may represent slow upward movement of reservoir water to the surface after input of magmatic SO2 into the fluid reservoir which produced HSO4- through disproportionation reaction. The slow movement of water is supported by a long subsurface residence time (13-25 years) of reservoir fluid estimated from tritium measurement of the Obuki hot spring water. One-dimensional channel model was applied to analyze the effect of volcanic activity on SO42-/Cl- ratios of the Obuki hot spring water. The model supported the long travel time of the fluid implying that the effects of the 1997 eruption may appear in the spring water chemistry after about 29 years later, i.e., around 2026.

J	Cai, B; Zeng, G; Zhang, GW; Li, ZX				Cai, Bo; Zeng, Gang; Zhang, Guwei; Li, Zhongxian			Autumn Cold Surge Paths over North China and the Associated Atmospheric Circulation	ATMOSPHERE												Using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model, we tracked the paths of 46 autumn cold surges affecting North China from 1961 to 2014, and classified them by clustering analysis, thereby investigating their changes and associated atmospheric circulation evolution. Our results indicate that autumn cold surges affecting North China can be classified into three types according to their paths: the north type, west type, and northwest type, with occurrences of 12, 16, and 18 respectively. Different types of cold surges have different atmospheric circulation characteristics. The north type is associated with a blocking type of atmospheric circulation pattern, with an enhanced stretching northeast ridge over the Ural Mountains and a transverse trough over Lake Baikal. However, the northwest type is characterized by a ridge-trough-ridge wave-train pattern that is located over the Barents Sea, West Siberian Plain, and Sakhalin Island, respectively. The west-type cold surge is related to a conversion type: a blocking system over the Ural Mountains forms four days before the cold surge occurrence, after which it becomes a wave-train type. The atmospheric signals detected prior to the occurrences of the three types of cold surges are also explored. The main signal of the north-path cold surges is that the energy propagates eastward from the Azores Islands to the Ural Mountains, and then forms a blocking high over the Urals. However, for the northwest-path cold surges, there is a weak trough over the Ural Mountains that gradually strengthens because the blocking high collapses over the Norwegian Sea. The key signal of the formation of the west-path cold surges is a blocking high over the Norwegian Sea's continuous enhancement and extension to Novaya Zemlya, which results in a transmission of energy to the Ural Mountains and leads to the formation of a blocking system over here. When the above-mentioned different types of atmospheric circulation characteristics appear, the type of cold surge path and its impact area can be potentially forecasted in advance, which may reduce the losses that result from cold surges.					; Zhang, Guwei/CAI-0239-2022; Zeng, Gang/IWM-2172-2023	zhang, guwei/0000-0001-8272-3007; 													2073-4433					MAR	2019	10	3							134	10.3390/atmos10030134	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos10030134													WOS:000465634600005

Weekly sampling revealed that the five most common species followed a trend which reflects the peculiar hydrological characteristics of the reservoir and their key position in the pelagic food web. In particular, 1991 was characterized by a strong water inflow which probably interfered with the reproductive activities of the dominant fish population (Rutilus rubilio) and reduced the concentration of inedible planktonic algae allowing the development of small Chlorococcales. This event was associated with higher population densities of Daphnia hyalina compared to the other years of the survey. In spring 1991, an extended clear-water phase was observed and Secchi disk depth increased to 6 m, whereas in the other years it did not surpass 1 m. In addition, the D. hyalina population persisted throughout the summer in 1991, whereas it started to decline at the end of June in the other years. This development of D. hyalina probably influenced the population dynamics of the other cladoceran species in the reservoir, and in particular reduced the summer growth of Diaphanosoma lacustris and delayed the occurrence of Bosmina longirostris. Stomach analysis indicated that D. hyalina is the preferred food item of juvenile (less than two months old) R. rubilio. Overall, the hydrology of the reservoir was observed to interact with the trophic processes in the pelagic environment of the ecosystem in at least two different ways: via bottom-up processes, influencing phytoplankton dynamics, and via top-down processes, regulating the predation efficiency of the planktivores.					; Naselli-Flores, Luigi/A-3824-2008	BARONE, Rossella/0000-0001-5777-0688; Naselli-Flores, Luigi/0000-0003-3748-3862													0018-8158	1573-5117				DEC 24	1997	360						223	232		10.1023/A:1003108919638	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003108919638													WOS:000073482200026
J	Oerter, EJ; Amundson, R				Oerter, Erik J.; Amundson, Ronald			Climate controls on spatial and temporal variations in the formation of pedogenic carbonate in the western Great Basin of North America	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Pedogenic carbonate is common in arid and semiarid soils, and though its stable C and O isotope composition has been shown to reflect local environmental conditions, questions remain about the quantitative nature of this relationship and the implications for paleoclimate applications. To further address these questions, a climosequence of four Holocene soils in Fish Lake Valley, Nevada (western United States), was instrumented and examined over the course of more than a year. The annual precipitation along the transect ranges from similar to 80 mm yr(-1) to similar to 220 mm yr(-1). Results show that the C and O stable isotope compositions of soil CO2, H2O, and carbonate change systematically with elevation and climate. However, there was considerable temporal variability in the conditions that affected carbonate isotope values. At the lowest elevation, CO2 delta C-13 and H2O delta O-18 values were similar to that in equilibrium with carbonate nearly year-round. At the midelevation sites, spring through summer CO2 delta C-13 and H2O delta O-18 values appeared to most closely match the delta C-13 and delta O-18 values of pedogenic carbonate. At the highest elevation, the C and O isotopes of carbonate did not reflect the soil CO2 delta C-13 and H2O delta O-18 values measured during the period of study, but they did appear to reflect soil respiration rates during the late spring. The transect shows that arid soil carbonate delta C-13 values strongly reflect variations in soil respiration rates and the resulting concentrations of soil CO2. These results also indicate that depth profile sampling may be required to adequately constrain respiration rates, which affect the interpreted atmospheric CO2 concentrations.					; Oerter, Erik/Q-2956-2019; Amundson, Ronald/E-2654-2015	Oerter, Erik/0000-0001-8816-1754; 													0016-7606	1943-2674				JUL	2016	128	7-8					1095	1104		10.1130/B31367.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B31367.1													WOS:000378636400003

Evidence for seasonal changes in population structure of Reed Buntings (Emberiza schoeniclus) in the Lake Neusiedl Region: a stable-isotope approach	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												Migrating species and populations are affected by conditions existing across large geographical scales. The degree to which populations mix at stop-over sites and wintering grounds is variable and can involve important fitness consequences. Thus, the link between breeding and wintering grounds and seasonal shifts in population structure are important to understand population demographics, local adaption and diversification patterns. This work aims to infer migration patterns and population connectivity in the Reed Bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus) community of a Ramsar-designated wetland, Lake Neusiedl, Seewinkel, Austria. Stable isotope markers (hydrogen, delta H-2, carbon, delta C-13) in feathers were analyzed to assign individuals to a specific breeding or natal area. Based on the geographic assignment, birds were compared with respect to their ecomorphological traits and their habitat selection (large reed bed versus more open habitat at shore of an alkaline lake) during winter to assess potential ecological differences and possibly associated morphological divergence. Stable isotope data revealed that the local Reed Bunting community undergoes seasonal changes in population structure. Three different populations that vary in their delta H-2 signature and to some extent in morphological characteristics as well as in delta C-13 values were identified. Indications for differential migration related to age and/or sex were additionally found, since males and females as well as first-year birds and adults showed remarkable differences in their traits and feather isotope values. delta H-2 values diverged significantly between these groups in both age and sex classes and birds with highest feather delta H-2 values were considered to represent the local breeding population at Lake Neusiedl and possibly also Reed Buntings from close surroundings. Moreover, this group had the highest delta C-13 values in first-year individuals as well as in adults. In both sex classes, the assignment of Reed Buntings to different populations was ultimately possible due to differences in bill shape with residents being characterized by more massive bills than individuals belonging to populations visiting the study area only during migration or for wintering. During winter, beak shape and feather delta H-2 and delta C-13 values differed significantly between birds caught in the reed stand of Lake Neusiedl and those captured near the salt pan, hence, indicating differential habitat selection among co-occurring populations during winter. These findings suggest that morphological attributes, such as bill shape and size as well as linked adaptations to different food sources play a decisive role for niche segregation among wintering populations. The results provide evidence that different populations mix during migration and during winter at Lake Neusiedl and the extent to which they are specialized to a specific habitat varied.					; Wanek, Wolfgang/E-7001-2012	Kofler, Barbara/0000-0002-6546-5832; Wanek, Wolfgang/0000-0003-2178-8258; Schulze, Christian H./0000-0002-2097-422X													2193-7192	2193-7206				APR	2021	162	2					421	433		10.1007/s10336-021-01855-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-021-01855-3		JAN 2021											WOS:000609968100001

The influence of larval growth rate on juvenile recruitment in Lake Erie walleye (Sander vitreus)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Growth-selective mortality as larvae can influence recruitment in marine fishes. Its importance in freshwater fishes, however, remains speculative. We quantified growth trajectories within annual cohorts (2011-2013) of Lake Erie walleye (Sander vitreus) and their relationship with recruitment. We hypothesized that selection against slow or fast growth would be associated with high mortality and poor recruitment, whereas weak or nonexistent growth-selective mortality co-occurring with fast growth would be associated with good recruitment. We used otoliths to reconstruct growth rates during the first 15 days of life from larvae collected during spring and juvenile recruits (survivors) collected during late summer. We documented growthselective mortality during 2011 and 2013, which exhibited poor recruitment as expected. During 2012, growth selection was absent, but growth was slow when compared to historical averages, resulting in poor recruitment. Growth was also considered slow in 2011 and 2013, due to multiple interacting conditions. Our study indicates that the relationship among larval growth, mortality, and future recruitment is complex, highlighting the need for continued research into how larval processes affect recruitment dynamics in freshwater fishes.

Considering the use of fertilizers along with land use change and urbanization, this increase in rainfall and snowmelt may cause severe erosion of land, accumulation of sediment in lakes and reservoirs, higher concentration of nutrients (nitrate and phosphorous), and disease-causing agents in inland and coastal waters. A study of Lake Ashtabula in North Dakota was carried out to confirm if there is a significant linkage of climate change and different land use with the increasing rate of sediment accumulation and nutrient production. For this purpose, the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) has been built up, calibrated, and validated for flow, sedimentation, and nutrient loads. The results show even in cold climate region, climate change may affect adversely the accumulation of sediment and nutrients in the lake.

Zooplankton-phytoplankton biomass and diversity relationships in the Great Lakes	PLOS ONE												Quantifying the relationship between phytoplankton and zooplankton may offer insight into zooplankton sensitivity to shifting phytoplankton assemblages and the potential impacts of producer-consumer decoupling on the rest of the food web. We analyzed 18 years (2001-2018) of paired phytoplankton and zooplankton samples collected as part of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Great Lakes Biology Monitoring Program to examine both the long-term and seasonal relationships between zooplankton and phytoplankton across all five Laurentian Great Lakes. We also analyzed effects of phytoplankton diversity on zooplankton biomass, diversity, and predator-prey (zooplanktivore/grazer) ratios. Across the Great Lakes, there was a weak positive correlation between total algal biovolume and zooplankton biomass in both spring and summer. The relationship was weaker and not consistently positive within individual lakes. These trends were consistent over time, providing no evidence of increasing decoupling over the study period. Zooplankton biomass was weakly negatively correlated with algal diversity across lakes, whereas zooplankton diversity was unaffected. These relationships did not change when we considered only the edible phytoplankton fraction, possibly due to the high correlation between total and edible phytoplankton biovolume in most of these lakes. Lack of strong coupling between these producer and consumer assemblages may be related to lagging responses by the consumers, top-down effects from higher-level consumers, or other confounding factors. These results underscore the difficulty in predicting higher trophic level responses, including zooplankton, from changes in phytoplankton assemblages.

The Pileus project: Climatic impacts on sour cherry production in the Great Lakes region in past and projected future time frames	PROCEEDINGS OF THE VIITH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MODELLING IN FRUIT RESEARCH AND ORCHARD MANAGEMENT	Acta Horticulturae				7th International Symposium on Modelling in Fruit Research and Orchard Management	JUN 20-24, 2004	Copenhagen, DENMARK	Int Soc Hort Sci, Royal Vet & Agr Univ, Tofte Jakobsen Legat				A temperature-based model simulating the growth and development of sour cherry (Prunus cerasus L.) was developed to determine the impacts of climate in past and potential future time trends. Phenological development from 'side green' through 'petal fall' stages is driven in the model by daily growing degree-day accumulation from January 1 with an empirical function developed from detailed observations collected in 1994, and 1995 from two locations in western Lower Michigan, and from one location in Northwest Michigan (1994 only). The model was validated with phenological observations from major production areas of western Lower Michigan for the period 1976-2003. Following validation, historical weather data series from Lower Michigan were used to simulate phenological developmental stages for the period 1930-2000. Output from the model suggests that initial phenological development tended to occur relatively earlier in the season in recent decades of this period. Since early phenological development is also associated with greater susceptibility to cold injury, the simulations also suggested an increased probability of spring bud damage, especially during the past 20-30 years. Plausible climate scenarios of future climatic conditions were developed from three separate general circulation models, which allowed projections of phenological development rates through the year 2100.																			0567-7572	2406-6168	90-6605-460-3				2006		707					101	+		10.17660/ActaHortic.2006.707.12	http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2006.707.12													WOS:000239370200012
J	Plaska, W; Mieczan, T				Plaska, Wojciech; Mieczan, Tomasz			Effects of water bugs on crustacean zooplankton in a shallow littoral zone	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												Interactions within the food chain are essential to ecosystem ecology. At the same time, very little is known of the trophic relationships between Heteroptera and zooplankton. The aim of this study was to examine the community structure of water bugs in the littoral zone of shallow lakes and their impact on crustacean zooplankton communities. A study on the effect of Heteroptera on zooplankton communities was carried out in the conditions of a laboratory experiment with two treatments: (1) aquariums in which the Heteroptera species Ilyocoris cimicoides and Plea minutissima were present (control treatment) and (2) aquariums from which Heteroptera were removed (removal treatment). The decisive factor in reducing the number of crustacean zooplankton was most likely the presence of predatory Heteroptera in a composition typical of the shallow littoral of eutrophic lakes. Their impact is reflected in both a decrease in the species richness and abundance of crustaceans and a transformation of the size structure of the zooplankton. The results of the study are the first to suggest a substantial seasonal impact of water bugs on crustacean zooplankton in a shallow lake. The results of the experiments confirm that predatory Heteroptera exert considerable pressure on crustacean zooplankton during the spring and summer peaks in abundance.

J	LANDRUM, PF; POORE, R				LANDRUM, PF; POORE, R			TOXICOKINETICS OF SELECTED XENOBIOTICS IN HEXAGENIA-LIMBATA	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Understanding the role of benthos in the fate and transport of contaminants requires understanding the toxicokinetics of those organisms for both waterborne and sediment-associated compounds. This effort focused on the toxicokinetics of Hexagenia limbata as an important component of the benthic community of the upper Great Lakes connecting channels. The accumulation and elimination of two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon congeners and a hexachlorobiphenyl isomer were followed over the course of a season in H. limbata collected from Lake St. Clair. Both the water uptake clearance and elimination rate constants increased with increasing temperature through the spring and summer. The elimination constants were relatively large. The uptake constant for sediment-associated compounds was essentially constant the two times it was measured and was large compared to sediment accumulation by Pontoporeia hoyi. Steady state model calculations indicate that the amount of compound in H.limbata should decline as temperature increases. The BCF values on a lipid content normalized basis remain relatively constant for both PAHs and show some change with season for hexachlorobiphenyl. Based on the best estimates of environmental concentration of the contaminants studied in both sediment and water, the model suggest that H. limbata should obtain greater than 90% of its contaminant body burden from the sediment-associated pollutants.																			0380-1330						1988	14	4					427	437		10.1016/S0380-1330(88)71576-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(88)71576-2													WOS:A1988R673900008

The shrinkage of surface water, especially the degradation of lakes and their adjacent wetlands in drylands, may lead to the emergence of new salt dust storm hotspots, which causes greater danger. In this paper, based on high spatial resolution global surface water (GSW) and multiangle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) AOD data, we systematically analyze the dynamic characteristics of surface water and aerosols in typical drylands (Central Asia, CA) between 2000 and 2018. Simultaneously, combined with auxiliary environment vari-ables, we explore the driving mechanisms of surface water on the regional salt/sand aerosols on different spatial scales. The results show that the seasonal surface water features an increasing trend, especially a more dramatic increase after 2015, and the permanent surface water indicates an overall decrease, with nearly 54.367 % at risk of receding and drying up. In typical lakes (Aral Sea and Ebinur Lake), the inter-annual change feature of the surface water area (WA) is that a continuous decrease during the study per-iod occurs in Aral Sea area, yet a significant improvement has occurred in Ebinur Lake after 2015, and the degradation of Ebinur Lake takes place later and its recovery earlier than Aral Sea. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) in CA shows obvious seasonal variation, with the largest in spring (0.192 +/- 0173), next in summer (0.169 +/- 0.106), and the smallest in autumn (0.123 +/- 0.065). The interannual variation of AOD exhibits an increase from 2000 to 2018 in CA, with high AOD areas mainly concentrated in the Taklamakan Desert and some lake beds resulting from lake degradation, including Aral Sea and Ebinur Lake. The AOD holds a similar trend between Aral Sea and Ebinur Lake on an interannual scale. And the AOD over Ebinur Lake is lower than that over Aral Sea in magnitude and lags behind in reaching the peak compared with Aral Sea. The WA change can significantly affect aerosol variation directly or indirectly on the aerosol load or mode size, but there are obvious differences in the driving mechanisms, acting paths, and influence magnitude of WA on aerosols on different spatial scales. In addition, the increase of WA can significantly directly suppress the increase of Angstrom exponent (AE), and the effects of WA on AOD are realized majorly by an indirect approach. From the typical lake perspective, the effects of WA on aerosol in Aral Sea are achieved via an indirect path; and the decrease of WA can indirectly pro-mote the AOD rise, and directly stimulate the AE growth in Ebinur Lake.(c) 2022 China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.

J	Mieczan, T				Mieczan, Tomasz			VERTICAL MICROZONATION OF TESTATE AMOEBAE AND CILIATES IN PEATBOG WATERS IN RELATION TO PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PARAMETERS	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Peatbogs have both horizontal and vertical differences in moisture, pH, light and nutrient availability. Micro-distribution of testate amoebae taxa has been observed along the Sphagnum stem but there is no data concerning the vertical micro-distribution of protozoa in water column under the peatbog surface and in the interstitial waters. The research was made in a small (ca 16 ha) peatbog complex in the eastern Poland. Vertical microzonation of testate amoebae and ciliates in relation to physical, chemical and biological parameters (peat porosity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, TN, TP, DOC and TOC) in Sphagnum hollows, mud bottom hollows and interstitial waters in peatbog were studied. Samples were taken once a month from April to November 2009 from three layers: free water mass up to 10 cm (FW), bottom water (BW) and interstitial, pore water - IW (water between particles of peat on depth 20-25 cm). During each sampling occasion 3 samples were collected from each site. At each type of micro-habitat and each sampling date water was sampled using a plexiglass core. The water column sampled from the top surface to the bottom was 25 cm high. Interstitial waters were collected from mini-piezometers located into the peat. Temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, chlorophyll a and nutrients contents were always lower in interstitial water than in free and bottom waters. The highest numbers of testate amoebae and ciliates taxa occurred in the bottom water (31 and 13 taxa, respectively) and became much lower in interstitial water (17 and 5 taxa, respectively). The density and biomass of protozoa differed significantly between the studied layers, with the lowest numbers in the interstitial water and the highest in the bottom water. Ordination analysis indicated that chlorophyll a, TOC and TP can strongly regulate the abundance and species composition of protozoa. The RDA ordination showed that the testate amoebae species can be divided into three groups associated with: 1) free water mass, 2) bottom water and 3) interstitial water, while the ciliate species into two groups associated with: 1) interstitial water and 2) free water mass and bottom waters. The free water mass and bottom water were dominated by mixotrophic taxa, whereas the deepest layer showed the increase of the contribution of small, bacterivorous species. In all the examined micro-habitats the highest abundance and biomass of these microorganisms occurred in early spring and late autumn, while the lowest values were recorded in late summer.

Effect of temperature on phosphorus flux from anoxic western Lake From sediments	WATER RESEARCH												The western basin of Lake Erie experiences annual Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), which degrade water quality, threaten drinking water supplies, and deter recreation. The size of HABs in Lake Erie is highly correlated with the external loading of phosphorus (P) from a major tributary, the Maumee River, during spring and summer months. Because HAB size is largely explained by external loading, the contribution of P from lake sediments (internal loading) is considered to be minimal. However, if lake sediments become warmer and more hypoxic or anoxic in response to climate change, the relative contribution of internal P loading from sediments may become greater. In this study, we examined the potential effect of elevated lake temperatures on internal loading of P under anoxic conditions. Sediment cores were collected during Summer 2014 from 4 locations in the western basin of Lake Erie ranging from highly productive areas near Maumee Bay to less productive offshore areas. Cores were incubated for 4 days under anoxic conditions under different temperatures (10 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and 30 degrees C). P flux varied greatly between temperature treatments and sites. Average P flux at 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C were 2 and 14 times higher respectively, than for cores incubated at 10 degrees C. The site closest to the mouth of the Maumee River had the highest P flux, 10 times higher than the furthest site, and highest total P concentration in the surface sediment, 2 times higher than the furthest site, suggesting a gradient of sediment P characteristics associated with the Maumee River plume. Extrapolating these fluxes across the western basin suggests that with four days of anoxia at 30 degrees C, lake sediments could contribute similar to 415 metric tons of dissolved P, which is equivalent to the springtime dissolved P, loading from the Maumee River for 2011, the second-largest HAB on record.

Summer air temperature reconstruction was performed using transfer functions based on the Swiss (Sw-TF) and the merged Norwegian-Swiss calibration data set (NS-TF). Our results suggest that summer air temperatures increased rapidly from the onset of the early Holocene onwards (ca. 11,500-10,200cal. yr BP), reaching close to present July air temperatures (11.2 degrees C). Between ca. 10,200 and 8500cal. yr BP mean reconstructed temperatures increased further by 1.5-2.0 degrees C. Later on, from ca. 8500cal. yr BP, chironomid-based summer temperatures started to decrease, although mean values were still above present-day temperatures. The next time period (ca. 6000-3000cal. yr BP) was cooler and with less variable temperature conditions than earlier. Afterwards (ca. 3000-2000cal. yr BP), a sharp decrease occurred in inferred temperatures with values under present-day conditions by 1.8 degrees C. Finally, in the last 2000years, reconstructed temperatures showed again an increasing trend at Lake Brazi. Short-term temperature declines of 0.6-1.2 degrees C were observed between ca. 10,350-10,190, 9750-9500, 8700-8500, 7600-7300, 7100-6900 and 4400-4000cal. yr BP. These temperature declines are, however, within the estimated error of prediction of the chironomid-based inferences. Generally, our reconstructed temperatures complied with the summer insolation curve at 45 degrees N, with other proxy-records (i.e. pollen and diatoms) from the same sediment and with other records from the Carpathians and from Western Europe.

However, studies of the lake effect in the high-altitude Tibetan Plateau (TP) rarely have been performed until recently, and little attention has been paid to modelling of frozen lakes. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF v. 3.6.1) is employed to conduct three numerical experiments in the Ngoring Lake Basin (the original experiment, an experiment with a tuned model, and a no-lake experiment) to investigate the influences of parameter optimization on the lake simulation and of the high-altitude lake on the regional climate. After the lake depth, the roughness lengths, and initial surface temperature are corrected in the model, the simulation of the air temperature is distinctly improved. In the experiment using a tuned model, the simulated sensible-heat flux (H) is clearly improved, especially during periods of ice melting (from late spring to early summer) and freezing (late fall). The improvement of latent-heat flux (LE) is mainly manifested by the sharp increase in the correlation coefficient between simulation and observation, whereas the improvement in the average value is small. The optimization of initial surface temperature shows the most prominent effect in the first year and distinctly weakens after a freezing period. After the lakes become grassland in the model, the daytime temperature clearly increases during the freezing and melting periods; but the nocturnal cooling appears in other stages, especially from September to October. The annual mean H increases by 6.4 times in the regions of the Ngoring Lake and the Gyaring Lake, and the LE declines by 56.2%. The sum of H and LE increases from 71.2 W/m(2) (with lake) to 84.6 W/m(2) (no lake). For the entire simulation region, the sum of H and LE also increases slightly. After the lakes are removed, the air temperature increases significantly from June to September over the area corresponding to the two lakes, and an abnormal convergence field appears; at the same time, the precipitation clearly increases over the two lakes and surrounding areas.

Changes in population size under different fire regimes were estimated, based on measurement of post-fire seedling emergence, seedling survival, survival and seed production in established plants of differing ages, survival of seeds held in serotinous cones and seed-release in the periods between fire. Seeds were first available at 5 years in P. pulchella and 6 years in B. ericifolia. Exact replacement would be possible when burnt at these ages, if seedling establishment were very high. Low establishment would delay replacement to 13 years of age in both species. Lake summer/autumn fires of high intensity favour high establishment. Such fires at 8-10 year intervals would be tolerated without any sustained decline in numbers. Fires at 10-15 year intervals could occur regardless of season or intensity with little risk of a population decline. Large increases in numbers and density would follow fires spaced at 10-30 years. Enough seeds would be available for replacement up to about 50 years in both species. Viable seed-release in unburnt conditions was sufficient to compensate for deaths in stands over 20 years old, even with very low levels of establishment. Two variables accounted for the biggest changes in numbers and density between generations interspersed by fires; namely the age at which a stand is burned and the proportion of seeds which emerge as seedlings. A comparison with other similar species showed similarities in controls on emergence and establishment, lengths of primary juvenile periods and life spans.																			0307-692X					DEC	1988	13	4					505	518		10.1111/j.1442-9993.1988.tb00999.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.1988.tb00999.x													WOS:A1988R450900015

Long-term evolution of winter habitats in Poyang Lake derived from satellite imagery using machine learning methods	FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE												Poyang Lake is a freshwater lake in China which is a vital winter habitat for many kinds of wildlife and a critical component of the regional ecology. Here, we use Landsat satellite imagery to systematically assess habitat characteristic changes from 1990 to 2021. Four machine learning methods including random forest (RF), gradient boosting tree (GBT), support vector machine (SVM) and classification and regression trees (CART) are analyzed by comparing the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficients. The results show that the accuracy of random forest is higher than that of the other three machine learning methods. The long-term characteristics of Poyang Lake winter habitat types are extracted from Landsat satellite images using the RF method. These results show that the mudflat area was larger than water surface and sand. After 2012, more mudflat area had been converted into grassland, which is related to the early onset of the winter dry season in the Poyang Lake area. The habitats were scattered and fragmented from 1990 to 1998; after 1997-1998, however, the degree of landscape patch density and interference decreased, indicating a decreased impact of human-related interference and natural factors on the evolution of habitats in and around Poyang Lake.																			2095-0195	2095-0209				MAR	2025	19	1					41	53		10.1007/s11707-022-1052-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-022-1052-8		JUN 2023											WOS:001005840600002

The magmatic signature of gases rising to the surface is attested by their high CO2 contents (delta C-13(CO2) = -3.6 +/- 1.3 %), and relatively high He-3/He-4 ratios (6.0 +/- 0.9 R-A), with a CO2/He-3 ratio typical for the Central American Arc (2.3 x 10(10) -6.9 x 10(11)). Such magmatic signature is practically identical for the near-summit fumaroles, and the bubbling gases at the base of Tacana edifice. Besides the HCO3-enrichment in thermal spring waters, the springs (pH 5.8-6.7) show a SO4-and minor Cl-enrichment: a CO2 and H2S + SO2-rich magmatic steam condenses into a deeper geothermal aquifer, and the resulting hydrothermal fluid mixes with meteoric waters near the surface. The recharge area for the thermal springs is located at higher elevations (> 400 m higher than spring outlet elevation), as inferred from the delta D-delta O-18 data for rivers, thermal and cold springs. These general insights of the Tacana volcano-hydrothermal system serve as the baseline for future volcanic surveillance, and geothermal prospection. The main locus of hydrothermal activity is located inside the Tacana horseshoe-shaped crater in the northwestern sector of the volcanic edifice. In terms of volcanic hazard, this sector can be considered the most probable site for future phreatic activity.

Anouk; Ricciardi, Anthony			Distribution, abundance and condition of an invasive bivalve (Corbicula fluminea) along an artificial thermal gradient in the St. Lawrence River	AQUATIC INVASIONS												The Asian clam Corbicula fluminea has been introduced to lakes and rivers worldwide, but its physiological requirements generally restrict its distribution to water temperatures of >= 2 degrees C. In north temperate areas of North America, C. fluminea therefore occurs primarily in artificially heated waterbodies. In November 2009, C. fluminea was discovered for the first time in the St. Lawrence River within the thermal discharge plume of the Gentilly-2 nuclear power plant, in which the species had developed an abundant and persistent population. In summer 2011, the distribution, abundance and body condition of C. fluminea were sampled in sections of the river immediately upstream and for several kilometres downstream of the power plant. The thermal plume extended as far downstream as 4 km, and C. fluminea's population density declined along this distance. A generalized linear mixed model indicated that C. fluminea's local population density was related negatively to water depth and positively to temperature, turbidity and flow velocity, with temperature having the greatest influence. At stations closer to the discharge source, clams were larger and had a higher mean body condition. However, when temperatures exceeded 30 degrees C in the discharge canal during midsummer, body condition was maximal outside the canal at 1.5 km downstream of the discharge source. Thus, although the plume provided a winter thermal refuge for C. fluminea, it created a temperature gradient that encompassed both the upper and lower tolerance limits of the species. The C. fluminea population was extirpated during the winter months when normal temperatures were re-established following permanent cessation of power plant activity in December 2012.					; Castañeda, Rowshyra/O-2619-2015; Ricciardi, Anthony/A-8536-2010	Ricciardi, Anthony/0000-0003-1492-0054; Castaneda, Rowshyra Ashley/0000-0002-8484-1143; 													1798-6540	1818-5487				SEP	2018	13	3					379	392		10.3391/ai.2018.13.3.06	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/ai.2018.13.3.06													WOS:000452049600006

In this naturally eutrophic, hypoxic and periodically anoxic lake, an investigation of the microplankton community was performed during the 1995-1998 period when the ecology of the lake was greatly influenced by strong stratification and the appearance of anoxic conditions in the entire water column. The microplankton community (maximum abundance 1.06 x 10(7) cells L(-1)) was composed of 40 taxa, mainly diatoms (62.5%) and dinoflagellates. (29%). The research provided evidence of exceptionally dense populations and the seasonally-recurrent appearance of two rare microflagellates: Prorocentrum arcuatum Issel (dinoflagellate) and Hermesinum adriaticum Zacharias (heterotrophic microflagellate). The development of H. adriaticum and P. arcuatum mostly increased during the summer under conditions of nitrate deficiency, while the co-dominant diatom Chaetoceros curvisetus Cleve appeared during the spring when higher nitrate concentrations were present. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) indicated the importance of temperature, oxygen, silicate and nitrate on the incidence of these dominant species. The investigation of these microflagellates has allowed for the gaining of insight into their ecophysiological characteristics as well as the monitoring of their distribution in the Mediterranean, which has possibly expanded due to climate changes.					ciglenecki, irena/N-8792-2013; Cetinic, Ivona/Q-6281-2019	Cetinic, Ivona/0000-0002-1363-3136; Ciglenecki, Irena/0000-0002-1873-6193													0001-5113					JUN	2009	50	1					31	43																WOS:000279779600004
J	Mattheus, CR				Mattheus, Christopher R.			Climate-Induced Changes in Rates of Headland-Beach Progradation along the Southern Coast of Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Isolated portions of the sediment-starved U.S. Lake Erie coast have prograded over the last 100 years in response to littoral drift disruption by hard-structure installation. Published nautical charts offer insight into decadal-scale sediment dynamics operating around this erosional coastline's progracling headland beaches. Nearshore-surface models constructed from historical bathymetry data sets show that headland-beach progradation occurs with little change in shoreface-profile shape; beach-area gain therefore provides a metric for sediment-volume change. A time-series analysis of beach growth, lake level, drought occurrence, and winter-ice cover suggests that headland geomorphology is partly climate driven. Decreased rates of beach progradation experienced along studied headlands between the late 1930s and early 1950s followed extreme drought conditions, exceptionally low lake levels, and low winter-ice covers. Reduced sediment supply to headland beaches is inferred by hampered bluff erosion during periods of low lake level, affiliated with less direct wave impact on bluffs, and drought conditions, associated with reduced groundwater-related mass wasting of bluffs. Similar drought and low-lake-level conditions existed throughout the 1960s; however, this period experienced high winter-ice covers and was unaffiliated with a change in headland-beach progradation rate, likely due to diminished sediment losses from adjacent nearshore regions during winter seasons. Reduced bluff erosion of the 1930s was induced by a combination of low lake levels and drought conditions and, along with nearshore-sediment losses in absence of winter-ice cover, stunted headland-beach growth during the subsequent period of lake-level rise. A decadal delay of headland-shoreline response to these climate extremes attests to the nearshore system's poor buffering capacity to environmental changes altering sediment availability.																			0749-0208	1551-5036				JUL	2014	30	4					743	755		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-13-00156.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-13-00156.1													WOS:000339366800008

Although it is important to accurately assess CO2 emission flux in a catchment, little research has been carried out to investigate the spatio-temporal variations in CO2 emissions in view of a water continuum. Here, we systematically compared the differences and control factors of CO2 degassing across the water-air interface of a spring-river-lake continuum in the discharge area of Baotuquan Spring in July 2017, which is a typical temperate karst spring area in Jinan city, northern China, using hydrogeochemical parameters, stable carbon isotope values, and CO2 degassing flux. Affected by the pCO(2) concentration gradient between the water and ambient air, the spring water showed a high CO2 degassing flux (166.19 & PLUSMN; 91.91 mmol/(m(2) d)). After the spring outlet, the CO2 degassing flux in the spring-fed river showed a slight increase (181.05 & PLUSMN; 155.61 mmol/(m(2) d)) due to river flow rate disturbance. The river flow rate was significantly reduced by the "blockage" of the lake, which promoted the survival and reproduction of phytoplankton and provided favorable conditions for aquatic plant photosynthesis, increasing the plankton biomass in the lake to 3383.79 x 10(4)/L. In addition, the significant decrease in the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration and the increase in the & delta;C-13(DIC) values in the lake also indicated that the photosynthesis of the lake's aquatic plants resulted in a significant decrease in the pCO(2) concentration, thus limiting the amount of CO2 off-gassing (90.56 & PLUSMN; 55.03 mmol/(m(2) d)).

J	Fujiwara, K				Fujiwara, Koh-ichi			Delay of budding and growth inhibition of the reed Phragmites australis caused by reaping of withered stems and submergence of the cut ends	NIPPON SUISAN GAKKAISHI												The influence of winter reaping of withered stems of the reed Phragmites australis on their budding and growth was examined in Lake Biwa. When the cut ends of withered stems were flooded in spring, growth of new shoots was inhibited probably because of limited oxygen supply to the rhizomes. As an adaptation, the reeds rapidly extended shoots to the water surface to obtain oxygen. However, it was thought that this adaptation would not function easily in natural lake areas because these shoots were easily damaged by wind and waves. On the other hand, it was confirmed that withered stems have a function to protect new shoots from wind and waves. Furthermore, the importance of the humus originating from the litter of reeds was confirmed for the budding and growth of the reeds. Thus, it was concluded that the withered stems should not be reaped in areas where submergence is expected at the time of budding.																			0021-5392	1349-998X				NOV	2012	78	6					1159	1169		10.2331/suisan.78.1159	http://dx.doi.org/10.2331/suisan.78.1159													WOS:000314008100007
J	Kramer, BJ; Gobler, CJ				Kramer, Benjamin J.; Gobler, Christopher J.			Simulated heat waves promote the growth but suppress the N2 fixation rates of Dolichospermum spp. and cyanobacterial communities in temperate lakes	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The intensity and duration of heat waves are expected to increase this century, occurrences considered favorable for harmful, bloom-forming freshwater cyanobacteria. Dinitrogen (N2) fixation is a major component of nitrogen cycling in freshwater systems, yet little is known with respect to how diazotrophic (N2 fixing) cyanobacteria respond to heat waves. Here, we quantified the effects of elevated temperature and fixed N enrichment on the growth and N2 fixation rates of Dolichospermum isolates from differing latitudes and cyanobacterial communities in four lakes across New York state, USA, during the summer and early fall. In culture experiments, temperatures >= 26 degrees C significantly reduced maximum growth rates of the sub-polar Dolichospermum strains from Finland relative to those grown at 20-25 degrees C, while a strain of Dolichospermum isolated from subtropical Australia grew significantly faster at 20- 30 degrees C compared to cooler temperatures. All strains, however, exhibited significantly lower N2 fixation rates at higher temperatures (29 - 30 degrees C) relative to lower temperatures (13-26 degrees C). During ecosystem-based experiments with cyanobacterial communities comprised of Nostocales and other diazotrophic cyanobacteria, short-term (3-4 day) exposures to elevated temperatures mimicking heat waves (+3-6 degrees C; 27-31 degrees C) and/or N (NH4+) enrichment caused a significant increase in cyanobacterial net growth rates but also caused a significant decline in N-2 fixation rates. Collectively, results indicate that while heat waves and fixed N loading can promote cyanobacterial communities, they also suppress diazotrophy, which is generally regarded as a significant component of nitrogen cycling in eutrophic freshwater systems. Such reductions in N2 fixation would promote or intensify N limitation of primary production in lakes during the summer, an outcome that would be exacerbated under future warming scenarios.					; Gobler, Christopher/JOZ-2924-2023	Kramer, Benjamin/0000-0003-4406-8085; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				MAR	2023	147								109983	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.109983	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.109983		FEB 2023											WOS:000946728800001

The analyses showed that the lake water contain ample nutrients (TAN: 3.6-16; TDP: 4.88-20.38 and NO3-N: 0.3-19.63 mg L-1) to support microalgal growth, with an average biomass concentration of approximate to 2.0 g L-1, throughout the year. Significant correlation (p < 0.05) was observed between microalgal biomass and nutrient concentration in the lake water. Further, co-digestion studies in the pilot-scale plant (0.5 m(3)) showed good performance with a volumetric and specific biogas yield in the range of 0.45 to 0.65 m(3) day(-1)and 0.72 to 1.04 m(3) kg(-1)VS(fed)day(-1)respectively, during the summer. However, during winters, the volumetric and specific biogas yield were found to be in the range of 0.06 and 0.21 m(3) day(-1)and 0.096-0.336 m(3) kg(-1)VS(fed)day(-1), respectively, with an average 55-65% CH4. Detailed analyses of digestate indicated long-term stability of the pilot-scale process.

In the last two decades, the rapid disappear of macrophyte beds in the floodplain lakes of the middle lower Yangtze River has become a great concern for the ecological security of the region. This study aims to quantify the effects of water depth on biomass production and clonal (i.e. stolons and winter buds) and sexual reproduction (i.e. fruits) of Vallisneria natans, a cosmopolitan, perennial submergent species. Results of the research clearly demonstrated the unimodal relationship between biomass production and water depth, and there was an optimal range of 35-50 cm, beyond which total biomass decreased. Also, both clonal and sexual reproductive outputs decreased with water depth. Furthermore, for the first time, the study revealed the distinct reproduction patterns of the individuals originated from seeds and clonal propagules. While seed generated plants produced significantly more fruits (and no winter buds), plants developed from clonal propagules produced more stolons and winter buds. There findings plead further researches on V. natans seedling establishment and reproductive ecology because of the importance of winter buds as food for wintering waterbirds in the middle Yangtze floodplains.

Understanding recharging processes for DWLW is a key step for better protection of the oasis, but poorly studied. To this end, we carried out a comprehensive water chemistry and isotope sampling and analysis, by taking the oasis and its water sources as a complete system to reveal the oasis water recharging mechanism and flow paths. Water samples, including mountain snowmelt water, river water, groundwater, spring and lake water, were collected within and around the DWLW, and their environmental isotopes (delta O-18 and delta D) and water chemistry were analysed. Results showed that the stable isotope values exhibited strong spatial variations, ranging from -90.69 parts per thousand to -42.45 parts per thousand for dD and from -13.81 parts per thousand to -2.90 parts per thousand for delta O-18. The isotope values were extremely depleted for snowmelt water, followed by river water, groundwater, spring water, and were most enriched in lake water. The difference in isotopic values from the different water bodies indicates that seasonal rivers primarily originate from the snowmelt water in the adjacent mountains, discharge into the aquifer through infiltration, then groundwater rises up by forms of springs to the lake oases, the river and groundwater interacted frequently, causing significant changes in solute in different positions. The ion concentrations accumulated continuously along the flow path, the total dissolved solid content varied from 416 mg/L in river water to 20360 mg/L in lake water, and the dominant anion facies changed systematically from HCO3- to SO42- then Cl-. The ionic ration plot, chlor-alkali index and saturation index demonstrated that dissolution of minerals plays a major role in the change in chemical composition, and other processes such as carbonate precipitation associated with cation exchange reaction also influence the chemical composition. Our results are helpful for understanding the hydrological and hydrochemical processes in arid groundwater-fed oases, and can be also useful for rational management and assessment of regional-scale groundwater resources in oases.

J	Pope, KL; Matthews, KR				Pope, KL; Matthews, KR			Influence of anuran prey on the condition and distribution of Rana muscosa in the Sierra Nevada	HERPETOLOGICA												Mountain yellow-legged frogs (Rana muscosa) at high elevations of the Sierra Nevada must obtain enough food during summer to survive 7-9 winter months when their aquatic habitats are frozen and food is presumably unavailable. Adults of R. muscosa prey of a variety of organisms, including aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates and anuran larvae. To determine if anuran larvae influence the condition, distribution, and survival of adults of R. muscosa we assessed body condition (variation from the expected mass for given length) and distribution of R. muscosa in relation to abundance and distribution of larval Hyla regilla, Bufo canorus, and Bufo boreas. Using three years of mark-recapture data, we found that abundance of larval H. regilla in a water body was positively correlated with the condition of R. muscosa. Moreover, R. muscosa had higher relative mass (W-r) values in areas with other anuran larvae than in areas with no other amphibian species. High W-r values significantly increased the probability of recapturing frogs in following years. Using surveys of over 1700 lakes and ponds in the John Muir Wilderness and Kings Canyon National Park, we also found that the presence of larval H. regilla or Bufo in a water body was a significant indicator of the presence of adults of R. muscosa after accounting for significant habitat and isolation variables. These findings taken together suggest that some adults of R. muscosa actively seek out water bodies with other anuran species during the critical summer months and that he anuran larvae provide a nutritious food source that increases the body condition and, therefore, survival of the frogs.

Currently, estimates of drought variability over the past several thousand years are based largely on tree-ring records. We produced a 1,500-y record of winter precipitation in the Pacific Northwest using a physical model-based analysis of lake sediment oxygen isotope data. Our results indicate that during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) (900-1300 AD) the Pacific Northwest experienced exceptional wetness in winter and that during the Little Ice Age (LIA) (1450-1850 AD) conditions were drier, contrasting with hydroclimatic anomalies in the desert Southwest and consistent with climate dynamics related to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). These findings are somewhat discordant with drought records from tree rings, suggesting that differences in seasonal sensitivity between the two proxies allow a more compete understanding of the climate system and likely explain disparities in inferred climate trends over centennial timescales.

Chemical signatures were used to identify CH4 sources from tailings ponds (BTEX VOCs), open pit surface mines (NOy and r BC) and elevated plumes from bitumen upgrading facilities (SO2 and NOy). Emission rates of CH4 were determined for the five primary surface mining facilities in the region using two mass-balance methods. Emission rates from source categories within each facility were estimated when plumes from the sources were spatially separable. Tailings ponds accounted for 45% of total CH4 emissions measured from the major surface mining facilities in the region, while emissions from operations in the open pit mines accounted for +/- 50 %. The average open pit surface mining emission rates ranged from 1.2 to 2.8 t of CH4 h(-1) for different facilities in the AOSR. Amongst the 19 tailings ponds, Mildred Lake Settling Basin, the oldest pond in the region, was found to be responsible for the majority of tailings ponds emissions of CH4 (> 70 %). The sum of measured emission rates of CH4 from the five major facilities, 19.2 +/- 1.1 tCH(4) h(-1), was similar to a single mass-balance determination of CH4 from all major sources in the AOSR determined from a single flight downwind of the facilities, 23.7 +/- 3.7 tCH(4) h(-1). The measured hourly CH4 emission rate from all facilities in the AOSR is 48 +/- 8% higher than that extracted for 2013 from the Canadian Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, a legislated facility-reported emissions inventory, converted to hourly units. The measured emissions correspond to an emissions rate of 0.17 +/- 0.01 TgCH(4) yr(-1) if the emissions are assumed as temporally constant, which is an uncertain assumption. The emission rates reported here are relevant for the summer season. In the future, effort should be devoted to measurements in different seasons to further our understanding of the seasonal parameters impacting fugitive emissions of CH4 and to allow for better estimates of annual emissions and year-to-year variability.					; McLaren, Robert/F-5431-2011	Leithead, Amy/0000-0002-2860-0468; Gordon, Mark/0000-0003-4896-4661; McLaren, Robert/0000-0003-1941-5567; Darlington, Andrea/0000-0002-7469-5541; Staebler, Ralf/0000-0002-6372-0414; Li, Shao-Meng/0000-0002-7628-6581													1680-7316	1680-7324				MAY 28	2018	18	10					7361	7378		10.5194/acp-18-7361-2018	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-7361-2018													WOS:000433196500001
J	BEER, JR; LUKENS, P; OLSON, D				BEER, JR; LUKENS, P; OLSON, D			SMALL MAMMAL POPULATIONS ON THE ISLANDS OF BASSWOOD LAKE, MINNESOTA	ECOLOGY												During 1950, 1951, and 1952 5 mainland areas and 32 islands in Basswood Lake in Lake County, Minnesota were trapped for small mammals. Three spp. of hibernators, Eutamias minimus, Tamias striatus, and Zapus hudsonius, were taken on mainland. Only Z. hudsonius of this group was taken on an island. All 6 of non-hibernating spp. were found on islands. These include Microtus pennsylvanicus, Synaptomys cooperi, Clethrionamys gopperi, Peromyscus maniculatus, Blarina brevicauda and Sorex cinereus. Degree of occupancy of islands changed from 4 of 21 islands in 1950 to 21 of 24 islands in 1952. Along with this increase in proportion of islands occupied there was an increase in number of spp. found on most of islands. Water seemed to be an effective barrier to travel in summer but ice of winter becomes a highway for dispersal of non-hibernating spp. Populations of small mammals fluctuate quite widely and several populations appear to be somewhat independent of each other. Islands lag behind mainland in development of their populations.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1954	35	4					437	445		10.2307/1931033	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1931033													WOS:A1954UZ52300002

(Myxozoa: Myxosporea), infecting the Nile perch Lates niloticus (Teleostei: Centropomidae)	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS												Light microscopical description is presented for a new myxozoan species, Henneguya ghaffari, which infects the Nile perch Lates niloticus (Linnaeus, 1758) in Lake Wadi El-Raiyan in Egypt. The spore is characterized by a triangular thickening at the base of the caudal processes. The relatively long caudal processes run adherent to each other for two-thirds of their length, then bifurcate to very fine processes. Prevalence of infection was 34.6% and peaked during winter and early spring. The infection was concentrated along the intestinal tract, and in severe cases gills and gill rakers were also infected. Histology revealed that, in contrast to findings of previously published works on related species, intralamellar plasmodia did not develop inside the blood capillaries of the gills. Intestinal plasmodia were very pathogenic due to their large number and size. These plasmodia caused atrophy of the muscularis layer, and replaced and distended the submucosal and mucosal layers. The validity of some Henneguya species in Africa is discussed.																			0177-5103	1616-1580				NOV 30	1999	38	3					225	230		10.3354/dao038225	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/dao038225								10686673					WOS:000085355300009

Duplicate samples of zooplankton were obtained from three stations with different limnological characteristics. The density of zooplankton community was dominated by rotifers and small cladocerans related to the trophic status of this shallow take. The zooplankton biomass showed similar values to other eutrophic shallow lakes. The annual biomass distribution was bimodal (winter and summer peaks). The contribution of crustaceans, mainly copepods, determined the total biomass. The total zooplankton biomass was significantly correlated with chlorophyll much less thanamuch greater than in the sampling station located at the deep part of this shallow lake. There were factors and processes promoting changes in the zooplankton biomass, such as food availability, grazing ability, fish predation, eutrophication process with alternation of turbid and clear water periods, and also the addition of organisms from the Salado River during floods.

However, we must realise that resident communities may often be capable of integrating invaders, leading to patterns of coexistence. Within the past ninety years, three freshwater amphipod species have invaded Northern Ireland the North American Gammarus tigrinus and Crangonyx pseudogracilis, plus the European G. pulex. These species have come into contact with the ubiquitous native species, G. duebeni celticus. This study examined spatiotemporal patterns of stability of single and mixed species assemblages in an invaded lake. Lough Beg and its associated rivers were surveyed in summer 1994 and winter 1995, and a selection of stations re-sampled in summer one and five years later. All possible combinations of the four amphipod species were found. Although species presence/absence was stable between seasons at the scale of the whole lough, it was extremely fluid at the scale of individual sites, 82% of which changed in species composition between seasons. Overall mean amphipod abundance was similar across 5 distinguishable habitat types, but there were differences in species compositions among these habitats. In addition, although co-occurrences of Gammarus species did not differ from random, there was a strong negative association between Gammarus spp. and C. pseudogracilis. This latter pattern was at least in part generated by the better tolerance of C. pseudogracilis to lower water quality. A review of previous studies indicates that the exclusion of C. pseudogracilis by Gammarus species from high water quality areas is likely to involve biotic interaction. Thus, overall, co-existence of the four species, which is clearly dynamic and scale-dependent, appears promoted by spatial and temporal habitat heterogeneity. However, biotic interactions may also play a role in local exclusions. Since the three introduced species have not eliminated the native species, and each successive invasion has not replaced the previous invader, this study demonstrates that freshwater invaders may integrate with native communities leading to coexistence and increased species diversity.

Elevated pH Conditions Associated With Microcystis spp. Blooms Decrease Viability of the Cultured Diatom Fragilaria crotonensis and Natural Diatoms in Lake Erie	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms (CyanoHABs) commonly increase water column pH to alkaline levels >= 9.2, and to as high as 11. This elevated pH has been suggested to confer a competitive advantage to cyanobacteria such as Microcystis aeruginosa. Yet, there is limited information regarding the restrictive effects bloom-induced pH levels may impose on this cyanobacterium's competitors. Due to the pH-dependency of biosilicification processes, diatoms (which seasonally both precede and proceed Microcystis blooms in many fresh waters) may be unable to synthesize frustules at these pH levels. We assessed the effects of pH on the ecologically relevant diatom Fragilaria crotonensis in vitro, and on a Lake Erie diatom community in situ. In vitro assays revealed F. crotonensis monocultures exhibited lower growth rates and abundances when cultivated at a starting pH of 9.2 in comparison to pH 7.7. The suppressed growth trends in F. crotonensis were exacerbated when co-cultured with M. aeruginosa at pH conditions and cell densities that simulated a cyanobacteria bloom. Estimates demonstrated a significant decrease in silica (Si) deposition at alkaline pH in both in vitro F. crotonensis cultures and in situ Lake Erie diatom assemblages, after as little as 48 h of alkaline pH-exposure. These observations indicate elevated pH negatively affected growth rate and diatom silica deposition; in total providing a competitive disadvantage for diatoms. Our observations demonstrate pH likely plays a significant role in bloom succession, creating a potential to prolong summer Microcystis blooms and constrain diatom fall resurgence.

J	Smith, MKS; Rodrigues, D; Currie, B				Smith, Martin K. S.; Rodrigues, Demi; Currie, Bianca			A survey of the ichthyofauna in the Noetsie Estuary, Western Cape Province, South Africa	KOEDOE												The fish assemblage in the Noetsie Estuary, a temporarily open and closed estuary on the southern coast of South Africa, was sampled using multiple gears. A total of 12 species from 8 families were recorded. Collectively, estuarine-dependent marine species dominated seine net catches numerically and in terms of biomass for both sampling seasons. Estuarine round herring (Gilchristella aestuaria) was numerically the dominant species in late summer, while juvenile Mugilidae dominated catches in winter. Size class distributions of various fish species indicate that the estuary both serves a nursery function for important euryhaline marine species and supports estuarine resident taxa. Application of the Estuarine Fish Community Index indicates the ecological condition of the estuary to be 'good'. This study contributes to the species list for the estuary while also reporting the presence of an alien invasive freshwater species, Gambusia affinis. Recommendations include the development of a management plan and the formalisation of an estuarine management committee. Conservation implications: The Noetsie Estuary serves a nursery function for important euryhaline marine species, while supporting healthy populations of estuarine resident taxa. The presence of one alien invasive fish species is documented with potential implications for the conservation of biodiversity in the estuary.

J	Kleeberg, A; Köhler, A; Hupfer, M				Kleeberg, Andreas; Koehler, Antje; Hupfer, Michael			How effectively does a single or continuous iron supply affect the phosphorus budget of aerated lakes?	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS					12th International Association for Sediment Water Science Symposium (IASWS)	2011	Dartington, ENGLAND					Purpose In lake restoration, the redox sensitivity of iron (Fe)-phosphorus (P) compounds has been regarded as detrimental for a sustainable increase in sedimentary P retention since developing low redox potentials release Fe-bound P. Thus, Fe salts alone have rarely been used successfully to inactivate sediment P, and there are no studies on the long-term effects of in-lake Fe applications on P retention. Here, we analyzed for how long, and how efficiently, a single and continuous Fe application can affect the P budget of lakes. Materials and methods Two aerated lakes in Berlin, Germany were compared: Lake Tegel (TEG) experienced a continuous Fe supply via its tributaries, while Lake Gro-Glienicke (GGS) was treated once with Fe in the winter of 1992/1993. By controlling the operation of aerators, their effectiveness on P exchange at the sediment-water interface (non-aerated vs. aerated) was directly compared in spring and autumn between 2008 and 2010. The amount of P controllable by aeration (P (control)) was experimentally determined by non-aerated vs. aerated sediment cores (at 10 and 16 A degrees C). Core stratigraphy of Fe was observed by high-resolution mu X-ray fluorescence analysis. Results and discussion In TEG, the mobility of Fe was limited due to its sulfidic fixation, and thus Fe only accumulated slightly at the sediment surface (Fe/P ratio, similar to 3). P-control corresponded to only 4 % of the P content of the lake and 18 % of P loading. Hence, aeration only slightly influenced trophy-relevant epilimnetic P. In GGS, the single Fe application still ensures a high P binding ability of sediment since Fe relocated towards the surface (Fe/P ratio, similar to 7). P-control corresponded to 38 % of the P content of the lake and 74 % of annual P loading. Thus, the P release is not relevant for the P supply to the epilimnion since with the lake's overturn P is co-precipitated by the hypolimnetically accumulated Fe. Conclusions When external P loading is sufficiently reduced, as in GGS, amendments to Fe precipitants can increase sediment P retention in a redox-dependent manner over the long term. Thus, the redox-dependent mobility of Fe should no longer be regarded as a disadvantage of Fe-containing precipitants. To compensate for co-precipitation and complexation of Fe with sediment organic matter, a high Fe dosage (>= 200 g m(-2)) is needed.																			1439-0108	1614-7480				DEC	2012	12	10					1593	1603		10.1007/s11368-012-0590-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-012-0590-1													WOS:000311206700011

Over 50 million of the world's lakes typically freeze each winter, and the absence of winter ice cover, in lakes where ice has historically been present, can be characterized as an extreme event. We quantified the effects of extreme climate events on lake ice cover using 78-year ice records from 122 lakes to show that (1) extreme ice-free years are becoming more frequent and severe, (2) winter air temperature is a significant predictor of ice cover that was driven by large-scale climate oscillations, (3) extremes in temperature are closely related to extremes in ice cover, and (4) ice-free years are forecasted to result in significant loss of ice-cover in the future. Without drastic reductions in carbon emissions, we can expect the widespread loss of lake ice cover could have significant socioeconomic and biological implications.

Recurrent seasonal variations in abundance and composition of filamentous SOL cluster bacteria (Saprospiraceae, Bacteroidetes) in oligomesotrophic Lake Mondsee (Austria)	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The spatial and temporal variation of SOL cluster bacteria was assessed in oligomesotrophic Lake Mondsee and adjacent lakes by fluorescence in situ hybridization over two annual cycles. The filamentous SOL bacteria were present in Lake Mondsee throughout the study period, and the seasonal dynamics of the SOL community were remarkably similar with respect to both abundance and composition in the two consecutive years. Only two of the three SOL subclusters were detected in Lake Mondsee and four connected lakes. These two populations significantly differed in size distribution and demonstrated pronounced but recurrent differences in seasonality and length of period of appearance in Lake Mondsee. Extensive sampling of the lakes in September 2003 revealed low horizontal variation in the composition of the SOL community within Lake Mondsee but marked variations with depth. Between connected habitats pronounced differences in the composition and abundance of the SOL community were detected. The interaction of SOL bacteria with bacterivorous protists, mesozooplankton, and phytoplankton was investigated in order to reveal variables controlling the structure and dynamics of SOL communities. No strong indication for a bottom-up influence of phytoplankton was found, while the estimated community grazing rates of mesozooplankton on SOL bacteria indicated a top-down control of SOL abundance during mesozooplankton peaks in spring and early autumn. Furthermore, species-specific differences in grazing of mesozooplankton on SOL bacteria were observed. In general, the overall composition of SOL communities was controlled by abiotic factors (water chemistry), while their dynamics seemed to be controlled by abiotic and biotic interactions.

J	Nedoma, J; Vrba, J				Nedoma, Jiri; Vrba, Jaroslav			Specific activity of cell-surface acid phosphatase in different bacterioplankton morphotypes in an acidified mountain lake	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Activity of extracellular acid phosphatases was measured at single-cell level in bacterioplankton groups defined by their morphology and size, in acidified mountain Lake Certovo, during the 2003 season, with a method based on use of the substrate ELF97 phosphate which provides fluorescent precipitates upon hydrolysis by phosphatases. The bacterial cell-associated precipitates were quantified by image analysis. A specific, conspicuous, apparently homogeneous morphotype of curved cells of similar to 5 mu m average length, despite its low total biomass (average of 4%), contributed significantly (in average by 31%) to the total bacterioplankton phosphatase activity in Lake Certovo (ranging from 1.0 to 12.7 mu mol l(-1) h(-1), using ELF97 phosphate as a substrate). Bacterial filaments (> 10 mu m), although comprising in average 85% of bacterioplankton biomass, contributed to the total bacterioplankton activity only by 45%. Biomass-specific activity of extracellular (cell-surface) phosphatases of the main bacterioplankton morphotypes increased in the order filaments < cocci and rods < curved cells. The biomass-specific activity of bacterioplankton extracellular phosphatases (0-300 nmol mu gC(-1) h(-1)) was generally highest in the spring and decreased gradually during summer. These changes could result from seasonal changes in the phosphorus status of the lake and from subsequent regulation of enzyme expression by bacteria.

M.; Pismeniuk, Anfisa; Schwamborn, Georg; Kusch, Stephanie; Wetterich, Sebastian			Newly dated permafrost deposits and their paleoecological inventory reveal an Eemian much warmer than today in Arctic Siberia	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												In this study, we integrate geochronological, cryolithological, paleoecological, and modeling data to reconstruct the Last Interglacial (LIG) climate around the New Siberian Islands, revealing significantly warmer conditions compared to today. New luminescence dating of the lacustrine deposits mostly preserved in ice-wedge pseudomorphs of 1-3 m thickness along the Dmitry Laptev Strait indicates ages consistent with the LIG (Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e). Analysis of plant macrofossils and of pollen and faunal records (beetles and chironomids) from these deposits suggests mean temperatures of the warmest month (MTWAs) of 10.3 to 12.9 degrees C, 9.0 +/- 3.0 degrees C, 8 to 10.5 degrees C, and 9.4 to 15.3 degrees C for Bol'shoy Lyakhovsky and of 12.7 to 15.3 degrees C, 9.7 +/- 2.9 degrees C, 8 to 14 degrees C, and 12.0-13.8 degrees C for Oyogos Yar. The fossil-beetle-based mutual climate range for mean temperatures of the coldest month is -34 to -26 degrees C for Bol'shoy Lyakhovsky and -38 to -26 degrees C for Oyogos Yar. Our chironomid-based reconstructions of water table depth suggest 1.7 to 5.6 m for Bol'shoy Lyakhovsky, while previous analysis suggested 1.1 to 3.3 m for Oyogos Yar. Pollen-based reconstruction of mean annual precipitation (MAP) suggests 271 +/- 56 mm for Bol'shoy Lyakhovsky and 229 +/- 22 mm for Oyogos Yar. The first-time application of clumped isotopes to permafrost-preserved biogenic calcite of ostracods and bivalves for Oyogos Yar reconstructed near-surface water temperatures of 10.3 +/- 3.0 degrees C and bottom-water temperatures of 5.3 +/- 1.5 degrees C in thermokarst lakes during summer. In summary, the analyzed proxies suggest summers warmer than today by 5.5 to 12.8 degrees C for Bol'shoy Lyakhovsky and by 0.2 to 7.5 degrees C for Oyogos Yar and winters warmer than today by up to 7.1 and 8.4 degrees C for Bol'shoy Lyakhovsky and Oyogos Yar, respectively. Modern mean annual precipitation values are within the uncertainty range of the reconstructions. Climate model simulations for the LIG from PMIP suggest MTWAs warmer than today for Bol'shoy Lyakhovsky (4.4 +/- 1.0 degrees C compared to 2.5 degrees C) and colder than today for Oyogos Yar (4.5 +/- 1.2 degrees C compared to 7.8 degrees C), underestimating the Eemian warming reconstructed from our multiple paleoecological proxies. The LIG warming mainly affected summer conditions, whereas modern and future warming will rather impact winter conditions. As the LIG annual mean temperature is often used as an analog for the future climate in the High Arctic, the proxy-model mismatch highlights the urgent need for more systematic quantitative proxy-based temperature reconstructions in the Arctic and more sophisticated Earth system models capable of capturing Arctic paleoenvironmental conditions.

J	Rodionov, S; Assel, RA				Rodionov, S; Assel, RA			Winter severity in the Great Lakes region: a tale of two oscillations	CLIMATE RESEARCH												The effects of Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on Laurentian Great Lakes regional winter air temperature and, more generally, surface-air temperatures (SAT) over North America are examined. The relationship between ENSO and winter severity in the Great Lakes is highly nonlinear and depends on the strength of El Nino events. Significant positive correlation between the winter severity and ENSO indices noted in earlier works is limited to strong El Nino events and is associated with an expansion of positive temperature anomalies in NW North America inland toward the Great Lakes. Although both ENSO and PDO are positively correlated with the Pacific-North American (PNA) teleconnection index, a closer look at the large-scale atmospheric circulation associated with the 2 oscillations reveals a substantial difference. During warm PDO phases (not coincident with strong El Nino events), atmospheric circulation resembles the classical PNA pattern, with a strong Aleutian Low at the surface and amplified ridges and troughs in the mid-troposphere. During strong El Nino events the Aleutian Low is also stronger than normal, but shifted eastward, to the Gulf of Alaska. Over North America, an upper atmospheric ridge on the west is not accompanied with a deep trough on the east as in the classical PNA pattern. As a result, outbreaks of cold Arctic air over the eastern US are rare and winters in the Great Lakes region are abnormally mild.																			0936-577X	1616-1572				JUN 10	2003	24	1					19	31		10.3354/cr024019	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/cr024019													WOS:000186448400004

During the vegetated periods of 1998 and 2000 the abundance of larvae on P. perfoliatus and M. spicatum increased exponentially from approx. 10 ind./m(2) to a maximum of 10,000 ind./m2 or 20-165 ind./g dm. The much lower abundance in 1999 may be a result of the massive flooding of the lake in spring. Our data suggest that at least part of the Acentria population in Lake Constance may have two generations per year. Larvae use predominantly the upper shoot sections during the active feeding period and move to the lower stem sections for winter diapause. Herbivory caused substantial damage especially to the apical meristems of P. perfoliatus and M. spicatum. This study indicates that aquatic shredder-herbivores may have a stronger impact on submersed macrophytes than previously considered.

J	Bunt, CM; Jacobson, B				Bunt, Christopher M.; Jacobson, Bailey			The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a recreational rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fishery	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												There has been a recent flurry of publications describing the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on both commercial and recreational fisheries. As of yet, studies have only provided insights from researchers or industry experts detailing perceived consequences, or from survey data indicating modifications in angler activity levels and behaviours. Using real recreational fisheries data from an ongoing radio telemetry study (2018-present), we explored changes in the relative exploitation rates of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss; Walbaum 1792) in the Saugeen River, Ontario, a tributary to Lake Huron, before compared to during the pandemic. Restrictions on site access that affected the implementation of important management activities that usually support this popular fishery are also discussed. During the initial phase of complete public lock-downs imposed during spring 2020, angler exploitation rates decreased to half that reported prior to the pandemic. Fishway operations were temporarily suspended and hatchery efforts were interrupted. Once restrictions began to ease in fall 2020, there was an eight-fold increase in overall exploitation rate and a four and a half-fold increase in harvest rate compared to seasons prior to the pandemic. While the full impact of the ongoing pandemic on the Lake Huron fishery is not likely to be fully realized for several years, the potential effects on future return run sizes may need to be considered by fisheries managers monitoring trends in population escapement.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				APR	2022	105	4					499	507		10.1007/s10641-022-01250-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-022-01250-8		APR 2022						35431415					WOS:000779252100001
J	Wang, SQ; Zhang, X; Wang, C; Chen, NC				Wang, Siqi; Zhang, Xiang; Wang, Chao; Chen, Nengcheng			Multivariable integrated risk assessment for cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic lakes and its spatiotemporal characteristics	WATER RESEARCH												Climate change has catalyzed the global expansion of cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic , lakes and threatens water security. In most studies, the cyanobacterial bloom risk levels in lakes were evaluated using field-collected data from multiple indicators or spatially continuous data from one cyanobacteria-related indicator. Neverthe-less, the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes has clear spatial heterogeneity and is affected by numerous factors. Therefore, we developed a multivariable integrated risk assessment framework for cyanobacterial blooms in lakes using five spatially continuous datasets to estimate the risk level of cyanobacterial blooms at the pixel scale (250 m). The spatial and temporal variations in cyanobacterial bloom risk levels from May 1, 2002, to October 31, 2020, were investigated for three typical eutrophic lakes in China: Lakes Taihu, Chaohu, and Dia-nchi. Seasons and regions of high cyanobacterial bloom risk were identified for each lake. Environmental characteristics were discussed. A long-term investigation revealed that owing to its warm climate, the cyano-bacterial risk levels in summer and autumn were much higher than those in the other two seasons. At the synoptic scale, Lake Taihu had a lower cyanobacterial bloom risk than Lakes Chaohu and Dianchi. A further comparison found that precipitation, wind speed, and temperature were responsible for the differences in cya-nobacterial bloom risk levels among the three lakes. At the pixel scale, the risk map indicated that the cyano-bacterial bloom risk levels of Lake Taihu were unevenly distributed, and the cyanobacterial bloom risk of the lakeshore was higher than that of the other subregions. Nutrient levels played the most critical role in the regional differences in cyanobacterial bloom risk levels in a lake. While the differences of cyanobacterial bloom risk levels in three lakes were resulted by the climates. Bloom events were defined and classified as "long-term bloom" or "flash bloom" according to their duration (over or below a year). Overall, this study can assist in advanced water management with a pixel-scale evaluation of cyanobacterial bloom risk levels.					; ZHANG, Xiang/H-3158-2013; Zhang, Xiang/H-3158-2013	Chen, Nengcheng/0000-0002-3521-9972; Zhang, Xiang/0000-0002-1017-742X													0043-1354	1879-2448				JAN 1	2023	228		A						119367	10.1016/j.watres.2022.119367	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.119367		NOV 2022						36417795					WOS:000906909900002

The protection of wintering crane's habitat has attracted the wide attention of the international community. Because of the importance of the region in the protection of international biodiversity and the protection of crane habitats, it is of great reference value to study the habitat suitability changes of rare wintering cranes with spatial and temporal distribution characteristics and the distribution of habitat corridors with spatial characteristics, to improve the habitat quality of crane habitats in globally important wetlands. Based on the remote sensing image data of Chongming Dongtan and the field survey data of rare wintering cranes, this study obtained the land use change of Chongming Dongtan from 1986 to 2021 by ENVI and ArcGIS10.8 software, evaluated the habitat suitability of wintering cranes in 36 years by GIS technology, and constructed the habitat corridor of wintering cranes by using the minimum cumulative resistance model(MCR). The results showed that from 1986 to 2021, the number of four typical wintering cranes in Chongming Dongtan showed a general downward trend. In the past 36 years, the habitat suitability of wintering cranes in the internationally important wetland of Chongming Dongtan has gradually changed from a suitable area to an unsuitable area. The suitable areas are mainly distributed in the eastern and northern parts of the study area, and the unsuitable areas are mainly distributed in the western construction land area. The habitat quality of cranes is deteriorating. The overall resistance distribution of Chongming Dongtan in 2021 shows a trend of low resistance value in the east and high resistance value in the west, and the degree of obstruction is strong in the south and weak in the north. There are 208 potential habitat corridors for wintering cranes in Chongming Dongtan, with a total length of 377.12 km. Get 127 Habitat nodes. The density of habitat corridors in the eastern part of the study area is significantly higher than that in the western region, and the ecological space in the eastern region is well connected. Finally, this study proposes the identification of important habitat corridors based on gravity model and the analysis of habitat network structure based on graph theory, which provides a reference for improving the stability of habitat network by means of habitat node optimization, stepping stone increase and ecological restoration. This study is different from previous studies on large-scale ecological conditions such as cities or urban coastal zones. From the perspective of the construction of regional wetland rare species habitat network and the protection of international important wetland biodiversity with important ecological value, it is helpful to optimize the suitable habitat pattern of rare overwintering cranes and provide a method basis for the protection of rare species habitat and the construction of habitat network in regional wetlands. At the same time, Chongming Dongtan is the only internationally important wetland in Shanghai. Wintering cranes are the most important biological resources of wetlands. The study of habitat suitability changes and habitat networks can effectively promote the development of internationally important wetland cities in Shanghai.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2023	154								110692	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110692	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110692		JUL 2023											WOS:001047193200001

Together, these watersheds allow comparisons of wetland, forest, urban and agricultural land-uses. Each site was sampled nine times between September 1993 and September 1994 to establish seasonal signatures and transport processes of total mercury (Hg-T) and methylmercury (MeHg). Our results clearly show that land use and land cover strongly influence mercury transport processes. Under base-flow conditions, unfiltered MeHg yield varies by a factor of sixteen (12-195 mg km(-2) d(-1)), and increases with the fraction of wetland area in the watershed. Elevated mercury yields during high flow are particle-phase associated in agricultural sites, but filtered-phase associated in wetland sites. Methylmercury represented less than 5% of total mercury mobilized during the spring thaw across all watersheds. Autumn MeHg yield was generally 11-15% of Hg-T in wetland influenced watersheds, though a maximum of 51% was observed. In some cases, single high-flow events may dominate the annual export of mercury from a watershed. For example, one high-flow event on the agricultural Rattlesnake Creek had the largest Hg-T and MeHg yield in the study (107 and 2.32 mg km(-2) d(-1), respectively). The mass of mercury transported downstream by this single event was an order of magnitude larger than the eight other (non-event) sampling dates combined. These results underscore the importance of watershed characteristics and seasonal events on the fate of mercury in fresh water rivers.

J	Hopkinson, C; Young, GJ				Hopkinson, C; Young, GJ			The effect of glacier wastage on the flow of the Bow River at Banff, Alberta, 1951-1993	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												A surface area/volume relationship was used to estimate total glacier volumes for the highly glacierized Hector Lake Basin (281 km(2)) in the Canadian Rockies in the years 1951 and 1993. The change in volume was calculated and this value then extrapolated up to the Bow Basin at Banff (2230 km(2)) based on relative proportions of glacier cover. The mean net glacier volume loss estimate of 934 x 10(6) m(3) was divided into annual proportions of glacier wastage and storage using a local mass balance record collected at Peyto Glacier in the Mistaya Valley, contiguous to the Bow Basin. Unfortunately, the record began in 1966 and a hind-cast to 1952 (hydrological year) was necessary. Banff maximum summer temperature and Lake Louise snow course data were used as surrogates for summer and winter glacier mass balance, respectively. Monthly wastage proportions were estimated for 1967-1974 by using modelled values of glacial melt as a template. Glacier wastage inputs to and storage held back from the Bow River hydrograph at Banff were compared with known basin yields to assess the hydrological effects of glacier volume change. For 1952-1993, the average annual wastage/basin yield ratio was found to be around 1.8%. For the extremely low flow year of 1970 this ratio increased to 13%. The proportion of flow derived from glacier wastage in August of this year was estimated to be around 56%. Although the results tend to confirm the regulatory effect of glaciers on stream flow, it was found that in some years of low flow this situation has been aggravated by water being held in glacial storage.

Here we present a novel approach to quantify the relative importance of regulating factors in natural systems over various time scales: we calculated daily effect sizes of major factors affecting phytoplankton growth during the spring bloom period during almost three decades of lake oligotrophication using numerical experiments with a data based simulation model. We show that with oligotrophication the regulation of spring phytoplankton shifts from primarily topdown to bottomup, and that the changes in regulation are non-linearly related to the nutrient (phosphorus) concentrations. Our findings indicate that long-term changes in topdown regulation cannot be understood without considering multiple herbivore taxa, here, microzooplankton (ciliates) and mesozooplankton (daphnids). We further demonstrate that bottomup and topdown regulation are not independent from each other and that their interaction is time-scale dependent.

J	Hu, YM; Zhang, YH; Peng, ZL; Hu, WP				Hu, Yuemin; Zhang, Yihui; Peng, Zhaoliang; Hu, Weiping			Hydrodynamic effects on the ability of bottom traps to capture nutrient-rich sediments in shallow eutrophic lakes	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Hydrodynamics are the key factor influencing sediment resuspension, transport and nutrient release in large shallow lakes. However, the hydrodynamic responses of bottom traps during pollutant capture remain unclear. In this study, a large eutrophic shallow lake was selected to carry out a field test of deep traps at the lake bottom. Based on observations of the lake current around the trap, the sedimentation rate of the particles in the trap and the nutrient content of the captured sediments, combined with the numerical simulation of the waves outside the trap, the effects of lake currents and waves on the sediment deposition in the traps were studied, and the response of the nutrient content of the sediments captured in the deep traps to the changes in lake currents and waves was analyzed. The results showed that the strong hydrodynamic force significantly promoted sediment deposition in the trap and enhanced the ability of the trap to capture sediments with high nutrient contents. The influences of waves and lake currents on the bottom trap capture of polluted sediments varied among different periods. Waves played the leading role in winter and spring, accelerating sediment capture in the bottom traps near the southern shore of eastern Lake Chaohu during this period. In summer, the lake current was the main dynamic factor contributing to the rapid deposition of particulate matter and the capture of sediments with high nutrient contents in the bottom traps of western Lake Chaohu. The multiple stepwise linear regression model based on lake current and wave data explained 37.6 % of the sediment deposition in the trap, and the model built for a single bottom trap explained more than 80 % of the deposition. After correcting the sediment deposition thickness in the trap by considering the water content of the sediment, the quantitative relation yield better inversion results for the sediment deposition process, and different thicknesses in the bottom trap were linked to different sediment deposition periods. According to the hydrodynamic strength in 2020, the thickness of the highly contaminated sediments captured by traps CC1-CC5 was calculated to be 1.09-1.93 m, and the corresponding TN and TP were 26.66-68.53 kg and 6.84-19.89 kg, respectively. This study provides a scientific analysis and guidance for the evaluation of endogenous nutrients captured by lake bottom trap methods.					hu, weiping/LIH-2020-2024														0022-1694	1879-2707				MAR	2023	618								129245	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129245	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129245		FEB 2023											WOS:000946502800001

In specialized test settings, researchers have developed methods to alter window designs to mitigate collisions. However, few published studies provide pretest and posttest evaluations of mitigation treatment areas and untreated control areas on existing buildings. We initially monitored bird-window collisions at a single building on the University of Utah campus in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA, during winter 1 (November 9, 2017 January 2, 2018). We found 15 bird-window collisions, most under a portion of the building with a mirrored facade. To test a mitigation treatment, we installed Feather Friendly (R) bird deterrent film on part of the mirrored facade after winter 1. The unmitigated areas of the same building served as a control area. We continued monitoring during the following winter 2 (November 15, 2018-January 12, 2019). The treated area collisions declined from seven before mitigation to two after mitigation, a 71% reduction. The control area had eight collisions at both times. Results of a generalized estimating equation yielded a significant area by season interaction effect (p = 0.03) and fewer collisions in the mitigated area than the control area at winter 2 (p = 0.03), supporting efficacy of the mitigation. In winter 2 we also expanded monitoring to eight total buildings to evaluate the risks of mirrored windows and proximity to fruiting pear trees (Prunus calleryana) and the benefits of bird-friendly glass. Bird-friendly glass, found on two buildings, included windows with permanent flitted dots or embedded ultraviolet patterns. We counted 22 collisions across the eight buildings. Mirrored windows and proximity to fruiting pear trees related to higher odds of bird-window collisions, based on separate generalized estimating equations. The best fit model included mirrored windows and pear trees. The two buildings with bird-friendly glass had only one collision, suggesting that these designs deter collisions, although the difference was not statistically significant. To publicize the study and to receive reports of additional bird collisions or fatalities on campus, we created a citizen science project on iNaturalist and engaged in additional outreach efforts that yielded 22 ad hoc reports. Many previous studies have documented Cedar Waxwing (Bombycilla cedrorum) collisions, but at relatively low numbers. Cedar Waxwings accounted for 31 of 34 identifiable collisions from the monitoring study and 4 of 21 identifiable collisions or fatalities from ad hoc reports.																			2167-8359					SEP 2	2019	7								e7620	10.7717/peerj.7620	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.7620								31534854					WOS:000483310100010

It is the second-largest freshwater lake in China and plays an important role in regulating the amount of water in the Yangtze River, China's longest river. The annual water level of the lake changes by as much as 15 m, rising in summer and falling in winter. Asian schistosomiasis has been endemic in the Dongting Lake region for centuries and it has had a devastating effect on the public health of the local people. After a difficult struggle for more than four decades, a concerted programme, supported by the World Bank Loan and instigated in 1992, has resulted in remarkable progress in the control of the disease in many endemic areas of the region. However, the great challenge remains to consolidate and maintain the achievements made to date. The Schistosoma japonicum intermediate host (Oncomelania hupensis hupensis) snail habitats are huge, estimated at 1768 km(2) in 1996; these are increasing at a rate of 34.7 km(2) annually due to high silt deposition from the Yangtze River itself and from the connecting rivers in Hunan province, and construction of embankments in the Dongting Lake region. It is anticipated that the construction of the Three Gorges Super Dam, the largest engineering project ever undertaken, will substantially extend the range of the snail habitats and increase the number of new schistosomiasis cases. In many areas, human re-infections with S. japonicum after drug (praziquantel) treatment remain unacceptably high (up to 20% of those treated are re-infected annually) due to occupational (mainly fishing) water contact. This paper reviews the history and the current status of schistosomiasis control in the lake region, it explores the epidemiological factors which influence the prevalence of the infection and the disease it causes, and it provides insight into future approaches to control which might finally eradicate the infection.

From the zoogeographic point of view, Carpathian endemites and Central European species prevail. Forty percent of species are sensitive to acidification. The former has a smaller catchment and total area, and is relatively shallow, without inlet. It is strongly affected by acidification.

The empirical regression equation was: F2 = 420.7 +/- 187.8 + 0.896 +/- 0.26 F4. F2 showed the highest peak in March, due to spring blooms of phytoplankton. The part shared by the Fe/Mn oxides fraction (F3) in building up PZn was monitored through their positive correlation. F4 was the second smallest after F1. The diminishing of the inert fraction (F5) in some months supported the increase in the other mobile, hence dangerous, fractions.																			0144-7815		978-1-901502-97-8				2005	293						264	272																WOS:000248925400035

The northern-most Italian population of Cistus albidus provides an outstanding case for study, as it grows at the extreme northern edge of its range and because phenological data have been available since the early XIX century. In the period 2012-2017, we analysed the population demography and spatial structure, growth and flowering phenology, and genetic variability to understand the history, current state and possible evolution of this population. Lastly, the population data were tested for association with environmental factors. The population studied consists of plants on average 10 years old, showing the highest growth rates in spring and autumn. Anthesis starts in April and ends in early June and is significantly dependent on temperature. High levels of genetic variability are present (average He = 0.471), with heterozygote excess detected at four loci out of five. Bayesian analysis does not support any genetic structuring of the population. The aggregated pattern in the distribution of individuals and their phenological traits, together with the absence of genetic structuring, seem to suggest that this extreme geographical population is not currently endangered.

Utilizing the OPtical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM) for soil moisture estimation, we have proposed an improved version of OPTRAM aimed to identify wetlands and irrigation water ponds in irrigation district using Sentinel-2 data through Google Earth Engine platform. Different criteria were used for the identification of wetland and irrigation water pond, given the greater diversity associated with wetlands. Parameters for the wet edge determined from OPTRAM were used to identify wetlands, while an additional threshold was added to the model and calibrated in accordance with the irrigated area to identify irrigation water ponds. The improved OPTRAM was applied in Hetao Irrigation District (HID) of Northwest China from 2016 to 2023, where autumn irrigation applied in late autumn after crop harvesting was considered. The identified distributions of wetland and autumn irrigation were validated with observations from field survey and statistical data, and were also compared with other remote sensing products. Results show that the proposed model is effective in identifying both wetlands and irrigation ponds. Considering the wetlands, the distances from identified boundaries to the actual boundaries obtained from field surveys were calculated, revealing the mean absolute error of 6.99 m, alongside a validation accuracy ratio of 0.94 for points located within wetlands. For autumn irrigation extent, the overall accuracy is 0.90 based on the observations from field survey, with mean absolute relative errors for irrigated areas across four sub-irrigation districts recorded as 20.55%, 8.10%, 12.83%, and 11.38%, respectively, when compared with statistical data. The majority of wetlands within HID are small in size and scattered, with different trends observed in the wetland areas of sub-irrigation districts and Wuliangsuhai Lake. Autumn irrigated croplands are mainly concentrated in Jiefangzha sub-irrigation district while being scattered across other sub-irrigation districts, depicting an overall decreasing trend in the autumn irrigated area. In summary, the proposed model performed well in identifying both wetlands and irrigation ponds, and can offer valuable support for the conservation of wetland ecosystem and irrigation management.					liu, yuxuan/IZQ-5111-2023; Shang, Songhao/B-1400-2009														1548-1603	1943-7226				DEC 31	2024	61	1							2422930	10.1080/15481603.2024.2422930	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2024.2422930													WOS:001349229200001

Effect of macrophyte community composition and nutrient enrichment on plant biomass and algal blooms	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												Submerged freshwater macrophytes decline with increasing eutrophication. This has consequences for ecosystem processes in shallow lakes and ponds as macrophytes can reduce algal blooms under eutrophic conditions. We hypothesize that the productivity of submerged vegetation, biomass change under eutrophication and the suppression of algal blooms may be affected by macrophyte community composition. To test our hypothesis, we established three macrophyte community types in 36 fishless experimental ponds: one dominated by the oligotrophic species Chara globularis, one dominated by the eutrophic species Potamogeton pectinatus and a diverse vegetation which became co-dominated by Elodea nuttallii and C. globularis, and we fertilized half of the ponds. The macrophyte communities produced different amounts of biomass and they responded differently to fertilization. The community dominated by Potamogeton produced the lowest overall biomass, but was not affected by nutrient addition. The communities dominated by Chara and co-dominated by Elodea and Chara produced more than four-fold the amount of biomass produced in Potamogeton communities under oligotrophic conditions, but were strongly negatively affected by nutrient addition. Phytoplankton abundance did not differ significantly among the plant community types, but showed large variation within community types. There was a significant negative relationship between spring macrophyte biomass and the probability of summer algal blooms. The occurrence of algal blooms coincided with low daphnid densities and high pH (> 10). We conclude that the macrophyte community composition, characterized by the dominant species, strongly affected the amount of biomass production as well as the short-term response of the vegetation to nutrient enrichment. Macrophyte community composition had no direct effect on algal blooms, but can affect the occurrence of algal blooms indirectly as these occurred only in ponds with low (<100 g/m(2) DW) spring macrophyte biomass.					van Donk, Ellen/B-7272-2008; Declerck, Steven/E-4338-2010; Bakker, Elisabeth/B-7185-2008; Hidding, Bert/C-3622-2008; Nolet, Bart/C-1416-2008	van Donk, Ellen/0000-0003-3279-4936; Declerck, Steven/0000-0001-6179-667X; Bakker, Elisabeth/0000-0002-5900-9136; Nolet, Bart/0000-0002-7437-4879													1439-1791	1618-0089					2010	11	5					432	439		10.1016/j.baae.2010.06.005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2010.06.005													WOS:000282198200007

Winter conditions are not known. Chub population is dense and between 0.5-1.0% are deformed. Information on chub from other lakes indicates that this percentage is high. The cause of the deformity is unknown. Spawning occurs throughout July into Aug. over vegetation to which eggs adhere. Eggs hatch in 6-15 days. Young feed exclusively on invertebrates. Older fish are omnivorous, but rarely piscivorous. In Enos Lake, through the week of investigations, adults fed exclusively on Chara sp. Sexual maturity is uncommon in age group IV, common in V, and complete in VI. Maximum longevity is 9-10 years. Young chub are territorial; older chub, partially so. Richardsonius balteatus hydrophlox is an important associate. Salmo clarki lewisi is a predatory fish, but these as well as other predators are not abundant. Age analysis of chub collections failed to show any difference between survival rates of normal and deformed chub.

Peri-urban development, currently one of the most pervasive processes of land use change in Europe, exposes ponds to both urban and agricultural contaminants, causing a potential combination of adverse effects. This study, focused on 12 ponds located in a peri-urban area, has two main objectives: (1) to link the physico-chemical characteristics of the waters and the nature of their contaminants, either organic or mineral, with the human activities around ponds, and (2) to estimate the environmental risk caused by these contaminants. The ponds were sampled during two consecutive years in both spring and in autumn. Although the ponds were distributed over a limited geographical area, their contamination profiles were different and more correlated with the agricultural than the urban land use. In terms of aptitude for biology, half of the ponds were classified in degraded states due to their physico-chemical parameters, but without correlation with the endocrine disrupting activities and the levels of organic pollutants as indicators. The main quantified organic pollutants, however, were pesticides with sufficiently high levels in certain cases to induce an environmental risk exceeding the classical thresholds of risk quotient.

It is therefore crucial to obtain information on their presence, abundance, and distribution. The bloody-red shrimp Hemimysis anomala, which originated from the Ponto-Caspian area, has recently settled in Western European lakes, including Lake Geneva. Although divers have frequently reported the presence and development of this small crustacean over the last decade, no monitoring has yet been proposed. During a period of 2.5 yr, we tested and optimized an environmental deoxyribonucleic acid approach by comparing two polymerase chain reaction techniques, quantitative and digital droplet polymerase chain reaction, to assess the presence, abundance, and dynamics of the animal as well as that of a potential predator, the perch (Perca fluviatilis). We show and discuss the efficiency of the methods and reveal for the first time the seasonal dynamics of Hemimysis anomala at a selected site in Lake Geneva. We highlight, in agreement with diving observations, that the animal's abundance is high in winter and declines rapidly in early spring, concomitantly with temperature increase and perch presence.

Exceptional lipid storage mode of the copepod Boeckella poopoensis in a pampean salt lake, Argentina	AQUATIC BIOLOGY												The lipid biochemistry of zooplankton was investigated in Lake Chasico, a pampean salt lake in Argentina. The lipid biomass of the zooplankton community was dominated by the calanoid copepod Boeckella poopoensis. The major storage lipids during winter were wax esters and triacylglycerols, which reached up to 59 and 37% of the total lipids, respectively. A striking feature of the zooplankton fatty acid composition was the extraordinarily high level of 18: 4(n-3) and 20: 4(n-3) fatty acids, the highest ever reported for the latter in zooplankton. During winter, 20: 4(n-3) accounted on average for 20% of the total fatty acids in the wax ester fraction and 7% in the triacylglycerols. The close relationship (r = 0.83, p < 0.001) between the 2 fatty acids implies the biosynthesis of 20: 4(n-3) in B. poopoensis by chain elongation of 18: 4(n-3), a dietary precursor and flagellate marker. The accumulation of 20: 4(n-3) may be also partially related to B. poopoensis grazing on heterotrophic protozoa or non-flagellated chlorophytes, although this fatty acid was almost absent in the seston fraction. In summer, wax esters were slightly lower (45%), compensated by higher phospholipid levels. The 16: 0 fatty alcohol moiety was predominant in the wax esters of all samples, corroborating the opportunistic feeding behavior of B. poopoensis. The high amounts of wax esters in zooplankton are typical of marine species, suggesting that the wax ester biosynthesis of B. poopoensis and the extraordinary fatty acid composition are adaptations to the unstable environmental conditions of salt lakes.

J	Pöysä, H				Poysa, Hannu			Local variation in the timing and advancement of lake ice breakup and impacts on settling dynamics in a migratory waterbird	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Timing of ice-out is important to fundamental hydrological and ecological processes in freshwater ecosystems at high northern latitudes. While earlier ice-out in lakes during the last century is a well-documented phenomenon across the Northern Hemisphere, local variation in the rate of advancement of ice-out has received little attention. Here, records of ice-out date in 1991-2020 from 37 small lakes in a boreal catchment area in southeastern Finland were used to study variation in the timing of ice-out and its advancement. In addition, data of settling phenology of migratory common goldeneyes (Bucephala clangula) at the study lakes were used to examine how betweenyear and within-season variation in the timing of ice-out affects lake settlement of the species. Overall, ice-out date (IOD, the timing of ice break-up in the spring) advanced 9.8 days during the 30-year study period, April temperature being more important than winter temperature (severity) in determining the IOD. Rate of the advancement of IOD in individual lakes varied from 1.5 to 16.1 days, having advanced more in relatively larger lakes. Lakes at higher elevations had later mean IOD than lakes at lower elevations. Within-season differences among the lakes in IOD increased from 1991 to 2020, this variation being mainly driven by temperature during the ice melting period. Lakes with late mean IOD were settled later in a season by breeding common goldeneyes than lakes with early IOD. The faster the ice melting progressed within a season, the faster common goldeneyes settled the breeding lakes. The results demonstrate how global warming differently affects IOD in boreal lakes even within the same catchment area. More research in the landscape context is needed to enhance our understanding of changes in IOD in boreal lakes and how differently advancing IOD affects local dynamics of species dependent on open water.

J	Ishii, H; Toyota, T				Ishii, Haruki; Toyota, Takenobu			Temporal evolution of the structural properties of seasonal sea ice during the early melt season	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												During the early melt season, when sea-ice extent begins to retreat due to increasing heat absorption from the atmosphere and ocean, the sea ice becomes porous and weakens. This induces the break-up of ice floes and accelerates the melting process substantially. Determining how sea-ice structure evolves during this season is important for understanding the melting process on a global scale. We investigated this issue using field observations, laboratory experiments and numerical modeling, focusing on the effect of the C-shaped temperature profile on the internal structure of sea ice. Field observations were conducted to examine this effect on similar to 0.3 m thick ice on Lake Saroma, located at the coast of Hokkaido, Japan. To test the generalization from these observational case studies, laboratory experiments were conducted using a tank with 0.12 m thick ice. Additionally, evolution of ice structure from winter to early spring was numerically analyzed using meteorological data. From these studies, we find that the heat convergence, caused by the C-shape temperature profile, is essential to the internal melting particularly in the upper layer. This increases the porosity of the sea ice, leading to a rapid decrease in its flexural strength during the season.

J	Girjatowicz, JP				Girjatowicz, JP			The influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation on ice conditions in coastal lakes of the Southern Baltic Sea	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												This paper focuses on relationships between the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAO) and the ice conditions in coastal lakes (Jamno, Bukowo, Gardno and Lebsko) of the southern Baltic Sea. The data on ice conditions included : date of first ice appearance (F), date of last ice disappearance (D), number of days with ice (N), length of the ice season (in days; S) and maximum ice thickness (H) during the given winter. The period examined covers the winters from 1960/61 to 1999/2000. The monthly values of the NAO index for the same period were applied in accordance with Jones et al. (1997). Correlation and regression analysis methods were applied to determine and study the relationships between NAO (independent variable) and the parameters of ice conditions (dependent variables). The strongest relationships, with a linear correlation coefficient exceeding - 0.80, were obtained for the date of the last ice disappearance (D) in Lebsko Lake (- 0.853) and Gardno Lake (- 0.828) for the January-March period. In contrast, the relationships between the NAO index and the date of first ice appearance (F) are much weaker. They are statistically significant only in November and early winter (Nov.-Dec., Nov.-Jan.). The correlation coefficients in the coastal lakes of the Southern Baltic Sea coasts generally increase eastwards, a phenomenon related to the severity of winters and to the increasing continuity of ice phenomena during a given winter in this direction.																			0003-4088	2100-000X					2003	39	1					71	80		10.1051/limn/2003007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2003007													WOS:000181866200007

This bears hydromorphological pressures which are important factors causing lowered ecological status. Water level fluctuation triggers erosion on the shoreline and, depending on fluctuation range, also affects species composition or disappearance of sensitive aquatic macrophytes. We developed a water level-drawdown index (WIc) for Nordic lakes using macrophyte data from 73 lakes with varying water level fluctuation in Finland, Norway and Sweden. The index is based on the ratio between sensitive and tolerant macrophyte species. The sensitive and tolerant species are identified based on a percentile approach, analysing the presence or absence of species along the winter drawdown range. The index correlates well with winter drawdown in Finnish and Norwegian lakes with strongest correlations with winter drawdown in storage lakes (lakes regulated for hydroelectric power and with a considerable winter drawdown). The WIc-index is applicable in low alkalinity, oligotrophic and ice-covered lakes, and is suggested to be a useful tool to identify and designate heavily modified water bodies in Nordic lakes according to the European Water Framework Directive.

Polymorphism was screened at six microsatellite loci and mtDNA for a total of 247 and 94 ciscoes, respectively. Microsatellite data showed a weak differentiation between spring-spawning Coregonus fontanae and sympatric C. albula in Lake Stechlin (F-ST = 0-0(.)008), whereas a significant differentiation was observed between spring-spawning Coregonus lucinensis and sympatric C. albula in Lake Breiter Luzin (F-ST = 0(.)013-0(.)039). A more pronounced genetic difference was observed between both spring-spawning species (F-ST = 0(.)05-0(.)128). Shared mtDNA haplotypes among sympatric species within both Lake Stechlin and Lake Breiter Luzin were observed, whereas no haplotype was shared between C. fontanae and C. lucinensis. These results suggest an independent origin for spring-spawning ciscoes in each lake. Evidence is also provided for mtDNA introgression of Coregonus sardinella into C. lucinensis and C. albula in Lake Breiter Luzin. Postglacially, this species or at least a population which showed mtDNA introgression has colonized the Baltic Sea basin up to the glacial margin that was located between Lakes Stechlin and Breiter Luzin.

Two of the most important areas where redheads traditionally concentrate in winter are the Laguna Madre and nearby bays in southern Texas and the Chandeleur Sound in southeastern Louisiana. Redheads experience saline-to-hypersaline (>35 ppt) conditions in southern Texas, where they have ready access to numerous coastal ponds for drinking water. Redheads in the Chandeleur Sound experience reduced salinity (<30 ppt), and they seldom use supplemental fresh water. We weighed and analyzed supraorbital salt glands from redheads wintering in Texas and Louisiana. Mean mass of salt glands was lowest in November and became stabilized in size by January. Mean mass of salt glands in Texas did not differ between the two winters. The mass of salt glands of redheads from Texas (winters combined) was intermediate to, and significantly different from, the mean masses of salt glands of redheads from two different winters in Louisiana. Females exhibited smaller salt glands than did males in both Texas and Louisiana, suggesting that they were under less osmotic loading than males. Young birds during the second winter in Louisiana exhibited the heaviest salt glands, and therefore the most osmotic loading, of all birds in both states. Water balance concerns and osmoregulatory costs should be integrated more fully into future foraging and energetics studies of water birds in marine, coastal, and estuarine systems.																			1217-8837						2008	54			1			251	264																WOS:000266462100023
J	Bano, N; Moran, MA; Hodson, RE				Bano, N; Moran, MA; Hodson, RE			Photochemical formation of labile organic matter from two components of dissolved organic carbon in a freshwater wetland	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												We studied the photoproduction of biologically labile compounds from 2 chemically defined fractions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and whole (unfractionated) DOM from an acidic freshwater wetland (Okefenokee Swamp, Georgia, USA). Water samples were collected in summer (July 1995) and winter (February 1996), and for the winter sample, DOM was separated into humic substances and 'non-humic' compounds by fractionation on an XAD-8 resin. Following exposure in quartz flasks to either natural or simulated sunlight, bacteria were found to utilize as much as 300% more organic matter in irradiated whole DOM and chemical fractions compared to non-irradiated counterparts. Previous studies have shown that humic substances, which have strong absorption in the UV region of sunlight, are important sources of biologically labile photoproducts. We now demonstrate that compounds outside this operational definition are also sources for labile photoproducts, and that production rates on an absorbance-normalized basis can be equivalent for the humic and non-humic components of DOM. Humic substances were nonetheless calculated to be the primary source of bio logically labile photoproducts in these samples, based on the fact that they absorbed most (> 85 %) of the sunlight. Exposure of DOM fractions to sunlight for the equivalent of 7 h of noontime sun (at 34 degrees N latitude) resulted in the bacterial utilization lover a subsequent 4 d period) of up to 6% of the humic substances pool (compared to 1.5 % for non-irradiated controls), and 11 % of the non-humic compounds (compared to 3% for non-irradiated controls).

"Can you take me higher?": Normative thresholds for air quality in the Salt Leke City Metropolitan area	JOURNAL OF LEISURE RESEARCH												Urban-proximate protected areas provide metropolitan residents with a variety of benefits. We explored the pursuit of clean air by winter outdoor recreationists who live in the Salt Lake City metropolitan area of northern Utah, a region that experiences seasonal air pollution events. To better understand how air quality in the Salt Lake Valley affects winter outdoor recreation in the nearby Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest (UWCNF), we employed qualitative interviews (n = 14) and a norms-based thresholds questionnaire (n = 380). Results suggest that degraded metropolitan air quality serves as an impetus for winter outdoor recreation in the UWCNF and, at the same time, disproportionately displaces certain recreationists from outdoor pursuits. Participants' normative transit behaviors are discussed, as are the effects of existing air quality conditions on self-reports. These results help illustrate air quality is a viable indicator of overall outdoor recreation quality in the UWCNF and likely in other urban-proximate protected areas.

Mid-Holocene reinforcement of North Atlantic atmospheric circulationvariability from a western Baltic lake sediment record	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Knowledge about the timing, amplitude and spatial gradients of Holocene environmental variability in the circum-Baltic region is key to understanding its responses to ongoing climate change. Based on a multi-dating and proxy approach, we reconstruct changes in productivity using total organic carbon (TOC) contents in sediments of Lake Kalksjon (KKJ) from west-central Sweden spanning the last 9612 (+255/-114) years. An exception is the period from 1878 CE until today, in which sedimentation was dominated by anthropogenic lake level lowering and land use. In-lake productivity was higher during periods of warmer winters with shortened ice cover and prolonged growing seasons. A multi-millennial increase in productivity throughout the last & SIM; 9600 years is associated with progressively warmer winters in northwestern Europe, likely triggered by the coinciding increase in Northern Hemisphere winter insolation. Decadal to centennial periods of higher productivity in KKJ tend to correspond to warmer winters during a more positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) polarity, as reconstructed for the last 8000 years. In consequence, we assume our decadal to centennial productivity record from KKJ sediments for the complete & SIM; 9600 years to provide a qualitative record of NAO polarity. A shift towards higher productivity variability at & SIM; 5450 cal a BP is hypothesized to reflect a reinforcement of NAO-like atmospheric circulation variability, possibly driven by more vigorous changes in North Atlantic deep-water formation.

An assessment of the mean annual precipitation needed to sustain Lake Sambhar in Rajasthan, India, during mid-Holocene time	HOLOCENE												An application of a simple hydrological model to likely climatic conditions of Lake Sambhar provides tighter bounds on the range of increased precipitation seen during the early- to mid-Holocene than those inferred from paleoclimatic proxies. To examine past lake levels, we developed a simple lake model, based on hydrological principles of a watershed balance between precipitation, evaporation, and runoff from the watershed to calculate daily depth and volume. Calculations reveal that early- to mid-Holocene rainfall was most likely in a range of 40-65% greater than present levels, resulting in lake depths of similar to 6-8m. This estimate incorporates all major sources of uncertainty into the lake model, but it is likely that the value of mid-Holocene precipitation lies in the lower part of the 40-65% range. Additionally, a 40-65% greater precipitation could have led to greater interannual variability in lake levels, which may account for the lack of clear shorelines. We find, however, that it is unlikely that Lake Sambhar filled to its maximum depth of 21m above the present-day lakebed during this period due both to the much greater precipitation than today required to maintain a lake of such depth (greater than double present-day precipitation) and to the lack of current evidence (no shorelines and little vegetation). We also find that differences between mid-Holocene and present-day winter insolation alone have virtually no effect on average annual lake depths.

J	Conradie, KR; Barnard, S				Conradie, Karin R.; Barnard, Sandra			The dynamics of toxic Microcystis strains and microcystin production in two hypertrofic South African reservoirs	HARMFUL ALGAE												The South African impoundments of Hartbeespoort and Roodeplaat experience excessive blooms of Microcystis species each year. Microcystins, produced primarily by strains of cyanobacteria belonging to the genera Microcystis, Anabaena and Planktothrix, are harmful cyanobacterial hepatotoxins. These bloom-forming cyanobacteria form toxic and non-toxic strains that co-occur and are visually indistinguishable, but can be identified and quantified molecularly. We described the relationships between microcystin production and the genotypic composition of the Microcystis community involved together with environmental conditions in both the Roodeplaat and Hartbeespoort reservoirs using quantitative real time PCR. DNA copy number of the Microcystis-specific 16S rRNA and toxin biosynthesis genes, mcyE and mcyB, were measured. Planktothrix spp. occurred in both reservoirs during autumn, but no toxin-producing species was present as measured with mcyE specific primers, whereas both toxic and non-toxic strains of Microcystis were recorded in both reservoirs, with Microcystis spp. dominating in the summer months. Water-surface temperature correlated strongly with microcystin concentration, mcyE and mcyB copy number. Microcystin production was associated by temperatures higher than 23 degrees C. This suggests that should current environmental trends persist with surface water temperatures continuing to rise and more and more nutrients continued to be loaded into fresh water systems toxic Microcystis may outgrow non-toxic Microcystis and synthesise even more microcystins.

In this study, we detected the dynamics of water quality and its driven mechanisms in the Yangtze River Delta plain, one of the most developed areas in China. The results showed that the spatial agglomerations of dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), and total phosphorus (TP) presented seasonal differences, which exhibited a trend of shifting from west to east and then to west from spring to winter. Further, the relative contribution rates of the river network characteristics affecting water quality were quantified on the basis of backpropagation artificial neural networks. We found that the average contribution rates of river structure (more than 60%) were higher than that of river connectivity, and the dominant factors influencing water quality were water surface ratio (W-P) and multifractal indices (Delta a, Delta f). Specifically, the average relative contribution rates of W-P, Delta a and Delta f were 18.72%, 15.03%, and 14.52% during the flood season, respectively, and 15.83%, 16.58%, and 14.54% during the non-flood season. The functional connectivity influenced by obstruction of sluices also influences water quality, which accounting for 11.15% and 12.85% in the flood and non-flood seasons, respectively.

The distribution of Stenodus in Great Slave Lake, and in northern North America is outlined. Rate of growth, detd. from scales of 298 fish, was rapid, even in this highly oligotrophic lake. Inconnu spawn mainly in the rivers which enter Great Slave Lake from the Mackenzie Lowlands. The upstream run occupies most of the summer but with a major movement in late Aug. The post-spawning, downstream run takes place in late Sept. or early Oct., when many are taken for winter dog feed. The food of young inconnu in the spawning streams was found to be mainly invertebrates, whereas in Great Slave Lake, the species is almost entirely piscivorous. A list of parasites is given, among which Triaenophorus crassus is considered of major importance.

These two diving ducks fed mainly on mussels Musculista senhousia, but used food resources differently. Common pochards foraged larger mussels that were depleted earlier than the smaller ones eaten by tufted ducks. After the mussel biomass decreased in late winter, tufted ducks shifted their diet to clams Ruditapes philippinarum and Crustacea, while common pochards shifted only to the clam. Thus, depletion of mussel biomass in the lagoon affected common pochards earlier and stronger than tufted ducks. We suggest that different use of food resources of each species influenced their wintering patterns. Tufted ducks used the wintering area for a long period, while common pochards moved to the other area when animal foods became less abundant. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Karvonen, A; Cheng, GH; Valtonen, ET				Karvonen, A; Cheng, GH; Valtonen, ET			Within-lake dynamics in the similarity of parasite assemblages of perch (Perca fluviatilis)	PARASITOLOGY												Although parasite communities have been studied extensively in recent years, spatial and temporal variation in factors affecting the communities has received less attention. This paper examined the similarity of parasite assemblages of perch (Perca fluviatilis) in 18 locations within a single lake in relation to geographical distance and temporal dynamics in the host and parasite populations. We expected that in the present study-scale where distinct but potentially interacting host subpopulations could occur, similarity of the assemblages could be affected by seasonal dynamics in host movements particularly during the spawning period. Parasite species showed differences in infection levels between the sampling locations and similarity of the assemblages of autogenic parasite species in winter, measured inversely as difference in parasite numbers, was negatively affected by geographical distance between the locations. However, no such relationship was observed in the allogenic species Ichthyocotylurus variegata. Furthermore, no relationship was found either in autogenic parasites when the locations were re-sampled in summer, after the spawning period of perch. We concluded that the effect of geographical distance on the similarity of parasite assemblages is a dynamic process, which is affected by seasonal dynamics in host and parasite populations.

Due to this fact, tyre models for snow and ice are always under investigation at the Vehicle Dynamics team of the Ford Motor Company. This could help to test the ESC in simulation more independent from the winter season. To achieve this goal, different tyres were measured with a tyre test trailer on a frozen lake in Sweden. From these measurements, Pacejka coefficients for the tyres were identified. Then, full vehicle measurements were done at the same location to validate the identified parameters and to review the quality of the tyre model in full vehicle simulations.																					978-1-84469-032-9				2015							324	329																WOS:000375226400039
J	TITUS, JE; HOOVER, DT				TITUS, JE; HOOVER, DT			REPRODUCTION IN 2 SUBMERSED MACROPHYTES DECLINES PROGRESSIVELY AT LOW PH	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Greenhouse experiments tested the effect of pH 5 v pH 7.5 on reproductive success for the freshwater macrophytes Najas flexilis, an annual, and Vallisneria americana, which perennates as a tuber. 2. Seed production by the small Najas plants grown at pH 5 averaged 0.25 seeds/plant, in contrast to 95.5 seeds/plant at pH 7.5. At low pH, Vallisneria grown from seeds produced no flowers and too few tubers to replace themselves, so that sexual reproduction failed nearly completely for both species. 3. Vallisneria grown from tubers produced 97% less total tuber mass at pH 5 (0.4 v 14.9 g), the compounded result of producing, on average, 89% fewer and 82% smaller tubers. The smaller tubers developed at pH 5 were less likely to overwinter in the field, and those surviving tubers subsequently grew into smaller plants. 4. These findings generated the hypothesis of a closing spiral: growth at low pH (and relatively low CO2 concentrations) results in small plants that produce a smaller number of progressively smaller tubers each autumn, which in turn develop into progressively smaller plants each summer. This hypothesis was supported by field transplant experiments in two acidic Adirondack Mountain (NY) lakes.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	1993	30	1					63	72		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1993.tb00789.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1993.tb00789.x													WOS:A1993LU38100006
J	Muniz, IP; Framstad, E				Muniz, IP; Framstad, E			Surface water chemistry characteristics in the Lake Storgronningen drainage area, Hoylandet, during periods of high and low discharge	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The surface water chemistry of Hoylandet has been studied by performing two synoptic surveys, during high runoff in the autumn of 1986 and during a low flow period in the summer of 1988. Based on water samples of up to 38 chemical variables from 75 sites, analyses show considerable variation in the chemical composition. There is a strong altitude gradient, i.e. very dilute poorly buffered waters dominate at higher elevations near the timberline while progressively higher salt content and alkalinities are characteristic at lower altitudes more dominated by forests. The influence of mires is less pronounced. The overall water quality is of oligotrophic nature with low concentrations of strong acid anions and metals known to be enriched under acidified conditions. The natural pH gradients are considerable but with no indication of anthropogenic acidification. The data provide little support for the hypothesis that in-catchment production of organically derived acidity leads to acid runoff, which in these catchments appears compensated by increased weathering. The findings are in general accordance with other Hoylandet catchment studies. It is concluded that this area may serve as a representative pristine surface runoff analogue for catchments currently affected by atmospheric deposition of strong mineral acids.																			0018-8158					AUG 1	1997	348						49	68		10.1023/A:1003033132562	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003033132562													WOS:A1997XV67900005
J	Marion, GM				Marion, GM			A theoretical evaluation of mineral stability in Don Juan Pond, Wright Valley, Victoria Land	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Don Juan Pond, located in the Wright Valley, Victoria Land, is unique for several reasons. It is the most saline of the Antarctic lakes, being a near-saturated CaCl2 solution. As a consequence of this high salinity, Don Juan Pond generally remains unfrozen in winter, even at temperatures below -50 degrees C. Don Juan Pond is the site where antarcticite (CaCl2 . 6H(2)O) was first identified forming naturally. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the utility of a chemical thermodynamic model (FREZCHEM) by developing theoretical stability diagrams for ice, halite (NaCl), hydrohalite (NaCl . 2H(2)O), and antarcticite in Don Juan Pond, using experimental data collected on 34 days between 1961 and 1983. The composition of Don Juan Pond at the calculated eutectic temperature (-51.8 degrees C) was CaCl2 = 3.72 mol kg(-1) and NaCl = 0.50 mol kg(-1), which is similar but not identical to a pure NaCl-CaCl2-H2O system. The low eutectic temperature and high CaCl2 concentrations of Don Juan Pond account for lack of freezing during winter. The model is compatible with the experimental data, and predicts the formation of ice during rare high water periods, halite, and antarcticite. These solid phases have all been reported from Don Juan Pond. The model also predicts the formation of hydrohalite at subzero temperatures; hydrohalite has never been observed at Don Juan Pond, but this may simply reflect that most sampling was done during the summer when halite is thermodynamically more stable than hydrohalite. The FREZCHEM model may prove useful in elucidating the physicochemical behaviour, the origin of salinity, and the evolution of Antarctic lakes.																			0954-1020					MAR	1997	9	1					92	99		10.1017/S0954102097000114	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954102097000114													WOS:A1997WM78000011

MIGRATIONS OF BEWICK'S SWAN (CYGNUS BEWICKII): NEW DATA ON TAGGING THE MIGRATION ROUTES, STOPOVERS AND WINTERING SITES	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												To reveal the origin of the breeding sites of a new, growing, wintering population of Bewick's Swan (Cygnus bewickii) in the delta of Evros River, Greece, in the August of 2015 and 2016 we deployed 14 GPS-GSM 30 g transmitters on adult swans moulting at the Baydaraskaya Bay, Yamal Peninsula, Russia. A total of 11 swans were tracked down to their wintering areas. Three very distinct wintering areas were identified: the Evros Delta (eastern Mediterranean), the Volga Delta, northern Caspian Sea (within both Russia and Kazakhstan), Central Asia (Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and westernmost China), and Lake Poyang (Yangtze Basin, China). Bewick's Swans from Yamal were thus found wintering in the Evros Delta for the first time. Altogether, three new migration routes were revealed for this species:western (Evros and Volga deltas), central (Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and westernmost China) and eastern (Lake Poyang). We also investigated the migration track length, the network of stopover sites (14 were identified) and the migration strategy for each of the routes identified. The appearance of new wintering sites (in southeastern Europe and Central Asia) could be related to the remarkable numbers growth of breeding and moulting swans in Yamal along with a strong decrease observed in the population wintering in the North Sea coasts, likely as a result of habitat change. No reliable relation could be established between these two opposite trends. Our results show that Bewick's Swans from the Yamal Peninsula are capable to using a wide range of ecosystems as stopover and wintering sites. A distance of over 8000 km separates the Evros Delta from Lake Poyang. Considering both global warming and the apparent ecological plasticity of the species, its distribution area can be predicted to further expand in the near future, with some stopover areas potentially to be used as wintering sites.

J	Rabette, C; Lair, N				Rabette, C; Lair, N			Influence of abiotic factors on the migration from the sediments of Cyclops vicinus and Chaoborus flavicans in the sub-littoral and profundal zone of an eutrophic temperate lake	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Different studies on the eutrophic Lake Aydat have shown that a part of the planktonic community (4(th) copepodite stage of Cyclops vicinus and 4th instar larvae of Chaoborus flavicans) leaves the open water. In this study the benthic fauna has been related to the environmental variables of this lake. Triplicate samples were collected monthly or bi-monthly from July 94 to August 95 with an Ekman grab at 5 stations from the sub-littoral (- 4 m) to the central part (- 14 m) of the lake. In contrast to progressive oxygen and temperature variations, granulometry is not significantly different from one station to the other. The sub-benthic fauna uses the sediments by two strategies. Previous results have shown that after a reserve accumulation, the 4(th) copepodites burrow during summer into the anoxic sediments and emerge only during the autumnal mixing. During summer, the IVth instar larvae of Chaoborus stay alternately in the oxygenated water and in the anoxic sediments. Their ability to support the permanent anoxia of the deep water is illustrated by their massive burrowing since the reoxygenation occurs. They stay in the sediments until the following spring, when the sediments are again deoxygenated. The timing of their release from the sediments depends on the rise of the oxygen depletion and on the temperature increase of their environment.																			0003-4088						1998	34	3					295	303		10.1051/limn/1998026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/1998026													WOS:000076329200005

Our observations which illustrate the eutrophic status of this lake could be summarized in 3 major sequences: 3 maxima of phytoplanktonic biomass (April, July, September) followed by 3 maxima of zooplanktonic biomass (May, mid-August, October) followed in turn by 3 periods of increased transparency (June, end of August, November). The biomass minimum of phytoplankton in May and the high primary production characterized a genuine clear water phase: the algal succession was controlled by grazing activities. During summer time, phytoplankton was dominated by Cyanophyta and large size algae which then decreased in August. Nitrogen was the first nutrient to be depleted. As a consequence nitrogen fixers became dominant earlier than in the idealized PEG-model. After nitrogen, silicate was the second nutrient that became depleted. A second clear water phase occurred, linked to a high increase in zooplankton and grazing activities. At the beginning of winter, zooplanktonic organization remained important, and grazing drove again the algal succession that was additionally physically controlled. The detritic food chain seems to be the principal source of energy of zooplankton filter-feeders.																			0003-9136					JUN	1989	115	4					589	602																WOS:A1989AF76900007
J	GEDDES, MC				GEDDES, MC			LIMNOLOGY OF LAKE ALEXANDRINA, RIVER MURRAY, SOUTH-AUSTRALIA, AND THE EFFECTS OF NUTRIENTS AND LIGHT ON THE PHYTOPLANKTON	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Lake Alexandrina is a shallow, well-mixed freshwater system at the mouth of the River Murray. Median water renewal time is 109 days. The lake is characterized by high turbidity and high light extinction, with mean values of 93 NTU and 6.54 1n units m-1, respectively. Background extinction is high and the algal biomass contributes little to light extinction. Changes in turbidity reflect disproportionate contributions from the Murray and its major tributary the Darling. Based on total P and total Kjeldahl N levels, the lake is chemically eutrophic-hypertrophic but the N to P ratio is low and levels of filterable and soluble reactive P and especially NO3/NO2-N are often low, suggesting that most of the nutrients are in particulate form and perhaps unavailable for plant growth. From 1975-1978, the ulotrichous green alga Planctonema lauterbornii generally accounted for more than 95% of algal cells. It was growing under conditions of low average irradiance in the mixed water column. Chlorophyll a varied seasonally, with peak values in late spring. The summer drop in chlorophyll a correlated with low availability of nutrients, especially NO3/NO2-N. Low light availability appeared to preclude blue-green algae during the present study although blooms were recorded in 1965-1967 and 1972-1973.																			0067-1940						1984	35	4					399	415																WOS:A1984SW61700002
J	Nevalainen, L; Sarmaja-Korjonen, K				Nevalainen, Liisa; Sarmaja-Korjonen, Kaarina			Intensity of autumnal gamogenesis in chydorid (Cladocera, Chydoridae) communities in southern Finland, with a focus on Alonella nana (Baird)	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												The aim of this study was to examine whether there was variation in the intensity of gamogenesis (sexual reproduction) in communities of chydorid cladocerans during the autumnal sexual reproduction period. The proportions of gamogenetic individuals (i.e., intensity) in the chydorid communities of seven lakes in southern Finland were determined in weekly samples throughout the autumn of 2005. The period of gamogenetic reproduction began very synchronously in the lakes as a response to climatic forcing and proportions of gamogenetic individuals progressively increased towards winter. However, wide variation was found in intensity among the communities. The high intensity probably was a response to some environmental stressors (e.g., invertebrate predation, crowding, competition, or changes in water chemistry) to ensure genetic variability and future populations. One common species, Alonella nana showed exceptional, dualistic, gamogenetic behavior, since in some communities it reproduced with high and in others with extremely low gamogenetic intensity. It is possible that in the former it responded to environmental stressors by exhibiting high intensity of gamogenesis, thus renewing its genotypes, while in the latter it succeeded primarily by parthenogenetic (asexual) reproduction, and was possibly perennial. The high gamogenetic intensity in A. nana was related to dystrophic and mesotrophic conditions, but it correlated positively only with water conductivity.

Urban waterfront spaces not only create pleasant landscape environments and regulate microclimates, but also help to maintain ecological diversity. However, the current high-density urban construction model has led to poor air mobility and weakened water regulation functions in cities. Therefore, the rationalization of the spatial form of settlements has become particularly important in recent times. In this study, the Nan Lake area of Wuhan City was taken as the research object, and it was simulated using ENVI-met (5.5.1) software. Further, the orthogonal experimental design method was combined with the extremum difference analysis method. This study focused on the effects of the layout form (LF), floor area ratio (FAR), green form (GF), and offshore distance (OD) on the temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), and thermal comfort in waterfront settlements in summer. This study found that (1) among the various factors, the effect of the GFs and LFs on the overall microclimate of the study region was the most significant, while the volume ratio had the least significant effect on each indicator. (2) The parallel layout form was found to have better ventilation effects compared to the other three layout forms, with its cooling and humidifying effects being superior. (3) Among the four types of greening combinations, the combination of "grass + shrubs" had the best cooling effect at the height of pedestrians, while trees were able to reduce the heat transfer of solar radiation to the ground due to the shading and evaporation effects provided by their canopies. (4) The cooling and humidifying effects provided by the water body of Nan Lake gradually diminished as the distance from its shore increased; therefore, waterfront settlements maintaining a reasonable proximity to their water bodies will help bring into play the microclimate adjustment effect of such bodies. This study provides a valuable reference for the construction and renewal of urban waterfront settlements in the hot summer and cold winter zones of China (HSCW).																				2071-1050				NOV	2023	15	22							15687	10.3390/su152215687	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su152215687													WOS:001113635900001

Temporal succession of putative glycolate-utilizing bacterioplankton tracks changes in dissolved organic matter in a high-elevation lake	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Shifts in the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) may be a principal factor effecting changes in bacterial community composition. Emerald Lake, a high-elevation lake with DOM dominated by terrestrial sources in the spring with increasing phytoplankton-derived inputs throughout the ice-free season, provided a natural experiment with which to investigate the importance of resource-mediated drivers. Glycolate-utilizing bacteria, a subset of the bacterial community able to use algal exudates, were characterized using DNA analysis of glycolate oxidase subunit D (glcD) genes from Emerald Lake samples collected approximately biweekly from ice-cover (June) through fall turnover (September). glcD genes were not detected in early-season samples when the lake was ice-covered and phytoplankton-derived resources were scarce. Following this period, glcD gene composition exhibited significant changes through time, which were strongly correlated with the combination of fluorescence index, an indicator of the proportion of lake vs. terrestrially derived DOM, and dissolved inorganic nitrate+nitrite. These results suggest that seasonal shifts in DOM source and environmental variables that affect the composition of algal-derived dissolved resources drive changes in the relative abundance and composition of putative glycolate-utilizing bacteria. These findings strengthen the evidence for shifts in DOM structuring bacterial communities.					; Kent, Angela/D-6124-2011; Nelson, Craig/H-3323-2019	Paver, Sara/0000-0001-6062-346X; Nelson, Craig/0000-0003-2525-3496; Kent, Angela/0000-0003-1837-2382													0168-6496	1574-6941				MAR	2013	83	3					541	551		10.1111/1574-6941.12012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1574-6941.12012								22984851					WOS:000314474100002

In the Arctic, past and present glacial retreat leads to isostatic uplift of sediments through which cold and methane-saturated groundwater travels. This fluid reaches the surface and freezes as hill-shaped icings during winter, producing dark ice-water interfaces above water ponds containing chemical energy sources. In one such system characterized by elevated methane concentrations - the Lagoon Pingo in Adventdalen, Svalbard, Norway (similar to 10 mg/L CH4, <0.3 mg/L O-2, -0.25 degrees C, pH 7.9), we studied amplicons of the bacterial and archaeal (microbial) 16S rRNA gene and transcripts in the water pond and overlaying ice. We found that active chemolithoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing microorganisms (Sulfurimonas, Thiomicrorhabdus) dominate a niche at the bottom of the ice that is in contact with the anoxic water reservoir. There, the growing ice offers surfaces that interface with water and hosts favorable physico-chemical conditions for sulfide oxidation. The detection of anaerobic methanotrophs further suggests that throughout the winter, a steady-state dark and cold methane sink occurs under the ice in two steps: first, methane is oxidized to carbon dioxide and sulfates are concomitantly reduced to sulfides by the activity of anaerobic methanotrophs (ANME) ANME-1a and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) SEEP-SRB1 consortia; and second, energy from sulfides is used by sulfur-oxidizing microorganisms to fix carbon dioxide into organic carbon. Our results underscore that ice-covered and dark ecosystems are hitherto overlooked oases of microbial life and emphasize the need to study microbial communities in icy habitats.

J	Yokoyama, A; Park, HD				Yokoyama, A; Park, HD			Mechanism and prediction for contamination of freshwater bivalves (Unionidae) with the cyanobacterial toxin microcystin in hypereutrophic Lake Suwa, Japan	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY												Seasonal changes of microcystin (MC) bioaccumulation in three freshwater Unionid bivalves, Anodonta woodiana, Cristaria plicata, and Unio douglasiae, were investigated in the hypereutrophic Lake Suwa. Total MC concentrations (MC-RR and -LR) as determined by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography were at high levels in the hepatopancreas of C. plicata and U. douglasiae, with maxima at 297 and 420 mug/g dry weight, respectively. The amounts and seasonal changes in the accumulated MC concentration differed in all species. The total MC concentration of A. woodiana was always less than that of other species (maximum concentration of 12.6 mug/g dry weight). The toxin concentration of C. plicata remained very low in summer, when the Microcystis bloom occurred, but increased rapidly in autumn, when the toxic bloom disappeared. For U. douglasiae, simple regression analyses were performed to clarify the relationship between MC bioaccumulation and environmental parameters such as water temperature, chlorophyll a, suspended solids (SS), intracellular MC per unit volume of lake water and per-unit weight of SS and extracellular MC. The toxin concentration of U. douglasiae correlated more closely with qualitative factors, with intracellular toxin per SS (p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.72) than with quantitative factors such as chlorophyll a and intracellular toxin per unit volume of lake water. No correlation could be found between MC in the tissues and extracellular MC. These results indicate that a long-term survey is needed to assess the safety of bivalves. The study should take into consideration both interspecific differences in toxin content and what is the optimal monitoring parameter.

These hypotheses were addressed by means of in situ observations that were combined with a three-dimensional lake model of a high-altitude pump-storage reservoir, i.e., Lake Corne, during the ice-free period. The fitted model (Pumping scenario) was used to simulate the hydrodynamics and oxygen concentrations of the lake under natural conditions (without pump-storage). Thereafter, the lake response to direct or catchment-mediated meteorological conditions (e.g., changes in inflows during storms) was investigated with a sensitivity analysis of the forcing parameters under both the pumping and natural hydrological scenarios. The pumping operation resulted in significant changes in water temperature, heat content and water mass stability during summer, as compared to a natural scenario. The lake hydrodynamics during the ice-free season were highly responsive to changes in the summer weather conditions, and more sensitive to realistic changes in cloudiness and water transparency than changes in air temperatures for both the pumped and natural scenarios. The spatial and temporal evolution of dissolved oxygen was comparatively less responsive to summer weather conditions, in both scenarios. The pump-storage operation from Lake Corne had a comparatively smaller effect on the lake functioning than the natural meteorological variability in summer. However, the pump-storage operation decreased the sensitivity of the lake hydrodynamics to changes in water transparency and limited water mass stability during summer.

Fishery biology of the goldfish Carassius auratus (Linnaeus, 1758) in Lake Trasimeno (Umbria, Italy)	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												The fishery biology of the goldfish Carassius auratus was studied in Lake Trasimeno by analysing the selectivity of the equipment that can be used to control this invasive species. Sampling was conducted monthly from February 2003 to January 2004 by means of electrofishing, fyke-nets and gill-nets of different-sized mesh (22, 25, 28, 35, 40, 50, 70 and 80 mm). The average value of the CPUEs of goldfish caught was 10 175.48 g.10(-2.)m(-2) for gill-nets, 246.97 g.h(-1) for fyke-nets and 606.50 g.min(-1) for electrofishing. The efficiency of electrofishing was not uniform in all periods of the year, the mean CPUEs being highest in spring, when specimens of reproductive age were preferentially caught. Gill-nets yielded abundant catches of goldfish in all seasons, and displayed good sampling efficiency even in winter. With regard to the selectivity of gill-nets, estimated optimum selection lengths for each mesh size were: 11.92 cm, 13.55 cm, 15.18 cm, 18.97 cm, 21.68 cm, 27.10 cm, 37.94 cm and 43.36 cm. The results of this research demonstrate that the various fishing techniques can be effectively combined with the aim of controlling the goldfish population in Lake Trasimeno.

It is in a turbid state with permanent cyanobacterial blooms. A slight improvement was detected after diversion in the 1990s of part of the sewage flowing into it. After sewage diversion, we found that: (1) Chlorophyll concentration and rotifer densities decreased; (2) Rotifer proportions declined, due mainly to a relative increase in cladocerans; (3) Rotifer diversity increased. The two dominants of the 1980s, Polyarthra spp. in the colder period and Brachionus angularis in the warmer one, reverted after sewage diversion to a more diverse assemblage reminiscent of the 1970s, with a higher number of dominant species. In the summer of 1998, both Brachionus calyciflorus and its predator Asplanchna brightwelli, dominant in 1973, became abundant again. In 1998, an increase in the number of dominant species was also observed during water renewal periods, some of these species were new or seldomly found before in the lagoon ( Proalides tentaculatus-digitus, Trichocerca pusilla at the end of rice culture, Brachionus variabilis at the end of winter flooding). Another change that indicates an improvement of water conditions is a more distinct and longer clear water phase, which occurs in the water renewal period at the end of winter and involves a Daphnia magna peak. The increased importance of this phase, promoted the flourishment of Brachionus variabilis, a facultative Daphnia epibiont never found before in the lake.

However, knowledge of spatiotemporal patterns of the fish community in non-fed fishery systems remains limited, despite their ecological importance for sustainable aquaculture and fisheries. To elucidate the status of the fisheries and their critical drivers in non-fed fishery systems, hydroacoustic surveys were conducted seasonally in Hongchaojiang Reservoir in two seasons (spring and autumn) of two consecutive years: 2018 and 2019. Results showed that the average fish density in Hongchaojiang Reservoir was 121.6 ind./1000 m(3). Fish communities varied significantly between geographical locations and seasons. On the temporal scale, fish densities in October were higher than those in April. On the spatial scale, fish densities were higher in the upstream (S1 and S3) than those in the midstream (S2, S4, S5, S6), while the density of S7, S8 and S9 in the downstream was the lowest. Trophic level index, zooplankton, chlorophyll-a, and phytoplankton play vital roles in fish distributional patterns, while the target strength, which reflects fish body size, was highly associated with water temperature, dissolved oxygen, total organic carbon, and phytoplankton. These results suggest that the spatiotemporal distribution of the fish community in Hongchaojiang Reservoir was jointly influenced by biotic and abiotic variables of water bodies, and highlight the importance of water nutrient levels and food availability in shaping fish distribution in the non-fed aquaculture system. This study should improve our understanding of ecological patterns and dominant drivers in fish stocks and provide information for successful sustainable management in non-fed purification fisheries.					; Wang, Dapeng/JVZ-9338-2024; WANG, Gongpei/ISA-8425-2023; Zhou, Lei/CAG-2700-2022	zhou, Lei/0000-0002-3995-1087; 														1424-2818				AUG	2023	15	8							886	10.3390/d15080886	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d15080886													WOS:001055346000001

TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												During the first winter of life, loss of energy reserves as a function of low feeding activity and scarce prey may contribute to high mortality of age-0 largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides. To explore how two current bioenergetics models predict winter energy depletion, we quantified growth and consumption by age-0 largemouth bass from Alabama, Ohio, and Wisconsin fed maintenance rations in 55-L, aquaria in three simulated winters mimicking temperatures and photoperiods at low temperate latitudes (Alabama; 33 degrees N), middle latitudes (Ohio; 40 degrees N), and high temperate latitudes (Wisconsin; 46 degrees N). We compared observed growth in aquaria with that predicted by putting observed consumption into both models. During winter 1995-1996, we validated one of the models with a separate pool experiment (5,800-L) in which age-0 largemouth bass were fed either at 0.5 X or 1.5 X maintenance ration. In aquaria, energy density of the largemouth bass declined in the high- and middle- but not in the low-latitude winter. Though error was slight in the low- and middle-latitude winters for one of the models, both models underestimated growth in the high-latitude winter. To fit the model to the data, the function that estimates weight-specific resting metabolism had to be reduced by about 16%. In pools, where we predicted consumption from observed growth, the model adequately predicted consumption by largemouth bass fed 1.5 X maintenance, but overestimated consumption by 0.5 X maintenance individuals. Current bioenergetics models perform poorly at the cold temperatures (<6 degrees C), photoperiods, and low prey abundances typical of high-latitude lakes, likely because metabolic costs are overestimated.

The sediment sequence was deposited between 12,300 and 8850 C-14 BP, covering the Allerod, Younger Dryas, and early-Holocene periods. The first Trichoptera were recorded at 12,000 C-14 BP, and during the Allerod a diverse assemblage of Limnephilidae taxa developed in the lake. By about 11,400 C-14 BP the relatively thermophilous Polycentropus flavomaculatus and Limnephilus rhombicus were present, suggesting that the summer water temperature was at least 17 degrees C. This temperature fell by 5-8 degrees C at the start of the Younger Dryas, and the thermophilous taxa were replaced within 20-40 C-14 yrs by Apatania spp., including the arctic-alpine A. zonella, suggesting a maximum summer water temperature of 10-12 degrees C. The Trichoptera assemblage was impoverished in numbers and in diversity over the next 200 yrs as the severe conditions of the Younger Dryas developed. As soon as temperatures rose and glacial meltwater and silt input ended about 700 C-14 yrs later, the resident Apatania assemblage expanded immediately, within 10 yrs. About 130 yrs later, thermophilous taxa replaced Apatania, and a much more diverse assemblage than in the Allerod occupied the varied habitats made available by the development of the Holocene lake ecosystem. The 130 yr delay may have been caused by a gradual temperature increase crossing a critical threshold, or by the time taken for thermophilous taxa to migrate from their Younger Dryas refugia.

Size-Dependent Dry Deposition of Airborne Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers in Urban Guangzhou, China	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Gaseous and size-segregated particulate PBDEs (specifically BDE-47, -99, -183, -207, and -209) in the air were measured in urban Guangzhou at 100 and 150 m above the ground in daytime and at night in August and December 2010, to assess dry deposition of these contaminants accurately with regards to influences of meteorological factors but without confounding surface effects. Particulate PBDEs were more abundant at night than in daytime, and slightly higher in winter than in summer, likely from varying meteorological conditions and atmospheric boundary layers. More than 60% of particulate-phase PBDEs was contained in particles with an aerodynamic diameter (D-P) below 1.8 mu m, indicating long-range transport potential. The average daily particle dry deposition fluxes of PBDEs in August ranged from 2.6 (BDE-47) to 88.6 (BDE-209) ng m(-2) d(-1), while those in winter ranged from 2.0 (BDE-47) to 122 (BDE-209) ng m(-2) d(-1). Deposition fluxes of all PBDE congeners were significantly higher in daytime than at night for both months, due to the effect of diurnal variability of meteorological factors. In addition, mean overall particle deposition velocities of individual BDE congeners ranged from 0.11 to 0.28 cm s(-1). These values were within a factor of 2 of assumed values previously used in southern China and the Laurentian Great Lakes, suggesting that such assumptions were reasonable for sites with similar particulate size distributions and PBDE sources. Dry deposition velocities of PBDEs were lower at night than those in the daytime, probably reflecting higher mechanical and thermal turbulence during daytime. Dry deposition of particulate-bound PBDEs is influenced by short-term temporal variability from meteorological factors, and also by particulate size fractions.

This is the first report of a natural infection of PKX in either captive or wild sockeye salmon. All 14 underyearling kokanee salmon and the one underyearling chinook salmon exhibited numerous PKX organisms and associated chronic inflammation in the renal interstitium. Thirty-eight percent of sexually mature kokanee salmon collected in the autumn of 1993 from Comox Lake (which drains into the Puntledge River) were infected with Sphaerospora oncorhynchi, Kent, Whitaker and Margolis, 1993 in the renal tubules, while immature cutthroat trout (O. clarki) and coho salmon (O. kisutch) from the same collection did not exhibit myxosporean spores in the kidney. The kidneys of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and prickly sculpin (Cottus asper) collected from the Puntledge River during the summer were all infected with a Myxobilatus sp., but no organisms suggestive of PKX or Sphaerospora were observed. This study further supports the hypothesis that PKX is a developmental stage of S. oncorhynchi, which may sporulate only in sexually mature salmonids.																			0706-652X						1995	52			1			13	17		10.1139/f95-503	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f95-503													WOS:A1995RW48200005

SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION AND HABITAT PREFERENCES OF WINTERING WATERFOWL IN CENTRAL BOHEMIA	ACTA ZOOLOGICA ACADEMIAE SCIENTIARUM HUNGARICAE					5th Conference of Societas-Internationalis-Limnologiae (SIL)	AUG 26-30, 2006	Aqua Birds Working Grp, Eger, HUNGARY	Soc Int Limnol	Aqua Birds Working Grp			A Winter Waterfowl Census in Central Bohemia was carried out in Central Bohemia in the seasons 2003/04 and 2004/05 once a month between the middle of November and the middle of March, 270 km of four rivers and 31 reservoirs were a subject of investigation. The course of temperature in the studied winters was very different and influenced total abundance as well as spatial distribution of particular species. We distinguished species assemblages characteristic for different types of winter sites. Anas platyrhynchos was a dominant species in all localities. Cygnus olor, Larus ridibundus, and Fulica atra were found on rivers within human settlements, especially on the Vltava River in Prague. Aythya ferina and A. fuligula were the other dominant species in Prague. A river section representing the largest river flow was characterized by Bucephala clangula. Mergus merganser were found on all rivers. The only little river was characterized with a high density of Cinclus cinclus. A deep and large drinking-water reservoir with rugged banks hosted northern diving species (M. merganser, B. clangula, Melanita fusca, Gavia arctica). Sand pit lakes were important resting sites (e.g. for M. merganser, A. ferina, A. fuligula and A. platyrhynchos). Fishponds were characterized by A. platyrhynchos and the largest fishpond also by Anser fabalis and A. albifrons.																			1217-8837						2008	54						95	109																WOS:000266462100011

An analysis based on satellite observations in synergy with hydrodynamic modelling and in-situ data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Phytoplankton growth depends on various factors, and primarily on nutrient availability, light and water temperature, whose distributions are largely controlled by hydrodynamics. Our main objective is to analyse the link between spatial and temporal variability of surface water temperature and algal concentration in a large lake by means of remote sensing and hydrodynamic modelling. We compare ten years of satellite images showing chlorophyll concentrations and surface water temperature of Lake Geneva. Our observations suggest different correlations depending on the season. Elevated chlorophyll concentrations in spring are correlated with warmer zones. But, in summer, higher chlorophyll concentrations are observed in colder zones. We show with a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model that the spatial variability of the surface water temperature reflects the upwelling and downwelling zones resulting from wind forcing. In springtime, nearshore downwellings induce locally increased surface temperature and stratification, which are associated with high chlorophyll concentration. In summertime, colder surface temperature area, often interpreted as transient upwellings, represents the thermal surface signature of wind-induced basin-scale internal waves, bringing either nutrients or phytoplankton from deeper layers to the surface. Our study suggests the latter to be the dominant process, with the basin-scale internal wave activity and associated transient summertime upwellings and downwellings having little net effects on the algal concentration. This study finally demonstrates the necessity to connect remote sensing retrievals and three-dimensional hydrodynamic modelling to properly understand the dynamic of the lake ecosystems.

Hazard assessment investigations due to recent changes in Triftgletscher, Bernese Alps, Switzerland	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The details and the consequences of the recent retreat of Triftgletscher (Gadmertal, Bernese Alps, Switzerland) have been investigated. Geodetic volume changes indicate a strong decrease since 1929 while the position of the terminus remained practically unchanged until 1990. The role played by calving in the tongue retreat running from 2000 to 2006 is confirmed by means of a mass balance model including a calving criterion. Results show that without calving, it would have taken two years longer for the lake to form than has been observed. The consequences of the ensuing tongue destabilization are surveyed, first with an ice avalanche model and second with a hydraulic study of the potential impulse wave triggered by the impact of the falling ice mass in the lake. Results point out that ice avalanches with volumes greater that 1.10(6) m(3) will flow into the lake and that in the worst scenario, a discharge of 400 m(3) s(-1) is expected to reach the endangered area in Gadmertal 11 min after the break-off. In order to detect surface motion precursors to such ice avalanches, a photographic monitoring system was installed. The results indicate seasonal variations with peak velocity in summer and no significant change during the other months. Spectacular velocity increases were not observed so far.

Tree-rings stable isotope (d18O and d2H) based 368 years long term precipitation reconstruction of South Eastern Kashmir Himalaya	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The hydroclimatic variability in Kashmir Himalaya is influenced by the western disturbances and the Indian Summer Monsoon. To investigate long-term hydroclimatic variability, 368 years tree-ring oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios (d(18)O and d(2)H) extending from 1648 to 2015 CE were analysed. These isotopic ratios are calculated using five core samples of Himalayan silver fir (Abies pindrow) collected from the south-eastern region of Kashmir valley. The relation-ship between the long and short periodicity components of d(18)O and d(2)H suggested that physiological processes had a minimum effect on the tree-ring stable isotopes in Kashmir Himalaya. The d(18)O chronology was developed based on the average of five-individual tree-ring d(18)O time series covering the time span of 1648-2015 CE. The climate response analysis revealed the strongest and most significant negative correlation between tree ring d(18)O and precipitation amount from the previous year's December to current year's August (D2A(pre)). The reconstructed D2A(pre )(D2A(rec)) ex-plains precipitation variability from 1671 to 2015 CE and is supported by historical and other proxy-based hydrocli-matic records. The reconstruction has two distinguishing features: first, it is characterized by stable wet conditions during the last phase of Little Ice Age (LIA) i.e., from 1682 to 1841 CE; and second, the southeast Kashmir Himalaya had experienced drier conditions as compared to recent and historical period with intense pluvial events since 1850. The present reconstruction shows, there have been more extreme dry events than extreme wet events since 1921. A tele-connection is observed between D2A(rec )and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) of the Westerly region.

J	Aulagnier, F; Poissant, L				Aulagnier, F; Poissant, L			Some pesticides occurrence in air and precipitation in Quebec, Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Air and precipitation samples were collected in three stations located in Quebec between January 1993 and March 1996 to determine spatial and seasonal variations of several organochlorine pesticides and metabolites (alpha-HCH, gamma-HCH, HCB, gamma-chlordane, DDT, DDE, Mirex). alpha-HCH, gamma-HCH, and HCB were more or less measured in large amounts at all sites, whereas gamma-chlordane, DDT, and DDE concentrations were lower and Mirex was undetectable. Higher concentrations levels were observed in air during hot spring/summer periods except for HCB, indicating a probable temperature dependence. Ln concentrations vs reciprocal temperature plots and Henry's law determinations helped to highlight the contribution of soil and/or water volatilization of those compounds. It was observed that alpha-HCH came mainly from Atlantic Ocean volatilization at Mingan, whereas sources of gamma-chlordane and DDE were mostly due to volatilization from soils in southern Quebec. DDT may be present in the atmosphere by the way of transport from remote regions. Lindane sources were multiple: it may be found in the atmosphere by the processes of transport and volatilization coming from soil or water. Finally, a negative correlation between HCB and air temperature implies that processes other than volatilization are involved in transport of this compound.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				MAY 1	2005	39	9					2960	2967		10.1021/es048361s	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es048361s								15926539					WOS:000228781700021

The goal was to reconstruct the palaeoclimate, palaeoenvironment and tectonic history and to understand the role these factors played in the geomorphological evolution of the area during the Holocene. Palaeoclimatic interpretations also shed light on the factors responsible for the rise and fall of the Harappan civilisation. The results obtained based on multiproxy studies show five climatic phases during the last 11,000 yr BP. Phase 1 (similar to 11,000 cal yr BP) represents a very humid climate and high precipitation/discharge leading to high lake stand as attested by the high pollen concentration of semi-evergreen tree taxa, phytoliths belonging to cool and moist grasses, and large proportion of algae, marking the onset of Holocene. In phase 2 (similar to 8000 to 9000 cal yr BP) a significantly reduced yield of pollen, phytoliths and aquatic algae indicates shrinkage of the lake. Phase 3 (similar to 7630 cal yr BP) shows moderate yield of pollen and phytolith pointing towards fluctuating precipitation conditions. Phase 4 (similar to 5864 to 4680 cal yr BP) shows very low pollen and phytolith counts, indicating a very dry spell. Finally, phase 5 (similar to 4680 to 3500 cal yr BP) shows a good density and diversity of flora. The wet climate and high lake stand similar to 11,000 cal yr BP, 7630 cal yr BP and after similar to 4680 cal yr BP are synchronous with the lacustrine, marine and aeolian records of western India. The contribution of winter precipitation at 7630 cal yr BP and after similar to 4680 cal yr BP can be correlated with similar records from Rajasthan Lake. Decrease in the precipitation activity, the low lake stand and the onset of dry climatic condition between 8000 and 9000 cal yr BP corresponds to a near global anomaly of this period. Another dry event between similar to 5864 and 4680 cal yr BP documented in Pariyaj Lake record is synchronous with various proxy records of the mid-late Holocene Afro-Asiatic monsoonal belt.

Berry		MIDGE Sci Team	An englacial hydrologic system of brine within a cold glacier: Blood Falls, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Taylor Glacier hosts an active englacial hydrologic system that feeds Blood Falls, a supraglacial outflow of iron-rich subglacial brine at the terminus, despite mean annual air temperatures of -17 degrees C and limited surface melt. Taylor Glacier is an outlet glacier of the East Antarctic ice sheet that terminates in Lake Bonney, McMurdo Dry Valleys. To image and map the brine feeding Blood Falls, we used radio echo sounding to delineate a subhorizontal zone of englacial brine upstream from Blood Falls and elongated in the ice flow direction. We estimate volumetric brine content in excess of 13% within 2 m of the central axis of this zone, and likely much higher at its center. Brine content decreases, but remains detectable, up to 45 m away along some transects. Hence, we infer a network of subparallel basal crevasses allowing injection of pressurized subglacial brine into the ice. Subglacial brine is routed towards Blood Falls by hydraulic potential gradients associated with deeply incised supraglacial valleys. The brine remains liquid within the subglacial and englacial environments through latent heat of freezing coupled with elevated salt content. Our findings suggest that cold glaciers could support freshwater hydrologic systems through localized warming by latent heat alone.

This study examined the brown trout (Salmo trutta) and native taxa ecology in two adjacent but contrasting rivers of Chilean Patagonia. During spring 2016 and spring-fall 2017 we examined the variation in benthic macroinvertebrate and fish community composition and characterized fish size structure, stomach contents, and stable isotopes (delta 13C and delta 15N) to understand population structure, fish diet, and trophic interactions between S. trutta and native taxa. The native Galaxias maculatus (puye) dominated the fish community (74% of abundance). S. trutta was less abundant (16% of survey catch) but dominated the fish community (over 53%) in terms of biomass. S. trutta showed distinct diets (stomach content analysis) in the two rivers, and individuals from the larger river were notably more piscivorous, consuming native fish with a relatively small body size (<100-mm total length). Native fishes were isotopically distinct from S. trutta, which showed a wider isotopic niche in the smaller river, indicating that their trophic role was more variable than in the larger river (piscivorous). This study provides data from the unstudied pristine coastal rivers in Patagonia and reveals that interactions between native and introduced species can vary at very local spatial scales.

Water samples for biological and physicochemical analyses were collected vertically from the water column. Several phytoplankton groups were identified during the study, however, only two main groups of motile phytoplankton, Cyanophyceae (the dominant species - Planktothrix rubescens) and Cryptophyceae (Cryptomonas spp. and Plagioselmis nannoplanctica), were analyzed in the gradient of nutrients, light and thermal conditions. In the studied water column, values of physicochemical parameters did not vary in a wide range. Nevertheless, high discrepancies were noted in the values of phytoplankton biomass and the concentration of chlorophyll-a which had shallower maxima and deeper minima. Statistically significant relationships were found between the biomass of two main phytoplankton groups, light conditions (PAR) and depth, however, no significant relationships were found between the biomass, biogenic compounds and water temperature. The studies showed that in the winter season with ice/snow cover, cryptomonads and Planktothrix rubescens occupied different ecological niches and the main factor determining their distribution were light conditions. The ice/snow cover probably plays an important role in protection of P. rubescens winter filaments against photoinhibition.

The parasite infrapopulations exhibited a marked seasonal regime in infestation pattern as the infection indices increased to a much higher plateau during summer season at all the lakes, while the lows were recorded in winter. The heterogeneity in infection pattern indicates that water temperature is an important determinant of the seasonality of infrapopulations at all the localities. Furthermore, the results of our work clearly indicate that the parasite infrapopulations increased proportionally with eutrophication level and, as such, the highly eutrophic habitat, Anchar Lake, was significantly more favourable for parasite infrapopulations than the less eutrophic ones. However, the lakes presented no significant interlake differences in water temperature. Therefore, we could argue that interlake differences in the infestation pattern of parasite can be safely attributed to respective water quality in the lakes rather than water temperature. We propose that infrapopulations of the diplozoid studied herein do respond to differences in water quality of lakes and, thus, could qualify as simple and reliable indicator species in short-term comparative assays by lake managers.

Bacterial settling occurs in pulses in response to lake dynamics. Two main annual events affect particle settling in Lake La Cruz: (1) Following an event of massive calcium precipitation in summer that caused water whiting, a maximum flux of chlorophyll a and derivatives towards the sediment was registered. Although whiting is accompanied by massive phytoplankton biomass sinking, it was not followed by concomitant photosynthetic bacterial sinking. (2) In contrast, the disruption of the chemocline and the contact of bacterial populations with oxygenated waters during autumn overturn provoked a destruction of the sulfur bacterial plate, causing mass mortality, registered in the settling material as photosynthetic pigments and their derivatives from phototrophic bacteria. Among the bacteriochlorophyll a oxidation products, bacterioviridin (bvir) was detected in high relative abundance in the settled material collected by sediment traps. The much increased flux of bvir after thermal overturn, associated with mass mortality of the purple sulfur bacterium, Amoebobacter purpureus, confirms the suitability of this molecule as a useful paleoindicator of the degree of oxygen exposure experienced by the purple sulfur bacteria population.					; Miracle, Maria/G-3482-2016; Camacho, Antonio/I-3417-2015; Romero-Viana, Lidia/L-9572-2014	Vicente-Pedros, Eduardo/0000-0002-8814-9912; Camacho, Antonio/0000-0003-0841-2010; 													0921-2728					JAN	2006	35	1					167	177		10.1007/s10933-005-8145-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-005-8145-8													WOS:000233939300011

The results showed that salt dust storm in the Ebinur Lake region presented a fluctuating process during 1957-2007, in which 1975 and 2000 were the two cut-off points. During 1975-2000, there were very frequent storms, and the average annual number of salt dust storm days was 10-48, while the average annual number of storm days was not more than 12 both before 1975 and after 2000. The annual variation of salt dust storm displayed a double-peak pattern, of which storm in spring accounted for 62-90 % of the total dust storm days of a year, and that in autumn accounted for 7-13 %. Among the meteorological factors, strong winds had the greatest impact on salt dust storm, followed by temperature and precipitation. For the anthropogenic factors, agricultural acreage exhibited the strongest influence on salt dust storm, followed by lake surface area and population number, while livestock number showed the smallest effect.					; Liu, Dongwei/AAB-9976-2021	Liu, Dongwei/0000-0002-1213-6795; ji, li li/0000-0001-8483-1554; 													0921-030X	1573-0840				JUN	2015	77	2					1069	1080		10.1007/s11069-015-1642-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-015-1642-9													WOS:000353803700029

During winter and the clear water phase in June the netplankton (.gtoreq. 30 .mu.m) provided the bulk primary production (43-83%). However, during summer stratification (May-October 1984) the phytoplankton .ltoreq. 30 .mu.m, mainly diatoms and flagellates, contributed 60-100% to the total primary production, reflecting the high amount of 60-90% (45-90%) to the total biomass (chlorophyll-a) concentration. Throughout the year the relative percentage of the picoplankton (.ltoreq. 3 .mu.m) to primary production was 34% (2-62%), and the smallest size fractions, .ltoreq. 0.8 .mu.m and .ltoreq. 0.2 .mu.m, contributed .ltoreq. 12% and .ltoreq. 6%, respectively. Vertical and temporal changes in light intensity did not significantly influence the patterns of size distributions. The relative importance of nanno- and picoplankton for primary production is not only dependent on the trophic state of a lake, but also on the ecological stress such as nutrient supply, turbulence, and zooplankton grazing.																			0003-9136					JUL	1989	116	1					1	21																WOS:A1989AH77600001

During these 3 years, 59-62 lake and river/stream sites were sampled eight times and screened for 17 pesticides commonly used in Arkansas. Pesticides were extracted by solid-phase extraction (SPE) disks. Extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography-electron capture detection (ECD) and high-performance liquid chromatography-UV detection (LCUV). Detections were confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (MS) or ca-chromatography. The 256 detections during the survey represented 14 pesticides. Metolachlor (25% of total detections), atrazine (22%), norflurazon (16%), and cyanazine (14%) were the most commonly detected compounds. A total of 5% of the total detections was above health advisories. Spring and summer samples provided 73% of the total pesticide detections. Rivers and streams were responsible for 62% of the detections. The highest number of repeated detections of the same pesticide at a site was for cyanazine (six of eight sampling periods).

In this study, we identified the variations in vegetation phenology and showed its correlation with snow cover for varied underlying conditions and elevation zones in the Qilian Mountains (QLMs) in northern parts of the QTP based on the MODIS NDVI product (MOD13Q1) and snow cover area dataset. Partial correlation analysis demonstrated that end of snow cover (SCE) is negatively correlated to the start of the growing season (SOS) in relatively higher mountains, but it is positively correlated to SOS around Qinghai Lake and eastern Lenglongling Mountain. On the contrary, the snow cover duration (SCD) is positively correlated with the length of the growing season (LOS) in most parts of the QLMs, but it is negatively correlated with LOS in Lenglongling Mountain and around Qinghai Lake. The influences of snow cover on vegetation phenology depend on the underlying surface conditions which are evidenced by a stronger correlation between the start of snow cover and SCD and SOS of grassland than that of brushland, cropland, and woodland, while the influences of SCE on vegetation phenology are weak. The correlation between snow parameters and vegetation phenological events is significant on the south slopes 30 degrees C with elevation zones of 3500-4200 m asl and < 2800 m asl. The results of the study are significant for facilitating research in the management of the cold region eco-environment in the QLMs.					张, 金龙/HHY-8484-2022														1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2021	133								108351	10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108351	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108351		NOV 2021											WOS:000719795700004

Effects of a Small, Century-old Dam on a Second-order Stream in the Virginia Piedmont	SOUTHEASTERN GEOGRAPHER												The geomorphology, hydrology, and ecology of a second-order stream in central Virginia were compared to that of an adjacent reference stream in order to determine the impact of a small, 100-yr-old dam. The dam had little effect on stage hydrographs, but surface release of water resulted in temperatures 2-5 degrees C warmer than the reference stream during spring and summer months. Stream geomorphology was not highly altered by the dam, being influenced more strongly by valley geology and topography, but riffle sediment size distributions were affected by sediment trapping in the reservoir. Macroinvertebrate populations just below the dam appeared impaired, while sites 8 km downstream and on the reference stream scored well on ecological metrics. Bluegill fish (Lepomis macrochirus) which likely originate in the lake were abundant in the dammed creek, whereas the reference stream was dominated by native dace (Phoxinus and Rhinichthys spp.) and creek chubs (Semotilus atromaculatus). Overall, the impact of the dam on the creek is only moderate and declines significantly within 8 km downstream.																			0038-366X	1549-6929				NOV	2007	47	2					181	201		10.1353/sgo.2007.0018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/sgo.2007.0018													WOS:000420790200001
J	Fernández, JE; Peeters, F; Hofmann, H				Fernandez, Jorge Encinas; Peeters, Frank; Hofmann, Hilmar			Importance of the Autumn Overturn and Anoxic Conditions in the Hypolimnion for the Annual Methane Emissions from a Temperate Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Changes in the budget of dissolved methane measured in a small temperate lake over 1 year indicate that anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion and the autumn overturn period represent key factors for the overall annual methane emissions from lakes. During periods of stable stratification, large amounts of methane accumulate in anoxic deep waters. Approximately 46% of the stored methane was emitted during the autumn overturn, contributing similar to 80% of the annual diffusive methane emissions to the atmosphere. After the overturn period, the entire water column was oxic, and only 1% of the original quantity of methane remained in the water column. Current estimates of global methane emissions assume that all of the stored methane is released, whereas several studies of individual lakes have suggested that a major fraction of the stored methane is oxidized during overturns. Our results provide evidence that not all of the stored methane is released to the atmosphere during the overturn period. However, the fraction of stored methane emitted to the atmosphere during overturn may be substantially larger and the fraction of stored methane oxidized may be smaller than in the previous studies suggesting high oxidation losses of methane. The development or change in the vertical extent and duration of the anoxic hypolimnion, which can represent the main source of annual methane emissions from small lakes, may be an important aspect to consider for impact assessments of climate warming on the methane emissions from lakes.

The 28-day integrated concentrations of most PAHs showed significant seasonal trends with higher concentrations in the winter and lower concentrations in the summer. Longterm decreasing trends were observed for all PAHs measured in precipitation at Chicago. At the sites on Lakes Superior, Michigan, and Erie, most PAHs did not show significant long-term trends. At the two Canadian sites on Lakes Huron and Ontario, lower molecular weight PAHs (e.g., fluorene to pyrene) showed long-term decreasing trends; however, no long-term trends were observed for higher molecular weight PAHs at these sites. Interestingly, retene, a marker for wood burning, showed increasing trends at the sites on Lakes Superior and Michigan. For all the other PAHs, precipitation collected at Chicago had by far the highest PAH concentrations followed by the site on Lake Erie. Generally, the Lake Superior sites had the lowest PAH concentrations. However, retene concentrations in precipitation collected at the Lake Superior site were higher compared to Lakes Michigan and Erie, which indicate more residential wood burning in the far north of the Great Lakes basin.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				FEB 1	2006	40	3					696	701		10.1021/es0514949	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es0514949								16509305					WOS:000235227600018

Declines in populations of a number of bird species have been witnessed both in the United States and abroad, with up to a 48% decline in grassland birds of the Central U.S. Understanding changes in bird abundance and distribution is essential because birds supply a wide variety of critical ecosystem services, including pollination and pest control. While the effects of climate change on many bird species' phenology have been studied intensely, research on the family Icteridae is limited. This study was conducted using spring bird presence and absence data and weather data from Oak Lake Field Station from 1995 to 2012. Linear regression analysis was applied against warmth sum days for the 30 days prior to each spring bird survey. Our analysis demonstrated significant increases in accumulated warmth sum days between 1999 and 2012 (P = 0.01). Icterid species richness also increased with increasing warmth sum days during the month leading up to surveys (P = 0.02). Trends in both habitat (open woodland, marsh, and grassland) and feeding guild (insectivores and omnivores) species richness were also observed with increasing warmth sum days. These findings suggest a shift towards earlier spring arrival of members of the family Icteridae in eastern South Dakota.																			0096-378X	0096-1947					2013	92						105	115																WOS:000432620600008

Changes in the Community Structure of Under-Ice and Open-Water Microbiomes in Urban Lakes Exposed to Road Salts	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Salinization of freshwater is increasingly observed in regions where chloride de-icing salts are applied to the roads in winter, but little is known about the effects on microbial communities. In this study, we analyzed the planktonic microbiomes of four lakes that differed in degree of urbanization, eutrophication and salinization, from an oligotrophic reference lake with no surrounding roads, to a eutrophic, salinized lake receiving runoff from a highway. We tested the hypothesis that an influence of road salts would be superimposed on the effects of season and trophic status. We evaluated the microbial community structure by 16S rRNA sequencing for Bacteria, and by four methods for eukaryotes: 16S rRNA chloroplast analysis, 18S rRNA sequencing, photosynthetic pigment analysis and microscopy. Consistent with our hypothesis, chloride and total nitrogen concentrations were among the most important statistical factors explaining the differences in taxonomic composition. These factors were positively correlated with the abundance of cryptophytes, haptophytes, and cyanobacteria. Ice-cover was also a major structuring factor, with clear differences between the winter communities and those of the open-water period. Nitrifying and methane oxidizing bacteria were more abundant in winter, suggesting the importance of anaerobic sediment processes and release of reduced compounds into the ice-covered water columns. The four methods for eukaryotic analysis provided complementary information. The 18S rRNA observations were strongly influenced by the presence of ribosome-rich ciliates, but revealed a much higher degree of taxonomic richness and greater separation of lakes, seasonal changes and potential salinity effects than the other methods.					; Lovejoy, Connie/A-3756-2008; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019	Fournier, Isabelle/0000-0002-0065-2338; 														1664-302X				MAR 31	2021	12								660719	10.3389/fmicb.2021.660719	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.660719								33868217					WOS:000639809400001
J	Bergmann, F				Bergmann, F			Long-term increase in numbers of early-fledged Reed Warblers (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) at Lake Constance (Southern Germany)	JOURNAL FUR ORNITHOLOGIE												Data from a standardized mist-netting programme (the so-called "MRI-Programm") were used to assess the timing of breeding in Reed Warblers (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) at Lake Constance (South Germany). The number of Reed Warblers fledged early in the season increased significantly between 1976 and 1997 (r(s) = 0.614; p < 0.01). This is most probably due to a long-term increase in spring temperature as suggested by the high correlation between the number of early-fledged Reed Warblers and mean temperature in the first half of May (r(s) = 0.416; p < 0.01). While in the period from 1961 to 1980 the mean date of spring arrival was on the 26(th) of April, it shifted towards the 19(th) April from 1981 to 1997. However, the number of early-fledged Reed Warblers and the date of spring arrival are not significantly correlated. The lack of a significant correlation may be due to a number of reasons, for instance early arriving birds do not belong to the local population or there could be an observational bias among years. Yet, the most likely explanation is that the timing of breeding in Reed Warblers is triggered by vegetation growth and food supply rather than by the timing of spring arrival. There is growing body of evidence from this and other studies that the:recent climate change is responsible for the shift in both the timing of migration and breeding in birds.																			0021-8375					JAN	1999	140	1					81	86		10.1007/BF02462091	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02462091													WOS:000078676800006

Baltic Population of the Barnacle Goose (Branta leucopsis (Bechstein 1803)) in the Boreal Zone of Northwestern Russia	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												The Barnacle Goose experienced a precipitous depression in numbers in the middle of the last century. The improvement of measures to protect the species in Western European wintering grounds and climate warming in the Arctic caused an increase in the numbers of the species and a southward expansion of the range from the Arctic islands to the mainland coastal tundra over the last decades of the 20th century. Isolated breeding centers of the Barnacle Goose formed in places of migration stopovers on the coasts of the Baltic Sea and in wintering areas on the coasts of the North Sea. Since the last decade of the past century, the species has begun to settle in the boreal zone of Northwestern Russia. Based on original data from the authors and an analysis of the pertinent literature, the process of Barnacle Goose dispersal in Leningrad oblast, the Republic of Karelia, and Murmansk oblast and the change in its status from a rare visitor to a mass migrant and common, but locally spread, breeding species are examined in detail. The main features of the species' phenology, landscape and habitat distribution, and breeding biology are considered. The exponential growth of the abundance of this species occurring synchronously both in the Subarctic and in new nesting sites in the boreal and temperate climatic zones of Europe suggests that an active microevolutionary process is taking place against the background of the impact of climate change and improved protection of the species, thus making it possible to consider the Barnacle Goose as an interesting model species for various populational studies.

Decomposition of old organic matter as a result of deeper active layers in a snow depth manipulation experiment	OECOLOGIA												A snow addition experiment in moist acidic tussock tundra at Toolik Lake, Alaska, increased winter snow depths 2-3 m, and resulted in a doubling of the summer active layer depth. We used radiocarbon (a dagger C-14) to (1) determine the age of C respired in the deep soils under control and deepened active layer conditions (deep snow drifts), and (2) to determine the impact of increased snow and permafrost thawing on surface CO2 efflux by partitioning respiration into autotrophic and heterotrophic components. a dagger C-14 signatures of surface respiration were higher in the deep snow areas, reflecting a decrease in the proportion of autotrophic respiration. The radiocarbon age of soil pore CO2 sampled near the maximum mid-July thaw depth was approximately 1,000 years in deep snow treatment plots (45-55 cm thaw depth), while CO2 from the ambient snow areas was similar to 100 years old (30-cm thaw depth). Heterotrophic respiration a dagger C-14 signatures from incubations were similar between the two snow depths for the organic horizon and were extremely variable in the mineral horizon, resulting in no significant differences between treatments in either month. Radiocarbon ages of heterotrophically respired C ranged from < 50 to 235 years BP in July mineral soil samples and from 1,525 to 8,300 years BP in August samples, suggesting that old soil C in permafrost soils may be metabolized upon thawing. In the surface fluxes, this old C signal is obscured by the organic horizon fluxes, which are significantly higher. Our results indicate that, as permafrost in tussock tundra ecosystems of arctic Alaska thaws, carbon buried up to several thousands of years ago will become an active component of the carbon cycle, potentially accelerating the rise of CO2 in the atmosphere.

Chemical characteristics and limnology of Loskop Dam on the Olifants River (South Africa), in light of recent fish and crocodile mortalities	WATER SA												A declining crocodile population and fish mortalities attributed to pansteatitis, along with increasing blooms of Microcystis aeruginosa and Ceratium hirundinella, have led to serious concerns about water quality in Loskop Dam, on the Olifants River, South Africa. Major impacts include acid mine drainage and eutrophication associated with sewage effluent. However, the specific causes of pansteatitis remain elusive. In 2011 the water chemistry and limnology of Loskop Dam were studied to determine factors that may be influencing aquatic ecosystem health. Long-term monitoring data collected by the Department of Water Affairs were analysed for trends using a seasonal Mann-Kendall trend test, and were used to determine the trophic state of Loskop Dam using the Carlson index. Multiple sites were sampled which showed the reservoir was heterogeneous with regard to nutrient concentrations, algal biomass and dissolved metals. Specifically, the transitional zone was characterised by frequent algal blooms, resulting in fluctuating dissolved oxygen (range = 2.1-14.5 mg/ l) and pH (range = 7.35-10.59) levels. Using total phosphorus, Secchi depth, and chlorophyll-a concentrations, the trophic state of Loskop Dam was classified as meso-to eutrophic. Significant positive trends were observed in total (Tau = 0.422) and dissolved inorganic (Tau = 0.193) phosphorus. The reservoir showed a monomictic pattern of summer stratification (October to April) and holomictic winter circulation (June to July), with an increase in the depth and extent of anoxia in the hypolimnion when compared to previous research. Simultaneous elevated concentrations of manganese (> 370 mu g/ l) and iron in nearbottom water samples coincided with hypolimnetic anoxia. Aluminium concentrations exceeded the target water quality range (> 10 mu g/ l) during summer (December) in both surface and near-bottom water samples. We conclude that fish in Loskop Dam are periodically exposed to several physiological stressors including elevated ammonia, aluminium, iron and manganese and possibly hydrogen sulphide, as well as low dissolved oxygen. While these factors have never individually been linked to pansteatitis, their combined impacts have not been studied. To ensure the sustainability of Loskop Dam, catchment management plans must focus on reducing phosphorus inputs, and continue seeking treatment solutions for mine-water associated with abandoned and working coal mines.

The series is based on two stalagmites, namely, DSY1 and LM2, which were, respectively, obtained from Dongshiya and Laomu caves. The delta O-18 profiles of stalagmite excurse negatively in early Holocene and gradually become positive after around 6.9 ka BP, tracking the change in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation. Moreover, the 'early-Holocene maximum' supported by stalagmite delta O-18 records differs from the 'mid-Holocene maximum' indicated by geological archives, such as lake sediments and loess. This difference may be caused by different definition indicators of monsoon intensity. Stalagmite delta O-18 is relative to EASM intensity, but irrelative to precipitation in the East Asian monsoon region. The time intervals of EASM maximum and Holocene climatic optimum are desynchronized, which is confirmed by the variation in the stalagmite delta C-13 series. Stalagmite delta C-13 and delta O-18 have different variation tendencies. The tendency of delta C-13 in early mid-Holocene was generally light, but it was discontinuity and disrupted by rapid positive shift between 8.2 and 7.7 ka BP. We conclude that a rapid shift of about 8 ka BP is a turning point, before and after which delta(13) C acquires different controlling factors. Stalagmite delta(13) C showed no signs of positive excurse in late Holocene but it exhibited another characteristic, namely, millennial time scale oscillations. The few changes in stalagmite delta(13) C is attributed to weakened insolation during summer in the northern hemisphere, which leads to low evaporation rate, thereby modulating effective humidity change. The edge of the seasonal monsoonal front in northern China during monsoon recession is sensitive to the rain belt and causes the delta(13) C of the stalagmite to fluctuate greatly. This phenomenon shows that the climate in the study area is unstable in the late Holocene					CHENG, HAI/H-3413-2017; Cheng, Hai/H-3413-2017; Edwards, R./I-3124-2014	Cheng, Hai/0000-0002-5305-9458; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				OCT	2018	28	10					1631	1641		10.1177/0959683618782606	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683618782606													WOS:000452156700009
J	Thiéry, A; Puente, L				Thiéry, A; Puente, L			Crustacean assemblage and environmental characteristics of a man-made solar saltwork in southern France, with emphasis on anostracan (Branchiopoda) population dynamics	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Physical and chemical variables, anostracan populations (Artemia parthenogenetica and Branchinella spinosa) and other biota were studied during 1996-1997 in a Camargue saltern (max. depth similar to1 m). The taxonomic composition and density of macroinvertebrates were investigated twice monthly, based on benthic substrate and water column samples. Fauna was composed of three groups in terms of numerical importance. The benthic macroinvertebrates were represented only by nematodes ( 50 ind. m(-2) to > 500 ind. m(-2) in November-December and May respectively). The zooplankton was dominated by crustaceans, one cladoceran, Moina salina (ranging from 670 to 2350 ind. m(-2) in spring), two anostracans, Artemia parthenogenetica ( 50 ind. m(-2) in autumn), and Branchinella spinosa (max. 190 ind. m(-2) in December to absent in April), and two copepods, Cletocamptus retrogressus (max. density 2000 ind. m(-2) in November), and Eurytemora velox (max. density 650 ind. m(-2) in February-March). Insects (Chironomidae, Culicidae) were rare, with mean densities < 1 ind. m(-2). The phenology of each crustacean population is discussed in relation to physical and chemical water variables. Salinity appeared to be of greatest importance regulating the population abundance.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT	2002	486	1					191	200		10.1023/A:1021354903052	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1021354903052													WOS:000179641100020
J	Sahoo, GB; Schladow, SG				Sahoo, G. B.; Schladow, S. G.			Estimation of Heat and Hydrologic Budget of Upper Klamath Lake Oregon, USA Using Updated DLM-WQ Model	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Estimation of lake hydrologic budgets is essential for sustainable water management due to increasing water demand and uncertainties related to climate change. The updated turbulent diffusion transfer algorithms were developed and incorporated in the DLM-WQ model developed at UC Davis to estimate the Upper Klamath Lake's dynamics, and heat and hydrologic budget. The exchange coefficients for latent heat (C-EN), sensible heat (C-HN), and wind drag (C-D) of the turbulent diffusion model were calibrated using coefficient of correlation as the objective function. The agreement between estimated and measured lake water elevation and temperature are found to be excellent with correlation coefficients 0.99 and 0.95, respectively. The heat and hydrologic budgets are more sensitive to evaporative heat loss (35 %) than sensible heat exchanges (11 %). The stream inflow and lake outflow dominate the hydrologic budget with approximately 47 % due to stream inflow and approximately 44 % due to lake outflow. Precipitation directly on the lake and evaporation from the lake are only 3 % and 6 %, respectively. The lake mixes to the bottom sporadically during spring and summer. Estimated deep mixing for the period 1994-1996 shows the lake's increasing stability without a deep mixing event for approximately 4 months during summer in 1996. Prolonged stratification in the hypereutrophic lake is expected to lead to hypoxia near the sediment surface resulting in exacerbation of existing ecological problems. The DLM-WQ model can be applied to a broad range of lakes/reservoirs with selection of appropriate C-EN and C-HN value for lake/reservoir dynamics and water resources planning evaluation.																			0920-4741	1573-1650				MAR	2014	28	5					1395	1414		10.1007/s11269-014-0559-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-014-0559-5													WOS:000333522400013

However, the relationship between the spatial distribution of wind-pollinated pollen and monsoon has seldom been illustrated quantitatively. Here, we used 676 surface samples (647 compiled, 29 new samples) to examine the characteristics of the spatial distribution patterns of 13 anemophilous pollen taxa on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, by employing the spatial interpolation technique. Then, we quantified the correlation between the distributions of these taxa and monsoon wind via Mantel test. The results show that the anemophilous pollen represents at least half percentage of the total pollen assemblages in most areas of the study region. Anemophilous tree pollen mainly distributes in the south and southeastern part, while anemophilous non-tree pollen does in the opposite and perpendicular direction. The distributional pattern of non-anemophilous pollen reflects that their corresponding plants most likely constitute the understory components of different forests or the minorities of non-forests communities. Mantel tests indicate that the anemophilous tree pollen has a highest correlation with the Asian summer monsoon. Anemophilous pollen, overall pollen assemblages and anemophilous pollen with air sacs have higher correlations with summer monsoon. Contrarily, non-anemophilous pollen has relatively weak correlation. Furthermore, we found that the relationships between various pollen groups or separate taxa and the Asian summer monsoon are dependent on sample types. The lake sediment surface samples had the strongest signal of the Asian summer monsoon among the different sample types. Our findings provide the strong evidence of the Asian summer monsoon influencing the pollen distribution patterns. More importantly, the quantification of this correlation between anemophilous tree pollen and the Asian summer monsoon offers the fundamentally theoretical basis of reconstructing paleo-monsoon by the proxy of windborne pollen taxa.

Heat and mass fluxes	NORDIC HYDROLOGY												A field study was carried out in three small shallow ice-covered lakes to study heat and mass fluxes and their spatial and temporal variability. During the main part of the winter, the heat flux at the ice-water interface, being of the order 0.5-1, W m(-2), was dominated by conduction from water to ice and did not show any significant variations in time or space. The heat flux from sediments to water was the main source for the lake water heating during early and mid-winter, being depth-dependent and 1-4.5 W m(-2) in early winter, and 0.5-3 W m(-2) in late winter. A heat transport from shallow regions to deep parts was shown to occur during the winter, being of the same order as the vertical fluxes, and should thus be accounted for in any attempt to predict the temperature evolution in an ice covered lake. The salt flux from sediments was found to be of the order 1-10 x 10(-10) kg m(-2) s(-1). A comparison of this flux with salt content changes indicates that the former is of the same order as the horizontal salt flux which is directed from shallow regions to the deeper parts of a lake during winter.

J	REED, JR				REED, JR			ARCTIC ADAPTATIONS IN THE BREEDING BIOLOGY OF SANDHILL CRANES, GRUS-CANADENSIS, ON BANKS ISLAND, NORTHWEST-TERRITORIES	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												The Lesser Sandhill Cranes (Grus canadensis canadensis) nesting on Banks Island, Northwest Territories, possess several behavioral and ecological traits that appear to be adaptations to high Arctic conditions and differ from those of the same subspecies on the mainland. On southern Banks Island cranes inhabit sand dune and dry tundra habitat adjacent to lakes, ponds and rivers. The three breeding pairs of cranes in the 16-km2 study area had a mean territory size of 1.3 km2 compared to 0.6 km2 for the four non-breeding pairs. Nests were located in sand dune regions, apparently to avoid fox predation. Parental care included much under-wing brooding and direct bill-transfers of tubers to the chicks. One one occasion a parent carried a chick on its back while feeding - the first report of such behavior among cranes. Sibling aggression often accompanied parental feeding. Seven methods of foraging were recorded, including lemming Dicrostonyx and Lemmus spp.) hunting in which a crane adopted a special posture enabling it to look down lemming burrows. On seven occasions cranes were observed capturing and consuming lemmings. Because of late spring and early fall migrations, cranes inhabiting the Arctic Islands have a truncated breeding season compared to continental populations.																			0008-3550					OCT-DEC	1988	102	4					643	648																WOS:A1988U021100006

In this study, we evaluated the performance of four supervised classification algorithms, namely Minimum Distance (MD), Mahalanobis Distance (MHD), Maximum Likelihood (ML), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Our investigation spanned four distinct study areas, encompassing two dams located in Eastern Algeria (Beniharoune and Ain Zada) and two wetland zones situated in the Western region (Lake of Dayet Oum Rhalez and Lake of Dhayat Morasli). To facilitate our assessment, we employed the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to calculate standard deviation (SD) and semi-variogram values. The results indicated that the ML classifier consistently yielded favorable outcomes, with SD values of 0.027, 0.036, 0.037, and 0.007, while the MHD classifier proved less suitable for extracting homogeneous entities, yielding SD values of 0.137, 0.162, 0.036, and 0.122, respectively. This trend was also evident in the semi-variogram analysis, where the ML classifier demonstrated strong performance with values of 2.39e-004, 4.89e-007, 4.38e-004, and 1.52e-005, while the MHD classifier displayed contrasting results, with values of 9.46e-004, 5.18e-003, 4.46e-004, and 4.57e-004. Also, using data from the autumn season, the results consistently aligned with those obtained during the spring season, signifying the reliability of our approach across different timeframes. Our findings, in comparison to overall precision values, introduce a valuable approach for the assessment of classification accuracy in the context of homogeneous entities.					; bendib, abdelhalim/AFI-4952-2022	Bendib, Abdelhalim/0000-0002-1270-6436; 													0255-660X	0974-3006				2023 DEC 28	2023										10.1007/s12524-023-01802-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-023-01802-0		DEC 2023											WOS:001131550000001

Horizontal and residual circulations driven by wind stress curl in Tokyo Bay	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												This study investigates the horizontal and residual circulations in Tokyo Bay using field observations, numerical simulations, and theoretical analysis. Numerical simulations show that the observed deepening of isopycnals and associated anticyclonic horizontal circulation in the bay head are mainly driven by negative wind stress curl. The effects of river discharge, surface heat fluxes, and tides are found to be small. Under strong wind events, the wind stress curl over the bay head can be large enough to make the surface Ekman layer strongly nonlinear. Theoretical and numerical analyses show that, under large negative wind stress curl, the nonlinearity tends to induce positive pumping velocity (at the base of the surface mixed layer) that counteracts the Ekman pumping; however, the typical duration of wind events in the bay head is not long enough to induce positive pumping under negative wind stress curl. These results and historical wind data suggest that the average horizontal circulation and residual circulation immediately below the surface mixed layer in Tokyo Bay are, respectively, cyclonic and convergent in summer but anticyclonic and divergent in winter.					; Nakayama, Keisuke/K-1584-2013; Komai, Katsuaki/KUC-8354-2024	Komai, Katsuaki/0000-0002-9981-6821; Nakayama, Keisuke/0000-0003-2420-1045; 													2169-9275	2169-9291				MAR	2014	119	3					1977	1992		10.1002/2013JC009396	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2013JC009396													WOS:000333816100027

LIMNOLOGICAL VARIABLES RELEVANT TO THE PRESENCE OF THE ENDANGERED WHITE-HEADED DUCK IN SOUTHEASTERN SPANISH WETLANDS DURING A DRY PERIOD	ACTA ZOOLOGICA ACADEMIAE SCIENTIARUM HUNGARICAE					5th Conference of Societas-Internationalis-Limnologiae (SIL)	AUG 26-30, 2006	Aqua Birds Working Grp, Eger, HUNGARY	Soc Int Limnol	Aqua Birds Working Grp			We have studied the distribution of the white-headed duck (Oxyura leucocephalu), an endangered diving duck, living in wetlands in Alicante (southeast Spain). Coordinated with these observations, we made a limnological characterization of the water and sediment of several lakes within these wetlands, selecting those both with the presence and absence of the duck. Limnological variables analyzed included those related with the trophic status (water transparency, dissolved nutrients in the water, and chlorophyll a concentration), those related with the water mineralization, depth, macrophyte cover, and potential food items in the sediment (mostly chironomidae larvae and macrophyte seeds). The study was done during a dry period (spring and summer of 2005). In the examined period, a large reservoir (which was the preferred place by white-headed ducks in previous years) dried out in spring. Consequently, the population of white-headed ducks in the area was much lower and the birds distributed themselves among other water bodies in the surrounding wetlands. Using the limnological variables, we performed a Prinicpal Component Analysis (PCA). The first, but especially the third factor, extracted from the analysis showed an ordination of the samples which separated the water bodies where the duck was present. Correlated with these factors, we have found variables regarding morphometry, trophic status, and food availability in the sediments of the lakes. Under these conditions of severe dought, white-headed ducks were distributed preferably in deeper lakes with more chironomid biomass, and also in lakes with a lower macrophyte cover and greater turbidity. Within the range of conditions available, the ducks did not show preferences for salinity and they were found from mesotrophic to hipertrophic waters.

After model calibration, the surface gravity wave dynamics were examined from the aspects of wave climate and seasonality, inter-basin wave interactions, as well as its potential susceptibility to regional climate change. Compared to the Central and Eastern Basins, the Western Basin has relatively gentle wave climate. The Western Basin and the nearshore areas are most susceptible to the wave-induced bottom orbital oscillations on the seasonal mean scale, and the offshore Central Basin is sensitive to them as well during episodic events. Profound seasonality was found in both mean and extreme wave dynamics during ice-free cycles. Mean significant wave height (SWH) is highest during fall with more occurrences of extreme events (SWH > 3.1 m) and is lowest during summer, which is controlled by wind speed and direction collectively. Besides, swells generated in the Central and Eastern Basins could interact with each other under various wind directions, whereas wave generated in the Central Basin could hardly propagate into the Western Basin. In addition, the regression analysis of surrounding meteorological stations indicates increasing SWH in the Western Basin and decreasing SWH in the Eastern Basin.

Juvenile rainbow trout (approximate to 11 g initially) were exposed for 14 months to four treatments: the natural water temperature cycle of the inshore region of Lake Ontario, this cycle +2 degrees C to simulate a global warming scenario, and these temperature cycles in the presence of an additional 70 mu mol total ammonia.L-1 (NH3 range: 0.005-0.013 mg.L-1). The additional +2 degrees C substantially increased appetite over winter, significantly elevating specific growth rates. These gains were lost, however, over summer due to suppression of appetite and growth at high temperature. Ammonia alone tended to elevate growth, but the combination of +2 degrees C and ammonia resulted in a general decrease in the activity of enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, glutamate dehydrogenase, and glutamine synthetase). These results document the dramatic influence of a +2 degrees C warming scenario on the growth and feeding metabolism of juvenile rainbow trout. Moreover, the data indicate that a chronic small temperature increase, together with low-level ammonia pollution, substantially alters protein dynamics, and hence growth, in juvenile freshwater fishes; juvenile rainbow trout without thermal refuge will experience an increase in t a warmer, more polluted environment.

Fine-scale behavioural differences distinguish resource use by ecomorphs in a closed ecosystem	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Temporal differences in habitat use and foraging specialisms between ecomorphs represent aspects of behavioural phenotype that are poorly understood with regard to the origin and maintenance of ecological diversity. We tested the role of behaviour in resource use divergence of two Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) phenotypes, a slim, putatively pelagic-dwelling morph and a robust, putatively littoral-dwelling generalist morph, over an annual cycle, using biotelemetry and stable isotopes. Pelagic morph charr exhibited significantly greater delta C-13 depletion, concordant with increased zooplanktivory, than for the Littoral morph. Although three-dimensional space-use of the morphs strongly overlapped, on average, the Littoral morph used that habitat 19.3% more than the Pelagic morph. Pelagic morph fish were significantly more active, further from the lake bed and at greater depth than Littoral fish (annual means respectively, Pelagic, 0.069BLs(-1), 8.21 m and 14.11 m; Littoral, 0.047BLs(-1), 5.87 m and 10.47 m). Patterns of habitat use differed between ecomorphs at key times, such as during autumn and at ice break, likely related to spawning and resumption of intensive foraging respectively. Extensive space-use overlap, but fine-scale differences in habitat use between charr ecomorphs, suggests the importance of competition for generating and maintaining polymorphism, and its potential for promoting reproductive isolation and evolution in sympatry.					, Guttorm/KCK-8343-2024; Rosten, Carolyn/U-4242-2017	Rosten, Carolyn/0000-0002-1117-444X													2045-2322					APR 21	2016	6								24369	10.1038/srep24369	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep24369								27098197					WOS:000374483500001

However, whether any of these nontraditional archaea perform methanogenesis remains elusive. Here, we report field and microcosm experiments based on C-13-tracer labeling and genome-resolved metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, revealing that nontraditional archaea are predominant active methane producers in two geothermal springs. Archaeoglobales performed methanogenesis from methanol and may exhibit adaptability in using methylotrophic and hydrogenotrophic pathways based on temperature/substrate availability. A five-year field survey found Candidatus Nezhaarchaeota to be the predominant mcr-containing archaea inhabiting the springs; genomic inference and mcr expression under methanogenic conditions strongly suggested that this lineage mediated hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in situ. Methanogenesis was temperature-sensitive , with a preference for methylotrophic over hydrogenotrophic pathways when incubation temperatures increased from 65 & DEG; to 75 & DEG;C. This study demonstrates an anoxic ecosystem wherein methanogenesis is primarily driven by archaea beyond known methanogens, highlighting diverse nontraditional mcr-containing archaea as previously unrecognized methane sources.

Examination of Muskellunge overwinter survival and growth in an earthen extensive culture pond	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE												ObjectiveTrack cohort survival, individual growth, and PIT tag retention, as well as relative growth rate, from fall to the following spring for age-0 Muskellunge Esox masquinongy held in an extensive culture pond.MethodsA total of 806 age-0 Muskellunge were provided a 12-mm PIT tag in October 2021 and placed into a 0.1-ha pond. Individual total length (mm) was recorded for each fish. When the pond was drained in March 2022, an assessment of survival and PIT tag retention was calculated for the cohort, as well as assessment of mean individual growth and relative growth rate.ResultMuskellunge experienced high survival (91.9%) but low individual mean growth (21.7 +/- 0.2 mm [mean +/- SE]). The mean length of surviving Muskellunge (267.8 +/- 0.9 mm) was significantly greater than nonsurviving Muskellunge (251.4 +/- 3.1 mm). However, smaller surviving Muskellunge did exhibit slightly improved growth compared to individuals that were initially longer.ConclusionThe results provide an expectation for overwinter survival and growth in an extensive culture pond. This can assist managers in developing expectations on the numbers and length of Muskellunge that will be available to stock the following spring, which has largely been unreported previously. The results from this study provide fishery culture and management staff with an expected survival and growth related to overwintering age-0 Muskellunge in an outside pond. Knowing that fish will have high survival but minimal growth can help managers determine how many they would like to put in the pond to meet stocking goals as well as anticipate the potential survival of these fish in waters with different predators.Impact statement																			1522-2055	1548-8454				JAN	2024	86	1					55	60		10.1002/naaq.10311	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/naaq.10311		NOV 2023											WOS:001101648600001
J	Liu, G				Liu, Gang			The "Loss" of Purity: Changes and Persistence in the Cultural Memory of the Cold Spring Pavilion	FRONTIERS OF LITERARY STUDIES IN CHINA												Ever since the Cold Spring Pavilion (Lengquan ting) was built, it has been extolled by scholar-literati as a place of purity, where the dust of the mundane world could be cleansed by the cold spring water flowing beside it. For centuries, people tried to reinforce the image of the pavilion as an innocent haven through writing poems, stories, and essays about their visits there. But they were unaware, or refused to admit, that their admiration of the place also possessed the power to destroy whatever sacredness and serenity it stood for. This paper examines representations of the Cold Spring Pavilion in Chinese literature through the lens of a paradox that has haunted the pavilion since it was first built. The paper argues that, ever since the pavilion was built, it has, through its literary-historical representation, been slowly but inevitably absorbed or assimilated into what it had originally been built to fend off. Like the Cold Spring, which flowed into West Lake, the Cold Spring Pavilion, which was created to help people resist the temptations of city life, was inevitably absorbed into the very fabric of the city.																			1673-7318	1673-7423					2014	8	2					205	224		10.3868/s010-003-014-0011-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.3868/s010-003-014-0011-9													WOS:000214944100001
J	Cao, J; Ding, YC; Wang, J; Tao, Y				Cao, Jie; Ding, Yuchao; Wang, Jian; Tao, Yun			The sea surface temperature configuration of Greenland Sea-subpolar region of North Atlantic and the summer rainfall anomaly in low-latitude highlands of China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Based on reanalysis and observational data sets, the present study reveals that the variability of summer rainfall in the low-latitude highlands of China (CLLH) is significantly correlated to the sea surface temperature (SST) configuration from the Greenland Sea (GS) southeastwards to the subpolar region of North Atlantic (NASR). The SST configuration orientated in northwest-southeast direction exerts its impact on the summer rainfall coming into the CLLH via modifying the activity of cold air in the northeast CLLH. When SST is warmer than normal in the GS and colder than normal around the NASR, a teleconnection with an anomalous cyclone over the Europe, an anomalous anticyclone around the Lake Baikal and an anomalous cyclone over the East Asia will be forced out by the dispersion of Rossby wave on the spherical surface of the earth. The teleconnection traversing Europe-East China is favourable to transportation of cold air from the East Siberian southwestwards to the CLLH and thus gives rise to the increase of summer rainfall in the CLLH. When SST is colder than normal in the GS and warmer than normal around the NASR, the similar teleconnection with opposite phase is forced out, causing a less than normal summer rainfall in the CLLH.

SEASONAL AND ANNUAL CYCLES OF CHLOROPHYLL AND PHAEOPIGMENTS, IN RELATION TO EUPHOTIC DEPTH AND THEIR VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION IN SMALL NORTH GERMAN LAKES	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												In 1981, weekly investigations were made into the relationship between chlorophyll levels and the depth of the euphotic zone and extinction coefficients in the Plussee. Chlorophyll and phaeopigment production was studied in relation to the algal growth phases, depth, global radiation and temperature. Chlorophyll specific and the non-algal light attenuation were estimated and compared with data from other lakes. In the euphotic zone the mean annual level of chlorophyll-a was .apprx. 20 mg m-3 or 80 mg m-2, over the ranges 1-60 mg m-3 or 8-220 mg m-2 (1981). Maxima of .apprx. 100 mg m-3 were observed corresponding to earlier findings. Phaeopigment levels increased from .apprx. 15% of chlorophyll-a to .apprx. 200% in metalimnetic layers and during algal decline. The chlorophyll maxima varied over the years of investigation, being highest in 1981. Several algal assemblages with short periods of dominance formed numerous chlorophyll peaks, which together produced 3 major blooms. Chlorophyll maxima could occur at any depth between surface and 10 m. Distinct epilimnetic and metalimnetic chlorophyll maxima were seen in spring and later summer, respectively.																			0003-9136						1985	104	2					219	234																WOS:A1985ANJ9700004
J	Berger, SA; Diehl, S; Stibor, H; Trommer, G; Ruhenstroth, M				Berger, Stella A.; Diehl, Sebastian; Stibor, Herwig; Trommer, Gabriele; Ruhenstroth, Miriam			Water temperature and stratification depth independently shift cardinal events during plankton spring succession	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												In deep temperate lakes, the beginning of the growing season is triggered by thermal stratification, which alleviates light limitation of planktonic producers in the surface layer and prevents heat loss to deeper strata. The sequence of subsequent phenological events (phytoplankton spring bloom, grazer peak, clearwater phase) results in part from coupled phytoplankton-grazer interactions. Disentangling the separate, direct effects of correlated climatic drivers (stratification-dependent underwater light climate vs. water temperature) from their indirect effects mediated through trophic feedbacks is impossible using observational field data, which challenges our understanding of global warming effects on seasonal plankton dynamics. We therefore manipulated water temperature and stratification depth independently in experimental field mesocosms containing ambient microplankton and inocula of the resident grazer Daphnia hyalina. Higher light availability in shallower surface layers accelerated primary production, warming accelerated consumption and growth of Daphnia, and both factors speeded up successional dynamics driven by trophic feedbacks. Specifically, phytoplankton peaked and decreased earlier and Daphnia populations increased and peaked earlier at both shallower stratification and higher temperature. The timing of ciliate dynamics was unrelated to both factors. Volumetric peak densities of phytoplankton, ciliates and Daphnia in the surface layer were also unaffected by temperature but declined with stratification depth in parallel with light availability. The latter relationship vanished, however, when population sizes were integrated over the entire water column. Overall our results suggest that, integrated over the entire water column of a deep lake, surface warming and shallower stratification independently speed up spring successional events, whereas the magnitudes of phytoplankton and zooplankton spring peaks are less sensitive to these factors. Therefore, accelerated dynamics under warming need not lead to a trophic mismatch (given similar grazer inocula at the time of stratification). We emphasize that entire water column dynamics must be studied to estimate global warming effects on lake ecosystems.

J	Brugnano, C; Guglielmo, L; Ianora, A; Zagami, G				Brugnano, Cinzia; Guglielmo, Letterio; Ianora, Adrianna; Zagami, Giacomo			Temperature effects on fecundity, development and survival of the benthopelagic calanoid copepod, Pseudocyclops xiphophorus	MARINE BIOLOGY												The shallow-living, benthopelagic copepod species Pseudocyclops xiphophorus Wells (R Soc Edimburg 67:1967), collected over a yearly cycle from the fouling material in the brackish water Lake Faro (North-eastern Sicily), showed marked seasonal fluctuations in population abundances, with maximum numbers recorded in autumn. Highest in situ egg production rates coincided with periods of low adult and juvenile densities and vice versa, except in autumn when peaks in egg production and adult population densities were coincident. In this period, mean daily egg production rates reached a maximum of 4-5 eggs per female, when surface water temperature was 17-18A degrees C. Egg production rates declined drastically in winter and were completely arrested when surface temperatures dropped to 10-12A degrees C. In March, daily egg production rates began to increase again with an increase in ambient temperatures, reaching a maximum at the end of August. In the laboratory, as in the field, mean daily egg production rates were positively correlated with temperature, with values ranging from 2.2 +/- A 0.3 (16A degrees C) to 8.9 +/- A 2.6 (30A degrees C) (mean +/- A S.D.) eggs per female per day. At 32A degrees C, P. xiphophorus females survived but did not reproduce. At 34A degrees C, all specimens died after a few days. In terms of total egg production for the entire female lifespan, maximum values occurred at 16A degrees C and minimum at 24A degrees C. Temperature also dramatically affected female life span, which was shorter at higher temperatures. Development time of eggs decreased with increasing temperature, as also development time from egg to adulthood. Remating was necessary for the continued production of fertile eggs at 16A degrees C because female life span was longer. The unique egg-laying behaviour in this species may ensure higher survival rates of egg stages compared to free-spawning and egg-carrying calanoid species. After releasing the egg pair, the female swims over the eggs with a rotatory motion, secreting a substance which facilitates the adhesion of the eggs to the bottom; she then continues to swim over the eggs until they are attached. Although egg production rates in this species are low compared to other pelagic copepods, they are within the range of values reported for egg-carrying species. The greater fecundity at higher temperatures compared to other subtemperate species indicates that the species is well adapted to the higher temperatures of coastal lagoons and brackish water lakes where it contributes to the biofouling community.

Regional analysis of the effect of paved roads on sodium and chloride in lakes	WATER RESEARCH												Salinization of surface water from sodium chloride (road salt) applied to paved roads is a widely recognized environmental concern in the northern hemisphere, yet practical information to improve winter road management to reduce the environmental impacts of this deicer is lacking. The purpose of our study was to provide such information by developing baseline concentrations for sodium and chloride for lakes in watersheds without paved roads, and then determining the relationship between these ions and density, type, and proximity of paved roads to shoreline. We used average summer (June September) sodium and chloride data for 138 lakes combined in a watershed based analysis of paved road networks in the Adirondack Park of New York, U.S.A. The watersheds used in our study represented a broad range in paved road density and type, 56 of which had no paved roads. Median lake sodium and chloride concentrations in these 56 watersheds averaged 0.55 and 0.24 mg/L, respectively. In contrast, the median sodium and chloride concentrations for the 82 lakes in watersheds with paved roads were 3.60 and 7.22 mg/L, respectively. Paved road density (lane-km/km(2)) was positively correlated with sodium and chloride concentrations, but only state roads were significantly correlated with sodium and chloride while local roads were not. State road density alone explained 84 percent of the variation in both ions. We also successfully modeled the relationship between road proximity to shoreline and sodium and chloride concentrations in lakes, which allowed us to identify sections of road that contributed more to explaining the variation in sodium and chloride in lakes. This model and our approach could be used as part of larger efforts to identify environmentally sensitive areas where alternative winter road management treatments should be applied.

J	Babikov, BV				Babikov, B., V			The Hydrological Role of Wetlands and Water Supply of Rivers	LESNOY ZHURNAL-FORESTRY JOURNAL												The influence of wetlands on the water supply of rivers has been discussed in media and some academic papers for more than 100 years. The first papers were published after draining the Polesye wetlands in Belarus in 1880's. Formation and hydrological role of wetlands in biosphere are considered. The influence of wetlands on the water supply of rivers is shown on the basis of multi-year stationary research. The reasons for reducing of water discharge in rivers with overgrowing of lakes and formation of wetlands on their place are described. The features of value of water flow from drained swamps in rivers obtained in 15-years stationary water-balance research were calculated according to the runoff rates. Water permeability of wetlands along the peat deposit depth were studied. The reasons for change in filtration of groundwater after hydromelioration of wetlands were established. The influence of steam flows inside the swamps on water discharge and entry of water into rivers were studied. There is a break in water flow from wetlands to rivers, especially in summer period. The reasons for "drainless periods" duration and the concept of "zero flow" (when groundwater flows into channels, but does not enter rivers) were explained. The influence of hydromelioration on the growth of pine forest stands, the improvement of their bonitet class in swamps were studied. The dependence of water discharge on bonitet class of forest stands was shown. It was established that water discharge from drained swamps during the year is more leveled off by reducing the spring flood flow and increasing the flow in summer period, which ensures the uniformity of river water supply.																			0536-1036						2018		5					38	47		10.17238/issn0536-1036.2018.5.38	http://dx.doi.org/10.17238/issn0536-1036.2018.5.38													WOS:000452573700004
J	Hu, Y; Yan, X; Shen, Y; Di, MX; Wang, J				Hu, Ying; Yan, Xue; Shen, Yun; Di, Mingxiao; Wang, Jun			Occurrence, behavior and risk assessment of estrogens in surface water and sediments from Hanjiang River, Central China	ECOTOXICOLOGY												Estrogens have been widely detected in water and might pose a potential threat to the aquatic ecosystem. However, little information is available about the occurrence, multi-phase fate and potential risks of estrogens in Hanjiang River (HR). In this work, the concentration, multi-phase distribution and risk assessment of eight estrogens were studied by investigating surface water and sediment samples from HR during two seasons. These samples were analyzed using the solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The concentrations of eight estrogens were 4.5-111ng/l in surface water and 1.7-113ng/g dry weight in sediments. 4-nonylphenol (NP) was the predominant estrogen in both water and sediments. The estrogens showed significantly spatial variability, with the highest average concentration in the lower section of HR (p<0.01, F>12.21). Meanwhile, NP, 17-estradiol (E2), Bisphenol A (BPA) and 4-tert-octyphenol (OP) in surface water exhibited higher concentrations in summer than in winter (p<0.05, F>4.62). The sediment-water partition coefficients of estrogens suggested that these compounds partitioned more to particulate phase. Risk assessment indicated that estriol (E3) was the main contributor to the total estradiol equivalent concentration. Moreover, estrogen mixtures could pose high ecological risks to aquatic organisms in surface water. Overall, estrogens are ubiquitous in HR, and their potential ecological risks should not be neglected.

Is sexual size dimorphism in walleye, Sander vitreus, a driver of seasonal movements in Lake Erie?	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Walleye (Sander vitreus) are a sexually dimorphic species in which females are larger than males in adulthood. Walleye can also exhibit sex- and population-based differences in migration behavior. In Lake Erie, we used acoustic telemetry to test the prediction that female walleye exhibit larger broad-scale movements than males during the summer and autumn. This prediction was based on the hypothesis that greater foraging in females would be needed to satisfy their higher energy requirements. We quantified movements of males and females from distinct spawning populations from Lake Erie's west and east basins using a lake-wide grid of acoustic receivers in 2017 and 2018. We found no differences between male and female home range sizes, core range sizes, or distances travelled in either population. Fish length-at-tagging was unrelated to the size of a fish's home range or to its distance travelled, contrary to previous predictions about body size as a driver of migration distance in the Lake Erie population. We found that west basin walleye occupied large and indiscrete portions of the lake, but the core range of females extended into the central basin, whereas males were concentrated in the west basin. Walleye originating from the east basin confined their movements primarily to the east basin and showed stronger home range overlap among members of their population than did walleye from the west basin population. Within either population, walleye had more home range overlap with members of the same sex, which likely reflects differences in the migratory tendencies of males and females.					; Vandergoot, Christopher/JAO-1190-2023	Kraus, Richard/0000-0003-4494-1841; Bihun, Christian/0000-0002-3992-6236														1095-8649				FEB	2025	106	2					430	441		10.1111/jfb.15960	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.15960		OCT 2024						39425512					WOS:001338111200001

We provide a summary of the chironomid-, cladoceran- and diatom-based transfer functions available from the Swiss Alps and discuss the potential problem of co-variation between summer temperature and lake nutrient conditions for transfer-function development. Whereas the diatom-based summer temperature transfer function remains to be evaluated in down-core reconstructions, the cladoceran- and chironomid-based transfer functions have been used successfully to produce summer temperature records on Lateglacial and Holocene time scales that are in good agreement with other temperature reconstructions in the Alps. Major problems that can be encountered when using fossil assemblages of aquatic organisms for temperature reconstruction in the Alpine region are biases in the inferred temperatures associated with human impact on lakes and parameters other than temperature affecting the fossil assemblages. A multi-proxy approach to palaeoenvironmental reconstruction is recommended to keep a close control on past catchment and within-lake processes during the time interval of interest.

Study focus: Employing SWAT +, WEAP, and IAHRIS, we assess environmental flow impacts on the Zarineh River Basin through two key aspects. Firstly, we evaluate the dam -induced alteration of the hydrological regime. Secondly, we explore future implications by prioritizing water allocation for environmental flows. Our approach involves developing, calibrating, and validating a SWAT + hydrological model, analyzing hydrological alteration indicators using IAHRIS, and calculating environmental flows using the basic flow method in the SWAT + post -processing tool. Using the WEAP water allocation model, three scenarios are assessed: 1) status quo, prioritizing drinking water and industry over agriculture; 2) environmental flows, prioritizing regulation compliance; 3) improved irrigation efficiency, facilitating a 10% increase while maintaining environmental flow prioritization. New hydrological insights for the region: The study reveals the altered flow regime 's failure to capture seasonal variations during dry years, particularly in winter and spring. Environmental and agricultural water demands compete, posing challenges to water management in the basin. Prioritizing environmental requirements increases reliability by 56% for environmental flows but decreases it by 11% for agriculture. Balancing environmental flows and agricultural water demands is crucial. A third scenario considers increased irrigation efficiency, requiring both decreased water allocation and enhanced efficiency. This research offers policymakers insights into formulating balanced environmental flow strategies, considering water demand reliability and basin hydrology.					Mousavi, S.

Identifying potential habitats in annual cycle stages and their influencing factors is indispensable for conservation along the flyway. In this study, we obtained satellite tracking of eight swan geese (Anser cygnoides) wintering at Poyang Lake (28 degrees 57 ' 4.2 '', 116 degrees 21 ' 53.36 '') from 2019 to 2020. Using the Maximum Entropy species distribution model, we investigated the potential habitats distribution of the swan geese during their migration cycle. We analyzed the relative contribution of various environmental factors to habitat suitability and conservation status for each potential habitat along the flyway. Our results show that the primary wintering grounds of swan geese are located in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Stopover sites were widely distributed, mainly in the Bohai Rim, the middle reaches of the Yellow River, and the Northeast Plain, and extended westward to Inner Mongolia and Mongolia. Breeding grounds are mainly in Inner Mongolia and eastern Mongolia, while some are scattered in Mongolia's central and western. The contribution rates of major environmental factors are different in breeding grounds, stopover sites, and wintering grounds. Breeding grounds were influenced by slope, elevation, and temperature. Slope, human footprint index, and temperature were the main factors that affected stopover sites. Wintering grounds were determined by land use, elevation, and precipitation. The conservation status of habitats is 9.6% for breeding grounds, 9.2% for wintering grounds, and 5.3% for stopover sites. Our findings thus provide a critically international assessment of potential habitats protection for geese species on the East Asian Flyway.

In this study, reproduction and plant growth of V. spinulosa were tested at three light intensities (high, moderate and low, i.e. 50%, 15% and 7% of full sunlight, respectively) for 1 year. Asexual reproduction by forming winter tubers in the sediment was found to be of greater significance for population maintenance than sexual reproduction. Plant biomass and ramet number remained unchanged between October and June in the following year at both 15% and 7% of full sunlight, suggesting that the light requirement for population maintenance is low. At high light, plant biomass, ramet number and tuber biomass were higher and plants tended to form a larger number of small-sized than large-sized tubers. Small-sized tubers featured a high nitrogen content and germinated early, while large-sized tubers were characterised by a high carbon content and germinated later in spring. Thus, there probably is a trade-off between the germination schedule and carbon and nitrogen contents, depending on tuber size. Large numbers, high nitrogen content and early germination of small tubers at high light supported fast establishment of V. spinulosa populations in spring. Our study highlights the importance of asexual reproduction as contributing to a high competition and expansion capacity for V. spinulosa populations, making it a valuable species to focus on for lake management and restoration.

J	Zhang, M; Yang, Z; Shi, XL; Yu, Y				Zhang, Min; Yang, Zhen; Shi, Xiaoli; Yu, Yang			The synergistic effect of rising temperature and declining light boosts the dominance of bloom-forming cyanobacteria in spring	HARMFUL ALGAE												Global warming and eutrophication result in rising temperature and declining underwater light, respectively, which affect the shift of the phytoplankton community in spring. However, knowledge of how temperature and light synergistically impact phytoplankton community shifts and cyanobacterial dominance is limited. In this study, we performed a long-term data analysis and an outdoor mesocosm experiment to detect the synergistic effect of temperature and light on shift of phytoplankton community and dominance of bloom-forming cyano-bacteria in Lake Taihu, China. The results showed that cyanobacterial biomass was boosted alone and jointly by increased temperature and decreased light levels (sunshine hours and light intensity), and the interaction might be more important than temperature or light levels independently. Chlorophyta biomass was driven by the joint effect of temperature and light levels. Bacillariophyta biomass was mainly affected by light levels, and decreased with declining light levels. Our results emphasize that the interactions of temperature and light have an important impact on the shift of the phytoplankton community in spring. Increasing temperature and declining underwater light boosted the flourishing of cyanobacteria, especially Microcystis, and were adverse to the development of diatoms in spring. Our findings contribute to an increased understanding of the effects of temperature and light on phytoplankton composition shifts and the development of cyanobacterial dominance in spring.						, Min/0000-0002-8130-5214													1568-9883	1878-1470				JUL	2022	116								102252	10.1016/j.hal.2022.102252	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2022.102252		MAY 2022						35710204					WOS:000805230500001

In particular, the use of amphipod prey by lesser scaup has declined in many regions of the upper Midwest U.S.A. and has been linked to expanded fisheries, although empirical data on diet overlap are lacking. To explore patterns of prey use by lesser scaup and diet overlap with fishes, we quantified diets of scaup and fishes during the 2003 and 2004 spring migration in eastern South Dakota, U.S.A. We compared diet overlap between lesser scaup and fishes collected from Twin Lakes, South Dakota-an important stopover location for spring-migrating scaup. Plant seeds occurred in > 95% of lesser scaup diets (n = 118) and represented an appreciable amount of consumed biomass (> 70%). Gastropods, amphipods, and chironomids were the most abundant invertebrate prey taxa and occurred in 29-34% of lesser scaup diets. Although relatively frequent, these taxa each contributed only 4-27% of the diet by weight. Percent dry mass of amphipods, a preferred prey by lesser scaup, was low (4%) indicating that amphipod availability may be reduced during spring migration. Analysis of fish diets showed that black bullhead Ameiurus melas and yellow perch Perca flavescens had the highest diet overlap with lesser scaup at 94% and 92%, respectively. Moreover, mean size of amphipods and chironomids found in fish diets were significantly larger than that consumed by lesser scaup. Our findings support the notion that amphipod use by spring-migrating lesser scaup has declined and that size-selective predation by fishes may influence prey availability for lesser scaup.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2008	598						389	398		10.1007/s10750-007-9178-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-9178-y													WOS:000251874300030

The traditional sampling and gas transfer models used to estimate lake CO2 fluxes are variable and uncertain, and ice-covered periods are often excluded from the annual carbon budget. Here, the first longtime (2013-2017) direct measurement of CO2 flux by eddy covariance system over the largest saline lake (Qinghai lake) in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) revealed that ice-covered period draws large amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere (-0.87 +/- 0.38 g C m(-2) d(-1)), a value more than twice the CO2 flux rate during the ice-free period (-0.41 +/- 0.35 g C m(-2) d(-1)). The total CO2 uptake by all saline lakes on the QTP was estimated to -10.28 +/- 1.65 Tg C yr(-1), an equivalent to approximately one third of the net terrestrial ecosystems carbon sink in QTP. Our results indicate large sink for CO2 in winter is controlled by both seasonal hydrochemistry processes and lake ice absorption in saline lakes. This research also demonstrates decreasing CO2 uptake from the atmosphere by saline lakes on the QTP, which may turn carbon sinks to carbon sources with future warming.

The dominant plants at the study site formed three sub-zones (Phragmites zone, Juncus zone and Miscanthus zone) across a topographic gradient on the shoreline. In the Phragmites and Juncus zones, we observed a positive correlation between hourly changes in CO2 and CH4 fluxes and changes in the water table. In particular, the magnitude and pattern of daily variation in CO2 and CH4 fluxes were different on days during spring tide and neap tide in the Phragmites and Juncus zones. Variations in CO2 and CH4 fluxes in the Phragmites and Juncus zones over the course of a day during spring tide were correlated with water-table level. We found that the rate of change of the water table, as distinguished from just differences in the water table, was a major environmental factor controlling the CO2 and CH4 fluxes. In the Miscanthus zone during spring tide, soil temperature was the main factor affecting daily variation in CO2 and CH4 fluxes.

New taxa of Tateidae (Caenogastropoda, Truncatelloidea) from springs associated with the Great Artesian Basin and Einasleigh Uplands, Queensland, with the description of two related taxa from eastern coastal drainages	ZOOTAXA												Species from artesian springs associated with the Queensland Great Artesian Basin that were previously included in the tateid genus Jardinella are included in three new genera, namely Eulodrobia, with six species, five of them new and all from the Eulo Supergroup; Springvalia, with one species from the Springvale Supergroup; and Carnarvoncochlea with two previously-described species, from the Carnarvon Supergroup. The genus Edgbastonia is extended to include eight previously described species, in addition to the type species, and four new species-group taxa from the Barcaldine Supergroup springs; all but the type species are included in the new subgenus Barcaldinia. Three new species from non-artesian springs in north Queensland are included in Edgbastonia, one of them tentatively. Two additional related new genera, both with a single new species, are described from outside the Great Artesian Basin; Conondalia from southeast Queensland and Nundalia from north-eastern New South Wales. The genus Jardinella, previously used for all the Queensland spring tateids, is here restricted to three species found in coastal rivers and streams in northeast Queensland. A molecular phylogenetic analysis using COI and 16S mitochondrial genes in combination suggests that the Queensland Great Artesian Basin taxa may be more closely related to the tateid genera Austropyrgus, Pseudotricula, Posticobia and Potamopyrgus than to the South Australian GAB taxa, thus indicating the separate origins of these two desert spring faunas.

Various abiotic and biotic factors determine epiphyte density, among them nutrients, water clarity and possibly allelopathy. We compared epiphyte biomass on the major occurring macrophytes, among them allelopathically active species in four shallow eutrophic lakes in Upper Swabia (Southern Germany). We determined epiphyte chlorophyll a, organic carbon, nitrogen and ash-free dry mass. Mean epiphyte chlorophyll a per macrophyte ranged between 100 and 400 mug g(-1) dm in summer and increased up to 1700 mug g(-1) dm in autumn. Few differences between species and lakes were observed. No apparent relation was found between epiphyte density and physical or chemical variables of the lakes. Epiphytes had a molar stoichiometry of organic carbon to nitrogen (C:N) slightly below 7: 1, a ratio considered to be optimal also for benthic algae. Lakes with higher concentrations of humic compounds exhibited a significant higher ratio of organic carbon to epiphytic chlorophyll a, indicating a higher proportion of heterotrophs in the epiphyte layer. In one lake, one phenotype of Elodea nuttallii exhibited a significant higher C:chl a ratio than other macrophytes. Allelopathy as a factor responsible for this difference is discussed.

The improvement of measures to protect the species in Western European wintering grounds and the climate warming in the Arctic caused an increase in the numbers of the species and a southward expansion of the range from the Arctic islands to the mainland coastal tundras over the last decades of the 20th century. Isolated breeding centers of the Barnacle goose were formed in places of migration stopovers on the coasts of the Baltic Sea and in wintering areas on the coasts of the North Sea. Since the last decade of the last century, the species has begun to settle in the boreal zone of Russia's Northwest. Based on the authors' original data and an analysis of pertinent literature, the process of Barnacle goose dispersal in the Leningrad Region, the Republic of Karelia and the Murmansk Region, the change in its status from a rare visitor to a mass migrant and common, but locally spread breeding species are examined in detail. The main features of the species' phenology, landscape and habitat distribution, and breeding biology are considered. The exponential growth of the abundance of the species occurring synchronously both in the Subarctic and in new nesting sites in the boreal and temperate climatic zones of Europe suggests that an active microevolutionary process takes place against the background of the impact of climate change and an improved protection of the species, thus makes it possible to consider the White-cheeked barrack as an interesting model species for various populational studies.

It is essential to investigate the diversity of the microbial communities in water sources and explore the relationship between microorganisms, algae, and environmental factors. In this study, high-throughput sequencing technology was used to investigate the seasonal variation and diversity of the microbial community in a Shanghai water source. Moreover, this study analyzed the influence of water quality in combination with environmental factors on the microbial community. The results showed that the changing trend among algae was mainly Cyanobacteria in summer and Bacillariophyta in winter. The abundance of Cyanobacteria and Actinobacteria showed an opposite trend, while the abundance of Actinomyces and Ilumatobacter maintained the same trend, which was opposite to that of Bacillariophyta. The relative abundance of beta-Proteobacteria was the highest in July, with higher nutrient concentrations leading to the higher relative abundance of beta-Proteobacteria. Some algae-lysing bacteria play a key role in the decay and degradation of algae. The redundancy analysis showed that permanganate index, ammonia nitrogen, and nitric nitrogen were the main factors affecting the microbial community in the water source. As such, this study may help optimize the microbial control, provide data for the assessment of the environmental and ecological quality of the water, improve water safety and eutrophication pre-control, and further our knowledge regarding the water production process in this water source.

This geothermal spring is slightly acidic (pH 5.0-7.0) in nature, with temperatures varying from 45 to 90 degrees C and continually fed by plant litter, resulting in a relatively high degree of total organic content (TOC). Pooled water sample was analyzed at 16S rRNA V3-V4 hypervariable region by amplicon metagenome sequencing on Illumina HiSeq platform. A total of 2,976,534 paired ends reads were generated which were assigned into 5434 numbers of OTUs. All the resulting 16S rRNA fragments were then classified into 58 bacterial phyla and 2 archaeal phyla. Proteobacteria (88.06%) was found to be the highest represented phyla followed by Thermi (6.43%), Firmicutes (3.41%) and Aquificae (1.10%), respectively. Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota were the only 2 archaeal phyla detected in this study with low abundance. Metagenomic sequences were deposited to SRA database which is available at NCBI with accession number SRX1809286. Functional categorization of the assigned OTUs was performed using PICRUSt tool. In COG analysis "Amino acid transport and metabolism" (8.5%) was found to be the highest represented category whereas among predicted KEGG pathways "Metabolism" (50.6%) was the most abundant. This is the first report of a high resolution microbial phylogenetic profile of an Amazonian hot spring. (C) 2016 The Authors.

This due to a lack of data and insufficient understanding of the multiple contributing factors. This study characterized the spatiotemporal variability in N2 O concentrations and N2 O diffusive fluxes and the contributing factors in Lake Wuliangsuhai, a typical shallow eutrophic and seasonally frozen lake in Inner Mongolia with cold and arid climate. Dissolved N2 O concentrations of the lake exhibited a range of 4.5 to 101.2 nmol/L, displaying significant spatiotemporal variations. The lowest and highest concentrations were measured in summer and winter, respectively. The spatial distribution of N2 O flux was consistent with that of N2 O concentrations. Additionally, the hotspots of N2 O emissions were detected within close to the main inflow of lake. The wide spatial and temporal variation in N2 O emissions indicate the complexity and its relative importance of factors influencing emissions. N2 O emissions in different lake zones and seasons were regulated by diverse factors. Factors influencing the spatial and temporal distribution of N2 O concentrations and fluxes were identified as WT, WD, DO, Chl-a, SD and COD.

Water column gradients beneath the summer ice of a High Arctic freshwater lake as indicators of sensitivity to climate change	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Ice cover persists throughout summer over many lakes at extreme polar latitudes but is likely to become increasingly rare with ongoing climate change. Here we addressed the question of how summer ice-cover affects the underlying water column of Ward Hunt Lake, a freshwater lake in the Canadian High Arctic, with attention to its vertical gradients in limnological properties that would be disrupted by ice loss. Profiling in the deepest part of the lake under thick mid-summer ice revealed a high degree of vertical structure, with gradients in temperature, conductivity and dissolved gases. Dissolved oxygen, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide and methane rose with depth to concentrations well above air-equilibrium, with oxygen values at>150% saturation in a mid-water column layer of potential convective mixing. Fatty acid signatures of the seston also varied with depth. Benthic microbial mats were the dominant phototrophs, growing under a dim green light regime controlled by the ice cover, water itself and weakly colored dissolved organic matter that was mostly autochthonous in origin. In this and other polar lakes, future loss of mid-summer ice will completely change many water column properties and benthic light conditions, resulting in a markedly different ecosystem regime.					; Uchida, Masaki/E-5416-2016; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019; , Wauthy/AAE-7773-2019	Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; Rautio, Milla/0000-0002-2375-9082; Wauthy, Maxime/0000-0002-7768-7133; 													2045-2322					FEB 3	2021	11	1							2868	10.1038/s41598-021-82234-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-82234-z								33536480					WOS:000616965000001
J	Lazar, M; Siebert, C				Lazar, Michael; Siebert, Christian			Out of sight, out of mind. Submarine springs in the Dead Sea-An underappreciated phenomenon	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The drastic drop in Dead Sea lake levels during the last few decades has caused the formation of over 6000 dangerous sinkholes along its coasts. Concurrently, retreating shorelines have led to the exposure of an underexplored phenomenon - submarine spring systems. Once exposed on land, these features are labeled as the more familiar geological hazard - i.e. sinkholes, with no distinction between the two. While visually they may seem similar, the underlying formation mechanism is different, as may well be their hazard potential. This study utilizes high-resolution seismic reflection data collected in 1984 when lake levels were some 35 m higher, together with multibeam bathymetric data from 2014, visual observations and water chemistry data from a verified spring system in order to assess the underlying formation mechanisms of these features, their stability and morphology. Results show that the springs are relatively stable and long-lived systems. They "deserve" to be separated from the sinkholes and studied as a distinct phenomenon. The springs discharge into the lake a significant amount of freshwater from the adjacent aquifers and are therefore, a largely underestimated part of its hydrological budget and the connected fresh groundwater resources. The acceptance of submarine springs as a distinct geological phenomenon and their consideration as a major groundwater outlet into the lake will lead to more realistic groundwater resource models of the Judea and Samaria Eastern Mountain aquifer than exist today. This is extremely important given the increase aridification of the area and the increased demand for freshwater resources.

Penaeid and carid community changes in the St Lucia estuarine lake system, South Africa, under low water level, extended closed periods and marine reconnection conditions	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Penaeid and carid communities were assessed in St Lucia over a wide range of saline conditions, water level conditions and mouth states, including a six-month marine connection and various connections to the Mfolozi Estuary. Samples were collected biannually in spring and autumn from November 2004 to May 2012 using seine nets. Seven penaeid and seven carid species were recorded, of which Palaemon pacificus, P. peringueyi, Penaeus indicus and Metapenaeus monoceros were the most abundant. The decline from 2004 to 2007 in both species recorded and densities of freshwater, estuarine and marine species during the initial closed period was linked to increased salinity, lack of recruitment and reduced estuarine surface area. Increased wave action and high seas following Cyclone Gamede opened the mouth in March 2007 after a 57-month closed period, resulting in recruitment of marine species, predominantly P. indicus, followed by a decline in densities after reclosure in August 2007. Increases in marine and freshwater species were evident after Mfolozi flood connections during 2008, 2009 and 2010. Highest densities were recorded after breaching in 2007 and after flood connections, highlighting the importance of a marine link to maintain the recruitment of penaeid species.																			1608-5914	1727-9364					2016	41	3					251	266		10.2989/16085914.2016.1198886	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2016.1198886													WOS:000383374500001

Our study aimed to investigate the taxonomic composition and abundance of chironomids and to evaluate the relationship of these parameters with the water temperature along the thermal gradient in the arctic Pymvashor Creek thermal system. The greatest taxonomic richness and abundance of chironomids were found in tepid waters (25 chironomid taxa), where Orthocladiinae dominated chironomid communities. Eurybiotic Chironomus Meigen, 1803 species dominated thermal springs. Cold stenotherm Pseudodiamesa (Pseudodiamesa) nivosa (Goetghebuer, 1928) and Eukiefferiella claripennis (Lundbeck, 1898) prevailed in cold karst springs. The chironomid faunas of thermal, tepid, and cold parts of the Pymvashor Creek hydrothermal water system differ statistically significantly.

In general, we observed the highest concentrations for halogenated OPEs, particularly TCEP, TCIPP and TDCIPP, and also non-halogenated TPHP. Differences between regions strongly depended on the matrix. The concentrations of OPEs in dust were significantly higher in the US than in Canada (CAN) and Czech Republic (CZ). CZ had the highest concentrations in window film and CAN in air. SOPE concentrations were 2-3 and 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than SBFRs in air, and dust and window films, respectively. We found a significant relationship between the concentrations in dust and air, and between the concentrations in window film and air for OPEs with log K-OA values< 12, suggesting that equilibrium was reached for these compounds but not for those with log K-OA >12. This hypothesis was confirmed by a large discrepancy between values predicted using a partitioning model and the measured values for OPEs with log K-OA values>12.					; Melymuk, Lisa/AAF-2526-2021; Diamond, Miriam/D-1770-2013; Melymuk, Lisa/H-1061-2017; Klanova, Jana/H-1207-2012	Prokes, Roman/0000-0002-0573-843X; Venier, Marta/0000-0002-2089-8992; Saini, Amandeep/0000-0003-0880-1147; Becanova, Jitka/0000-0002-3091-1054; Melymuk, Lisa/0000-0001-6042-7688; Klanova, Jana/0000-0002-8818-5307; Vojta, Simon/0000-0003-4528-8346													0160-4120	1873-6750				SEP	2017	106						97	104		10.1016/j.envint.2017.05.020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2017.05.020								28624751					WOS:000406175300011

In the present review, altogether 14 ecosystem services provided by silica-scaled chrysophytes were identified highlighting their importance and roles in aquatic ecosystems. The most important supporting services are related to primary production, nutrient- and biogeochemical cycling, as well as sediment formation. Additionally, they are involved in the regulation of climate, maintenance of air quality, biological control and water purification processes (as regulating services). The most relevant provisioning services include their usefulness in environmental monitoring (paleolimnology, ecological status assessment and climate modelling), production of biochemicals and provision of genetic resources. Cultural services are associated with aesthetic values, inspiration source and knowledge system as well. Although silica-scaled chrysophytes are one of the least studied groups of algae, here they are shown to provide important benefits and to have many further powerful opportunities for humans, thus their detailed research in the future is emphasised as an important key for human well-being.

Populations in Temperate China	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Seagrasses are important components of global coastal ecosystems, and the eelgrass Zostera marina L. is widely distributed along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts in the temperate northern hemisphere, but limited datum related to the contribution of sexual reproduction to population recruitment have been reported. This study aimed to understand eelgrass sexual reproduction and population recruitment in Swan Lake (SLL), and Huiquan Bay (HQB) was included for comparison. Random sampling, permanent quadrats or cores and laboratory seed germination-based experimental methods were employed. The flowering, seed production, seed banks, seed germination, seedling survival, and seedling growth of eelgrass were investigated from July 2014 to December 2015 to evaluate the contribution of sexual reproduction to population recruitment. Results indicated a dominant role of asexual reproduction in HQB, while sexual reproduction played a relatively important role in SLL. The highest flowering shoot density in SLL was 517.27 +/- 504.29 shoots m(-2) (June) and represented 53.34% of the total shoots at the center site. The potential seed output per reproductive shoot and per unit area in SLL were 103.67 +/- 37.95 seeds shoot(-1) and 53,623.66 +/- 19,628.11 seeds m(-2), respectively. The maximum seed bank density in SLL was 552.21 +/- 204.94 seeds m(-2) (October). Seed germination mainly occurred from the middle of March to the end of May, and the highest seedling density was 296.88 +/- 274.27 seedlings m(-2) in April. The recruitment from seedlings accounted for 41.36% of the Z. marina population recruitment at the center site, while the sexual recruitment contribution at the patch site (50.52%) was greater than that at the center site. Seeds in SLL were acclimated to spring germination, while in HQB, they were acclimated to autumn germination (early October-late November). Seed bank density in HQB was very low, with a value of 254.35 +/- 613.34 seeds m(-2) (early October). However, seeds in HQB were significantly larger and heavier than those in SLL (size: P = 0.004; weight: P < 0.001). The recruitment from seedlings accounted for as low as 2.53% of the Z. marina population recruitment in HQB. Our laboratory seed germination experiment, which was conducted in autumn, showed that the seed germination percent in HQB was significantly greater than in SLL at optimal germination temperatures (10 and 15. C; P < 0.001). A laboratory seed germination test at suitable temperature may be a potential novel approach to identify the ecological differences among different geographic populations. It is suggested that the Z. marina population recruitment may have different strategies and adapt to specific local conditions, such as in SLL and HQB, and the temperature regime may control morphological and phonological variations.

Climate From the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, 1986-2017: Surface Air Temperature Trends and Redefined Summer Season	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The weather of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, the largest ice-free region of the Antarctica, has been continuously monitored since 1985 with currently 14 operational meteorological stations distributed throughout the valleys. Because climate is based on a 30-year record of weather, this is the first study to truly define the contemporary climate of the McMurdo Dry Valleys. Mean air temperature and solar radiation based on all stations were -20 degrees C and 102 W m(-2), respectively. Depending on the site location, the mean annual air temperatures on the valleys floors ranged between -15 degrees C and -30 degrees C, and mean annual solar radiation varied between 72 and 122 W m(-2). Surface air temperature decreased by 0.7 degrees C per decade from 1986 to 2006 at Lake Hoare station (longest continuous record), after which the record is highly variable with no trend. All stations with sufficiently long records showed similar trend shifts in 2005 +/- 1 year. Summer is defined as November through February, using a physically based process: up-valley warming from the coast associated with a change in atmospheric stability.					; Doran, Peter/ABS-7911-2022	Myers, Madeline/0000-0002-2431-5520; McKay, Christopher/0000-0002-6243-1362; Obryk, Maciej/0000-0002-8182-8656; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				JUL 16	2020	125	13							e2019JD032180	10.1029/2019JD032180	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JD032180													WOS:000551484700033
J	Eser, P; Rosen, MR				Eser, P; Rosen, MR			The influence of groundwater hydrology and stratigraphy on the hydrochemistry of Stump Bay, South Taupo Wetland, New Zealand	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The Stump Bay wetland forms part of the South Taupo wetland, which is situated on the southern shore of Lake Taupo and belongs to the largest continuous wetlands in the North Island of New Zealand. The wetland's extent has increased since the beginning of Lake Taupo's artificial lake level regulation in 1941. Hydrological and hydrochemical data collected seasonally from nine piezometers installed in the Stump Bay wetland over a duration of two years show the influence of the stratigraphy and groundwater flow on the hydrochemistry of the wetland. The hydrology is characterised by through-flowing or discharging groundwater, with a main flow direction towards the lake. The piezometric contour map shows a groundwater divide running from south-west to north-east, creating an eastern and western discharge system. Higher dissolved oxygen concentrations (0.3-6.1 g/m(3)) and slightly higher temperatures (8-18.9 degrees C) in the western part of Stump Bay suggest the presence of Tongariro River seepage water in this area. The eastern part of the wetland is likely to be fed by discharging water originating from the Turangi plain. The main chemical characteristic of Stump Bay's groundwater is the high concentration of total dissolved iron (up to 145 g/m(3)). High iron concentrations are found to be associated with the presence of a clay layer within the top metre of peat/sediment. The reduction of iron controls the groundwater's conductivity (0.07-0.6 mS/cm), alkalinity (18-423 g/m(3)), and pH (6-7.2). The nutrient status of the wetland's groundwater is generally low. Increased microbial activity at higher temperatures during summer is likely to cause seasonal fluctuations in pH, alkalinity, concentrations of calcium, magnesium, and for some sites dissolved iron. All of these parameters have higher values in summer and lower values in winter. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Winter Temperature Inversions and Emergency Department Visits for Asthma in Salt Lake County, Utah, 2003-2008	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES												BACKGROUND: Winter temperature inversions-layers of air in which temperature increases with altitude-trap air pollutants and lead to higher pollutant concentrations. Previous studies have evaluated associations between pollutants and emergency department (ED) visits for asthma, but none have considered inversions as independent risk factors for ED visits for asthma. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess associations between winter inversions and ED visits for asthma in Salt Lake County, Utah. METHODS: We obtained electronic records of ED visits for asthma and data on inversions, weather, and air pollutants for Salt Lake County, Utah, during the winters of 2003 through 2004 to 2007 through 2008. We identified 3,425 ED visits using a primary diagnosis of asthma. We used a time-stratified case-crossover design, and conditional logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to estimate rate ratios of ED visits for asthma in relation to inversions during a 4-day lag period and prolonged inversions. We evaluated interactions between inversions and weather and pollutants. RESULTS: After adjusting for dew point and mean temperatures, the OR for ED visits for asthma associated with inversions 0-3 days before the visit compared with no inversions during the lag period was 1.14 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.30). The OR for each 1-day increase in the number of inversion days during the lag period was 1.03 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.07). Associations were only apparent when PM10 and maximum and mean temperatures were above median levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence that winter inversions are associated with increased rates of ED visits for asthma.

J	Abrantes, N; Antunes, SC; Pereira, MJ; Gonçalves, F				Abrantes, N; Antunes, SC; Pereira, MJ; Gonçalves, F			Seasonal succession of cladocerans and phytoplankton and their interactions in a shallow eutrophic lake (Lake Vela, Portugal)	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Lake Vela is a polymictic shallow lake exhibiting some characteristics typical of an advanced trophic state, namely, the permanently turbid water, the reduction in biodiversity, and the recurrent occurrence of Cyanobacteria blooms, which occasionally lead to large fish kills. This study was carried out in order to understand the seasonal variation of Lake Vela's phytoplankton and cladoceran communities and their interactions under advanced eutrophic conditions. When comparing our results with general models of plankton succession observed in other temperate and tropical takes we found some coherence between several seasonal events. Our results suggest that phytoplankton is mainly regulated by nutrients ("bottom-up" effect). However, the warm mediteffanean temperatures had an important role in the phytoplankton succession, being responsible for the rapid and intense Cyanobacteria development in spring and summer. Our work also demonstrated that phytoplankton is one of the main factors responsible for the seasonal structure of the community of cladocerans, which are well related to changes in algae diversity and abundance, being the Cyanobacteria having major impact. Moreover, the occurrence of a massive Cyanobacteria bloom during the study, which induced anoxia and consequent fish kill, enhanced the structuring role that fish have on the cladoceran seasonal succession and the effects of this episode in the normal seasonal succession of plankton.

Six Cabernet franc vineyards were chosen throughout the Niagara region in Ontario. Data were collected at fruit set, lag phase, and veraison [soil water content (SWC), leaf w], at harvest (yield components, berry composition), and three times during winter (LT50; the temperature at which 50% of buds die) in the 2010-2012 seasons. Interpolation by kriging and mapping of variables was completed using ArcGIS, and statistical analyses (linear correlation, k-means clustering, principal components analysis, multilinear regression) were performed. Spatial trends were observed in each vineyard for SWC, leaf w, yield components, berry composition, and LT50. Geographic information systems (GIS) and statistical analysis revealed that leaf w could predict LT50, with strong positive correlations between LT50 and leaf w values in most vineyards in 2010-2011. In the dry 2012 season, leaf w (particularly at veraison; range -1.3 to -1.6 MPa) was positively correlated to LT50, yield, titratable acidity (TA), pH, and Brix and negatively to SWC, color, anthocyanins, and phenols. Overall, vineyards in different appellations (Niagara Lakeshore, Lincoln Lakeshore, Four Mile Creek, Beamsville Bench) showed many similarities. These results suggest that there is a spatial component to winter injury, as with other aspects of terroir. Furthermore, this study allows for means by which to compare winter hardiness to other critical variables to better understand the terroir of the Niagara region.

In this study, four different types of urban landscape lakes in Xi'an were selected, and the bacterial community structures in different seasons were analyzed by Illumina Nova high-throughput sequencing technology. Seasonal variations in bacterial communities were analyzed by linear discriminant analysis, STAMP difference analysis, and nonmetric multidimensional scaling. Redundancy analysis was used to investigate the influencing factors. Furthermore, the metabolic functions of bacterial communities were predicted by Tax4Fun. There were clear seasonal differences in the alpha-diversity of bacteria, with bacterial diversity being higher in winter than in summer in the four urban landscape lakes, and the diversity of different water sources was different; the distributions of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Verrucomicrobia had significant seasonal differences; and the dominant bacteria at the genus level had obvious temporal and spatial differences. Furthermore, a variety of environmental factors had an impact on bacterial communities, and temperature, DO, and nitrogen were the primary factors affecting the seasonal variation in bacteria. There are also significant seasonal differences in the metabolic functions of bacterial communities. These results are helpful for understanding the current status of bacteria in the aquatic environments of such urban landscape lakes.

A Holocene palaeoclimatic reconstruction from central Europe	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												The sedimentary sequence of a spring-fed fen located in north-east Poland was investigated to verify the applicability of spring-fed fen deposits in palaeoenvironmental studies. We hypothesize that spring-fed fen deposits accumulated on the hill slope are a reliable proxy for regional hydrological changes, although they may be modified by local factors. Results of combined sedimentological, plant macrofossil, geochemical and isotopic analyses were compared with palaeoclimatic reconstructions at the nearby lakes Purwin, Kojle and Perty situated within the same sedimentary basin. The 700-cm-long sediment sequence from the fen was deposited between 10 900 cal a BP and recent times. The sequence starts with a lacustrine stage, but ca. 9200 cal a BP the lake changed into a spring-fed fen functioning within a fen surrounding Lake Purwin. Highly variable SiO2 content and stable isotope (delta C-13 and delta O-18) values of carbonates, both controlled by inwash of detrital material from young glacial deposits, were found to reflect changes in hydrology with major regional shifts in climate humidity being recorded. Links were found with lake level changes and peatland record of humidity in northern and eastern Poland, the Baltic area and Central Europe, and with climatic records in Scandinavia.

Knowledge of the habitat selection of migrating birds is important from both a conservation and agro-economic point of view. We investigated the habitat preferences of three common migrating goose species: White-fronted Goose Anser albifrons, Bean Goose A. fabalis and Greylag Goose A. anser during the autumn of 2009 in western Poland. A total of 24 flocks of these species were identified. Geese preferred large, elevated fields that were remote from forests and human settlements but in close proximity to a lake. Geese selected maize stubbles and avoided winter cereals. They selected sites in landscapes with a lower diversity of crops. Flock size was negatively correlated with the proportion of pastures in the landscape, but it increased with field size, distance to forest and distance to town. Our results are in contrast with the paradigm that less intensive farmland positively influences habitat use by birds during foraging. We advise the delayed ploughing of stubbles with the aim of creating appropriate foraging habitats for geese and minimizing damage to cereal crops.					; Tryjanowski, Piotr/C-1367-2009; Rosin, Zuzanna/C-3824-2017; Skórka, Piotr/B-7218-2009; Tobolka, Marcin/ABG-2392-2021	Tryjanowski, Piotr/0000-0002-8358-0797; Skorka, Piotr/0000-0002-7486-2928; Skorka, Piotr/0000-0002-3221-296X; Rosin, Zuzanna Maria/0000-0002-7565-7547; Sparks, Tim/0000-0003-4382-7051; Tobolka, Marcin/0000-0002-4989-1524; Myczko, Lukasz/0000-0002-9305-2306													2193-7192	2193-7206				JUL	2012	153	3					747	759		10.1007/s10336-011-0791-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-011-0791-1													WOS:000305232700014
