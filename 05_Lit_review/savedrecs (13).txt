Under the policy, the significant modifications will occur in the allocation of land use resources within ethanol raw material cultivation regions. In the process of land use change, ensuring food provision and protecting the regional carbon sink are also crucial for sustainable development. This study explores carbon distribution in the Guiping section of the Yujiang River basin, where bioethanol raw materials are cultivated. Using the CLUE-S model, a multi-objective model prioritizing economic and ecological benefits is constructed. Four scenarios (i. e., the natural expansion scenario (NES); the food conservation scenario (FCS); the bioethanol feedstock conservation scenario (BCS), and the carbon sinks conservation scenario (CCS) are simulated, predicting land resource distribution by 2030. The total carbon sink decreased by 285.60 gC center dot m(-2)center dot a(-1), showing a seasonal trend of higher levels in summer and lower levels in winter. In 2030, the total carbon sink decreased in the NES scenario, while it increased in the FCS and BCS scenarios. The CCS scenario had the largest increase, approximately 582.27 x 10 3 tC. These simulated scenarios consider various economic and environmental factors, providing a scientific basis for the efficient allocation of regional land resources. They also have significant implications for local energy, economic, and environmentally sustainable development, as well as promoting the achievement of carbon neutrality.

Drought-induced sulphate release from a wetland in south-central Ontario	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Increased sulphate (SO4) export from wetlands following summer droughts in central Ontario, Canada has been associated with the delayed chemical recovery of downstream surface waters following decreased sulphur (S) emissions. Prolonged summer droughts result in a decrease or cessation of stream flow, declines in wetland water table level and oxidation of reduced S compounds to SO4, which is subsequently flushed into drainage streams when stream flow resumes. Sulphate input-output budget calculations (1983-1995 and 1999-2001) at a conifer Sphagnum swamp in the Plastic Lake catchment, indicate that SO4 is retained in most years but is exported on a net basis following particularly severe summer droughts that result in the cessation of stream flow for more than 54 days (95% CI: 41-72 days). Hindcast calculations using long-term (1916-2000) stream discharge records from a nearby station indicate that while droughts occurred frequently in south-central Ontario over the past 85 years, sufficiently dry conditions to cause net SO4 export occurred in only18 of the past 85 years, and indicate a cumulative positive SO4 balance for the swamp (i.e. net SO4 retention). Furthermore, the S pool at the Plastic Lake swamp has been estimated to be similar to 1500 kg S/ha in the upper 40 cm peat layer, which is large compared to the amount of net SO4 export that occurs even in years with particularly dry summers (e.g. -43 kg S/ha in 1987/88). Together, these data suggest that the wetland S pool at Plastic Lake has not been depleted by previous droughts and will continue to sustain episodic drought-related SO4 export for the foreseeable future.

J	Qiu, C; Zhu, JR				Qiu, Cheng; Zhu, Jian-Rong			Influence of seasonal runoff regulation by the Three Gorges Reservoir on saltwater intrusion in the Changjiang River Estuary	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) is the largest water conservancy project in the world. It significantly regulates discharge of the Changjiang River on a seasonal scale. It stores water in autumn and drains it during the following dry season. Although the effects of the TGR on various processes in the river, estuary, and adjacent seas have been studied extensively, the TGR's influence on saltwater intrusion around the estuary and its impacts on vital freshwater reservoirs have not been quantitatively evaluated. In this study, we used a well-validated numerical model to simulate the seasonal-scale saltwater intrusion around the Changjiang Estuary under scenarios with and without the TGR regulation. Results showed that during the autumn season, the TGR advanced the timing of saltwater intrusion and slightly increased its intensity. In contrast, as the TGR supplemented river discharge during the dry season, saltwater intrusion around the freshwater reservoirs was significantly suppressed. Moreover, duration of saline water (salinity >0.45, the standard for drinking water) at the Dongfengxisha, Chenhang, and Qingcaosha Reservoirs was shortened by about 16%, 73.1%, and 48%, respectively. The model results showed that overall, operation of the TGR is basically favorable for reducing the burden of freshwater supplement in the high-populated estuarine region. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

They are very important in urban areas, and in the northern latitudes, recreation activities are relevant in winter when the lake is frozen. To ensure the safety of activities, it is important that the temperature of lake ice be monitored. In this work, we developed a methodological framework to assess ice temperature in lakes during the winter using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The steps followed were: 1) UAV mission planning, 2) field data collection, 3) mission reconstruction, 4) data extraction, and 5) statistical and spatial analysis. The method developed in this work can be useful for local authorities to assess and monitor ice lake temperature during the winter and ensure the safety of these areas for recreation. The method can be applied to lakes located in different environments. center dot A new framework was developed to assess and monitor lake temperatures during the winter. center dot High resolution thermal Unmanned Aerial Vehicle was used to assess lake temperature. center dot The method can be helpful for local authorities to ensure urban lakes' safety for winter recreation.

J	Kraller, G; Strasser, U; Franz, H				Kraller, Gabriele; Strasser, Ulrich; Franz, Helmut			Effect of Alpine karst on the hydrology of the Berchtesgadener Ache basin: a comprehensive summary of karst research in the Berchtesgaden Alps	ECO MONT-JOURNAL ON PROTECTED MOUNTAIN AREAS RESEARCH												The Berchtesgaden Alps are situated in the Northern Limestone Alps, characterized by individual mountain plateaus and ridges in close proximity to each other, intersected by valleys, with an altitudinal gradient of 2100 meters. The limestone has been exposed to dissolution processes since the Cretaceous, leading to a massive karstified aquifer with a wide range of subsurface flow channels. There are hundreds of springs as groundwater recharge locations, feeding the seven rivers of the region that contribute to the Danube watershed. Several studies were conducted to examine the hydro-geological conditions and the resulting groundwater flow. This paper aims to evaluate and summarize research in the basin describing groundwater flow to identify the main drainage direction, travel times, spring dynamics and possible subsurface redistribution in the individual mountain ranges and the whole basin. To this end, we evaluate several tracer experiments, two isotope studies and a spring database. The tracer experiments are generating knowledge about flow directions in the individual mountain ranges, groundwater redistribution, water storage and mean travel times. Five experiments prove increased groundwater flow remaining within a valley and four experiments indicate groundwater redistribution through mountain ranges. The isotope studies indicate potential water storage in the Wimbach valley of an estimated 100x10(6) to 470x10(6) m(3) and mean transit times of about four years. The analysis of the spring database focuses on locations and discharge classification. Overall, there are 289 springs recorded in the spring database, distributed from 600 to over 2000 m altitude, with major springs at the northern base of the mountains Hochkalter, Watzmann and at the north shore of lake Konigssee. The conclusion summarizes the effect of the karst aquifer on the hydrology of the region. The outlook introduces current research within the area and the distributed water balance modelling.

Plasticity in life history has allowed the species to persist in a diversity of challenging Holarctic environments. Despite their ecological and cultural importance and their presence in aquatic ecosystems that are ice-covered for much of the year, few under-ice studies of Arctic char have been conducted. Most winter studies of adult Arctic char have focused on lakes, where they typically overwinter. Several populations of Arctic char, however, overwinter in large river systems, and subsistence fishers have reported that Arctic char overwinter in the lower reaches of the Coppermine River. The Coppermine River is a large Arctic river that flows into Coronation Gulf near Kugluktuk, Nunavut, Canada. The authors used acoustic telemetry to investigate the overwintering ecology of Arctic char in the region. Consistent with local knowledge, they detected Arctic char overwintering within the fluvial environment of the Coppermine River from 2018 to 2020. Unlike other fluvial environments known to be used by overwintering Arctic char, the lower reaches of the Coppermine River are completely ice-covered throughout the winter, are of moderate depths (3.8-14.1 m) and have no known groundwater inputs. Acoustic telemetry observations indicated long-distance movement (7-8 km) within the river in early winter (October) in response to dynamic ice formation. Under-ice movement generally declined 2 weeks after river freeze-up but continued throughout winter in the lower 5 km of the river, where there were fewer under-ice disturbances. Migration into the marine environment before river ice break-up (June), as well as winter (November-May) movements into and within the marine environment, was unexpectedly observed for some fish. Under-ice use of the marine environment is unusual for Arctic char at the distances observed (up to 18 km) and has not previously been documented at the temperatures (fish body temperatures from -0.76 to 1.90 degrees C) observed. Results allow further understanding of the diverse life-history tactics employed by Arctic char and lay a foundation for future research into fluvial and other diverse overwintering tactics employed by the species.					; Smith, Rosie/HTN-3627-2023; kristensen, kent/KSM-2823-2024	Loewen, Tracey/0000-0002-7466-9116; Smith, Rosie/0000-0003-2675-4452; Swanson, Heidi/0000-0003-0457-8769; 													0022-1112	1095-8649				JUN	2022	100	6					1432	1446		10.1111/jfb.15054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.15054		APR 2022						35362094					WOS:000782788700001
J	Singh, Y; Jain, MK				Singh, Yuvraj; Jain, Manish Kumar			Assessment of physicochemical parameters and metal contents of Mansagar lake of Jaipur	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The state of Rajasthan of India is predominantly classified as a dry state and therefore its freshwater and agricultural resources are the prime concern for the people and the state agencies. This article presents the analytical study of physicochemical parameters of Mansagar lake Jaipur, India. Our prime objective was to find the quantity and effects of effluents mixing with the water of Jalmahal Lake (officially known as Mansagar lake). Standard approaches were applied to calculate the water quality index (WQI) for the assessment of its surface water for two consecutive years. The values of physicochemical parameters have been calculated before and after the rainy season and the study has been presented in a detailed form. The variation of parameters like COD with heavy metals like lead and zinc have been analyzed and it is found that due to the increase in metal content the COD increased as high as 500 mg/l in rainy while it is as low as 200 before the rainy season. The values of various physiochemical parameters like BOD, COD, conductivity, and turbidity were also observed throughout the year at the various front of the lake and it has been observed that pollutants presence increases in peak summer and late winters. It's noticeable that turbidity and conductivity were normally high in June-July thereby increased pollution concentration in the remaining water levels.

Late Pleistocene (MIS2) environmental changes and palaeoclimatic dynamics around Aiding Lake in the Turpan Basin, Xinjiang Province, NW-China	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GEOMORPHOLOGIE					Annual Conference of the German-Geomorphologists-Working-Group	2013	Catholic Univ Eichstatt Ingolstadt, GERMANY	German Geomorphologists Working Grp	Catholic Univ Eichstatt Ingolstadt			A 12 m sediment core from the Aiding Lake basin in the today hyper-arid Turpan depression (Autonomous Xinjiang Province, NW-China) has been studied. The core, which was drilled near the deepest point of the endorheic Turpan basin (154 m below sea level), revealed several climatic and palaeoenvironmental changes during the Late Pleistocene. The sediments which were analyzed relating to sedimentology (grain size), geochemistry (Ti/Al ratio, chemical index of weathering, total organic and inorganic carbon, sulfur, nitrogen), and magnetic susceptibility, are of fluvial, eolian, and lacustrine origin. Age control was done by five C-14 dates. Reservoir effects for the stratigraphic units were considered. Less saline conditions lasted until the end of the Pleistocene, forced by stronger westerlieS and low, but increasing temperatures. Sometime after Dansgaard-Oeschger event 1 (14.6 ka) up to present, environmental conditions were arid and Aiding became a salt lake. High sand contents indicate eolian input during a period of cold, windy and arid conditions, associated with Heinrich event 2 (-24.8-23.4 ka cal BP; HEMMING 2004), whereas high sand input of the uppermost 2 m and salt accumulation reflects a general change to drier conditions since the Pleistocene/Holocene transition. In summary, the Lake decreased from its maximum size of around 3000 km(2) during the MIS3 to a seasonal small lake today. The measured Rb/Sr ratio, generally used as an indicator for weathering conditions of lake catchments, with reduced Sr influx during arid periods due to weak chemical weathering, has to be interpreted differently for Aiding Lake: Very low Rb/Sr ratios in the uppermost 2.7m similar to that of unweathered loess represent the recent drought and Sr accumulation during the Holocene. Contrary to other studies, we found e.g. that Rb/Sr dynamics do not indicate the intensity of past chemical weathering, but allows the distinction of different source areas and the decoupling of weathering and subsequent transport to the sink. This is consistent to the westerly index, according to AN et al. (2012), which was calculated to separate eolian from fluvial influx. Our study shows that the interpretation of palaeoclimate proxies depends on the understanding of the entire process-response-system within a specific catchment and environment. In summary and in comparison to other regional studies, we can distinguish six palaeoclimatic phases: A) with strong westerlies and cold-wet climate (c. 28.5-24.8 ka BP); B) with very strong winter monsoon and very cold climate (24.8-23.4 ka BP); C) with strong winter monsoon and cold climate, merging to cold more humid conditions due to enhancing westerlies (23.4 - similar to 20.5 ka BP). Phase D showed strongly reduced eolian dynamics afterwards and was a period of cool-wet conditions with weakening westerlies and a geomorphological stability in the Turpan basin (until similar to 16 ka). Phase E was dominated by the cold-dry spell of Heinrich event 1(15.8-14.6 ka BP), eolian transport was reactivated by high winter monsoon wind speeds, and fluvial discharge decreased. During the D/O1 warming (after 14.6 ka BP), material was merely transported from the melting mountain glaciers to the lake. In the Turpan basin, warm and dry conditions led to a sealing of surfaces by biocrusts, which again suppressed eolian processes. Phase F started with the transition to hot-very dry Holocene climate. It experienced enhanced seasonality (stronger winter and summer monsoon) and marks a period when the propagation of moist westerly air masses to the Turpan basin was prevented.																			0372-8854						2016	60			1			5	27		10.1127/zfg_suppl/2015/S-00194	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/zfg_suppl/2015/S-00194													WOS:000375236000002
J	Xu, RC; Pang, Y; Hu, ZB; Hu, XY				Xu, Ruichen; Pang, Yong; Hu, Zhibing; Hu, Xiaoyan			The Spatiotemporal Characteristics of Water Quality and Main Controlling Factors of Algal Blooms in Tai Lake, China	SUSTAINABILITY												Taking Tai Lake in China as the research area, a 3D water environment mathematical model was built. Combined with the LHS and Morris uncertainty and sensitivity analysis methods, the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), dissolved oxygen (DO), and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) were carried out. The main conclusions are: (1) The performance assessment of the 3D water environment mathematical model is good (R-2 and NSE > 0.8) and is suitable for water quality research in large shallow lakes. (2) The time uncertainty study proves that the variation range of Chl-a is much larger than that of the other three water quality parameters and is more severe in summer and autumn. (3) The spatial uncertainty study proves that Chl-a is mainly present in the northwest lake area (heavily polluted area) and the other three water quality indicators are mainly present in the center. (4) The sensitivity results show that the main controlling factors of DO are ters (0.15) and kmsc (0.12); those of TN and TP are tetn (0.58) and tetp (0.24); and those of Chl-a are its own growth rate (0.14), optimal growth temperature (0.12), death rate (0.12), optimal growth light (0.11), and TP uptake rate (0.11). Thus, TP control is still the key treatment method for algal blooms that can be implemented by the Chinese government.

However, other atmospheric circulation modes (ACMs), such as the East Atlantic (EA) and Scandinavian (SCAND) patterns, also play significant roles. The dynamics of lakes on the Iberian Peninsula are greatly controlled by climatic parameters, but their relationship with these various ACMs has not been investigated in detail. In this paper, we analyze monthly meteorological and limnological long-term datasets (1950-2011 and 1992-2011, respectively) from two lakes on the northern and central Iberian Peninsula (Sanabria and Las Madres) to develop an understanding of the seasonal sensitivity of these freshwater systems to the NAO, EA and SCAND circulation modes. The limnological variability within Lake Sanabria is primarily controlled by fluctuations in the seasonal precipitation and wind, and the primary ACMs associated with the winter limnological processes are the NAO and the SCAND modes, whereas only the EA mode appears to weakly influence processes during the summer. However, Lake Las Madres is affected by precipitation, wind and, to a lesser extent, temperature, whereas the ACMs have less influence. Therefore, we aim to show that the lakes of the Iberian Peninsula are sensitive to these ACMs. The results presented here indicate that the lake dynamics, in some cases, have a higher sensitivity to variations in the ACMs than single local meteorological variables. However, certain local features, such as geography, lake morphology and anthropic influences, are crucial to properly record the signals of these ACMs.					Jambrina-Enríquez, Margarita/C-8130-2019; Pla-Rabes, Sergi/J-9209-2012; Jerez, Sonia/A-7420-2013; Giralt, Santiago/G-4823-2011; Garcés, Blas/L-4246-2014; Giralt, Santiago/AAA-8585-2020; Trigo, Ricardo/B-7044-2008; Hernandez, Armand/K-6606-2012	Pla-Rabes, Sergi/0000-0003-3532-9466; Jerez, Sonia/0000-0002-2153-1658; Giralt, Santiago/0000-0001-8570-7838; Trigo, Ricardo/0000-0002-4183-9852; Jambrina-Enriquez, Margarita/0000-0001-7545-9164; Hernandez, Armand/0000-0001-7245-9863													0930-7575	1432-0894				DEC	2015	45	11-12					3403	3417		10.1007/s00382-015-2547-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-015-2547-8													WOS:000365418900027

In 2017-18, depositing dust was collected approximately monthly at five sites in the Salton Sea Basin and analyzed for total elemental and soluble anion content. These data were analyzed with Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF). The PMF method resolved seven dust sources with distinct compositional markers: Playa (Mg, SO42-, Na, Ca, Sr), Colorado Alluvium (U, Ca), Local Alluvium (Al, Fe, Ti), Agricultural Burning (K, PO43-), Sea Spray (Na, Cl-, Se), Anthropogenic Trace Metals (Sb, As, Zn, Cd, Pb, Na), and Anthropogenic Copper (Cu). All sources except Local Alluvium are influenced or caused by current or historic anthropogenic activities. PMF attributed 55 to 80% of the measured dust flux to these six sources. The dust fluxes at the site where the playa source was dominant (89 g m(-2) yr(-1)) were less than, but approaching the scale of, those observed at Owens Lake playas in the late 20th century. Playa emissions in the Salton Sea region were most intense during the late spring to early summer and contain high concentrations of evaporite mineral tracers, particularly Mg, Ca, and SO42-.					; Lyons, Timothy/ADT-8795-2022; Maltz, Mia/JGD-5930-2023; Bahreini, Roya/KEI-5733-2024; Aronson, Emma/I-3277-2012	Ying, Samantha/0000-0002-1247-2529; Maltz, Mia/0000-0001-9714-3566; Schaefer, Michael/0000-0001-6255-3362; Frie, Alexander/0000-0002-9223-8408; Aronson, Emma/0000-0002-5018-2688													0013-936X	1520-5851				AUG 20	2019	53	16					9378	9388		10.1021/acs.est.9b02137	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b02137								31339712					WOS:000482521600006

A 2600-year history of floods in the Bernese Alps, Switzerland: frequencies, mechanisms and climate forcing	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												A 2600-year long composite palaeoflood record is reconstructed from high-resolution delta plain sediments of the Hasli-Aare floodplain on the northern slope of the Swiss Alps. Natural proxies compiled from sedimentary, geochemical and geomorphological data were calibrated by textual and factual sources and instrumental data. No fewer than 12 of the 14 historically recorded extreme events between 1480 and the termination of the Hasli-Aare river channel correction in 1875 were also identified by coarse-grained flood layers, log(Zr/Ti) peaks and factor 1 anomalies. Geomorphological, historical and instrumental data provide evidence for flood damage intensities and discharge estimations of severe and catastrophic historical floods. Spectral analysis of the geochemical and documentary flood series and several climate proxies (TSI, delta O-18, tree-rings, NAO, SNAO) identify similar periodicities of around 60, 80, 100, 120 and 200 years during the last millennia, indicating the influence of the North Atlantic circulation and solar forcing on alpine flood dynamics. The composite floodplain record illustrates that periods of organic soil formation and deposition of phyllosilicates (from the medium high catchment area) match those of total solar irradiance maxima, suggesting reduced flood activity during warmer climate pulses. Aggradation with multiple sets of flood layers with increased contribution of siliciclasts from the highest catchment area (plutonic bedrock) (e.g. 1300-1350, 1420 1480, 1550-1620, 1650-1720 and 1811-1851 cal yr AD) occurred predominantly during periods with reduced solar irradiance, lower ffi 18O anomalies, cooler summer temperatures and phases of drier spring climate in the Alps. Increased water storage by glaciers, snow cover and snow patches susceptible to melting processes associated with rainfall episodes and abrupt rises in temperature substantially increased surface runoff on slopes and discharges of alpine rivers. This interpretation is in agreement with the findings that the severe and catastrophic historical floods in the Aare since 1670 occurred mostly during positive SNAO (Summer North Atlantic Oscillation) pulses after years or even decades dominated by negative SNAO and cooler annual temperatures.

Stable isotope analyses reveal predation on amphibians by a globally invasive fish (Gambusia holbrooki)	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. Biodiversity loss caused by invasive species is particularly problematic in freshwater ecosystems, which are among the world's most threatened habitats. Invasive fish such as the eastern mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, have been implicated in the decline of amphibians, which suffer high extinction rates globally. Although G. holbrooki is one of the most studied freshwater fish, its diet shows wide geographic variation and its impact on amphibian populations remains unclear. 2. Stable isotopes C-13 and N-15 were used in 10 urban ponds in Sydney, Australia to compare the diet of G. holbrooki in January, April and May 2013 using a stable isotope mixing model. 3. Gambusia holbrooki was carnivorous and fed on invertebrates (24-39%), tadpoles (25-32%) and conspecifics (20-45%). In contrast to previous studies, primary producers were a negligible part of Gambusia holbrooki diet (<10%). Its diet in late autumn comprised a high proportion of conspecifics (up to 45%) owing to the depletion of other food sources before winter (metamorphosis of larvae). 4. This study provides evidence of high rates of predation on native tadpoles and invertebrates by a highly invasive fish. This knowledge should be incorporated into amphibian releases through head-starting tadpoles or using soft releases where tadpoles are placed in predator-free enclosures until larvae are large enough to avoid predation. Considering the dire conservation status of amphibians globally and the growing interest for invertebrates, it is suggested that stable isotopes are valuable to identify threats from predation in order to target conservation practice toward suitable priorities.

Response of emergent macrophytes to hydrological changes in a shallow lake, with special reference to nutrient cycling	HYDROBIOLOGIA					12th International Symposium on Aquatic Weeds	AUG 24-28, 2009	Jyvaskyla, FINLAND	European Weed Res Soc				The effect of water level reduction on nutrient concentrations and productivity of emergent macrophytes was analyzed in a shallow, polymictic lake, located in Central-Western Poland. The water level was regulated for irrigation purposes from 1974 to 2002, with an average amplitude of 0.85 m. In 2002, the water level was reduced by 0.60 m during winter time and by 0.40 m in summer time. Nutrient concentrations, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium standing stocks and aboveground biomass production were compared among four vegetation types along with a moisture gradient in the littoral zone. This study was conducted in the littoral zone of Lake Niepruszewskie during the growing seasons in 1999-2001 (1st period with high water level) and 2005-2008 (2nd period with low water level). The reduction of water level resulted in a negative effect on biomass production and nutrient concentrations. Stoichiometric indexes, like N:P and N:K ratios, indicate that the shift in nutrient limitation due to changes in hydrological conditions caused a reduction of the nutrient uptake by vegetation and affected productivity. The decrease in the aboveground biomass production was more marked at sites that were less affected by drainage, i.e., permanently flooded. However, in drawdown areas, plant growth decreased. Species including Phragmites australis and Carex acutiformis coped better with the reduction of water levels than Typha angustifolia and Glyceria maxima.

The fumaroles are characterized by low-temperature, HC1-and S-rich gas and numerous hyper-acid pools (pH < 1) without drains. At similar to 550 m asl, in the Yurieva stream canyon, many hot (up to 87 degrees C) springs discharge ultra-acidic (pH 1-2) SO4-Cl water into the stream and finally into the Sea of Okhotsk. During quiescent stages of degassing, these fumaroles emit 1000-2000 t/d of water vapor, <20 t/d of SO2 and <5 t/d of HCl. The measurement of acidic hot Yurieva springs shows that the flux of Cl and S, 60-80 t/d each, is independent on the volcanic activity in the last two decades. Such high flux of Cl is among the highest ever measured in a volcano-hydrothermal system. Oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of water and Cl concentration for Yurieva springs show an excellent positive correlation, indicating a mixing between meteoric water and magmatic vapor. In contrast, volcanic gas condensates of Ebeko fumaroles do not show a simple mixing trend but rather a complicated data suggesting evaporation of the acidic brine. Temperatures calculated from gas compositions and isotope data are similar, ranging from 150 to 250 degrees C, which is consistent with the presence of a liquid aquifer below the Ebeko fumarolic fields. Saturation indices of non-silicate minerals suggest temperatures ranging from 150 to 200 degrees C for Yurieva springs. Trace elements (including REE) and Sr isotope composition suggest congruent dissolution of the Ebeko volcanic rocks by acidic waters. Waters of Yurieva springs and waters of the summit thermal fields (including volcanic gas condensates) are different in Cl/SO4 ratios and isotopic compositions, suggesting complicated boiling-condensation mixing processes.

The final aim was to gauge the effects of the spring output on the lake hydrology. The time scope of the work included the period from January 2011 to September 2012. The spatial scope of the work included the area of Lake Raduskie Gorne and its direct catchment located in the Kashubian Lake District in northern Poland. Four groundwater outflows were located in the course of the study. Their total output was 4.6 Ls(-1) and ranged between 0.5 and 2.5 Ls(-1). This produces an annual yield of about 145 000m(3) year(-1). These results confirm that one of the forms of supply to the lakes are the under-lake springs. For lakes located in the area of young glacial accumulation this can be decisive.					; Cieslinski, Roman/A-5427-2008	Cieslinski, Roman/0000-0002-5313-1923; 													0262-6667	2150-3435				OCT	2016	61	13					2427	2434		10.1080/02626667.2015.1112903	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2015.1112903													WOS:000383408700010

This study aims to investigate the influence of local sources of anthropogenic PAHs and their air-water exchange fluxes in an oligotrophic North-Patagonian lake in Chile. The monitoring was carried out in Panguipulli Lake during a six-month period during the autumn and winter seasons (March to August 2017) using a high-volume air sampler and a pump system for water samples. We detected and quantified fifteen PAHs in the gas phase (mean Sigma(15)PAHs - 11.6 ng m(-3)) and dissolved water phase (mean Sigma(15)PAHs - 961.8 pg L-1). Methylphenanthrenes and pyrene dominated the concentrations of PAHs in the studied phases. To determine sources of PAHs we used the PAH ratios of Light Molecular Weight/Heavy Molecular Weight (Sigma LMW/Sigma HMW) and Phenanthrene/Anthracene (Phe/Ant). The PAH ratio results revealed a pyrogenic source. We estimated the air-water diffusive exchange fluxes and fugacity ratios for the studied compounds. In general, air-water diffusive exchanges of PAHs showed a net volatilization for the less hydrophobic (log K-ow < 4) and lighter PAHs (MW <= 170 g mol(-1)), and a net deposition trend for the more hydrophobic (log K-ow 4-7) and higher molecular weight PAHs (MW >= 178 g mol(-1)). We found a significant correlation between log water/air fugacity ratios and log K-ow of PAHs. Therefore, it is suggested that this oligotrophic lake acts as a sink by accumulating hydrophobic and mid-high molecular weight PAHs derived mainly from pyrogenic sources. This study is the first attempt to understand the sources and behavior of PAHs in oligotrophic lakes in the Southern Chile where information is scarce regarding the occurrence of PAHs.

Understanding coastal wetland conditions and futures by closing their hydrologic balance: the case of the Gialova lagoon, Greece	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Coastal wetlands and lagoons are under pressure due to competing demands for freshwater resources and climatic changes, which may increase salinity and cause a loss of ecological functions. These pressures are particularly high in Mediterranean regions with high evaporative demand compared to precipitation. To manage such wetlands and maximize their provision of ecosystem services, their hydrologic balance must be quantified. However, multiple channels, diffuse surface water exchanges, and diverse groundwater pathways complicate the quantification of different water balance components. To overcome this difficulty, we developed a mass balance approach based on coupled water and salt balance equations to estimate currently unknown water exchange fluxes through the Gialova lagoon, southwestern Peloponnese, Greece. Our approach facilitates quantification of both saline and freshwater exchange fluxes, using measured precipitation, water depth and salinity, and estimated evaporation rates over a study period of 2 years (2016-2017). While water exchanges were dominated by evaporation and saline water inputs from the sea during the summer, precipitation and freshwater inputs were more important during the winter. About 40 % and 60 % of the freshwater inputs were from precipitation and lateral freshwater flows, respectively. Approximately 70 % of the outputs was due to evaporation, with the remaining 30 % being water flow from the lagoon to the sea. Under future drier and warmer conditions, salinity in the lagoon is expected to increase, unless freshwater inputs are enhanced by restoring hydrologic connectivity between the lagoon and the surrounding freshwater bodies. This restoration strategy would be fundamental to stabilizing the current wide seasonal fluctuations in salinity and maintain ecosystem functionality but could be challenging to implement due to expected reductions in water availability in the freshwater bodies supporting the lagoon.					; Manzoni, Stefano/C-5330-2009; Destouni, Georgia/M-9662-2016; Scaini, Anna/AAU-2759-2021; Psiloglou, Basil/AAF-7865-2021; Lyon, Steve/AAL-9358-2021	Maneas, Georgios/0000-0001-7152-669X; Manzoni, Stefano/0000-0002-5960-5712; Destouni, Georgia/0000-0001-9408-4425; Scaini, Anna/0000-0002-3527-0241; 													1027-5606	1607-7938				JUL 15	2020	24	7					3557	3571		10.5194/hess-24-3557-2020	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-3557-2020													WOS:000551470700002

In this study, ship rats (Rattus rattus) were captured in traps set along a 2 km elevational transect (455-1585 m a.s.l.) in beech (Nothofagaceae) forest and adjacent alpine tussock at Mt Misery, in Nelson Lakes National Park, from 1974 to 1993. A total of 118 rats were captured. In years with beech seed fall, upper range limits corresponded with the red beech forest (Fuscospora fusca) limit (similar to 1030 m a.s.l.), with no rats caught above this line in the silver (Lophozonia menziesii) and mountain (F. clffortioides) beech forest (1050-1408 m a.s.l.) or alpine zone (1425-1585 m a.s.l.). Binary generalised linear models indicated there is an indirect relationship between ship rat capture and temperature, as beech seed production, as well as decreasing elevation, were important predictors of rat capture. There was some evidence to suggest decreasing winter temperature and increasing annual precipitation also influenced ship rat capture and warrants further investigation. Our analyses provide an important insight into the drivers of ship rat elevational distribution, as well as providing a benchmark for comparing both current and future ship rat elevational distributions. Interrogation of more recent rat monitoring data from a range of beech forest types and sites is needed to test hypotheses around how warming temperatures, as predicted with climate change, will both directly and indirectly effect ship rat distribution.																			0110-6465	1177-7788					2017	41	1					113	119		10.20417/nzjecol.41.16	http://dx.doi.org/10.20417/nzjecol.41.16													WOS:000393847100012

This study analyzes the temporal variation of delta 2H and delta 18O in precipitation and its influencing factors based on samples of precipitation events in Lake Dali during summer from 2018 to 2020. The results showed significant monthly isotopic variability, characterised by lower delta 2H and delta 18O values in July with averages of -103.62 parts per thousand and -14.87 parts per thousand, respectively. This clear isotopic variability is largely related to the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) activity during the prevailing summer monsoon season and hydrometeorological processes. The isotopic composition of precipitation is mainly determined by the amount of precipitation and relative humidity, but not related to temperature. The results of backward trajectory modelling show that precipitation primarily originates from northern China, inland Xinjiang, and the western Pacific with different monthly contributions. The increase in delta 2H and delta 18O isotopes from June to August indicates sub-cloud evaporation. The mean sub-cloud evaporation rate was 3.5% during the summer. Sub-cloud evaporation is associated with relative humidity and precipitation. Recycled moisture accounts for 12% of local precipitation and 2.5%-31.6% of total monthly precipitation. After considering the contribution of evaporation, the estimated average recycling ratio increased from 12% to 24%, suggesting the important role of evaporation processes in lakes in the formation of precipitation.

Despite the longevity of irrigation, its effects on the quality and quantity of groundwater is poorly known and so is investigated here through seasonal measurements of hydraulic heads and water quality in groundwaters, rivers, lake, springs and rainwaters. In the north of the study region, an unconfined coarse-grained alluvial aquifer, infiltration of surface irrigation water, sourced from the Oglio River and low in NO3, contributes much to aquifer recharge (up to 88%, as evidenced by a delta H-2-Cl/Br mixing model) and has positive effects on groundwater quality by diluting high concentrations of NO3 (decrease by 17% between June and September). This recharge also helps to maintain numerous local springs that form important local micro-environments. Any increase in water-use efficiency in irrigation will reduce this recharge, imperil the spring environments, and lessen the dilution of NO3 leading to increasing NO3 concentrations in groundwater. These findings can be extended by analogy to the entire Po Plain region and other surface-water-irrigated systems worldwide where inefficient irrigation methods are used and similar hydrogeological features occur.

Integrating ranch forage production, cattle performance, and economics in ranch management systems for southern Florida	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												The presence of grazing cattle near open waterways has created environmental concerns related to the potential for water contamination. In Florida the removal of cattle from grazing landscapes or decreasing stocking density is being investigated as one option to improve the quality of surface water runoff draining into Lake Okeechobee, Florida. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of stocking rate on cow-calf performance, forage availability and quality, and ranch economic performance. Experimental pastures were established on a southern Florida cow-calf operation with stocking rates of 0.58, 1.01, and 1.35 ha . cow(-1) on summer pastures and 0.93, 1.62, and 2.16 ha . cow(-1) on winter pastures, corresponding to high, medium, and low rates, respectively. The study was conducted over 4 consecutive production years. Cow body condition scores (BCS), pregnancy rate, and calf average daily gain were used as measures of animal performance. Forage utilization was estimated by measuring the difference between forage yield inside and outside grazing exclusion cages and forage quality by crude protein and in vitro organic matter digestibility. Forage yield, utilization, and quality were not significantly affected by stocking rate. Although statistically not significant (P = 0.17), cattle in the high stocking rate experienced a numerically greater loss of BCS following the winter grazing period, but stocking rate did not affect pregnancy rate or calf gains. Production (kg weaned calves . ha(-1)) was increased (P < 0.01) for a high stocking rate compared with medium and low stocking rates. Overall ranch profitability will decrease as stocking rates decline. Ranch revenues decrease one-for-one as stocking rates decrease. At the same time, unit cow costs increase at an increasing rate as fewer brood cows are left to support the ranch's fixed cost structure.

J	Gergel, SE; Turner, MG; Kratz, TK				Gergel, SE; Turner, MG; Kratz, TK			Dissolved organic carbon as an indicator of the scale of watershed influence on lakes and rivers	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Land use and land cover can have a significant impact on water chemistry, but the spatial scales at which landscape attributes exert a detectable influence on aquatic systems are not well known. This study quantifies the extent of the landscape influence using the proportion of wetlands in the watershed measured at different distances to predict dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in Wisconsin lakes and rivers, and to determine whether the watershed influence varies with season or hydrologic type of lake. The proportion of wetlands in the total watershed often explained the most variability of DOC in lakes when stepwise regression was used. However, best-model techniques revealed that, for lakes, r(2) values often only differed 1-3% between models using the proportion of wetlands in the total watershed and models using only the proportion of wetlands in nearshore riparian areas (25-100 m). In rivers, the proportion of wetlands in the watershed always explained considerably more of the variability in DOC than did the proportion of wetlands in the nearshore riparian zone. The watershed influence also varied seasonally in rivers, as the proportion of the watershed covered by wetlands explained more of the variability in DOC in the fall than in the spring. Overall, the proportion of wetlands in the landscape explained much more of the variability of DOC concentrations in rivers than in lakes.

Mail questionnaires were sent out in the summer/fall of 2005 to the three types of users: (1) residential dock owners; (2) annual boat permit holders; and (3) temporary boat permit holders. Results highlight the similarities between residential dock owners and annual boat permit holders, and the differences between these two groups and temporary boat permit holders. Residential dock owners and annual boat permit holders have a longer history of involvement with Lake George, spend more time on the Lake, and are more likely to be concerned about crowding-related and safety issues than temporary boat permit holders. Recreation planners can use the results of this analysis to inform planning and communication with stakeholders on Lake George issues and perhaps other areas with similar types of recreational boaters.																									2006		P-14					589	+																WOS:000250664700077
J	Wahl, ER; Diaz, HF; Ohlwein, C				Wahl, Eugene R.; Diaz, Henry F.; Ohlwein, Christian			A pollen-based reconstruction of summer temperature in central North America and implications for circulation patterns during medieval times	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												We present a reconstruction of mean summer temperature for the northern Midwest of the USA based on lacustrine pollen records from three different lakes in Wisconsin. The results suggest a relatively warm period during the earlier part of the record (similar to 1200-1500 CE) followed by a cooler Little Ice Age (similar to 1500-1900) and a subsequent warming to modern conditions. The reconstructed modern summer mean temperature is in good agreement with observations, and the decades of the 1930s to 1950s appear to be the warmest such period in the proxy record (through 1974). Analyses of circulation features associated with the warmest summers in the recent climate record suggest a prevalence of continental ridging accompanied by generally dry conditions during these warm summers in the Midwest. Drought reconstruction using the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and tree-ring records as predictors also yield relatively dry conditions in medieval times for the central US. As reported in a number of recent studies, possible forcing mechanisms include La Nina-like conditions in the equatorial Pacific and warmer than average waters in the tropical Indo-western Pacific Ocean possibly coupled to a positive mode of the AMO/NAO North Atlantic circulation pattern.

Eleven- and ten-year basic cycles of Lake Baikal spring phytoplankton conformed to solar activity cycles	HYDROBIOLOGIA					3rd Symposium on Species in Ancient Lakes	SEP 02-07, 2002	Quincy, WA					The paper presents an analysis and discussion on a phenomenon of Lake Baikal spring phytoplankton known as `melosira years,' or high-productive years, which are years when spring a psychric set of planktonic algae intensively blooms in the interstitial water within the thawing ice and in the under-ice water. Alternative of these high- and low-productive years is one of greatest baikalian mysteries long attracting researchers' attention. Analysis of a sequence of high-productive years from 1943 to present, allowed us to reveal 11- and 10-year cycles in long-term dynamics of the Lake Baikal spring phytoplankton. Within these basic cycles we have found enclosed three intervals between high-productive years. Moreover, these intervals being usually 3 and 4 years long became doubled, i.e., 6 and 8 years long, from 1968 to 1990 that equals 22 years in length, or two 11-year fragments. This phenomenon of doubling can be explained in terms of the resonance theory so we consider the `melosira years' phenomenon to be bound up with solar activity, resonantly influencing baikalian phytoplankton. Also we found that Lake Baikal spring phytoplankton skip between their 11- and 10-year cycles in conforming to a current solar activity length.

The results from water transparency, chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus concentrations, calanoid to cyclopoid copepods ratio and zooplankton abundance confirm the different trophic state of both studied reservoirs: mesotrophic-eutrophic (Maranhao) and oligotrophic-mesotrophic (Santa Luzia), as previous studies have reported. Using Copidodiaptomus numidicus to compare both studied reservoirs, We found higher egg production rates in Maranhao than in Santa Luzia. Nevertheless, no relationship was ever found between zooplankton (abundance or egg production rate) and environmental variables (temperature and chlorophyll-a), which may suggest that wide and complex range of factors. abiotic its much as biotic, are involved in zooplankton dynamics during the circulation period.

The more eutrophic basins (Lugano and Iseo) showed a higher presence of cyanobacteria, green algae (Chlorophyta and Charophyta) and dinoflagellates (Dinophyta). Besides these two water bodies, high biomasses of cyanobacteria were recorded also in the oligo-mesotrophic Lake Garda. The development of these algal groups during the growing season showed a strong dependence on the surface spring availability of SRP, which, in turn, was related to winter climatic oscillations, deep mixing dynamics, and trophic status. A specific analysis carried out by applying additive mixed modelling, generalized least squares and mixed modelling, allowed investigation of the direct, seasonal effects of water temperature variations and trophic status on different algal groups. The dominant cyanobacteria (Oscillatoriales) showed only a partial relationship with temperature, while Nostocales and Chroococcales, which did not appear to have a close relationship with the trophic status of the lakes, were characterised by abrupt increases during the warmer months. High positive relationships with temperature were found for a few other algal groups (e.g., Chlorophyta, Charophyta and Dinophyta). Overall, the results indicated a positive relationship between the seasonal development of the more abundant and eutrophic-sensitive algal groups and the concurrent effect of trophic status and water temperature. Nevertheless, it was stressed that specific differences could be interpreted taking into account the different autoecological characteristics and susceptibilities of different species and functional groups to other stressing factors favouring losses, including, e.g., vertical sinking and grazing.

J	EVANS, TJ; HARRIS, SW				EVANS, TJ; HARRIS, SW			STATUS AND HABITAT USE BY AMERICAN AVOCETS WINTERING AT HUMBOLDT BAY, CALIFORNIA	CONDOR												The wintering avocet (Recurvirostra americana) population at Humboldt Bay, California averaged 706 +/- 35.6 (n = 30) and 567 +/- 67.0 (n = 30) birds from October to May, 1982-1983 and 1983-1984 respectively. Avocets arrived from late-August to mid-November. Birds departed from February to late-April and early-May. Avocets are recorded only casually at other northern California coastal sites. After construction of sewage oxidation ponds at the northeast comer of North Humboldt Bay in 1957, the number of avocets wintering at Humboldt Bay increased. The present wintering population of avocets at Humboldt Bay has increased from 30-35 in 1960 to 500-800 at present. Humboldt Bay probably has the capability to support a larger wintering population than presently exists. Avocets used 868 ha in the northeast comer of North Humboldt Bay, California. Within this area, which covered approximately 25% of available habitat in North Bay, the four major habitats used were: (1) intertidal mud flats, used mainly for feeding and resting; (2) a sewage oxidation pond, used mainly for feeding and secondarily, as a source of fresh water; (3) a section of the North Bay's highest elevation mud flats, used as an early high tide roost; and (4) islands in a brackish 6.9 ha lake adjacent to the North Bay, used as the primary high tide roost. Avocets typically roosted on shallow, submerged bars of islands in deep non-tidal ponds or in shallow water or exposed mud near the water's edge of tidal mud flats. Islands adjacent to deep, non-tidal ponds were used most frequently as roosting sites. Avocets fed at the oxidation ponds mainly in October when high concentrations of invertebrate prey, especially Daphne magna, were present. All other foraging took place on intertidal mud flats within 3 km of roosts. Avocets primarily fed using tactile methods in the wettest substrates. They usually fed within 100 m of the tide edge, and most foraging took place when tide levels were between 0.5 and 1.2 m Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW).																			0010-5422	1938-5129				FEB	1994	96	1					178	189		10.2307/1369075	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1369075													WOS:A1994MZ18900018

FACTORS AFFECTING LIPID RESERVES AND FORAGING ACTIVITY OF BUFFLEHEADS, COMMON GOLDENEYES, AND LONG-TAILED DUCKS DURING WINTER AT LAKE ONTARIO	CONDOR												To identify factors potentially limiting the abundance of ducks at the northern latitude of Lake Ontario, we investigated whether the lipid levels and foraging behavior of sea ducks wintering there were best explained by endogenous or exogenous mechanisms. We used an information-theoretic approach to evaluate if date (14 December-15 March; endogenous mechanism), percentage ice cover of Lake Ontario (long-term exogenous mechanism), short-term ambient temperature (exogenous mechanism), or some combination of these factors best explained variation in lipid reserves and foraging effort of the Bufflehead (Bucephala albeola), Common Goldeneye (B. clangula), and Long-tailed Duck (Clangula hyemalis). In the Long-tailed Duck, date explained lipid declines best, whereas in the Bufflehead and Common Goldeneye lipid reserves varied negatively with percentage ice cover. Conditions at our study site appeared to necessitate foraging because all species foraged, on average, >= 69% of daylight hours, and they increased foraging through the winter and when temperatures decreased. We calculated the number of days until lipid reserves should reach zero (i.e., fasting potential). Fasting potential differed in December, when Buffleheads (11 fasting days) had proportionately more lipid than did Common Goldeneyes (8 days) and Long-tailed Ducks (5 days). By March, the fasting potentials of the three species were similar (4 days), suggesting their survival strategies during similar winter conditions differed. Spatial and temporal modeling of temperature and ice cover with sea duck abundance at Lake Ontario and other Great Lakes may clarify factors that limit sea duck use of the region during winter.

Two peaks were observed for the chlorophyll a concentration, one in September 2009 and another in January 2010. The highest phytoplankton lysis rates observed in October were associated with the decay of the summer bloom, whereas the minimum lysis rates observed in January were associated with the winter bloom. The highest cell lysis rates in Meiliang Bay, Lake centre, and Gonghu Bay were 0.67, 0.77, and 0.68 d(-1), respectively, whereas the lowest lysis rates in these regions were 0.03, 0.01, and 0.05 d(-1), respectively. Water temperature showed an apparent indirect effect on lysis rate. In addition, a significant inverse relationship was observed between lysis rates and nitrate concentration in the three lake regions, which suggests that phytoplankton cell lysis is associated with changes in nitrate concentration.

Temporarily summer-stratified lakes are common: profile data from 436 lakes in lowland Denmark	INLAND WATERS												Lakes that undergo temporary stratification in summer do not fit into the classic categorisation of polymictic or dimictic lakes, but how common are they and what are the effects of stratification on the development of anoxia? We used monthly and bimonthly (twice per month) temperature and oxygen profile data from 436 Danish lakes (area range 1-3954 ha, maximum depth range 1.3-45 m) and defined a stratification indicator based on the temperature difference between the upper and lower 2 m of the water column. The stratification indicator had values between -1.6 and 17.7 & DEG;C and was significantly and strongly related to lake maximum depth and significantly but less strongly related to lake area. The indicator was highly variable, especially in lakes with maximum depths between 4 and 10 m, where intermediate indicator values suggest one or several mixing events during summer. The dissolved oxygen concentration in summer at the bottom was often <1 mg/L, even when the difference between top and bottom temperature was as low as 0.5-1.0 & DEG;C. Temporarily stratifying lakes with frequent mixing events over the summer are probably common in temperate lowland areas but are easily overlooked in routine monitoring programs. Temporary stratification has pronounced implications for the oxygen concentrations and potentially also for the biota and interactions between sediment and water.					; Søndergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019; Sondergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019; Davidson, Thomas/C-6542-2011	Johansson, lsjau2000/0000-0003-0770-1451; Davidson, Thomas/0000-0003-2326-1564; Nielsen, Anders/0000-0002-5885-4100; Sondergaard, Martin/0000-0002-1514-0482; 													2044-2041	2044-205X				APR 3	2023	13	2					153	166		10.1080/20442041.2023.2203060	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2023.2203060		JUL 2023											WOS:001025506600001

Secchi depth is still occasionally over 40 m at Lake Tahoe, but mean annual Secchi depth has declined nearly 10 m since 1967, prompting a large-scale restoration program. Year-to-year variability is extremely high, obscuring restoration actions and compliance with water quality standards. The model focused on Secchi depth during summer, when the lake is least transparent and most heavily used. Interannual variability for the summer season is driven largely by precipitation differences. The model offers a means for determining compliance with water quality standards when precipitation anomalies may persist for years. As demonstrated by means of an ex-post forecast, increasing Secchi depths during 1999-2001 were simply climate-driven and do not represent a recovery of the lake. The long-term trend for summer is most likely due to the accumulation of allochthonous mineral suspensoids.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				DEC	2003	60	12					1452	1461		10.1139/F03-127	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F03-127													WOS:000188752800004

Thus, we studied the effects of human disturbance on parental care by marsh harriers (Circus aeruginosus) in spring 1991 at Dos Reinos Lake, Ebro Valley, Spain. Specifically, we assessed changes in reproductive activities and nutritional condition of nestlings due to low-level human disturbance during incubation and nestling phases. The number of food items delivered and the time spent by males and females in the nesting area and on the nest decreased during disturbed periods, especially during incubation (P < 0.001), whereas behaviors related to stress (alarm calls, chases against other intruding birds, and percentage flying time) increased (P < 0.001). Although annual productivity of the disturbed pairs was not affected, nestlings of disturbed birds exhibited levels of blood urea that were higher (P < 0.001) than those of undisturbed pairs. Thus, minor human disturbances may cause long-term effects on lifetime reproductive success of birds by increasing energy and time expenditure in non-reproductive activities and by reducing condition of nestlings.																			0022-541X					JUL	1993	57	3					602	608		10.2307/3809289	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3809289													WOS:A1993LN19900023

Travertines as hydrologic archives: The case of the Pontecagnano deposits (southern Italy)	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES					Workshop on New Frontiers of Hydrology	2005	Princeton, NJ					Spring waters (17 degrees C), rich in HCO3--Mg2+ flowing along artificial channels, precipitate carbonate incrustations at Pontecagnano (Salerno, southern Italy). The incrustations have been analysed and monitored for two years and compared them with fossil incrustations (travertines). In the present-day precipitates, the delta(18) 0 and delta C-13 values suggest seasonal variations and inorganic CO2 origin, respectively. In the fossil travertines, three main environments have been identified and described: slope, shallow-lake and rapid-waterfall. Their interplay resulted in a progradational and aggradational travertine growth, recording recurrent interruptions due to lowering of groundwater levels and decrease in spring-water outflow. Isotope analyses, from different lithologies, suggest analogy of fossil accumulations with present-day incrustations also documenting seasonal changes. These data indicate that the present-day carbonate waters and travertines are responsive to regional hydrologic-climatic variations and that their fossil equivalents can be used to outline patterns of depositional processes and related climatic constraints for tens of thousands of years.

A total of 95 lake sturgeon implanted with radio transmitters were tracked using multiple stationary receivers augmented with boat-based manual surveillance during peak movement times. Both rivers were used by lake sturgeon during the open water ("ice off") season. In general, spawning sturgeon moved to the first insuperable barrier (i.e., natural rapids) during the spawning season, and then moved downstream to deeper pools in mid- to late summer. Non-spawning sturgeon moved into the river concurrently but remained in lower portions of the river. Lake sturgeon emigrated from the Pic River and resided in Lake Superior during the winter season whereas a small portion of radio transmittered sturgeon, originally sampled in the Pic River, overwintered in the White River. River discharge and the interaction between discharge and water temperature were correlated with upstream movement, and river discharge was also correlated with outmigration. No genetic structuring was apparent between Sturgeon within the two rivers, consistent with telemetry data showing radio-tagged fish moving readily between the rivers. This study provided pertinent seasonal use information of unregulated Great Lake tributaries and may contribute to planning processes for future hydroelectric developments to minimize disruptions to lake Sturgeon populations.

However, the crucial factors that affect the seasonal succession and extent of dominance of different species remain largely unknown. This study investigated inorganic phosphorus (P) uptake, growth, and P utilization of two dominant Microcystis species from Lake Taihu (China) at different P concentrations and temperatures. Compared with Microcystis wesenbergii, Microcystis flos-aquae had higher maximum uptake rate and luxury storage coefficient. However, M. flos-aquae also had a higher P demand for growth. Under P-rich conditions (64.5 to 174.5 mu M), M. flos-aquae had a higher growth rate (0.16 to 0.21 d(-1)) than M. wesenbergii (0.06 to 0.19 d(-1)) at 22 to 30 A degrees C. M. wesenbergii, with higher phosphate affinity, had a lower P demand to sustain its growth, and yielded a higher growth rate of 0.10 d(-1) at low P concentration (6.5 mu M) at 34 A degrees C, whereas M. flos-aquae had a lower growth rate of 0.03 d(-1). Therefore, M. flos-aquae was dominant in late spring under P-rich conditions, whereas M. wesenbergii prevailed in hot summer after M. flos-aquae decreased under P-limited conditions. These results agree well with their succession patterns in the field. Overall, succession and dominance of M. flos-aquae and M. wesenbergii in Lake Taihu are regulated by P concentration and water temperature.																			0921-8971	1573-5176				FEB	2014	26	1					333	339		10.1007/s10811-013-0067-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-013-0067-7													WOS:000330969800037

M. 2013 (January): Catchment instability and Asian summer monsoon variability during the early Holocene in southwestern China. Boreas, Vol. 42, pp. 224-235. 10.1111/j.15023885.2012.00287.x. ISSN 0300-9483. A high-resolution palaeorecord (06SD) from Lake Shudu, Yunnan Province, southwestern China indicates a broad trend towards catchment stability, enhanced organic productivity and regional forest-cover expansion during the early to mid Holocene. These changes are congruent with a shift to warm, wet climatic conditions, probably driven by orbitally forced Asian summer monsoon strengthening. Intriguingly, however, during the very early Holocene (c. 10.7 to 10.1 cal. ka BP), there is a prominent reversal in this trend, suggesting a weakening Asian summer monsoon. The precise cause and extent of this event remain unclear but demonstrate the urgent need for more comprehensive dating of records from across the region to test for synchroneity and examine climatic forcing mechanisms.

J	Abril, G; Commarieu, MV; Guérin, F				Abril, Gwenael; Commarieu, Marc-Vincent; Guerin, Frederic			Enhanced methane oxidation in an estuarine turbidity maximum	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Methane and suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations, monitored bimonthly during one hydrological year (2003-2004) along 70 km transects in the tidal regions of the Garonne and Dordogne rivers (SW France), showed a significant negative correlation, both spatially and temporally. During spring in clear waters (SPM < 50 mg L-1), methane production was first evidenced by a net increase in methane concentrations, in parallel with temperature and a decrease in river flow. In summer, as soon as the estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) appeared and SPM concentrations exceeded 100 mg L-1, methane concentrations decreased from similar to 600 to similar to 30 nmol L-1 in one month. More downstream in the turbid Gironde estuary, methane concentrations were occasionally below atmospheric equilibrium. In dark microcosms, high methane consumption was observed in samples from the ETM with SPM concentrations > 2,000 mg L-1, but not after removing the SPM by settling (SPM = 16 mg L-1), nor in a sample collected few kilometers upstream, with SPM = 3 mg L-1. Methane oxidation was also able to draw down methane concentrations below half the atmospheric equilibrium value in an ETM sample. Suspended clays in the ETM enhance methane oxidation and strongly reduce methane fluxes to the atmosphere.

J	Afonina, EY; Tashlykova, NA				Afonina, E. Yu.; Tashlykova, N. A.			An analysis of interannual data on phytoplankton and zooplankton associations in fluctuating soda lakes	LIMNOLOGICA												Aquatic ecosystems in arid regions are important and unique habitats for aquatic wildlife and support species biodiversity. Endorheic soda lakes in Central Asia are subject to great fluctuations in its size depending on cli-matic conditions. Here we present research results covering the last 20 years, including the period from the maximum filling of the Torey lakes (Transbaikalia, Russia) to their aridification and the initial phase of their refilling. Barun-Torey and Zun-Torey lakes are the largest soda lakes in the arid zone with a large water surface area. A unique feature of lakes is the unstable hydrological regime. The reason for the water level change is the periodic filling and drying of lakes due to cyclic climatic changes in humidity and temperature. We aim to determine the response of the plankton communities to environmental change in the Torey lakes over this period. We analysed the interannual variations in phytoplankton and zooplankton species richness, structure and den-sity. We conducted our studies during various phases of the hydrological cycle, including three periods for Zun-Torey Lake (high (1999 and 2003), intermediate (2007, 2011) and low (2014 and 2016) lake levels) and two periods for Barun-Torey (high water level (1999 and 2003) and the initial filling phase (2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, 2021)). Barun-Torey Lake dried up completely in summer 2009 and since 2013 the initial refilling has been observed. Zun-Torey Lake dried up in fall 2017. Changes in water level and water chemistry determined plankton biodiversity transformation. Fluctuations of plankton communities were different for each lake and conformed the phases of the hydrological cycle. We identified four stage changes in plankton associations during the ari-dification of Zun-Torey Lake, and three stage changes in plankton associations as the water level fell and through the initial refilling phase for Barun-Torey Lake.

J	Elron, E; Gasith, A; Goren, M				Elron, Eldad; Gasith, Avital; Goren, Menachem			Reproductive strategy of a small endemic cyprinid, the Yarqon bleak (Acanthobrama telavivensis), in a mediterranean-type stream	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												A mediterranean-type climate exists in five widely separated regions; the Mediterranean basin, parts of western North America, parts of western and southern Australia, southwestern South Africa and parts of central Chile. Streams in these regions feature seasonal disturbances of contrasting hydrology with high predictability of the timing of flooding and drying but low constancy. We would expect fish living in these streams to avoid scouring flow and breed after cessation of the flood period. The aim of the present study was to examine the adaptation of the Yarqon bleak, Acanthobrama telavivensis, an endemic cyprinid in the coastal streams of Israel, to mediterranean-type stream (mediterranean-written with a small m, is used in connection with climate or ecological region and is distinguished from Mediterranean that is used in a geographical context, referring to the Mediterranean basin.) conditions. For that we studied its reproductive strategy (age at maturity and life span, gonad activity, oocyte maturation, spawning activity and habitats, appearance of juveniles), in a major costal stream (Yarqon). Our findings show that the Yarqon bleak exhibits life history traits attuned with a mediterranean-climate hydrologic regime. It breeds in late winter and early spring, a window of opportunity between flash floods and habitat desiccation. Being a multiple spawner allows the fish to compensate for the potential loss of part of its reproductive output due to scouring flows of late floods. The ability of the Yarqon bleak to spawn on different substrate-types enables it to take advantage of different stream conditions that pertain in different years. The fish attains pre-adult size (ca. 33-42 mm) within the first year, prior to drying out of most stream reaches, and matures by the beginning of the second year (males > 41; females > 42 mm). The cost of these tactics is a short life span (4-5 age groups). The reproductive strategy of the Yarqon bleak falls into the category of in-channel breeding but, unlike the case suggested by a low flow recruitment model, the fish breed during the period of flood cessation, a transitional time between high and low flows, rather than at the time of low flow. Breeding at this time of the year in mediterranean-type streams puts early stages somewhat at risk of being washed away by late floods, but gains them a longer period of growth under favorable conditions. We suggest an additional positive tradeoff that should be investigated: the reduced competition with age 0 of other fish that breed later in the season. This suggested model of recruitment during the period of flood cessation seems appropriate for fish in streams with seasonal contrasting flows of high predictability but low constancy.

Characteristics and sources of N output were clarified by chemical statistics and isotopic abundance, and the contribution of N deposition to the N output was quantified by the output coefficient method. The N flux of wet deposition was estimated at 18.53 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), and originated mostly from agricultural activities. Watershed N was significantly accumulated from upper to lower reaches due to frequent human activities. Seasonal changes of riverine N were strongly affected by chemical fertilizer, with the highest concentration in spring and the lowest in winter. Nitrate was mainly derived from chemical fertilizer, accounting for 38.83% of all sources. N concentration in processes of different rainfall events had a hysteresis effect corresponding to the flow rate. Three rainfall events greatly changed DTN (Dissolved total N) outputs: rainstorm caused 91.26 kg DTN output, which was 11 times that of moderate rain (8.46 kg) and 4 times that of heavy rain (20.80 kg). N deposition contributed 19.89% of riverine N output in the watershed. The results can provide theoretical support for the control of N pollution in the TGR area.					; Li, Yanfeng/H-2856-2017	yan, kun/0000-0003-0721-2965; maofei, ni/0000-0002-4905-2739; Zhang, Liuyi/0000-0002-3939-8541													1672-6316	1993-0321				AUG	2022	19	8					2214	2225		10.1007/s11629-022-7427-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-022-7427-1		JUL 2022											WOS:000830011800003
B	Humphries, MO; Maker, J		Humphries, MO; Marker, J		Humphries, Mark Osborne; Maker, John			THE CHANGE IN FALKENHAYN'S PLANS	GERMANYS WESTERN FRONT: TRANSLATIONS FROM THE GERMAN OFFICIAL HISTORY OF THE GREAT WAR, VOL 2												FORTUNES SLOWLY CHANGED IN THE EAST DURING THE WINTER OF 1915. The joint operation in the Carpathians, which had caused so much controversy between OberOst and the OHL earlier in the month, was launched on 23 January. Conrad's plan called for the new Sudarmee to seize passes through the centre of the mountains while an Austro-Hungarian army did the same to the West and another struck the Russians in the East. The goal was to get beyond the peaks and relieve the besieged city of Przemysl. The battle conditions were unimaginable: rifles locked up in the cold, shells bounced off icy glaciers, and whole units froze in the mountain passes. It took more than a week for Sudarmee to reach its objectives for the first day. Although the Austro-Hungarian armies initially did better, the battle soon evolved into a series thrusts and retreats through frozen peaks and valleys. By the beginning of March, the offensive had already cost more than 800,000 Austro-Hungarian and German casualties. In March alone, Sudarmee lost two-thirds of its strength. On 22 January, Przemysl fell and 120,000 men trapped inside surrendered to the Russian Armies.(1) Meanwhile, the German Armies to the north met with more success as Ludendorff launched a separate attack in Eastern Prussia. On 7 February, General von Below's Eighth Army made a surprise assault in a blinding snowstorm and within a week had advanced more than 110 kilometres against the Russian Armies.(2) A second attack by the newly formed Tenth Army under General von Eichhorn led to the surrender of an entire Russian corps. Between 7 and 22 February the Germans captured 92,000 prisoners-including nine Russian generals, 295 guns, and 170 machine guns. In comparison, they lost only 120 officers and 5,600 men.(3) Thus in the winter of 1915, Falkenhayn faced an improved albeit still ominous strategic situation. While all fronts were more stable than they had been in December, the question of whether the war would be won in the East or in the West had yet to be settled. Ludendorff's offensive at the Masurian Lakes had achieved success, while Sudarmee's joint attack resulted in disaster. As Falkenhayn had warned, the Russians were battered but remained far from beaten while Austria-Hungary's situation grew worse. In what Norman Stone called "the Austro-Hungarian emergency" in the spring of 1915, the Dual Monarchy lost more than two-thirds of its August 1914 strength, was having difficulty replacing casualties, and could not supply its guns with ammunition.(1) The loyalty of ethnic minority groups in the army was also becoming increasingly questionable. The possible collapse of Germany's closest ally weighed heavily on the Chief of the German General Staff. At the same time, Serbia had yet to be defeated and a land connection to Turkey had not been secured. In the Mediterranean, Entente forces were poised to exploit Turkey's isolation with a naval attack in the Dardanelles. As at the beginning of the year, the attitudes of the neutral Balkan powers and Italy remained at the forefront of German strategic thinking. A Balkan Alliance against the Central Powers could now, more than ever, turn the war's tide against Vienna and Berlin. While storm clouds continued to gather in the East, in the West the German defences were holding. The French had failed to break through in the Champagne in January; the British had been rebuffed at Neuve Chapelle in March. When a late-winter proposal for the reorganization of the German Army promised to create a new strategic reserve, the question of its deployment took centre stage at the OHL. The decision would determine the emphasis of the war effort for the coming months and perhaps its final outcome.																					978-1-55458-259-4				2010							81	129																WOS:000288537900005
J	Renaut, RW; Jones, B				Renaut, RW; Jones, B			Controls on aragonite and calcite precipitation in hot spring travertines at Chemurkeu, Lake Bogoria, Kenya	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Subfossil travertines precipitated around hot spring orifices at Chemurkeu on the western shore of Lake Bogoria, Kenya, are composed of calcite, aragonite, and minor dolomite. Aragonite crystal beds, which form 5-10 % of the travertine by volume, are formed of large pseudohexagonal prisms, whereas the calcite crystal beds are composed mainly of feather dendrites. Dolomite is only found between aragonite crystals. Boundaries between aragonite and calcite crystals commonly display evidence of dissolution, but there is no evidence to indicate that calcite formed by inversion of aragonite or that the dolomite replaced the aragonite. Thus, the aragonite, calcite, and dolomite are each treated as primary precipitates. Reticulate gelatinous coatings, with a high Si and Mg content, cover most external and internal surfaces of the aragonite and calcite crystals. The travertines may have formed under more humid conditions than today, when the spring waters contained more Ca2+. The physiochemical conditions at the modern springs provide a context for interpreting the factors that controlled the precipitation of the aragonite and calcite. Today, the hot (T > 85 degrees C) Na-HCO3-Cl spring waters at Chemurkeu, which have a salinity of similar to 6 g.L-1 total dissolved solids, a pH of 8.1 - 9.1, and contain < 2 mg.L-1 of Ca2+ and < 0.7 mg.L-1 of Mg2+, are fed by a shallow aquifer (T approximate to 100 degrees C) and a deeper aquifer (T = 170 degrees C). Modern spring waters, derived from meteoric groundwater, lake water, and condensed steam, are fed mainly from the shallow thermal aquifer. Field, petrographic, and scanning electron microscope evidence obtained from the travertines, coupled with knowledge of the modern springs, indicates that the progressive and cyclic alternation from calcite precipitation to aragonite precipitation to aragonite dissolution which characterizes many travertine successions may have been caused by changes in P-CO2 of the spring waters under high temperatures (> 90 degrees C). The textures in the travertines show that precipitation of the aragonite and calcite crystals was probably abiotic, and episodic rather than continuous. Rapid degassing of CO2 associated with shallow boiling was probably a major factor in crystal growth.

J	Brand, C; Miserendino, ML				Brand, Cecilia; Laura Miserendino, Maria			Life cycle phenology, secondary production, and trophic guilds of caddisfly species in a lake-outlet stream of Patagonia	LIMNOLOGICA												Lake-outlets are transitional areas recognized as highly productive ecosystems in terms of density and biomass of aquatic insects. Life cycle, secondary production, trophic guilds and environmental constraints of caddisfly assemblages were investigated on a natural lake-outlet stream (Nant y Fall) in Patagonia, Argentina. We investigated the site monthly from May 2007 to April 2008 by recording environmental data and sampling caddis larvae using a Surber sampler at riffle areas (n = 36). Mastigoptila longicornuta, Smicridea annulicornis, Smicridea frequens, Brachysetodes quadrifidus and Parasericostoma ovale displayed well synchronized univoltine life cycles, while Neoatopsyche brevispina, Neopsilochorema tricarinatum, showed an asynchronous development pattern, although most of them had an extended recruitment, similar to those reported for non lake-outlet streams in the area. Annual secondary production per species varied from 8.22 (B. quadrifidus) to 3568.83 mg m(-2) y(-1) (P. ovale), with overall caddisfly production amounting to 4.8 g m(-2) y(-1). Shwredder/collector-filterer ratio was 3.3/1 suggesting that the system was detrital based. Redundancy analysis indicated that seasonally dynamic variables such as discharge, benthic particulate organic matter and temperature were the main predictors of seasonal caddisfly assemblage variation. We propose that the variety of food resources and the significant spatial heterogeneity at lake-outlet streams contribute to sustain a rich caddisfly community. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

Several fragments fell onto frozen surfaces of lakes and, thanks to weather radar data, were recovered days after the fall. The studied rock fragments show no or little signs of terrestrial weathering. Here, we present the initial results from an international consortium study to describe the fall, characterize the meteorite, and probe the collision history of Hamburg. About 1 kg of recovered meteorites was initially reported. Petrology, mineral chemistry, trace element and organic chemistry, and O and Cr isotopic compositions are characteristic of H4 chondrites. Cosmic ray exposure ages based on cosmogenic He-3, Ne-21, and Ar-38 are similar to 12 Ma, and roughly agree with each other. Noble gas data as well as the cosmogenic Be-10 concentration point to a small 40-60 cm diameter meteoroid. An 40Ar/39Ar age of 4532 +/- 24 Ma indicates no major impact event occurring later in its evolutionary history, consistent with data of other H4 chondrites. Microanalyses of phosphates with LA-ICPMS give an average Pb-Pb age of 4549 +/- 36 Ma. This is in good agreement with the average SIMS Pb-Pb phosphate age of 4535.3 +/- 9.5 Ma and U-Pb Concordia age of 4535 +/- 10 Ma. The weighted average age of 4541.6 +/- 9.5 Ma reflects the metamorphic phosphate crystallization age after parent body formation in the early solar system.

Climate as a driver of increasing algal production in Lake of theWoods, Ontario, Canada	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Lake of the Woods (LOW) is a large, transboundary lake that straddles the provinces of Ontario and Manitoba, and the state of Minnesota. Although algal blooms have been reported in the lake since the early 1800s, monitoring data and anecdotal evidence suggest that toxic, cyanobacterial blooms have increased in frequency and intensity in recent years. However, total phosphorus inputs from the lake's primary tributary, the Rainy River, have declined significantly since the late 1960s. We explore this disconnect by examining spectrally-inferred determinations of chlorophyll a (Chl-a) in lake sediment cores, as a measure of past changes in aquatic primary production. Beginning in the late 1970s to early 1980s, inferred Chl-a increased at 5 impact sites in the north end of LOW that currently experience cyanobacterial blooms in late summer and autumn. In contrast, no change in Chl-a was observed at an oligotrophic reference site with much lower cyanobacteria biomass. At the impact sites, Chl-a generally showed no significant relationship to long-term trends in diatom-inferred total phosphorus concentrations, but was significantly and positively correlated to climatic variables, including mean annual air temperature at all sites and total annual precipitation at 4 sites. These data suggest that climate change may exacerbate algal blooms in this moderately-enriched lake. The results also show that the effects of climate change on aquatic production may be enhanced at sites with higher nutrient concentrations, likely because of positive feedbacks between cyanobacteria biomass, water temperature and nutrient availability. The impact of climate change should be considered carefully in future management initiatives.

J	Ingebritsen, SE; Mariner, RH				Ingebritsen, S. E.; Mariner, R. H.			Hydrothermal heat discharge in the Cascade Range, northwestern United States	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Hydrothermal heat discharge in the Cascade Range includes the heat discharged by thermal springs, by "slightly thermal" springs that are only a few degrees warmer than ambient temperature, and by fumaroles. Thermal-spring heat discharge is calculated on the basis of chloride-flux measurements and geothermometer temperatures and totals similar to 240 MW in the U.S. part of the Cascade Range, excluding the transient post-1980 discharge at Mount St. Helens (similar to 80 MW as of 2004-5). Heat discharge from "slightly thermal" springs is based on the degree of geothermal warming (after correction for gravitational potential energy effects) and totals similar to 660 MW. Fumarolic heat discharge is calculated by a variety of indirect and direct methods and totals similar to 160 MW, excluding the transient mid-1970s discharge at Mount Baker (similar to 80 MW) and transient post-1980 discharge at Mount St. Helens (>230 MW as of 2005). Other than the pronounced transients at Mount St. Helens and Mount Baker, hydrothermal heat discharge in the Cascade Range appears to be fairly steady over a similar to 25-year period of measurement. Of the total of similar to 1050 MW of "steady" hydrothermal heat discharge identified in the U.S. part of the Cascade Range, less than 50 MW occurs north of latitude 45 degrees 15' N (similar to 0.1 MW per km arc length from 45 degrees 15' to 49 degrees N). Much greater rates of hydrothermal heat discharge south of 45 degrees 15'N (similar to 1.7 MW per km arc length from 40 degrees to 45 degrees 15'N) may reflect the influence of Basin and Range-style extensional tectonics (faulting) that impinges on the Cascades as far north as Mount Jefferson but is not evident farther north.

Response of the Cyanobacteria Plankton Community to Anthropogenic Impact in Small Lakes of Urbanized Territory in the Permafrost Zone of Northeast Asia (Eastern Siberia, Yakutia)	WATER												In the conditions of growing anthropogenic pressure, aquatic ecosystems all over the world are subject to transformation, expressed in the growth of eutrophication, increase in acidity, changes in water exchange, etc. In the region of Eastern Siberia we studied, located in Yakutia in the middle reaches of the Lena River basin, there is a significant population growth accompanied by advancements in agriculture and public utilities. The region is rich in small lakes, which have been under pressure from human activities for the past few decades. The studied region is located in the permafrost zone and is characterized by severe climatic conditions, cold long winters, short hot summers, and a short ice-free period on reservoirs. We studied 17 lakes of various genesis, with varying degrees of anthropogenic pressure, located in the largest city of the region, small villages, and at different distances from them. Previous studies have established that cyanobacteria constitute the phytoplankton main group in these lakes during the summer period. Therefore, we selected them as the focus for our bioindication analysis. An integrated assessment of the bioindication properties of cyanobacteria, along with chemical water parameters, was undertaken using statistical mapping methods, JASP, and Redundancy Analysis (RDA). This analysis revealed the impact of urbanized areas, characterized by a decrease in pH, runoff of nitrogen compounds, and an increase in organic matter. Despite the cryolithozone harsh conditions, in small lakes of urbanized areas, cyanobacteria exhibit their competitive advantages within the plankton community. The prospect of continuing our work is associated with the need to determine the risk of cyanoHAB development since potentially toxic cyanobacteria have a mass development in a number of lakes.					; Barinova, Sophia/AAH-6720-2019	Barinova, Sophia/0000-0001-9915-2503; 														2073-4441				OCT	2024	16	19							2834	10.3390/w16192834	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16192834													WOS:001332147600001

Black Carbon in the Air of the Baikal Region, (Russia): Sources and Spatiotemporal Variations	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												In recent years, the role of the atmosphere in the formation of the chemical composition of water in Lake Baikal and its tributaries has been increasing. In this regard, the study of equivalent black carbon (eBC) in the air above the lake and its coast has an important practical application. This paper presents the results of the mass concentration of eBC and submicron aerosol in the air above the water area of Lake Baikal, which were obtained during expeditions onboard research vessels in the summer of 2019 and 2023. We analyzed the data from the coastal monitoring station Listvyanka. To measure eBC, an MDA-02 aethalometer was used in the water area of the lake, and a BAC-10 aethalometer at the Listvyanka station. The background level of the eBC concentration in the air at different areas of the lake ranged between 0.15 and 0.3 mu g m-3. The results of the two expeditions revealed the influence of the coastal settlements and the air mass transport along the valleys of the lake's large tributaries on the five- to twentyfold growth of the eBC concentration in the near-water atmosphere. In the diurnal dynamics of eBC near settlements, we recorded high values in the evening and at night. In background areas, the diurnal dynamics were poorly manifested. In the summer of 2019, there were smoke plumes in the water area of Lake Baikal from distant wildfires and a local fire site on the east coast of the lake. The eBC concentration increased to 5-6 mu g m-3, which was 10 to 40 times higher than the background. The long-range transport of plumes from coal-fired thermal power plants in large cities of the region made the major contribution to the eBC concentration at << Listvyanka >> in winter, which data on aerosol, gas impurities, and meteorological parameters confirmed.

Two case histories	MICROCHIMICA ACTA												An empirical approach is presented for validating trace metal profiles in tree rings for use as environmental archives. Concentration profiles of Zn, Cd, Cu, Pb and U in tree rings and lake sediments are compared for assessing the reliability of the former as an environmental proxy. Laser ablation sampling in conjunction with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is used for the direct analysis of tree rings. An optimised analytical protocol is devised with particular emphasis on sample preparation and quantification strategy. Significant correlations in the two environmental archives were found for zinc, copper and uranium, while cadmium and lead temporal trends, although showing enrichment in recent years, do not agree with the concentration profiles in lacustrine sediment cores. A chemical model based on metal affinity for hard type ligands present in wood is proposed to explain these results. Moreover, spring and winter wood are analysed separately thanks to the high spatial resolution of laser ablation sampling. As a result, enhanced metal loadings are shown to lead to intraring differences in trace metal concentrations.

J	Gsell, TC; Ventullo, RM				Gsell, TC; Ventullo, RM			Estimation of nutrient limitation of bacterial activity in temperate alkaline fen sediments from Cedar Bog	OHIO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												Cedar Bog Nature Preserve, located near Urbana, OH, encompasses several wetland types including an alkaline fen. in this fen, groundwater emerges in quicksand-like discharge zones consisting of porous Ca/Mg carbonates mixed with organic detritus. This study evaluates seasonal changes in the heterotrophic sediment microbial communities, their response to nutrient amendment, and in the groundwater chemistry from a fen discharge zone at Cedar Bog. The hypothesis that the microbial community in this fen upwelling is nutrient limited throughout the year, particularly by C and P, was tested. The activity of the heterotrophic bacterial community in the sediment compartment was measured. A series of single factor experiments were conducted to study organic and inorganic nutrient regulation of these communities and to determine what nutrients, if any, were limiting. Activities were based on H-3-thymidine incorporation into DNA by control and nutrient amended sediment slurries and verified with C-14-leucine incorporation into protein. Bacterial cell abundance was determined using Acridine Orange direct counts. Samples amended with carbon showed significant increases in activity in three of four seasons tested. Bog extract also stimulated activity above that of the control for the winter microcosm. The site bacterial activity also appears to be limited by inorganic nitrogen and possibly phosphorus in summer.																			0030-0950					JUN	2004	104	3					43	50																WOS:000223795000002

Golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei) survival during winter at the northern invasion front implies a potential high-latitude distribution	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim: Golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei is an invasive bivalve in many freshwater ecosystems in Asia and South America. Cold winter temperatures are expected to restrict its spread to high-latitude areas. Cold tolerance and potential distribution of this species remain largely unstudied because the most extensively studied populations occur in tropical and sub-tropical areas. We sought to investigate cold tolerance of golden mussels and to model their potential distribution at higher latitudes. Location: China, Global. Methods: We investigated overwintering survival of caged golden mussels in a reservoir located at the northern invasion front in north China. We then determined the lowest water temperature at which mussel filtering occurred in laboratory. Finally, we modelled relative environmental suitability globally based on Maximum Entropy using the species' most updated occurrence records. Results: Golden mussels in a northern invasion front reservoir could survive over a course of 6 days at <1 degrees C, or 41 days at <2 degrees C, or 108 days at <5 degrees C, with 27% survival overall. Caged mussels were inaccessible to local predators and reproduced, with the subsequent population size increasing in early summer by similar to 280%, representing a potential source population. Laboratory tests demonstrated that the lowest water temperature at which mussels could filter water was 5.5 degrees C, and 50% of individuals became active when temperature rose to 7.5-8.0 degrees C. Species distribution modelling illustrated a potential distribution of golden mussels at higher latitude than presently found. Models that considered updated high-latitude occurrence records predicted a significantly larger suitable area than currently exists, including near the lower Laurentian Great Lakes. Main conclusions: Our findings suggest enhanced cold tolerance of golden mussels and wider potential distribution than currently exists. We emphasize the importance of examining samples from invasion fronts when developing distribution predictions for spreading invasive species.					macisaac, hugh/AAE-3742-2020; Zhan, Aibin/A-7240-2011	Xia, Zhiqiang/0000-0002-9201-1043; Barker, Justin/0000-0001-6363-1959													1366-9516	1472-4642				AUG	2021	27	8					1422	1434		10.1111/ddi.13289	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.13289		MAY 2021											WOS:000647190100001

To this purpose, 42 rain gauge and 25 hydrometric stations were selected in Lake Urmia basin during the statistical period of 1984-2013. The results of studying the precipitation changes in the LUB indicated that this basin experienced a combination of decreasing and increasing trend during the studied statistical period. The decreasing precipitation trend was often observed at west and southwest stations of the basin. The increasing trend was observed in the southern and northeastern regions. The results of studying the changes in river flow rate of the studied stations in the LUB indicated that the trend of river flow rate is decreasing in most of the months. At an annual scale, the decreasing trend of river flow rate was also clearly observed across the basin at all stations. In addition, the decreasing trend of river flow rate is more severe in autumn and winter. The results of studying the time of changing point in the precipitation series showed that the time of changing point occurred between 1992 and 1998 at most of the stations that experienced a decreasing precipitation trend. The time of changing point of river flow rate in LUB occurred between 1994 and 1998. Two years after the reductions in precipitation, the decreasing trend of river flow rate occurred in the rivers.					; Ramezani, Yousef/AAF-5196-2021; Ahmadi, Farshad/AAD-5052-2019; Nazeri Tahroudi, Mohammad/U-1803-2017	Ahmadi, Farshad/0000-0001-7387-0224; Nazeri Tahroudi, Mohammad/0000-0002-6871-2771													1866-7511	1866-7538				MAR	2019	12	6							219	10.1007/s12517-019-4373-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12517-019-4373-5													WOS:000461306900001

Biomass samples were collected in the Czech Republic in February 2013 and analysed for concentration of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, fibre and lignin. With the help of a recent analogy from the Altai Mountains (Russia), possible consequences of winter grazing on the development of forest vegetation and cattle breeds in prehistory were assessed. Hedera and Viscum were the best forage available in winter, and their nutritive value, according to the highest N and lowest fibre and lignin concentrations, was higher than the nutritive value of all winter-collected annual twigs of woody species. Nutritive value of annual twigs of all woody species was very low, especially compared with the quality of meadow hay, leaf-fodder or senescent steppe grassland biomass. Therefore, Hedera and Viscum might have been preferentially grazed by livestock and collected by ancient farmers for the supplementary feeding of privileged animals. According to recent analogy, annual twigs of woody species were browsed by livestock. Their insufficient quality could be one of the reasons for the low body size of cattle recorded in prehistory. The most realistic model of livestock breeding in prehistory seems to be year-round grazing, opening forests and causing deforestation in the surroundings of prehistoric settlements.					; Hejcmanová, Pavla/AAD-4910-2021	Hejcman, Michal/0000-0002-3513-2017; Hejcmanova, Pavla/0000-0001-9547-4302; Pavlu, Vilem/0000-0003-1682-9975													0959-6836	1477-0911				JUN	2014	24	6					659	667		10.1177/0959683614526904	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683614526904													WOS:000337573000003

Shallow ponds are heterogeneous habitats within a temperate salt marsh ecosystem	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Integrating spatial heterogeneity into assessments of salt marsh biogeochemistry is becoming increasingly important because disturbances that reduce plant productivity and soil drainage may contribute to an expansion of shallow ponds. These permanently inundated and sometimes prominent landscape features can exist for decades, yet little is known about pond biogeochemistry or their role in marsh ecosystem functioning. We characterized three ponds in a temperate salt marsh (MA, USA) over alternating periods of tidal isolation and flushing, during summer and fall, by evaluating the composition of plant communities and organic matter pools and measuring surface water oxygen, temperature, and conductivity. The ponds were located in the high marsh and had similar depths, temperatures, and salinities. Despite this, they had different levels of suspended particulate, dissolved, and sediment organic matter and abundances of phytoplankton, macroalgae, and Ruppia maritima. Differences in plant communities were reflected in pond metabolism rates, which ranged from autotrophic to heterotrophic. Integrating ponds into landcover-based estimates of marsh metabolism resulted in slower rates of net production (-8.1 +/- 0.3 to -15.7 +/- 0.9%) and respiration (-2.9 +/- 0.5 to -10.0 +/- 0.4%), compared to rates based on emergent grasses alone. Seasonality had a greater effect on pond water chemistry, organic matter pools, and algal abundances than tidal connectivity. Alternating stretches of tidal isolation and flushing did not affect pond salinities or algal communities, suggesting that exchange between ponds and nearby creeks was limited. Overall, we found that ponds are heterogeneous habitats and future expansion could reduce landscape connectivity and the ability of marshes to capture and store carbon.					; Mariotti, Giulio/AAH-3544-2020; Sylva, Sean/D-4400-2014	Howard, Evan/0000-0002-1993-0692; Spivak, Amanda/0000-0001-6743-0783; Forbrich, Inke/0000-0002-0632-7317													2169-8953	2169-8961				JUN	2017	122	6					1371	1384		10.1002/2017JG003780	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JG003780													WOS:000406520900005

Yet, past approaches centred on a growing use of fertilizers, pesticides, fuel and water are not likely to achieve the required 30-50% additional increases in food production by mid-century. We show that efficiencies of production are falling and the costs of environmental harm are increasing. Agricultural innovations that improve natural capital are urgently needed. Conservation agriculture (CA) is now practised on >8Mha in China and is offering promising prospects of both enhanced yields and environmental services. Our meta-analysis of 60 papers with 395 observations in China shows notable benefits from CA. Mean yield increase was 4.5% or 263kgha(-1) for wheat, 8.3% or 424kgha(-1) for maize, and 1.65% or 250kgha(-1) for rice. In 34 datasets from 22 published papers (experimental duration: 2-17 years), 26 datasets (76.5%) show that CA increased yield and soil organic carbon (mean SOC increase of >3g.kg(-1) in 0-10cm soil depth) when compared with traditional tillage. Key priorities for the spread of more sustainable forms of agriculture in China are national policy and financial support, better coordination across agencies, and better extension for farmers.

J	Joynt, EH III; Wolfe, AP				Joynt, EH III; Wolfe, AP			Paleoenvironmental inference models from sediment diatom assemblages in Baffin Island lakes (Nunavut, Canada) and reconstruction of summer water temperature	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Diatoms from the surface sediments of 61 lakes on Baffin Island, Nunavut, were identified, enumerated, and interpreted quantitatively. The samples span a latitudinal transect from 62 to 74 degreesN, reflecting climatic and vegetational gradients that range from low Arctic to transitional mid-Arctic to high Arctic. While the sampled lakes encompass both predominantly maritime and continental climatic regimes, sites have been deliberately restricted to basins in Precambrian crystalline terrain to mitigate the edaphic consequences of alkaline sedimentary bedrock. Canonical correspondence analysis, using forward selection and Monte Carlo permutation tests, identified pH, conductivity, summer lake water temperature, and mean annual air temperature as significant environmental controls over diatom assemblages. Using weighted-averaging regression and calibration, predictive models for these parameters have been developed. When applied to down-core assemblages, the summer lake water temperature model provides realistic reconstructions when compared with other paleoenvironmental records. Over the past 5000 years, the amplitude of reconstructed summer lake water temperature is on the order of 4.0 degreesC, expressed primarily as progressive Neoglacial cooling culminating in the Little Ice Age. Diatom-inferred summer water temperatures have increased by 2.0 degreesC in the past 150 years, again in agreement with independent paleoclimatic reconstructions.

Muskellunge are an upper trophic level predator, and therefore a naturally low-density species. Limited fishery-independent data exist on which to base management decisions. To remedy this, we initiated an acoustic telemetry study in May of 2016, in collaboration with the Great Lakes Acoustic Telemetry Observation System. Our objective was to describe patterns of movement of muskellunge in this large and open system to better understand their spatial ecology. We acoustically tagged 133 muskellunge in the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair, and movements of 58 fish that passed our data quality control screens were analyzed. We utilized mixed modelling to assess the effects of sex, length, release location, and season on daily movement rates. We found that movement rates only differed among seasons, with highest movement rates occurring in the fall and lowest movement rates in the winter. Muskellunge tagged at different locations exhibited distinct residency patterns, and fish frequently crossed jurisdictional and waterbody boundaries. Ultimately our study highlights the scope and patterns of muskellunge movement in a large, unimpounded system and demonstrates that management of these fish would benefit from consideration of their full distribution covering multiple management jurisdictions.

This study was conducted in 2006 and 2007 to establish the amount of N accumulated in corn and winter wheat over the entire growing season. Plots representing three N fertilization rates 0, 45, and 90 kg ha-1 at Stillwater and 0, 67, and 112 kg ha-1 at Lahoma were selected from two long-term wheat experiments located at research stations in Stillwater and Lahoma, Oklahoma. For corn, three N fertilization rates 0, 112 and 224 kg ha-1 at Lake Carl Blackwell and 0, 56 and 112 kg ha-1 at Perkins were selected from N studies, located at research stations near Lake Carl Blackwell and Perkins, Oklahoma. Sequential aboveground biomass samples were collected from 1 m2 area of wheat and 1.5 m long row (0.76 cm spacing) for corn throughout their respective growing seasons. In general, this work showed that more than 45% of the maximum total N accumulated could be found in corn plants by growth stage V8 (8th leaf collar fully unfolded). For winter wheat, more than 61% of the maximum total N accumulated at later stages of growth could be accounted for by Feekes growth stage 5 (F5, leaf strongly erected). Our findings are consistent with those of others showing that yield potential can be predicted at mid-season since such a large percentage of the total N accumulated was accounted for early on in the growing cycle of either wheat or corn.

During the 1992/1993 and 1994/1995 seasons, abiotic parameters and the structure and dynamics of the phytoplankton were studied. Algal assemblages from the phytoplankton, from algal clumps encased in the lake ice and from the benthic algal felt were compared. Low Jaccard similarity indices between these three assemblages suggest different survival strategies. The higher species richness of phytoplankton when studied during the whole summer also suggests that external propagule inputs can heavily influence the structure of this community. High levels of phosphate, nitrate and ammonium throughout the study periods indicate that they do not limit summer growth of the phytoplankton community. Blooms of Chlamydomonas subcaudata Wille are apparently characteristic. This group of features define Otero Lake as a highly eutrophic water body, in which outflow seems to be the main cause of phytoplankton loss during summer.

Water pH and temperature in Lake Biwa from MBT'/CBT indices during the last 280 000 years	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												We generated a 280 000 yr record of water pH and temperature in Lake Biwa, central Japan, by analysing the methylation index (MBT') and cyclisation ratio (CBT) of branched tetraethers in sediments from piston and bore-hole cores. Our aim was to understand the responses of precipitation and air temperature in central Japan to the East Asian monsoon variability on orbital timescales. Because the water pH in Lake Biwa is determined by phosphorus and alkali cation inputs, the record of water pH should indicate the changes in precipitation and temperature in central Japan. Comparison with a pollen assemblage in a Lake Biwa core suggests that lake water pH was determined by summer temperature in the low-eccentricity period before 55 ka, while it was determined by summer precipitation in the high-eccentricity period after 55 ka. From 130 to 55 ka, the variation in lake pH (summer precipitation) lagged behind that in summer temperature by several thousand years. This perspective is consistent with the conclusions of previous studies (Igarashi and Oba, 2006; Yamamoto, 2009), in that the temperature variation preceded the precipitation variation in central Japan.

Addition of as little as 1 mug.L-1 copper suppressed algal biomass, measured as particulate chlorophyll a, compared with control treatments, additions of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, or additions of carrier water alone. Suppression effects of copper, added alone or in combination with cadmium, lead, and thallium, were evident in inner and outer regions of Saginaw Bay during both spring and summer when phytoplankton communities were composed alternatively of diatoms and cyanobacteria. Experimental treatments were conducted in parallel with measurements of metal concentrations and metal complexation capacities of lake water collected by ultraclean trace metal techniques. Despite apparent overchelation of dissolved copper by organic ligands in Saginaw Bay, additions of a few tens of nanomoles of copper per litre strongly reduces algal biomass compared with control treatments. These results suggest that metal concentrations in some Great Lakes waters in equilibrium with natural chelators may be above the essential requirements and potentially at levels of incipient toxicity to the native phytoplankton communities.																			0706-652X					OCT	2004	61	10					1871	1880		10.1139/F04-129	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F04-129													WOS:000226595900007

Redistribution of radionuclides between a microbial mat and a carbonate body at the Garga hot spring (Baikal Rift Zone)	DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES												The features of present deposits that form in the vicinity of hot springs can provide clues to the parameters of paleowaters in places of past hydrothermal activity marked by remnant carbonate and/or siliceous sinter. We investigated a large carbonate body at the Garga hot spring developing in the Baikal zone of nitric hydrotherms in the Barguzin Rift Zone valley. The main focus was on the structure of the carbonate mound, as well as on the partitioning of radioactive elements between the cyanobacterial mat and the inorganic component of the body (the issue that has never been explored before). The cyanobacterial community of the Garga spring is an active biosorbent of Ra-226, Ra-228, Pb-210. The radionuclides accumulated by biosorption become preserved in minerals that form within the bacterial community. The reported data of mineral formation in the cyanobacterial mat along with the mineralogy and structure of the carbonate mound of the Garga spring have implications for the complex history of the Garga body. It has been produced jointly by precipitation from the venting thermal water (opal-calcite-fluorite-barite-celestine assemblage) and microbial metabolic activity (coarse calcite and thin black encrustation rich in Mn minerals).					; Bryanskaya, Alla/A-7058-2014; Petrova, Irina/I-6548-2015; Sergey, Zhmodik/O-2431-2013; Lazareva, Elena/O-2400-2013; Melgunov, Mikhail/A-3833-2014	Mel'gunov, Mihail/0000-0001-8220-7109; Bryanskaya, Alla/0000-0003-2966-5201; Lazareva, Elena/0000-0001-6617-3287; 													1028-334X	1531-8354				AUG	2011	439	2					1131	1137		10.1134/S1028334X11080174	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1028334X11080174													WOS:000294712800019

SPRING AS AN ELEMENT OF A SMALL HOMELAND IN THE TRADITION OF THE CIS-BAIKAL BURYATS: IMAGE, STATUS, FUNCTIONS	TOMSKII ZHURNAL LINGVISTICHESKIKH I ANTROPOLOGICHESKIKH ISSLEDOVANII-TOMSK JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS AND ANTHROPOLOGY												For the Buryats, the concept of the motherland is not abstract but filled with concrete content, the main components of which are the natural elements of the ancestral territory: an ancestral mountain, a river or lake, fields and meadows, forests, individual groves, trees, and stones. These objects also include springs. The relevance of the work arises from the insufficient research into the cult of water in the Buryat tradition in general and mineral springs in particular. The aim of the article is to examine the features of the existence of the water cult and the place of mineral springs in the tradition of the Cis-Baikal Buryats living north of Lake Baikal. The study's objectives included examining the image of water sources, their status, and their functions in the tradition of the Cis- Baikal Buryats. The sources of the study were historical and ethnographic, folklore materials, and materials from the author's field research. A comparative historical method was used in the study, which helps identify commonalities in understanding and appreciating natural phenomena in the culture of the Turkic-Mongolian peoples. The study suggests that the Cis-Baikal Buryats retained ideas about "living" water - the water of some springs and lakes was associated with it. However, the cult of healing springs, the Arshans, did not develop in the Cis- Baikal Buryat tradition for several reasons: 1. The generic status of a water source, which determines the relevance of ideas about the territorial boundaries of the effectiveness of its therapeutic effect. 2. Spring water acquired magical healing properties in the process of ritual transformation with the active participation of a shaman. Such water could cure any disease. In this regard, the classification of mineral springs according to their medicinal properties may not have been relevant. 3. Moreover, in Transbaikalia, much of the work on the popularization of arshans, including their discovery and the determination of the medicinal properties of water, was done by the Buddhist church, whose influence did not extend to Cis-Baikal					Sodnompilova, Marina/U-6512-2019														2307-6119						2025		1					129	139																WOS:001446229800011

Summer aridity in the United States: Response to mid-Holocene changes in insolation and sea surface temperature	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												We examine the response of summer precipitation to mid-Holocene insolation forcing and insolation-induced changes in sea surface temperature. Using a high-resolution nested climate modeling system, we find that mid-Holocene insolation forcing results in drier-than-present conditions over the central continental United States ( U. S.) and northern Rocky Mountains, as well as wetter-than-present conditions over the Atlantic seaboard and northwestern Great Plains. We find that changes in summer precipitation are dominated by changes in large-scale processes, with similar patterns of change in the global and nested models. We also find that insolation-induced changes in sea surface temperature do not change the basic pattern of precipitation response, primarily because the dynamical response is very similar with and without sea surface temperature changes. Notably, drier-than-present conditions over the central U. S. are associated with enhanced anticyclonic circulation aloft over the mid-continent and reduced low-level moisture content over the Gulf of Mexico and south-central U. S., while wetter-than-present conditions over the Atlantic seaboard are associated with enhanced low-level cyclonic circulation and elevated low-level moisture content. The simulated patterns of precipitation and soil moisture agree with proxy moisture records from most regions, indicating both that insolation was the strongest determinant of mid-Holocene summer aridity in the continental U. S. and that high-resolution nested climate modeling systems are able to capture the basic response of midlatitude warm-season aridity to changes in external climate forcing.

In 1.7 m(3) enclosures, the color (400-700 g Pt.m(-3)) of the mixture of pulp mill effluent and lake water remained similar for 4 months in darkness, whereas exposure to solar radiation resulted in 17- 42% bleaching of color. During the summer stratification of a humic lake, the color (160 g Pt.m(-3)) water remained similar to that found during spring turnover, but the color of epilimnion decreased 13%. The measured rates of photochemical bleaching of color by solar radiation could explain the decrease of epilimnetic color. Attenuation of photobleaching in the water column was similar to that of blue irradiance. Measured photobleaching was well described by a model based on quantum yields. The model revealed that visible solar radiation accounted for 29% of photobleaching at the surface and 66% in the whole water column. The results indicated that solar radiation, rather than plankton, bleached color of lake water and pulp mill effluents in surface strata.

This work aims to investigate the effects of climate change and regulation of floodgates and the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) on WLF and lake volume in Huayang Lakes during the past 52 years. The results revealed that precipitation is the dominant factor that leads to seasonal variation of lake levels, whereas regulation of floodgates and TGD are the key drivers of hydrology regime change in the past 20 years. Natural lake regime has higher water level when there is more precipitation and less lake volume. Floodgates and TGD regulations have changed this pattern since 2003, causing less difference in water level in spite of more precipitation and lake recession. Under the combined impacts of floodgates and TGD regulations, Huayang Lakes have experienced a prolonged outflow time since 2003 and the contribution rate caused by the floodgates and TGD regulations has increased by 19.90%. Additionally, the water level of Huayang Lakes decreased by approximately 0.3 similar to 0.5 m from September to November, but it showed no alteration from January to March in the past two decades. This indicated that floodgate regulations used for agricultural irrigation and fishery culture dominate the hydrology regime in winter and early spring. This study is beneficial for aquatic ecosystem protection in floodgate-controlled lakes under the circumstance of climate change and vigorous anthropology activities.

The whole year PM10 samples were collected during September 2007 and August 2008. The annual average concentration of PM10 in Lhasa was 51.8 +/- 42.5 mu g m(-3), lower than those of major Asian cities. Distinct seasonal patterns were observed in PM10 concentration, with higher concentrations in winter, and lower in summer. The mean elemental concentrations were generally comparable with other urban areas, but significantly higher than those from a remote site in TP (i.e., Nam Co). Crustal elements, including Na, Mg, Al, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V. Mn, Fe, As and Ba, had similar seasonal patterns in PM10, while other elements, such as Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Cd, had less distinct seasonal variations, suggesting more anthropogenic inputs of the latter group. The result of principle component analysis (PCA) on trace elements demonstrated that fugitive dusts, traffic emissions and waste incineration activities were probably the major sources of anthropogenic metals in the atmosphere at Lhasa. The Pb isotopic compositions revealed that the metal was mainly originated from nature background with a minor contribution from the cement factory. The data obtained in this study can be useful for making pollution control strategies in the city, and also valuable for trace element studies in other environmental medium, such as snow, ice core, and lake sediments in the TP region.

Dissolved loads in the river exhibit distinct seasonal variability in major cation ratios and Sr isotopes over the 1 year period, reflecting seasonal differences in relative inputs from various sources and weathering reactions in the catchment. Distinct geochemical signatures suggest that eolian dust may affect river water chemistry significantly, resulting in a twofold increase influx of dissolved loads during spring relative to winter. It is noticeable that both the lowest and the highest Sr-87/Sr-86 values of the Buha River waters occurred in the monsoon season, indicating a sensitive response of carbonate versus silicate weathering sources to hydrological forcing on a seasonal basis. A significant decrease in Na/cation, together with lower Sr isotope ratios, is consistent with a greater proportion of carbonate weathering relative to silicate weathering in the early monsoon season. High temperature and increased rainfall during the peak of the monsoon facilitate an increased proportion of ions derived from silicates, partly from groundwaters, to river water. In other seasons, elemental and 87Sr/86Sr ratios vary much less, indicating a constant ratio of silicate to carbonate weathering, consistent with limited variation in discharge. Our results highlight that in a semiarid region where climatic conditions vary seasonally, in addition to silicate and carbonate contributions, supply from eolian dust may also play a significant role in controlling seasonal variations in chemistry of river waters.

Recent ecological and biogeochemical changes in alpine lakes of Rocky Mountain National Park (Colorado, USA): a response to anthropogenic nitrogen deposition	GEOBIOLOGY												Dated sediment cores from five alpine lakes (>3200 m asl) in Rocky Mountain National Park (Colorado Front Range, USA) record near-synchronous stratigraphic changes that are believed to reflect ecological and biogeochemical responses to enhanced nitrogen deposition from anthropogenic sources. Changes in sediment proxies include progressive increases in the frequencies of mesotrophic planktonic diatom taxa and diatom concentrations, coupled with depletions of sediment delta N-15 and C : N values. These trends are especially pronounced since approximately 1950. The most conspicuous diatoms to expand in recent decades are Asterionella formosa and Fragilaria crotonensis. Down-core species changes are corroborated by a year-long sediment trap experiment from one of the lakes, which reveals high frequencies of these two taxa during autumn and winter months, the interval of peak annual limnetic [NO3-]. Although all lakes record recent changes, the amplitude of stratigraphic shifts is greater in lakes east of the Continental Divide relative to those on the western slope, implying that most nitrogen enrichment originates from urban, industrial and agricultural sources east of the Rocky Mountains. Deviations from natural trajectories of lake ontogeny are illustrated by canonical correspondence analysis, which constrains the diatom record as a response to changes in nitrogen biogeochemistry. These results indicate that modest rates of anthropogenic nitrogen deposition are fully capable of inducing directional biological and biogeochemical shifts in relatively pristine ecosystems.

Free ammonia levels are compared with national criteria set to protect fish from toxic effects. Nearly continuous contravention of the national chronic toxicity criteria for free ammonia for salmonid and nonsalmonid fish, at all depths, and infrequent contravention of the national acute toxicity criterion for nonsalmonids in the upper waters is documented. The occurrence of particularly high concentrations of free ammonia in the upper waters was associated with increases in pH, driven by high levels of algal growth. A major reduction in the concentration of total ammonia in the epilimnion of the lake will be necessary to remediate the lake's free ammonia problem. This will require a major reduction in the load presently received from the adjoining wastewater treatment plant. This remediation effort should be integrated with on-going programs, focusing on the lake's problem of excessive algal growth because of the impact of algal photosynthetic activity on levels of free and total ammonia in the lake.																			1047-7624					SEP-OCT	1990	62	6					771	779																WOS:A1990EX13100004

Abrupt shifts in the Indian summer monsoon during the last three millennia	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Changes in monsoon precipitation governed agricultural practices and production, health risks, competition and conflict level of preindustrial human societies in South Asia. To understand monsoon shifts and their implication to the South Asian societies, we produced a sub-decadal scale multiproxy record of monsoon variability from the Rewalsar lake, India encompassing the past similar to 3200 years. Our multi-proxy data from this lake indicate a long, strong Indian monsoon interval during similar to 1200 BCE to 450 AD with intermittent short-lived dry phases, the latter half is coinciding with the Roman Warm Period. A moderately wet summer monsoon characterizes the Medieval Climate Anomaly during similar to 950-1300 AD. The Rewalsar lake experienced hypertrophic conditions across the transition from the Medieval Climate Anomaly to the Little Ice Age (similar to 1250 to 1400 AD) marked by severe depletion in delta N-15 ratio (0 to -5 parts per thousand). The monsoon was weak during the Little Ice Age cold interval and has intensified during the past four centuries in the study region. We find an evidence of the coincidence between increased summer precipitation and economic boom in South Asia with flourishing dynasties during the last three millennia.

The current work investigated the sedimentation of microcystin-producing Microcystis spp. in three reservoirs from Central Spain during the summer and autumn of 2006 and 2007. We confirmed remarkable settling fluxes during and after blooms ranging 10(6)-10(9) cells m(-2)d(-1), which might represent 0.1%-7.6% of the organic matter settled. A comprehensive analysis of the Valmayor reservoir showed average Microcystis settling rates (0.04 d(-1)) and velocities (0.7 m d(-1)) that resembled toxin settling in the same reservoir and were above most reported elsewhere. M. aeruginosa settling rate was significantly higher than that of M. novacekii and M. flos-aquae. Despite the fact that colony sizes did not differ significantly in their average settling rates, we observed extremely high and low rates in large colonies (>5000 cells) and a greater influence of a drop in temperature on small colonies (<1000 cells). We found a 4-14 fold decrease in microcystin cell quota in settling Microcystis of the Cogotas and Valmayor reservoirs compared with pelagic populations, and the hypothetical causes of this are discussed. Our study provides novel data on Microcystis settling patterns in Mediterranean Europe and highlights the need for including morphological, chemotypical and physiological criteria to address the sedimentation of complex Microcystis populations.					; Wörmer, Lars/ABH-5864-2020; Quesada, Antonio/L-2430-2013; Cires, Samuel/B-2508-2017; Cirés, Samuel/B-2508-2017; Wormer, Lars/ABH-5864-2020	Carrasco, David/0000-0002-0551-820X; Quesada, Antonio/0000-0002-8913-5993; Cires, Samuel/0000-0001-8272-5512; Wormer, Lars/0000-0002-3673-3826													2072-6651					MAY	2013	5	5					939	957		10.3390/toxins5050939	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxins5050939								23645154					WOS:000319438400006
J	Meyer, T; Wania, F				Meyer, Torsten; Wania, Frank			Organic contaminant amplification during snowmelt	WATER RESEARCH												The release of organic contaminants from melting snow poses risks to aquatic and terrestrial organisms and to humans who rely on drinking water and food production from regions that are seasonally snow-covered. Measured and model-predicted spring peak concentrations in waters receiving snowmelt motivate a thorough investigation of organic contaminant behaviour during melting. on the basis of the current understanding of snow metamorphosis, snowmelt hydrology and chemical partitioning in snow, this critical review aims to provide a qualitative picture of the processes involved in the release of organic contaminants from a melting snowpack. The elution sequence of organic substances during snowmelt is strongly dependent on their environmental partitioning properties and the physical properties of the snowpack. Water-soluble organic contaminants can be discharged in greatly elevated concentrations at an early stage of melting, while the bulk of the hydrophobic chemicals attached to particles is often released at the end of the melt period. Melting of a highly metamorphosed and deep snowpack promotes such shock load releases, whereas a shallow snow cover over a relatively warm ground experiencing irregular melting over the winter season is unlikely to generate notable peak releases of organic substances. Meltwater runoff over frozen ground directly transfers contaminant shock loads into receiving water bodies, while permeable soils buffer and dilute the contaminants. A more quantitative understanding of the behaviour of organic contaminants in varying snowmelt scenarios will depend on controlled laboratory studies combined with field investigations. Reliable numerical process descriptions will need to be developed to integrate water quality and contaminant fate models. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Therefore, the decadal variability of the Asian monsoon is crucial for predicting the medium- to long-term climate changes of the Asian monsoon region. The study of its evolutionary patterns and dynamic mechanisms is closely related to the needs of national medium- to long-term development decisions and the environmental, economic, and social development of the Asian monsoon region. It is also at the forefront of international climate research. By combining modern observations, climate reconstruction from proxy data (such as historical documents, tree rings, lake sediments, and stalagmites), and climate model simulation data, this paper reviews the characteristics of the decadal variability of the East Asian summer monsoon in different periods. This paper also summarizes the impact mechanisms of internal climate variability, such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV) and Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV), and external forcing factors, such as volcanic activity, solar radiation, and anthropogenic activities, on the decadal variability of the East Asian summer monsoon. First, we collected published high-resolution (>7 years) East Asian summer monsoon records based on historical documents, tree rings, and speleothem dat covering the past 2000 years, along with the latest climate simulation results for the past millennium. We then detrended the data and applied an 11-year low-pass filter, before using a multi-taper method (MTM) spectral analysis to examine their periodic characteristics. Both reconstruction and simulation results indicated that the East Asian summer monsoon over the past millennium has exhibited decadal characteristics with dominant periods of 20-30 years and 60-80 years, which is consistent with instrumental records of the past century. The periodic characteristics of historical documents, tree rings, and lake sediment records showed obvious spatial differences, reflecting the spatial variability of East Asian monsoon precipitation. However, the periodic characteristics of stalagmites in the entire East Asian monsoon region showed significant spatial consistency, reflecting the circulation characteristics of the East Asian summer monsoon with widespread consistency on a large scale. This periodic characteristic is consistent with the dominant periods of AMV and PDV, indicating the potential influence of AMV and PDV on the decadal variability of the East Asian summer monsoon. Finally, we discuss the driving mechanisms behind the decadal climate variability of the East Asian summer monsoon from both internal and external perspective. Modern meteorological analysis showed that AMV and PDV can affect the East Asian summer monsoon circulation and precipitation through atmospheric teleconnection wave patterns, influencing large-scale ocean-atmosphere coupling processes and modulating El Ni & ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation variability. Natural external forcing factors, such as volcanic activity and solar radiation, and anthropogenic external forcing factors, such as greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions, directly or indirectly influence the interdecadal variability of the East Asian summer monsoon by modulating internal climate system variability. However, the following key scientific questions remain to be answered: Which is more dominant between internal variability and external forcing? What are the specific mechanisms involved? How will the interdecadal variability of the East Asian summer monsoon and precipitation patterns change in the future under different climatic background conditions? Research on the decadal variability of the East Asian monsoon under different climatic background conditions, combined with numerical simulations, is expected to provide important references for a deeper understanding of these issues.

J	Wrzesinski, D; Graf, R				Wrzesinski, Dariusz; Graf, Renata			Temporal and spatial patterns of the river flow and water temperature relations in Poland	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY AND HYDROMECHANICS												Main aim of the study was to determine the temporal and spatial patterns of relations between monthly and annual average river flow (RF) and water temperature (WT) for 53 rivers in Poland. The research made use of monthly and annual WT and RF for 88 water gauges for the period 1971-2015. Correlations were established using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and the similarity of RF-WT relations was determined using the Ward's hierarchical grouping. It was demonstrated that correlations between average annual RF and WT were negative (for >85% of water gauges) and statistically significant (p<0.05) only for 30% of water gauges. It was confirmed that the studied RF-WT relations underwent seasonal changes. Positive correlations were clearly predominant in the winter months, while from April to September these relations were negative and statistically significant. The RF-WT relations were also characterized by spatial differences and this had been confirmed by separation of seven groups of water gauge profiles distinguished with the help of the Ward's hierarchical grouping method. The strongest RF-WT relations were apparent in the case of mountainous rivers, for which snow melt supply and summer rainfall supply were predominant, and lakeland rivers, which had a considerable share of groundwater supply. These were classified as cold rivers, as opposed to the cool rivers in the lowland belt, for which the RF-WT relations were the weakest. The results obtained may contribute to the elaboration of an appropriate management strategy for river ecosystems, which are assigned important economic and environmental functions.

Trophic coupling of the microbial and the classical food web in Lake Baikal, Siberia	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Pelagic copepods often couple the classical and microbial food webs by feeding on microzooplankton (e.g. ciliates) in oligotrophic aquatic systems, and this consumption can trigger trophic cascades within the microbial food web. Consumption of mixotrophic microzooplankton, which are both autotrophic and heterotrophic within the same individual, is of particular interest because of its influence on carbon transfer efficiency within aquatic food webs. In Lake Baikal, Siberia, it is unknown how carbon from a well-developed microbial food web present during summer stratification moves into higher trophic levels within the classical food web. We conducted in situ experiments in August 2015 to test the hypotheses that: (a) the lake's dominant endemic copepod (Epischura baikalensis), previously assumed to be an herbivore feeding on diatoms, connects the microbial and classical food webs by ingesting ciliates; and (b) this feeding initiates top-down effects within the microbial food web. Our results supported these hypotheses. E. baikalensis individuals consumed on average 101-161 ciliates per day, obtaining 96%-98% of their ingested carbon from ciliates and the remainder from small diatoms. Clearly, E. baikalensis is omnivorous, and it is probably channelling more primary production from both the microbial food web and the classical food web of Lake Baikal to higher trophic levels than any other pelagic consumer. Most ciliates consumed were a mixotrophic oligotrich and such taxa are often abundant in summer in other oligotrophic lakes. Consumption of these mixotrophs is likely to boost substantially the transfer efficiency of biomass to higher trophic levels with potential implications for fish production, but this has seldom been investigated in oligotrophic lakes. Feeding of E. baikalensis initiated a three-link predatory cascade which reduced the abundance of ciliates and elevated growth rates of heterotrophic nanoflagellates but did not affect abundance or growth rates of autotrophic picoplankton. This demonstration of a potential trophic cascade in Lake Baikal indicates that investigations at larger spatial-temporal scales are needed to identify the conditions promoting or precluding trophic cascades in this lake.

The autumn 10,430 BP case in Sweden	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Coastal seismic events generate instantaneous changes in relative sea level (i.e. land level vs sea level). Tsunamis may cause disastrous damage to coasts and coastal habitation. Liquefaction and deformations of annually varved sediments provide information on paleoseismic events. The evidence for a major earthquake and associated tsunami waves in Sweden are explored. Thanks to the varve chronology, liquefaction structures and varve deformations caused by this event can be dated at the autumn 10,430 varve years BP. The magnitude is estimated at 8 (or more) on the Richter scale. The tsunami washed the previously blocked outlet of the Baltic free of icebergs and pack-ice so that marine water could suddenly invade the entire Baltic, forming the Yoldia Sea.

All students face challenges in paying for their education, but SLCC students tend to have fewer resources to dedicate to school than students at other institutions in the state. While faculty and administrators have little control over the rising cost of tuition, they are able to offer students open educational resources (OER) to cut down on textbook costs. Salt Lake Community College's OER initiative was implemented in Summer 2014, and has since expanded to include 125 sections in Spring 2016. We examine OER's impact on three measures of student success: course grade, likelihood of passing, and likelihood of withdrawing. We use a multilevel modeling (MLM) approach in order to control for student, instructor, and course effects, and found no difference between courses using OER and traditional textbooks for continuing students. For new students, there is evidence that OER increases average grade. However, student-level differences such as demographic background and educational experience have a far greater impact on course grade and likelihood of passing or withdrawing than an instructor's use of an OER text. Future research should focus on longer-term impacts of OER on retention, completion, and transfer.																			1492-3831					JUN	2017	18	4			SI		35	49																WOS:000416439200004

The release site is a complex of two ponds comprising 6 ha of reeds and 6 ha of open water surface, with a water depth of 20-150 cm, and an artificial nesting site. Between 2000 and 2002, 35 adult pond turtles were released in three groups. During the activity season all individuals were radiotracked daily and during winter once per month. Individual home-range sizes and habits were recorded. The turtles adapted well to the new environment as indicated by the following observations: (i) most individuals stayed the whole year within the releasing site, although the ponds having been emptied in summer for management purposes; (ii) several turtles (mostly females) explored part of Lake Bourget (in 1-6 km distance from the releasing site); (iii) all dispersing individuals returned to the release point for overwintering; (iv) several females were observed excavating nests on the artificial nesting site, while others shifted to other habitats around the egg-laying site during the same period. Our results demonstrate high survival rates, fidelity to certain areas, habitat exploration, and nesting behaviour. This suggests that the prospects of the reintroduction programme are positive. However, other important parameters, like reproductive output, nesting and hatching success, and juvenile survival need to be investigated to determine the future development of the population.																			0006-3088	1336-9563					2004	59			14			155	159																WOS:000225944400023

Millennial scale and short-term variations of geochemical precipitates and grain size show that freshwater fluxes from the Tibetan Plateau by surface run-off were the main controlling factors for lake evolution in the Tibetan dry forelands for about the last 250 kyr. Periods of positive water balance with strong lake extension and reverse developments generally coincide with changes in the global ice volume and with oxygen-18 records from Tibet and Greenland as well, documenting the close relationship between environmental conditions in remote desert regions of NW China and orbitally forced Northern Hemisphere high mountain mid-latitude and high-latitude climates on a regional and global scale. Our data imply that both the East Asian summer monsoon and the extra-tropical westerlies are the major feedback mechanisms for effective moisture supply over NW China. During the 10-kyr long interglacial warm-moist substage 5.5, summer monsoon moisture dominated owing to its strong northward shift beyond the modern limit. At that time, a large and slightly saline lake filled the entire Gaxun Nur basin as a result of strong river inflow from the Tibetan catchment by melt water supply and by enhanced summer monsoon precipitation. Aeolian transport was weak. The Eemian interglacial in the Gaxun Nur region started at about 129 kyr, with warm and moist environmental conditions between 128 and 121 kyr BP and terminated around 119 kyr, documented by a strong climate shift towards dry conditions and enhanced mobilization of aeolian sand. During interstadial climates, contemporaneous with D/O events in Greenland ice cores, both wind systems most likely supplemented each other, while in transitional phases towards cold conditions, moisture supply by the westerlies seems to have dominated. Cold-dry stages, recorded in the Gaxun Nur core, are synchronous with the global climate. They induced strong lake-level declines and promoted aeolian transport of exposed lake sediments southwards due to the enhanced winter monsoon. Loess records from the Chinese Loess Plateau confirm that the temporal distribution of loess mobilization recorded in the Gaxun Nur sediments was synchronous with depositional phases on the Loess Plateau.					; Yang, Yingying/GRS-1048-2022	Hartmann, Kai/0000-0003-2540-6798; Hambach, Ulrich Friedrich/0000-0001-8455-6812; 													1571-0866		978-0-08-046806-8; 978-0-44-452955-8				2007	7						323	347		10.1016/S1571-0866(07)80047-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1571-0866(07)80047-9													WOS:000310639900023

Modern Records of the European Hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus, Erinaceidae, Eulipotyphla) in Southeastern Fennoscandia	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												Southeastern Fennoscandia, which encompasses the Republic of Karelia and the adjacent districts of Leningrad and Arkhangelsk oblasts, until lately remained an area of Russia's European North especially poorly studied as regards the status of the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus). Modern (2001-2022) records of this species obtained through the authors' original observations and based on reports received from respondents, altogether covering 212 hedgehogs and 182 encounters, are analyzed. The spatio-temporal patterns in the records of this species in the region are demonstrated; that is, there are an expanding distribution area and a growing frequency of encounters from northwest to southeast. The northernmost records are shown (64.368 degrees N, 30.383 degrees E), including yearlings (63.624 degrees-63.924 degrees N, 30.466 degrees-30.901 degrees E, northern taiga subzone), as well as the first reports of the species east of Lake Onega in both Karelia and Arkhangelsk oblast. Studies have revealed the habitat preferences and the rate of use of urban territories in the northern part of the distribution range: high shares of records come from deciduous (34.0% of the total number of animals reported) and mixed (19.3%) forest sites, as well as farmland (10.8%), second-home communities (16.5%), and rural settlements (9.0%). Hedgehog encounters in cut-over places, pine and spruce stands, wetlands, abandoned hamlets, and solitary buildings in the woods were few (0.5-6.1%). Most of the records were a result of accidental sightings by humans (80.8%), while domestic dogs spotted 19.2% of the hedgehogs. The earliest encounters in spring were recorded from April 25 to May 11, the latest sightings in autumn were from September 2 to September 17. The number of hedgehog encounters during their active life period was the lowest in April (1.1%), growing sharply in May and June (16.7 and 17.8%, respectively), peaking in July and August (30.0 and 24.4%), and falling sharply in September (10.0%). Some of the population parameters were determined: the average brood was 2.8 young of the year, the share of which amounted to 24.5% of the total number of records. Active single animals prevailed among adults (86.3%), and much smaller shares belonged to active pairs (7.6%) and females with litters (6.1%). The main cause of death was road killing by vehicles (77.4%). Climate warming and alterations in the forest structure may be reasons to expect further expansions of the area of hedgehog encounters, e.g., to transformed and urbanized boreal areas.

Here we have extended this analysis by using multiple regression models to test whether the recruitment series is influenced by density-independent factors. We chose population size with a lag of 1 year as the density-dependent factor; the density-independent factors were the summer water temperature with a lag of 2 years (temperature sum for June, July and August, indicating the year-class strength of predators) and the temperature-derived length of the larval period of vendace. For the years 1972-1990 the coefficient of determination (r2) of this regression model was 0.77. We suggest that the basic mechanism producing a persistent 2-year cycle of vendance in Lake Pyhajarvi is the asymmetrical food competition between age groups. The abundance of predators in the lake and the warming of the water after the hatching of larvae in spring together determine the final year-class strength of vendace.

At higher latitudes, fish consuming plant matter are exclusively omnivorous. We assess whether omnivorous fish readily shift to herbivory or whether animal prey is typically preferred. We address temperature as the key factor causing their absence at higher latitudes and discuss the potential poleward dispersion caused by climate changes. A controlled experiment illustrates that rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus) readily utilize plant matter at water temperatures above 20 degrees C and avoid its consumption below 20 degrees C. Field data support these results, showing that plant matter dominates rudd diets during the summer and is absent during the spring. Utilizing cellulose requires the enzyme cellulase, which is produced by microorganisms growing at temperatures of 15-42 degrees C. Water temperatures at higher latitudes do not reach 15 degrees C year-round; at our latitude of 50 degrees N similar to 150 days/year. Hence, the species richness of omnivorous fish decreases dramatically above 55 degrees latitude. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that strict herbivorous specialists have developed only in the tropics. Temperatures below 15 degrees C, even for a short time period, inactivate cellulase and cause diet limitations for omnivorous fish. However, we may expect increases in herbivory at higher latitudes caused by climate change.					; Smejkal, Marek/E-1269-2017; Blabolil, Petr/K-9548-2015; Frouzova, Jaroslava/F-8518-2014; Šmejkal, Marek/E-1269-2017; Vejříková, Ivana/E-1624-2017; Sajdlova, Zuzana/R-1383-2018; Vejrik, Lukas/E-1607-2017; Peterka, Jiří/C-7218-2014; Kiljunen, Mikko/B-5812-2009; Vasek, Mojmir/C-5839-2014; Cech, Martin/C-5797-2014; Vejřík, Lukáš/E-1607-2017; Vejrikova, Ivana/E-1624-2017	Peterka, Jiri/0000-0001-5935-4311; Smejkal, Marek/0000-0002-7887-6411; Blabolil, Petr/0000-0003-1344-9627; Vejrik, Lukas/0000-0001-8911-9128; Vasek, Mojmir/0000-0001-6386-4015; Cech, Martin/0000-0003-1350-4286; Vejrikova, Ivana/0000-0001-9113-2815													2045-2322					DEC 22	2016	6								39600	10.1038/srep39600	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep39600								28004804					WOS:000390267200001

The amount of phosphorus and nitrogen in the water depends on the internal load from the sediment as well as the external load. To estimate the effects of sediment load on the water quality of a reservoir, we applied a three-dimensional hydrodynamic and transport model based on the benthic chamber experimental results at Euiam Lake, South Korea. As shown in the sensitivity analysis results, the eutrophication period could be significantly extended by a change of phosphorus flux rates from the sediments. The increased phosphorus flux from the sediments intensifies the algal growth of Euiam Lake, which could cause serious algal bloom during spring and fall. This study provides information on nutrient concentrations in the sediment of Euiam Lake, verifies the role of the sediment as a source or sink of nutrients, and evaluates the effect of sediment release of nutrients and contaminants on water quality. This research is a useful tool in determining the effects of internal load in lakes and establishing the operation guideline for sediment management in order to maintain feasible water quality for beneficial use.																			2073-4441					JUL	2019	11	7							1409	10.3390/w11071409	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11071409													WOS:000480632300094

Recently metamorphosed juveniles were collected from streams, marked with coded wire tags, and returned to migrate to the Great Lakes. Juveniles already in the lakes and feeding on teleost hosts were obtained from incidental catches by sport or commercial fisheries. Sea lampreys in the Great Lakes spend only 1 feeding year as parasites, and marked animals were recaptured during the spawning runs. For one marked group in each of four parasitic cohorts (feeding years 1991 to 1994) and two marked groups in each of three cohorts (feeding years 1998 to 2000) we recovered from 1.1 to 10.2 percent of marked animals. The number of metamorphosed animals present in autumn before migration to Lake Huron was estimated for five cohorts, with estimates ranging from 639 to 803 thousand. The number of feeding, parasitic animals present in Lake Huron in mid summer was estimated for five cohorts, with estimates ranging from 515,000 to 2,342,000. The larger estimates later in the parasitic year suggested that animals collected and marked from sport or commercial fisheries did not survive at the same rate as unmarked animals. It is recommended that only estimates from recaptures of animals marked in the streams before migration be used until it can be established why survival of juveniles obtained from sport or commercial fisheries might be affected.																			0380-1330						2003	29			1			226	239		10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70491-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70491-2													WOS:000221321300018

The highest density of benthic organisms was found in an outlet of a lake, but drifting organisms were the most abundant in the small tributaries. Migrant parr that move to the small tributaries from the main stem have better food resources in their new habitat. Plecoptera nymphs were the most important prey for salmon parr early in the spring. Later in the summer dipterans were usually the dominant prey group. In September the importance of Plecoptera was emphasized in the small tributaries and the lake outlet, and that of Trichoptera in other sites. Drifting prey was used more by large than by small parr. The utilization of drifting food appeared to be related to the water temperature rather than to the availability of the drift.																			0906-6691					MAR	1998	7	1					13	24		10.1111/j.1600-0633.1998.tb00168.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.1998.tb00168.x													WOS:000072433300002

Connecting Breeding and Wintering Habitats of Migratory Piscivorous Birds: Implications for Tracking Contaminants (Hg) Using Multiple Stable Isotopes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Contaminant concentrations in migratory species are complicated by differential accumulation and elimination among geographically separated biomes. Double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) are used as monitors of Hg in North America; however, migration from northern breeding colonies to southern marine, freshwater, and aquaculture systems exposes individuals to spatiotemporal variations in contaminant uptake. We used stable isotopes (delta S-34, delta C-13, delta N-15, delta H-2) in primary feathers and a combined Bayesian assignment and isotopic threshold model to identify feather origins and the potential winter use of aquaculture (delta S-34 < 10 parts per thousand, delta C-13 > -14 parts per thousand), freshwater (delta S-34 < 10 parts per thousand, delta C-13 < -20 parts per thousand), and marine habitats (delta S-34 > 10 parts per thousand). This approach allowed us to contrast body burden Hg derived from the breeding and wintering grounds, as well as from marine and freshwater habitats. We found feathers grown on Lake Winnipeg had greater Hg concentrations (mean = 4.26 +/- 1.47 mu g/g fresh weight; n = 20) than winter-grown feathers (3.19 +/- 1.64 mu g/g; n = 19), but Hg in winter-grown feathers was not related to any specific habitat. Isotopic assays of tissues of migratory birds allowed the source and degree of contaminant exposure to be identified throughout the annual cycle.					; Wassenaar, Leonard/B-5996-2013; Hobson, Keith/Q-9306-2019	Wassenaar, Leonard/0000-0001-5532-0771; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				MAR 20	2012	46	6					3263	3272		10.1021/es204135s	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es204135s								22385064					WOS:000301630200030

Eutrophication and its key symptom, harmful cyanobacterial blooms, is expected to further increase in the future, which highlights the importance of managing the issue. The reduction of external nutrient load is crucial but might not bring fast relief to eutrophic waters due to ongoing diffuse pollution and legacy nutrients in the sediment. In this context, in-lake measures are needed to speed-up recovery. In this review, we discuss different in-lake measures based on coagulation and precipitation of cyanobacteria and/or phosphate for different lake categories (e.g., shallow or deep, mainly external or internal nutrient load, occurrence of perennial or summer blooms). In deep lakes with an external nutrient load higher than the internal load, a "Floc and Sink" method could be used in which a coagulant (e.g. aluminium salts, Al-salts; chitosan) combined with a ballast (e.g. soil, clay) removes a cyanobacterial bloom out of the water column. In case the deep lake suffers from high internal load, a phosphate (P)-fixative (e.g. lanthanum modified bentonite or Al-salts) can be used to "Lock" the legacy P, possibly combined with a coagulant - a "Floc and Lock" technique. The latter approach will target both the particulate P in a bloom and the internal P load. A shallow lake that suffers from summer blooms and in which the internal load is higher than the external load, a "Lock" strategy of winter application of a P-fixative is proposed to prevent bloom development. In shallow lakes with perennial blooms, an agent to damage the cells (such as H2O2) is required together with a coagulant and a ballast to avoid recolonization of the water column due to resuspension - a "Kill, Floc and Sink/ Lock" method. The selection of the most promising in-lake measures and materials should be based on a proper system diagnosis and tests prior to a full-scale intervention. These methods can be effective, but evidently reduction of external nutrient loads, both from pointand non-pointed sources, is an absolute necessity to restore aquatic ecosystems in a holistic sense.					; Marinho, Marcelo/C-1515-2013; Noyma, Natália/V-4708-2018; Miranda, Marcela/MTC-0768-2025; Miranda, Marcela/G-7811-2017; Huszar, Vera/J-7126-2012	Kang, Li/0000-0001-9937-9097; Huszar, Vera/0000-0002-8096-1404; Lurling, Miquel/0000-0001-6726-7904; Mucci, Maira/0000-0002-3896-2294; Miranda, Marcela/0000-0001-6994-8690; 													0925-8574	1872-6992				DEC 1	2020	158								106032	10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.106032	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.106032													WOS:000596365600002

Laboratory experiments were additionally performed to test the sensitivity of the phytoplankton community to nutrient concentrations and temperature. A phytoplankton community structure analysis from 1992 to 2012 showed that Cryptomonas (Cryptophyta) was the dominant genus in spring during the early 1990s. Dominance then shifted to Ulothrix (Chlorophyta) in 1996 and 1997. However, Cryptomonas again dominated in 1999, 2000, and 2002, with Ulothrix regaining dominance from 2003 to 2006. The bloom-forming cyanobacterial genus Microcystis dominated in 1995, 2001 and 2007-2012. The results of ordinations indicated that the nutrient concentration (as indicated by the trophic state index) was the most important factor affecting phytoplankton community succession during the past two decades. In the laboratory experiments, shifts in dominance among phytoplankton taxa occurred in all nutrient addition treatments. Results of both long term monitoring and experiment indicated that nutrients exert a stronger control than water temperature on phytoplankton communities during spring. Interactive effect of nutrients and water temperature was the next principal factor. Overall, phytoplankton community composition was mediated by nutrients concentrations, but this effect was strongly enhanced by elevated water temperatures.

The production of nonrepresentative TTGE profiles due to the generation of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) artifacts initially proved problematical. The use of a proofreading polymerase in the PCR was found to be essential and fully optimized protocols were established and tested to ensure confidence that the TTGE profiles truly reflected sequence diversity. TTGE analysis revealed the methanogen population to be less diverse in water than in sediment. The most genetic diversity was observed in TTGE profiles of sediment DNA isolated in winter and the least was in sediment DNA isolated in summer. DNA sequencing analysis of bands recovered from TTGE gels revealed the presence of two methanogen communities. One clustered with Methanosaeta species and the other with the Methanomicrobiales. Many sequences showed low DNA sequence similarity to known methanogens, suggesting that Priest Pot harbors previously undescribed methanogen species.

Are these zooplankton sufficient to meet the energy requirements of mysids? Could mysids remove a significant proportion of zooplankton production? Are the energy requirements in the two lakes similar? Comparisons in Lake Ontario of zooplankton consumption based on clearance rates, with energy requirements based on bioenergetic modelling, revealed that individual mysids, particularly larger ones, required additional energy sources. The denser mysid populations beyond 100 m depth in Lake Ontario could exert high mortality rates on metalimnetic zooplankton, remove a significant proportion of daily zooplankton production, and consequently, potentially compete with planktivorous fish. At depths <100 m, the mysid population was smaller and could remove only 6-19% of zooplankton production per day in summer when competition with planktivorous fish would be maximal. Generation time is shorter in Lake Michigan because winter growth rates remain high. Consequently, less energy is required to complete a generation in Lake Michigan than in Lake Ontario.																			0706-652X					NOV	1994	51	11					2591	2602		10.1139/f94-259	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f94-259													WOS:A1994QY71700021

Impacts of climate warming on Alpine lake biota over the past decade	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Alpine temperatures have risen at twice the rate compared to the northern-hemispheric average during the past century. This can be expected to affect Alpine lake ecosystems via, for example, intensified thermal stratification, shorter ice cover periods, and altered catchment processes. Our study assesses changes in some main constituents of the plank tic and benthic communities of five mid-Alpine lakes in the Niedere Tauern region in Austria in relation to climatic warming, by comparing community and environmental data from 1998-1999 to data from 2010-2011. Although lake chemistry remained relatively stable between the study periods, we observed an increase in lake water temperatures and a decrease in ice cover durations. Several of the dominant diatom species and chrysophyte cyst types show relatively clear changes; the responses of the whole communities, however, are less evident. Yet, in particular, diatoms show distinct assemblage changes along the climatic gradients in the two lakes with the largest decrease in ice-cover duration. Chironomid communities appear to be less sensitive compared to diatoms and chrysophyte cysts, which are known for reacting quickly to changes in their environment. Finally, Alpine lakes, which are moderately nutrient-enriched because of human activities in the catchment area, are likely to experience increases in their productivity with climate warming.

Temporal constraints on the potential role of fry odors as cues of past reproductive success for spawning lake trout	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Deciding where to reproduce is a major challenge for most animals. Many select habitats based upon cues of successful reproduction by conspecifics, such as the presence of offspring from past reproductive events. For example, some fishes select spawning habitat following odors released by juveniles whose rearing habitat overlaps with spawning habitat. However, juveniles may emigrate before adults begin to search for spawning habitat; hence, the efficacy of juvenile cues could be constrained by degradation or dissipation rates. In lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), odors deposited by the previous year's offspring have been hypothesized to guide adults to spawning reefs. However, in most extant populations, lake trout fry emigrate from spawning reefs during the spring and adults spawn during the fall. Therefore, we postulated that the role of fry odors in guiding habitat selection might be constrained by the time between fry emigration and adult spawning. Time course chemical, physiological, and behavioral assays indicated that the odors deposited by fry likely degrade or dissipate before adults select spawning habitats. Furthermore, fry feces did not attract wild lake trout to constructed spawning reefs in Lake Huron. Taken together, our results indicate fry odors are unlikely to act as cues for lake trout searching for spawning reefs in populations whose juveniles emigrate before the spawning season, and underscore the importance of environmental constraints on social cues.

Biomarker n-alkane proxies (average chain length, Paq ratio, grass/tree ratio, carbon preference index and compound-specific delta C-13 values) were used to reconstruct climate changes that occurred over the last millennium. Compound-specific delta C-13 values show large differences between the distinctive chain length groups of n-alkanes that originate from algae, aquatic macrophytes and terrestrial plants. Long-chain n-alkanes (C-27-C-33) are predominantly derived from leaf wax lipids in the forest. Variations in long-chain n-alkane delta C-13 values may mainly record water-use efficiency, inasmuch as the contribution from C4 plants is negligible in the Lake Xiaolongwan catchment. Short- and middle-chain n-alkanes are mainly from algae and aquatic plants. They are strongly depleted in C-13. This feature may be linked to a methane-derived, negative delta C-13 pool and lake overturn, which regulates dinoflagellate blooms. Parallel fluctuations are observed in delta C-13(27-31) values, Paq, and the grass/tree ratio throughout the record. Variations in delta C-13(27-31) values and Paq are in agreement with historical documents on summer and winter climate conditions. They support earlier suggestions that delta C-13 values in the long-chain n-alkanes and Paq may be useful indicators of effective precipitation or drought stress in this forested area. The delta C-13(27-31) index and Paq show distinct decadal variations. Periods with high delta C-13(27-31) values and a low Paq index correspond with the warm phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Values are reversed during PDO cool phases. At the decadal timescale, summer monsoon rainfall in northeast China over the last millennium may have been regulated mainly by the PDO.

The measurements were carried out in vitro with natural communities grown on artificial Teflon substrates submerged along the lake's shore for 1-2 years. At temperatures above 20 degrees C, epilithon Hg methylation rates were fast and reached a steady state within 12 h upon exposure to 2 ng L-1 of inorganic mercury. A variety of inhibitors were used to identify which microorganisms in the epilithic biofilm are responsible for the methylation. The addition of molybdate, which is believed to suppress the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria, decreased methylmercury production rates by 60% in both light and dark experiments. The prokaryote inhibitor chloramphenicol reduced the methylation rate by 40% only during dark periods whereas an algal inhibitor (DCMU), which suppresses photosynthesis, decreased the methylation rate by 60% during light periods. Results of this study reveal that epilithon communities may be a significant source of MeHg to higher aquatic organisms in lakes and that the integrity of the epilithic biofilm is important for its ability to methylate Hg.

Precise predictions of precipitation trends can play an imperative role in economic growth of a country. This study examined precipitation inconsistency for 23 stations at Dongting Lake, China, over a 52-year study period (1961-2012). Statistical, nonparametric Mann-Kendall (MK) and Spearman's rho tests were applied to identify trends within monthly, seasonal, and annual precipitation. The trend-free pre-whitening method was used to exclude sequential correlation in the precipitation time series. The performance of the Mann-Kendall (MK) and Spearman's rho tests was steady at the tested significance levels. The results showed a fusion of increasing and decreasing trends at different stations within monthly and seasonal time scales. The results obtained with the Mann-Kendall and Spearman's rho tests showed agreement in their assessments of monthly, seasonal, and annual precipitation trends. The variability of negative and positive trends at various stations points to the need for more detailed studies on the climate change of this region. In the case of whole Dongting basin on the monthly time scale, a significant positive trend is found, while at Yuanjiang River and Xianjiag River both positive and negative significant trends are identified. Only Yuanjiang River has shown a significant trend on the seasonal time scale. No significant trends have been exhibited on the annual time scale in any case. In the case of monthly, Nanxian station exhibited the maximum positive increase in monthly precipitation during the months of July and September.

Anders; Hansson, Lars-Anders			Seasonal Migration Determined by a Trade-Off between Predator Avoidance and Growth	PLOS ONE												Migration is a common phenomenon in many organisms, terrestrial as well as aquatic, and considerable effort has been spent to understand the evolution of migratory behaviour and its consequences for population and community dynamics. In aquatic systems, studies on migration have mainly been focused on commercially important fish species, such as salmon and trout. However, seasonal mass-migrations may occur also among other freshwater fish, e. g. in cyprinids that leave lakes and migrate into streams and wetlands in the fall and return back to the lake in spring. In a conceptual model, we hypothesized that this is an adaptive behaviour in response to seasonal changes in predation (P) and growth (G) and that migrating fish change habitat so as to minimise the ratio between predation mortality and growth rate (P/G). Estimates from bioenergetic modelling showed that seasonal changes in the ratio between predator consumption rate and prey growth rate followed the predictions from the conceptual model and also gave more precise predictions for the timing of the habitat change. By quantifying the migration of more than 1800 individually marked fish, we showed that actual migration patterns followed predictions with a remarkable accuracy, suggesting that migration patterns have evolved in response to seasonally fluctuating trade-offs between predator avoidance and foraging gains. Thus, the conceptual model provides a mechanistic understanding to mass-migration in prey fish. Further, we also show that the dominant prey fish is actually absent from the lake during a major part of the year, which should have strong implications for the dynamics of the lake ecosystem through direct and indirect food-web interactions.					; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022; Skov, Christian/X-6511-2019; Nilsson, Anders/H-6836-2014	Skov, Christian/0000-0002-8547-6520; Nilsson, Anders/0000-0002-3541-9835; Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317													1932-6203					APR 16	2008	3	4							e1957	10.1371/journal.pone.0001957	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0001957								18414660					WOS:000260867300009

However, researches that focused on the linkage between floodgates operation and water environmental capacity (WEC) is limited. In this study, WEC, as the maximum pollutant load of pollution sources under the requirement of water quality criteria, was estimated and allocated by a combination of a hydrodynamic model, water quality model, and linear programming model before and after floodgates. The results illustrated that WECof chemical oxygen demand (COD) decreased by 4.35% in 2010 and 7.51% in 2018, that of ammonia nitro-gen(NH 3-N) declined by 8.49% in 2010 and 17.73% in 2018 after floodgates were constructed, respec-tively. The lowest WEC was observed in winter, while the highest one in summer. We inferred that floodgates operation might exert different impacts on WECs in different seasons. Meanwhile, the allowed emissions of COD and NH 3-N thus were re-allocated in the 15 pollution sources. The amount of pol-lutants from the surrounding wastewater treatment plants is suggested to be re-set according to the number of population and natural environmental factors. Additionally, the optimal operation of flood-gates is needed to improve water quality and water use efficiency. This work can provide basic data and information for the successful management of floodgates operation and effective improvement of water quality in a river network. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Keller, T				Keller, T			The food of Cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis) in Bavaria	JOURNAL FUR ORNITHOLOGIE												In Bavaria, an increase in Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis) numbers has lead to increasing conflict between fishermen and conservationists. The diet of cormorants was assessed by examining the contents of oral pellets from seven study sites, thought to be representative of Bavarian waters. These were two large pre-alpine lakes (Chiemsee and Ammersee), a reservoir (Altmuhlsee), two gravel pits (Ochsenanger and Breitengussbacher Baggersee), two uncontrolled or controlled large rivers (Danube and Inn), and a smaller river (Alz). The sample of pellets comprised 2944 collected from these sites in the years 1991-1994 and 1758 from an earlier study (winter 1990/91). Altogether, 9587 individual prey items were found. Of 50 fish species inhabiting the study waters, 24 were found in the pellets of the cormorants, but only 6-10 species accounted for 89-95% by numbers. Moreover, within each site 2 or 3 species predominated by number (57-85%). Most fish remains in pellets were from cyprinids (Cyprinidae) but at times on pre-alpine lakes whitefish (Coregonus spec.) were consumed in numbers. At the lakes Ammersee and Altmuhlsee, as well as on the rivers Danube and Inn, cormorants also fed commonly on Perch (Perca fluviatilis), and along the Danube also on Ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernua) and Striped Ruffe (G. schraetzer), respectively. Only at the River Alz, with its faster flow, were Grayling (Thymallus thymallus) and salmonids (Salmonidae) important as cormorant prey. In general, common shoaling fish species dominated the diet of the birds, an exception being the River Az again. The diet showed highest diversity at the pre-alpine lakes and at the River Danube. There was some seasonal variation in the prey species composition. This was probably caused by fish behaviour and fish movements, which perhaps influenced their Vulnerability to cormorant predation. Some Variation also suggested birds switched between feeding sites. Cormorants used a wide range of the available prey sizes. Mostly, fish of 9-28 cm in length were taken. At the River Alz, the fish sizes consumed were larger than at all other sites. At Lake Ammersee, the only water studied year-round larger prey were taken in winter than in summer. In general, few fry were eaten, as only 32 pellets (1%) contained more than 20 individual fish.																			0021-8375					OCT	1998	139	4					389	400		10.1007/BF01653465	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01653465													WOS:000077213800002

Nevertheless, the pumping of water from a lower reservoir to an upper impoundment, and the return of that water during power generation, can strongly affect the water quality of the reservoirs. In particular, plant operation can alter their thermal structure, deep water mixing, and water circulation characteristics. The objective of this study is to quantify, through the use of 3D hydrodynamic modeling, the potential impacts of a pumped-storage hydroelectric plant on the thermal stability and mixing of two reservoirs in Galicia, northwest of Spain. To this end, three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations were conducted using the model Delft3D. Two different coupled models, one for each reservoir, were constructed and subsequently tested for several stratification scenarios, according to measured temperature profiles during the spring and summer season. Several reservoir minimum and maximum operation water levels were also considered. Model simulations demonstrated a high level of mixing in the vicinity of the intake-outlet structures, in particular during startup of the power plant, regardless of the water level in the reservoir. Beyond this area, the results showed a limited overall effect on stratification and mixing in the upper reservoir, owing to the relation between the inflow temperatures and the initial temperature profile of this reservoir. A more significant alteration of the thermal structure is expected in the lower reservoir due to its narrow shape and shallow depth at the structure location, as well as the temperature differences between receiving waters and inflow.

The Neoproterozoic "Blood Falls" in Tarim Craton and Their Possible Connection With Snowball Earth	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Blood Falls refers to the outflow of iron-rich brine plumes under the Taylor Glacier in Antarctica, which have distinctive blood-like red color. It was proposed that during the Cryogenian, Fe oxides of terrestrial origin accumulated under glaciers via a mechanism similar to the modern Blood Falls, although reports of iron deposits of such novel origin are lacking in literature. The Quruqsay iron formation is hosted in Neoproterozoic glacial sequences in the northern margin of the Tarim Craton in NW China and consist of 15 lenticular iron orebodies. The iron ores are mainly composed of fine Fe-oxide aggregate and clastics, with the latter sometimes occurring as dropstones indicating glacial fluvial deposition. The hematite minerals show positive Ce and Y anomalies but lack positive Eu anomalies, with flat shale-normalized rare Earth elements patterns. The hematite minerals also display remarkably negative epsilon(Nd) values and close-to-0 delta Fe-56 values, which collectively indicate that iron was sourced from continents rather than mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal vents. Additionally, delta O-18 values of the hematite are consistent with the large ice-volume during the Snowball Earth event. Evidence from the Quruqsay iron deposit suggest oxidation of terrestrial sub-glacier iron-bearing discharge in oceans of extensive glaciation, correlating with the predicted Blood Falls-type iron deposits in the Neoproterozoic. The Quruqsay iron formation is a unique hematite-rich iron deposit implying that subglacial lakes can be a significant repository for Fe2+ and that the volume of the Neoproterozoic glaciers may be much higher than the current glacier. Plain Language Summary Blood Falls refers to the red color outflow of iron- rich brine plumes under the Taylor Glacier in Antarctica. During Cryogenian, a very cold Era of the Earth called "Snowball Earth event." A number of iron formation formed at this time, but most were developed in abysmal facies. Blood Falls near continental shelf is relatively rare. The Quruqsay iron formation is hosted in Neoproterozoic glacial sequences in the northern margin of the Tarim craton, NW China. Geological and geochemical features of the iron formation indicate oxidation of terrestrial sub-glacier Fe-bearing discharge in oceans during extensive glaciation, correlating with the predicted Blood Falls- type iron deposits in the Neoproterozoic. According to oxygen isotope balance calculation between glacier, seawater and hematite, the volume of the Neoproterozoic glaciers is estimated to be several times larger than the current glacier.

J	Leconte, R; Pietroniro, A; Peters, DL; Prowse, TD				Leconte, R; Pietroniro, A; Peters, DL; Prowse, TD			Effects of flow regulation on hydrologic patterns of a large, inland delta	REGULATED RIVERS-RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT												The Peace-Athabasca River Delta (PAD) is one of the largest freshwater deltas and most biologically productive in the world. Because regional evaporation is greater than precipitation, the thousands of lakes and wetlands dotting this area rely on periodic flooding from the Peace and Athabasca rivers to be replenished. Flood frequency significantly declined beginning in the mid-1970s, several years after the initiation of flow regulation of the Peace River. However, the drying trend was interrupted in 1996 when the PAD experienced extensive inland inundation on two separate occasions, one in the spring and one in the summer. A one-dimensional numerical hydrodynamic model was used to evaluate the role of flow regulation and hydroclimatic conditions on the water levels of major lakes found in the PAD. Three Peace River flow scenarios were analysed: the observed flows, the flow regime without the 'precautionary drawdown' spill which was required because of the discovery of a sinkhole at the crest of the dam, and the naturalized flow regime, which assumed no dam regulation. Modelling results indicated that the effect of the spill on the flow regime within the PAD was approximately equivalent in magnitude, although different in timing, to what would have resulted from the prevailing hydroclimatic conditions in an unregulated system. Furthermore, even in the absence of the precautionary drawdown spill, the lake levels would have risen well above the maximum daily average, suggesting that 1996 was one of the wettest years on record. Finally, the hydrodynamic regime observed at the end of the summer 1996 was very similar to that modelled under unregulated flow conditions, suggesting that flow regulation could be used to alter the hydrodynamic regime of a large delta to at least partially restore natural conditions and potentially improve ecosystem health.

Permafrost degradation stimulates carbon loss from experimentally warmed tundra	ECOLOGY												A large pool of organic carbon (C) has been accumulating in the Arctic for thousands of years because cold and waterlogged conditions have protected soil organic material from microbial decomposition. As the climate warms this vast and frozen C pool is at risk of being thawed, decomposed, and released to the atmosphere as greenhouse gasses. At the same time, some C losses may be offset by warming-mediated increases in plant productivity. Plant and microbial responses to warming ultimately determine net C exchange from ecosystems, but the timing and magnitude of these responses remain uncertain. Here we show that experimental warming and permafrost (ground that remains below 0 degrees C for two or more consecutive years) degradation led to a two-fold increase in net ecosystem C uptake during the growing season. However, warming also enhanced winter respiration, which entirely offset growing-season C gains. Winter C losses may be even higher in response to actual climate warming than to our experimental manipulations, and, in that scenario, could be expected to more than double overall net C losses from tundra to the atmosphere. Our results highlight the importance of winter processes in determining whether tundra acts as a C source or sink, and demonstrate the potential magnitude of C release from the permafrost zone that might be expected in a warmer climate.					; Hicks Pries, Caitlin/A-1368-2014; Webb, Elizabeth/JMC-6974-2023; Schuur, Edward/ACG-9944-2022; Pries, Caitlin/A-1368-2014	Crummer, Kathryn/0000-0002-4980-6756; Webb, Elizabeth/0000-0001-5398-4478; Hicks Pries, Caitlin/0000-0003-0813-2211; 													0012-9658	1939-9170				MAR	2014	95	3					602	608		10.1890/13-0602.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/13-0602.1								24804439					WOS:000332823100003

Water Temperature and Phytoplankton Abundance	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												Results of a study of the water temperature and phytoplankton abundance in different regions of Lake Baikal according to 15 expeditions from 1994 to 2013 during late summer are present. The spatial distribution and interannual dynamics of phytoplankton are analyzed. The total abundance of phytoplankton in late summer is shown to be high. Its average long-term value for all of the open area of Lake Baikal is 532 +/- 17 thousand cells/L. In Southern Baikal, the west coast is characterized by higher average phytoplankton abundance; in Middle and Northern Baikal, the east coast is rich. No significant differences were found between the hollows of the lake in terms of the development of late summer phytoplankton. The long-term average abundance of phytoplankton in the southern, middle, and northern hollows differs only by <= 1.2 times, but in the middle hollow it is significantly higher than in the northern. In the long-term dynamics, no significant increase in the abundance of late summer phytoplankton was recorded in any of the regions of the lake. The dependence of the total phytoplankton abundance on water temperature is weak; the correlation coefficients between the average annual values of these indicators are <= 0.50.

Predicting Lake Huron Dreissena spp. Spatial distribution patterns from environmental characteristics	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Invasive dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) have altered Great Lakes ecosystems through a multitude of effects on benthic habitats, food web structure, and nutrient cycling. This study explores whether spatially continuous geographic data of environmental factors can be utilized to predict Dreissena spp. spatial distributions on a lake-wide scale. Categorical variables were also assessed for significant relationships with Dreissena spp. biomass. Point observations from the 2017 Lake Huron benthic survey under the Cooperative Science and Monitoring Initiative (CSMI) were utilized for in situ measurements of dreissenid presence and biomass at 119 sites across Lake Huron. Basin, bathymetric zone, and tributary influence were found to have statistically significant relationships to dreissenid biomass. A boosted regression tree (BRT) model (ROC score 0.707) was developed to spatially predict dreissenid presence probability across Lake Huron from six environmental explanatory variables: April, May, and October chlorophyll, June dissolved organic carbon, January bottom temperature, and May bottom temperature. The importance of food availability and bottom temperature illuminated relationships between dreissenid mussels and periods of benthic-pelagic mixing in the spring and fall seasons. Future models could be improved through advancements in survey technology for improved geographic characterization of mussel habitat characteristics and environmental constraints.

Previous studies commonly mentioned that turnover occurs when stratification indices become small, but the threshold is rarely discussed. While turnover phenomena have been extensively studied by evaluating changes in bottom dissolved oxygen (DO), the relationship between the disappearance of hypoxia and water temperature indices has not been determined. This study focused on the factors influencing the minimum thermal gradient (TG) and Schmidt Stability Index (SSI), and the timing of turnover events using DO as an indicator of mixing in the Ogouchi reservoir from 1992 to 2001. The results showed that the occurrence of minimum TG and SSI is mainly driven by inflow retention time and average maximum wind speed. Moreover, minimum air temperature and outflow retention time have few contributions to minimum SSI. It was found that 7 out of 10 years exhibited full winter turnover, while the remaining years showed incomplete mixing with persistent hypoxia at the reservoir bottom. This study identifies four cases based on onset thresholds of 0.0035 degrees C m(-1) for TG and 30 J m(-2) for SSI to explain turnover event: Case 1: an ideal state with stratification indices below the threshold, resulting in the disappearance of hypoxia; Case 2: indices above the threshold sustain hypoxia; Case 3: an irregular state where the indices exceed the threshold, yet hypoxia disappears; and Case 4: an unexpected persistence of hypoxia despite being below the threshold. The majority of the years (70 percent) were explained by thresholds. The multiple regression analysis indicated the importance of wind speed on the turnover event. Therefore, the effect of wind shear was analyzed for 30 percent of the years that cannot be explained by thresholds (cases 3 and 4). Case 3 shows turnover occurrence due to strong accumulated wind shear, despite exceeding thresholds. Conversely, Case 4 reveals weak wind shear preventing bottom water upwelling, even below thresholds. In conclusion, the precise TG and SSI thresholds for the onset of turnover event were determined using DO data. The thresholds explained the occurrence and non-occurrence of turnover event in most of the years and wind speed clarified unexplained cases by thresholds. The presented method successfully evaluated the timing of turnover and can be applicable elsewhere.

Late-Quaternary dynamics and palaeoclimatic implications of an alluvial fan-lake system on the southern Alxa Plateau, NW China	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Alluvial fan-lake complexes are common in the piedmont zone of mountains on the southern Alxa Plateau, NW China. Interconnected by the erosional and depositional processes, they can be treated as a typical source-to-sink system. Yet the dynamics of these coupled sedimentary systems during the Late Quaternary is poorly understood. For example, radiocarbon dating of alluvial fans and elevated shoreline features of megalakes in this area usually yields numerical ages in radical contradiction to those obtained using the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) method. Resolving this controversy of timing of the alluvial fan-lake systems is important for understanding the driving mechanisms of climatic and environmental changes in this ecological vulnerable area. The Yabulai alluvial fan-lake system is an exceptional example for tackling this issue. Here we provide numerical ages from three sites to better understand the dynamics of this sedimentary system during the last interglacial-glacial cycle. Our results, when compared with palaeoclimate proxy records, suggest that the fan-lake system was highly regulated by the East Asian summer monsoon and it has experienced four stages of remarkable changes. Debris flow processes were active and lake level was similar to 30 m higher than that of today during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5. A gradual decrease in the aggradation rate of the alluvial fan along with lake-level fall occurred during MIS 4-3, which was followed by a period of intensive wind erosion corresponding to the Last Glacial Maximum. Postglacial growth of the alluvial fan slowed down substantially and small-scale lake-level fluctuations occurred in the foreland basin. The desiccation of megalakes during recent times suggests that the East Asian summer monsoon may have retreated from this area as semi-arid climate emerged. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

J	MELCHER, J; SEBETICH, MJ				MELCHER, J; SEBETICH, MJ			PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY AND PLANKTON COMMUNITIES IN A 2-RESERVOIR SERIES	WATER RESOURCES BULLETIN												It is suggested that new impoundments undergo an initial period of trophic upsurge lasting one to three years because of organic detritus and inorganic nutrients from the inundated basin. The new Monksville Reservoir in Passaic County, New Jersey, provided an opportunity to study the accelerated transformation of the Wanaque River into a 200-ha lake and to compare productivity with the older Wanaque Reservoir located immediately downstream. A one-year investigation of both reservoirs was conducted during 1988. The primary productivity (0.547 g C m-2 d-1) of the new Monksville Reservoir was not significantly different from that of the established Wanaque Reservoir (0.668 g C m-2 d-1). Mean surface chlorophyll a concentrations were similar (3.0-4.0-mu-g l-1), although the Monksville Reservoir exhibited more pronounced chlorophyll peaks in spring and late autumn. Phytoplankton and zooplankton populations were consistently larger and fluctuated sharply in the Monksville Reservoir. Both reservoirs became thermally stratified, but only the Monksville Reservoir developed a metalimnetic dissolved oxygen minimum. The results demonstrated that the predicted trophic upsurge in the new reservoir did not occur in the first year; therefore, the ecosystem dynamics did not fit the model for larger reservoirs.																			0043-1370					DEC	1990	26	6					949	958																WOS:A1990FF19800009

However, few studies have investigated ecosystem metabolism and its drivers in these ponds. Hourly, daily and seasonal changes in rates of gross primary production, net ecosystem production and ecosystem respiration were determined from automated dissolved oxygen, pH and temperature measurements in full-scale high rate algal ponds over a two-year period. The open water metabolism model was used to assess the dynamics of pond metabolism against a number of measured environmental variables. For the most part, net ecosystem production was positive, meaning that the pond was in net autotrophy, with microalgal photosynthetic production exceeding respiratory organic matter consumption. pH had a negative influence on ecosystem respiration, with respiration rates increasing as diurnal pH increased. Similarly, free ammonia concentration reduced gross primary production rates. Modelled CO2 addition to maintain pH 8, resulted in decreased ecosystem respiration and increased net ecosystem production, particularly in summer with a 50% increase in net ecosystem production. However, modelled CO2 addition did not influence net ecosystem production during winter. The use of the Datasondes coupled with the open water metabolism model provides a cost-effective tool for improved high rate algal pond management through the capture of high frequency metabolism parameters. Better understanding of how the high rate algal pond environment affects both photosynthesis and respiratory losses, will help improve real-time management of the pond, including ammonia and CO2 loading management, to improve effluent quality and biomass yields and reduce excess CO2 off-gassing to atmosphere.

Here, we present a chironomid-based quantitative temperature reconstruction and a record of oxygen isotope composition of chironomid head capsules for the last ca. 1200 years, based on the Lake Prata core (Sao Miguel Island, Azores). Chironomids from Lake Prata show that the temperature trend is aligned with the prevailing past global temperature trends, indicating warming during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; ca. 950-1300 CE) and subsequent cooling during the Little Ice Age (LIA; ca. 1300-1800 CE). Furthermore, changes in lake water oxygen isotope composition from chironomid head capsules were recorded with more positive delta 18O values (18.2 +/- 0.2%o) during the MCA and more negative values (varying between 14.8%o and 17.6%o) during the LIA, indicating a positive shift in the precipitation-evaporation balance and/or heavier precipitation in winter relative to summer. Our study revealed that, in subtropical regions with a temperate oceanic climate and low thermal variation, there is a limited correlation between the isotopic composition of precipitation and temperature. Additionally, the temporal sequence of oxygen isotope values obtained from chironomid head capsules closely corresponds to variations in precipitation seasonality inferred from distinct climatic proxies. This consistency underscores the robustness of quantitative reconstructions and indicates that delta 18Ochironomid records are promising for future investigations, especially in the context of lakes located on oceanic islands characterised by limited thermal variability.

To investigate the potential for contaminants in LW influent to produce effects indicative of endocrine disruption in vivo, adult male and female common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were exposed in cages for 42-48 d at four sites in Lake Mead: LW, LX, and two reference locations in the lake. End points examined included gonadosomatic index; gonad histology; concentrations of plasma vitellogenin (VTG) and plasma sex steroids (17beta-estradiol (E2),testosterone (T), 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT)); plasma estrogen:androgen ratios (E2:T, E2:11-KT), in vitro production of T by gonad tissue, and hepatopancreas ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity. Few differences among fish caged at different sites were potentially attributable to exposure to contaminants in LW influent. Male carp caged at LW had slightly greater concentrations of plasma VTG than those at other sites, and a modest elevation in plasma E2 was observed in male carp at LX and LW, but causes other than contaminant exposure cannot be ruled out.

J	Kluender, ER; Adams, R; Lewis, L				Kluender, Edward R.; Adams, Reid; Lewis, Lindsey			Seasonal habitat use of alligator gar in a river-floodplain ecosystem at multiple spatial scales	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Alligator gar (Atractosteus spatula) populations are declining throughout their range in the United States, even where considered stable. Similar declines in other riverine species are occurring worldwide due to alteration of habitat in river-floodplain systems. Most rivers in the world are highly regulated, resulting in departures from historic hydrology that provides connection to the floodplain habitats used by riverine fishes. Knowledge of the seasonal habitat requirements of alligator gar and similar riverine fishes at a watershed scale is limited, hindering management practices. We used radiotelemetry to monitor movements and habitat use of adult alligator gar (N=32; 25.0-84.5kg; 149-224cm) at macro- and microhabitat scales during 2years of varying hydrology. Fish showed seasonal differences in their use of main channel and floodplain macrohabitats. Floodplain tributaries and their upper reaches were especially important to reproductive ecology. Minimum distance travelled per day varied seasonally. While using the main channel Fourche LaFave River, gar selected low velocity, shallow depth and complex structure along channel margins. The Fourche LaFave River is unique in its connection to floodplain habitats on a relatively predictable basis, with frequent flooding during the spring and summer reproductive period. Our study emphasises the importance of connectivity between the main river channel and floodplain habitats to a floodplain-obligate riverine species. An intact, heterogeneous riparian zone creates essential microhabitat for the species. Understanding habitat requirements of alligator gar at multiple spatial scales in a river-floodplain system is crucial to management of many other species and river systems.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				APR	2017	26	2					233	246		10.1111/eff.12270	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12270													WOS:000395645400006
J	KOZAKIEWICZ, A				KOZAKIEWICZ, A			SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION AND INTERSPECIFIC INTERACTIONS IN SMALL RODENT COMMUNITY OF A LAKE COASTAL ZONE	ACTA THERIOLOGICA												Use of space and interspecific interactions in a small rodent community were studied in a lake coastal zone. The material was collected by a CMR method on two 1-ha plots: CP.sbd.control plot and EP.sbd.experimental plot, in four trapping series, in summer and early autumn. After two trapping series all small rodents were removed from EP. On the two plots, seven species of rodents were found; Clethrionomys glareolus, Apodemus flavicollis, A. agrarius and Microtus oeconomus were most numerous. On the basis of CMA coefficient and assessment of random nature of occurrencies of the pairs of species in the same stations by .chi.2 text, the following competitive interspecific interactions were identified: A. agrarius/A. flavicollis, M. oeconomus/A. flavicollis, M. oeconomus/C. glareolus, and C. glareolus/A. agrarius although this last interaction was less marked on EP than on permanently inhabited CP. At the beginning of the experiment, the communities inhabiting CP and EP differed. After the environmental gap was filled, the appearance of community structure on the two plots coverged. A similar distribution of principally different space between the species occurring on the two plots took place adequately to their environmental requirements and to the competitive interspecific interactions with the latter being somewhat dependent on the timing of their arrival in the habitat.																			0001-7051	2190-3743				DEC	1987	32	21-31					433	447		10.4098/AT.arch.87-30	http://dx.doi.org/10.4098/AT.arch.87-30													WOS:A1987N235300006
J	Kilgore, MJ; Fairbanks, WS				Kilgore, MJ; Fairbanks, WS			Winter habitat selection by reintroduced pronghorn on Antelope Island, Great Salt Lake, Utah	GREAT BASIN NATURALIST												The recent and future introduction of several ungulate species on Antelope Island necessitates knowledge of habitat use by each species. In this study habitat preferences of reintroduced pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) on Antelope Island were evaluated during February-March 1993 and January-March 1994. Elevation, slope, physiography, aspect, and habitat type of sites used by pronghorn were compared to similar data collected from random points. During the severe winter of 1993, pronghorn preferred terrain that was 1281-1380 m in elevation and was relatively flat or at the base of a hill. Slopes greater than 30% were avoided. South-facing slopes were preferred; west-facing slopes were avoided. Pronghorn preferred sagebrush habitats and avoided grasslands. During the mild winter of 1994, pronghorn showed preferences for slightly higher elevations, avoided slopes greater than 30%, but used other habitat features in proportion to their availability. Future winter studies of pronghorn should include considerations of snowfall patterns and the availability, versus tile abundance, of sagebrush.						Fairbanks, W.

LIMNOLOGICA												Functional groups of phytoplankton are widely recognized to vary in response to certain environmental variables, according to their niche preferences. The aim of this study was to evaluate the strength of the relationship between functional traits of phytoplankton and environmental predictors in a spatially heterogeneous large subtropical shallow lake (Mangueira Lake, southern Brazil), analyzing whether phytoplankton functional approach is a suitable tool to investigate spatial heterogeneity. Samples were taken twice a year (summer and winter), for six years (2001-2006) in the subsurface water at north, center and south sampling stations in that large system (90 km long). This biannual frequency enabled us to evaluate the seasonal and spatial changes of functional groups in relation to environmental variations, by means of ordination analysis (PCA and CCA). The integrated analysis of phytoplankton functional groups and abiotic variables evidenced clear and significant spatial and seasonal gradients (Monte Carlo test, p = 0.01). The seasonal gradient was related to temperature, water-level fluctuations and wind action, leading to spatial heterogeneity of the phytoplankton. The northern part of the lake proved to be dissimilar, with greater availability of soluble reactive phosphorus and higher biomass of phytoplankton. Functional groups related to turbid and mixed environments, such as MP, S1 and J were important. Hydrodynamics-related features were the driving forces for structuring the phytoplankton functional groups, which appropriately showed the main tendencies observed in this ecosystem, proving to be and adequate tool to access spatial heterogeneity.

J	QUADE, J				QUADE, J			LATE QUATERNARY ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGES IN THE UPPER LAS-VEGAS VALLEY, NEVADA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Five stratigraphic units and five soils of late Pleistocene to Holocene age crop out in dissected badlands on Corn Creek Flat, 30 km northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada, and at Tule Springs, nearer to Las Vegas. The record is dominantly fluvial but contains evidence of several moister, marsh-forming periods: the oldest (Unit B) dates perhaps to the middle Wisconsin, and the more wide-spread Unit D falls between 30,000 and 15,000 yr B. P. Unit D therefore correlates with pluvial maximum lacustrine deposits elsewhere in the Great Basin. Standing water was not of sufficient depth or extent during either period to form lake strandlines. Between 14,000 and 7200 yr B.P. (Unit E), standing surface water gradually decreased, a trend also apparent in Great Basin pluvial lake chronologies during the same period. Groundwater carbonate cementation and burrowing by cicadas (Cicadae) accompany the moist-phase units. After 7200 yr B.P., increased wind action, decreased biotic activity, and at least 25 m of water-table lowering accompanied widespread erosion of older fine-grained deposits. Based on pack-rat midden and pollen evidence, this coincides with major vegetation changes in the valley, from sagebrush-dominated steppe to lower Mohave desertscrub.																			0033-5894	1096-0287				NOV	1986	26	3					340	357		10.1016/0033-5894(86)90094-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0033-5894(86)90094-3													WOS:A1986E737300005

Determining the spatial and seasonal variability in OM/OC ratios across the US using multiple regression	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Data from the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) network are used to estimate organic mass to organic carbon (OM/OC) ratios across the United States by extending previously published multiple regression techniques. Our new methodology addresses common pitfalls of multiple regression including measurement uncertainty, colinearity of covariates, dataset selection, and model selection. As expected, summertime OM/OC ratios are larger than wintertime values across the US with all regional median OM/OC values tightly confined between 1.80 and 1.95. Further, we find that OM/OC ratios during the winter are distinctly larger in the eastern US than in the West (regional medians are 1.58, 1.64, and 1.85 in the great lakes, southeast, and northeast regions, versus 1.29 and 1.32 in the western and central states). We find less spatial variability in long-term averaged OM/OC ratios across the US (90% of our multiyear regressions estimate OM/OC ratios between 1.37 and 1.94) than previous studies (90% fell between 1.30 and 2.10). We attribute this difference largely to the inclusion of EC as a covariate in previous regression studies. Due to the colinearity of EC and OC, we find that up to one-quarter of the OM/OC estimates in a previous study are biased low. Assumptions about OC measurement artifacts add uncertainty to our estimates of OM/OC. In addition to estimating OM/OC ratios, our technique reveals trends that may be contrasted with conventional assumptions regarding nitrate, sulfate, and soil across the IMPROVE network. For example, our regressions show pronounced seasonal and spatial variability in both nitrate volatilization and sulfate neutralization and hydration.

The dominant diatoms are studied using light microscopy and identified using valve morphometrics. The study enlists a total of 74 taxa belonging to 40 genera along with photomicrographic plates. Commonly-found species of high-altitude hot springs habitats were Gogorevia exilis and Denticula thermaloides. Reimeria sinuata, Fragilaria vaucheriae, Gomphonella cf. olivacea, Encyonema ventricosum, Lindavia biswashanti, Diatoma moniliformis, and Denticula valida were commonly occurring species in stream, river and lake habitats. Further analysis and putative novel species from this high-altitude environment will be described in future publications.					; Thacker, Mital/JBS-7367-2023; Balasubramanian, Karthick/P-5763-2014	Karthick, Balasubramanian/0000-0003-4066-2458; 													1730-413X	1897-3191				JUN 1	2023	52	2					172	205		10.26881/oahs-2023.2.04	http://dx.doi.org/10.26881/oahs-2023.2.04													WOS:001021535400004

The study aims to examine the changes of sediment provenance and geochemical composition in response to Asian summer monsoon variability since the last interglacial period. Major elemental analyses on lacustrine samples and sand samples from Lake Xingkai and the surrounding sandy ridges in northeast China indicate that their abundance varied in relatively narrow ranges. The samples had only undergone the primary stage of chemical weathering. Similar Ti/Al and K/Al ratios between the lacustrine samples from Lake Xingkai and the loess-paleosol samples in north China were observed, which suggests that they come from broadly similar desert sources. Due to the significant dependence on grain-size and influence of sediments recycling, Chemical Index of Alteration of the lacustrine sediments could not be regarded as sensitive indicators of source regions' weathering on the glacial-interglacial timescale. Alternatively, the geochemical proxies of the lacustrine sediments could be linked to the Asian summer monsoon through the development of runoff and physical erosion in the catchment. Weakened Asian summer monsoon caused more fine particles transported to the lake basin by reduced runoff in the last glacial period. In contrast, coarser and less-weathered detritus are transported into the lake accompanying strengthened Asian summer monsoon during the warm periods.					sun, weiwei/GQG-8925-2022; Zhang, Youchi/M-6989-2016	Zhang, Enlou/0000-0002-8057-7760													0031-0182	1872-616X				DEC 26	2018	512		2		SI		71	79		10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.06.026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.06.026													WOS:000454973500007

Combining lake core records with the limnologic model DYRESM-CAEDYM to evaluate lake response during the Little Ice Age and Medieval Climate Anomaly	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The Little Ice Age and Medieval Climate Anomaly are two climatic intervals within the last 2000 years that had distinctive conditions in many North American paleoclimate reconstructions. During each of these intervals, the Crevice Lake, Montana paleorecord shows distinctive limnological characteristics inferred from fossil diatoms that reflect changes in temperature seasonality and lake thermal structure. A thermodynamic-ecological model, DYRESM-CAEDYM, was used to estimate climatic conditions during these time intervals and to explore the potential for linking paleo-records with lake models to evaluate the dynamic interactions of environmental variables in influencing diatom populations over time. The model effectively simulates the timing and distribution of Stephanodiscus and Cyclotella populations evident in the modern Crevice Lake observational data. In sensitivity tests altering multiple weather inputs had a greater effect on lake temperature isotherm patterns compared with changing only single variables, which suggests the interactive effect of multiple climate variables in affecting lake thermal structure. The model simulations show the importance of the rate of climate change in affecting lake thermal structure and diatom community structure, particularly during spring and early summer. The model also provides constraints on the range of changes in solar radiation, temperature, and wind speeds that may have produced the diatom communities characteristic of the Medieval Climate Anomaly, Little Ice Age, and contemporary times.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				JUN	2016	56	1					79	92		10.1007/s10933-016-9893-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-016-9893-3													WOS:000376893600007
J	COUTANT, CC; BENSON, DL				COUTANT, CC; BENSON, DL			SUMMER HABITAT SUITABILITY FOR STRIPED BASS IN CHESAPEAKE BAY - REFLECTIONS ON A POPULATION DECLINE	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We evaluated summer water temperatures, dissolved oxygen concentrations, distribution of striped bass Morone saxatilis subadults and adults, and juvenile abundance indexes in Chesapeake Bay to discern any influences of summer habitat suitability on historical changes in populations. Criteria for habitat suitability were those identified in freshwater reservoirs (temperature below 25-degrees-C and dissolved oxygen above 2-3 mg/L), which we confirmed for the York-Pamunkey estuary in the lower bay. Habitat suitability in the upper central basin in July declined significantly from 1962 to 1987, as did juvenile abundance indexes (mean catches per standard seine haul). Thickness of suitable temperature-oxygen habitat correlated significantly with Maryland juvenile indexes the following year. Relative reproductive performance of upper (Maryland) and lower (Virginia) bay stocks changed between 1967-1973 and 1980-1988 in parallel with reduction in upper bay summer habitat. The annual temperature-oxygen cycle in the bay revealed two key areas for striped bass subadults and adults: (1) a zone of cool water in north-central Chesapeake Bay near Annapolis, Maryland, where fish of these ages congregate in summer, and (2) a shallow sill across the lower bay near the mouth of the Rappahannock River, Virginia, where warm surface waters ( > 25-degrees-C) in summer impinge on the bottom and may block egress from the bay. The importance of year-round bay residents for reproduction in the upper bay may have been underestimated previously, at least for the recent low population levels. Reduced juvenile production at the head of the bay and population decline would be consistent with limitation of historically important habitat in summer and resultant physiological stresses of high temperature and low dissolved oxygen that affect reproductive competence the following year.																			0002-8487					JUL	1990	119	4					757	778		10.1577/1548-8659(1990)119<0757:SHSFSB>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1990)119<0757:SHSFSB>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1990EQ37000018

The seasonal timing, or phenology, of many lake processes are changing in response to human activities. However, long-term records exist for few lakes, and extrapolating patterns observed in these lakes to entire landscapes is exceedingly difficult using the limited number of available in situ observations. Limited landscape-level observations mean we do not know how common shifts in lake phenology are at macroscales. Here, we use a new remote sensing data set, LimnoSat-US, to analyze U.S. summer lake color phenology between 1984 and 2020 across more than 26,000 lakes. Our results show that summer lake color seasonality can be generalized into five distinct phenology groups that follow well-known patterns of phytoplankton succession. The frequency with which lakes transition from one phenology group to another is tied to lake and landscape level characteristics. Lakes with high inflows and low variation in their seasonal surface area are generally more stable, while lakes in areas with high interannual variations in climate and catchment population density show less stability. Our results reveal previously unexamined spatiotemporal patterns in lake seasonality and demonstrate the utility of LimnoSat-US, which, with over 22 million remote sensing observations of lakes, creates novel opportunities to examine changing lake ecosystems at a national scale.

An existing automatic SIMBA-algorithm was further developed to derive air/snow, snow/ice and ice/water interfaces based on the SIMBA environment temperature (ET) profiles. The identified interfaces agreed with in situ observations made in 2011/12 winter season. The method was capable to identify upward-moving snow/ice interface that was also visible from SIMBA heating temperature (HT) profiles, which responds to differences in the thermal diffusivities of air, snow, ice and water. The SIMBA data obtained in winters 2017/18 and 2018/19 were used to investigate snow and ice mass balance. An upward-moving snow/ice interface was detected as a result of meteoric ice (snow ice and superimposed ice) formation. Snow contributed to granular lake ice formation up to 40-55% of the total ice thickness on the seasonal mean. Heavy snowfalls and low air temperature in early winter are favourable for granular ice formation. The seasonal mean snow depth on nearby land was 2.7-2.9 times of that on the lake. The estimation of freeboard from snow and ice mass-balance measurement is sensitive to the snow density. Accurate ice freeboard calculation is still a challenge.					cheng, Yubing/GYR-3104-2022; Cheng, Bin/D-4354-2013; Zheng, Fei/O-8876-2016; Vihma, Timo/ABC-9771-2020; Kontu, Anna/O-8886-2014	Cheng, Bin/0000-0001-8156-8412; Cheng, Yubing/0000-0002-1341-5913; 													0260-3055	1727-5644				DEC	2020	61	83					309	319	PII S0260305520000518	10.1017/aog.2020.51	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/aog.2020.51													WOS:000652595200006

In this study atrazine losses from surface runoff and tile flow under different cropping and soil management practices for four years of monitoring were studied. The loss from surface flow was much less than that from tile flow. The major loss of atrazine occurred within three months after application and was generally caused by heavy rainfall, Early application without anything growing in the field or atr azine application some rime Inter than planting caused an increase of atrazine losses during rainfall. This suggests that the greatest use of atrazine was at the beginning of weed growth. Therefore, rite best time for atrazine application is just before or at the beginning of weed growth. The amount, timing, and distribution of rainfall and stage of plant growth influence the movement of atrazine.

Diversity and Expression of RubisCO Genes in a Perennially Ice-Covered Antarctic Lake during the Polar Night Transition	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The autotrophic communities in the lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, have generated interest since the early 1960s owing to low light transmission through the permanent ice covers, a strongly bimodal seasonal light cycle, constant cold water temperatures, and geographical isolation. Previous work has shown that autotrophic carbon fixation in these lakes provides an important source of organic matter to this polar desert. Lake Bonney has two lobes separated by a shallow sill and is one of several chemically stratified lakes in the dry valleys that support year-round biological activity. As part of an International Polar Year initiative, we monitored the diversity and abundance of major isoforms of RubisCO in Lake Bonney by using a combined sequencing and quantitative PCR approach during the transition from summer to polar winter. Form ID RubisCO genes related to a stramenopile, a haptophyte, and a cryptophyte were identified, while primers specific for form IA/B RubisCO detected a diverse autotrophic community of chlorophytes, cyanobacteria, and chemoautotrophic proteobacteria. Form ID RubisCO dominated phytoplankton communities in both lobes of the lake and closely matched depth profiles for photosynthesis and chlorophyll. Our results indicate a coupling between light availability, photosynthesis, and rbcL mRNA levels in deep phytoplankton populations. Regulatory control of rbcL in phytoplankton living in nutrient-deprived shallow depths does not appear to be solely light dependent. The distinct water chemistries of the east and west lobes have resulted in depth- and lobe-dependent variability in RubisCO diversity, which plays a role in transcriptional activity of the key gene responsible for carbon fixation.					; Kong, Weidong/H-7432-2012	Morgan-kiss, Rachael/0000-0003-4783-5358; Kong, Weidong/0000-0001-9682-1484													0099-2240	1098-5336				JUN	2012	78	12					4358	4366		10.1128/AEM.00029-12	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00029-12								22492447					WOS:000304788500039

Quantifying CDOM and DOC in major Arctic rivers during ice-free conditions using Landsat TM and ETM plus data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												As high-latitudes warm, permafrost thaws, and the hydrological cycle accelerates, ground-based monitoring of riverine organic matter may be supplemented by satellite remote sensing during ice-free conditions. Recent programs, namely the Arctic Great Rivers Observatory, have established methodologically consistent sampling across the hydrograph, and shared the resulting data publicly. However, these efforts are limited by frequency, funding, and length of record. Satellite remote sensing can be used to estimate chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) as a riverine constituent that influences optical properties in surface waters. In this study, daily CDOM absorption was first estimated using discharge-constituent regression-based models for 2000-2013. We then regressed these discharge-based CDOM estimates against Landsat TM and ETM + surface reflectance data from Google Earth Engine for the six largest rivers draining the pan-Arctic watershed (the Kolyma, Lena, Mackenzie, Ob', Yenisey, and Yukon rivers). These CDOM results were converted to dissolved organic carbon (DOC), using the strong relationship (R-2 = 0.88) between direct measurements of the two constituents. Using river-specific remote sensing models, R-2 could be as high as 0.84. Grouping all rivers into a single "universal" regression reduced R-2 and increased root mean square errors, such as in the Yenisey River where R-2 dropped by 0.63, and RMSE rose by 1.1 m(-1). Seasonally varying discharge drove much of the variation in satellite-derived CDOM and DOC, corroborating recent studies. Satellite imagery can increase the frequency of monitoring observations, particularly during summer and fall when riverine CDOM absorption may be most sensitive to thawing permafrost.

The first appearance of the species in this region was recorded in 1991. At present Oxyura leucocephala is a small wintering and migratory species found on the Black Sea coast of the Krasnodarsky Krai (Russia) and Abkhazia. Single individuals or pairs of birds are usually noted, less often groups of up to ten white-headed ducks. The most significant was the wintering of Oxyura leucocephala on the lakes of the natural ornithological park in the Imeretinskaya lowland (Sochi, Russia) in 2016-2017. An assumption is being made about the formation of a new wintering area for Oxyura leucocephala occupying the northeastern coast of the Black Sea.

The Spawning of an Urban Fisheries Program in Texas	URBAN AND COMMUNITY FISHERIES PROGRAMMS: DEVELOPMENT, MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATION	American Fisheries Society Symposium				137th Annual Meeting of the American-Fisheries-Society	SEP 02-06, 2007	San Francisco, CA	Amer Fisheries Soc				The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) has promoted urban fishing for years, but recent population growth added impetus to provide high quality fishing "close to home" for the state's 17 million urbanites. A statewide network of community fishing lakes in small towns had been stocked annually with 229 mm channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus in the fall and 200 mm rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in the winter. However, this practice had limited success in providing year-round fishing or recruiting new anglers. Therefore, TPWD biologists developed an improved Neighborhood Fishing Program focused on the large metropolitan areas where 80% of the population lives. Initially, we reviewed programs in other states and then evaluated usage, harvest, angler expenditures, demographics and regulation compliance within the TPWD program. Our program enhancements were based upon ongoing evaluations and a model program has now developed that provides quality, year-round angling opportunities in metropolitan areas and targets nontraditional users. Our program aims to be self-supporting, easily expandable, to form effective partnerships, include angler education and tackle loans, plus have a successful marketing strategy. Some 30,000 anglers participated in the pilot phase in 2006 at eight small urban impoundments.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-04-2				2008	67						255	+																WOS:000261329900021

Using an approximately six-decade long in situ data set, we explored the changes in lake surface-water temperature (LST), lake deep-water temperature (LDT), lake depth-weighted mean water temperature (LDMT), and ice-free days in Lake Kallavesi, a boreal lake in central Finland, when the lake was stratified (June-August). Our results suggest that the LST is warming faster than the local air temperature (AT). As for the LST, fast warming was also observed in the LDT and LDMT, but at rates slower than those in the LST. The number of ice-free days also shows an upward trend, with a rate of about 7 days per decade during the study period. The corresponding local AT is the main driver of the LST, followed by the ice-free days and annual mean AT. Air temperature and ice-free days also mainly contribute to the changes in the LDMT. The LDT is affected more by the North Atlantic Oscillation signals in this freshwater lake. The AT in the prior months does not affect the LDT in Lake Kallavesi although the AT during the prior season, that is, spring, is the main driver of summer LDT. This highlights the local AT impact on the LDT at time scales longer than a month. The warming rates in the lake water are at a minimum in June because the lake is not yet strongly stratified in this month when compared to July and August. These findings improve our knowledge of long-term changes in the lake water temperature in a high-latitude lake, a region with severe environmental consequences due to fast changes in the AT and lake ice phenology.

Bosmina longirostris, Diaptomidae, Cyclops, and Daphnia galeata contributed greatly to the separation of the two time periods with Diaptomidae and D. galeata increasing and Cyclops and B. longirostris decreasing, although B. longirostris remained the dominant species. Peak densities of zooplankton occurred in early summer (June) in the 1990s and in early fall (October) in 2009-2010. For the analysis of environmental variables on a bay-wide, annual basis, abundance of alewife, age-0 yellow perch Perca flavescens and Bythotrephes captured much of the variation in annual zooplankton community structure. Abundances of Bythotrephes and age-0 yellow perch were both higher in 2009-2010 than in 1991-1996. Some changes such as increasing proportions of calanoid copepods reflect a more oligotrophic community and are potentially indicative of resource-driven changes rather than direct or indirect impacts of the alewife disappearance.

The seasonal dynamic of cyanobacterial blooms is a well-known phenomenon in lakes and reservoirs in temperate zones. Nevertheless, in the tropics, most studies have been performed in shallow and artificial lakes; therefore, the seasonal dynamic of cyanobacterial blooms in deep and eutrophic tropical lakes is still under research. We studied the seasonal variation of the phytoplankton community and the factors associated with Microcystis aeruginosa blooms along the water column of Lake Alberca de Tacambaro, a warm monomictic crater lake located in Mexico, during 2018 and 2019. According to previous studies performed in 2006 and 2009-2010, this lake was mesotrophic-eutrophic, with Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta as the dominant groups of the phytoplankton community. During 2018 and 2019, the lake was eutrophic and occasionally, hypertrophic. The dominant species was M. aeruginosa, forming blooms at different depths, and mostly, during autumn and winter months. These findings suggest that M. aeruginosa in Lake Alberca de Tacambaro displays seasonal and spatial population dynamics. Total phosphorus, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, water temperature and photosynthetically active radiation were the environmental factors related to M. aeruginosa blooms. Our results suggest that the changes in the structure of the phytoplankton community through time, and M. aeruginosa blooms in Lake Alberca de Tacambaro, are mainly related to changes in land use from forest to farmland in areas adjacent to the lake, which promoted its eutrophication in the last years through runoffs. Comparative studies with other deep and eutrophic lakes will allow us to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamic of cyanobacterial blooms in natural and artificial water reservoirs strongly stressed by human activities.					; Favila, Mario/ISU-9307-2023; Hernández, Eloy/P-3592-2015; Favila, Mario E./Q-8877-2018	Montero Hernandez, Eloy/0000-0001-8706-7213; Favila, Mario E./0000-0002-2737-9327													1129-5767	1723-8633					2021	80	2							2013	10.4081/jlimnol.2021.2013	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2021.2013													WOS:000663904900009

Wintering waterfowl community structure and the characteristics of gravel pit lakes	WILDLIFE BIOLOGY												Wintering waterfowl community structure and their association with lake characteristics were studied in the Cotswold Water Park, a complex of more than 120 gravel pit lakes in southern England. The major distinction in community types was between assemblages dominated by diving waterfowl and those dominated by dabbling waterfowl. The trophic status of lakes was found to be a major determinant of community structure: young lakes in the early stages of a natural process of eutrophication tended to support the most diverse assemblages of diving waterfowl. The abundance of individual species was strongly related to lake size and assemblage type. Some effects of food supply and the recreational use of lakes were also apparent. The relevance of the findings for the sustainable value of the lakes for wintering waterfowl is discussed.																			0909-6396						1997	3	2					65	78		10.2981/wlb.1997.009	http://dx.doi.org/10.2981/wlb.1997.009													WOS:000208522600001
J	Barboni, D; Ashley, GM; Bourel, B; Arráiz, H; Mazur, JC				Barboni, Doris; Ashley, Gail M.; Bourel, Benjamin; Arraiz, Hector; Mazur, Jean-Charles			Springs, palm groves, and the record of early hominins in Africa	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												Hominins evolved in Africa during a period of overall regional cooling, drying, and increasingly variable climate. Despite prevailing regional aridity since the mid-Miocene, data show that early hominins Sahelanthropus tchadensis, Orrorin tugenensis, and Ardipithecus ramidus lived in environments made of mosaics of grasslands, mixed grasslands, woodlands, and forests, where wooded habitats were maintained by edaphic rather than regional (climatic) humidity. Groundwater systems (springs, seeps, shallow aquifers) and surface water (rivers, lakes), locally create wetter and more wooded environments in addition to that supported by precipitation alone. However, edaphically sustained woodlands are rare to missing in most published paleoeclogical interpretations of hominin archeological sites. To explore the importance of groundwater to the record of hominins in Africa, we provide newly acquired field data from spring sites in the Awash Valley, Ethiopia, and Lake Eyasi-Lake Manyara region, Tanzania, and re-evaluate published data from the Ardipithecus-bearing Aramis Member, Ethiopia. Results show that (1) in arid Eastern Africa, a wide variety of microhabitats such as groundwater-fed wetlands, Hyphaene palm woodlands, Phoenix reclinata palm woodlands, and structurally complex and species-rich forest patches exist due to local variability of geologic, topographic, and hydrologic conditions. (2) These microhabitats carry some characteristic pollen and phytolith signals, that may be easily masked by the signal of surrounding grass-dominated shrublands and grasslands. (3) The Aramis Member (Awash Valley, Ethiopia), which is to date, the best documented paleo-groundwater ecosystem, is not a riparian habitat. It is one of >50 examples (within 22 geographically distinct areas) in Africa and the Middle East where evidence of groundwater systems co-exist with hominin and/or archeological remains. Springs are commonly localized features of limited area within a landscape, but provide ecological continuity through time and diverse microhabitats, some of which may be densely forested. At the local scale, springs create microclimates, distinctive vegetation, and increase soil nutrients, species richness, structural complexity, and provide habitat for animals. At the landscape scale, they represent hydro-refugia favoring increased connectivity among animals and allowing migrations during dry periods. We conclude that in the East African Rift where low, highly seasonal rainfall and high evaporative demand limit vegetation growth in many areas, groundwater-fed zones create diverse microhabitats and play a major role in ecosystem functioning. It is likely that, within a context of increasing aridity and expansion of grass-dominated open habitats during the Mio-Pliocene, early hominins and many other animals viewed edaphically sustained woodlands as attractive habitats.

J	Ladd, C; Cheng, W; Salo, S				Ladd, Carol; Cheng, Wei; Salo, Sigrid			Gap winds and their effects on regional oceanography Part II: Kodiak Island, Alaska	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Frequent gap winds, defined here as offshore-directed flow channeled through mountain gaps, have been observed near Kodiak Island in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). Gap winds from the Iliamna Lake gap were investigated using QuikSCAT wind data. The influence of these wind events on the regional ocean was examined using satellite and in situ data combined with Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) model runs. Gap winds influence the entire shelf width ( > 200 km) northeast of Kodiak Island and extend an additional similar to 150 km off-shelf. Due to strong gradients in the along-shelf direction, they can result in vertical velocities in the ocean of over 20 m d(-1) due to Ekman pumping. The wind events also disrupt flow of the Alaska. Coastal Current (ACC), resulting in decreased flow down Shelikof Strait and increased velocities on the outer shelf. This disruption of the ACC has implications for freshwater transport into the Bering Sea. The oceanographic response to gap winds may influence the survival of larval fishes as Arrowtooth Flounder recruitment is negatively correlated with the interannual frequency of gap-wind events, and Pacific Cod recruitment is positively correlated. The frequency of offshore directed winds exhibits a strong seasonal cycle averaging similar to 7 days per month during winter and similar to 2 days per month during summer. Interannual variability is correlated with the Pacific North America Index and shows a linear trend, increasing by 1.35 days per year.

In 1962, all observed bluegill nests on 4 of these lakes were treated with copper sulfate crystals every 3 or 4 days throughout the bluegill spawning season in an attempt to kill all eggs and fry. In the fall of 1962, all eight lakes were seined and the results compared with pre-treatment data. The variability of the seining data was so great that no significant reduction in fingerling bluegill populations could be demonstrated for the treatments. In the treated lakes, more bluegills were collected in the fall of the treatment year than in the previous year. Even if the treatments had been successful, this technique required too much work for adoption as a management procedure.

Little Rock Lake (Treatment Basin) received no groundwater discharge during the study period (1988-1990), and Pallette Lake received continuous groundwater discharge. In Little Rock Lake, settling of particulate matter accounted for the major Hg delivery mechanism to the sediment-water interface. Upward diffusion of Hg from sediment pore waters below 2-4-cm sediment depth teas apparently a minor source during summer stratification. Time-series comparisons suggested that the observed buildup of Hg in the hypolimnion of little Rock Lake was attributable to dissolution and diffusion of Hg from recently fallen particulate matter close to the sediment-water interface. Groundwater inflow represented an important source of new Hg, and groundwater outflow accounted for significant removal of Hg from Pallette Lake. Equilibrium speciation calculations revealed that association of Hg with organic matter may control solubility in well-oxygenated waters, whereas in anoxic environments sulfur (polysulfide and bisulfide) complexation governs dissolved total Hg levels.

J	Oveisy, A; Boegman, L				Oveisy, Ali; Boegman, Leon			One-dimensional simulation of lake and ice dynamics during winter	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												An ice formation model, based on the solution of the heat conduction equation across blue ice, white ice and snow cover, is integrated into the Dynamic Reservoir Simulation Model (DYRESM) to allow for one-dimensional (vertical) winter simulation of lake dynamics during periods of ice cover. This is an extension of a previous three-layer snow and ice model to include two-way coupling between the ice and the water column. The process-based ice formation is suitable for application to mid-latitude regions and includes: snowmelt due to rain; formation of white ice; and variability in snow density, snow conductivity, and ice and snow albedo. The model was validated against published observations from Harmon Lake, British Columbia, and new observations from Eagle Lake, Ontario. The ice thickness and water column temperature profile beneath the ice were predicted with Root Mean Square Deviations (RMSD) of 1 cm and 0.38 degrees C, respectively, during the winter of 1990-91in Harmon Lake. In Eagle Lake the 2011-12 year-round water column temperature profile was predicted with an RMSD of 1.8 degrees C. Improved prediction of under-ice lake temperature, relative to published results from simpler models, demonstrates the need for models that accurately capture ice-formation processes, including ice to water column coupling, formation of both blue and white ice layers, and process-based ice and snow parameters (density, conductivity and albedo).																			1129-5767	1723-8633					2014	73	3					441	453		10.4081/jlimnol.2014.903	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2014.903													WOS:000352402900004

The midden sites are along the hyperarid upper margin (2400-3100 m) of the "absolute desert," in an extreme environment sparsely vegetated by annual herbs and halophytic shrubs. Conditions between 40 and 22 ka may have been at least intermittently dry, and possibly cooler, as implied by four middens with low species richness. We infer a large increase in summer rainfall between 16.2 and 10.5 ka on the basis of the lowering of steppe grasses by as much as 1000 m, prominence of C, grasses and summer annuals, high species richness, and displacement of northern species at least 50 kin south of their modern ranges. The precipitation increase was greatest for a cluster of middens between 11.8 and 10.5 ka. Abrupt drying, evident in a dramatic decrease in grass abundance, occurred after 10.5 ka at all four midden localities. Increased percentages of grass, higher species richness, and extralocal taxa record slightly wetter conditions between 7.1 and 3.5 ka. The present hyperarid conditions were established after 3 ka. Present-day variability of summer precipitation in the central Atacama Desert and adjacent Altiplano is related to the intensity and position of upper air circulation anomalies, which in turn respond to Pacific sea-surface temperature anomalies. Summer insolation over the central Andes (lat 20degreesS) was at its minimum during the latest glacial to early Holocene transition, so regional insolation forcing cannot account for intensified pluvial conditions in the central Atacama. Summer precipitation collapsed abruptly between 10.5 and 10 ka, indicating either nonlinear relationships with seasonal insolation or a change in intensity of upper air circulation over the Altiplano, effectively blocking moisture transport to the Atacama Desert. Here, we suggest that precipitation variations on millennial time scales in the central Atacama are the result of extraregional forcing of the South American Summer Monsoon through intensified Walker Circulation (stronger easterlies) and La Nina-like conditions operating through insolation anomalies (i.e., departures in insolation values) directly over central Asia and the equatorial Pacific.

Tracking Late Holocene climate change and the 1908 Tunguska impact event from lake sediments in Central Siberia	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												We studied a 2200-year-old sediment core from Lake Zapovednoye, a small, deep, freshwater lake near the site of the 1908 Tunguska impact event. Analysis of the sediment core for geochemistry, pollen, chironomids, Cladocera, and diatoms revealed traces of climatic fluctuations during the investigated time period during which a cool climate before 1000 CE was replaced by the Medieval Climatic Optimum, the Little Ice Age, and finally the modern warming. An increased content of terrigenous elements was identified at the depth corresponding to ca. 1908 CE. This layer presumably resulted from erosion of the soil cover after the tree fall caused by the Tunguska impact event (the largest recorded in history). For the first time, the reaction of lake biota to an impact event has been detected. Our study has demonstrated that the taxonomic diversity of hydrobionts (chironomids and cladocerans) significantly declined after the catastrophe, probably due to increased turbidity, and recovered in 6-10 years. The pollen and diatom assemblages, however, demonstrated weaker compositional shifts.

Deconvolution of the histories of changing evaporative isotopic enrichment from source water delta(18)O in the lake sediment records is constrained by comparison to the Sajama ice core oxygen isotope profile, whereas local hydrological influence is distinguished from the regional moisture balance history by the response of the different catchments to climate change. Overall, variations in the LP delta(18)O(lw) record appear to be dominantly controlled by evaporative O-18-enrichment, reflecting shifts in local effective moisture. This record is used to generate a preliminary quantitative reconstruction of summer relative humidity spanning the past 11 500 cal yr on the basis of an isotope-mass balance model. Results indicate that the late Pleistocene was moist with summer relative humidity values estimated at 10-20% greater than present, Increasing aridity developed in the early Holocene with maximum prolonged dryness spanning 7500-6000 cal yr BP at LP, an interval characterized by summer relative humidity values that may have been 20% lower than present. Highly variable but dominantly and conditions persist in the mid- to late Holocene, with average summer relative humidity values estimated at 15% below present, which then increase to about 10-20% greater than present by 2000 cal yr BP. Slightly more and conditions characterize the last millennium with summer relative humidity values ranging from 5-10% lower than present. Similar long-term variations are evident in the LTCK delta(18)O(lw) profile, except during the early Holocene when lake water evaporative O-18-enrichment in response to low relative humidity appears to have been offset by enhanced inflow from O-18-depleted snowmelt or groundwater from the large catchment. Although some temporal offset is evident, significant correspondence occurs between the isotope-inferred paleohumidity reconstruction and other paleohydrological proxies from the region. These results support the contention that millennial-scale variations in tropical moisture balance may be linked to changes in summer insolation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

North-south dipole in winter hydroclimate in the western United States during the last deglaciation	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												During the termination of the last glacial period the western U.S. experienced exceptionally wet conditions, driven by changes in location and strength of the mid-latitude winter storm track. The distribution of modern winter precipitation is frequently characterized by a north-south wet/dry dipole pattern, controlled by interaction of the storm track with ocean-atmosphere conditions over the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Here we show that a dipole pattern of similar geographic extent persisted and switched sign during millennial-scale abrupt climate changes of the last deglaciation, based on a new lake level reconstruction for pluvial Lake Chewaucan (northwestern U.S.), and a compilation of regional paleoclimate records. This suggests the dipole pattern is robust, and one mode may be favored for centuries, thereby creating persistent contrasting wet/dry conditions across the western U.S. The TraCE-21k climate model simulation shows an equatorward enhancement of winter storm track activity in the northeastern Pacific, favoring wet conditions in southwestern U.S. during the second half of Heinrich Stadial 1(16.1-14.6 ka) and consistent with paleoclimate evidence. During the Bolling/Allerod (14.6-12.8 ka), the northeastern Pacific storm track contracted poleward, consistent with wetter conditions concentrated poleward toward the northwest U.S.						Hudson, Adam/0000-0002-3387-9838													2045-2322					MAR 18	2019	9								4826	10.1038/s41598-019-41197-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41197-y								30886192					WOS:000461419200007

Investigating groundwater-lake interactions in the Laurentian Great Lakes with a fully-integrated surface water-groundwater model	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Modelling groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) interactions at scales of large river basins is a difficult challenge. In this study, a fully-integrated surface water-groundwater model accounting for hydrologic seasonality is developed for the 766,000 km(2) Laurentian Great Lakes basin, and applied towards the characterization of groundwater-lake (GW-lake) interactions in the five Great Lakes under monthly normal climatology. The simulated annual average rates of direct groundwater discharge to Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie and Ontario through the combined lakebed and 8 km wide band of shoreline surrounding each lake are 29.0, 38.6, 24.5, 11.9, and 11.6 m(3)/s, respectively. Thus, direct groundwater discharge accounts for a small component of positive basin supply; ranging from 0.6% for Lake Ontario to 1.3% for Lake Michigan, with an overall average of 0.8% for all lakes combined. Simulation results demonstrate that GW-lake interactions are strongest nearshore, and vary temporally in response to seasonal fluctuations in both lake levels and terrestrial groundwater levels in nearshore regions. In winter, direct groundwater discharge dominates the GW-lake interactions in both the distal and nearshore lakebed areas. In summer, the combined effects of rising lake levels and lowering terrestrial groundwater levels lead to notable reductions in direct groundwater discharge through nearshore areas. Direct groundwater discharge is also shown to vary spatially, with highest rates associated with areas containing thick Phanerozoic hydrostratigraphy, as opposed to Precambrian basement rock. The results from this study indicate that the Great Lakes primarily act as groundwater receivers, gaining considerable amounts of water directly from the basin's groundwater system.

During summer/fall, zooplankton and phytoplankton densities increased exponentially in the lake and decreased exponentially in the river without major changes in species composition. Both parts of the system can be described as tubular plug flow reactors that differ markedly in the growth rates of plankton. Whereas reproduction in rotifers was constant in the whole system, the mortality was about 10 times higher in the river compared to the lake caused by the filtration activity of abundant mussels. Physiological conditions can be regarded as continuous in the river-lake system. According to trophic conditions, the river-lake system is divided in two contrasting subsystems with the lake classified as `autotrophic' and the river as `heterotrophic' and the site of discontinuity was located sharply at the lake-river transition. At very low discharges, the differences between the subsystems were reduced and intra-pelagic mechanisms became more important. A model of plankton dynamics in the river-lake system is presented.

The study communities were natural plankton communities from Colgada Lake (central Spain), which is heavily polluted by nitrate. Natural delta N-15 in phytoplankton and zooplankton was measured and experiments were performed on the N-15 supply. Naturally derived delta N-15 varied from 7.4 to 8.6 parts per thousand and from 10.0 to 16.8 parts per thousand in phytoplankton and zooplankton respectively. Nitrogen incorporation rates ranged from 0.006 to 0.036 mu Mh(-1) and from 0.0004 to 0.0014 mu Mh(-1) in phytoplankton and zooplankton respectively. The differences in natural d15N levels and nitrogen incorporation rates between plankton fractions from seasonally different communities reported in the present study suggested that the nitrogen uptake by planktonic communities in Colgada Lake depend on different combinations of dominant zooplankters and phytoplankton size structure. A higher level of nitrogen uptake by phytoplankton occurred when small algae were dominant without competitors (larger algae) or main predators (herbivorous zooplankters). This was because copepods, with the lowest zooplankton nitrogen uptake, were dominant. Phytoplankton nitrogen uptake was lower when big algae were dominant.

We performed field surveys along a year in LR and CW to capture different sandbar states (open/closed) and lagoon-sea connectivity processes (e.g. lagoon discharges, marine intrusion, overwashing). Results showed differences in environmental conditions and ichthyoplankton communities between LR and CW, and also evidenced different mechanisms of exchange of water and ichthyoplankton. At least three estuarine species were found to spawn and use LR as a nursery ground. Larval stages of six marine species were found at CW. Environmental factors (e.g. wind and runoff) and species-specific traits (e.g. life cycle strategy, spawning season) determined ichthyoplankton exchange vs. retention. Marine estuarine-related species entered LR mostly during summer-autumn, at their peak abundance in CW. Sandbar closure did not impede the entrance of these species. Overwashing events (closed bar) and light onshore winds during the open-sandbar period were the most important process that promoted the transport of these larvae into LR. Conversely, there was no evidence of entrance of marine estuarine-independent larvae to LR. Eggs and larvae of estuarine species that spawned within LR were effectively retained there, except when heavy rains led to severe lagoon discharges. Similarly, unusual strong onshore winds advected eggs from CW to LR, possibly reducing their survival. Generally, eggs were more vulnerable to drift than larvae. Many of the estuarine larvae that drifted out of the lagoon seemed to survive, suggesting a loss of individuals from the lagoon population but a potential contribution to the genetic flux among coastal populations.					; Calliari, Danilo/ABN-2652-2022	Lescano, Carolina/0000-0001-5258-080X; Machado, Irene/0000-0001-5514-582X; Calliari Cuadro, Danilo Luis/0000-0002-4752-1669; 													0272-7714	1096-0015				OCT 31	2021	261								107549	10.1016/j.ecss.2021.107549	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2021.107549		SEP 2021											WOS:000704737300004

We studied the responses to changing environmental conditions of five halophytes (Sarcocornia fruticosa, Inula crithmoides, Plantago crassifolia, Juncus maritimus and J. acutus) in a Mediterranean salt marsh, from summer 2009 to autumn 2010. A principal component analysis was used to correlate soil and climatic data with changes in the plants' contents of chemical markers associated with stress responses: ions, osmolytes, malondialdehyde (MDA, a marker of oxidative stress) and antioxidant systems. Stress tolerance in S. fruticosa, I. crithmoides and P. crassifolia (all succulent dicots) seemed to depend mostly on the transport of ions to aerial parts and the biosynthesis of specific osmolytes, whereas both Juncus species (monocots) were able to avoid accumulation of toxic ions, maintaining relatively high K+/Na+ ratios. For the most salt-tolerant taxa (S. fruticosa and I. crithmoides), seasonal variations of Na+, Cl-, K+ and glycine betaine, their major osmolyte, did not correlate with environmental parameters associated with salt or water stress, suggesting that their tolerance mechanisms are constitutive and relatively independent of external conditions, although they could be mediated by changes in the subcellular compartmentalization of ions and compatible osmolytes. Proline levels were too low in all the species to possibly have any effect on osmotic adjustment. However-except for P. crassifolia-proline may play a role in stress tolerance based on its 'osmoprotectant' functions. No correlation was observed between the degree of environmental stress and the levels of MDA or enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, indicating that the investigated halophytes are not subjected to oxidative stress under natural conditions and do not, therefore, need to activate antioxidant defence mechanisms.

J	Shi, YF; Lou, YS; Zhang, YW; Xu, ZF				Shi, Yifan; Lou, Yunsheng; Zhang, Yiwei; Xu, Zufei			Quantitative contributions of climate change, new cultivars adoption, and management practices to yield and global warming potential in rice-winter wheat rotation ecosystems	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												Context: With the growing demand for food and the threat from climate change, increasing grain yields with lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is an important target. Yet, the quantitative effects of climate change and management practices on yield and global warming potential (GWP) of rice-winter wheat rotations are still uncertain. Objective: To investigate the key factors influencing the tradeoffs between yield and GHG of rice-winter wheat ecosystems in mid-eastern China over the two periods. Methods: In this study, the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model was used to examine the spatiotemporal county-scale variations in yields of rice-winter wheat rotations and associated GHG (CH4, N2O) and GHG intensity (GHGI) over two periods (1980?1989, 2010?2019) in mid-eastern China. The DNDC model is driven by a county-scale database, consisting of meteorological data (79 stations), soil properties, management practice, and crop parameters for 213 counties. Eight scenarios were defined to isolate the individual and combined impacts of climate change, new cultivars adoption, and management practices on yields, GWP, and GHGI. Results and conclusions: Results revealed that the total yield increased by 48.7% over the two periods but stagnated in the 2010s; the average emission rate of CH4 and N2O in the two periods were 250.7, 196, 0.63 and 2.83 kg ha- 1, respectively, while GWP and GHGI declined by 12.8% and 38.3%. The individual contributions of climate change, new cultivars adoption, and management practices to the GHGI of the rice-winter wheat rotations were 37%, -42.5%, and 16.4%, respectively. Adoption of new cultivars was a decisive factor for improving yields and mitigating GHG, while climate change and management practices had a minor influence on yields. The negative responses of yield to improved management practices (i.e., high N fertilization, mid-season drainage) were mainly attributed to soil organic carbon (SOC) and bulk density variations and different fertilization patterns. The combination of new cultivars adoption and management practices decreased GHGI by 46.6%. These findings demonstrate the importance of high-yield crop varieties to low carbon agriculture, and that management practices should be adapted to local conditions and specific crop varieties. Significance: Given that the crop harvest index is approaching its theoretical upper limit and that promoting new varieties presents many challenges, future innovations should focus on introducing optimal strategies that balance the tradeoffs between yield and GHG emissions to mitigate the negative effects of climate change on agriculture.

Tundra burning in Alaska: Linkages to climatic change and sea ice retreat	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Recent climatic warming has resulted in pronounced environmental changes in the Arctic, including shrub cover expansion and sea ice shrinkage. These changes foreshadow more dramatic impacts that will occur if the warming trend continues. Among the major challenges in anticipating these impacts are "surprises" stemming from changes in system components that have remained relatively stable in the historic record. Tundra burning is potentially one such component. Here we report paleoecological evidence showing that recent tundra burning is unprecedented in the central Alaskan Arctic within the last 5000 years. Analysis of lake sediment cores reveals peak values of charcoal accumulation corresponding to the Anaktuvuk River Fire in 2007, with no evidence of other fire events throughout the past five millennia in that area. Atmospheric reanalysis suggests that the fire was favored by exceptionally warm and dry weather conditions in summer and early autumn. Boosted regression tree modeling shows that such conditions also explain 95% of the interannual variability in tundra area burned throughout Alaska over the past 60 years and that the response of tundra burning to climatic warming is nonlinear. These results contribute to an emerging body of evidence suggesting that tundra ecosystems can burn more frequently under suitable climatic and fuel conditions. The Anaktuvuk River Fire coincides with extreme sea ice retreat, and tundra area burned in Alaska is moderately correlated with sea ice extent from 1979 to 2009 (r = -0.43, p (-) 0.02). Recurrences of large tundra fires as a result of sea ice disappearance may represent a novel manifestation of coupled marine-terrestrial responses to climatic warming.					; Higuera, Philip/B-1330-2010	Walsh, John/0000-0001-9541-5927; Higuera, Philip/0000-0001-5396-9956													2169-8953	2169-8961				OCT 5	2010	115								G04002	10.1029/2009JG001270	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009JG001270													WOS:000282768500005

PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												We present a reconstruction of environmental changes from sediments of high-altitude Laguna Chepical in the subtropical Andes of Central Chile (32 degrees 16'S; 70 degrees 30'W, 3050 ma.s.l.) for the past 3100 years. Based on subfossil pollen, microscopic charcoal and diatoms, we inferred changes in moisture (related to precipitation) and ice-cover/ice-free season (related to summer temperature) at decadal to millennial scales. Sustained wetter and colder summer temperatures than today prevailed between 1100 BC and ca. AD 1. Afterward, decreasing pollen accumulation rates and increased fire activity suggest drier conditions and possibly enhanced seasonality and/or inter-annual climate variability. Frequent changes between cold and warm summers were observed, particularly for the last 1000 years. About AD 1250 (during the Medieval Climate Anomaly), wet years and early break up of ice-cover occurred in central Chile, which is today typical for El Nifio-like mean conditions. Conversely, and with the exception of a few wet pulses, a generally dry period with extended ice-cover (cool summers) was observed between AD 1400 and AD 1850 (Little Ice Age). This can be interpreted as a trend toward more La Nina-like mean conditions. Recent climate change and human disturbances during the last 100 years have prompted changes in diatom and plant communities that are unprecedented in the late Holocene. First, planktonic diatoms increased as a result of hydraulic interventions in the lake during the late 19th century, and secondly, the Andean vegetation shifted upward as result of recent warming, and the frequency of arboreal taxa was significantly reduced. At the same time peaks of fire activity were observed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Winder, M; Schindler, DE				Winder, M; Schindler, DE			Climate change uncouples trophic interactions in an aquatic ecosystem	ECOLOGY												The largest uncertainty in forecasting the effects of climate change on ecosystems is in understanding how it will affect the nature of interactions among species. Climate change may have unexpected consequences because different species show unique responses to changes in environmental temperatures. Here we show that increasingly warmer springs since 1962 have disrupted the trophic linkages between phytoplankton and zoo-plankton in a large temperate lake because of differing sensitivity to vernal warming. The timing of thermal stratification and the spring diatom bloom have advanced by more than 20 days during this time period. A long-term decline in Daphnia populations, the keystone herbivore, is associated with an expanding temporal mismatch with the spring diatom bloom and may have severe consequences for resource flow to upper trophic levels.

Despite their different conservation status, the four cranes have substantial ecological niche overlap and often form mixed flocks in their wintering grounds. To understand the persistence and coexistence of the species, we used time-budgeting to investigate how these sympatric cranes allocate time to their activities. Our results indicate that the cranes had more foraging time and less vigilance time at Poyang Lake than at other wintering sites. Also, the four cranes displayed significantly different activity patterns in the shared habitat. Compared with the smaller sized Common Cranes and Hooded Cranes, the larger sized Siberian Cranes and White-naped Cranes tended to be more relaxed, suggesting foraging ability decides the crane community structure as evidenced in many ecosystems. Our results suggested that Poyang Lake is crucial for the cranes conservation, which needs a transregional even global management strategy.

Historically the species was more widely distributed throughout the floodplain but now most of the population is confined to five wetlands in Anhui Province and to Poyang Lake in Jiangxi Province, where the majority (up to 113,000 birds) occur. Within-winter counts suggest that swans congregate at Poyang Lake before dispersing to other sites later in the winter. Counts show large between-year fluctuations, but suggest declines at Shengjin and Fengsha Lakes (both in Anhui) during the last five years. Declines at Shengjin Lake are likely due to decreases in submerged vegetation (particularly tuber-producing Vallisneria, a major food item) perhaps linked to eutrophication. Range contractions throughout the floodplain may also be linked to reductions in submerged vegetation coverage elsewhere. Changes in water quality and lake hydrology post-Three Gorges Dam may have adversely affected submerged vegetation productivity. Key information needs for the effective implementation of conservation measures for Tundra Swans include: (1) annual surveys of all major wintering sites throughout each winter to establish the importance of different sites during the non-breeding period; (2) more information on swan diets at important sites; and (3) an assessment of adverse effects of water quality and lake water levels post-Three Gorges Dam on submerged vegetation productivity at Poyang Lake and other important sites.					; Rees, Eileen/I-5835-2019; Rees, Eileen/GZM-7164-2022; Fox, Anthony/I-7465-2013	Cao, Lei/0000-0002-1157-0303; Rees, Eileen/0000-0002-2247-3269; 													0959-2709	1474-0001				SEP	2011	21	3					260	265		10.1017/S0959270911000098	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0959270911000098													WOS:000295871800002

The gamma (gamma) ray spectra of the collected soil samples and some of the soils amended with Sr-85 and Cs-137 were measured. The data indicate that the arable soils from Sanhsing series, Sanhsing Township and Chuangwei series, Chuangwei Township, Ilan County, and from Tunglochuan series, Pinglin Township, Taipei County shows significantly higher radioactivity of Cs-137 ( ND - 11.0 +/- 0.2 Bq kg(-1)). Furthermore, the radioactivity of Cs-137 in the mountain soils ( 1.24 +/- 0.07 - 42 +/- 1 Bq kg(-1)) from Yuanyang Lake Nature Preserve among Ilan, Taoyuan, and Hsinchu Counties is the highest among the investigated mountain forest soils. This may be mainly attributed to the fact that Ilan County is located in the northeastern part of Taiwan and faces the northeastern and northern seasonal winds with lots of precipitation annually from mid-autumn through mid-spring next year and is receiving greater amount of fallouts yearly. Due to longer reaction period (> 3 y) of Cs-137 with soil components, Cs-137 was mainly in the forms bound to oxides and to organic matter in the soil amended with Cs-137 and in the soil contaminated with Cs-137. On the contrary, due to shorter reaction period (< 60 d) of Sr-85 with soil components, Sr-85 was mainly in exchangeable form and partially in the forms bound to carbonates and oxides in the soils amended with Sr-85.

The Effects of Three Chemical Algaecides on Cell Numbers and Toxin Content of the Cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa and Anabaenopsis sp.	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Toxic cyanobacteria blooms are a growing concern for public health and safety, due in part to the production of the hepatotoxin microcystin by certain species, including Microcystis aeruginosa. Management strategies for controlling cyanobacteria blooms include algaecide treatments, often with copper sulfate, and more recently oxidizers such as sodium percarbonate that produce hydrogen peroxide. This study assessed the effects of two copper-containing algaecides and one sodium percarbonate-containing algaecide on mitigating cell numbers and toxin content of cultured M. aeruginosa and summer (July) bloom samples of Anabaenopsis sp. in a brackish stormwater detention pond. Monitoring of the bloom revealed that Anabaenopsis sp. was associated with elevated levels of orthophosphate compared to nitrogen (dissolved inorganic nitrogen to phosphorus ratios were 0.19-1.80), and the bloom decline (September-October) was likely due to lower autumn water temperatures combined with potential grazing by the dinoflagellate Protoperidinium quinquecorne. Laboratory-based algaecide experiments included three dose levels, and cyanobacteria cell numbers and microcystin concentrations (particulate and dissolved) were evaluated over 7 d. Following exposure, copper-containing treatments generally had lower cell numbers than either sodium percarbonate-containing or control (no algaecide) treatments. Addition of algaecides did not reduce overall microcystin levels, and a release of toxin from the particulate to dissolved phase was observed in most treatments. These findings indicate that algaecide applications may visibly control cyanobacteria bloom densities, but not necessarily toxin concentrations, and have implications for public health and safety.					; White, David/ACY-4325-2022	Wilde, Susan/0000-0002-5388-9582; White, David/0000-0002-9063-4538; 													0364-152X	1432-1009				NOV	2014	54	5					1110	1120		10.1007/s00267-014-0339-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-014-0339-2								25078538					WOS:000344387800012

Characterization of non-Gaussianity in the snow distributions of various landscapes	CRYOSPHERE												Seasonal snowpack is an important predictor of the water resources available in the following spring and early-summer melt season. Total basin snow water equivalent (SWE) estimation usually requires a form of statistical analysis that is implicitly built upon the Gaussian framework. However, it is important to characterize the non-Gaussian properties of snow distribution for accurate large-scale SWE estimation based on remotely sensed or sparse ground-based observations. This study quantified non-Gaussianity using sample negentropy; the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the Gaussian distribution for field-observed snow depth data from the North Slope, Alaska; and three representative SWE distributions in the western USA from the Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO). Snowdrifts around lakeshore cliffs and deep gullies can bring moderate non-Gaussianity in the open, lowland tundra of North Slope, Alaska, while the ASO dataset suggests that subalpine forests may effectively suppress the non-Gaussianity of snow distribution. Thus, non-Gaussianity is found in areas with partial snow cover and wind-induced snowdrifts around topographic breaks on slopes and on other steep terrain features. The snowpacks may be considered weakly Gaussian in coastal regions with open tundra in Alaska and alpine and subalpine terrains in the western USA if the land is completely covered by snow. The wind-induced snowdrift effect can potentially be partitioned from the observed snow spatial distribution guided by its Gaussianity.					; Rangel, Rodrigo Correa/GRS-5496-2022; Correa Rangel, Rodrigo/GRS-5496-2022; Perdigão, Rui/K-9896-2015	Perdigao, Rui A.

Phytoplankton growth dynamics in offshore Lake Erie during mid-winter	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The phytoplanlcton community in offshore Lake Erie in mid-winter was active but little net growth was occurring which suggests that high reported accumulations of phytoplankton in this lake in February are likely the product of previous bloom conditions. We measured phytoplankton dynamics as size-specific growth and loss rates of phytoplankton using dilution assays and antibiotic assays in ice-covered offshore waters of Lake Erie during the mid-winter period in 2008, 2009, and 2010. Total chlorophyll-a specific rates (average +/- standard deviation) measured using dilution assays for growth ([0.72 +/- 0.35/(11) and loss ([0.98 +/- 0.36/d]) were closely matched. Growth and loss rates of picocyanobacteria determined using an antibiotic technique ranged from -0.10 to 1.22/d and -0.11 to -2.35/d, respectively. The results indicate a trend of higher grazing rate than growth rate but that this difference is not significantly different from zero, suggesting a state of phytoplankton population size equilibrium at this time of year in the waters sampled.

Versatile photophysiology of compositionally similar cyanobacterial mat communities inhabiting submerged sinkholes of Lake Huron	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Recently discovered submerged sinkholes in Lake Huron are high-sulfur, low-oxygen extreme environments for microbial life. In order to understand the relationship between the physical environment, photophysiology and community composition, we measured the physical conditions, photophysiological indices, and genetic diversity at 3 microbial mat sites bathed in high conductivity groundwater under a natural light gradient during 2012 and 2013. A strong seasonal trend prevailed at all sites, characterized by decreased photosynthetic yield (F-v'/F-m'; 0.25 to 0.40) during the summer (April to August) and increased yield (0.70 to 0.75) during the winter (November to March). Chlorophyll a content varied seasonally in a similar manner to photo synthetic yield. All sites were dominated by >80% abundance of one cyanobacterial group, most closely related to Phormidium sp. Phycobilins (phycocyanin and phycoerythrin) were consistently higher in concentration than chlorophyll. Photosynthetic yield was statistically indistinguishable between sites, suggesting that these mat communities are able to acclimate across a wide range of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Interestingly, these cyanobacteria carried out oxygenic photosynthesis in the presence of in vitro H2S, further suggestive of their versatile photophysiologies under variable redox conditions. Collectively, our study provides insight into the adaptive capabilities of cyanobacteria by revealing how they photophysiologically respond to changes in light climate and redox conditions, and are thereby able to inhabit a wide range of physico-chemical environments. Such versatile physiologies may have enabled their ancestors to thrive across a range of habitats on early Earth.

J	Li, X; Hu, BS; Qi, SH; Luo, J				Li, Xin; Hu, Bisong; Qi, Shuhua; Luo, Jin			The Influence of Short-Term Water Level Fluctuations on the Habitat Response and Ecological Fragility of Siberian Cranes in Poyang Lake, China	REMOTE SENSING												The landscape of the Poyang Lake wetland is significantly influenced by changes in water levels, impacting the distribution of habitats for migratory birds. While long-term effects of water level variations have been extensively studied, short-term impacts on Siberian crane habitats and their ecological vulnerability remain poorly understood. This study utilized 35 years (1987-2022) of Landsat remote sensing data and daily water level records from Poyang Lake to examine the effects of short-term water level fluctuations on the spatial distribution and ecological vulnerability of Siberian crane habitats. The geographic detector method was employed to quantify the explanatory power and interaction effects of factors, including short-term water level fluctuations, on ecological vulnerability. The findings reveal significant differences in the habitats of wintering Siberian cranes across various water level intervals and short-term fluctuation patterns. Short-term water level fluctuations can result in the largest suitable wintering habitat area for Siberian cranes, reaching 1856.41 km2 in this study. These habitats are highly sensitive to short-term water level changes, with rising and falling trends potentially leading to habitat loss. Oscillating water levels in the short term create broader and more concentrated habitats. Notably, fluctuations at low water levels support the sustainability and stability of crane habitats. Furthermore, short-term water level trends and nature reserves play a critical role in maintaining habitat ecological vulnerability; well-managed and protected nature reserves exhibit significant explanatory power, both in single-factor analysis and in their interaction with other environmental factors. Specifically, these protected areas show explanatory power exceeding the 20% threshold for both water level fluctuations and ranges, highlighting the crucial role of anthropogenic management in mitigating ecological vulnerability. This study emphasizes the necessity of scientifically informed regulation of short-term water level fluctuations to protect Siberian crane habitats and provides a strong scientific basis for decision-making support.																				2072-4292				DEC	2024	16	23							4431	10.3390/rs16234431	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16234431													WOS:001377633200001

Invertebrates, including Dreissenid mussels, are major diving duck prey items that can transfer some trace elements, such as selenium (Se) to higher trophic levels. Se can be problematic for waterfowl and it often has been detected at elevated levels in organisms using the Great Lakes. There are, however, few data on hepatic Se concentrations in sea ducks, particularly during the winter at Lake Ontario. In this study, we evaluated interspecific differences and temporal trends in hepatic Se concentrations among BUFF (n = 77), COGO (n = 77), and LTDU (n = 79) wintering at Lake Ontario. All three species accumulated Se throughout winter, but COGO did so at a higher rate than did BUFF and LTDU. Overall, Se concentrations were higher in LTDU [(x) over bar = 22: 7; 95% CI = 20.8-24.8 mu g/g dry weight (dw)] than in BUFF ((x) over bar = 12: 3; 95% CI = 11.6-13.1 mu g/g dw) and COGO ((x) over bar = 12: 0; 95% CI = 10.7-3.5 mu g/g dw) throughout the winter. Se concentrations were deemed elevated (>33 mu g/g dw) in 0%, 5%, and 19% of BUFF, COGO, and LTDU, respectively. Presently there are no data on Se toxicity end points for these species, so it is unclear how acquiring concentrations of these magnitudes affect their short-and long-term health or reproduction.

Limnological characteristics of Missouri reservoirs: synthesis of a long-term assessment	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Jones JR, Thorpe AP, Obrecht DV. 2020. Limnological characteristics of Missouri reservoirs: synthesis of a long-term assessment. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XX-XX. Missouri reservoirs reflect their edaphic location in the midcontinent ecotone between historic prairies and forests. Most are small (median surface area of 28 ha) but provide essential services in a region with few natural lakes. Long-term summer monitoring data (1978-2016) show that they span the full trophic state range, with oligotrophic reservoirs in deep, forested valleys and eutrophic-hypereutrophic impoundments in agricultural regions. In regression analysis, row crop (a surrogate for agricultural nutrient loss) along with depth and flushing rate accounted for some two-thirds of variation among reservoir nutrients. Hydrology is a strong influence; total phosphorus (TP) effectively doubles between flushing rates of 0.25/yr and 2/yr when holding land cover and depth constant. Temporal variation characterizes these impoundments; many show >3-fold range in mean summer trophic state metrics, which is influenced by the volume and timing of annual inflow. This variation may mask gradual nutrient-driven changes in trophic state; based on simulation, doubling chlorophyll (Chl) in a given lake over 20 yr could be undetectable with routine summer monitoring. Some two-thirds of cross-system variation in mean Chl was explained by TP, and inorganic solids further reduced variation (negative coefficient). On average, Chl:TP ratios increased from 0.28 to 0.48 during summer, coincident with a decline in inorganic solids. Inorganic particulates largely determine Secchi transparency and can result in light limitation of phytoplankton. Small reservoirs cover nearly double the area of major impoundments worldwide and are known for an intensity of ecological processes, making this information relevant beyond the region.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				OCT 1	2020	36	4					412	422		10.1080/10402381.2020.1756997	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2020.1756997		MAY 2020											WOS:000540358600001

Hydrological modeling of the pipestone creek watershed using the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT): Assessing impacts of wetland drainage on hydrology	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: Prairie Pothole Region of North America. Study focus: The Prairie Pothole Region of North America has experienced extensive wetland drainage, potentially impacting peak flows and annual flow volumes. Some of this drainage has occurred in closed basins, possibly impacting lake water levels of these systems. In this study we investigated the potential impact of wetland drainage on peak flows and annual volumes in a 2242 km(2) watershed located in southeastern Saskatchewan (Canada) using the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. New hydrological insights: The SWAT model, which had been calibrated and validated at daily and monthly time steps for the 1997-2009 period, was used to assess the impact of wetland drainage using three hypothetical scenarios that drained 15, 30, and 50% of the non-contributing drainage area. Results of these simulations suggested that drainage increased spring peak flows by about 50, 79 and 113%, respectively while annual flow volumes increased by about 43, 68, and 98% in each scenario. Years that were wetter than normal presented increased peak flows and annual flow volumes below the average of the simulated period. Alternatively, summer peak flows presented smaller increases in terms of percentages during the simulated period.

By using both the deposition rate of atmospheric nitrate onto the entire surface of the lake and the influx/efflux of both atmospheric and remineralized nitrate via streams reported in the literature, we quantified the annual dynamics of nitrate (gross production rate of nitrate through nitrification and gross metabolic rate of nitrate through assimilation and denitrification), together with their seasonal variations, based on the Delta O-17 method. The results revealed that 642 +/- 113 Mmol (Mmol = 10(6) mol) of the remineralized nitrate was supplied into the water column through nitrification in the lake on an annual basis, while 810 +/- 120 Mmol of nitrate was metabolized in the lake through assimilation and denitrification. In addition, it turns out that nitrification was active, not only in the hypolimnion, but also in the epilimnion and upper thermocline in this lake. Furthermore, the total metabolic rates of nitrate varied seasonally, with the highest rates in summer and the lowest in winter. Because the difference between the annual metabolic rate of nitrate estimated based on the Delta O-17 method and the annual assimilation rate of nitrate estimated based on the traditional N-15 incubation method was only 20%, we concluded that the Delta O-17 method reliably estimates the dynamics of nitrate in mesotrophic lakes.

Hence, the depositional characteristics and the nature of FPOM are of interest to remediation. Our objectives were firstly, to determine interactions between allochthonous FPOM and water affected by mine drainage and secondly, to verify the consequence on particle fall velocity, a major factor in particle distribution in streams and lakes. In laboratory experiments we studied interactions between particles (shredded leaves) and two types of post-mining water (very acidic, pH 3.7; extremely acidic, pH 2.9). Particle fall velocity was assessed by gravity sedimentation analysis. Suspended particles released minerals (1 mass%) and organic compounds (10 mass%) within 25 h. Fe3+ was quickly reduced to Fe2+ in aerobic conditions by organic reductants. Most of the iron attached to the particles (88% in very acidic and 71% in extremely acidic water) when the particle concentration was high. The median particle fall velocity was in acidic, iron-rich water up to 3 times higher than in distilled water. We assume particle aggregation in the highly mineralised water to be the reason for the increase in particle fall velocity. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Gavin, DG; McLachlan, JS; Brubaker, LB; Young, KA				Gavin, DG; McLachlan, JS; Brubaker, LB; Young, KA			Postglacial history of subalpine forests, Olympic Peninsula, Washington, USA	HOLOCENE												To investigate subalpine vegetation history on the Olympic Peninsula, Washington (USA), two pollen, macrofossil and charcoal records were studied in climatically distinct zones: Martins Lake (1415 m) in the moist Tsuga mertensiana zone and Moose Lake (1508 m) in the drier Abies lasiocarpa zone. The interpretation of fossil pollen assemblages was aided by comparisons with 308 modern assemblages from the Olympic Peninsula and western North America. Both pollen records show a cold/dry period following deglaciation (>10000 radiocarbon years BP) with sparse tundra and little similarity to any modern pollen assemblage. In the early Holocene, when summer temperatures are thought to have been higher than present, high percentages of Alnus sinuata-type pollen at both lakes suggest increased avalanche activity. At Martins Lake warmer summers were not accompanied by forest establishment, possibly because persistent spring snow pack, snow avalanches, and/or edaphic constraints limited tree establishment at this site. The Martins Lake record shows a steplike shift in vegetation to modern Tsuga mertensiana/Abies amabilis parkland across the Mazama tephra (6730 BP). In contrast to Martins Lake, Abies lasiocarpa forest quickly established at Moose Lake in the early Holocene, though forests were probably initially open and fires may have been frequent. From 7800 to 5100 BP forests near Moose Lake shifted gradually to cooler and moister species composition, with the addition of Chamaecyparis nootkatensis, Tsuga mertensiana and Pinus, though Abies lasiocarpa remained dominant. Forest cover was probably greatest during this transition, with parklike conditions at Moose Lake beginning at c. 5100 BP. The major differences in the records between the two sites may be due to differences in the local expression of regional climatic change and/or differences in soil development and stabilization.					; Gavin, Daniel/C-9214-2009	Gavin, Daniel/0000-0001-8743-3949; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				MAR	2001	11	2					177	188		10.1191/095968301670879949	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/095968301670879949													WOS:000167169700004

The sampling period covered late summer months (August and September) and fall months (October to December). Changes in the water conditions were found to influence species composition, which in turn had an effect on the shapes and amplitudes of the action and absorption spectra of phytoplankton, and on the maximum quantum yield of photosynthesis. The most remarkable change was observed in October during a bloom of Mesodinium rubrum, a ciliate harbouring photosynthetic endosymbionts rich in phycobilins. The presence of M. rubrum yielded atypical shapes of the measured photosynthetic action spectra; furthermore, other photosynthesis properties changed significantly. These results demonstrate that the presence of certain pigments in the water column may be associated with a marked shift from what may be considered typical (representative) photosynthesis properties of phytoplankton.																			0142-7873					JUL	2002	24	7					687	702		10.1093/plankt/24.7.687	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/24.7.687													WOS:000176909500006

Increasing soil salinity has caused wide-spread loss of forested wetlands in the areas. Recently, the discharge of secondarily treated municipal effluent into the northeastern EJW as part of the Hammond wetland assimilation project has focused attention on the area (i.e., Bodker et al., 2015). In response, we carried out a number of studies at the Hammond Assimilation Wetlands (HAW) detailed in Shaffer et al. (2015), as well as a series of hydrological measurements and modeling detailed here. These data show that drainage under the railroad was minimal and most flow through the wetlands was to the southeast. Water levels in the HAW were highly variable prior to the beginning of effluent discharge in 2006, with relatively high mean water levels that did not increase substantially from 2007 through summer 2009 despite the addition of municipal effluent. Following effluent addition, surface water levels lacked the variability of the pre-discharge period and mean water levels were about 20 cm higher from late 2009 until 2014 due to high rainfall in 2009, 2012, and 2013 and high effluent inflow due to significant infiltration into the city collection system. Historical net watershed inputs averaged 2.69 cm yr(-1) if this volume of water were spread over the 4 km(2) area immediately south of the effluent distribution system, compared to 0.38 cm yr(-1) for the effluent and 0.13 cm yr(-1) for direct precipitation. Salinity records from five sites in the EJW showed a gradient of increasing salinity from north to south and strong seasonality, averaging 1.9-2.1 PSU near the lake to 0.4-0.6 PSU in the northwestern EJW. Peak salinities were 4.6-5.1 PSU near the lake and 1.8 PSU in northwestern EJW. There was also a significant decrease in salinity over time. Salinity was lower beginning in 2010 coinciding with the closure of the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, high precipitation in the fall and winter of 2009, and in 2012 and 2013, and continuing operation of the assimilation system. Proposed plans to alternate effluent discharge between east and west Joyce wetlands should increase surface water depth variability as seen prior to effluent discharge and minimize salinity intrusion in both areas.

Physical and chemical consequences of artificially deepened thermocline in a small humic lake - a paired whole-lake climate change experiment	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Climate change with higher air temperatures and changes in cloud cover, radiation and wind speed alters the heat balance and stratification patterns of lakes. A paired whole-lake thermocline manipulation experiment of a small (0.047 km(2)) shallow dystrophic lake (Halsjarvi) was carried out in southern Finland. A thermodynamic model (MyLake) was used for both predicting the impacts of climate change scenarios and for determining the manipulation target of the experiment. The model simulations assuming several climate change scenarios indicated large increases in the whole-lake monthly mean temperature (+1.4-4.4 degrees C in April-October for the A2 scenario), and shortening of the length of the ice covered period by 56-89 days. The thermocline manipulation resulted in large changes in the thermodynamic properties of the lake, and those were rather well consistent with the simulated future increases in the heat content during the summer-autumn season. The manipulation also resulted in changes in the oxygen stratification, and the expansion of the oxic water layer increased the spatial extent of the sediment surface oxic-anoxic interfaces. In addition, the experiment affected several other chemical constituents; concentrations of organic carbon, TotN, and NH(4) showed a statistically significant decrease, likely due to both changes in hydrological conditions during the experiment period and increased decomposition and sedimentation. In comparison with the results of a similar whole-lake manipulation experiment in a deep, oligotrophic, clear-watered lake in Norway, it is evident that shallow dystrophic lakes, common in the boreal region, are more sensitive to physical perturbations. This means that projected climate change may modify their physical and chemical conditions in the future.

Geoffrey			Seasonal nearshore sediment resuspension and water clarity at Lake Tahoe	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Motivated by management challenges due to declining water clarity at Lake Tahoe, California-Nevada, we synthesized field observations and modeling of wind-driven nearshore sediment resuspension to inform decision-makers. We present the first field observations of nearshore sediment resuspension in both summer and winter and investigate seasonal differences in lake behavior. In addition, using a previously modified and validated wind-wave model, STWAVE, we developed management charts that illustrate relationships between fetch, wind intensity, and wave height and between water depth, wave height, and the potential for mobilization of different-sized particles. For a representative grain size of 150 mu m, the wind-driven surface waves were found to influence the sediments to a maximum water depth of 9 m. Additionally, we evaluated the potential for wind-driven nearshore sediment resuspension with changing lake levels, considering a range of possible future scenarios. The a real extent of potential wind-driven sediment resuspension in Lake Tahoe's southern nearshore zone is maximum (8.3 km(2)) at a lake water level equal to the natural rim (1897 m). The potential for resuspension notwithstanding, the results demonstrated no increase in particle loading of the size class identified to most negatively impact water clarity (< 16 mu m). Therefore, we corroborate previous findings and conclude that wind-driven nearshore sediment resuspension does not contribute to the declining water clarity of Lake Tahoe and attribute this to a lack of available fine material within the lake sediments.

After a fish kill of 1991, different fish communities developed in the Kazetta and the outer area of the Kis-Balaton reservoir. In the outer area of the reservoir, the densities of plankton feeding fish species were considerably higher than in the Kazetta. These differences induced changes in the structure and dynamics of the cladoceran plankton. The biomass of small-bodied cladocerans (mainly Bosmina longispina) was higher and the biomass of the large-bodied cladocerans (D. hyalina, D. magna) was lower in the western and eastern part of Kis-Balaton reservoir than in the Kazetta. A peak in cladoceran biomass in the Kis-Balaton reservoir was observed during the summer, close or during a bloom of filamentous cyanobacteria, whereas in the Kazetta a peak was observed during the spring, before the bloom of cyanobacteria. The adult females of D. hyalina were larger and produced more eggs in the Kazetta than in the outer area of the reservoir.

Objectives To explore SOB diversity, distribution, and physicochemical drivers in five volcanic lakes and two springs in the Wudalianchi volcanic field, China. Methods This study analyzed microbial communities in samples via high-throughput sequencing of the soxB gene. Physical-chemical parameters were measured, and QIIME 2 (v2019.4), R, Vsearch, MEGA7, and Mothur processed the data. Alpha diversity indices and UPGMA clustering assessed community differences, while heat maps visualized intra-sample variations. Canoco 5.0 analyzed community-environment correlations, and NMDS, Adonis, and PcoA explored sample dissimilarities and environmental factor correlations. SPSS v.18.0 tested for statistical significance. Results The diversity of SOB in surface water was higher than in springs (more than 7.27 times). We detected SOB affiliated to beta-proteobacteria (72.3 %), alpha-proteobacteria (22.8 %), and gamma-proteobacteria (4.2 %) distributed widely in these lakes and springs. Rhodoferax and Cupriavidus were most frequent in all water samples, while Rhodoferax and Bradyrhizobium are dominant in surface waters but rare in springs. SOB genera in both habitats were positively correlated. Co-occurrence analysis identified Bradyrhizobium, Blastochloris, Methylibium, and Metyhlobacterium as potential keystone taxa. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed positive correlations between SOB diversity and total carbon (TC), Fe2+, and total nitrogen (TN) in all water samples. Conclusion The diversity and community structure of SOB in volcanic lakes and springs in the Wudalianchi volcanic group were clarified. Moreover, the diversity and abundance of SOB decreased with the variation of water openness, from open lakes to semi-enclosed lakes and enclosed lakes.

Todd; Thibeau, John			Assessment of Tire-Additive Transformation Product 6PPD-Quinone in Urban-Impacted Watersheds	ACS ES&T WATER												Urban stormwater is a conduit for pollutants such as nutrients and tire-wear compounds through streams to the Great Lakes receiving waters. The transformation product of tire antiozonant 6PPD, 6PPD-quinone (6PPD-Q), is implicated in causing fish mortality. Urban streams entering Lake Ontario and waters adjacent to urban centers in Toronto and Hamilton, Ontario, were assessed for 6PPD-Q and its potential to impact aquatic life. Sampling occurred during fall and spring dry- and wet-weather flows in 2021-2022, overlapping with fish spawning times. Concentrations of 6PPD-Q were elevated during wet-weather (maximum 82 ng/L) in streams with the greatest degree of urbanization and road density but were much lower (2.4-4.5 ng/L) in nearshore waters, suggesting rapid dilution. Precipitation, road density within watersheds, chloride (from road salts), and total phosphorus were correlated with 6PPD-Q concentrations, suggesting that such parameters may provide a means to identify and prioritize key stream habitats for further assessment. A screening level hazard assessment using application factors of 10-1000 and available toxicity end points for fish (rainbow trout, brook trout, coho salmon) showed that 6PPD-Q concentrations may pose a risk in urban streams and nearshore waters of the region. We recommend that stormwater quality control measures be assessed for their effectiveness in reducing 6PPD-Q concentrations.					; Helm, Paul/ABC-1534-2021	Helm, Paul/0000-0002-7462-4217; 														2690-0637				MAR 18	2024	4	4					1422	1432		10.1021/acsestwater.3c00589	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsestwater.3c00589		MAR 2024											WOS:001187225400001

Fire in Feces: Bats Reliably Record Fire History in Their Guano	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												New approaches are needed to resolve persistent geographic gaps and biases in paleofire research. Most sedimentary paleofire research relies on lake and peat sediments. We present an unconventional sedimentary charcoal record preserved in a modern, post-bomb bat guano deposit and compare its accumulation to historical fire data. We find strong correlations between charcoal accumulation rates (CHAR) and non-winter prescribed burns. CHAR in bat guano is more strongly correlated with prescribed fire than wildfire or total area burned, likely due to bats seeking out areas burned by prescribed fire for better foraging opportunities and/or bats avoiding wildfire. We attribute the CHAR in guano being a better recorder of area burned during non-winter months to winter bat hibernation. Our analyses show that charcoal preserved in bat guano is a reliable paleofire proxy system, which has important implications for the paleofire field and encourages future research using bat guano as a viable archive. Charcoal preserved in sediments can be used to reconstruct fire history. The bulk of these studies focus on traditional sediments (e.g., lakes, peats). We try this out with bat guano, a very unconventional sediment system. By comparing charcoal preserved in guano with historical fire maps, we show that guano charcoal reliably reconstructs fire history. But, it is even better at reconstructing non-winter fire (due to bat hibernation during the winter) and prescribed fire (due to bats avoiding wildfire and seeking out prescribed fire areas). Our work is an important first step to show that charcoal in bat guano is a reliable method. It also opens new doors for understanding fire history more broadly, due to the seasonal and behavioral uniqueness of bats. Fire history is recorded by charcoal in bat guano Bat guano can differentiate human-set fires from wildfires Bat behavior governs seasonal lens of guano as fire recorder					; Tsalickis, Alexandra/HHM-5472-2022	Tsalickis, Alexandra/0000-0002-5643-5551; Vachula, Richard/0000-0001-5559-6540													0094-8276	1944-8007				OCT 16	2024	51	19							e2024GL112045	10.1029/2024GL112045	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024GL112045													WOS:001325870200001

Assessing the effects of severe rainstorm-induced mixing on a subtropical, subalpine lake	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Severe rainstorms cause vertical mixing that modifies the internal dynamics (e. g., internal seiche, thermal structure, and velocity filed) in warm polymictic lakes. Yuan Yang Lake (YYL), a subtropical, subalpine, and seasonally stratified small lake in the north-central region of Taiwan, is normally affected by typhoons accompanied with strong wind and heavy rainfall during the summer and fall. In this study, we used the field data, statistical analysis, spectral analysis, and numerical modeling to investigate severe rainstorm-induced mixing in the lake. Statistical determination of the key meteorological and environmental conditions underlying the observed vertical mixing suggests that the vertical mixing, caused by heat loss during severe rainstorms, was likely larger than wind-induced mixing and that high inflow discharge strongly increased heat loss through advection heat. Spectral analysis revealed that internal seiches at the basin scale occurred under non-rainstorm meteorological conditions and that the internal seiches under the rainstorm were modified on the increase of the internal seiche frequencies. Based upon observed frequencies of the internal seiches, a two-dimensional model was simulated and then appropriate velocity patterns of the internal seiches were determined under non-rainstorm conditions. Moreover, the model implemented with inflow boundary condition was conducted for rainstorm events. The model results showed that the severe rainstorms promoted thermal destratification and changed vertical circulation of the basin-scale, internal seiche motion into riverine flow.					; Kimura, Nobuaki/AAP-4316-2020; Liu, Wen-Cheng/ABG-4271-2020	KIMURA, NOBUAKI/0000-0001-7399-987X; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2014	186	5					3091	3114		10.1007/s10661-013-3603-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-013-3603-7								24415132					WOS:000333801200035
J	Koszelnik, P				Koszelnik, Piotr			The Role of Silicon in the Process of Eutrophication of the Waters - Solina and Myczkowce Reservoirs Case Study	ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA												This paper reports on studies conducted during 2005-2006 years in the ecosystem of the Solina-Myczkowce mountain complex of mesotrophic reservoirs on the San River, SE Poland. The goal of the present study has been to analyse the functioning of the reservoirs as a dissolved silicon sink especially whether silicon assumes a limiting role where the biological productivity of reservoirs waters is concerned. Silicon is one of the biosphere's most abundant elements, and one that - in the form of dissolved silica - serves as a very important nutrient playing a major role in the functioning of marine, coastal and inland waters. Investigations indicate that reservoirs are major sinks for the dissolved silica in a river system and that unfavorable changes in water chemistry downstream may ensue where (as is usually the case), the water discharged from a reservoir is poorer in Si than that supplied to it. The noted Si depletion in both the analysed reservoirs influenced growth of non-siliceous algae expressed in terms of chl a. Siliceous algal growth is usually observed there during spring. I suppose that the first chl a maximum in the case of the Solina Reservoir, and the only maximum in the Myczkowce Reservoir, result from the growth of both siliceous and green algae. The next increase in chl a observed only in the Solina Reservoir may result from the presence of the cyanobacteria often observed in warm lakes at the end of summer. Their absence from Myczkowce reflects the low temperature of that reservoir's water, this being supplied from the hypolimnion of the upper one. These observations are confirmed in relationships between mean measured concentrations of Si and mean concentrations of chl a in the euphotic zone of the two reservoirs. Observed summer depletion of the silicate accelerates the growth of phytoplankton exponentially, especially in the case of the upper reservoir.

In-pond methylation efficiencies (percent of THg as TMeHg) peaked when ponds were ice-covered (%TMeHg/ THg range: 53-80%) and in summer (% TMeHg/THg range: 34-67%). Low oxygen concentrations during these periods likely promoted reducing conditions leading to inorganic mercury methylation. Total dissolved MeHg was the predominant fraction of TMeHg in outlets (80% on average), and TMeHg values were up to 27-fold higher in outlets compared to inlets in summer. During the summer, TMeHg concentrations (up to 2.80 ng L-1) were higher in the recent pond than in the older ones. Seasons and pond age influence MeHg production dynamic in beaver ponds; beaver pond formation may increase MeHg transfer through food webs within the pond area and in downstream aquatic systems.

The model results were compared to long-term observations of currents and temperature at seven moorings and two NOAA buoys. The accuracy of modeled currents improved considerably relative to previous summer circulation modeling done on a 5 km grid, while the accuracy of temperature simulations remained the same. Particle trajectory model results were also compared with satellite-tracked surface drifter observations. Large-scale circulation patterns tend to be more cyclonic (counterclockwise) toward the end of summer as the thermocline deepens and density effects become more important. Circulation in southern Lake Michigan appears to be more variable than circulation in northern Lake Michigan. An important new feature not previously seen in observations was found in southern Lake Michigan: an anticyclonic gyre extending northward from the southern shore of Lake Michigan, sometimes occupying the entire southern basin.					; Schwab, David/B-7498-2012	Beletsky, Dmitry/0000-0003-4532-0588; 													2169-9275	2169-9291				OCT 20	2006	111	C10							C10010	10.1029/2005JC003222	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2005JC003222													WOS:000241696000002
J	Jackson, LJ; Lauridsen, TL; Sondergaard, M; Jeppesen, E				Jackson, Leland J.; Lauridsen, Torben L.; Sondergaard, M.; Jeppesen, Erik			A comparison of shallow Danish and Canadian lakes and implications of climate change	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Winter temperatures differ markedly on the Canadian prairies compared with Denmark. Between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2002, average weekly and monthly temperatures did not drop below 0 degrees C in the vicinity of Silkeborg, Denmark. Over this same time, weekly average temperatures near Calgary, Alberta, Canada, often dropped below -10 degrees C for 3-5 weeks and the average monthly temperature was below 0 degrees C for 2-4 months. Accordingly, winter ice conditions in shallow lakes in Canada and Denmark differed considerably. 2. To assess the implications of winter climate for lake biotic structure and function we compared a number of variables that describe the chemistry and biology of shallow Canadian and Danish lakes that had been chosen to have similar morphometries. 3. The Danish lakes had a fourfold higher ratio of chlorophyll-a: total phosphorus (TP). Zooplankton : phytoplankton carbon was related to TP and fish abundance in Danish lakes but not in Canadian lakes. There was no significant difference in the ratio log total zooplankton biomass : log TP and the Canadian lakes had a significantly higher proportion of cladocerans that were Daphnia. These differences correspond well with the fact that the Danish lakes have more abundant and diverse fish communities than the Canadian lakes. 4. Our results suggest that severe Canadian winters lead to anoxia under ice and more depauperate fish communities, and stronger zooplankton control on phytoplankton in shallow prairie lakes compared with shallow Danish lakes. If climate change leads to warmer winters and a shorter duration of ice cover, we predict that shallow Canadian prairie lakes will experience increased survivorship of planktivores and stronger control of zooplankton. This, in turn, might decrease zooplankton control on phytoplankton, leading to 'greener' lakes on the Canadian prairies.

Here we show that the sea surface temperature (SST) in the north tropical Atlantic Ocean (NTAO) exerts a phase-locked effect on the anomalous seesaw pattern in the 0 degrees C isotherm elevation with a node around 84.5 degrees E, after the upward trend in the 0 degrees C isotherm elevation is removed. When the NTAO SST anomalies are warmer than normal, wave-train-like patterns are forced out over western Africa-southeastern Tibetan Plateau with the same anomalous centers from the lower to upper troposphere. An anomalous temperature dipole associated with this wave-train-like pattern is the direct cause of the rise (fall) in the 0 degrees C isotherm elevation along the southern slopes of the western (eastern) Himalayas in pre-monsoon season. When the NTAO SST anomalies are colder than normal, the opposite situation develops. This significant phase-locked correlation between NTAO SST and trend-removed isotherm elevation, which persists from the previous autumn to the current pre-monsoon season, will help to both elucidate and mitigate the risks posed by glacier-related hazards such as glacial lake outburst floods and avalanches over the southern Himalayas.																			0169-8095	1873-2895				AUG 15	2025	322								108122	10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108122	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108122		APR 2025											WOS:001468707200001

We use a unique set of over half a century of lake data from two lakes in Switzerland to determine the effect of the 2003 heat wave on water temperature and oxygen conditions in order to assess how temperate lakes will react when exposed to the increased ambient summer air temperatures that will be encountered in a generally warmer world and to test the predictions of relevant simulation models. In both lakes, surface temperature and thermal stability in summer 2003 were the highest ever recorded, exceeding the long-term mean by more than 2.5 standard deviations. The extremely high degree of thermal stability resulted in extraordinarily strong hypolimnetic oxygen depletion. These results are consistent with the predictions of the simulation models. Additionally, the results indicate that climatic warming will increase the risk of occurrence of deep-water anoxia, thus counteracting long-term efforts that have been undertaken to ameliorate the effects of anthropogenic eutrophication.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2006	51	2					815	819		10.4319/lo.2006.51.2.0815	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2006.51.2.0815													WOS:000236343600002

Recent dam construction on the Yangtze River and its tributaries for agriculture and hydroelectric power has affected the hydrological regimes in downstream lakes. The Three Gorges Dam changed the hydrological regime of downstream lakes by reducing wet season flooding and expanding water storage in the dry season. Despite the critical role of Poyang Lake in regional and global biodiversity conservation and the potential adverse ecological impacts of the Three Gorges Dam on downstream lakes, there have been few studies of the hydrological requirements of wintering waterbirds in the middle Yangtze floodplains. We assembled a predictor matrix including three hydrological variables (annual inflow, maximum water level in high water season or MaxWL and minimum water level in low water season or MinWL) and two climatic variables (annual rainfall and biological cumulative temperature or BioT). Using the predictor matrix and annual waterbird census, we built group-specific generalised additive models (GAM) to investigate how waterbird population variations were related to climatic and hydrological factors in the Poyang Lake National Natural Reserve. We then used the modelled predictor-response curves to identify the optimal lake water levels for each waterbird group. The community-level model selected group and the group-varying-coefficient term of BioT, Inflow and MaxWL as explanatory variables. At group level, tuber eaters and sedge foragers responded positively to BioT and MinWL. Seed eaters, invertebrate eaters and fish eaters responded positively to Inflow and negatively to MaxWL and MinWL. Based on the modelled predictor-response curves, we propose the following optimal water level ranges for Poyang Lake wintering waterbird conservation: a) maximum high water season level should be less than 17.4m; and b) minimum low water level should be between 8.2m and 8.8m.

J	Ahlberg, K; Almgren, E; Wright, HE; Ito, E				Ahlberg, K; Almgren, E; Wright, HE; Ito, E			Holocene stable-isotope stratigraphy at Lough Gur, County Limerick, Western Ireland	HOLOCENE												After the pronounced fluctuation of 4 parts per thousand in delta O-18 during the Younger Dryas and the 1 parts per thousand dip during the Preboreal Oscillation, values for delta O-18 decreased very steadily from -2.5 to -5.3 parts per thousand from 9300 to about 8000 C-14 yr BP (uncal.). This early-Holocene decrease of almost 3 parts per thousand is interpreted as a result of a decline of almost 6 degreesC in the temperature of precipitation. The previous high temperature of much of the Lateglacial and the Preboreal (12000-9300 yr BP uncal.) may reflect warm summers related to greater insolation and warm winters caused by the influence of the Laurentide ice sheet on atmospheric circulation. After 8000 yr BP a disconformity interrupts the sequence, but after about 5000 yr BP the delta O-18 and delta C-13 are irregular because of a low lake level, as shown by the occurrence of littoral shells and woody detritus in the littoral core, and because of anthropogenic factors, as inferred from pollen indicators of forest disturbance and farming found in both the littoral and offshore cores.

Examining inter-regional and intra-seasonal differences in wintering waterfowl landscape associations among Pacific and Atlantic flyways	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY												The Central Valley of California (CVC) and Mid-Atlantic (MA) in the U.S. are both critical sites for nationwide food security, and many waterfowl species annually, especially during the winter, providing feeding and roosting locations for a variety of species. Mapping waterfowl distributions, using NEXRAD, may aid in the adaptive management of important waterfowl habitat and allow various government agencies to better understand the interface between wild and domestic birds and commercial agricultural practices. We used 9 years (2014-2023) of data from the US NEXRAD network to model winter waterfowl relative abundance in the CVC and MA as a function of weather, temporal period, environmental conditions, and landcover characteristics using boosted regression tree modelling. We were able to quantify the variability in effect size of 28 different covariates across space and time within two geographic regions which are critical to nationwide waterfowl management and host a high density of nationally important commercial agriculture. In general, weather, geographic (distance to features), and landcover condition (wetness index) predictors had the strongest relative effect on predicting wintering waterfowl relative abundance in both regions, while effects of land cover composition were more regionally and temporally specific. Increased daily mean temperature was a major predictor of increasing relative waterfowl abundance in both regions throughout the winter. Increasing precipitation had differing effects within regions, increasing relative waterfowl abundance in the MA, while decreasing in general within the CVC. Increasing relative waterfowl abundance in the CVC are strongly tied to the flooding of the landscape and rice availability, whereas waterfowl in the MA, where water is less limiting, are generally governed by waste grain availability and emergent wetland on the landscape. Waterfowl relative abundance in the MA was generally higher nearer to the Atlantic coast and lakes, while in the CVC they were higher nearer to lakes. Our findings promote a better understanding of spatial associations of waterfowl to landscape features and may aid in conservation and biosecurity management protocols.

Effectiveness of Bare-root and Gravel-culture Shrubs Used in Wildlife Habitat Restoration on Lakeshores in Northern Wisconsin	ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION												Human development on lakeshore habitats has greatly reduced shrub layer coverage along many North American lakes, negatively impacting associated floral and faunal communities. In northern Wisconsin, several restoration projects have been implemented in recent decades to reverse the impacts of development on lakeshore natural communities. However, restoration practitioners are frequently limited to using containerized plant stock purchased at local nurseries, which can be cost-prohibitive. As an alternative, we tested the effectiveness of using dormant bare-root shrubs in restoration projects along five lakeshores in northern Wisconsin. Because bare-root plant stock can only be planted during narrow windows during the late fall and early spring, we examined the efficacy of using bare-root stock that was grown in a gravel medium ("gravel-culture") and then planted later during the growing season. We monitored individuals from five species of native shrubs in each of three planting treatments over a three-year period and used a repeated measures, mixed-model approach to compare plant growth of both bare-root and gravel culture stock to growth of containerized stock. Logistic regression models were used to compare the survival of shrubs and treatments. Containerized stock exhibited the greatest growth and survival of the stock types examined. The utility of bare-root and gravel-culture stock varied among species, but for most species our results suggest that gravel-culture may be successfully used to extend the planting window.																			1543-4060	1543-4079				JUN	2018	36	2					134	144		10.3368/er.36.2.134	http://dx.doi.org/10.3368/er.36.2.134													WOS:000456504300008

Samplings were performed from spring to autumn in 2014 and 2015 in different wetland localities represented by lagoons, lakes and a river. A total of 30 Odonata species were recorded during the study, of which Libellula quadrimaculata is a new record for both the study area and Turkish Thrace. In addition, Calopteryx splendens (Harris, 1780), Lestes dryas Kirby, 1890, Lestes macrostigma (Eversmann, 1836), Coenagrion puella (Linnaeus, 1758), Coenagrion pulchellum (Vander Linden, 1825), Coenagrion scitulum (Rambur, 1842), Enallagma cyathigerum (Charpentier, 1840), lschnura pumilio (Charpentier, 1825), Aeshna affinis Vander Linden, 1820, Aeshna isoceles (Muller, 1767), Anax imperator Leach, 1815, Lindenia tetraphylla (Vander Linden, 1825), Libellula depressa Linnaeus, 1758, Libellula fulva Muller, 1764, Orthetrum brunneum (Fonscolombe, 1837) and Sympetrum meridionale (Selys, 1841) are the species determined to be new records for the Meric Delta wetland. While the Odonata fauna of the Meric Delta was represented so far by 14 species, this number increased to 31 with the addition of 17 new species during this study. The diversity of the Odonata species recorded in the delta and their conservation categories according to the Red List criteria of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) are also considered.																			1302-0250						2018	20		3				105	117																WOS:000453342500009

Timing of wet episodes in Atacama Desert over the last 15 ka. The Groundwater Discharge Deposits (GWD) from Domeyko Range at 25°S	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A chronologically robust reconstruction of timing and dynamics of millennial time scale wet episodes encompassing the entire Atacama Desert during the last 15 ka has been constructed. To accomplish this, a new composite paleoclimatic record from Groundwater Discharge Deposits (GWD) in the Sierra de Varas (Domeyko Range, southern Atacama in Chile at 25 degrees S) has been compiled and compared with other published paleohydrologic records from the Atacama region. In Sierra de Varas (SV), three millennial timescale wet climate phases have been characterized: around 14.5 ka cal BP, 12.2-9.8 ka cal BP, and 4.7 ka cal BP to the present day. These wet phases are interpreted from intervals of GWD fades formed during periods when the springs were active. GWD facies include: (1) black organic peat, rooted mud stones and sandstones formed in local wetland environments, and (2) gypsum-carbonate rich layers formed by interstitial growth. GWD intervals alternate with gravelly alluvial material deposited during arid phases. A trend towards less humid conditions during the Late Holocene wet episode characterizes GWD sedimentary series in Sierra the Varas, suggesting the onset of a dry episode over the last few centuries. Around 0.7 ka BP a very short wet episode is recorded in the central part of the desert suggesting this was the time of maximum humidity for the entire late Holocene wet period. A brief arid phase occurred between 1.5 and 2.01 a BP indicated by the absence of GWD in the Domeyko Range. The paleoclimatic reconstruction encompassing the entire Atacama region shows that both the intensity and occurrence of wetter conditions were governed mainly by the distance to the source of moisture, and secondarily by the elevation of the sites. In the northern Atacama (16-20 degrees S), four wet phases fed by N-NE summer monsoon precipitations have been proposed: Tauca phase (18-14 ka cal BP) and Coipasa phase (13-10 ka cal BP) during the Late Glacial, followed by Early Holocene and Late Holocene phases. In contrast, southern Atacama records (23-28 degrees S) display only three pluvial periods which result from SE summer monsoon precipitation and outbreaks from the Westerlies during wintertime. The Early Holocene in the southern Atacama was a period of aridity, generating important landscape differences to those in the Northern Atacama where conditions were wetter. The core of Atacama (20-23 degrees S) is the overall driest part of the desert because it is located in the distal limits of both N-NE and SE sources of moisture, the Amazon Basin and Gran Chaco areas, respectively.

The ratio showed a trimodal distribution for the case of thermal/mineral water: 0.7052-0.7053 (Type A, Zao hot spring), 0.7039-0.7043 (Type B, Okama crater lake and Shin-funkiko hot spring), and 0.7070-0.7073 (Type C, Gaga, Aone, and Togatta hot springs), respectively. However, in comparison, the ratio was found to be higher for meteoric waters (0.7077-0.7079). The water from the central volcanic edifice (Type B) was found to be similar to that of nearby volcanic rocks in their Sr isotopic ratio. This indicates that the Sr in water was derived from shallow volcanic rocks. The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio for water from the Zao hot spring (Type A) was intermediate between those of the pre-Tertiary granitic and the Quaternary volcanic rocks, thus suggesting that the water had reacted with both volcanic and granitic rocks. The location of the vapor-liquid separation was determined as the boundary of the pre-Tertiary granitic and the Quaternary volcanic rocks by comparing the results of this strontium isotopic study with those of Kiyosu and Kurahashi [Kiyosu, Y., Kurahashi, M., 1984.

J	Gray, CA				Gray, Charles A.			First record of biological traits of the Australian endemic longfin pike (Dinolestes lewini : Dinolestidae)	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Dinolestes lewini (longfin pike) is a common, but little studied, fish species endemic to temperate marine-dominated waters below similar to 31 degrees S on the east, south and west coasts of the Australian mainland and around Tasmania. Samples of longfin pike collected in Lake Macquarie, a large coastal lagoon in south-eastern Australia, were examined for age, growth and reproductive characteristics. Spawning occurred over an extended period between at least October and March (austral spring to autumn), and although spent individuals occurred in samples, spawning location could not be ascertained. Examination of otolith edge condition provided strong support that opaque and translucent zones were deposited annually and that counts of opaque zones on otoliths can be used to estimate ages. Sex-related differences in mean length at age and projected growth based on the von Bertalanffy growth function were evident. Growth trajectories diverged at similar to 1.5 years of age, after which females grew faster than males for a longer period, eventually attaining greater observed maximum lengths and ages. Observed longevity was 5(+) and 9(+) years for males and females, respectively. The data provide an initial knowledge-platform for incorporation in species assessments and for further comparative investigations of variation in biological traits across the species' distribution.

J	Jones, B; Peng, XT				Jones, Brian; Peng, Xiaotong			Signatures of biologically influenced CaCo3 and Mg-Fe silicate precipitation in hot springs: Case study from the Ruidian geothermal area, western Yunnan Province, China	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Hot springs at Gongxiaoshe and Zhuyuan (maximum temperatures of 73 to 84 degrees C, respectively) are characterized by deposits formed of calcite, aragonite, non-crystalline Si-Mg-Fe deposits, and minor amounts of barite and gypsum. The deposits at Gongxiaoshe are formed largely of alternating calcite and aragonite laminae, whereas those at Zhuyuan are formed largely of calcite. The calcite is in the form of: (i) pseudodendrites that grew as sub-crystals stacked upon each other; and (ii) unattached euhedral and incompletely formed dodecahedral and rhombohedral crystals. Amorphous CaCO3, formed of nanoparticles <1m long, is common in some of the Zhuyuan deposits, but minor in the Gongxiaoshe deposits. The morphologically diverse arrays of aragonite crystals that lie parallel to bedding were not nucleated on a growth surface. Many substrates in these deposits are covered with reticulate coatings that are formed largely of Si and Mg with minor Fe and micro-granular coatings that are formed largely of Si and Fe. Biofilms, with their extracellular polymeric substances, and microbes are common at both springs. The compositionally and crystallographically diverse precipitates at these two springs are attributed to a biologically influenced model with precipitation taking place in micro-domains that developed in the extracellular polymeric substances. According to this model, precipitation varied at the micron-scale influenced by the elemental concentrations that developed in the hydrogel of extracellular polymeric substances. Critically, the very low preservation potential of the extracellular polymeric substance and its formative microbes means that the precipitates will rapidly lose evidence of their biotic origin. The compositional diversity of the precipitates, the crystallographic diversity of the calcite and aragonite with numerous incompletely formed crystals, and local concentrations of Si, Mg and Fe may, however, serve as proxies of that biologically influenced precipitation.					; Peng, Xiaotong/G-3108-2013	Jones, Brian/0000-0003-3088-5543; 													0037-0746	1365-3091				JAN	2014	61	1					56	89		10.1111/sed.12043	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sed.12043													WOS:000328957800004

Phytoplankton Seasonality Along a Trophic Gradient of Temperate Lakes: Convergence in Taxonomic Compostion during Winter Ice-Cover	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												A gap in our understanding of phytoplankton seasonality in temperate lakes exists mainly due to the lack of information collected during the winter months. We summarized seasonal changes of phytoplankton biomass and taxonomic composition relative to water-column biogeochemical conditions in 6 lakes located on Beaver Island and 1 site in Lake Michigan in close geographic proximity to each other (<20 km apart). A number of physical-chemical parameters (e.g., temperature, DOC) were similar between lakes, but lakes towards the interior of the island had lower pH, alkalinity, and conductivity. Moreover, lakes at the interior of the island supported 2-fold greater phytoplankton-chlorophyll and carbon compared with perimeter lakes, and phytoplankton taxonomic composition differed considerably during the ice-free period (April-December). Interestingly, the winter phytoplankton assemblages were strikingly similar in all 7 lakes, when large populations of phyto-flagellates (Chrysophyceae and Cryptophyceae) occurred under the ice at low light and temperatures < 4 degrees C. Given the mixotrophic capabilities of these phytoflagellates, we suggest seasonal convergence reflects the community response to under-ice conditions, which promotes the occurrence of an important component of annual phytoplankton biomass.

Identification of microsatellite loci and examination of genetic structure for the endangered springsnails Juturnia kosteri and Pyrgulopsis roswellensis in the Chihuahuan Desert	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. Desert spring ecosystems harbour many endemic species that are threatened with extinction owing to human activities. Springsnails (superfamily Truncatelloidea) are among the most diverse freshwater snail groups in desert springs of western North America. They occupy geographically narrow ranges, often consisting of a single spring or spring complex. 2. Microsatellite markers were developed via high-throughput de novo sequencing for two endangered springsnail species, Juturnia kosteri and Pyrgulopsis roswellensis, endemic to springs on Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge (BLNWR) near Roswell, New Mexico, USA. Genetic diversity, population structure, effective population size (N-e), and historic demography were assessed in two populations for each species. 3. A large number of putative markers were identified, of which 14 loci for J. kosteri and 18 loci for P. roswellensis showed polymorphism. Genetic diversity and N-e were greater in P. roswellensis than J. kosteri. Significant genetic differentiation (F-ST = 0.187-0.288) was found among populations for both species, indicating currently limited gene flow. Neither species showed signs of recent population bottlenecks. 4. Analyses with microsatellite markers revealed fine-scale population genetic structure in both species, unlike a previous study using mitochondrial DNA sequences. Although these species co-occur on BLNWR, slightly different genetic characteristics between them suggest that they may have different evolutionary and demographic histories. Small N-e relative to census size indicates strong genetic drift in these populations. Future efforts should be directed to identifying causes of such strong drift. 5. Because there are limited numbers of microsatellite markers available for springsnails, the markers identified in this study should be useful for congeners via cross-species amplification. Understanding current genetic variation and structure of these species is not only required for species recovery, but will also be useful for comparisons among many aquatic organisms endemic to springs of western North America.

To achieve this a combined study was undertaken of pore water geochemistry and petrology of the top 25 cm canal bed sediment from two urban canals in the English West Midland conurbation. Processes in the sediment are dominated by the geochemistry of Fe, P and organic matter. Results indicate that sediment re-suspension by boat traffic has a major influence on pore water chemistry. In addition to the sediment water interface an additional interface at 6-7 cm depth was identified and corresponds to the maximum depth of sediment resuspension by boat traffic. Phosphorus in the sediment occurs predominantly as vivianite. Low PO4 concentrations occur close to the sediment water interface in summer due to frequent re-suspension and Fe oxidation. High PO4 concentrations occur close to the sediment water interface in winter when boat traffic is infrequent. The greatest potential to exchange phosphate between sediment and water column will therefore occur during infrequent boat traffic regimes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Janiga, M; Janiga, M; Haas, M				Janiga, Martin; Janiga, Marian; Haas, Martina			Ecotoxicology of alpine streams in the West Carpathians-Alpine Bullhead (Cottus poecilopus) and high mountain flash flood effects	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Flash floods represent a serious threat to wildlife, water biota, and human life in pre-alpine regions, particularly in recent historical memory. The alpine bullhead is an established bioindicator of water quality in mountain streams, which can be adversely affected by an increased propensity for flash flooding. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of flash flooding on the variation of chemical elements found in the skull of alpine bullheads, with a focus on inter-annual effects. Their bone tissue reflects an increased concentration of K and Cl and a decreased concentration of biogenic Cr, Zn, and Mo, absorbed mainly through the gills, for up to 2 years following a flood. During autumn, following a summer flash flood, the amount of Mn and Fe present in skull tissues of fish was found to have increased, tapering off again over the following year. These metals are predominantly ingested by bullheads while feeding. The lack of specific types of biogenic concentration in the water may be critical to the definition of presence/absence patterns, as populations were shown to decline 2 to 3 years post-flood. Pre-alpine streams are particularly susceptible to this type of flooding. The decreases in biogenic elements and increase of K and Cl exhibited in bullhead tissues indicate that a negative ecological footprint due to flash floods can still be observed several years following the event.					; Janiga, Marián/ABB-9862-2021; HAAS, MARTINA/AAL-6941-2021	HAAS, MARTINA/0000-0003-1706-2980; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				OCT	2021	28	37					51297	51305		10.1007/s11356-021-14157-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14157-1		MAY 2021						33982255					WOS:000650138500010

Thawing and subsequent mineralization of permafrost increases plant-available N around the thaw-front. Because plant production in these peatlands is N-limited, such changes may substantially affect net primary production and species composition. We aimed to identify the potential impact of increased N-availability due to permafrost thawing on subarctic peatland plant production and species performance, relative to the impact of increased N-availability in superficial organic layers. Therefore, we investigated whether plant roots are present at the thaw-front (45 cm depth) and whether N-uptake (N-15-tracer) at the thaw-front occurs during maximum thaw-depth, coinciding with the end of the growing season. Moreover, we performed a unique 3-year belowground fertilization experiment with fully factorial combinations of deep-(thaw-front) and shallow-fertilization (10 cm depth) and controls. We found that certain species are present with roots at the thaw-front (Rubus chamaemorus) and have the capacity (R. chamaemorus, Eriophorum vaginatum) for N-uptake from the thaw-front between autumn and spring when aboveground tissue is largely senescent. In response to 3-year shallow-belowground fertilization (S) both shallow-(Empetrum hermaphroditum) and deep-rooting species increased aboveground biomass and N-content, but only deep-rooting species responded positively to enhanced nutrient supply at the thaw-front (D). Moreover, the effects of shallow-fertilization and thaw-front fertilization on aboveground biomass production of the deep-rooting species were similar in magnitude (S: 71%; D: 111% increase compared to control) and additive (S + D: 181% increase). Our results show that plant-available N released from thawing permafrost can form a thus far overlooked additional N-source for deep-rooting subarctic plant species and increase their biomass production beyond the already established impact of warming-driven enhanced shallow N-mineralization. This may result in shifts in plant community composition and may partially counteract the increased carbon losses from thawing permafrost.

Two gradients proved to be responsible for the macrophyte structure: 1) the depth and light gradient, and 2) the seasonality of water trophy. The depth of occurrence, light conditions and interspecies competition are the key factors determining the production of L. barbatus biomass and oospores. In 2018 mass overwintering of total macrophytes and L. barbatus in mild winter conditions significantly improved lake water quality, indicating that macrophyte communities can protect lakes from the negative consequences of global warming. This research thus demonstrated that macrophytes are a key factor in improving and stabilising water quality of a temperate mesotrophic lake which hosts one of the largest populations of the endangered charophyte.

The DOC, and HMW-DOC concentrations, as well as environmental factors, including water temperature, nitrate, phosphate, and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), were analyzed. A significant negative relationship was observed between Chl-a and nitrate concentration, suggesting that cyanobacterial bloom was limited by nitrate. The high phosphate concentration can probably be attributed to phosphorus released from the sediment or can be a result of the accumulation of bloom. Furthermore, DOC concentration significantly increased with water temperature, and was negatively related to nitrate concentration, indicating that these two environmental factors are well correlated to DOC dynamics. DOC concentration did not significantly corresponded with the Chl-a concentration in Lake Taihu. Moreover, the relationship between HMW-DOC and Chl-a concentration was only observed in Gonghu Bay, suggesting that DOC and HMW-DOC are not solely derived from cyanobacterial bloom. Other organic carbon origins, such as terrestrial input, were also assumed to play an important role in Lake Taihu.

Coupled stalagmite - Alluvial fan response to the 8.2 ka event and early Holocene palaeoclimate change in Greece	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												We explore the expression of early Holocene climatic change in the terrestrial Mediterranean of southern Greece. A regional palaeoclimate record from stable isotope and trace element geochemical proxies in an early Holocene (similar to 12.4 ka to 6.7 ka) stalagmite is compared to the timing of palaeosol (entisol) development on an early Holocene alluvial fan located < 100 km from the stalagmite site. Radiocarbon dated entisol development records fan abandonment surfaces, which can be coupled to the stalagmite climate signal. Variations in delta C-13 best record the main elements of palaeoclimatic change, more negative values indicating soil carbon input to karst groundwater under wetter conditions. The wettest conditions begin around 10.3 ka, coincident with the start of sapropel 1 deposition in the eastern Mediterranean. The widely documented northern hemisphere '8.2 ka event' of cooler and drier conditions has a muted delta O-18 climatic signal in common with other stalagmite climate records from the wider Mediterranean. However, less negative delta C-13 values do record a period of episodic dryness between similar to 8.8 and ending at 8.2 ka. Wetter conditions re-established after 8.1 ka to the end of the record. The oldest alluvial fan entisols were developing by similar to 9.5 ka, and a prominent rubified entisol developed similar to 8.3 to 8.4 ka, indicating pedogenesis within dating error of the 8.2 ka event. The speleothem record of episodic dryness between similar to 8.8 and 8.2 ka, combined with other regional proxies, is consistent with the notion that precipitation patterns in Greece may have changed from predominantly winter frontal to summer convective during this period. Palaeosol formation on the alluvial fan may have been an allocyclic response to this change. It is plausible that fan-channel incision, driven by temporary development of a 'flashier' summer rainfall regime, isolated large areas of the fan surface allowing onset of prolonged pedogenesis there.

Polyethylene passive samplers (PEs) were thus simultaneously deployed at 19 sites in surface water and near surface atmosphere across Lake Superior to determine air and water concentrations and air-water gradients of 18 PCBs and 24 OCPs. PCBs in the air and water were characterized by penta- and hexachlorobiphenyls with distribution along the coast correlated with proximity to developed areas. Surface water and atmospheric concentrations were dominated by alpha-HCH (average 250 pg L-1 and 4.2 pg m(-3), respectively), followed by HCB (average 17 pg L-1 and 89 pg m(-3), respectively). Decreases in open lake concentrations of PCBs in water and air from spring to summer were consistent with ongoing volatilization from the surface layer as the main cause. Conversely, alpha-endosulfan was consistently deposited into the surface water of Lake Superior. Results indicated that PCBs were depleted in the surface mixed layer, implying a physical limit on evasive fluxes. This was corroborated with measurements from a vertical profile, displaying greater PCB concentrations at depth.					; Helm, Paul/ABC-1534-2021; Lohmann, Rainer/B-1511-2008; Muir, Derek/F-6183-2011	Lohmann, Rainer/0000-0001-8796-3229; Helm, Paul/0000-0002-7462-4217; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				DEC 18	2018	52	24					14061	14069		10.1021/acs.est.8b04036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b04036								30433769					WOS:000454183400005

Fish from the populations used in this study spawn annually in early-to mid-April. Walleye showed group synchronous ovarian development with exogenous vitellogenesis beginning in autumn. Oocyte diameters increased rapidly from similar to 200 mu m in October to similar to 1,000 mu m in November, and reached a maximum of 1,500 mu m just prior to spawning. Changes in gonadosomatic indices (GSIs) paralleled changes in oocyte diameters. Serum E(2) levels in females increased rapidly from low values in October (< 0.1 ng ml(-1)) to peak levels of 3.7 ng ml(-1) in November, coinciding with the period of the most rapid ovarian growth. Subsequently, E(2) levels decreased from December through spawning. Serum T levels exhibited a bimodal pattern, increasing to 1.6 ng ml(-1) in November, and peaking again at 3.3 ng ml(-1) just prior to spawning. We detected 11-KT in the serum of some females at concentrations up to 5.6 ng ml(-1) but no seasonal pattern was apparent. In this study (unlike our results in a related study) 17,20-P was not detected. In males, differentiation of spermatogonia began in late August, and by January the testes were filled (> 95% of germ cells) with spermatozoa. Mature spermatozoa could be expressed from males from January through April. GSIs ranged from 0.2% (post-spawn) to 3.2% (pre-spawn). Serum T levels rose from undetectable levels in post-spawn males to 1.6 ng ml(-1) by November, remained elevated throughout the winter, and peaked at 2.8 ng ml(-1) prior to spawning. Levels of 11-KT in males remained low(< 10 ng ml(-1)) from post-spawning through January, then increased significantly by March and peaked just prior to spawning at 39.7 ng ml(-1). Our results indicate that vitellogenesis and spermatogenesis are complete or nearly so, in walleye by early winter, and suggest that it may be possible to induce spawning in this species several months prior to the normal spawning season by subjecting fish to relatively simple environmental and hormonal treatments.																			0920-1742					DEC	1994	13	6					473	484		10.1007/BF00004330	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00004330								24197143					WOS:A1994PY98800005
J	BARKER, HW; LI, ZQ; BLANCHET, JP				BARKER, HW; LI, ZQ; BLANCHET, JP			RADIATIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CANADIAN-CLIMATE-CENTER 2ND-GENERATION GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Several observational datasets were used to assess the quality of the radiative characteristics of the Canadian Climate Centre (CCC) second-generation GCM. The GCM data were obtained from the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) simulation. Data corresponding to the period January 1985 through December 1988 were examined since this period of the AMIP simulation overlaps with the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) and the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) datasets. Attention was given to mean January and July conditions. Optical properties of surfaces, clear skies, and cloudy skies were examined. Ocean albedos are too high in the Tropics and too low in the polar regions relative to surface observations and theoretical estimates. Compared to a satellite-derived dataset, however, they are slightly underestimated. Throughout much of the Sahara and Saudi Deserts surface albedos are too low, while for much of Western Australia they are too high. Excessive amounts of snow in Southeast Asia seem to have been sustained by a localized snow albedo feedback related to inappropriate snow albedo specification and a weak masking effect by vegetation. Neglect of freshwater lakes in the Canadian Shield leads to negative and positive albedo anomalies in winter and summer, respectively. Like many GCMs, the CCC model has too little atmospheric H2O vapor. This results in too much outgoing longwave radiation from clear skies, especially in the Tropics. Neglect of all trace gases except for CO2 and weak H2O vapor absorption exacerbate this bias. Assessment of the radiative properties of clouds was done very generally at this stage due to lack of confidence in available observational data. Total and high cloud fractions were compared to ISCCP estimates. Warm tropical oceans appear to have too much high cloud. Evaluation of low cloud fraction is less straightforward but it is clear that due to lack of a shallow convection scheme and coarse vertical resolution, the GCM is almost devoid of low clouds over cool oceans. Cloud radiative forcing CRF from the GCM was compared to CRF obtained from ERBE data. Globally averaged, net CRF is in excellent accord with observations but shortwave and longwave CRFs are too strong. Zonal averages, however, reveal biases in which clouds act to cool the Tropics too much and cool the high latitudes too little during summer, yet they warm polar regions too much during winter. Regional examination shows that these biases are confined largely to oceans. Tropical oceans have excessive shortwave CRF despite good total cloud amounts. This may be due to neglect of cloud geometry effects on solar radiative transfer.

J	Nie, YB; Sun, JQ				Nie, Yanbo; Sun, Jianqi			Increase in summer precipitation over the Sichuan Basin in recent decades and possible causes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												A wet-to-dry shift in summer over the Sichuan Basin (SCB) during the late 20th century was noticed by previous studies. However, this study found that summer precipitation over SCB significantly increases during the past two decades, with an abrupt change point around 2011/2012. An anomalous cyclone over Lake Baikal, accompanied by an anticyclone over southern China, is responsible for the increase in SCB precipitation by inducing anomalous upper-level divergence, mid-level ascending motion and moisture convergence. Such atmospheric circulation anomalies are closely associated with the sea surface temperature (SST) warming over the Barents-Kara Sea (BKS). Observational analyses and model experiments indicate that the SST warming over the BKS warms local atmosphere and weakens meridional air temperature gradients over northern Asia and induces local anomalous easterlies, which further induce the anomalous cyclone over Lake Baikal that favours SCB precipitation. Additionally, the inhomogeneous warming over Europe increases local meridional air temperature gradients, enhances atmospheric baroclinicity and intensifies local transient eddy activities over central Europe. The intensified transient eddy activities generate negative geopotential height tendency anomalies over northern Europe, which can further excite a Rossby wave train that directly influences SCB precipitation, and can warm the atmosphere above the Kara Sea that indirectly influences SCB precipitation. This study can deepen our understanding of the interdecadal variability of summer precipitation over the SCB.

Comparison of metal(loid) concentrations in water, sediments and fish from two large shallow lakes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Hulun Lake and Taihu Lake are both large shallow lakes in China. In summer and winter of 2009, water, sediments and fish samples were collected from the two lakes and the concentrations of metal(loids) were analyzed. The results demonstrated that aqueous concentrations of arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni) and copper (Cu) in Hulun Lake were significantly higher than those in Taihu Lake. Especially, the As concentrations (about 130 mu g/L) in Hulun Lake dramatically exceeded the permissible level of drinking water. Compared with Taihu Lake, metal(loid) concentrations in the sediments of Hulun Lake were significantly lower, which might have less impacts on the metal exchanges between water and sediments. In contrast, concentrations of the measured metal(loids) (including As) in fish from Hulun Lake and Taihu Lake were comparable, suggesting that the dramatic difference in aqueous and sediment metal(loid) concentrations had less influence on the metal(loid) bioavailability. The higher concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and cations (e.g., Na+, K+ and Mg2+) in lake water might contribute to the reduced metal(loid) bioavailability to fish in Hulun Lake.

Cumulative effects of climate warming and other human activities on freshwaters of Arctic and subarctic North America	AMBIO					7th Royal Colloquium on Arctic Under Stress - A Thawing Tundra	MAY 30-JUN 01, 2005	SWEDEN					Despite their generally isolated geographic locations, the freshwaters of the north are subjected to a wide spectrum of environmental stressors. High-latitude regions are especially sensitive to the effects of recent climatic warming, which have already resulted in marked regime shifts in the biological communities of many Arctic lakes and ponds. Important drivers of these limnological changes have included changes in the amount and duration of snow and ice cover, and, for rivers and lakes in their deltas, the frequency and extent of spring floods. Other important climate-related shifts include alterations in evaporation and precipitation ratios, marked changes in the quality and quantity of lake and river water inflows due to accelerated glacier and permafrost melting, and declining percentages of precipitation that falls as snow. The depletion of stratospheric ozone over the north, together with the clarity of many Arctic lakes, renders them especially susceptible to damage from ultraviolet radiation. In addition, the long-range atmospheric transport of pollutants, coupled with the focusing effects of contaminant transport from biological vectors to some local ecosystems (e.g., salmon nursery lakes, ponds draining seabird colonies) and biomagnification in long food chains, have led to elevated concentrations of many persistent organic pollutants (e.g., insecticides, which have never been used in Arctic regions) and other pollutants (e.g., mercury). Rapid development of gas and oil pipelines, mining for diamonds and metals, increases in human populations, and the development of all-season roads, seaports, and hydroelectric dams will stress northern aquatic ecosystems. The cumulative effects of these stresses will be far more serious than those caused by changing climate alone.

The K was positively correlated to whole-body crude lipid, crude protein, and gross energy content and negatively correlated to whole-body water content for each sampling period of the experiment (days 75, 150 and 225). In contrast, there was only a weak positive correlation between K and whole-body ash content. While per cent water content was negatively correlated with crude lipid, crude protein and gross energy content for each of the three sampling periods, the correlation between this predictor and ash content was only weakly negative.

We updated biological inputs to account for recent changes in the food webs and used temperature inputs in response to regional climate observed in the baseline period (1964-1993) and projected in the future period (2043-2070). Bioenergetics simulations were run across multiple age-classes and across all four seasons in different scenarios of prey availability. Due to the increased capacity of prey consumption, future growth and consumption by these salmonines were projected to increase substantially when prey availability was not limited. When prey consumption remained constant, future growth of these salmonines was projected to decrease in most cases but increase in some cases where the increase in metabolic cost can be compensated by the decrease in waste (egestion and excretion) loss. Consumption by these salmonines was projected to increase the most during spring and fall when prey energy densities are relatively high. Such seasonality benefits their future growth through increasing annual gross energy intake. Our results indicated that lake trout and steelhead would be better adapted to the warming climate than Chinook salmon. To maintain baseline growth into the future, an increase of 10 % in baseline prey consumption was required for Chinook salmon but considerably smaller increases, or no increases, in prey consumption were needed by lake trout and steelhead.

J	Yu, G; Harrison, SP				Yu, G; Harrison, SP			An evaluation of the simulated water balance of Eurasia and northern Africa at 6000 y BP using lake status data	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Changes in the water balance of Eurasia and northern Africa in response to insolation forcing at 6000 y BP simulated by five atmospheric general circulation models have been compared with observations of changes in lake status. All of the simulations show enhancement of the Asian summer monsoon and of the high pressure cells over the Pacific and Central Asia and the Middle East, causing wetter conditions in northern India and southern China and drier conditions along the Chinese coast and west of the monsoon core. All of the models show enhancement of the African monsoon, causing wetter conditions in the zone between ca 10-20 degrees N. Four of the models show conditions wetter than present in southern Europe and drier than present in northern Europe. Three of the models show conditions similar to present in the mid-latitude continental interior, while the remaining models show conditions somewhat drier than present. The extent and location of each of the simulated changes varies between the models, as does the mechanism producing these changes. The lake data confirm some features of the simulations, but indicate discrepancies between observed and simulated climates. For example, the data show: (1) conditions wetter than present in central Asia, from India to northern China and Mongolia, indicating that the simulated Asian monsoon expansion is too small; (2) conditions wetter than present between ca. 10-30 degrees N in Africa, indicating that the simulated African monsoon expansion is too small; (3) that northern Europe was drier, but the area of significantly drier conditions was more localized (around the Baltic) than shown in the simulations; (4) that southern Europe was wetter than present, apparently consistent with the simulations, but pollen data suggest that this reflects an increase in summer rainfall whereas the models show winter precipitation, and (5) that the midlatitude continental interior was generally wetter than present.					; Harrison, Sandy/ADX-4692-2022	Harrison, Sandy/0000-0001-5687-1903; 													0930-7575	1432-0894				OCT	1996	12	11					723	735		10.1007/s003820050139	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s003820050139													WOS:A1996VN77300001

Its total length is more than 1,790 kilometers, 10 times longer than the Suez Canal, 20 times longer than the Panama Canal, and it is the world's longest man-made canal. It goes through 2500 years since Chinese Spring and Autumn period as an inland river, which had played an important role in the field of canal navigation, military affairs, political affair and culture in the past 2500 years. Until now, the Jining to Hangzhou part of the canal (900 km in length) isn't only the main artery for "north to south coal transportation project", "south to north commissariat transportation project" and "south to north water transfer project", but also the only traffic and transportation network which interlaces rivers, lakes and channels together in China. The purpose of this paper expounded present water pollution situation in each section, analyzed the future trend of water environment and its challenges, urged the importance and urgency to protect the Jing Hang Grand Canal environmental. Rational proposals for the remediation of water pollution were suggested. This paper has the realistic meaning for the economic sustainable development of the Jing Hang Grand Canal region and its surrounding cities under the rapid urbanization in China.

Previous geochemical studies of the area attempted to reconcile different hot spring compositions on the western and eastern sides of the valley using scenarios of dilution, equilibration at low temperatures, surface evaporation, and differences in rock type along flow paths. These models were primarily supported using classical geothermometry methods, and generally assumed that fluids in the Lake City mud volcano area on the western side of the valley best reflect the composition of a deep geothermal fluid. In this contribution, we address controls on hot spring compositions using a different suite of geochemical tools, including optimized multicomponent geochemistry (GeoT) models, hot spring fluid major and trace element measurements, mineralogical observations, and stable isotope measurements of hot spring fluids and precipitated carbonates. We synthesize the results into a conceptual geochemical model of the Surprise Valley geothermal system, and show that high-temperature (quartz, Na/K, Na/K/Ca) classical geothermometers fail to predict maximum subsurface temperatures because fluids re-equilibrated at progressively lower temperatures during outflow, including in the Lake City area. We propose a model where hot spring fluids originate as a mixture between a deep thermal brine and modern meteoric fluids, with a seasonally variable mixing ratio. The deep brine has deuterium values at least 3 to 4 parts per thousand lighter than any known groundwater or high-elevation snow previously measured in and adjacent to SV, suggesting it was recharged during the Pleistocene when meteoric fluids had lower deuterium values. The deuterium values and compositional characteristics of the deep brine have only been identified in thermal springs and groundwater samples collected in proximity to structures that transmit thermal fluids, suggesting the brine may be thermal in nature. On the western side of the valley at the Lake City mud volcano, the deep brine-meteoric water mixture subsequently boils in the shallow subsurface, precipitates calcite, and re-equilibrates at about 130 degrees C. On the eastern side of the valley, meteoric fluid mixes to a greater extent with the deep brine, cools conductively without boiling, and the composition is modified as dissolved elements are sequestered by secondary minerals that form along the cooling and outflow path at temperatures <130 degrees C. Re-equilibration of geothermal fluids at lower temperatures during outflow explains why subsurface temperature estimates based on classical geothermometry methods are highly variable, and fail to agree with temperature estimates based on dissolved sulfate-oxygen isotopes and results of classical and multi component geothermometry applied to reconstructed deep well fluids. The proposed model is compatible with the idea suggested by others that thermal fluids on the western and eastern side of the valley have a common source, and supports the hypothesis that low temperature re-equilibration during west to east flow is the major control on hot spring fluid compositions, rather than dilution, evaporation, or differences in rock type.

During this year indeed, numerous seismic events were felt by the local population. These springs, located on the left bank of the Vieze River, outflow from Tertiary flysch of the Helvetic domain. Since 1988, all thermal and subthermal waters of the study area were measured, sampled and analyzed systematically. Their temperatures reach a maximum of 30-degrees-C and the total discharge of the various exsurgences amounts to 1200 l/mn. The water chemistry of Ca-SO4 type with total dissolved solids of 1850 mg/l is characterized by a low content of alkalis and chlorides. The thermal springs temperature and discharge are varying with time and the warm fluids are mixed during their ascent by a cold and dilute groundwater, problably originating from a karstic aquifer in the Malm. The calcium and sulphate come from the dissolution of gypsum and anhydrite present in the Triassic cellular dolomite of the autochthonous cover of the Aiguilles Rouges Massif. The authors present an hypothesis based on the interpretation of hydrogeological, geological, seismic and isotopic data, which suggests a link between these thermal springs and major water losses (> 1 m3/s) at the artificial lake of Salanfe, located 9 km south-east of the spring discharge zone. This hypothesis is supported by several observations: 1) The water losses of the lake of Salanfe do not converge to existing cold springs of the region, as shown by tracer tests carried out during the mid 1950's. This tends to reinforce the hypothesis that the water losses percolate to a deep confined aquifer; 2) The presence in the Salanfe cirque of autochthonous Triassic outcrops from the Helvetic domain, dipping towards the Val d'Illiez area: these layers are responsible for the major water losses of the lake and it is thought that the water flows in the same direction; 3) The abnormally high seismicity recorded in the Val d'Illiez in 1953 at the end of the complete initial filling of the reservoir and the occurence of the thermal springs seem to be contemporaneous; 4) The elevation of the lake catchment basin corresponds to the elevation of the thermal water catchment area, based on stable isotope data; Chemical geothermometers calculations applied to the thermal springs analyses do not indicate a temperature at depth over 35-degrees-C. Nevertheless, due to their yield (1200 l/min) and emergence temperature (30-degrees-C), the geothermal potential of the springs readily available for an integrated exploitation of water and heat of at least 1.7 MW, and should not be neglected.

The socioeconomic implications of declining ice include diminished access to ice-based cultural activities, safety concerns in traversing ice, changes in fisheries, increases in shoreline erosion, and declines in water storage. Longer ice-free seasons allow more time and capacity for water to warm, threatening water quality and biodiversity. Food webs likely will reorganize, with constrained availability of ice-associated and cold-water niches, and ice loss will affect the nature, magnitude, and timing of greenhouse gas emissions. Examining these rapidly emerging changes will generate more-complete models of lake dynamics, and transdisciplinary collaborations will facilitate translation to effective management and sustainability.					; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/Y-6135-2019; Jansen, Joachim/IXN-4782-2023; O'Reilly, Catherine/AFZ-5813-2022; McClure, Ryan/AAN-1371-2020	Meyer, Michael/0000-0002-8034-9434; Powers, Stephen/0000-0001-6267-2644; Barrett, David Clem/0000-0001-9038-1860; O'Reilly, Catherine/0000-0001-9685-3697; Knoll, Lesley/0000-0003-0347-5979; Sharma, Sapna/0000-0003-4571-2768; Hampton, Stephanie/0000-0003-2389-4249; McMeans, Bailey/0000-0002-9793-6811; 													0036-8075	1095-9203				OCT	2024	386	6718							eadl3211	10.1126/science.adl3211	http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adl3211								39388548					WOS:001422132300006

Feeding ecology of invasive age-0 white perch and native white bass after two decades of co-existence in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron	Aquatic Invasions												The diets and energy content of sympatric populations of invasive age-0 white perch Morone americana and native age-0 white bass Morone chrysops were evaluated in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron following >20 years of coexistence. Fish were collected during July-November in 2009 and 2010 to assess seasonal and interannual patterns of diet composition, diet similarity, feeding strategy and energy density for the two species. The diet composition by weight of age-0 white bass was dominated by various zooplankton taxa, fish, or emergent insects, depending on the month and year. Although fish occasionally comprised a large fraction of the diet biomass, they were eaten by <24% of white bass each month. The diet composition of age-0 white perch shifted from one dominated by chironomids and other benthic macroinvertebrates in 2009 to one largely consisting of Daphnia spp. in 2010. There was more overlap in standardized diet assemblages in 2010 than in 2009 due to the increased importance of Daphnia spp. in white perch diets in 2010. Contrary to expectations, complete separation of diets was not a requirement that enabled the long-term coexistence of invasive white perch and native white bass in Saginaw Bay. Both age-0 white bass and white perch had a mixed feeding strategy with varying degrees of specialization and generalization on different prey. The inter-annual variation in prey, i.e., higher densities of zooplankton in 2009 and chironomids in 2010, is directly opposite of the pattern observed in white perch diets, i.e., diets dominated by chironomids in 2009 and zooplankton in 2010. Energy density increased from July into autumn/fall for both species suggesting that food limitation was not severe.

The hydraulic controls at Sault St Marie and Niagara Falls are simulated using an internal flow boundary approach with the observed flow. The model is shown to exhibit good skills for total water level (TWL) and temperature, with RMSE of 9.5 cm for TWL and similar to 1.6 degrees C for surface temperature and temperature profiles from a 60-day simulation. Sensitivity results reveal the importance of hydrologic forcing even for this short-term simulation. Results from a 210-day simulation indicate that the model is capable of capturing major lake-wide circulation patterns discussed in previous studies and providing further details in those patterns. The new model can potentially serve as a base to unify Great Lakes modeling while simultaneously providing flexibility for site specific studies in any areas of interest.

It lives offshore throughout almost the entire year, showing a remarkable diel vertical migration. In early spring, males and females migrate to lake shore to spawn under stones. Spawning season is limited to a very short span of time in early spring, late April to early May. During this short spawning season, the male is supposed to have only 2 brood cycles at maximum. At each brood cycle, the male is strictly monogynous, never accepting additional females. Males therefore show a marked mate choice, choosing a larger female regardless of the size of the male himself. Females also choose larger males. However, males are supposed to not waste time in male-male fighting in the natural spawning area. That this very short spawning season and its occurrence in early spring is primarily to avoid interspecific competition with another littorally reproducing goby Yoshinobori, Rhinogobius brunneus, is experimentally demonstrated.																			0289-0771	1439-5444				DEC	1987	5	2					185	196		10.1007/BF02349951	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02349951													WOS:A1987L391900011

The sedimentation flux of P was significantly correlated with the overlying chlorophyll-a concentration. The box model provided a good estimate of the summer-averaged water flux. The P mass balance method yielded the release flux of P, which approximated the observed value. For the P exchange between the Inohana Lake Estuary and Hamana Bay, on the net flux, particulate P flows out into Hamana Bay through the upper layer, while dissolved P (phosphate P) flows into the Inohana Lake Estuary through the lower layer. For the P exchange between the upper and lower layers, the upward transport of P from the lower layer was more than 10 (similar to 100) times greater than the downward transport of P. The results showed that P accumulates in the bottom sediment during the summer. This study indicates the possibility that the P input from Hamana Bay is dominant over the river P input in summer season with significant density stratification.																			2166-4250	1793-6292				SEP	2010	52	3					195	213		10.1142/S0578563410002178	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0578563410002178													WOS:000284005900001
J	Orderud, GI; Vogt, RD				Orderud, Geir Inge; Vogt, Rolf D.			Trans-disciplinarity required in understanding, predicting and dealing with water eutrophication	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY												Eutrophication remains a challenge for water quality, and leaching of phosphorus (P) from agriculture remains usually the determining factor as point source emissions of sewage are mainly under control. The Morsa watershed, southeast of Oslo, is a case in point. In spite of abatement actions during the past 20 years, the total concentration of P in the lake has decreased less than expected, causing growing frustration and scepticism among farmers. Hydro-biochemical interactions between phosphate (PO4) and calcium, aluminium and iron in soil and water have produced unexpected results. Decline in acid rain deposition over Norway has reduced the leaching of aluminium into water. This has caused a loss of an important fixation and removal of P by sorption to precipitating aluminium oxy-hydroxides. The combination of more precipitation and higher winter temperatures causes more flushing of P from surface soil horizons. Furthermore, water-logged soil loses much of its ability to hold PO4 in that iron is reduced, thereby allowing more P to escape. Farmers proved to have good agronomical knowledge and are taking part in an active network for spreading of agricultural practices. Reducing the amount of P in fertilizers was accepted fairly easily, whereas minimal autumn tillage has been a much harder task to implement. Therefore, just applying economic incentives will not do; developing basic environmental literacy with an ability to understand feedback loops and rebound effects is necessary. Following this, interaction between science and stakeholders is required, calling for trans-disciplinary research and trans-disciplinary processes.

J	Zhang, DM; Zhou, LZ; Song, YW				Zhang, Dongmei; Zhou, Lizhi; Song, Yunwei			Effect of water level fluctuations on temporal-spatial patterns of foraging activities by the wintering Hooded Crane (Grus monacha)	AVIAN RESEARCH												Background: The Yangtze River floodplain provides important wintering habitats for Hooded Cranes (Grus monacha) in China. Fluctuations in the water level change foraging habitat and food availability, affecting their temporal-spatial patterns of foraging activities. It is of considerable importance to investigate the effect of these fluctuations on food availability for wintering Hooded Cranes and their foraging response to these changes. Understanding their behavior patterns is beneficial in protecting the wintering crane population and restoring their wintering habitats. Methods: A field survey of the winter behavior of cranes was carried out at Shengjin Lake from November in 2013 to April in 2014. Habitat variables, as well as the spatial distribution and behavior patterns of wintering cranes at their foraging sites during five stages of water level fluctuation were collected. Based on this data we analyzed the relationship of foraging behavior relative to water level fluctuations and habitat types. Results: The foraging habitats used by Hooded Cranes varied at the different water level stages. As the water level decreased, the use of meadows and mudflats increased. When the water dropped to its lowest level, the use by the Hooded Crane in the mudflats reached a peak. There were statistically significant differences in time budget in the three types of habitats over the five stages of the water level. In the mudflats, the foraging behavior and maintenance behavior varied significantly with the water level, while the alert behavior showed little variation. Analysis of a generalized linear model showed that the five water level stages and three habitat types had a significant effect on foraging behavior, while the combined effect of these two variables was significant on the foraging time budget and the length of foraging activity of the Hooded Crane. Conclusions: With the decrease in the water level, the use of mudflats by Hooded Cranes increased correspondingly. Food availability in different habitats was affected by changes in the water level. The Hooded Crane adjusted its foraging patterns and made full use of the three available types of habitat in order to acquire enough food in response to fluctuations in the water level.					; Zhou, Lizhi/AAF-4535-2021	zhouZhou, li zhiLizhi/0000-0002-5702-4658; 													2053-7166					AUG 5	2015	6								16	10.1186/s40657-015-0026-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40657-015-0026-x													WOS:000369904400001

An integrated approach with lead isotopes and air back trajectory analysis was used to investigate the monsoon-associated atmospheric transport of PBDEs in tropical/subtropical Asia regions. The air concentration of PBDEs ranged from 1.6 to 57.5 pg m(-3) (15.9 +/- 12.0 pg m(-3)), comparable to reported levels at other remote sites in the world. BDE-209, followed by BDE-47 and -99 dominated the PBDE compositions, indicating a mixed deca- and penta-BDE source. Air mass back trajectory analysis revealed that the major potential source regions of BDE-47 and -99 could be southern China and Thailand, while those of BDE-209 are widely distributed in industrialized and urbanized areas in tropical Asia. The different lead isotope compositions of aerosols between trajectory clusters further substantiated the observation that the South Asian monsoon from spring to summer could penetrate deep into southwestern China, and facilitate long-range transport of airborne pollutants from South Asia.

J	Jeuthe, H; Brännäs, E; Nilsson, J				Jeuthe, Henrik; Brannas, Eva; Nilsson, Jan			Effects of variable egg incubation temperatures on the embryonic development in Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus	AQUACULTURE RESEARCH												An evaluation of different thermal regimes during incubation of Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus L. egg was conducted with regard to embryo survival and development. The study consisted of two major parts: In experiment A, a range of commonly used thermal regimes, constant and variable ranging from 2.7 degrees C to 7 degrees C, were tested for differences in embryo survival and developmental status of newly hatched alevins. Experiment B assessed the timing of a shift from autumn (6 degrees C) to winter temperature (2.5 degrees C) and its effect on embryo survival and the occurrence of spinal deformities in newly hatched alevins. In general, incubations that were initiated at temperatures below 3 degrees C resulted in significantly higher mortality rates and spinal deformity frequencies than other treatments. Hence, Arctic charr eggs require an initial warmer period for unimpaired embryonic development. A general negative correlation was found between the duration of this warmer period (6 degrees C) and both mortality rates and frequency of spinal deformities. The total absence of the 6 degrees C period had the most detrimental effect, with deformity frequencies at least four times higher than all treatments with an initial warmer period. The upper incubation temperature threshold was not reached in the study. The highest temperature tested (7 degrees C) did not result in excess mortality or increased deformity frequency. Higher incubation temperature resulted in less developed alevins at hatching, i.e. alevins were smaller with more yolk remaining. However, measurements on alevins from incubations at variable temperatures revealed different temperature effects on growth and yolk consumption during different parts of embryonic development.																			1355-557X	1365-2109				DEC	2016	47	12					3753	3764		10.1111/are.12825	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.12825													WOS:000387663000006
J	Shi, Y				Shi, Y			Characteristics of late Quaternary monsoonal glaciation on the Tibetan Plateau and in East Asia	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					Meeting on Quaternary Glacial Geology of High Mountains of Asia	JUN, 2000	CHENGDU, PEOPLES R CHINA	Int Geol Correlat Program, Working Grp 2, Glaciat Tibet, Glacial Commiss INQUA, Work Grp 5, Asian Glaciat				Glaciers fed by monsoonal precipitation are mainly located on the Tibetan Plateau and easternmost Asia. These are characterized by simultaneous accumulation and ablation in summer season. The southeast part of the Tibetan Plateau experiences monsoonal precipitation in excess of 1000 mm/yr resulting in maritime temperate glaciers. In contrast, precipitation in the middle and northwest part of the Tibet Plateau decreases from 1000 to 200 mm/yr, resulting in the formation of continental cold glaciers. During the last glacial, the regions of heavy monsoonal precipitation were restricted to the southeast corner of the Plateau. The westerly weak precipitation zone shifted southward, and occupied the major northwest part of the Plateau, where the extreme continental type glaciers greatly expanded. In the eastern margin of Asia including Taiwan, Central Japan, Hokkaido and probably Mount Changbai, maritime type glaciers were more extensive because of higher monsoonal precipitation, especially heavy snowfall in northwest Japan owing to the rich moisture content of the winter monsoon over the Japan Sea. The millennial scale monsoon intensity and glacial cycle in the Tibetan Plateau are strongly affected by the precession cycle and the orbit-inclination cycle which dominate the solar irradiance variation in low latitudes, as the high radiation and strong monsoon caused the warmer and wetter climate during 40-30ka. The low radiation produced a weak monsoon and large depression of temperature and precipitation around 21 ka. This climatic pattern differs from that in the high latitudes where the eccentricity cycle is prominent. The temperature during the last glacial maximum (LGM) was 6-9degreesC lower than today on the Tibetan Plateau and the equilibrium line altitude was depressed by about 1000m in the southeast part, and in the east, south and west margins of the Plateau where precipitation was high. The equilibrium line depression was 500-300 m in the inner and especially the west part of the Plateau. This variation in equilibrium lines might be caused by the combined effect of the decrease in precipitation, the expansion of extreme continental glaciers and the active uplift of glaciated mountains. The estimation of a glaciated area of about 350,000 km(2) in the Tibetan Plateau and roughly 500,000 km(2) in High Asia based on observations of prominent features of LGM glacier extension, may be the direct evidence that shows there was no Quaternary unified ice sheet developed in the Tibetan Plateau.

The relationships of the three types of NCCV intensity with atmospheric circulations in late summer, the sea surface temperature (SST), and Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) in the preceding months, are analyzed. The sensitivity tests by the Community Atmosphere Model version 5.3 (CAM5.3) are used to verify the statistical results. The results show that the coordination pattern of East Asia-Pacific (EAP) and Lake Baikal high pressure forced by SST anomalies in the North Indian Ocean dipole mode (NIOD) during the preceding April and SIC anomalies in the Nansen Basin during the preceding June results in an intensity anomaly for the first type of NCCV. While the pattern of high pressure over the Urals and Okhotsk Sea and low pressure over Lake Baikal during late summer-which is forced by SST anomalies in the South Indian Ocean dipole mode (SIOD) in the preceding June and SIC anomalies in the Barents Sea in the preceding April-causes the intensity anomaly of the second type. The third type is atypical and is not analyzed in detail. Sensitivity tests, jointly forced by the SST and SIC in the preceding period, can well reproduce the observations. In contrast, the results forced separately by the SST and SIC are poor, indicating that the NCCV during late summer is likely influenced by the coordinated effects of both SST and SIC in the preceding months.

Meteorological Factors Affecting Airport Operations during the Winter Season in the Midwest	WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY												During the coldest months of the year, weather systems bring a variety of winter weather to most of the continental United States in the form of snow, sleet, and freezing rain, which along with strong winds, low clouds, and reduced visibilities may create dangerous conditions. These weather conditions can result in major disruptions in air travel, leading to delays and cancellations of hundreds or thousands of flights, thus affecting the plans of millions of travelers. To assess the specific meteorological factors that prompt flight delays and cancellations in the Midwest region of the United States during wintertime, a comprehensive study was performed on nine of the largest airports (by passenger boardings) in the area. Flight delay and cancellation data from 11 winter seasons (2005-06 to 2015-16) were collected from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) and analyzed along with climatological data from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). A classification scheme was developed, and each flight was categorized according to the meteorological factor that could have prompted its delay. The results of the study revealed that visibility was the main meteorological factor affecting midwestern airports, with low ceilings as a close second. Blizzards were the main cause for flight cancellations.																			1948-8327	1948-8335				APR	2018	10	2					307	322		10.1175/WCAS-D-17-0054.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/WCAS-D-17-0054.1													WOS:000434202600009

We used an ensemble of vertical one-dimensional hydrodynamic lake models driven with regional climate projections to calculate water temperature, stratification, and ice cover under the A1B emission scenario for the German drinking water reservoir Lichtenberg. We used an analysis of variance method to estimate the contributions of the considered sources of uncertainty on the ensemble output. For all simulated variables, epistemic uncertainty, which is related to the model structure, is the dominant source throughout the simulation period. Nonetheless, the calculated trends are coherent among the five models and in line with historical observations. The ensemble predicts an increase in surface water temperature of 0.34 K per decade, a lengthening of the summer stratification of 3.2 days per decade, as well as decreased probabilities of the occurrence of ice cover and winter inverse stratification by 2100. These expected changes are likely to influence the water quality of the reservoir. Similar trends are to be expected in other reservoirs and lakes in comparable regions.					; Feldbauer, Johannes/NHP-9703-2025; Petzoldt, Thomas/C-6198-2009	Berendonk, Thomas/0000-0002-9301-1803; Mesman, Jorrit/0000-0002-4319-260X; Moore, Tadhg/0000-0002-3834-8868; Ladwig, Robert/0000-0001-8443-1999; Petzoldt, Thomas/0000-0002-4951-6468; Feldbauer, Johannes/0000-0002-8238-5375													1015-1621	1420-9055				OCT	2022	84	4							50	10.1007/s00027-022-00883-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-022-00883-2													WOS:000844529000002
J	Neelmeijer, J; Motagh, M; Wetzel, HU				Neelmeijer, Julia; Motagh, Mahdi; Wetzel, Hans-Ulrich			Estimating Spatial and Temporal Variability in Surface Kinematics of the Inylchek Glacier, Central Asia, using TerraSAR-X Data	REMOTE SENSING												We use 124 scenes of TerraSAR-X data that were acquired in 2009 and 2010 to analyse the spatial and temporal variability in surface kinematics of the debris-covered Inylchek Glacier, located in the Tien Shan mountain range in Central Asia. By applying the feature tracking method to the intensity information of the radar data and combining the results from the ascending and descending orbits, we derive the surface velocity field of the glaciated area. Analysing the seasonal variations over the upper part of the Southern Inylchek branch, we find a temperature-related increase in velocity from 25 cm/d up to 50 cm/d between spring and summer, with the peak occurring in June. Another prominent velocity peak is observable one month later in the lower part of the Southern Inylchek branch. This area shows generally little motion, with values of approximately 5-10 cm/d over the year, but yields surface kinematics of up to 25 cm/d during the peak period. Comparisons of the dates of annual glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) of the proglacial Lake Merzbacher suggest that this lower part is directly influenced by the drainage, leading to the observed mini-surge, which has over twice the normal displacement rate. With regard to the GLOF and the related response of Inylchek Glacier, we conclude that X-band radar systems such as TerraSAR-X have a high potential for detecting and characterising small-scale glacial surface kinematic variations and should be considered for future inter-annual glacial monitoring tasks.					; Motagh/AAX-2406-2021	Motagh, Mahdi/0000-0001-7434-3696; 														2072-4292				OCT	2014	6	10					9239	9259		10.3390/rs6109239	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs6109239													WOS:000344458000005

ANIMALS												Understanding the migratory strategies of plateau-endemic species is essential for informing effective conservation, especially under climate change. The Black-necked Crane (Grus nigricollis), a high-altitude specialist, has shown notable population growth in recent years. We analysed satellite tracking data from 16 individuals of a western subpopulation in the lake basin region of northern Tibet (2021-2024), focusing on migration patterns, stopover use, and habitat selection. This subpopulation exhibited short-distance (mean: 284.21 km), intra-Tibet migrations with low reliance on stopover sites. Autumn migration was shorter, more direct, higher in altitude, and slower in speed than spring migration. Juveniles used smaller, more fragmented habitats than subadults, and their spatial range expanded over time. Given these patterns, we infer that the short-distance migration strategy may reduce energetic demands and mortality risks while increasing route flexibility-characteristics that may benefit population growth. We refer to this as a low-energy, high-efficiency migration strategy, which we hypothesise could support faster population growth and enhance resilience to environmental change. We recommend prioritizing the conservation of short-distance migration corridors, such as the typical lake basin area in northern Tibet-Yarlung Tsangpo River system, which may help sustain plateau-endemic migratory populations under future climate scenarios.

In the Northern Hemisphere, an increase in average air temperatures is observed, which implies the occurrence of a shorter period of snow and ice cover during the winter season. The winter 2019/2020 was unusual, because that was the first time in the record, that a complete lack of permanent ice cover was observed on numerous lakes in Poland. Such unusual conditions could influence lake functioning. Hence we analyzed the chemistry of the water-sediment interface (near-bottom and interstitial water and sediment) in the shallow, eutrophic Mielenko Lake (area 7.9 ha, max depth 1.9 m) in 2013 and 2019-2022 period to assess the influence of prolonged water circulation on the bottom zone. Mielenko Lake was subjected to a phosphorus inactivation procedure using Al and Fe salts (PAX 18, PIX 111) in 2020 and 2021. Our research revealed that unusually prolonged winter circulation caused a significant decrease in organic matter content in bottom sediment in 2020, as well as a decrease in NaOH-nrP fraction and TP amounts. That effect was short-term and it did not significantly influence the NaOH-rP fraction amounts. The released P was probably built in macrophytes biomass during vegetation season, because P inactivation has been limiting phytoplankton proliferation, and it favored shifting to a clearwater state with macrophytes domination. This was confirmed by decreasing in phytoplankton biomass, and a massive expansion of the macrophytes range noted in the second year of restoration. Our study shows, that P inactivation could mitigate the negative effects of warm winters in shallow lakes.

J	Wick, L; Lemcke, G; Sturm, M				Wick, L; Lemcke, G; Sturm, M			Evidence of Lateglacial and Holocene climatic change and human impact in eastern Anatolia: high-resolution pollen, charcoal, isotopic and geochemical records from the laminated sediments of Lake Van, Turkey	HOLOCENE												Annually laminated sediments from Lake Van, spanning about 13000 varve years, were sampled for stable-isotopic, geochemical, pollen and charcoal analyses in order to find evidence of past regional climatic changes and human impact in the semi-arid region of eastern Anatolia, Turkey. The Lateglacial period was cold and dry, with steppe vegetation and saline lake water. During the Younger Dryas the lake level dropped dramatically, and the vegetation turned to a semi-desert. Geochemical and isotopic records indicate a strong increase in moisture at the onset of the Holocene, and Artemisia-chenopod steppes were partly replaced by grass steppe and pistachio scrub. A delay of about 3000 years in the expansion of deciduous oak woodlands and high steppe-fire frequencies suggest dry spring and summer weather during the early Holocene. At 8200 yr BP, a shift in the regional climate regime facilitated the transport of more moisture into the interior areas of the Taurus mountains and caused a change in the seasonal distribution of precipitation. The steppe-forests dominated by Quercus advanced and reached their maximum extention at about 6200 yr BP. All the proxy data indicate optimum climatic conditions, low water salinity and high lake level between 6200 and 4000 yr BP. After 4000 yr BP, aridity increased again and the modern climatic situation was established. Human impact in the catchment of Lake Van started at 3800 yr BP and was intensified during the last 600 years.																			0959-6836					SEP	2003	13	5					665	675		10.1191/0959683603hl653rp	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683603hl653rp													WOS:000185320000004

Characterizing lentic habitats in golf courses and adjacent green spaces: water quality, water chemistry, pesticide concentrations, and algal concentrations	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												As human-dominated land-use increases globally, urbanization is a prominent cause of a decline in natural areas, including lentic ecosystems (i.e. lakes, ponds and wetlands). Lentic ecosystems in urban green spaces, such as parks, golf courses or forest preserves, could provide important habitat for organisms within the urban matrix. However, there is a lack of data comparing lentic habitats across these land-use types. We quantified the area of golf courses and forest preserve habitats in the Chicago Metropolitan Region. We measured pesticide concentrations, water chemistry, physicochemical parameters and algal composition in lentic habitats of golf courses and forest preserves in the spring and summer of 2017. Permanent ponds, whether located within a golf course or forest preserve, had similar water quality, chemistry and chlorophyll a and phycocyanin, but differed from ephemeral ponds in forest preserves. Pesticide concentrations within golf course ponds were found in 11 of 25 courses, but only three pesticides (out of 10 measured) were detected. These data suggest golf courses can provide lentic habitats of similar quality to other adjacent land-use types. Additional study is needed to document their role in providing habitat for aquatic biota and sustaining ecosystem services in urban landscapes.

J	SCHINDLER, DW				SCHINDLER, DW			EXPERIMENTAL PERTURBATIONS OF WHOLE LAKES AS TESTS OF HYPOTHESES CONCERNING ECOSYSTEM STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION	OIKOS												Production, respiration, nutrient concentrations and changes in biological communities were monitored for several years in two experimentally eutrophied and two experimentally acidified lakes in the Experimental Lakes Area, Canada. Results were examined to detect changes in ecosystem structure and function that might be sensitive indicators of ecosystem stress. Phytoplankton production in eutrophied lakes was higher than in reference lakes. It decreased quickly to background values when fertilization was terminated. Winter respiration was unchanged, P/R ratios were constant under constant N/P fertilization, but decreased for three years after the N/P ratio in fertilizer was decreased from 14:1 to 5:1 by weight. Phytoplankton production was not affected by acidification to a pH of 5.0. Winter respiration declined at pH values of 5.1 and below, causing P/R to be highest at the lowest pH values. Respiration returned to normal when the pH of the lake was increased to 5.4. Gross periphyton production and respiration both increased with acidification, but P/R ratios declined at pH values below 6.2. Nitrification in both acidified lakes ceased at pH values of 5.4 to 5.7. It recovered when pH was allowed to increase, but with a time lag of one year. No other nutrient cycles appeared to be disrupted. Both eutrophication and acidification caused declines in species diversity among several taxonomic groups. AMong phytoplankton, both stresses caused an increase in size of organisms in summer. Among higher taxa, there was not a consistent tendency for either small or large organisms to be favored. Periphyton metabolism was the most sensitive indicator of acidification, followed by taxonomic changes in several groups. Ecosystem-level production and respiration were the most resistant properties to acid stress. The earliest serious changes in ecosystems and food webs occurred when acidification eliminated acid-sensitive organisms that were also the sole occupants of key ecological niches. Such situations occur frequently in northern lakes.

However, there is still limited data on their biota in Serbia, which is especially true for aquatic macroinvertebrates, including chironomids (Diptera: Chironomidae). Here we investigated diversity and seasonal variations of chironomid community in six salt marshes distributed in the northern and southern part of Serbia. We recorded a total of 25 taxa, of which two are new for the Serbian chironomid fauna. Most of the recorded species are common in freshwaters and six of them are halotolerant. Chironomid community structure fluctuated in relation to the seasons. The highest diversity was recorded in the spring and summer months for the majority of studied salt marshes. Low diversity and dominance of halotolerant taxa were recorded in Pannonian salt marshes in the northern part of the country, suggesting higher salinity of these habitats comparing to the southern ones. The present findings represent the first inventory of chironomid larvae for these unique and highly endangered habitats in Serbia, which can help to fill the gaps in the knowledge of distributional ranges of halotolerant and halophilic species and provide baseline for future surveys.

J	Roy, JW; Hayashi, M				Roy, James W.; Hayashi, Masaki			Multiple, distinct groundwater flow systems of a single moraine-talus feature in an alpine watershed	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Recent studies suggest that talus slopes and moraines likely play an important role in groundwater flow and storage in alpine watersheds, though the subsurface processes of these unconsolidated sediment features are not fully understood. To gain insight into these groundwater systems, we investigated the spatial variability in groundwater properties and hydrological trends of a large spring and several nearby (<= 200 m) springs, discharging from a single moraine-talus feature in an alpine watershed in the Canadian Rockies. A key question was whether groundwater flow in these features is reasonably homogeneous. Hydrograph analyses revealed at least two different groundwater responses to precipitation and melt imputs: a rapid and likely localized response and a slower response indicating a subsurface connection to a nearby lake. There was also a large spread in groundwater composition across the large spring and between springs, including a consistent linear trend in major ion chemistry over a 20-m section of the large spring. The spatial and temporal trends in groundwater chemistry data suggests there are three groundwater components associated with this sediment feature, and that their relative contributions vary temporally, though the component associated with the lake appears dominant. The study findings suggest that unconsolidated sediment features can possess multiple, and possibly disconnected, groundwater flow paths exhibiting unique hydrological and geochemical characteristics, and cannot necessarily be treated as a single, homogeneous groundwater component when modeling the hydrology of alpine watersheds.

J	Rowe, DK; Taumoepeau, A				Rowe, DK; Taumoepeau, A			Decline of common smelt (Retropinna retropinna) in turbid, eutrophic lakes in the North Island of New Zealand	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Densities of larval smelt (Retropinna retropinna) and common bullies ( Gobiomorphus cotidianus) were estimated by a closing Wisconsin drop-net on two occasions following the spring/summer spawning season in 11 geographically localised lakes varying in size and trophic status. Mean densities of smelt ranged from 0 to 65 fish m(-2) and were directly related to water clarity as determined by secchi disc depth. In contrast, densities of larval bullies ranged from 0 to 117 fish m(-2) and were inversely related to water clarity. Larval smelt dominated in all the clear water, oligotrophic lakes, but bullies dominated in lakes where water clarity was less than 6 m. The depth distribution and depth range for schools of juvenile smelt was also reduced in turbid lakes. As the ability of juvenile smelt to feed on zooplankton is not reduced by turbidity, and as predation by trout on smelt decreases in turbid lakes, these two factors are not responsible for the decline of smelt in the more turbid, productive lakes. We propose that reduced larval recruitment caused by a higher egg mortality is responsible. A higher egg mortality would be expected in such lakes because of increased siltation of littoral spawning substrates, and increased predation by common bullies.																			0018-8158					JUL	2004	523	1-3					149	158		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000033102.71959.dc	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000033102.71959.dc													WOS:000222264300014

Migratory frugivores, through their seasonal movements, connect distant plant populations, but their roles in plant-bird interaction networks remain poorly quantified amid global declines in migratory bird populations. How these birds mediate plant-animal interactions across space and time, and how they functionally differ from residents, remains unclear. Using arboreal camera trapping over three fruiting seasons (2019-2022), we recorded 10,992 interactions (343 unique links) between 31 fleshy-fruited plants and 48 bird species (15 migratory, 33 resident) across 13 reservoir islands in the Thousand Island Lake of China. Migratory birds accounted for 14 % of all interactions, with 99.3 % occurring during the autumn/winter fruiting peaks (October-January), and interacted with 67.7 % of the plant species. Despite their lower overall richness, smaller islands (<10 ha) hosted 43 % of migratory interactions, highlighting their importance as stopover sites. In contrast, larger islands (>30 ha) supported more frugivore richness but lower migratory proportions, acting as refugia for residents. Network analyses showed no significant differences in species roles (degree, species strength, specialization d') between migratory and resident birds though migrants expanded the spatial and temporal scope of seed dispersal. These findings challenge area-centric conservation priorities by revealing the complementary roles of small and large islands. We advocate conserving island networks through seasonal management aligned with fruiting phenology, restoring native fruiting plants with staggered phenologies to buffer climate-driven mismatches, and enhancing habitat connectivity to sustain seed dispersal and ecosystem resilience in fragmented landscapes.

Spatial ecology of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) in Lake Winnipeg and its potential for management actions	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Common carp feeding and spawning behaviours negatively impact the functioning of marsh ecosystems. In the Netley-Libau Marsh, situated on the southern end of Lake Winnipeg, water level regulations, non point source nutrient pollution, and the non-native common carp are thought to be the main contributors to the degradation of the marsh habitat. Using acoustic telemetry, we analysed the movement rate, frequency and timing of suspected spawning migrations, spatial ecology, and aggregation of common carp in the Lake Winnipeg drainage over a three year time period. Common carp moved the farthest during the open water period when water temperature was >5 degrees C. Their annual migration into Netley-Libau Marsh was correlated to ordinal date. Common carp left the marsh in late spring/early summer, presumably feeding in Lake Winnipeg, before moving to overwintering sites situated in Traverse Bay and Lake Winnipeg, where they arrived typically by October and formed aggregations. These findings will inform habitat and fisheries managers in the effort to undertake evidence-based management actions.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Precipitation on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) exert great impacts on the energy, water cycle, and regional ecosystem. But due to the wide differences in climate regimes and complicated topography, TP precipitation is characterized as greater spatial diversity and lower confidence of temporal tendency. Based on the precipitation datasets from in situ observations, reanalysis, and satellites, this study identifies the interdecadal shift of the summer precipitation trends in the southern and northern TP, which corresponds well with the remarkable changes of TP lakes area in recent years. The statistical results indicate that the TP summer precipitation has experienced an interdecadal transition in the late 1990s, with precipitation increasing and then decreasing in the southern TP, and decreasing and then increasing in the northern TP. Further analyses suggest that the changes in moisture budget and convection activities play an important role in the interdecadal variations of precipitation in the northern and southern TP, respectively. More specifically, the variations in the southern TP are contributed largely by the persistent weakening sensible heat source, which can depress the ascending motion and hinder the northward moisture transport in the southern TP. While in the northern TP, both observations and model sensitivity experiments indicate that the co-effect of the cold interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO) and warm Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) has profound impacts on the decadal shift of the net moisture budget in the northern TP. Specifically, the AMO can impact the Lake Baikal anticyclone through the anomalous wave propagation and then decrease the moisture output in the eastern TP. While the IPO can weaken the climatological westerlies and prompt the moisture to get stuck in the northern TP. Consequently, the variations in the net moisture budget can give rise to the decadal variations in summer precipitation in the northern TP.

Typical Rossby numbers calculated from velocity data, combined with a scaling analysis of the governing equations of motion, reveal that these currents are geostrophic. Continuous temperature readings from high spatial and temporal resolution thermistor chain data demonstrate, in general, downward and upward isotherm tilting in the upper and lower sections respectively of the fluid column (convex) for one winter campaign and roughly the opposite to the other. The form of the hydrostatic pressure gradients, and deformation of the interior thermal field associated with these, in each case provides evidence of anti-cyclonic/cyclonic gyres propagating around the lake edge due to the fundamental control of the Coriolis acceleration. One of these modes of physical behaviour confirms the direction of circulation hypothesised by previous numerical modelling studies but comparisons between two winters suggest that a strong effect on the direction of the gyres is due to the initial thermal stratification during the frozen period.

J	Gürsoy-Ergen, A				Gursoy-Ergen, Arzu			Hope for the White-headed Duck, Oxyura leucocephala (Aves: Anatidae) in Turkey despite a declining breeding population and abandonment of its traditional wintering area?	ZOOLOGY IN THE MIDDLE EAST												The development of the breeding and non-breeding populations of the White-headed Duck, Oxyura leucocephala, in Turkey was analysed based on all available records from the period 1966-2016 from 99 different areas. Breeding is confined to Inner Anatolia and the eastern parts of the country. The breeding population had been estimated as 200-250 pairs in the period 1996-2001 but recent observations show that it does now not exceed 80-125 pairs which is a decline of about 50% within two decades. The non-breeding winter population comprises approximately 8,500-10,000 individuals. Burdur Lake has traditionally housed more than 90% of the population but is no longer a significant resting place. The numbers started to decrease from more than 10,000 birds at the beginning of the 1990s to a few hundred in the early 2000s. Now only very small numbers overwinter there. The reason seems to be a combination of water pollution and decreasing water level. After a period of more than 10 years, the numbers in Turkey started to increase again, and most birds are now concentrated at Manyas Lake in Western Anatolia. In 2016, the population reached a winter maximum of approximately 6,000. In the post-breeding season, up to 4,000 individuals were recorded in Eastern Anatolia in October 2014 which is far more than has ever been recorded in this season before.

Trends and Variability of North American Cool-Season Extratropical Cyclones: 1979-2019	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Extratropical cyclones are the primary driver of sensible weather conditions across the midlatitudes of North America, often generating various types of precipitation, gusty nonconvective winds, and severe convective storms throughout portions of the annual cycle. Given ongoing modifications of the zonal atmospheric thermal gradient resulting from anthropogenic forcing, analyzing the historical characteristics of these systems presents an important research question. Using the North American Regional Reanalysis, boreal cool-season (October-April) extratropical cyclones for the period 1979-2019 were identified, tracked, and classified on the basis of their genesis location. In addition, bomb cyclones-extratropical cyclones that recorded a latitude-normalized pressure fall of 24 hPa in 24 h-were identified and stratified for additional analysis. Cyclone life span across the domain exhibits a log-linear relationship, with 99% of all cyclones tracked lasting less than 8 days. On average, approximate to 270 cyclones were tracked across the analysis domain per year, with an average of approximate to 18 yr(-1) being classified as bomb cyclones. The average number of cyclones in the analysis domain has decreased in the last 20 years from 290 per year during 1979-99 to 250 per year during 2000-19. Decreasing trends in the frequency of cyclone track counts were noted across a majority of the analysis domain, with the most significant decreases found in Canada's Northwest Territories, Colorado, and east of the Graah Mountain Range. No significant interannual or spatial trends were noted in the frequency of bomb cyclones.

The Balkan population offers a unique chance to test the effect of breeding range expansion on the genetically programmed migratory direction. We studied 21 paddyfield warblers at Durankulak Lake, NE Bulgaria, by recording their autumn migratory orientation in circular orientation cages. Our data show that the preferred migratory orientation is directed along a NE-SW axis. Paddyfield warblers seem to avoid direct crossing of the Black Sea by following the western coast. The mean bearing was parallel to the nearest coastline and corresponds to the direction of the historical breeding range expansion of the species. In our experiment many individuals showed south-western orientation in autumn, a course which would potentially lead the birds to exploratory movements outside the current breeding range. An axial orientation response has been often shown in circular cage tests, and can be due to factors such as coastal orientation or reverse orientation triggered by the physiological condition of some individuals. However, it might also be one of the driving mechanisms for range expansion. Hence, we can expect the future expansion of Balkan paddyfield warblers to continue towards south-west.

Picocyanobacterial community structure of freshwater lakes and the Baltic Sea revealed by phylogenetic analyses and clade-specific quantitative PCR	MICROBIOLOGY-SGM												Phylogenetic relationships among picocyanobacteria from the Syn/Pro clade sensu Sanchez-Baracaldo et al. (2005) were determined using small subunit (ssu) rDNA sequences from novel culture isolates together with environmental samples from the Baltic Sea and seven freshwater lakes. The picocyanobacterial community comprised members of previously identified clades and of two previously undescribed clades. The number of well-supported clades suggests that freshwater picocyanobacterial communities encompass much greater diversity than is found in marine systems. To allow the quantification of community structure and temporal succession, clade-specific ssu rDNA TaqMan assays were designed and implemented. These assays were used to assess picocyanobacterial community structure in two lakes over an annual cycle in 2003/4, and in a small number of Baltic Sea samples collected in July 2003. In the lake-water samples, picocyanobacteria were found to be scarce during most of the year, with members of each clade reaching their peak abundance over a relatively short period during the summer (June to September), although representatives of the Cyanobium clade also developed an autumn peak extending towards the end of October. All four freshwater clades were present in the Baltic Sea, but their distribution was patchy over relatively short spatial scales. The use of molecular tools for describing and quantifying community structures reveals previously unexplored complexity in the phytoplankton and will facilitate the development of a more sophisticated understanding of community dynamics at the base of the food chains in lakes.					; Sanchez-Baracaldo, Patricia/A-5309-2017	Sanchez-Baracaldo, Patricia/0000-0002-5216-2664; 													1350-0872	1465-2080				NOV	2008	154		11				3347	3357		10.1099/mic.0.2008/019836-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.2008/019836-0								18957588					WOS:000261420600011
J	Niu, QR; Xia, M				Niu, Qianru; Xia, Meng			The behaviors of two limnetic river plumes discharging into the semi-enclosed western basin of Lake Erie during ice-free seasons	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Given the significant ecological implications of coastal plumes, their dispersion and driving mechanisms have been extensively investigated, whereas existing knowledge about the limnetic ones remain unrevealed. Accordingly, this study investigated the behaviors of the Detroit (DRP) and Maumee (MRP) River sediment plumes in the semi-enclosed western basin of Lake Erie on multiple temporal scales. Results demonstrated that the two plumes' dispersions were constrained by the basin's coastlines beyond the advections induced by Ekman currents. The north and west wind forced MRP traveled downstream, while those under the south and east wind propagated upstream. The inter-annual and seasonal variability of MRP sizes are mainly impacted by its river flux, with moderate contributions of zonal wind and the Detroit River flux, resulting in significantly larger spring patches and indicating the potential interactions between the two plumes. On the other hand, DRP paced upstream under the west wind, traveled downstream under the north and east wind, and the south wind induced advection confined it at its river mouth. Its sizes varied with wind forcing and were significantly influenced by wind directions. They had limited inter-annual variations but with prominent seasonality, which featured for small summer surface patches resulting from its negative buoyancy. Overall, this study demonstrated the behavior of two dynamically distinctive limnetic plumes bounded in a semi-enclosed basin, which could further our understanding of plume dynamics in lakes and enclosed environments.																			0272-7714	1096-0015				SEP 5	2021	258								107408	10.1016/j.ecss.2021.107408	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2021.107408		MAY 2021											WOS:000704391100003

Zooplankton biomass and nutrients both varied greatly in these lakes. Factor analysis and multiple linear regression showed that phytoplankton biomass was positively correlated with TN, NH4+, NO3- and TP, while it did not show any negative relationship to zooplankton biomass. Meanwhile, the phytoplankton biomass showed contrary relationships to the mass ratio of TN/TP in spring and summer, suggesting that in nutrient-richer lakes the dominant phytoplankton species have different preferences for TN/TP ratio. The insignificant top-down control of phytoplankton biomass may be attributed to the dominance of small-sized crustaceans and low crustacean biomass resulting from cyanobacterial dominance and planktivorous fish predation as well as other factors. Thus, it is likely that nutrients were more important than zooplankton biomass in explaining the total variance of phytoplaDkton biomass in these subtropical lakes.

J	Bush, ABG				Bush, ABG			CO2/H2O and orbitally driven climate variability over central Asia through the Holocene	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Small variations in Earth's orbit have a direct impact on global climate with the greatest changes occurring over large land masses such as Asia. Orbitally driven climate signals are therefore likely to be identifiable in climate proxy records derived from sediment sections in the continental interior. Proxy records derived from temperature-dependent variables are also likely to display a signal due to temporal variability of atmospheric CO2 and related climatic parameters such as water vapour content. To determine the magnitude of climate anomalies associated with shortwave and longwave radiative forcing over Asia, a suite of numerical atmospheric simulations is performed that spans most of the Holocene (from 10,000 to 2500 years BP) at 500-year intervals. Over central Asia, the amplitude of the summer-winter seasonal cycle is greater than today in all simulations but exhibits two distinct maxima at 9000 and 6000 BP. Simulated precipitation and snow accumulation over central Asia are markedly higher during the early mid Holocene and are oscillatory, exhibiting peaks at 8000-7500 and 4500 BP (the Atlantic and Subboreal times, respectively). CO2/H2O forcing and orbital forcing combine to drive temperature oscillations over central Asia which, in turn, regulate relative humidity and changes in surface hydrology. Correlation between simulated results and proxy records from across Asia suggest that CO2/H2O and orbital forcing are dominant factors driving fluctuations of large-scale, central Asian climate through the Holocene.

J	Koszelnik, P; Tomaszek, JA; Gruca-Rokosz, R				Koszelnik, Piotr; Tomaszek, Janusz A.; Gruca-Rokosz, Renata			The significance of denitrification in relation to external loading and nitrogen retention in a mountain reservoir	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Nitrogen retention ( N-ret) and denitrification were studied in the mesotrophic Solina reservoir ( south-east Poland) between spring and autumn in 2002 and 2003. N-ret was calculated on the basis of the input-output mass balance. The rate of denitrification was measured using the N-15 isotope pairing technique in two types of areas; in deep areas, where the bottom sediment makes contacts with the hypolimnion ( D-prof), and in the unstratified shallows ( D-litt). The calculated daily load of removed nitrogen ( D-tot) varied somewhat from 11.0 to 19.1 mg Nm(-2) day(-1) with a standard deviation of 3.0 mg Nm(-2) day(-1). The limited oscillation noted for D-tot results from the major participation of the deep areas of the reservoir, which are characterised by stable D-prof, as distinct from D-litt, which varied seasonally from 5.8 mg Nm(-2) day(-1) in November to 109.9 mg Nm(-2) day(-1) in August. The primary factor limiting the denitrification rate was temperature, the other being availability of substrates, mainly organic matter. Nitrogen retention ranged seasonally between -25.0 and 175.9 mg Nm(-2) day(-1). The contribution of denitrification to N-ret ranged from 9.0% to 49.8% ( mean 16.4%). On average, only 4.9% of the nitrogen external load was denitrified ( range 2.6-7.9%, s.d. 1.5%). After comparing obtained data with others available in the literature, we concluded that reservoirs, estuaries and highly-loaded lakes in a river system experience a more limited contribution of D-tot to N-load than is the case in natural lakes.

Following adjustments to China's pandemic public policy in December 2022, the effects on water quality and nutrient status in lakes and reservoirs remain unclear. In this study, we collected national environmental monitoring data comprising 15 indicators of water quality, meteorology, soil, and economic factors, from 86 lakes and reservoirs across China between March 2021 and December 2023. Total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), the mass TN/TP ratio (TN/TP), and ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) were selected as representative nutrient indicators. The water quality index (WQI) and multivariate statistical techniques were employed to comprehensively assess national water quality and identify the drivers of nutrient variations in sub-regions. The results show that during the monitoring period from 2021 to 2023, Chinese national water quality consistently fell within the 'good (61-80)' or 'excellent (81-100)' categories, with the lowest water quality observed in the summer of each year. The summer of 2021 recorded the lowest WQI value among all seasons at 75.01. Following the elimination of the COVID-19 epidemic public lockdown policy, concentrations of TN, TP, and NH3-N declined. These findings indicate a general improvement in the water quality of lakes and reservoirs nationwide. Mantel test and multiple stepwise linear regression models revealed significant correlations between nutrients and human activity indicators in central, eastern, and northern China. In northern China, TP showed a significant positive correlation with GDP (0.2 < Mantel's r < 0.5, P < 0.05), with the beta value increasing from 0.27 to 0.38 after the elimination of the COVID-19 epidemic public lockdown policy. In these regions, the influence of rainfall, wind speed, NDVI, surface soil moisture, and water temperature on nutrients shifted from significant to insignificant effects after the elimination of the COVID-19 epidemic public lockdown policy, indicating that human activities have overshadowed natural factors. This study examines the water quality and nutrient status of lakes and reservoirs in China after the elimination of the COVID-19 epidemic public lockdown policy, highlighting the long-term impacts and spatial variations of the pandemic. These findings will inform environmental governance and promote sustainable water resource management in the post-pandemic era.

Post-drainage ice dam response at Lake Merzbacher, Inylchek glacier, Kyrgyzstan	GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												The Inylchek glacier system in Central Tian Shan, Kyrgyzstan, comprises a large glacier-dammed lake which usually drains once a year through a subglacial drainage system. Detailed GPS measurements on the ice dam and the analysis of Aster scenes from several subsequent years provide insight into the post-drainage dam response and the changed ice dynamic conditions. We demonstrate that during high water levels in the lake a large part of the ice dam is afloat, lifting the ice surface up to almost 20 m in the central dam region. During this phase of extensive flotation strong calving is facilitated, which is supported by the high density of ice debris in the lake. In general, surface ice velocities are about 1.5-2 times higher during summer than winter. Closer to the lake, however, ice velocities increase considerably after the drainage event, showing values more than three times the annual mean. The increased mass flux during the phase of high lake level needs to be compensated by replenishment of the lost ice from the dam. Therefore the ice velocities show compressive flow during the remaining part of the year. These results show that Southern Inylchek glacier is strongly influenced by the existence of the lake.

The existence of nitrapyrin- and acetylene-sensitive 14C-bicarbonate incorporation confirmed that bacterial nitrification occurred. During late January to early March (water temperature 2-3.degree.C), nitrification occurred at an average rate of about 13 .mu.g N .cntdot. L-1 .cntdot. d-1 for the years studied. Numbers of detectable nitrifying bacteria appeared too low (by 2 to 4 orders of magnitude) to account for the observed activity. The nitrification activity observed would result in average oxygen consumption amounting to 71% of the observed oxygen depletion. This shows that winter nitrification can be an important factor in promoting oxygen depletion and possibly winter-kill of fish.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				APR	1987	44	4					743	749		10.1139/f87-090	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f87-090													WOS:A1987H801500006

Predicting smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) occurrence across North America under climate change:: a comparison of statistical approaches	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) is a warm-water fish species that is native to central and eastern North America. Climate change scenarios predict further extension northward of suitable habitat for smallmouth bass, which may negatively affect native fish species. We developed and compared predictive models of the distribution of bass in North America using four statistical approaches: logistic regression, classification tree, discriminant analysis, and artificial neural networks. We collected 4181 geo-referenced records of smallmouth bass occurrence and matched them with climate data. Artificial neural networks performed the best with the highest sensitivity (correctly predicting species presence) and specificity (correctly predicting absence), followed by discriminant analysis. Artificial neural networks indicated that winter air temperatures were the most important predictors of smallmouth bass occurrence, whereas the other approaches indicated that summer air temperatures were the best predictors of bass occurrence. Logistic regression and classification tree exhibited very low sensitivity, but very high specificity as a result of the large proportion of absences within the data set. Business-as-usual climate change scenarios suggest that smallmouth bass are expected to have suitable thermal habitat throughout most of Canada and the continental United States by 2100.					; Jackson, Donald/J-6441-2013	Sharma, Sapna/0000-0003-4571-2768; Jackson, Donald A/0000-0002-6107-0753													0706-652X	1205-7533				MAR	2008	65	3					471	481		10.1139/F07-178	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F07-178													WOS:000253775000013

Unexpected diversity found within benthic microbial mats at hydrothermal springs in Crater Lake, Oregon	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Crater Lake, Oregon is an oligotrophic freshwater caldera lake fed by thermally and chemically enriched hydrothermal springs. These vents distinguish Crater Lake from other freshwater systems and provide a unique ecosystem for study. This study examines the community structure of benthic microbial mats occurring with Crater Lake hydrothermal springs. Small subunit rRNA gene amplicon sequencing from eight bacterial mats was used to assess community structure. These revealed a relatively homogeneous, yet diverse bacterial community. High alpha diversity and low beta diversity indicate that these communities are likely fueled by homogeneous hydrothermal fluids. An examination of autotrophic taxa abundance indicates the potential importance of iron and sulfur inputs to the primary productivity of these mats. Chemoautotrophic potential within the mats was dominated by iron oxidation from Gallionella and Mariprofundus and by sulfur oxidation from Sulfuricurvum and Thiobacillus with an additional contribution of nitrite oxidation from Nitrospira. Metagenomic analysis showed that cbbM genes were identified as Gallionella and that aclB genes were identified as Nitrospira, further supporting these taxa as autotrophic drivers of the community. The detection of several taxa containing arsC and nirK genes suggests that arsenic detoxification and denitrification processes are likely co-occurring in addition to at least two modes of carbon fixation. These data link the importance of the detected autotrophic metabolisms driven by fluids derived from benthic hydrothermal springs to Crater Lake's entire lentic ecosystem.					; Fullerton, Heather/KCL-5493-2024	Fullerton, Heather/0000-0001-8747-5903; 														1664-302X				SEP 14	2022	13								876044	10.3389/fmicb.2022.876044	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.876044								36187998					WOS:000861686000001

In this study, we use a closed lake with well-dated lake beach ridges located on the margin of the East Asian summer monsoon, a region highly sensitive to monsoon precipitation changes, to obtain a temporal sequence of water volume in North China. The elevation of each beach ridge calibrated to the modern lake level was surveyed. Optically stimulated luminescence dating of undisturbed sediments of beach ridges was performed. The lake area and water volume corresponding to each beach ridge were calculated using a digital elevation model. This study reveals relatively reduced monsoon precipitation from ~12 to 7 ka interrupted by strengthening of the monsoon circulation to a maximum from ~7 to ~5 ka and followed by greatly reduced monsoon intensity until the present day. These results demonstrate that changes in the East Asian summer monsoon precipitation may not be directly driven by global temperature or atmospheric CO(2)content. Rather, we suggest that variation in the the monsoon margin precipitation is probably mainly driven by ice volume and subordinately by the summer solar insolation difference between mid-latitude land and low-latitude ocean.					; Cheng, Jun/G-4625-2013; Yang, Qianqian/HDO-2851-2022; Li, Xusheng/ITT-5389-2023; Xu, Zhiwei/D-1775-2016	Cheng, Jun/0000-0003-0168-1410; Wang, Yong/0000-0002-2878-966X; Han, Zhiyong/0000-0002-4133-5312; Li, Xusheng/0000-0002-1261-3619; 													0267-8179	1099-1417				JUL	2020	35	5					716	725		10.1002/jqs.3195	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jqs.3195													WOS:000541262300009

An analysis of traffic data from the Salt Lake City metropolitan area, Utah, USA	TRANSPORT POLICY												Air quality alert programs are a form of "soft" or persuasion-based policy that is common in metropolitan areas that do not meet federal air quality standards in the United States. These programs disseminate daily air quality conditions, with ordinal ratings describing the health implications and suggesting reductions in automobile use and other actions that contribute to the poor air quality. Evidence regarding the effectiveness of air quality alert programs on driving is less encouraging than other soft policies to discourage driving, with many studies reporting small or no reductions in traffic. This study examines evidence for the effectiveness of air quality alert systems in reducing traffic over a 10-year period in Salt Lake and Davis counties, Utah, USA, a metropolitan area that often does not meet US federal air quality standards for both ground-level ozone in the summer and PM 2.5 pollution in the winter. We find that while air quality alerts have some effectiveness for reducing traffic in the center city, these small reductions are exceeded by larger increases in traffic near the edge of the metropolitan area. These effects are stronger during the PM 2.5 alert season than during the ozone alert season. These increases can be explained as discretionary trips by individuals escaping poor air quality by driving to the mountains. A policy implication is that soft policies alone may not be effective at reducing driving behavior when the public health implication of the message conflicts with its public responsibility implication.

However, it is unclear how waterfowl coexist in agricultural landscapes by resource partitioning. We evaluated the diets of seven sympatric dabbling ducks foraging in rice paddy and lotus fields around Lake Kasumigaura, the second largest lake in Japan, during two wintering seasons (from November to February) by faecal DNA metabarcoding using chloroplast trnL and mitochondrial CO1 region sequences. We examined 420 faecal samples and found different patterns of dietary diversity and composition among the duck species. The pattern also differed between plant and invertebrate food. Dietary niche partitioning was clear in plant food. Large-bodied ducks intensively use crop plants, and other ducks might mediate competition by using terrestrial and aquatic plants that are suitable for their foraging behaviours or microhabitats. Dietary segregation among species was the most apparent in February, when the abundance of foraging ducks was the largest. This study illustrated the complex pattern of dietary niche partitioning of dabbling ducks in agricultural landscapes, which might be difficult to evaluate by conventional approaches. The availability of crop plants, as well as other plant food resources in flooted areas and farmland dikes, may enable ducks to coexist by spatial or behavioural resource partitioning.					; Isagi, Yuji/ABA-8678-2020	Inoue, Tomomi/0000-0002-2276-4402; 													0962-1083	1365-294X				DEC	2023	32	23			SI		6405	6417		10.1111/mec.16584	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.16584		JUL 2022						35762852					WOS:000822584300001
J	Aku, PMK; Tonn, WM				Aku, PMK; Tonn, WM			Effects of hypolimnetic oxygenation on the food resources and feeding ecology of cisco in Amisk Lake, Alberta	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Although the ability of hypolimnetic oxygenation to enhance coldwater fish populations depends, in part, on the availability of prey within the hypolimnion, studies that evaluate both fish diets and prey distributions during treatment are rare. This paper compares the diet of cisco Coregonus artedi, the dominant coldwater fish in Amisk Lake, Alberta, Canada, with the composition and vertical distribution of prey during the summers of 1989 and 1992 when one basin of this two-basin eutrophic lake was oxygenated; the second basin served as a reference. During periods of thermal stratification, ciscoes in the reference basin were restricted by hypoxia to epilimnetic and metalimnetic waters whereas those in the treated basin distributed into the hypolimnion, where dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations remained above 1.0 mg/L. Higher DO concentrations enabled ciscoes in the treated basin to feed throughout the water column and incorporate hypolimnetic and benthic prey species into their diets, whereas ciscoes in the reference basin ate primarily epilimnetic prey species. As a result, similarity in the composition of fish diet, which was high in early summer and during fall turnover, decreased through midsummer when differences in hypolimnetic DO concentrations between the two basins were most severe. Although foraging habitat for fish increased during oxygenation, whole-lake fish biomass also increased and resulted in a substantial reduction in per capita food levels; the amount of food in fish stomachs in 1989 was at least 30 times as high as in 1992. These results demonstrate that oxygenation can enhance availability of fish forage organisms in deep water. However, expanded foraging habitat may not always translate into increased food consumption if fish densities increase. Thus, the enhancement of coldwater fish populations during oxygenation will also depend on the nature of density-dependent interactions between fish and their prey.

Two days in the winter of 1980, when persistent heavy orographic rainfall occurred, have been considered. The rain gauge data indicated that rainfall near the hill summits was enhanced by a factor of between 3.2 and 7.6. It was found that the model was capable of predicting accurately the areas of maximum rainfall but tended to underpredict the magnitude of the orographic rainfall enhancement. This was attributed to orographic effects on the seeding rainfall rates. Over certain topography three-dimensional airflow effects were thought to play an important role in determining the locations of the rainfall maxima. Using typical values for sulphate aerosol loading and the concentration of sulphate in seeding rain, the model predicted a greater deposition of sulphate over the hills accompanying the rainfall enhancement. Sulphate deposition was enhanced by a factor of approximately 4 relative to the coastal rates.

J	Noll, MR				Noll, Mark R.			Phosphorus cycling in a managed lake ecosystem: Seasonal and longer-term trends	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Irondequoit Bay, adjacent to Rochester, NewYork, is one of the larger embayments along the southern coast of Lake Ontario. Since the 1980s, management activities have been focused on improving water quality and the trophic status of the bay, including a program of hypolimnetic oxygenation. During the summers of 2003, 2004 and 2009, a program of basic water quality parameter profiles and sediment sampling completed. Results of these surveys show an increase in hypolimnetic P throughout each summer season. The increase in P is concordant with decreasing dissolved O-2 concentrations. Although the dissolved O-2 levels are persistent in the suboxic range for most of the summer season, the oxygenation program prevents anoxic conditions, limiting the release of P to that associated with Mn oxyhydroxides. Longer-term trends show an upward linear trend in metalimnetic P which is associated with the trophic status of the bay. This upward trend may be linked to cycling and enrichment of the near surface sediment in P. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This study assesses the technical feasibility of agrivoltaic (APV), while it gives insights on how to design an APV system. Furthermore, it analyses the electrical yield and the behavior and productivity of four crops grown in Germany's largest agrivoltaic research facility installed in 2016 near Lake Constance within the research project APV-RESOLA by Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE. The German design differs from most other agrivoltaic approaches by allowing for a wide range of machine employment, facilitated by a vertical clearance of 5 m and a width clearance of up to 19 m. Crops cultivated under the APV system and on the reference field under a crop rotation scheme include potato, celeriac, clover grass and winter wheat. The land use efficiency measured by the Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) indicated a rise between 56% and 70% in 2017 while the dry and hot summer in 2018 demonstrated that the agrivoltaic system could increase land productivity by nearly 90%. Radiation simulations showed that deviating from full south by around 30 degrees resulted in equal distribution of radiation on ground level, representing the basis for the agrivoltaic design. Considering climate change and increasing land scarcity, our overall results suggest a high potential of agrivoltaics as a viable and efficient technology to address major challenges of the 21rst century.

Growth rates in these years were similar in early summer when young yellow perch were 20-50 mm total length and fed almost exclusively on Daphnia pulex but varied widely in late summer when the diet was more diverse. In early summer, food intake averaged 23% of body energy content, young yellow perch assimilated about 68% of the daily ration, and gross efficiency averaged 27%. Comparison of observed growth and energy available for growth calculated from an energy budget indicated estimates of food intake and respiration were reasonable. In years when the D. pulex population collapsed in late summer, young yellow perch shifted to alternate prey and growth declined. Variation in 1st-yr growth, mediated by D. pulex abundance, may determine the contribution of yellow perch cohorts to the adult stock.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1981	110	4					479	488		10.1577/1548-8659(1981)110<479:EFCAGO>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1981)110<479:EFCAGO>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1981MB85100002

Here we present for the first time a high-resolution composite proxy record for the Indian Ocean summer monsoon spanning around 12000 years based on the VC time series of both a single plant species (Carex mulieensis) remains cellulose and the total plant assemblage cellulose in the Hongyuan peat bog from the Tibet Plateau. The records show that the strength of the Indian Ocean summer monsoon had abrupt variations during the last 12000 years. The weakest monsoon occurred in the Younger Dryas period. Following rapid strengthening from around 11200 to 10 800 a BP the monsoon kept a generally strong level for around 5300 years. From around 5500 a BP onwards the monsoon strength tended to gradual decrease. In addition, there are a series of abrupt variation events of the monsoon strength on centennial to millennial time scales, which superimpose the general tendency of the monsoon variation. In every case when the ice-rafted debris events in the North Atlantic occurred, the summer monsoon strength decreased correspondingly. These evidences show that teleconnection between the Indian Ocean summer monsoon and the North Atlantic climate is present not only in the last glacial but also in the Holocene, which may be linked to abrupt reorganizations of the ocean thermohaline circulation, leading to redistribution of energy, changing temperature and moisture gradient over the southern subtropical Indian Ocean, and eventually controlling the variability of the Indian Ocean summer monsoon.

J	Murakami, A; Komatsu, Y; Takizawa, K				Murakami, Aoi; Komatsu, Yu; Takizawa, Kenji			Remote Detection of Red Edge Spectral Characteristics in Floating Aquatic Vegetation	ASTROBIOLOGY												The vegetation red edge of terrestrial plants is a key biosignature for the detection of life on Earth-like habitable exoplanets. Although water is essential for plants, an excess of water can limit the distribution of terrestrial vegetation. On planets with extensive water coverage and limited land, floating vegetation on the water's surface could serve as a crucial indicator of life. This study examined the spectral reflectance of floating plants across various scales, from individual leaves to lake-wide vegetation coverage. Our comparisons between individual leaves revealed that the red edge of floating plants was equivalent to or even more pronounced than that of terrestrial plants. Although water can reduce plant reflectance, the naturally low reflectance of water enhances the detection sensitivity for floating vegetation. Our observations of seasonal changes, such as the proliferation of floating plants in summer and their decline in winter, revealed significant variations in lake reflectance. By analyzing satellite images of lakes and marshes over a 5-year period, we confirmed that these seasonal variations in reflectance reliably indicated the presence of floating vegetation. The seasonal signal showed robustness to the effects of clouds, which pose another challenge on water-rich planets. We propose that floating vegetation be considered alongside, or even in place of, terrestrial vegetation in the search for extraterrestrial life.					; Komatsu, Yu/ONJ-5176-2025	MURAKAMI, Aoi/0000-0001-9225-7230; Takizawa, Kenji/0000-0002-1060-5738													1531-1074	1557-8070				MAR 1	2025	25	3					209	224		10.1089/ast.2024.0127	http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/ast.2024.0127		FEB 2025						39989105					WOS:001431529600001

We conclude that the loess-like sediment is of aeolian origin, as is the loess of the Chinese Loess Plateau. The geochemical characteristics of the loess-like sediment are similar to those of dammed lake and fluvial sediments in the same area, which is significantly different from those of the typical loess in NW China. The geochemical characteristics show that the loess-like sediment originated from proximal materials. Combined with the grain-size distribution pattern of the aeolian deposits, we suggest that the loess-like sediment of the Jinsha River Valley originated from the dammed lake and fluvial sediments that accumulated in the valley. The local mountain-valley wind circulation (especially the valley wind in winter and spring) provided the transport force for the loess-like sediment. The presentation of the loess-like sediment may indicate the appearance of the grassland and forest steppe and the beginning of the dry-hot valley phenomenon.

However, how soil moisture-atmosphere interaction can affect future climate change over East Asia remains largely unclear. We use long-term regional climate simulations with the Community Climate System Model-Weather Research and Forecasting (CCSM-WRF) model system to investigate the role of soil moisture feedbacks in future summer surface air temperature change over East Asia. Results show that summer surface air temperature and precipitation are projected to increase over most of East Asia by the end of 21st century under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario. Soil moisture feedbacks lead to an increased summer mean temperature of 0.15 degrees C averaged over East Asia, with key regions appearing over the northern part of Tibetan Plateau, Sichuan Basin, and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin during 2071-2100 under the RCP8.5 scenario. And regionally averaged interannual temperature variability induced by soil moisture feedbacks is substantially enhanced as a whole. Regarding the spatial distribution, soil moisture feedbacks on interannual temperature variability are projected to strengthen notably over the northern part of Tibetan Plateau, the Hexi Corridor, and Sichuan Basin and weaken over the south Tibetan Plateau, southeast China, and the areas surrounding the Lake Baikal. The stronger responses of surface heat and the atmospheric boundary layer to dry anomalies than wet anomalies lead to an obvious dry-wet asymmetry of soil moisture feedbacks on summer surface air temperature over the key areas of East Asia.					; Zhang, Jingyong/AAJ-1045-2020; Yang, Kai/HOA-7144-2023	Wu, Lingyun/0000-0002-2237-0374; Li, Kai/0000-0002-9116-3707; Zhang, Jingyong/0000-0003-1056-8436; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				NOV 27	2019	124	22					12034	12056		10.1029/2018JD029670	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JD029670		NOV 2019											WOS:000499198800001
J	Zheng, M; Zhou, LZ; Zhao, NN; Xu, WB				Zheng, Meng; Zhou, Lizhi; Zhao, Niannian; Xu, Wenbin			Effects of variation in food resources on foraging habitat use by wintering Hooded Cranes (Grus monacha)	AVIAN RESEARCH												Background: The ideal habitat use of waterbirds can be considered to be fixed, but current habitat use depends on environmental conditions, especially those of food characteristics, considered crucial to their use of habitats. Understanding how waterbirds respond to variation in food availability at degraded wetland sites and change their habitat use patterns over spatial and temporal scales should direct future conservation planning. The objectives of this study were to identify these spatial-temporal foraging habitat use patterns of Hooded Cranes (Grus monacha) and their relationship with food characteristics in the severely degraded wetlands of the Shengjin and Caizi lakes along with the Yangtze River floodplain. Methods: We investigated the changes in food characteristics, relative abundance and density of Hooded Cranes in various habitat types across three winter periods from November 2012 to April 2013. We examined the effect of these winter periods and habitat types on the pattern of use by the cranes and explored the relationship between these patterns and food characteristics using linear regression. Results: The food characteristics and habitat use clearly changed over spatial-temporal scales. In the early and mid-winter periods, the most abundant, accessible and frequented food resources were found in paddy fields, while in the late period the more abundant food were available in meadows, which then replaced the paddy fields. There were fewer effects of winter periods, habitat types and their interactions on habitat use patterns except for the effect of habitat types on the relative abundance, determined as a function of food abundance, but independent of food depth and sediment permeability. Conclusions: In response to the degradation and loss of lake wetlands, the cranes shifted their habitat use patterns by making tradeoffs between food abundance and accessibility over spatial-temporal scales that facilitated their survival in the mosaic of these lake wetlands.

J	Sonntag, N; Garthe, S; Adler, S				Sonntag, Nicole; Garthe, Stefan; Adler, Sven			A freshwater species wintering in a brackish environment: Habitat selection and diet of Slavonian grebes in the southern Baltic Sea	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												After the breeding season, Slavonian grebes (Podiceps auritus) leave their freshwater breeding habitats and migrate to wintering grounds in marine or brackish waters. The most important wintering area in northwestern Europe is located in the southern Baltic Sea, with the largest concentrations in the offshore area of the Pommeranian Bight. Analysis of ship-based surveys revealed that the habitat selection of Slavonian grebes in this brackish area is significantly influenced by water depth and bottom sediment type. The grebes prefer shallow waters of 4-14 m depth and occur only over sandy sediments. While the diving depths of endothermic animals is limited due to energetic constraints and thermoregulation, sediment type is regarded to be a proxy for food choice. The diet of Slavonian grebes in the Pomeranian Bight consists mainly of demersal gobies (Gobiidae) that frequently occur over sandy bottom substrates. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Be-10 and Al-26 model exposure ages (n = 68) delimit fan ages and suggest that deposition stopped after ca, 136, 15, 13, and 8 ka. One fan remains active and has undergone deposition throughout the Holocene. Soil development on three fans, where boulders were sampled for Be-10 and Al-26 analysis, also indicates distinct ages. Together, soil development and cosmogenic isotope data suggest that fan deposits correlate with the Tahoe and late Tioga glaciations. Soil profile development index values from Fish Springs are low compared with those determined elsewhere, suggesting relatively slow rates of soil formation for fan surfaces at Fish Springs and/or modification of soil profiles by surface processes during or following soil formation. Age estimates and measured offsets of the Fans are consistent with a long-term vertical slip rate of 0.24 +/- 0.04 m k.y.(-l) for the Fish Springs fault over the past 300 k.y.

J	Spaak, P				Spaak, P			Temporal changes in the genetic structure of the Daphnia species complex in Tjeukemeer, with evidence for backcrossing	HEREDITY												Temporal genetic variation was studied within the cyclic parthenogenetic Daphnia galeata-cucullata species complex in Lake Tjeukemeer (The Netherlands). During three successive years, three allozyme loci were studied in order to compare: the level of genetic variation in D. galeata (G), D. cucullata (C) and their interspecific hybrid (C x G). This data set was used to investigate: whether Cx G hybrids are regularly produced by the parental species and to what extent backcrossing takes place in this species complex. G and C x G were the most abundant taxa, whereas C was only abundant in late summer and autumn. Genetic diversity was highest in C, lowest in G, and intermediate in C x G. Pgm and Pgi allele frequencies of C x G were not intermediate to those of the parental species but were more similar to G than to C. In addition, almost no significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg were observed. An UPGMA analysis of Nei's genetic distances showed that C x G hybrids are more closely related to G (difference <0.04), than to C (difference 0.30). My data suggest, in accordance with other studies, that C x G hybrids are probably still formed by the parental species, though not necessarily every year. Furthermore, my data suggest that backcrossing occurred frequently, and led to introgression of C alleles into G.																			0018-067X					MAY	1996	76		5				539	548		10.1038/hdy.1996.77	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/hdy.1996.77													WOS:A1996UL23600013

In the deep karst lake, Grand Laoucien (Marseille area, France), this species had an unusually high population density (from 1000 ind./ m(3) in zooplankton to 4000 ind./ m(3) in the nearshore area) during the free-living period of its life cycle. The annual cycle of N. japonicus includes a 5-month overwintering of fertilized females attached to fish fins and, following this, a five- to six-generation chain from March to November, when the free-living stages in the population alternate with parasite females which attach to their hosts for breeding. The population density of the parasites in zooplankton increased exponentially from spring to autumn, which positively correlated with temperature. We found a strong correlation between N. japonicus density and the community development of microphytobenthos, but not between N. japonicus and phyto- or zooplankton dynamics. The local contributing factors included a seasonal three-fold decrease in water levels and the development of anoxia in profundal waters, which led to a high ambient fish density and thus susceptibility to the parasite. Although the free-living parasite represented only 1% of zooplankton production, it consumed up to 25% of small invertebrate productivity. The maximum intensity of infection reached 140 parasites per fish, or 4.14 per g of weight. The high infection of fish with this parasite, in our opinion, indicated the danger it poses to the local ichthyofauna, which first encountered this new parasite.</p>					alekseev, victor/C-7086-2014; Jamet, Jean-Louis/G-9893-2013; JAMET, Dominique/AAT-9861-2021; JAMET, Jean-Louis/G-9893-2013	Alekseev, Victor/0000-0002-1968-2609; CHAPPAZ, Remi/0000-0003-3414-7273; JAMET, Dominique/0000-0003-2575-3722; JAMET, Jean-Louis/0000-0002-2296-6231														2075-1729				OCT	2021	11	10							1100	10.3390/life11101100	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/life11101100								34685471					WOS:000715436700001

Winter wheat grain yield and grain nitrogen as influenced by bed and conventional planting systems	JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION												Bed planted wheat systems offer a new alternative for the traditional wheat producer to provide opportunities for crop rotation, more efficient use of water, and new techniques of nutrient management. This study was conducted to determine if planting winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in Oklahoma on raised beds can maintain grain yields while providing more options in the cropping system. Experiments were conducted at Hennessey and Lake Carl Blackwell, Oklahoma in 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 cropping seasons. The experiments consisted of a factorial combination of two planting systems (bed and conventional), four winter wheat varieties ('Custer', Jaggar', 'Intrada' and '2174'), and three nitrogen (N) rates (0, 67, and 134 kg ha(-1)). The experimental design was a randomized complete block with three replications. Grain yield was not statistically different between the bed and conventional planting systems for three of four site years. However, there was a trend for the conventional wheat production system to have an advantage in grain yield over the bed planting system due to difference in row configuration. For the bed system to be useful in Oklahoma, the current conventional tillage practice must be changed to reduced tillage to make use of bed plating system for conserving moisture. Also suitable planting configuration that minimizes intra-specific competition due to over-population must be addressed. Grain yield response to N rate was greater in the conventionally planted wheat versus the bed planted system.

J	Li, JH; Takii, S; Kotakemori, R; Hayashi, H				Li, JH; Takii, S; Kotakemori, R; Hayashi, H			Sulfate reduction in profundal sediments in Lake Kizaki, Japan	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The sulfate reduction rate was measured for almost four years in the profundal sediments of Lake Kizaki, a mesotrophic lake in central Japan. The rate was generally highest in the surface layer and decreased with depth. Seasonally, sulfate reduction tended to be high in spring and summer, and then to decrease until the end of stratification (December) in spite of a constant in situ temperature of around 6 degrees C, although fluctuations were found in every year. The rate also fluctuated greatly according to year. The maximum rate of sulfate reduction was 0.33 mmol m(-2) d(-1) in May, 1990, and the minimum was 0.004 mmol m(-2) d(-1) in March, 1993. These relatively low rates, compared with those reported for freshwater sediments, seem to be due to low concentrations of sulfate in the sediments (5-23 mu mol l(-1) in the surface layer). The rate was highly correlated with the concentration of sulfate in the sediments. The addition of sulfate stimulated sulfate reduction in all sediment samples tested, but adding lactate did not. Therefore, sulfate reduction should be limited mainly by the supply of sulfate. Measurements of sulfate reduction rates at different concentrations of added sulfate revealed a low concentration of half-saturation constant as low as 12 mu mol 1(-1).																			0018-8158					OCT 11	1996	333	3					201	208		10.1007/BF00013434	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00013434													WOS:A1996VR84200007

Gangadhara			Spatio-temporal distribution of aerosol optical depth and cloud properties over Lake Tana Basin, Upper Blue Nile River Basin, Ethiopia	REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT												The spatio temporal variations (with respect to space and time) of some of atmospheric parameters over Lake Tana Basin, Ethiopia have been studied from 2001 to 2019 to understand their relationships among aerosol optical depth AOD) and rainfall. The origin and movement of air masses which bring aerosol particles have been studied by using the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) values were found to be maximum during the summer season (June-August), but minimum during the winter season (December-February). The annual average of AOD over the Lake Tana Basin varies from 0.21 to 0.34 during 2001-2019 while monthly and seasonal AOD values vary between 0.05 and 0.32, and 0.07 and 0.25 respectively. The HYSPLIT air mass back trajectories model indicate that air masses were traced from Eritrean Plateau, Red sea, Arabian Peninsula, Gulf of Aden and Afar depression. The negative relationship between AOD and Angstrom exponent indicates that the fine mode aerosol particles are dominate over the Tana Lake Basin. The stronger positive correlation coefficient between AOD and cloud fraction (CF) over the Gonder region (north of the Lake Tana Basin) as compared to that for Dangila region (south-west of the Lake Tana Basin; r = 0.61 and r = 0.58 respectively), indicates the source of moisture from the Red Sea region. Nevertheless, the south-easterly increase in the spatial correlation between AOD and water vapor (WV) over the Lake Tana Basin suggests the prime source of moisture form the Western Indian Ocean. Thus, satellite derived AOD data are useful for the study of rainfall patterns.					; Manjunatha, Busnur/NWH-6113-2025	Tikuye (Ph.D), Birhan Getachew/0000-0002-5229-1845; 													2352-9385					NOV	2020	20								100401	10.1016/j.rsase.2020.100401	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2020.100401													WOS:000654346100017
J	FREEMAN, RS				FREEMAN, RS			ON BIOLOGY OF PROTEOCEPHALUS PARALLACTICUS MACLULICH ( CESTODA ) IN ALGONQUIN PARK CANADA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY - BACK YEAR PROJECT												Proteocephalus parallacticus MacLulich is common throughout the year in lake trout (Salveltnus namaycush). Beginning in late May or early June and continuing to early autumn, gravid worms occur throughout the summer in approximately 25% of the trout 3 to 4 years old or older. Plerocercoids may develop within 30 to 40 days at 16 C in Cyclops bicuspidatus, Cvernalls, and probably C. scutifer, but not in several other copepods which were tested; female C. bicuspidatus are most suitable. Normal growth is rare in copepods at 20[degree] C, and probably little growth occurs below 10[degree] C. In the gut of the trout plerocercoid I, the plerocercoid from the copepod, requires at least 30 to 40 days at optimal 12[degree] C to grow to plerocercoid II, which is morphologically identical to but approximately 10 times larger than plerocercoid I; in another 35 days or less plerocercoid II segments and grows to a gravid adult. The maximum temperature for growth is approximately 14[degree] C, and growth is slow below 10[degree] C. Trout may be in-fected directly with plerocercoid I from the copepod, or with plero-cercoids varying from I to II taken from the gut of other fish. Thus the plerocercoid of P. parallacticus has two phases of growth, one in the copepod and the other in the fish. The latter occurs within the gut rather than parenterally as with Pambloplltls.																									1964	42	3					387	+		10.1139/z64-035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z64-035													WOS:A19648170A00004
J	Pothoven, SA				Pothoven, Steven A.			Seasonal feeding ecology of co-existing native and invasive benthic fish along a nearshore to offshore gradient in Lake Michigan	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Relative abundance, diet composition and feeding strategy were determined for three benthic fish, the native deepwater sculpin Myoxocephalus thompsonii (Girard, 1851) and slimy sculpin Cottus cognatus (Richardson, 1836), and the invasive round goby Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas, 1814), along a nearshore to offshore gradient in southeastern Lake Michigan during March-December 2010, 2015, and 2016. Round goby were most abundant in the nearshore (< 25 m), slimy sculpin were most abundant in the transitional zone (35-65 m), and deepwater sculpin were most abundant in the offshore zone (> 75 m). Despite a large degree of spatial separation, some species did overlap, with slimy and deepwater sculpin occurring in sympatry throughout the year in the offshore and transitional zones, and round goby overlapping with both sculpin species seasonally in the transitional zone. Deepwater sculpin exhibited specialization on Mysis diluviana in all depth regions. Slimy sculpin in the offshore reduced diet overlap with deepwater sculpin by specializing on fish eggs during spring and fall, whereas in the transitional depth zone, there was considerable overlap between sculpin species due to the high importance of Mysis in diets. The invasive round goby had a mixed diet, with some diet overlap with native sculpin, especially slimy sculpin, in the transitional zone. In the nearshore zone, round goby displayed a generalized diet with many prey contributing to the diet, but the average contribution of any prey was generally low. Spatial separation and variable feeding strategies help reduce, but not eliminate shared resource use amongst these benthic fish in Lake Michigan.

Douglas			Factors regulating primary production and phytoplankton dynamics in western Lake Erie	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Phosphorus management plans in the Great Lakes were based on an empirical relationship between total phosphorus loads and primary production. The aim of this study was to determine if primary production in western Lake Erie had declined as predicted by these original models. Annual primary production, estimated using both in situ and constant light incubations, ranged from 320-370 g C m(-2) between 2000 and 2002. The current rate of annual primary production in the west basin was comparable with the 340 g C m(-2) reported for 1970 when phosphor-us abatement programs were initiated. Phytoplankton standing crop, measured as chlorophyll-a, has declined however, from annual mean (i.e. growing season) concentrations of 12 mg m(-3) in 1970 to 4-7 mg m(-3) in 2000-2002. Phytoplankton biomass ranged from 4-5 g m(-3) in the spring and summer of 2000-2001, similar to the 5-7 g m(-3) reported in 1970. Taxonomic analysis of the phytoplankton community, however, revealed an increase in the relative abundance of mesotrophic genera (e.g. Chlamydomonas, Cyclotella, Microcystis) as compared with the more eutrophic assemblage observed in 1970. It is concluded that primary production in the western basin of Lake Erie has not declined as predicted by the original phosphorus-chlorophyll-a-primary production models. Multiple stressor models linking nutrient dynamics to species invasions and subsequent changes in the underwater light climate are required for the future management of primary production in Lake Erie.

The salt-affected communities of Cheyenne Bottoms, located in central Kansas, are a crucial stopover site for migratory waterfowl and shorebirds. In 1998, The Nature Conservancy attempted to restore native plant communities to grazed and former cropland at Cheyenne Bottoms by reestablishing sheet flow across these disturbed areas. We collected vegetation cover data along permanent transects established in rangeland, former cropland, and in a shallow basin 3 years (1996-1998) before the hydrological changes and continued to collect vegetation data for 3 years (1999-2001) after the hydrological changes. Vegetation composition changes in response to the restored hydrology were subtle, but the average wetland index along the transects in the basin and the rangeland significantly declined. Significant decreases occurred in the cover of perennials and graminoids in both spring and fall species assemblages of the rangeland area. Changes in the former cropped areas were mixed, indicating the difficulty of restoring these disturbed plant communities to native plant assemblages within a few years.																			1061-2971	1526-100X				SEP	2004	12	3					368	375		10.1111/j.1061-2971.2004.00293.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1061-2971.2004.00293.x													WOS:000223534700008

First documentation of spawning and nest guarding in the laboratory by the invasive fish, the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus)	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Although the round goby, Neogobius melanostomus, is widespread in the Great Lakes and has an extended breeding season with a high reproductive rate; its spawning behaviour remains elusive. We present the first reported accounts of spawning by the round goby in the laboratory. By simulating winter conditions and restoring spring conditions, we induced round gobies to spawn in October 2007, March 2008, May 2008, and January 2009. In one case, fanning by the nest-holding male began 10 days before egg deposition and, during this period, the male rubbed secretions along the ceiling of the nest. Males were choosy about which gravid females entered the nest and prevented entry by some females. Spawning involved repeated inversions by females and males releasing gametes on the ceiling of the nest. Males guarded the nest by blocking the entrance, producing agonistic vocalizations and chasing intruders. Inside the nest, eggs were regularly inspected by the males and constantly ventilated using pectoral and caudal fins. Up to three gravid females spawned sequentially in a nest. Peak ventilation occurred after egg deposition and declined with time until the parental male ate the eggs. The decline of parental care and egg cannibalism was likely an artifact of laboratory conditions and small brood size. Our findings offer new information on the reproductive habits of the invasive round goby. Because the reproductive sequence in the laboratory seems easy to disrupt, the procedures may lead to a management tool to control the spread of the species into new areas. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

To understand the environmental conditions that allow for persistent ice cover we established an automatic meteorological station on White Smoke Lake, a perennially ice-covered lake in contact with the Apfel Glacier. The data were collected from January 1992-July 1993. The mean annual solar flux during this period was 115 W m(-2), the mean wind speed 4.6 m s(-1), and the mean air temperature -11.2 degrees C. Summer degree-days above freezing (71 degrees C-days) are similar to regions of the Antarctic (the McMurdo Dry Valleys -78 degrees 45'S; 163 degrees 00'E) with thick perennial lake ice but the winter freezing degree days (3987 degrees C-Days) are much smaller and are closer to regions with seasonal ice covers (e.g. the high Arctic). The Bunger Hills Oasis seems to be in a marginal climatic region for the persistence of thick lake ice. Therefore, the extent of glacier ice contact becomes the controlling factor in maintaining an ice cover all year. We propose that this is either through the heat sink the glacier offers, and/or the positive feedback for ice growth provided by the high albedo of the adjacent glacier.					; Andersen, Dale/B-4816-2013; Meyer, Marion/E-3042-2010; Doran, Peter/ABS-7911-2022	McKay, Christopher/0000-0002-6243-1362; Andersen, Dale/0000-0001-8827-1259; 													0954-1020					SEP	1996	8	3					289	296		10.1017/S0954102096000429	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954102096000429													WOS:A1996VF01800012

The individual set of parameters of a conceptual hydrological model, HBV (Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning)-light, are first calibrated for these three subbasins. The calibrated model was validated and further used to estimate the future streamflow driven by statistically downscaled projected precipitation and air temperature from the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium under Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 and 4.5 scenarios. The uncertainty of annual streamflow, hydrograph, flow duration curve (FDC), and flood frequency were evaluated. The results reveal that the annual streamflows of the Beaver and Pefferlaw River Basins (PRB) are projected to slightly increase in 2020-2099 while the annual streamflows of the East Holland River Basin (EHRB) are expected to be similar in 2020-2099. The monthly streamflow in winter is projected to increase but to decrease in spring across three subbasins. Based on the projected FDCs, daily streamflow of EHRB and PRB will likely increase by 2070-2099. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

We applied the concept of new production to Mirror Lake, New Hampshire, and our view of P dynamics in this lake was altered dramatically. New production during midsummer put a large demand on P in surface waters, removing 37-mu-mol P m-2 d-1. Without new inputs of P, the P content of surface waters would drop to zero in < 1 month. There is, however, a slight increase, not a decrease, in P content of surface waters during summer stratification. Inputs to surface waters during summer months must, therefore, be large. We now believe that higher than average P loading to the lake occurs in summer, despite low runoff inputs.

We investigated how contrasting summer and autumn precipitation can shape annual and inter-annual variation in ecosystem carbon (C) flux (gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and CO2 efflux) in two subtropical lakes differing substantially in trophic state and water color. Instrumented buoys recorded time series of free-water DO, terrestrial DOM (tDOM), chlorophyll a, water temperature profiles, and meteorological measurements over five years (2009-2011 and 2014-2015). Reduced precipitation caused immediate and prolonged effects on C flux in both lakes. During the drought year (2014) GPP and ER declined by 60 to 80% and both lakes were either CO2 sinks or neutral. In the subsequent wet year (2015), GPP and ER increased by 40 to 110%, and both lakes shifted to strong net CO2 emitters. Higher ecosystem R resulted from larger GPP while higher tDOM contributed to a dramatic increase in dissolved inorganic carbon, which intensified CO2 emission in both lakes. C flux was more responsive in the clear mesotrophic lake, declining by approximately 40% in the cumulative GPP and ER, and increasing by >400% in CO2 efflux whereas changes in the oligotrophic colored lake were more modest (approximately 30% and 300% for metabolic declines and efflux increases, respectively). Temporal variation and magnitude of C flux were governed by tDOM-mediated changes in epilimnetic nutrient levels and hypolimnetic light availability. This study demonstrated terrestrial loads of DOM strongly influence the inter-annual response and sensitivity of ecosystem C flux to variation in inter-annual precipitation. Our findings have important implications for predicting the trend, magnitude, duration, and sensitivity of the response of C flux in subtropical lakes/reservoirs to future changes in precipitation patterns under altered climatic conditions.

Falling lake level (evaporation > freshwater inputs) during 5-yr led to unstable salinity (S) profiles (mixed-layer S > hypolimnetic S) over the period of strong thermal stratification (June-October). Profiles in October 1991 and 1994 indicate the occurrence of double diffusive salt fingering because of unstable salinity stratification. Stable salinity stratification persisted throughout the summer and delayed holomixis in 1993, the only year freshwater inputs were greater than evaporation. Biweekly to monthly eddy diffusivities (KZ) at the thermocline were estimated with the flux-gradient heat method corrected for solar heating. June-September KZ averages ranged from 9.5 x 10(-7) m(2)/s (SE = 4.8 x 10(-7)) during wet 1993 (0.4 m lake level rise) to 4.2 x 10(-6) m(2)/s (SE = 1.9 x 10(-6)) during the 1989 drought (0.6 m lake level decrease). The Lake Number, an index of seiche-induced mixing below the mixed-layer, explained 68 % of the variance in April-September metalimnetic diffusivities. Over the 6-yr 50-90 % of the seasonal (April-September) upward flux of ammonium was used or converted within the metalimnion likely from algal uptake and nitrification.

Data were collected during periods of phytoplankton seasonal maxima which determine the total level of their annual production. The development of phytoplankton was assessed by biomass expressed in units of wet weight for Lake Baikal and units of chlorophyll a for the Rybinsk Reservoir. To assess the sustainability of biomass, its coefficients of variation, deviation from the mean value, and population stability index were calculated. These metrics did not reveal any definite inter-annual trends in the state of phytoplankton, but showed sharp changes in the level of community resistance in years with different trophic state. In both water bodies, a decrease in stability was observed under conditions atypical for the ecosystem. In the oligotrophic Lake Baikal, the most unstable situation was noted in highly productive years with the mass development of diatoms in the spring plankton. In the moderately eutrophic Rybinsk Reservoir, its resistance decreased in low productivity years with a weak summer development of phytoplankton and cyanobacteria due to the unfavorable weather conditions. The proposed approach will be of interest for assessing the stability of other aquatic ecosystems.

CH4 emissions from reservoirs, characterized by ebullition and diffusion, primarily increase with temperature but are suppressed when reservoirs are frozen. However, these emissions are influenced not only by temperature but also by other conditions, making it difficult to understand with a single value of the CH4 emission factor provided by the IPCC. The CH4 emissions from the Yonghwasil Reservoir in South Korea were measured using the eddy covariance method to analyze their behavior under varying meteorological conditions. CH4 emissions were positively correlated with air temperature with negligible emissions observed at air temperatures below 8 degrees C. Therefore, CH4 emission rates during the summer season are significantly higher than those in winter. From August to October, more than 60% of CH4 was emitted as ebullition. In contrast, from November to January, total CH4 emissions decreased, with a resulting 80% from diffusion. Additionally, atmospheric pressure negatively influenced CH4 emission but was correlated with air temperature. Wind speed had no observable effect on CH4 emissions at low temperatures but contributed to increased emissions under high-temperature conditions.

Numerical Modeling of the Long-Term Transport, Dispersion, and Accumulation of Black Sea Pollutants into the North Aegean Coastal Waters	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												This study investigates the long-term capacity of the North Aegean coastal systems to transport and store conservative pollutants that originate from the Black Sea. Emphasis is placed on modeling the dispersion and accumulation of a passive tracer that represents a Black Sea pollutant (BSP) substance that continuously discharges from the Dardanelles exit into the North Aegean, for a long period of time (16 years). The effects of the Black Sea water (BSW) inflows, meteorological forcing, and seasonal stratification are assessed with a 3D hydrodynamic model (Estuary, Lake and Coastal Ocean Model), after validation with available field data. The salinity, water temperature, and discharge from the Dardanelles Strait are taken to be seasonally varied. According to the authors' best knowledge, the present paper constitutes the first numerical modeling attempt in the literature that apart from the long-term hydrodynamic characteristics that have also been studied in previous works, a suitable tracer is introduced in order to predict the long-term fate, distribution, and accumulation of pollutants that originate from the Black Sea into the North Aegean coastal regions. The overall results of the present investigation indicate that the BSP concentration is very high at the coastal waters of Thassos, Samothraki, and Limnos islands, as well as along the mainland coastal waters between Alexandroupolis and Strymonikos Gulf, during summer and autumn when strong water column stratification occurs. In general, the BSP concentration in the North Aegean surface waters reaches considerable high values (47-58 % of the initial pollutant concentration at Dardanelles inflow) within 16 years. Even for depths more than 500 m the BSP concentration is still remarkable, slightly increasing with time. The increase of the BSP concentration with respect to time at various depths (from free surface up to 750 m) is also investigated.					; Georgoulas, Anastasios/M-2821-2019	Georgoulas, Anastasios/0000-0002-8833-2178; 													1559-2723	1559-2731				NOV	2012	35	6					1530	1550		10.1007/s12237-012-9540-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-012-9540-9													WOS:000309660700013

As a typical arid region, the Badain Jaran Desert (BJD) is famous in the world for the presence of a large number of groundwater-fed saline lakes among the mega dunes. Based on the up to date geological surveys and observations, this study analyzed the groundwater contributions in water-salt balances of the lakes in the desert. We found different types of springs, including the sublacustrine springs that indicate an upward flow of groundwater under the lakebed. A simplified water balance model was developed to analyze the seasonal variations of water level in the SumuBarunJaran Lake, which revealed an approximately steady groundwater discharge in the lake and explained why the amplitude of seasonal changes in lake level is less than 0.5 m. In addition, a salt balance model was developed to evaluate the salt accumulations in the groundwater-fed lakes. The relative salt accumulation time is 800-7,000 years in typical saline lakes, which were estimated from the concentration of Cl-, indicating a long history evolution for the lakes in the BJD. Further researches are recommended to provide comprehensive investigations on the interactions between the lakes and groundwater in the BJD.

This project provides for the restoration of the biodiversity of the Aral Sea region. In 2012, the wetlands of the Syr Darya delta and the Northern Aral Sea were included in the international list of key ornithological sites protected by the Ramsar Convention. The avifauna of the Aral Sea and the delta of the Syr Darya River was thoroughly studied until the 90s of the 20th century. It would be erroneous to declare a complete scientific analysis of the fauna of birds without the results of winter counts. The article presents the results of bird counts of Lake Carta, during the winter seasons 2014-2017. As expected, the number of species present and their species is highly dependent on the established weather conditions. So, a relatively rich species diversity was recorded in 2015/2016, the quantitative composition is 7 species. The smallest number of representatives of the avifauna - 4 species, was observed in 2015, 2017. In the remaining accounting season of 2014, there is a relatively average number of 5 species. The main representatives of the winter period in the study area are species of the order of passerine, recorded in all accounting seasons. In addition, one species of the Falconiform, two species from the Charadriiform order were observed. The results of the study are important scientific data, since for a full-fledged analysis of bird fauna it is necessary to operate with observational data of all seasons of the reference year, including winter ones. The information is new for the study area.																			1390-9304						2017	4	13	2				PR83	PR91																WOS:000427518200007
J	SMITH, DW; PETERSON, RO				SMITH, DW; PETERSON, RO			BEHAVIOR OF BEAVER IN LAKES WITH VARYING WATER LEVELS IN NORTHERN MINNESOTA	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												We studied the effects of winter water drawdowns (2.3 m) on beavers in Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota, USA. Our study was designed to sample areas within the park that differed in water drawdown regime. Lodges were counted and beavers were livetrapped and radio-implanted to study behavior, movements, and mortality. Active beaver lodge density, determined by aerial survey in 1984 and 1986, was greatest along the shoreline of the drawdown reservoir. In winter beavers living on the drawdown reservoir spent less time inside their lodges than did beavers from stable water environments, foraged more above ice, and they were unable to fully use stored food. Only one case of starvation in the drawdown reservoir was documented, but beavers in reservoirs that were drawn down survived winter in poorer condition than did beavers living in areas in which water levels remained high. In spite of an increasing population and lack of widespread mortality, winter water drawdowns did alter beaver behavior. To reduce these impacts, total annual water fluctuation should not exceed 1.5 m, and winter drawdown should not exceed 0.7 m. Possible management alternatives and costs are discussed.																			0364-152X					MAY-JUN	1991	15	3					395	401		10.1007/BF02393886	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02393886													WOS:A1991FQ04100011
J	Garg, PK; Shukla, A; Jasrotia, AS				Garg, Purushottam Kumar; Shukla, Aparna; Jasrotia, Avtar Singh			On the strongly imbalanced state of glaciers in the Sikkim, eastern Himalaya, India	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This study evaluates multiple glacier parameters (length, area, debris cover, snowline altitude (SLA), glacial lakes, velocity, and surface elevation change) to comprehend the response of poorly understood glaciers of the Sikkim Himalaya to climate change. For the proposed task, 23 representative glaciers were selected from the region, and remotely acquired data from Landsat-TM/ETM/OLI (1991-2017), and Terra-ASTER (2007-2017) along with the SRTM DEMs were used for extraction of the various parameters. Results show that during 1991-2015 the studied glaciers have significantly retreated (17.78 +/- 2.06 m a(-1)), deglaciated (5.44 +/- 0.87%), and experienced a considerable increase in SLA (similar to 7 m a(-)1) and debris cover (16.49 +/- 2.96%). Glaciers slowed-down (by 24.90%) with sizable growth in number (23.81%) and area (48.78 +/- 2.23%) of glacial lakes. They also exhibit a notable downwasting (-0.77 +/- 0.08 m a(-1)) during 2000-2007/17. The behavior of glaciers in the region is heterogeneous and found to be primarily determined by glacier size, debris cover and glacial lakes. Though a generalized mass loss is observed for both small- (<3 km(2)) and large-sized glaciers (>10 km(2)), they seem to adopt different mechanisms to cope with the ongoing climatic changes. While the first adjust mostly by retreat/deglaciation, the latter lose mass through downwasting. Comparing with other Himalayan regions, the magnitude of dimensional changes and debris growth are higher in the Sikkim. The SLA trends are comparable with the central and western Himalaya up to 2000, but a reverse trend is seen afterwards. Also, contrary to the western and central Himalaya, where glaciers are reported to have slowed-down in recent decade, the Sikkim glaciers have shown negligible deceleration after 2000. Climate analysis confirm almost double increase in summer temperature (24.47%) than winters (12.77%) during 1990-2016, which, given the 'summer-accumulation-type' nature of the Sikkim glaciers, seems to be the prime driver of the observed changes.

J	Klein-BenDavid, O; Gvirtzman, H; Katz, A				Klein-BenDavid, O; Gvirtzman, H; Katz, A			Geochemical identification of fresh water sources in brackish groundwater mixtures; the example of Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee), Israel	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Fresh waters that dilute brines are considered to have a negligible effect on the ion ratios of the resultant mixture. We show that the major element composition of the fresh end-member can be deduced from the chemical composition of the mixed waters. That composition, then, can be used to differentiate between different neighboring carbonate aquifers, which supply the water. This is demonstrated for the Fuliya and Tabgha saline springs, located on the northwestern shore of Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee), Israel. At these springs, shallow fresh groundwater mixes with brines from deep aquifers. Seven saline springs and wells located at the Fuliya and Tabgha blocks were sampled over a year, and 32 eastern Galilee fresh springs and wells were sampled as representatives of the fresh water end-member. All samples were analyzed for major and minor ions. The saline spring data were used to construct mixing lines, followed by their extrapolation to low concentrations in order to derive the ion/ chloride ratio characterizing the fresh component. We constructed ion/Cl vs. Cl curves; projection of the composition of fresh water on the calculated curve was used to identify a certain fresh water source as a possible end-member. Results indicate that the composition of the water feeding the Fuliya springs is different from that at Tabgha, reflecting interactions with different rocks in each basin. The major fresh water end-member diluting the Fuliya brines is characterized by high Mg/Cl and low Sr/Cl ratios, and is consistent with the composition of fresh groundwater in the dolomitic Cenomanian and Turonian aquifers widely exposed in the Fuliya drainage basin. The major fresh water end-member diluting the Tabgha brines, on the other hand, is characterized by low Mg/Cl and high Sr/Cl ratios, and is consistent with the composition of fresh groundwater in the chalky Eocene Timrat Fin. and Senonian outcrops. Although the chalky formations in the Tabgha drainage basin are exposed over only 20% of the area they contribute most of the solutes to the fresh water end-member. Rain flows over the chalky formations and then infiltrates into the Bar-Kokhba Eocene outcrops. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The territory is characterised by a semi-arid climate with a dry and a wet semester occurring in the year. Evaporative losses are strong during the summer and, on an annual basis, they often exceed precipitation. Thus, reservoirs constitute an important water resource for the island to supply drinking water and to provide for agricultural needs in the periods of drought. However, despite their importance, they receive poor attention from the scientific and political communities and in the absence of any environmental policy or suitable territorial planning, their water quality is undergoing a rapid decline, principally due to the inadequate treatment of urban waste waters and to the excessive and irrational spreading of fertilizer. The convinction that reservoirs may differ significantly from lakes and the necessity to better understand what rules drive the functioning of these environments, were the engine to carry out several limnological investigations on these artificial environments with special reference to their pelagic compartment. The principal characteristics of these water bodies lie in their peculiar hydrological cycle. The absence of precipitations during summer, when the reservoirs are intensively used, and their re-filling in winter without any outflow contribute to water-level fluctuations which interfere with their thermal structure, underwater light climate and nutrient dynamics'. The structure of phytoplankton assemblages is, in the absence of a severe nutrient limitation, modulated by hydrological forcing. In addition to these "bottom-up" effects some "top-down" ones, also mediated by the water-level fluctuations. These involved the strength of predation pressure exherted by fish on zooplankton assemblage. Ultimately, it has been demonstrated that these water movements influence the structure of these ecosystems profoundly and their effects have to be carefully considered when management procedures have to be developed.

During the late autumn and winter season, cold air advection over relatively warm lakes can induce instability in the lower planetary boundary layer (PBL), facilitating the exchange of moisture and energy fluxes and fuelling the development of snowfall. Snowfall in this region can have disastrous impacts on local communities such as the November 2014 Buffalo storm that caused 13 fatalities. This paper discusses historical snowfall trends along the Canadian leewards shores of Lakes Superior and Huron-Georgian Bay and explores several lake-induced predictor variables that may influence the snowfall trends. Spatio-temporal snowfall and total precipitation trends were computed for the 1980-2015 period over the Great Lakes Basin (GLB) using the Daymet (version 3) gridded estimated data set. Results show a significant decrease in snowfall, at a rate of 40cm/36years, and a significant decrease in total precipitation of 20mm/36years, along the Ontario snowbelts of Lake Superior and partially along that of Lake Huron-Georgian Bay at the 95% confidence level during the cold season. Attributions to these negative spatio-temporal trends are explored using data from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) and the Canadian Ice Service (CIS) data sets. Predictor variables show significant warming in lake surface temperature (LST) at a rate of over 6K/36years for Lake Superior, significant decrease in ice cover fraction for both lakes, and an increase in the vertical temperature gradient (VTG) between the LST and the 850mb level. While the behavioural trends of these variables are believed to enhance snowfall through increased evaporation, there are other complex processes involved, such as inefficient moisture recycling and increased moisture storage in warmer air masses that may inhibit the development of snowfall along the immediate leewards shores of Lake Superior.					; Duguay, Claude/G-5682-2011	Duguay, Claude/0000-0002-1044-5850; 													0899-8418	1097-0088				AUG	2018	38	10					3942	3962		10.1002/joc.5546	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.5546													WOS:000440826000013

Late quaternary distal tephra-fall deposits in lacustrine sediments, Kenai Peninsula, Alaska	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Tephra-fall deposits from Cook Inlet volcanoes were detected in sediment cores from Tustumena and Paradox Lakes, Kenai Peninsula, Alaska, using magnetic susceptibility and petrography. The ages of tephra layers were estimated using 21 C-14 ages on macrofossils. Tephras layers are typically fine, gray ash, 1-5 mm thick, and composed of varying proportions of glass shards, pumice, and glass-coated phenocrysts. Of the two lakes, Paradox Lake contained a higher frequency of tephra (0.8 tephra/100 yr; 109 over the 13,200-yr record). The unusually large number of tephra. in this lake relative to others previously studied in the area is attributed to the lake's physiography, sedimentology, and limnology. The frequency of ash fall was not constant through the Holocene. In Paradox Lake, tephra layers are absent between ca. 800-2200, 3800-4800, and 9000-10,300 cal yr BP, despite continuously layered lacustrine sediment. In contrast, between 5000 and 9000 cal yr BP, an average of 1.7 tephra layers are present per 100 yr. The peak period of tephra fall (7000-9000 cal yr BP; 2.6 tephra/100 yr) in Paradox Lake is consistent with the increase in volcanism between 7000 and 9000 yr ago recorded in the Greenland ice cores.

Late Cenozoic climate changes in China's western interior: a review of research on Lake Qinghai and comparison with other records	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We review Late Cenozoic climate and environment changes in the western interior of China with an emphasis on lacustrine records from Lake Qinghai. Widespread deposition of red clay in the marginal basins of the Tibetan Plateau indicates that the Asian monsoon system was initially established by similar to 8 Ma, when the plateau reached a threshold altitude. Subsequent strengthening of the winter monsoon, along with the establishment of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, reflects a long-term trend of global cooling. The few cores from the Tibetan Plateau that reach back a million years suggest that they record the mid-Pleistocene transition from glacial cycles dominated by 41 ka cycles to those dominated by 100 ka cycles. During Terminations I and II, strengthening of the summer monsoon in China's interior was delayed compared with sea level and insolation records, and it did not reach the western Tibetan Plateau and the Tarim Basin. Lacustrine carbonate delta(18)O records reveal no climatic anomaly during MIS3, so that high terraces interpreted as evidence for extremely high lake levels during MIS3 remain an enigma. Following the Last Glacial Maximum (LSM), several lines of evidence from Lake Qinghai and elsewhere point to an initial warming of regional climate about 14 500 cal yr BP, which was followed by a brief cold reversal, possibly corresponding to the Younger Dryas event in the North Atlantic region. Maximum warming occurred about 10 000 cal yr BP, accompanied by increased monsoon precipitation in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Superimposed on this general pattern are small-amplitude, centennial-scale oscillations during the Holocene. Warmer than present climate conditions terminated about 4000 cal yr BP. Progressive lowering of the water level in Lake Qinghai during the last half century is mainly a result of negative precipitation-evaporation balance within the context of global warming.

J	Carrea, L; Merchant, C; Woolway, R; McCarroll, N				Carrea, Laura; Merchant, Christopher J.; Woolway, Richard I.; McCarroll, Niall			Factors influencing lake surface water temperature variability in West Greenland and the role of the ice sheet	CRYOSPHERE												Subarctic West Greenland is populated by thousands of seasonally ice-free lakes. Using remotely sensed observations, we analyse the surface water temperatures of six lakes during 1995-2022 to identify factors influencing their variability. The connectivity to the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) has a clear influence on lake surface temperature, with ice-sheet-marginal lakes experiencing smaller average summer maximum temperature (<6 degrees C) and minimal interannual variability. A lake fed by a GrIS-originating river has the fastest seasonal response and largest seasonal amplitude with average maximum temperatures above 13 degrees C. The seasonal cycle of surface water temperature for all studied lakes is asymmetrical, with faster warming observed after ice-off and a slower cooling of water towards winter freezing. We find that during the study period, the onset of positive stratification occurred earlier, at rates of up to 0.5 d yr(-1), and that July-August temperatures increased at rates up to 0.1 degrees C yr(-1), although the GrIS-connected lakes show smaller increases. Our analysis suggests that the main meteorological factor determining interannual variability of surface water temperature in the studied lakes is air temperature. This study highlights the important role of remote sensing for long-term monitoring of Greenland lakes under climate change.																			1994-0416	1994-0424				AUG 21	2025	19	8					3139	3158		10.5194/tc-19-3139-2025	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-19-3139-2025													WOS:001553855800001

This study was planned to improve the recording of the occurrence of diplozoids in V. vimba from a pristine area in a different geographical region. A total of 397 specimens of V. vimba were collected from Lake Koycegiz by commercial fishermen over a period of one year and examined for the presence of diplozoids. Only one species of Paradiplozoon was found. Following a detailed morphological examination, the species was identified as Paradiplozoon bliccae (Reichenbach-Klinke 1961), which was subsequently confirmed by molecular data. A total of 1025 specimens of P. bliccae infected 185 of the 397 Vimba vimba specimens examined, with prevalence, mean intensity and abundance of 46.6%, 5.5 +/- 4 parasites/fish, 2.5, respectively. The highest prevalence and mean abundance were determined in spring, while mean intensity values were higher in summers. Female hosts showed higher prevalence, mean intensity and mean abundance than males. This is the first report on the diplozoid P. bliccae from the locality and the first molecular characterization of P. bliccae from V. vimba in Lake K & ouml;yce & gbreve;iz. This study adds to the geographical range of the species.

A managed boreal landscape consists of various sinks and sources of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC) across forests, mires, lakes, and streams. Due to the spatial heterogeneity, large uncertainties exist regarding the net landscape carbon balance (NLCB). In this study, we compiled terrestrial and aquatic fluxes of CO2, CH4, DOC, DIC, and harvested C obtained from tall-tower eddy covariance measurements, stream monitoring, and remote sensing of biomass stocks for an entire boreal catchment (68 km(2)) in Sweden to estimate the NLCB across the land-water-atmosphere continuum. Our results showed that this managed boreal forest landscape was a net C sink (NLCB = 39 g C m(-2) year(-1)) with the landscape-atmosphere CO2 exchange being the dominant component, followed by the C export via harvest and streams. Accounting for the global warming potential of CH4, the landscape was a GHG sink of 237 g CO2-eq m(-2) year(-1), thus providing a climate-cooling effect. The CH4 flux contribution to the annual GHG budget increased from 0.6% during spring to 3.2% during winter. The aquatic C loss was most significant during spring contributing 8% to the annual NLCB. We further found that abiotic controls (e.g., air temperature and incoming radiation) regulated the temporal variability of the NLCB whereas land cover types (e.g., mire vs. forest) and management practices (e.g., clear-cutting) determined their spatial variability. Our study advocates the need for integrating terrestrial and aquatic fluxes at the landscape scale based on tall-tower eddy covariance measurements combined with biomass stock and stream monitoring to develop a holistic understanding of the NLCB of managed boreal forest landscapes and to better evaluate their potential for mitigating climate change.					; Kljun, Natascha/B-8467-2008; Chi, Jinshu/AAI-2059-2019; Frabsson, Johan/HKM-9613-2023; Peichl, Matthias/A-2087-2014; Laudon, Hjalmar/J-3074-2013; Lindroth, Anders/N-4697-2014	Wallerman, Jorgen/0000-0002-9996-1447; Chi, Jinshu/0000-0001-5688-8895; Kljun, Natascha/0000-0001-9650-2184; Nilsson, mats/0000-0003-3765-6399; Peichl, Matthias/0000-0002-9940-5846; Laudon, Hjalmar/0000-0001-6058-1466; Lindroth, Anders/0000-0002-7669-784X													1354-1013	1365-2486				APR	2020	26	4					2353	2367		10.1111/gcb.14983	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14983		FEB 2020						31912589					WOS:000512728000001

This study aims to determine the parameters controlling the sedimentary and environmental dynamics and, consequently, the climatic dynamics. Waters in the lac are calc-magnesian, relatively alkaline, and well-oxygenated. Water dilution materializes the climatic influence from the hot season (summer) to the cold season (winter). The sedimentological and geochemical studies of surface sediments provide information on detrital sedimentation dominated by the silty-clayey fraction resulting directly from the erosion of the watershed. At Tamda cores, the sedimentary record shows three lithostratigraphic units. They represent three distinct sedimentary and geochemical deposition phases, marking three stages of lake-level fluctuation. Going toward the lake's center, there is a decrease in coarse fractions and carbonates and an increase in fine particles, organic matter, and magnetic susceptibility. The reasonably high carbonate contents at the edges are related to detrital inputs. The low levels of organic matter are linked to the current lowering of the lake level, while the low sedimentation rate is connected to the decrease in terrigenous inputs by water flows. Recent sedimentation at Lake Tamda is influenced by Allochthonous production, including seasonal inputs from the watershed and sometimes wind sedimentation.					; Jamal, ABBACH/ABE-5490-2022; ETEBAAI, Issam/AAX-4819-2021; Talibi, Hajar/AAP-5687-2020; El Moussaoui, Said/AAP-4746-2020	ETEBAAI, Issam/0000-0001-5941-656X; EL MOUSSAOUI, Said/0000-0002-0271-1485; CHERKAOUI DEKKAKI, Hinde/0000-0002-7501-0604; Abbach, Jamal/0000-0002-9729-5866; 													1464-343X	1879-1956				JUN	2023	202								104922	10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2023.104922	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2023.104922		MAR 2023											WOS:000959763900001

Mean catch per unit effort (CPUE) of catfish (all Ictaluridae) in crawls was lower than from other Florida waters, while mean CPUE of catfish in wire traps was similar to traps set in other Florida waters. Length at age indicated mean growth rates of female channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus and white catfish Ameiurus catus were slightly greater than males. Ages of sampled channel catfish ranged from 2 to 10 years, and white catfish from 2 to 7 years. Channel catfish and white catfish growth rates were slow when compared to other Florida waters. Invertebrates were the dominant food items in channel catfish, even in fish greater than 600 mm total length, but detritus comprised 64% of all stomach contents by weight. Invertebrates were also the dominant food items in white catfish with detritus comprising almost 67% of all stomach contents by weight. Channel catfish never targeted fish as food, whereas invertebrates in white catfish stomachs were present only in association with detritus.																			0892-2284		1-888569-19-0				1999	24						115	119																WOS:000086864000007

The structures and chemical properties of laminated and unlaminated loose surface sediments are described. Laminations are formed by accumulation of organic rich matter and associated formation of sulfides during winters, and precipitation of authigenic manganese-carbonate from the watermass above during summers. We observed that the laminations are not any more visible in recent Gotland Deep (F-81) sediments possibly due to accelerated sulfate reduction and methanogenesis close to the sediment surface. Early diagenetic processes, associated with sulfur and carbon, were found to control the occurrence of many elements. The distribution patterns of iron, manganese, molybdenum, copper, lead, carbon and sulfur were found to be changed because they are dissolved to interstitial water. In anoxic sediments the temporal framework is not always useful for evaluating metal trends, but shifting chemical environments and associated diagenetic processes affect the shape of metal profiles. In oxidized conditions, the postdepositional changes due to mineralization of carbon and sulfur compounds occur at greater sediment depths, and they do not affect the chemical properties of surface sediments.																			0025-3227					DEC	1995	129	1-2					101	109		10.1016/0025-3227(95)00114-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0025-3227(95)00114-X													WOS:A1995TM82600006

Episodes of low dissolved oxygen indicated by ostracodes and sediment geochemistry at Crystal Lake, Illinois, USA	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Low dissolved oxygen during the summer and early fall controls profundal continental ostracode distribution in Crystal Lake (McHenry County), Illinois, favoring Cypria ophthalmica and Physocypria globula at water depths from 6 to 13 m. These species also thrived in the lake's profundal zone from 14,165 to 9600 calendar year before present (cal yr B. P.) during the late Bolling, Allerod, and Younger Dryas chronozones, and early Holocene. Characterized by sand, cemented tubules, large aquatic gastropod shells, and littoral ostracode valves, thin (1-6 cm) tempestite deposits punctuate thicker deposits of organic gyttja from 16,080 to 11,900 cal yr B. P. The succeeding 2300 yr (11,900-9600 cal yr B. P.) lack tempestites, and reconstructed water depths were at their maximum. Deposition of marl under relatively well-oxygenated conditions occurred during the remainder of the Holocene until the arrival of Europeans, when the lake returned to a pattern of seasonally low dissolved oxygen. Such conditions are also indicated in the lake sediment by the speciation of phosphorus, high concentrations of organic carbon, and abundant iron and manganese occluded to mineral grains. Initial low dissolved oxygen was probably caused by the delivery of dissolved P and Fe in shallow groundwater, the chemistry of which was influenced by Spodosol pedogenesis under a spruce forest. The triggering may have been regionally warm and wet conditions associated with retreat of the Lake Michigan lobe (south-central Laurentide Ice Sheet).

J	MACAN, TT				MACAN, TT			ECOLOGY OF FRESH-WATER MOLLUSCA IN THE ENGLISH LAKE DISTRICT	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												The Lake District is a mountainous area with rocks poor in lime. It is convenient to distinguish lakes, tarns, and pools. The common spp. in Windermere, Lymnaea pereger, Planorbis carinatus, P. albus, P. contortus. Physa fontinalis, and Valvata piscinalis, occur on the stony shore, in reed-beds and in submerged vegetation in deeper water; the last 3 occur significantly more often in submerged vegetation than elsewhere. Lakes can be arranged in a series from Ennerdale, lying on a hard little-weathered and little-cultivated drainage basin, to Esthwaite, lying in softer rocks which, having weathered more, yield more nutrient salts. In Ennerdale only Limnaea pereger is recorded; in Crummock, another barren "primitive" lake, Physa fontinalis is found as well. In the remaining lakes 5 of the 6 spp. common in Windermere and frequently L. palustris as well are found. Planorbis carinatus is known only from Windermere; its arrival is possibly recent. Most tarns on the higher fells are glacial in origin, those lower down artificial. The latter have a richer flora and a rapid succession of plant spp. Ca content and alkalinity-vary in different parts of a heavily overgrown tarn from one inflowing stream to another and at different times according to the rainfall. The alkalinity fluctuates more than the Ca. Concns. of Ca and alkalinity were usually, but not invariably, lowest in a winter wet spell and highest in a summer dry spell. Ca concn. fluctuates most in tarns which have reached the swamp stage. All tarns are characterized by a low Ca concn., when comparison is made with other parts of the country. Few high natural tarns, few pools, but most artificial tarns harbour snails. L. pereger was not found in any of the pools. It was absent from 8 out of 40 tarns; 5 of these had less than 3.0 mg. Ca/l. in the wet winter sample and three were woodland tarns. Planorbis albus occurs most often and in greatest numbers in tarns with sub-merged vegetation and becomes scarcer as the tarn becomes overgrown. A high alkalinity relative to Ca is favorable. V. piscinalis, Physa fontinalis and Planorbis contortus are associated with each other, with L. palustris, and with scarcity of L. pereger. L. glabra is found in a few places where there is thick vegetation and Sphagnum. Since such conditions are found widely, the scarcity of L. glabra is unaccountable. L. stagnalis, Planorbis complanatus. and P. crista are confined to locations of higher general Ca level. P. spirorbis occurs in two lakes and one temporary pool. Viviparus fasciatus was flourishing in 1948 in a tarn into which it had almost certainly been introduced in 1939. Ancylastrum fluviatile occurs in lakes, streams and tarns, almost wherever there is a substratum of rock or stones. Ancylus lacustris occurs in Windermere on Phragmites stems, and in a quarry pool. Eleven species of Pisidium fall into a "lake" group and a "tarn-pool" group, but this is based mainly on shallow-water collections. Other lamellibranchs recorded are Sphaerium corneum and S. lacustre, Unio pictorum and Margaritifera margaritifera.																			0021-8790	1365-2656					1950	19	2					124	146		10.2307/1523	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1523													WOS:A1950XX15500004

An assessment of long-term hydroclimate change in those regions remains unquantified at a global scale as of yet. By integrating lake records, PMIP3-CMIP5 simulations and modern observations, we assess the wet-dry status of global closed basins during the Last Glacial Maximum, mid-Holocene, pre-industrial, and 20th and 21st century periods. Results show comparable patterns of general wetter climate during the mid-Holocene and near-future warm period, mainly attributed to the boreal summer and winter precipitation increasing, respectively. The long-term pattern of moisture change is highly related to the highlatitude ice sheets and low-latitude solar radiation, which leads to the poleward moving of westerlies and strengthening of monsoons during the interglacial period. However, modern moisture changes show correlations with El Nino-Southern Oscillation in most closed basins, such as the opposite significant correlations between North America and southern Africa and between central Eurasia and Australia, indicating strong connection with ocean oscillation. The strategy for combating future climate change should be more resilient to diversified hydroclimate responses in different closed basins.

Pintails were radio tagged during August - early October at MWA (n = 116), other San Joaquin Valley areas (n = 27), or Suisun Marsh (n = 2). Before duck hunting season (i.e., Prehunt), pintail distribution at MWA generally tracked marsh flooding although distribution was more concentrated during the day than night. During duck hunting season (i.e., Hunt), pintails that had not left MWA sought sanctuary on units closed to shooting and at night dispersed throughout the area; most returned to sanctuary units on both shoot (Wednesdays and weekends) and nonshoot days. Pintails present during Posthunt (i.e., after Hunt ended) dispersed throughout MWA. Pintails avoided the central lake in favor of the more shallow marsh units throughout MWA. Among the marsh units, pintails selected open and avoided heavily vegetated units at night. Open marsh units Were also selected during the day during Posthunt and, except in 1993, during Prehunt. However, closed or hemi marshes were selected during day during Hunt. Marshes where swamp timothy, Heleochloa schoenoides, was the dominant or prominent understory plant were always selected and received more use by pintails than any other marsh type. Watergrass, Echinochloa crusgalli, marsh was avoided during the day but, along with timothy marsh, selected at night most years. Selection of marsh where alkali bulrush, Scirpus patudosus, or other non-timothy or non-watergrass plants were primary understory plants ranked in the middle during the day but were avoided at night. Our finding that foraging pintails selected swamp timothy is consistent with food habits and habitat use reported elsewhere, but the greater use of watergrass marsh at MWA than in the Grassland Ecological Area indicates regional differences in management or pintail ecology. Exodus of pintails coinciding with start of Hunt indicates that some aspect of the sanctuary or other habitats were lacking at MWA, and will need to be improved to maintain pintail use all winter.																			0008-1078					FAL	2005	91	4					270	285																WOS:000233422400003

Annual mean density of total soil macroarthropods at these sites varied from 312 to 1,809 individuals/m(2); highest density was recorded near the center of the gradient. The most abundant groups of soil arthropods were Isopoda, predominantly Armadillidium vulgare (Latreille), and Diptera larvae (mostly Limoniidae, Chironomidae and Bibionidae). Species of five genera of Chironomidae (Paraphaenocladius sp., Pseudosmittia sp., Metriocnemus sp., Bryophaenocladius sp., and Smittia sp.) were found. Total number of macroarthropod species at individual sites varied between 40 and 70. The majority (61-92%) of soil macroarthropods from all sites was recovered from the near-surface stratum. Proportion of soil macroarthropods found in the two deeper strata increased with distance from the shoreline, elevation above lake water level, soil carbon content, and acidity of soil. The two sites located near the shoreline were continually flooded from September to January after the lake water level increased by up to 30 cm. Two inland sites were periodically (June-September) flooded by rain water. Flooding at either site caused decreased density of soil macroarthropods, with the effect of lake flooding being more pronounced. Density of soil macroarthropods at flood-affected sites peaked during spring, whereas seasonal changes in density of these invertebrates at most upland sites were less pronounced and peaked in autumn. Results indicated that seasonal migration and recolortization by soil macroartbropods along the moisture gradient are important strategies to overcome flood-affected population losses.

Detection of Microcystin- Producing Cyanobacteria in Missisquoi Bay, Quebec, Canada, Using Quantitative PCR	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Toxic cyanobacterial blooms, as well as their increasing global occurrence, pose a serious threat to public health, domestic animals, and livestock. In Missisquoi Bay, Lake Champlain, public health advisories have been issued from 2001 to 2009, and local microcystin concentrations found in the lake water regularly exceeded the Canadian drinking water guideline of 1.5 mu g liter(-1). A quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) approach was developed for the detection of blooms formed by microcystin-producing cyanobacteria. Primers were designed for the beta-ketoacyl synthase (mcyD(KS)) and the first dehydratase domain (mcyD(DH)) of the mcyD gene, involved in microcystin synthesis. The Q-PCR method was used to track the toxigenic cyanobacteria in Missisquoi Bay during the summers of 2006 and 2007. Two toxic bloom events were detected in 2006: more than 6.5 x 10(4) copies of the mcyD(KS) gene ml(-1) were detected in August, and an average of 4.0 x 10(4) copies ml(-1) were detected in September, when microcystin concentrations were more than 4 mu g liter(-1) and approximately 2 mu g liter(-1), respectively. Gene copy numbers and total microcystin concentrations (determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) were highly correlated in the littoral (r = 0.93, P < 0.001) and the pelagic station (r = 0.87, P < 0.001) in 2006. In contrast to the situation in 2006, a cyanobacterial bloom occurred only in late summer-early fall of 2007, reaching only 3 x 10(2) mcyD(KS) copies ml(-1), while the microcystin concentration was barely detectable. The Q-PCR method allowed the detection of microcystin-producing cyanobacteria when toxins and toxigenic cyanobacterial abundance were still below the limit of detection by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and microscopy. Toxin gene copy numbers grew exponentially at a steady rate over a period of 7 weeks. Onshore winds selected for cells with a higher cell quota of microcystin. This technique could be an effective approach for the routine monitoring of the most at-risk water bodies.

J	Sogut, DV; Jensen, RE; Farhadzadeh, A				Sogut, Deniz Velioglu; Jensen, Robert E.; Farhadzadeh, Ali			Characterizing Lake Ontario Marine Renewable Energy Resources	MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL												Lake Ontario, the smallest in surface area among the Great Lakes, is the last lake in the Great Lakes' hydrologic chain. In this study, Lake Ontario's marine renewable energy resources are characterized. The historical wave records reveal up to 8 m significant wave heights in Lake Ontario's eastern basin. Furthermore, the lake's historical water level data indicate that storm surges can get as large as 1 m near Port Weller and Burlington. The storms of November 13, 2003, and January 30, 2008, are estimated to produce a total theoretical potential energy of similar to 25 GWh. The lake-wide monthly mean wave power for the selected year 2011 is at its peak in October and November, exceeding 10 kW/m. On the other hand, it is estimated to be around 1 kW/m during late spring and summer. The present work is part of an extensive study attempting to characterize marine renewable energy resources for the entire Great Lakes and follows the recently published works on Lake Erie and Lake Michigan (Farhadzadeh et al., 2017; Velioglu Sogut et al., 2018). It is also the first study elaborating on the characterization of Lake Ontario's marine renewable energy resources.

J	HELLSTEN, ME; STENSON, JAE				HELLSTEN, ME; STENSON, JAE			CYCLOMORPHOSIS IN A POPULATION OF BOSMINA-COREGONI	HYDROBIOLOGIA												A population of cyclomorphic Bosmina coregoni was studied in Lake Ostersjon, southwestern Sweden and results from field samples collected in 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1991 are presented. Animals collected in summer have remarkably higher carapace and prolonged antennule compared to what we call the normal morph. In 1991 the extreme morph reach its maximum body length, body height and antennule length in July to September. The occurrence of the extreme morph coincide with the hatching of the predaceous cladoceran Leptodora kindtii. The two morphs fluctuate in abundance and in relation to each other. In early spring only the normal morph occurred in the samples followed by a period of about two months when the two morphs were found together, in July only the extreme morph was found. In September the two morphs were again present in the lake. As has been shown for other cladoceran, the conspicuous carapace and antennule could be an adaptive response that decreases mortality due to invertebrate predation. Spectacular features like these are likely also accompanied by some sort of costs.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP 8	1995	312	1					1	9		10.1007/BF00018881	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00018881													WOS:A1995TJ78300001

Although the zooplankton fauna in artificial water bodies would be expected to vary according to differences in inundation periods, scientific confirmation of this relation is largely lacking. Due to its ubiquity, the cladoceran Moina is a suitable target for studying habitat-related differences in the planktonic fauna, but its taxonomy remains unresolved, making morphological identifications potentially uncertain. We thus applied integrative taxonomy with both morphological and genetic evaluations for reliable species delimitation to Moina samples collected primarily in Japan (with smaller collections from Taiwan). This approach increased the alpha diversity of Moina species in Japan from three (in previous studies) to seven. It also revealed different habitat preferences among Moina species, with the smaller species being distributed mostly in farm ponds (followed by natural lakes), and the larger species mostly in rice fields. We argue that the phenological match/mismatch with inundation period of rice fields was a major factor for this strong trend of spatial species turnover, with differing degrees of fish predation pressure among the habitat types being another factor.

Air Monitoring of Polychlorinated Biphenyls and Organochlorine Pesticides in Eastern Siberia: Levels, Temporal Trends, and Risk Assessment	ATMOSPHERE												In this study, we evaluate the long-term and seasonal variations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), alpha-, gamma-hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCH), and p,p '-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p '-DDT) and its metabolites through a passive air sampling method at two (urban and suburban) stations in Eastern Siberia, Russia, in 2011-2017. The median levels of HCB, n-ary sumation HCHs, n-ary sumation DDTs, n-ary sumation PCB39, and n-ary sumation PCB6 in the air were 116, 84, 55, 128, and 41 pg/m(3) and 83, 21, 11, 52, and 16 pg/m(3) at the urban and suburban stations, respectively. PCB and HCH levels in the air of Irkutsk decreased considerably in the 2000s, in comparison to the late 1980s and early 1990s, while an increasing trend was observed for HCB during the 2010s. The seasonality of air concentrations (with summer concentrations higher than winter concentrations) was well exhibited by PCB, HCH, and DDT, but not HCB. Significant correlations were observed between approximately all studied persistent organic pollutants and the average air temperature, quantity of precipitation, and frequency of the prevailing wind direction during the sampling period. The daily doses of PCBs, DDTs, HCHs, and HCB under human exposure by inhalation amounted to 38, 21, 27, and 35 and 17, 6, 7, and 27 pg/kg body weight per day in urban and suburban areas, respectively.

J	Kim, BH; Han, MS; Takamura, N				Kim, BH; Han, MS; Takamura, N			Effects of fish introduction on the length of the tail of cryptomonads in mesocosm experiments	OECOLOGIA												Two different morphs of the small cryptomonad, Plagioselmis prolonga var. nordica with a posterior tail, were observed during summer and fall in the hypertrophic lake, Lake Kasumigaura, Japan. The tail shortened in mesocosms stocked with planktivorous silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix Val.) and elongated by more than 50% in mesocosms from which silver carp were removed. The density of Plagioselmis cells increased significantly upon fish stocking and decreased upon fish removal. The tail length was negatively correlated with algal abundance and positively correlated with crustacean densities, but there was no correlation with nutrient levels or physical environmental parameters in the mesocosms. The variation in tail length was induced by the presence/absence of fish, but was not related to their density. However, silver carp manipulation strongly affected the density of the majority of zooplankters and, interestingly, there was a strong correlation between zooplankton density and tail-length change in Plagioselmis. We propose a possible herbivore-induced defense mechanism triggered by the top predator, silver carp.																			0029-8549	1432-1939				JUN	2003	136	1					73	79		10.1007/s00442-003-1226-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-003-1226-3								12820066					WOS:000183638000008

Monitoring was conducted for 13 months to compare and contrast the acid-base chemistry of the terrestrial and aquatic portions of the watershed. Variations in Al concentration and speciation in drainage waters were correlated with changes in the supply of naturally occurring organic ligands. During the study period, the pond retained 28% of Al inputs, including nearly half of the inputs of organically complexed Al. Chemical equilibrium calculations indicated that the entire water-column was oversaturated with respect to the solubility of synthetic gibbsite during summer, as was the hypolimnion during winter. Retention of Al resulted from an increase in pH in the hypolimnion concomitant with SO42- reduction, and from loss of organic anions in epilimnetic waters. Acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) generated in the pond primarily through SO42- reduction and base cation (CB) release was balanced by ANC consumed as a result of Al retention.

Distribution of Pacific Lamprey Entosphenus tridentatus in Watersheds of Puget Sound Based on Smolt Monitoring Data	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												Lamprey populations are in decline worldwide and the status of Pacific lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus) is a topic of current interest. They and other lamprey species cycle nutrients and serve as prey in riverine ecosystems. To determine the current distribution of Pacific lamprey in major watersheds flowing into Puget Sound, Washington, we sampled lamprey captured during salmonid smolt monitoring that occurred from late winter to mid-summer. We found Pacific lamprey in 12 of 18 watersheds and they were most common in southern Puget Sound watersheds and in watersheds draining western Puget Sound (Hood Canal). Two additional species, western brook lamprey (Lampetra richardsoni) and river lamprey (L. ayresii) were more common in eastern Puget Sound watersheds. Few Pacific lamprey macrophthalmia were found, suggesting that the majority of juveniles migrated seaward during other time periods. In addition, "dwarf" adult Pacific lamprey (< 300 mm) were observed in several watersheds and may represent an alternate life history for some Puget Sound populations. Based on genetic data, the use of visual techniques to identify lamprey ammocoetes as Entosphenus or Lampetra was successful for 97% (34 of 35) of the samples we evaluated.

Our database consists of year-round measurements of the photosynthetically active radiation (400-700 nm) under the ice, measurements of the spatial variation of the under-ice light in midsummer, and spectrally resolved measurements from 400 to 700 nm of the albedo and transmission of the ice cover in early (November) and in midsummer (January). Our results show that the transmission decreases in the first part of summer, dropping by a factor of approximately 4 from November to January. We suggest that this is due to heating in the upper layers of the ice cover and the formation of Tyndall figures. Later in the summer when a significant liquid water fraction occurs within the ice cover, the transmission increases. In the fall when the ice cover freezes solid the transmission drops markedly. The spectrally resolved measurements from 400 to 700 nm show that approximately 2-5% of the incident light in this spectral region penetrates the 3.5-m thick ice cover. We have analyzed the spectral data using a two-stream scattering solution to the radiative transfer equation with three vertical layers in the ice cover. A surficial glaze of scattering ice 1 cm thick overlies a layer of sandy, bubbly ice about a meter thick, and below this is a thick layer of sand-free ice with bubbles. We find that the ice cover is virtually opaque at wavelengths longer than 800 nm. The net transmission of solar energy is approximately 2%. Significant changes in the thickness of the ice cover have been reported at Lake Hoare. These are due primarily to changes in the thickness of the bottom layer only. Because this layer is relatively clear, the effect on the transmission through the ice cover from these changes is less than would be predicted assuming a homogeneous ice cover.					; Andersen, Dale/B-4816-2013	McKay, Christopher/0000-0002-6243-1362; Andersen, Dale/0000-0001-8827-1259; 													2169-9275	2169-9291				OCT 15	1994	99	C10					20427	20444		10.1029/94JC01414	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/94JC01414													WOS:A1994PM27600009

It is postulated that beta-cyclocitral is a key compound for regulating the occurrence of cyanobacteria and related microorganisms in an aquatic environment. beta-Cyclocitral is sensitively detected when a high density of the cells is achieved from late summer to autumn. Moreover, it is expected to be involved in changes in the species composition of cyanobacteria in a lake. Although several analysis methods for beta-cyclocitral have already been reported, beta-cyclocitral could be detected using only solid phase micro-extraction (SPME), whereas it could not be found at all using the solvent extraction method in a previous study. In this study, we investigated why fi-cyclocitral was detected using only SPME GC/MS. Particularly, three operations in SPME, i.e., extraction temperature, sample stirring rate, and the effect of salt, were examined for the production of fi-cyclocitral. Among these, heating (60 degrees C) was critical for the beta-cyclocitral formation. Furthermore, acidification with a 1-h storage was more effective than heating when comparing the obtained amounts. The present results indicated that beta-cyclocitral did not exist as the intact form in cells, because it was formed by heating or acidification of the resulting intermediates during the analysis by SPME. The obtained results would be helpful to understand the formation and role of beta-cyclocitral in an aquatic environment.					; Harada, Ken-ichi/ISU-7680-2023	Bober, Beata/0000-0003-3520-4639; 														1420-3049				FEB 2	2020	25	4							832	10.3390/molecules25040832	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules25040832								32075007					WOS:000522454500068

Compared with considerable studies for oligotrophic lakes, estuaries, and open ocean, few evidence for the importance of N deposition have been directly provided for eutrophic lakes. Our high-resolution systematic observations of N deposition over Lake Dianchi (the sixth largest freshwater lake in China), along with simultaneous measurements of riverine N exports, permit new insight into the contribution of N deposition to total N loads. Annual atmospheric N deposition accounted for 15.7-16.6% of total N loads under changing precipitation regime, twofold higher than previous estimates (7.6%) for the Lake Dianchi. It increased to 27-48% in the critical stage (May and June) when toxic blooms of the ubiquitous non-N-2-fixing cyanobacteria Microcystis spp. are initiated and proliferate. Our observations reveal that reduced N (59%) contributes a greater amount than oxidized N to total N deposition, reaching 56-83% from late spring to summer. Progress toward mitigating eutrophication in part of lakes will be difficult without reductions in ammonia emissions and subsequent N deposition.

The sediment records were compared with seasonal and annual air temperature trends calculated for the elevation (2417 m a. s. l.) and the geographical position (47degrees13'46"N, 11degrees00'51"E) of the lake, and with precipitation records available since 1866 from Innsbruck. Temperature trends followed a 20 30 year oscillation between cold and warm periods. Regarding long-term changes, temperature trends showed a U-shaped trend between 1780 and 1950, followed by a steep increase since 1975. Physical, geochemical, and organic parameters were not controlled by air temperature. Among the biological records only diatoms and chrysophytes reacted to air temperature changes: the relative abundance of planktonic diatoms increased during warm periods and changes in mean annual alpine air temperature explained 36.5% of their variation. The relation between abundance of seasonal stomatocyst types and air temperature varied on two different time scales: while summer stomatocysts were influenced by short term temperature fluctuations, the autumn stomatocysts were affected only by the long term changes. Other biological parameters exhibited a constant species composition ( chironomids, pigments) or changes were small and independent of temperature ( cladocera). Spheroidal carbonaceous fly-ash particles, and trends in Pb and Cr indicated increasing deposition of atmospheric pollutants but had no detectable effects on the biological parameters either. In respect to temperature variations over the last 200 years, this alpine lake is much less sensitive than expected and has thus to be regarded as a well buffered site. However, temperature alone is not sufficient to understand changes in species composition and other biogeochemical processes with unknown historical patterns might have affected species composition more strongly.

Habitat use was assessed by regressing fish count data against habitat survey information across thirty study sites using generalised linear mixed models. Habitat associations were examined by age-0 and age-1+ cohorts separately, providing an opportunity to compare habitat use across different juvenile coho salmon life stages during freshwater rearing. Regression results indicated that the age-0 cohorts were strongly associated with shallow, wide stream reaches with in-stream vegetation, whereas age-1+ cohorts were associated with deeper stream reaches. Furthermore, associations between fork length and habitat characteristics suggest cohort-specific habitat use patterns are distinct from those attributable to fish size. Habitat use information generated from this study is being used to guide optimal fish passage restoration planning in the Big Lake drainage. Evidence for habitat use partitioning by age cohort during freshwater juvenile rearing indicates that pooling age cohorts into a single juvenile stage for the purposes of watershed management may mask important habitat use dynamics.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				OCT	2017	26	4					695	706		10.1111/eff.12317	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12317													WOS:000409505000018

Robotic monitoring to assess impacts of zebra mussels and assimilative capacity for a river	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Water quality impacts of zebra mussel metabolism over an infested 15 km reach of the Seneca River, N.Y., are documented, based on vertically and temporally detailed robotic monitoring at the reach boundaries during the summer through early fall intervals of 2 years. Substantial reductions over the study reach are documented for dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, fluorometric chlorophyll a, and turbidity, associated with the metabolism of this invader. Violations of New York State water quality standards for DO that would not be resolved by traditional manual monitoring programs were observed. The loss of assimilative capacity caused by the zebra mussel invasion is confounding rehabilitation efforts for a downstream polluted lake that had considered diversion of municipal effluent to the river. The critical role robotic monitoring units would play in an automated control system for an innovative strategy of time-variable river discharge of the effluent is described. Near-real time robotic monitoring provides a more detailed understanding of the impacts of zebra mussels on water quality than traditional less intensive manual measurements.

J	Thompson, SA; Price, JJ				Thompson, Stephanie A.; Price, J. Jordan			Water clarity and diving behavior in wintering Common Loons	WATERBIRDS												Studies of the Common Loon (Gavia immer) during its breeding season on northern freshwater lakes in North America have suggested that water quality has an influence on breeding and foraging success. Less is known, however, about the effects of water quality on loon behavior during the winter, which is spent in estuarine and marine environments. In this study, we investigated the effects of water clarity and tidal stage on loon diving behavior at seven sites along a Maryland estuary. At each site, the total number of loons observed and mean dive durations of individuals were measured and compared to various measurements of water clarity, including Secchi depth and turbidity, and to tidal stage. Dive durations were positively associated with Secchi depth, which indicates that birds dove for longer periods in areas with higher water clarity. Dives were also longer during low tide in comparison to other tidal stages. No relationship was found between aspects of water clarity and the distribution of wintering loons.																			1524-4695	1938-5390				JUN	2006	29	2					169	175		10.1675/1524-4695(2006)29[169:WCADBI]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/1524-4695(2006)29[169:WCADBI]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000238788400006

It is a product of long-term and ingenuous human modifications of wetland landscapes. In the pre-Qin Period, 3000 years ago, the poldered area of eastern Wuhu city was once a large lake called the ancient Danyang wetland. The introduction of agricultural civilization and polder technology to the area during the Wu and Yue Kingdoms period gradually transformed it into an agricultural area. With an accelerating rate of land reclamation under a changing late-Holocene regional climate, the ancient Danyang wetland became an aquatic system strongly influenced by intensifying anthropogenic activities. In this study, based on field survey data, historical documents, and remote-sensing and archaeological data, we reconstructed the spatial distribution of the polder landscape over the last 3000 years and identified their structural diversity. We found that polder landscapes began to emerge in the Spring and Autumn Period, land reclamation intensified in the Three Kingdoms and developed rapidly in the Song Dynasty before eventually reaching the peak from the Ming and Qing Dynasties. The relocation of historical sites to low-altitude areas also marked the expansion of poldered fields from the center of the wetland to the southeast and northwest. The development and evolution of the polder landscape are related to regional climate conditions, changing social and economic statuses, and the development of agricultural technology in the Song Dynasty and succeeding periods.

Such fluctuations may also cause displacement of springs that discharge these aquifers. Using a calibrated numerical model, an extreme example of such phenomenon is observed in the Dead Sea rift valley and the adjacent Eastern Mountain Aquifer of the Judea and Samaria Mountains. Lake levels along the Dead Sea rift have changed dramatically and rapidly by hundreds of meters, followed by changes in the lake areas by hundreds of square kilometers. Simultaneously, the aquifer exhibited spring displacements, both on large and small scales. Currently, 50% of the aquifer water discharge in the Zuqim zone, and 10% north of the Dead Sea. But in the past, only 30% discharged at Zuqim and 40% north of the Dead Sea. There is evidence for such an occurrence in the past, and it is likely to recur in the future, based on the predicted progressive decline of the current Dead Sea level. This may have an impact on wetland habitats along the coast.

J	Shi, K; Li, YM; Li, L; Lu, H				Shi, Kun; Li, Yunmei; Li, Lin; Lu, Heng			Absorption characteristics of optically complex inland waters: Implications for water optical classification	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Multiple bio-optical measurements were conducted in inland waters of China, including Lake Taihu [spring and autumn], Lake Chaohu, Lake Dianchi, and Three Gorges Reservoirs. The variations in the absorption characteristics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), phytoplankton, and non-algal particles (NAP) and their relative contributions to total absorption among these waters were analyzed. The obtained results indicated that these areas are representative of the optically complex inland waters characterized by strong regional variations of their absorption properties. By means of the relative contributions of NAP and phytoplankton to the total water absorption at 550 and 675nm, these waters were classified into three optical water types, each one having specific biogeochemical and optical properties. Two of the types were distinct and corresponded to waters that are optically controlled by NAP (Type I) and dominated by phytoplankton (Type III). Type II was related to relatively optically mixed waters where the absorption properties are controlled by NAP and phytoplankton. Additionally, the differences in remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) spectra among the three classified water types were clarified to establish optical criteria for identifying these water types. On this basis, the classification criteria for MERIS images were developed, which allowed one to cluster every R-rs spectrum into one of the three water types by comparing the values from band 6, band 8, and band 9 of MERIS images. The proposed criteria were subsequently conducted to map the water types of Lake Taihu using MERIS images.

J	Wang, YM; Peng, YL; Wang, DY; Zhang, C				Wang, Yongmin; Peng, Yulong; Wang, Dingyong; Zhang, Cheng			Wet deposition fluxes of total mercury and methylmercury in core urban areas, Chongqing, China	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Wet deposition fluxes of mercury (Hg) species were estimated during the period from June 2010 to July 2011 at 3 sites in core urban areas in Chongqing, China. Rain water was collected by automatic deposition sampler for total Hg (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) analyses. Our results showed that annual wet deposition fluxes of THg and MeHg were 28.7 +/- 5.1 and 0.28 +/- 0.09 mu g m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. We estimate that MeHg wet deposition contributes 9.2-19.6% of the total MeHg flux to a local reservoir. Cumulative THg fluxes collected from nine principal rainfall events (>1.5 mu g m(-2) yr(-1)) at three sampling sites accounted for 20% of annual overall THg wet deposition. Statistical analyses yielded significant relationship between rainfall amounts and Hg wet deposition fluxes (r(2) = 0.76, p < 0.01 for THg; r(2) = 0.65, p < 0.01 for MeHg), suggesting that rainfall is one of the most important factors controlling the Hg fluxes. Obvious seasonal variations of THg fluxes were observed, with the maximum value occurring in summer (accounting for 40% of total annual THg deposition) while minimum values occurred in winter in all the three sampling sites. 72-h backward trajectory analysis on nine large deposition events at the three sites, using HYSPLIT model indicated that most of air masses which contain a relatively high precipitation amount and pass through major Hg sources would have an elevated Hg load.

J	Zhang, Y; Sperber, KR; Boyle, JS				Zhang, Y; Sperber, KR; Boyle, JS			Climatology and interannual variation of the East Asian winter monsoon: Results from the 1979-95 NCEP/NCAR reanalysis	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												This paper presents the climatology and interannual variation of the East Asian winter monsoon based on the 1979-95 National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis. In addition to documenting the frequency, intensity, and preferred propagation tracks of cold surges and the evolution patterns of related fields, the authors discuss the temporal distribution of the Siberian high and cold surges. Further, the interannual variation of the cold surges and winter monsoon circulation and its relationship with ENSO were examined. There are on average 13 cold surges in each winter season (October-April), of which two are strong cases. The average intensity of cold surges, measured by maximum sea level pressure, is 1053 hPa. The cold surges originate from two source regions: 1) northwest of Lake Baikal, and 2) north of Lake Balkhash. The typical evolution of a cold surge occurs over a period of 5-14 days. Trajectory and correlation analyses indicate that, during this time, high pressure centers propagate southeastward around the edge of the Tibetan Plateau from the mentioned source regions. Some of these high pressure centers then move eastward and diminish over the oceans, while others proceed southward. The signatures of the associated temperature, wind, and pressure fields propagate farther southward and eastward. The affected area encompasses the bulk of the maritime continent. Although the intensity of the Siberian high peaks during December and January, the frequency of cold surges reaches a maximum in November and in March. This result suggests that November through March should be considered as the East Asian winter monsoon season. Two stratifications of cold surges are used to examine the relationship between ENSO and the interannual variation of the winter monsoon. The first one, described as conventional cold surges, indicates that the surge frequency reaches a minimum a year after El Nino events. The second one, defined as a maximum wind event near the South China Sea, shares the same origin as the first. The surge frequency is in good agreement with the Southern Oscillation index (SOI). A low (high) SOI event coincides with a low (high) frequency of cold surges. The interannual variation of winter northerlies near the South China Sea is dominated by the South China Sea cold surges and is well correlated (R = 0.82) with the SOI. Strong wind seasons are associated with La Nina and high SOI years; on the other hand, weak wind seasons are associated with El Nino and low SOI years. This pattern is restricted to an area north of the equator within the region of (0 degrees-20 degrees N,100 degrees-130 degrees E) and is confined to the near-surface layer. The SST variation in the same region is similar to the wind pattern but lags the wind for approximately 1-5 months, which suggests that the SST variation is forced by the wind. The surface Siberian high, 500-hPa trough, and 200-hPa jet stream, all representing the large-scale monsoon flow, are weaker than normal during El Nino years. In particular, the interannual variation of the Siberian high is in general agreement with the SOI.

The Arxan volcanic field features multiple gas emission sites (e.g., Jinjianggou hot springs and Yinjianggou hot springs) and exhibits strong hydrothermal activity. In this study, measurements of the hot spring gas composition and soil CO2 flux in the Arxan Holocene volcanic field were conducted, and the results were combined with previous research results to analyze the degassing characteristics of this region. The results show that the volcanic gases in the Arxan volcanic field are composed of 0.07%-1.09% CO2, 0.33-12 ppm CH4, 1.57-53 ppm H-2, 800-30,241 ppm He, and 1.14%-1.86% Ar. The He content in this area is notably higher than that in other dormant volcanoes in China. This difference is possibly caused by U-Th decay in the Mesozoic granodiorite and acidic volcanic rocks in the study area, which can produce substantial radiogenic He. The soil gas concentrations near the Jinjianggou and Yinjianggou hot springs are higher than those of two Holocene volcanoes. The peak CO2 concentration in the soil near the Jinjianggou hot spring can reach 35,161 ppm. The single-site soil microseepage CO2 flux in the Arxan volcanic field is 4.66-107.18 g m(-2) d(-1), and the estimated annual CO2 emission flux from the volcanic field to the atmosphere is 0.63 x 10(5) t, which also demonstrates that soil CO2 flux of Arxan volcano is comparable to the soil CO2 emission level of the Iwojima volcano.						guan, sheng/0000-0002-3218-425X														2296-6463				MAY 24	2023	11								1174315	10.3389/feart.2023.1174315	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2023.1174315													WOS:001007425200001

The duration of the summer camp was five and a half days in the Feldberg Lake District in northeast Germany (federal state of Mecklenburg Western Pomerania). The participants took part in the continuation of the examination of the lakes in the region, which leads back more than 50 years. They gained hands-on experience in environmental characterization of various lakes and classification by determining chemical, physical, and biological parameters such as phytoplankton, zooplankton, and macrophytes. Short lectures are presented by professionals covering a theoretical background of limnology, environmental chemistry, a variety of analytical methods, freshwater biology, and the specifics of the region. The camp in its present form was established in 1995, and about 20 students took part in the camp per year. Camp development, considerations regarding employed analytical methods, balance of theory, and other implications are discussed.

Analysis of delta N-15 and delta C-13 stable isotopes was carried out to trace how taxa with different trophic levels and carbon sources contributed to mercury concentrations and trends. THg ranged between 44-213 mu g kg(-1) d.w. and MeHg 15-93 mu g kg(-1) d.w., representing 24-61% of THg. Values showed strong seasonal variations, with peaks in winter, due to the high biomass of predator taxa (Bythotrephes longimanus, Leptodora kindtii) and of Daphnia longispina-galeata gr. A positive correlation between THg and MeHg and delta N-15 signature was observed. D. longispina-galeata gr. prevailed in both size fractions, substantially contributing to THg and MeHg concentrations. Delta C-13 signature was strictly bound to lake thermal circulation dynamics. Mercury stock in the zooplankton compartment ranged between 19-140 ng THg m(-2) and 6-44 ng MeHg m(-2) for the >= 450 mu m size fraction and between 2-66 ng THg m(-2) and 1-7 ng MeHg m(-2) for the >= 850 mu m fraction, with the highest values in spring when zooplanktivorous fish actively prey in the pelagic zone. The results highlighted the crucial role of zooplankton as a repository of mercury, easily available to higher trophic levels.

Here we show a similar to 15,000-year quantitative precipitation history based on well-dated lake levels at Lake Chenghai, subtropical China. Lake levels and the inferred precipitation were high during the Bolling-Allerod, early and late Holocene, but low during the middle Holocene. The orbital scale precipitation trend is out of phase with boreal summer insolation, the later has been widely suggested as the driver of ASM precipitation. Lake Chenghai long-term lake levels are synchronous with trends in tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures, the related zonal sea surface temperature gradients, and interhemispheric temperature gradients. We propose that changes in either the interhemispheric or zonal Pacific temperature gradients modulate the intensity and location of the western Pacific subtropical high, which is juxtaposed on the ASM, leading to heterogeneous hydroclimatic conditions over subtropical East Asia.

This study delves into the dynamics of Kyagar Glacier surging and the associated drainage features of its Ice -dammed lake, employing high temporal resolution optical imagery. Our findings indicate that the surge on Kyagar Glacier began in late spring and early summer of 2014 and concluded during the summer of 2016. This surge resulted in the transfer of 0.321 +/- 0.012 km 3 of glacier mass from the reservoir zone to the receiving zone, leading to the formation of an ice -dammed lake at the glacier ' s terminus. The lake experienced five outbursts between 2015 and 2019, with the largest discharge occurring in 2017. And the maximum water depth during this period was 112 +/- 11 m, resulting in a water storage volume of (158.37 +/- 28.32) x 10 6 m 3 . On the other hand, our analysis of the relationship between glacier surface velocity and albedo, coupled with an examination of subglacial dynamics, revealed that increased precipitation during the active phase of the Kyagar Glacier results in accumulation of mass in the upper glacier. This accumulation induces changes in basal shear stress, triggering the glacier ' s transition into an unstable state. Consequently, glacier deformation rates escalate, surface crevasses proliferate, potentially providing conduits for surface meltwater to infiltrate the glacier bed. This, in turn, leaded to elevated basal water pressure, initiating glacier sliding. Furthermore, we postulated that the repetitive drainage of Kyagar Ice -dammed lake was primarily influenced by the opening and closing of subglacial drainage pathways and variations in inflow volumes. Future endeavors necessitate rigorous field observations to enhance glacier surge simulations, deepening our comprehension of glacier surge mechanisms and mitigating the impact of associated glacial hazards.

Site-specific differences in solute fluxes were most pronounced in late summer, when water temperatures reached 40degreesC at the effluent site and solute fluxes increased dramatically. The thermal effluent site retained 65% of its annual P load, while the non-effluent site retained 92%. Relative P release (P-release normalized to inorganic carbon fluxes; RPR) data indicated that lake sediments retained P selectively (relative to C) throughout the year, except at the effluent site during late summer when stored P was released in excess of supply rates. Sulfate reduction rates were often typical of those measured in other freshwater lakes, but unusually high rates were measured at the thermal-effluent site especially in early fall and suggested higher DIC fluxes than we measured. These high rates suggest that sulfate reduction rates were overestimated and/or that most sulfide was recycled within the sediments. In any case, the highest sulfate reduction rates did not coincide with the highest P release rates. Furthermore, the total reduced inorganic sulfur content of surficial sediments did not significantly correlate to RPR, although concentrations varied widely throughout the year. Temperature was the only variable examined that significantly correlated to RPR (R-2 = 0.53, P-value = 0.017). Coupling between temperature and sediment P release was likely mediated through temperature effects on bioturbation and microbial metabolic rates.

J	Zbik, M; Pring, A				Zbik, M; Pring, A			The Myrtle Springs meteorite: A chondrite (H4) from south Australia	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA												A single stone of 52.99 g was found 30 km west of the Old Myrtle Springs homestead on the Lake Torrens Plains, (30degrees 27' 13.8" S, 137degrees 59' 24.6" E). The chondrules in the meteorite are well defined and the dark matrix consists of fine olivine and pyroxene grains. Olivine (Fa(17.2) (= 0.6)), orthopyroxcric (Fs(15.7 +/- 0.7) Wo(1.8 +/- 0.8)), clinopyroxene (Wo(22 +/- 2.0)Fs14 (+/-) 1 0), troilite and chromite are present. Radial pyroxene chondrules, porphyritic pyroxene chondrules, granular olivine-pyroxcne porphyritic and olivinc-pyroxene chondrules are abundant in the meteorite. Cryptocrystalline pyroxene chondrules and pyroxene-olivine chondrules are rare. Based on texture and mineral chemistry, the Myrtle Springs meteorite is classified as an H4 chondrite of shock stage S1-2, weathering grade W4.																			0085-5812					MAY 31	2004	128		1				33	36																WOS:000221781800004
J	Taylor, CB				Taylor, CB			Bacteriology of fresh water II The distribution and types of coliform bacteria in lakes and streams	JOURNAL OF HYGIENE												Samples of water obtained at various depths from river and stream waters were examined. Total plate counts were made on Na caseinate agar cultures incubated at 20[degree]C. Presumptive counts on probable numbers of coliform bacteria were calculated by McCrady''s tables from McConkey broth cultures showing acid and 15% gas after 48 hrs. at 37[degree]C. Increase in river flow may reduce the number of bacteria by dilution and may increase the number of organisms in a relatively unpolluted stream by washing in organic matter. In unpolluted waters the total and coliform counts tended to fluctuate with the water level. During stratification of lake waters, the coliform count from the hypolimnion was low and constant; during periods of circulation the coliform count was approx. the same at different depths. Incidence of coliform organisms was highest in summer and autumn, possibly due to the favorable effect of higher temp. on viability and proliferation. Of 288 pure cultures isolated from positive McConkey broth cultures, 66.3% were Escherichia, coli I, 5.2% E. coli II, and 14.2% were Aerobacter aerogenes I. 27% were strains which did not ferment lactose at 37[degree]C. on primary isolation. E. coli constituted a higher proportion of coliform organisms in pure than in relatively impure waters, although the actual counts were lower.																			0022-1724					JAN	1941	41	1					17	38		10.1017/S0022172400012262	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022172400012262								20475576					WOS:000200160100002
J	Burgmer, T; Hillebrand, H				Burgmer, Tanja; Hillebrand, Helmut			Temperature mean and variance alter phytoplankton biomass and biodiversity in a long-term microcosm experiment	OIKOS												Global predictions of increasing mean temperature and its variance result in concerns about the fate of biodiversity under future climatic conditions. On the local scale of interacting species, the response of diversity to warming will depend much on the change in interspecific interactions such as competition or predation. Using a phytoplankton model community, we conducted a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial long-term microcosm experiment (16 months) with an underlying seasonal temperature profile. We manipulated the mean temperature (T-mean), the temperature variance (T-var), and the presence of consumers (ciliates) and monitored treatment effects on algal biomass, species composition and species richness. Temperature effects on algal biomass depended on the seasonal development and consumer presence. Algal biomass decreased with increasing T-mean at consumer absence, but increased at consumer presence. Overall, algal biomass decreased with increasing T-var. Consumer presence reduced algal biomass from summer to winter, but then ciliates and the consumer effect disappeared. Almost all treatment combinations collapsed to monocultures after 16 months, but extinction occurred faster at higher T-mean (especially at consumer absence) and slower at consumer presence (especially at higher T-mean). Contrasting our predictions, increasing T-var reduced richness and increased extinction rate. The treatment effects on biomass and richness were not independent, as algal species richness and biomass were positively correlated. Moreover, accelerated loss of species was consistently correlated to higher temporal variability in biomass. In conclusion, altered temperature regimes strongly affected algal biomass and diversity by interdependently altering competitive and consumer interactions.

J	Burke, IT; Kemp, AES				Burke, IT; Kemp, AES			Microfabric analysis of Mn-carbonate laminae deposition and Mn-sulfide formation in the Gotland Deep, Baltic Sea	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The manganese carbonate deposits of the anoxic Littorina sediments of the Gotland Deep have been commonly related to the periodic renewal of deep water by inflowing saline water from the North Sea. The use of scanning electron microscopy-based techniques allows identification of small-scale sedimentary and geochemical features associated with Mn-carbonate laminae, which has significant implications for models of Mn-carbonate formation. Varves occurring in the Littorina sequence contain up to four laminae that may be placed in a seasonal cycle. and kutnahorite laminae occur within varves only as a winter-early spring deposit. This kutnahorite laminae seasonality is in agreement with the seasonal distribution of major Baltic inflow events recorded in historical records, and a direct causal link between inflows and kutnahorite deposition is implied. Benthic foraminifera tests are found to be heavily encrusted in kumahorite, implying that benthic recolonization during oxidation events occurs concurrently with kutnahorite formation. The relatively common occurrence of small (50 to 100 mum) hexagonal gamma-Mn-sulfide pseudomorphs, associated with 13% of kutnahorite laminae studied. is reported in Gotland Deep sediments for the first time. Although Mn-sulfide crystals are not usually preserved in the sediment, the discovery of Mn-sulfide pseudomorphs suggests that initial formation of Mn-sulfide in the Gotland Deep may occur much more commonly during the process of kutnahorite formation than previous reports of Mn-sulfide occurrence have implied.

J	Goedkoop, W; Johnson, RK				Goedkoop, W; Johnson, RK			Pelagic-benthic coupling: Profundal benthic community response to spring diatom deposition in mesotrophic Lake Erken	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Phytodetrital sedimentation, bacterial activity in sediments, and benthic macro- and meiofauna abundance were measured to calculate a carbon budget for pelagic-benthic coupling in Lake Erken. Bacterial activity in surficial sediment was limited by temperature in spring, although a significant correlation with the input of spring-bloom phytodetritus was noted. Population dynamics of benthic meiofauna during a period of increased food availability in spring were highly taxon-specific and closely correlated to feeding behavior. Abundances of ostracods and nematodes rapidly increased when phytodetritus became available in hypolimnetic water and surficial sediment, respectively. Considerable time lags (months) were found between phytodetritus deposition and population development of harpacticoid copepods and chydorids. Carbon budget calculations based on sedimentation data (traps) and surficial sediment C content showed that during spring between 1.1 and 7.2% of deposited phytodetritus is assimilated by benthic meiofauna, whereas the dominant macroinvertebrates, sedentary chironomids, assimilated between 2.4 and 6.0%. On average, between 1.9 and 12.4% of the deposited phytodetritus was mineralized by sediment bacteria. A significant negative correlation was found between abundances of benthic meiofauna and bacteria in the sediment. Chlorophyll a analysis of surficial sediment was a necessary, complementary tool to detect sedimentation that was not detected by the traditional, cylindric sediment traps.					; Johnson, Richard/P-4991-2014	Goedkoop, Willem/0000-0002-4775-5676; Johnson, Richard/0000-0001-7979-6563													0024-3590					JUN	1996	41	4					636	647		10.4319/lo.1996.41.4.0636	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1996.41.4.0636													WOS:A1996VD30600005
J	Bodensteiner, LR; Gabriel, AO				Bodensteiner, LR; Gabriel, AO			Response of mid-water common reed stands to water level variations and winter conditions in Lake Poygan, Wisconsin, USA	AQUATIC BOTANY												Because of wetland recession, common reed (Phragmites australis) stands in the Upper Winnebago Pool Lakes, Wisconsin, now mark the former outer margins of destroyed cattail (Typha spp.) marshes, occurring off shore in water up to 1.5 m deep. These mid-water common reed stands have experienced fragmentation and losses in area. This study examined the relation between changes in characteristics of common reed stands and some key environmental factors that may affect their success, especially those related to seasonal patterns in water level management and exposure to wind and severe winter temperatures. Individual patches (28-26,598 m(2)) within each common reed stand (6740-43,048 m(2)) were characterized with regard to stem densities (1-245 m(-2)) and water depths around the perimeter (0.10-1.52 m) and in the interior (0.22-1.30 m). Water-level cumulative frequency duration curves were used to quantify duration and continuity of exposure of common reed stands to various extreme water levels during 1986-1996, and we correlated these with annual percent changes in area derived from aerial photographs. Higher stem densities corresponded to larger patch size, greater historical stability, and less fragmentation. In addition, larger patches tended to be deeper, and covered a greater range of water depths. Conversely, more "ragged" patches tended to have lower maximum depths, both in the interior and on the perimeter, as well as smaller water level ranges. Overall, higher stem densities were associated with shallower water, though intermediate depths have experienced the greatest decline. Although combinations of extreme water levels and winter temperatures did not significantly predict annual changes in area of all common reed stands, these factors explained up to 75% of the variance in stands with the greatest loss. This indicates recent losses were caused by combined effects of extreme water levels and winter temperatures. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The littoral zone of polar lakes: inshore-offshore contrasts in an ice-covered High Arctic lake	ARCTIC SCIENCE												In ice-covered polar lakes, a narrow ice-free moat opens up in spring or early summer, and then persists at the edge of the lake until complete ice loss or refreezing. In this study, we analyzed the horizontal gradients in Ward Hunt Lake, located in the Canadian High Arctic, and addressed the hypothesis that the transition from its nearshore open-water moat to offshore ice-covered waters is marked by discontinuous shifts in limnological properties. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed an abrupt increase in below-ice concentrations of chlorophyll a beyond the ice margin, along with a sharp decrease in temperature and light availability and pronounced changes in benthic algal pigments and fatty acids. There were higher concentrations of rotifers and lower concentrations of viruses at the ice-free sampling sites, and contrasts in zooplankton fatty acid profiles that implied a greater importance of benthic phototrophs in their inshore diet. The observed patterns underscore the structuring role of ice cover in polar lakes. These ecosystems do not conform to the traditional definitions of littoral versus pelagic zones but instead may have distinct moat, ice-margin, and ice-covered zones. This zonation is likely to weaken with ongoing climate change.

However, their behaviors in high- altitude remote areas were still poorly constrained. Based on one year of samples from the northeast Tibetan Plateau, we investigated the status of atmospheric microplastics and their relationships with dust. The results indicated that number-based concentrations of atmospheric microplastics were 4.07 +/- 2.37 items m(-3) with the maximum in spring, while mass-based concentrations were 0.126 +/- 0.152 mu g m(-3) with the maximum in winter. Atmospheric microplastics < 50 mu m accounted for 92.9 %, with 95.4 % being fragments, emphasizing the pervasive occurrence of small-sized fragmented microplastics in the northeast Tibetan Plateau. Analysis of Lagrangian particle dispersion model combined with potential source contributions revealed that dust emission in potential source regions significantly impacted atmospheric microplastic concentrations. The threshold shear velocity of microplastics and dust exhibited similar values, supporting their co-emissions from potential source regions. Once microplastics are entrained into the airflow, the lower updraft wind speed required for micro- plastic suspension facilitates long-range atmospheric transport. This study enhanced our insights into the atmospheric microplastic sources and supported future mitigation strategies for microplastic exposure in the remote ecosystem.

Diet and prey selection by Lake Superior lake trout during spring, 1986-2001	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We describe the diet and prey selectivity of lean (Salvelinus namaycush namaycush) and siscowet lake trout (S. n. siscowet) collected during spring (April-June) from Lake Superior during 1986-2001. We estimated prey selectivity by comparing prey numerical abundance estimates from spring bottom trawl surveys and lake trout diet information in similar areas from spring gill net surveys conducted annually in Lake Superior. Rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) was the most common prey and was positively selected by both lean and siscowet lake trout throughout the study. Selection by lean lake trout for coregonine (Coregonus spp.) prey increased after 1991 and corresponded with a slight decrease in selection for rainbow smelt. Siscowet positively selected for rainbow smelt after 1998, a change that was coincident with the decrease in selection for this prey item by lean lake trout. However, diet overlap between lean and siscowet lake trout was not strong and did not change significantly over the study period. Rainbow smelt remains an important prey species for lake trout in Lake Superior despite declines in abundance.					; Hrabik, Thomas/GYA-2566-2022	Ray, Bradley A./0009-0004-6718-6468; Sitar, Shawn/0000-0002-8868-3277; 													0380-1330					MAR	2007	33	1					104	113		10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[104:DAPSBL]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[104:DAPSBL]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000245692400009

A number of long-term studies have shown that spring biological events have advanced in recent decades and that this is a response to climate change. In lentic systems, changes in phytoplankton phenology have been attributed to various directly climate-related processes including changes in the onset and duration of thermal stratification, earlier ice-break up and increased water temperature. Both indirect climatic drivers and non-climate drivers such as elevated grazing pressure and nutrient enrichment can also affect phenology. 2. This study investigated whether phenological trends in phytoplankton could be detected in a relatively short time series in a shallow, ice-free, polymictic lake with a high annual discharge and whether any such trends could be causally explained. 3. It was found that the centre of gravity of the spring chlorophyll a bloom advanced significantly by 1.6 days per year over a 15-year period. This was accompanied by a significant increase in water temperature of 0.12 degrees C per year which is high compared to published rates of change over longer time series. No direct effects of ice cover, stratification or water discharge rates could be linked to the advancement of the spring bloom. Instead, the shift in timing was attributed to an advance in the timing of the dominant spring diatom, Aulacoseira spp., instigated by a temperature-driven increase in replication rate leading to an earlier onset of silica (SiO2) limitation.

Air breathing in the Arctic: influence of temperature, hypoxia, activity and restricted air access on respiratory physiology of the Alaska blackfish Dallia pectoralis	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												The Alaska blackfish (Dallia pectoralis) is an air-breathing fish native to Alaska and the Bering Sea islands, where it inhabits lakes that are ice-covered in the winter, but enters warm and hypoxic waters in the summer to forage and reproduce. To understand the respiratory physiology of this species under these conditions and the selective pressures that maintain the ability to breathe air, we acclimated fish to 5 degrees C and 15 degrees C and used respirometry to measure: standard oxygen uptake ((M) over dot(O2)) in normoxia (19.8 kPa P-O2) and hypoxia (2.5 kPa), with and without access to air; partitioning of standard (M) over dot(O2) in normoxia and hypoxia; maximum (M) over dot(O2) and partitioning after exercise; and critical oxygen tension (P-crit). Additionally, the effects of temperature acclimation on haematocrit, haemoglobin oxygen affinity and gill morphology were assessed. Standard (M) over dot(O2) was higher, but air breathing was not increased, at 15 degrees C or after exercise at both temperatures. Fish acclimated to 5 degrees C or 1 degrees C increased air breathing to compensate and fully maintain standard (M) over dot(O2) in hypoxia. Fish were able to maintain (M) over dot(O2) through aquatic respiration when air was denied in normoxia, but when air was denied in hypoxia, standard (M) over dot(O2) was reduced by similar to 30-50%. P-crit was relatively high (5 kPa) and there were no differences in P-crit, gill morphology, haematocrit or haemoglobin oxygen affinity at the two temperatures. Therefore, Alaska blackfish depends on air breathing in hypoxia and additional mechanisms must thus be utilised to survive hypoxic submergence during the winter, such as hypoxia-induced enhancement in the capacities for carrying and binding blood oxygen, behavioural avoidance of hypoxia and suppression of metabolic rate.					; Lefevre, Sjannie/N-4993-2014; Stecyk, Jonathan/B-4530-2013; Nilsson, Goran/K-7668-2012	Damsgaard, Christian/0000-0002-5722-4246; Lefevre, Sjannie/0000-0003-0865-0561; Stecyk, Jonathan/0000-0002-0973-9472; 													0022-0949	1477-9145				DEC	2014	217	24					4387	4398		10.1242/jeb.105023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.105023								25394628					WOS:000346420200020

In this study, we analyse seismic data from 321 days recorded by five broad-band seismometers on Urumqi Glacier No. 1, Tianshan, China, to investigate the source characteristics of icequakes. We first apply a multidimensional autoregressive maximum-likelihood algorithm to detect 12 template events from 62 days of continuous waveform data. The centroid locations of the 12 template events are located using a grid-search approach. We then obtain a catalogue of 41 895 icequakes by compiling all seismic data through a template-matching method. The local magnitudes of all icequakes range between -3.3 and 0.5, with a completeness magnitude of -2.95 and Gutenberg-Richter b-value of 1.08. The particle motion and frequency contents of the 12 template events show that the dominant phases on the vertical component are Rayleigh waves at 5-40 Hz, suggesting that these icequakes were generated by near-surface crevasses. The average daily icequake number for each month and diurnal icequake variations show clear seasonal features. The icequakes may be related to growth of the surface crevasses due to additional melting water and precipitation in summer and to the thermal contraction of the ice body in winter.

However, the hydroclimate research on different time scales in these regions remains inadequate at a global scale. In this paper, the hydrological responses from global closed basins to millennial-scale and centennial-scale cold/warm events since the Last Glacial Maximum were explored. Closed-basin lake records indicate that the westerlies-dominated closed basins are generally wetter during cold events than the corresponding warm ones on the millennial and centennial scales. In contrast, the monsoon-influenced closed basins prevail wetter climates during warm events. According to the hydroclimate simulations, precipitation seasonality plays a significant role in causing above spatial-temporal patterns. There is more winter rainfall in westerlies-dominated closed basins during cold events in the Last Glacial Maximum and Little Ice Age and more summer rainfall in monsoon-influenced closed basins during warm events in the mid-Holocene and Medieval Climate Anomaly. Under modern and future global warming, the hydroclimate changes in global closed basins show more regional differentiation, resulting in wetter mid-latitude Asian and low-latitude African closed basins but drier southwest North American and Australian closed basins.

Therefore, studying the phenomenon and mechanisms behind extreme rainfall changes in this region is of great significance for economic and social development. In this study, we present high-resolution pollen and grain-size records from the Shanglin Lake located in Zhejiang, eastern China, based which changes in the frequency of paleo-flood events were reconstructed and the climatic context was inferred. Our pollen records show that the content of evergreen broadleaf trees gradually increased during 8000-7000 cal. yr BP, reflecting the gradually increasing temperature in the growing season. The content of Altingia increased substantially during the periods of 7960-7860, 7600-7500, and 7200-7100 cal. yr BP, especially in the first and last periods, indicating the prevalence of an El Nin similar to o-like condition in the study area during the early mid-Holocene warm period. Grain-size record shows that the prolonged El Nin similar to o condition facilitated a significant increase in flood frequency. Our results suggest that, similar to that of today, the early mid-Holocene warm climate was the most important factor controlling extreme hydroclimatic changes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.

The lithium isotope system, a sensitive geochemical tracer, can be used to track a wide range of geological processes and sources. This study investigates major cations, [Li], and delta Li-7 of samples (brine lakes, intercrystalline brines, river waters, rain, hot spring waters, spring waters and rocks) from the Qaidam Basin on the northern Tibetan Plateau, China. [Li] values vary from less than 0.01 mg L-1 to similar to 408.83 mg L-1. There are significant differences in [Li] for different sample types. spring water (rain) < river samples < brine lakes < intercrystalline brines. The delta Li-7 values of samples display as significant variations as [Li], ranging from 4.33 parts per thousand to +40.66 parts per thousand. There are also significant differences in delta Li-7 for different sample types. The delta Li-7 values of spring water and river waters are relatively low and the values are from 4.33 parts per thousand to 18.37 parts per thousand. However, intercrystalline brines and saline lakes have the higher values, and the heaviest delta Li-7 (+40.66 parts per thousand) occurs in Chaka Lake. The delta Li-7 values in brine lakes in the Qaidam Basin show obvious regional distributions, which are also consistent with the structural characteristics of the Qaidam Basin. The possible sources of lithium in the brine lakes of the Qaidam Basin result from multiple mixing of redissolved Li from earlier salt sediments, deep groundwater via fractures (oil field brines, hot springs, etc.), low-temperature weathering processes of Li-rich rock, and freshwater. The results suggest that delta Li-7 should be a powerful tracer to unravel the sources of Li and reconstruct its accumulation processes in brine lakes. This study provides important theoretical and practical guidance for the effective protection of precious lithium brine deposits and sustainable lithium resource exploration.					; he, maoyong/ADO-7723-2022; Deng, Li/AAQ-8310-2020; Li, YuLong/LPQ-7125-2024; Yang, Kaiyuan/T-7575-2017; Zhang, Xiying/E-9474-2014	Kong, Fancui/0000-0002-6470-9698; 													0169-1368	1872-7360				FEB	2020	117								103277	10.1016/j.oregeorev.2019.103277	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.oregeorev.2019.103277													WOS:000515206900042

However, Cooper's hawks had significantly higher total white blood cell counts and higher concentrations of heterophils, monocytes, and eosinophils. Proportionally, lymphocytes made up a smaller percentage of the differential count in the Cooper's hawk. Eosinophil concentrations and percentages of the differential count were significantly higher in the females of both species. Both species had a high prevalence of Leucocytozoon toddi and Haemoproteus spp, infection. Haemoproteus nisi and H. elani were identified in both hawks. Trypanosoma avium was identified in a single Cooper's hawk and Plasmodium circumflexum was identified in a sharp-shinned hawk. Prevalence of Leucocytozoon toddi and Haemoproteus spp. infections were significantly higher in the birds caught late in the spring as compared to those caught earlier in the spring; this was evidence for a spring recrudescence of patent parasite infections.																			0090-3558					APR	1995	31	2					216	222		10.7589/0090-3558-31.2.216	http://dx.doi.org/10.7589/0090-3558-31.2.216								8583640					WOS:A1995QU26700014

Since zebra mussel invaded Lake Constance in the 1960s the number of wintering waterbirds increased fourfold. We studied the impact of predation by waterbirds (tufted duck Aythya fuligula, pochard Aythya ferina and coot Fulica atra) on the population of Dreissena polymorpha in winter 2001/2002. These three species, with monthly peak numbers of approximately 230 000 individuals, currently comprise up to 80% of the waterbird population wintering at Lake Constance. 2. Four different study sites and four depths, that represent typical and characteristic habitats of mussels in Upper Lake Constance, were chosen. 3. Zebra mussels were sampled before, during and after predation by waterbirds. Their biomass in shallow areas decreased by > 90%; the biomass reduction in deeper areas was highly variable and dependent on the substratum. With one exception, no changes could be detected at the greatest depth (11 m). 4. Concurrent exclosure studies revealed that the decrease in zebra mussels was caused by waterbird predation. A GIS-based approximation revealed that in an area of 1 km(2) a total of approximately 750 t mussel fresh mass was removed by birds, which is equivalent to 1390 g mussels per bird per day. 5. Wintering waterbirds have a strong structural impact on the littoral community of Lake Constance and could be the key predator of zebra mussels.																			0046-5070					AUG	2005	50	8					1412	1426		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01411.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01411.x													WOS:000230576500011
J	Hosny, S; Labib, W				Hosny, Shimaa; Labib, Wagdy			Co-varying Environmental Conditions Control the Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Microcystis aeruginosa and Botryococcus braunii in a Freshwater Ecosystem	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												NOZHA lake (South of Alexandria City, Egypt), an artificial freshwater basin, receives its water supply from the Nile River and from the surrounded urban area, which affect the ecological balance. Results during a year cycle (December 2017 to November 2018) revealed scums and dispersive blooms of Microcystis aeruginosa Kutzing (Cyanophyta) and Botryococcus braunii Kutzing (Chlorophyta), in no particular season, under a wide range of environmental conditions. Microcystis aeruginosa was a persistent form during the whole period, culminating in visible blooms in December, June, and September. The distinctive role of temperature was evidenced during the transient periods in spring and summer. The inorganic dissolved nitrate, ammonia, and phosphate might affect the variability in the community structure and abundance. Stoichiometric analyses indicated major potential nitrogen limitation (63.89% of the total observations), whereas 15.28% of the total observations were P limiting, and 20.83% of the total observations were either N or P limiting. Hence, the reduction of only one type of nutrients can lead to an imbalance in the ratio. The major bloom peaks of M. aeruginosa and B. braunii detected in June and September raised chlorophyll a content to its extreme values (16.5 and 21.8mg L-1, respectively). The blooms of B. braunii influenced the accompanied phytoplankton species diversity with different degrees to explain the interaction with eutrophic fast-growing Chlorella vulgaris green algae.																			0375-9237	2357-0350				MAY	2022	62	2					431	441		10.21608/ejbo.2022.93159.1769	http://dx.doi.org/10.21608/ejbo.2022.93159.1769													WOS:000796028000009

The models implemented in this study include a spatial submodel to account for spatial and temporal characteristics of fish exposure and a probabilistic adaptation of the Gobas bioaccumulation model to account for temporal variation in concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in sediment and water. We estimated the geographic distribution of an offshore winter flounder subpopulation based on species biology, including such variables as foraging area, habitat size, disposal site size and migration characteristics. We incorporated these variables together with an estimate of differential attraction to a management site within a spatially explicit model to assess the range of expected PCB exposures to a winter flounder population. The output of this modeling effort, flounder PCB tissue concentrations, provides exposure point concentrations for estimates of human health risk through ingestion of locally caught flounder. The risks obtained for the spatially non-explicit case are as much as one order of magnitude higher than those obtained after incorporating spatial and temporal characteristics of winter flounder foraging and seasonal migration. Incorporating spatial and temporal variables in food chain models can help support sediment management decisions by providing a quantitative expression of the confidence in risk estimates.

J	Kokfelt, U; Muscheler, R				Kokfelt, U.; Muscheler, R.			Solar forcing of climate during the last millennium recorded in lake sediments from northern Sweden	HOLOCENE												We report on a sediment record from a small lake within the subarctic wetland complex Stordalen in northernmost Sweden covering the last 1000 years. Variations in the content of minerogenic material are found to follow reconstructed variations in the activity of the Sun between the 13th and 18th centuries. Periods of low solar activity are associated with minima in minerogenic material and vice versa. A comparison between the sunspot cycle and a long instrumental series of summer precipitation further reveals a link between the 11 yr solar cycle and summer precipitation variability since around 1960. Solar minima are in this period associated with minima in summer precipitation, whereas the amount of summer precipitation increases during periods with higher solar activity. Our results suggest that the climate responds to both the 11 yr solar cycle and to long-term changes in solar activity and in particular solar minima, causing dry conditions with resulting decreased runoff.

HABITAT UTILIZATION AND WINTER TIME-ACTIVITY BUDGETS OF THE WHOOPER SWAN CYGNUS CYGNUS (LINNAEUS, 1758) POPULATION WINTERING AT THE VAN LAKE BASIN, TURKEY	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												In this study, daily behaviour patterns of whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus) were studied at the Van Lake Basin, which is one of the most important wintering areas of the species in Turkey. Winter-time activities of the swans were monitored from sunrise to sunset in 6 different categories: resting, feeding, preening, walking on land, swimming and flying. The most common daytime activity was resting (55%). Feeding (12.48%) and preening (10.98%) were the two other main diurnal activities of whooper swans during the present study. Resting peaked in midday period (08:30-13:30) while feeding was observed frequently in early morning hours (06:00-8:30) and late afternoon (13:30-17:00). At the beginning of severe winter period (December and January) whooper swans clearly reduced feeding time in all parts of the day, probably because they still met metabolic demands. A significant increase in feeding behaviour was observed in January and February when they were preparing to migrate. While open water surface was the most preferred area for resting, shallow coastal areas and reeds were the most utilized foraging habitats.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2019	17	2					2179	2185		10.15666/aeer/1702_21792185	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1702_21792185													WOS:000462830400047

However, the direct effects of insolation variation on long-term wildfire activity as a function of Milankovitch cycles have not been investigated yet. In central Japan, charcoal records in lake sediments indicate that long-term wildfire activity may be determined by spring insolation. Thus, in this study, we used a fuel moisture model to simulate high fire risk scenarios (i.e., hours with low fuel moisture) in spring based on maximum and minimum spring insolation periods since the last interglacial period. Our simulation results demonstrated that the duration of high fire risk under maximum spring insolation period is 10-60% longer than that in the minimum spring insolation period, although the duration depends on vegetation conditions. We conclude that orbital-insolation variation can directly influence the long-term wildfire activity via changes in evaporation rate arising from fuel or forest litter.

Cladocera are present in a long core WZS/ 03 (Slupianska Bay), and a surface sediments. The sediment contains remains of twenty-seven species belonging to 5 families. Species composition of plankton and the variability in the frequency of specimens of Cladocera made possible to distinguish five phases of their development, which well correlated with palynological phases. The correlation proves that the biological development of Wigry Lake was determined mainly by climatic changes. During the history of the lake, planktonic forms were dominant and represented by Bosminidae. It indicates that the lake was (excluding the initial part) deep and oligo-or mesotrophic. The mesotrophic state has been noted during the Atlantic chronozone and temporary. Taking into consideration the size and the depth as well as the rare human population around the lake it can be stated that the trophy rise was the result of the warm climate. It is also possible that during the last few decades the natural and anthropogenic factors could add. Probably mild winters, warm and long summers, increased tourists number were partly responsible for changes of water state.

Frequency and intensity of palaeofloods at the interface of Atlantic and Mediterranean climate domains	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												The long-term response of the flood activity to both Atlantic and Mediterranean climatic influences was explored by studying a lake sequence (Lake Foreant) of the Western European Alps. High-resolution sedimentological and geochemical analysis revealed 171 event layers, 168 of which result from past flood events over the last millennium. The layer thickness was used as a proxy of intensity of past floods. Because the Foreant palaeoflood record is in agreement with the documented variability of historical floods resulting from local and mesoscale, summer-to-autumn convective events, it is assumed to highlight changes in flood frequency and intensity related to such events typical of both Atlantic (local events) and Mediterranean (mesoscale events) climatic influences. Comparing the Foreant record with other Atlantic-influenced and Mediterranean-influenced regional flood records highlights a common feature in all flood patterns that is a higher flood frequency during the cold period of the Little Ice Age (LIA, AD 1300-1900). In contrast, high-intensity flood events are apparent during both the cold LIA and the warm Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA, AD 9501250). However, there is a tendency towards higher frequencies of high-intensity flood events during the warm MCA. The MCA extremes could mean that under the global warming scenario, we might see an increase in intensity (not in frequency). However, the flood frequency and intensity in the course of the 20th century warming trend did not change significantly. Uncertainties in future evolution of flood intensity lie in the interpretation of the lack of 20th century extremes (transition or stable?) and the different climate forcing factors between the two periods (greenhouse gases vs. solar and/or volcanic eruptions).					; Crouzet, Christian/O-6410-2019; Vogel, Hendrik/C-6148-2014; Wilhelm, Bruno/B-9265-2013; Etienne, David/A-7675-2013; Crouzet, Christian/F-6447-2011	Anselmetti, Flavio/0000-0002-8785-3641; Vogel, Hendrik/0000-0002-9902-8120; Etienne, David/0000-0001-6388-7241; Crouzet, Christian/0000-0002-4138-5213													1814-9324	1814-9332					2016	12	2					299	316		10.5194/cp-12-299-2016	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-299-2016													WOS:000371625400008
J	SPATARU, P; GOPHEN, M				SPATARU, P; GOPHEN, M			FEEDING-BEHAVIOR OF SILVER CARP HYPOPHTHALMICHTHYS-MOLITRIX VAL AND ITS IMPACT ON THE FOOD WEB IN LAKE KINNERET, ISRAEL	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Silver carp, H. molitrix Val., have been stocked in Lake Kinneret, Israel, since 1969. From 1972-1981, 11 .times. 106 fingerlings were introduced into the lake. Total silver carp catch was only 642 during this period, resulting in a progressive increase in the silver carp population. Silver carp feed mostly on phytoplankton from Feb.-Aug. From Sept.-Jan. sampled gut contents contained predominantly zooplankton. Indices of electrivity for zooplankton were positive from Sept.-Dec., negative during Jan.-Aug. and vice versa for phytoplankton. Predation pressure of planktivorous fish on zooplankton in Lake Kinneret has been intensified recently. Accumulation of silver carp in the lake probably supported this process. Silver carp compete with commercially valuable native fish species by feeding on the same zooplankton resources during summer and fall. Additionally, the grazing population of microcrustaceans is reduced at the time it is needed to prevent microalge blooms. Market demands for silver carp are low, catchability of this fish is poor and it can be cultured efficiently in ponds. Consequently it is recommended that the stocking of silver carp in Lake Kinneret be stopped.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1985	120	1					53	61		10.1007/BF00034590	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00034590													WOS:A1985ABB4900006

Can pelagic forage fish and spawning cisco (Coregonus artedi) biomass in the western arm of Lake Superior be assessed with a single summer survey?	FISHERIES RESEARCH					Conference on Fish Stock Assessment Methods for Lakes and Reservoirs - Toward the True Picture of Fish Stock	SEP, 2007	Ceske Budejovice, CZECH REPUBLIC					Management efforts to rehabilitate lake trout Salvelinus nomaycush in Lake Superior have been successful and the recent increase in their numbers has led to interest in measuring biomass of pelagic prey fish species important to these predators. Lake Superior cisco Coregonus artedi currently support roe fisheries and determining the sustainability of these fisheries is an important management issue. We conducted acoustic and midwater trawl surveys of the western arm of Lake Superior during three periods: summer Uuly-August), October, and November 2006 to determine if a single survey can be timed to estimate biomass of both prey fish and spawning cisco. We evaluated our methods by comparing observed trawl catches of small (<250 mm total length) and large fish to expected trawl catches based on acoustic densities in the trawl path. We found the relationship between observed and expected catches approached unity over a wide range of densities, suggesting that our acoustic method provided reasonable estimates of fish density, and that midwater trawling methods were free of species- and size-selectivity issues. Rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax was by number the most common species captured in the nearshore (<80 m bathymetric depth) stratum during all three surveys, while kiyi Coregonus kiyi was predominant offshore except during November. Total biomass estimates of rainbow smelt in the western arm were similar during all three surveys, while total biomass of kiyi was similar between summer and October, but was lower in November. Total biomass of large cisco increased substantially in November, while small bloater Coregonus hoyi biomass was lower. We compared our summer 2006 estimates of total fish biomass to the results of a summer survey in 1997 and obtained similar results. We conclude that the temporal window for obtaining biomass estimates of pelagic prey species in the western arm of Lake Superior is wide (July through October), but estimating spawning cisco abundance is best done with a November survey.

Water and energy exchange in East Siberian forest: A synthesis	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												This paper summarizes and synthesises the results obtained in several recent studies on water and energy exchange of East Siberian forests located on permafrost. It is found that annual evaporation of these forests shows relatively small inter-annual variation (147196 mm). The availability of stored water in the permafrost probably functions as a buffering resource that is only used occasionally in very dry years. Surface soil water content shows a 1-year memory to precipitation in Eastern Siberia because the precipitation conditions in previous summers carry over in a frozen condition to the next spring. Modelling shows that evaporation was larger for southern forests than for northern forests. Compared to tundra, taiga forest shows a relatively small Bowen ratio. In an alas system, observations show considerable impact of the distribution of lakes in the vicinity on the observed evaporation fluxes. There appeared to be little difference in the observed Bowen ratio between a young and old larch forest. Surface conductance modelling and upscaling studies note that leaf area index (LAI) was a controlling factor in evaporation. With the permafrost area under strong pressure from climate warming, the need to understand the ecophysiological controls of these forests in East Siberia is paramount. With the data and analysis presented in this special issue becoming available we are now in a better position to model the effects of permafrost degradation on water and energy balances.

J	Lawrence, GA; Burke, JM; Murphy, TP; Prepas, EE				Lawrence, GA; Burke, JM; Murphy, TP; Prepas, EE			Exchange of water and oxygen between the two basins of Amisk Lake	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Amisk Lake was artificially oxygenated year-round by bubbling oxygen through a diffuser installed at the deepest point of its north basin. The hypolimnion of both basins became anoxic in summer before operation of the system whereas anoxia was never observed while it was fully operational (July 1990 until October 1993). The system increased the average hypolimnetic oxygen content of the south basin by an average of 83 tonnes (t) more than under natural conditions between 2 September and 18 May. This considerable increase is approximately accounted for by the transport of dissolved oxygen (DO) through the connecting channel by currents driven by the bubble plume (approximate to 52 t) and by internal seiche pumping (approximate to 17 t): both mechanisms are contingent on the thermocline depth being less than that of the connecting channel. Internal seiche pumping was possible because the connecting channel is shorter than the maximum distance across which hypolimnetic fluid moved between flow reversals. Other factors that may have been important include changes in the replenishment of DO during turnover, oxygen transfer during winter through the ice-free patch created by the bubble plume, and an increase in DO consumption.

JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Sediment cores spanning the last two centuries were taken in Hagelseewli, a high-elevation lake in the Swiss Alps. Contiguous 0.5 cm samples were analysed for biological remains, including diatoms, chironomids, cladocera, chrysophyte cysts, and fossil pigments. In addition, sedimentological and geochemical variables such as loss-on-ignition, total carbon, nitrogen, sulphur, grain-size and magnetic mineralogy were determined. The results of these analyses were compared to a long instrumental air temperature record that was adapted to the elevation of Hagelseewli by applying mean monthly lapse rates. During much of the time, the lake is in the shadow of a high cliff to the south, so that the lake is ice-covered during much of the year and thus decoupled from climatic forcing. Lake biology is therefore influenced more by the duration of ice-cover than by direct temperature effects during the short open-water season. Long periods of ice-cover result in anoxic water conditions and dissolution of authigenic calcites, leading to carbonate-free sediments. The diversity of chironomid and cladoceran assemblages is extremely low, whereas that of diatom and chrysophyte cyst assemblages is much higher. Weak correlations were observed between the diatom and chrysophyte cyst assemblages on the one hand and summer or autumn air temperatures on the other, but the proportion of variance explained is low, so that air temperature alone cannot account for the degree of variation observed in the paleolimnological record. Analyses of mineral magnetic parameters, spheroidal carbonaceous particles and lead suggest that atmospheric pollution has had a significant effect on the sediments of Hagelseewli, but little effect on the water quality as reflected in the lake biota.

Macrophyte influence on the structure and productivity of photosynthetic picoplankton in wetlands	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												We used multiple approaches to analyze photosynthetic picoplankton (PPP) structure and production in a wetland in the Lower Parana Basin (Argentina). A seasonal field survey was combined with an experimental study to analyze PPP variability under different light conditions. Flow cytometry analyses showed differences in PPP structure among the aquatic environments. Three main picoplankton populations were distinguished: phycocyanin-rich picocyanobacteria (Pcy), picoeukaryote (Peuk) and anaerobic anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria (AnAnPB). The experimental study revealed important changes in PPP structure in relation to the light conditions imposed by floating plants: enclosures exposed to light showed a higher proportion of Peuk and Pcy over AnAnPB; in mesocosms covered by plants, just as in the highly vegetated relict lakes (ROLs), AnAnPB were dominant. Total picophytoplankton abundances varied from 1.7 x 10(4) to 4.6 x 10(5) cells mL(-1) in the shallow lakes, and were lower (0.69 x 10(4) to 2.5 x 10(5) cells mL(-1)) in the ROLs. Annual variations in temperature and hydrological conditions influenced the PPP abundances, observing maximum values during the warm dry phase. The photosynthetic rates per unit area of PPP (P-APPP) and algae > 3 mu m (P-A > 3 mu m) were measured in the aquatic environments in winter and summer: P-A PPP (1.5 to 100 mg C m(-2)h(-1)) was lower than P-A > 3 mu m and was directly affected by light, which was limiting under the dense floating plant cover.

J	OHanlon, RP; Bolger, T				OHanlon, RP; Bolger, T			Biomass, growth, and secondary production of Arcitalitrus dorrieni (Crustacea: Amphipoda: Talitridae) at two sites in Co Galway, Ireland	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Growth rates, podomere addition, and secondary production of Arcitalitrus dorrieni (Hunt, 1925) populations inhabiting two neighbouring woodland sites at Kylemore, Co. Galway, Ireland, were investigated. One site was a mixed deciduous woodland infested with Rhododendron ponticum. The Other a pure coniferous stand of Pinus contorta var. latifolia S. Wats. Seasonal changes in biomass were recorded at the two sires. In both years of the study, maximum biomass was recorded in September. Females had a higher growth rate than males, but growth rates of both males and females were higher at the mixed deciduous site. The number of podomeres on the second antenna was correlated with the size of the animal. The average length of A. dorrieni at each podomere number appeared to change seasonally. Comparisons of mean spring values with mean summer values showed a statistically significant decrease in mean amphipod length for a given podomere number, though this was more marked at the mixed deciduous site. Annual secondary production rates ranged from 5.06 g dry wt m(-2)year(-1) at the coniferous site to 14.55 g dry wt m(-2)year(-1) at the mixed deciduous site-P:B values ranged from 2.41 at the coniferous site to 3.01 at the mixed deciduous site. Results are compared between sites and with data from other relevant crustacean species.

In this study, an empirical algorithm was developed based on a band ratio (555 nm/645 nm) of atmospherically corrected surface reflectance of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer(MODIS), using 1215 in-situ samples to estimate particulate composition (Organic Suspended Matter/Total Suspended Matter, OSM/TSM). The study further explored the intra-annual and inter-annual variability of OSM/TSM using General Linear Model(GLM) and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), and examined its linkages by analyzing the covariation between OSM/TSM and submerged vegetation (SV) in Erhai from 2000 to 2024. New hydrological insights: The OSM/TSM algorithm demonstrated satisfactory performance (R2=0.71, RMSE=0.14, UMAPE= 31.23 %). Results showed that Urban lakes exhibited 1.3 times higher annual mean OSM/TSM than natural lakes, with all lakes exhibiting consistent seasonal peaks during the summer and autumn. A weak but consistent long-term declining trend in OSM/ TSM (-0.003 yr-1) was observed across most lakes, except for Dianchi and Yangzonghai. GLM analysis revealed that wind speed was the dominant factor driving intra-annual OSM/TSM variability, accounting for 45.58 +/- 15.94 %. PLS-SEM results indicated that climate factors were the primary inter-annual driving in natural and semi-urban lakes, while human activity, such as lake expansion and nighttime light, dominated in urban lakes. OSM/TSM was shown to be a potential influencing factor for the growth of submerged vegetation.

J	Lei, T; Li, SL; Luo, FF; Liu, N				Lei, Ting; Li, Shuanglin; Luo, Feifei; Liu, Na			Two dominant factors governing the decadal cooling anomalies in winter in East China during the global hiatus period	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Observational analyses reveal substantial cooling anomalies in East China, during the global hiatus period (1998-2013), particularly in winter. The factors contributing to the winter cooling anomalies and the underlying mechanisms are studied. The results highlight the substantial roles played by two factors: Arctic sea ice reduction (i.e., sea ice area in Barents-Kara Seas, SIA) and the sea surface temperature (SST) cooling anomalies in the Kuroshio extension region (KSST). Together, these factors contribute to approximate 90% of the trend anomaly of East China's area averaged surface air temperature (ECT). The individual contributions from SIA and KSST are investigated based on observational diagnostic analyses and sensitivity experiments. The results show that the contributions from the two factors are similar. Both SIA and KSST induce intensified geopotential height over the mid-to-high latitudes of the Eurasian continent, with the maximum over the Ural Mountains extending toward Lake Baikal. These anomalies intensify the Ural blocking activities and Mongolian cold high. Meanwhile, both forcings cause negative 500-hPa geopotential height (Z500) anomalies over the central North Pacific that extends westward to East Asia, intensifying the climatological East Asian grand trough. However, KSST causes positive Z500 anomalies over the Bering Sea, but SIA does not. The enhanced Ural blocking activities and the deepened East Asian grand trough jointly favour the intensification of the East Asian winter monsoon, thus causing cooling anomalies in East China.

J	Wang, RX; Yang, XJ				Wang, Rong-Xing; Yang, Xiao-Jun			Waterbird Composition and Changes With Wetland Park Construction at Lake Dianchi, Yunnan Guizhou Plateau	MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT												Establishing effectively protected and managed ecosystems with high biodiversity is the broad aim of the Aichi initiative. Assessing the biodiversity of a specific ecosystem is the first step in estimating its conservation value. Most lakes on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau are formed by mountain faulting and are surrounded by human settlements. Lake ecosystems are fragile and frequently disturbed by pollution, agricultural activities, and tourism. The current lakeside wetland parks are intended to abate pollution and promote tourism. However, the composition of the monthly and yearly waterbird population and the impacts of the parks on waterbirds are unclear. Using direct observation and spot map census methods, we conducted 104 field surveys across 4 consecutive years at Lake Dianchi to fill the gaps in current knowledge. The results showed that Dianchi could provide habitats for more than 60,000 individual birds of 105 species, including residents, summer visitors, migrants, and winter visitors. The current oxidation ponds in wetland parks, created for water purification and tourism, were not suitable for most shorebirds. Consequently, we suggest that plans for the construction of artificial wetlands or wetland parks in this region should consider the habitat requirements of different waterbirds in different seasons. Particular attention should be given to protecting the marshlands and mud flats that wading birds require. We also suggest that increased waterbird monitoring in different seasons across different years is needed around Lake Dianchi and other wetlands on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau for effective conservation.

J	Tas, B				Tas, Beyhan			Bloom and eutrophication of Hydrodictyon reticulatum (Chlorophyceae) at Civil and Kacali Stream, Ordu, Turkey	ENERGY EDUCATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PART A-ENERGY SCIENCE AND RESEARCH												Civil and Kacali streams are one of the most important streams of Ordu city. However, there were too much pollution in down parts of these streams due to environmental vastes, coming from sewages and agricultural activities. When water flow decreased in dry seasons, eutrophication was observed following water blooms in these streams. Extreme eutrophications occurred in Civil and Kacali streams at the end of spring and early summer in 2009. Because of excessive algal blooms, dense green masses covered a large portion of the stream surfaces in the study term. In the examination of both the stream, Hydrodictyon reticulatum (Linnaeus) Bory de Saint-Vincent (water net) from the filamentous green algae let to excessive water blooms. This alga is a species that reduces oxygen level and disrupts the appearance in this types of watfers where are stagnant and shallow. Dissolved oxygen was determined as 4.76 mg/L in Civil Stream and 7.23 mg/L Kacali Stream in blooming time. In during eutrophication, sampling was made from the two streams and some physico-chemical and biological properties were examined. Results of analysis were compared with standards of the Turkish Water Pollution Control Regulation (WPCR). Phosphorous which is the important nutrient and causes water bloom was found at high ratio in the stream waters. In terms of these parameters, the streams have water quality at fourth category. It was determined that Civil Stream was much more polluted than Kacali Stream.					Taş, Beyhan/ABT-1207-2022														1308-772X					OCT	2011	28	1					319	330																WOS:000291125500033

In order to find ways for eutrophication control, a comparative study was conducted on three landscape water bodies, namely Qingjing Lake, Jiyun River and Jiyun River Oxbow, which are under varied conditions of salinity, organic, and nutrients intrusion. The spatial and temporal variations of water quality were revealed by water sampling and analyses, and correlative relationships were obtained between water salinity and other parameters related to eutrophication. By utilizing a trophic level index (TLI), the eutrophication status of the three landscape water bodies in different seasons could further be evaluated. As a result, water temperature, as expected, showed the strongest effect on eutrophication because higher TLI together with higher Chl-a concentrations tended to occur in later spring and summer seasons, while nutrient concentration, especially TP, was also the determinative factor to the eutrophication status. Of the three water bodies, the Jiyun River Oxbow showed a salinity as high as 20 g/L or more in contrast with the other two water bodies with salinity as 4-5 g/L. Although its TP concentration was usually very low (about 0.1 mg/L), it was under a moderate eutrophication status almost in all seasons, indicating that high salinity tends to induce alga growth. Dilution of saline inflow and nutrients reduction could thus be proposed as the main measures for eutrophication control of landscape waters in the study area. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The GCR-IHC is an important wintering area for lesser scaup in northwestern Indiana, especially after Lake Michigan freezes, because of the lack of other wildlife habitat in the area. We investigated the feeding and movement patterns of these wintering lesser scaup to better understand the ecological significance of this area to wintering waterfowl and to interpret contaminant levels in these lesser scaup. We implanted radio transmitters in 20 individuals in January 1994 and tracked them until early March 1994. Four lesser scaup disappeared and four died within the first 2 weeks after implantation; 12 lesser scaup remained in the GCR-IHC for the next 6-7 weeks. Individual radio-marked scaup (n = 12) were located in the GCR-IHC on an average of 62.2% (extreme values = 25-87%) of the searches. No radio-marked lesser scaup were located outside the GCR-IHC. Lesser scaup were feeding during 23% of the radio fixes.

RECONSTRUCTING PALEOCATCHMENTS BY INTEGRATING STABLE ISOTOPE RECORDS, SEDIMENTOLOGY, AND TAPHONOMY: A LATE CRETACEOUS CASE STUDY (MONTANA, UNITED STATES)	PALAIOS												Robust isotopic reconstructions of climate, elevation, and biology require a reasonable capture of the range of isotopic variability across a paleolandscape. Here, we illustrate how integrating multiple proxies derived from a variety of paleoenvironments aids in this effort. We determined delta O-18 and delta C-13 values from lake and soil carbonates, unionid shells, gar scales, and crocodile teeth from multiple depositional environments (lakes, soils, ponds, streams, and large rivers) spanning a 300 km proximal-to-distal transect within the Late Cretaceous foreland basin of Montana. Two major patterns emerge. First, quiet water environments display higher delta O-18 and lower delta C-13 values than large rivers, which indicates greater input from local precipitation compared to high-altitude runoff, and a relatively larger contribution of degraded vegetative matter to the dissolved inorganic carbon load. Second, proxies with seasonal biases toward late spring and summer growth display lower delta O-18 and delta C-13 values in the basin proximal setting compared to the distal coastal setting, which is linked to the rainout history of vapor masses moving across the foreland basin. Overall these isotopic patterns mirror those in modern catchments, support hypotheses of monsoonal rainfall within the basin, and suggest a hypsometric mean elevation of similar to 2.6 km within the Sevier orogenic belt. Furthermore, our results indicate a potential to subdivide freshwater paleoecosystems to refine paleobiologic studies of habitat preference and migration patterns.

Spring migration patterns of red knots in the Southeast United States disentangled using automated telemetry	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Red Knots use the Southeast United States as a stopover during north and southbound migration and during the winter. We examined northbound red knot migration routes and timing using an automated telemetry network. Our primary goal was to evaluate the relative use of an Atlantic migratory route through Delaware Bay versus an inland route through the Great Lakes en route to Arctic breeding grounds and to identify areas of apparent stopovers. Secondarily, we explored the association of red knot routes and ground speeds with prevailing atmospheric conditions. Most Red Knots migrating north from the Southeast United States skipped or likely skipped Delaware Bay (73%) while 27% of the knots stopped in Delaware Bay for at least 1 day. A few knots used an Atlantic Coast strategy that did not include Delaware Bay, relying instead on the areas around Chesapeake Bay or New York Bay for stopovers. Nearly 80% of migratory trajectories were associated with tailwinds at departure. Most knots tracked in our study traveled north through the eastern Great Lake Basin, without stopping, thus making the Southeast United States the last terminal stopover for some knots before reaching boreal or Arctic stopover sites.					; Smith, Adam/F-9828-2011	Handmaker, Maina/0009-0009-5964-4496; Smith, Adam/0000-0002-4863-2395													2045-2322					JUL 10	2023	13	1							11138	10.1038/s41598-023-37517-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-37517-y								37429880					WOS:001027101700037

The lake ecosystem is the important carbon storeroom in the earth, it absorbs a mass of carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, and transforms carbon dioxide to organically carbon, and then the lake has traits of abundant carbon reserves and heavy carbon density. As the especial geographical place and upper productivity, the lake has significant role in carbon circle. By now, there is clear acquaintanceship of greenhouse effect problem, especial we have qualitative and quantificational understanding of ocean carbon circle primary. But we have a little research of lake carbon circle and carbon flux. There are many lakes in China, so it is crucial meaning to study lake carbon circle. In this paper, the improved Static Chamber and Li8100 that used to monitor soil Carbon Flux are introduced. Through continuously monitoring from July to November 2010, in northern Grass-type Lake-Baiyangdian demonstration, a series of conclusion are concluded about lake Carbon Flux : the day-variation of Carbon Fluxes chenged significantly, and varying followed time and temperature, the highest Carbon Flux is consistent to the highest temperature; the rule of day-variation is similar to aforesaid the three months(except special days), but Carbon Fluxes are not same, August>October> November.

Wide distribution of autochthonous branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (bGDGTs) in US Great Basin hot springs	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (bGDGTs) are membrane-spanning lipids that likely stabilize membranes of some bacteria. Although bGDGTs have been reported previously in certain geothermal environments, it has been suggested that they may derive from surrounding soils since bGDGTs are known to be produced by soil bacteria. To test the hypothesis that bGDGTs can be produced by thermophiles in geothermal environments, we examined the distribution and abundance of bGDGTs, along with extensive geochemical data, in 40 sediment and mat samples collected from geothermal systems in the U.S. Great Basin (temperature: 31-95 degrees C; pH: 6.8-10.7). bGDGTs were found in 38 out of 40 samples at concentrations up to 824 ng/g sample dry mass and comprised up to 99.5% of total GDGTs (branched plus isoprenoidal). The wide distribution of bGDGTs in hot springs, strong correlation between core and polar lipid abundances, distinctness of bGDGT profiles compared to nearby soils, and higher concentration of bGDGTs in hot springs compared to nearby soils provided evidence of in situ production, particularly for the minimally methylated bGDGTs I, Ib, and Ic. Polar bGDGTs were found almost exclusively in samples <= 70 degrees C and the absolute abundance of polar bGDGTs correlated negatively with properties of chemically reduced, high temperature spring sources (temperature, H2S/HS-) and positively with properties of oxygenated, low temperature sites (O-2, NO3-). Two-way cluster analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling based on relative abundance of polar bGDGTs supported these relationships and showed a negative relationship between the degree of methylation and temperature, suggesting a higher abundance for minimally methylated bGDGTs at high temperature. This study presents evidence of the widespread production of bGDGTs in mats and sediments of natural geothermal springs in the U.S. Great Basin, especially in oxygenated, low-temperature sites (<= 70 degrees C).

J	Rösel, S; Grossart, HP				Roesel, Stefan; Grossart, Hans-Peter			Contrasting dynamics in activity and community composition of free-living and particle-associated bacteria in spring	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Phytoplankton development affects the community structure and dynamics of freshwater bacteria by changing the availability of nutrients, algal exudates and biological surfaces. To elucidate these effects of phytoplankton development in spring in oligotrophic Lake Stechlin (Germany), we measured limnological and biological parameters, including the bacterial community composition (BCC), at the depth of the highest chlorophyll a concentration. To increase the resolution of BCC measurements, we separated particle-associated (PA) and free-living (FL) bacteria using serial filtration through 5.0 and 0.2 mu m pore size filters, respectively. The BCC of ultramicrobacteria was also determined by collecting the 0.2 mu m filtrate on 0.1 mu m filters. Changes in the community composition of Bacteria and particularly of Actinobacteria, one of the most important bacterial groups in temperate freshwater habitats, were studied via DGGE analysis of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments. Patterns in BCC dynamics of FL Bacteria and Actinobacteria remained fairly constant throughout the study period, while patterns of PA Bacteria were more variable over time. At the breakdown of the diatom spring bloom, bacterial production and abundance sharply increased, indicating a close coupling between heterotrophic bacteria and algal detritus. The succession in BCC revealed life-style dependent patterns related to specific environmental variables. Our results indicate independent dynamics of PA and FL Bacteria as well as Actinobacteria during succession of phytoplankton spring blooms. These differences in bacterial lifestyle can only be resolved when the PA and FL fractions of microorganisms are separated.

It gives evidence of three major successive palaeohydrological periods, with (1) a pronounced dryness during the early Holocene until ca 10300 cal BP, (2) a highstand from ca 10300 to 4500 cal BP, and (3) a marked lowstand from 4500 cal BP to present. Large amplitude lake-level fluctuations characterise two transition phases at ca 10300-9000 and 6400-4500 cal BP. Period 2 was interrupted between 8300 and 7000 cal BP by a dry phase that was punctuated to ca 7300 cal BP by the deposition of a tephra from neighbouring Pantelleria Island. Comparisons of the Preola record with other palaehydrological records along north-south and west-east transects in the Mediterranean show contrasting patterns of hydrological changes: north (south) of around 40 degrees N latitude, the records highlight a mid-Holocene period characterised by lake-level minima (maxima). Humid mid-Holocene conditions over the Mediterranean south of 40 degrees N were probably linked to a strong weakening of the Hadley cell circulation and of monsoon winds. We suggest that the maximum of humidity in the Mediterranean during the mid-Holocene was characterised by humid winters to the north of 40 degrees N and humid summers to the south. On a multi-centennial scale, the high-resolution palaeohydrological reconstructions in the central Mediterranean area reveal a strong climate reversal around 4500-4000 cal BP, with contrasting changes in the hydrological cycle. In addition to seasonal and inter-hemispherical changes related to orbital forcing, this major oscillation might be related to non-linear responses of the climatic system to the gradual decrease in summer insolation at northern latitudes. Another major climate oscillation around 7500-7000 cal BP may have resulted from the combined effects of (1) a strong rate of change in insolation, and (2) variations in solar activity. Finally, comparisons of the Preola lake-level record with Sicilian pollen records suggest a strong influence of moisture availability on vegetation development in Sicily. Very dry early Holocene conditions probably prevented the expansion of coastal evergreen forests, while decreasing moisture availability since the onset of the late Holocene may have exacerbated effects of intensive land-use.

Permafrost thaw drives surface water decline across lake-rich regions of the Arctic	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE												Lakes constitute 20-40% of Arctic lowlands, the largest surface water fraction of any terrestrial biome. These lakes provide crucial habitat for wildlife, supply water for remote Arctic communities and play an important role in carbon cycling and the regional energy balance. Recent evidence suggests that climate change is shifting these systems towards long-term wetting (lake formation or expansion) or drying. The net direction and cause of these shifts, however, are not well understood. Here, we present evidence for large-scale drying across lake-rich regions of the Arctic over the past two decades (2000-2021), a trend that is correlated with increases in annual air temperature and autumn rain. Given that increasing air temperatures and autumn rain promote permafrost thaw, our results indicate that permafrost thaw is leading to widespread surface water decline, challenging models that do not predict a net decrease in lake area until the mid-twenty-first or twenty-second centuries. The Arctic lowlands are characterized by a large number of lakes that cover a substantial part of the surface in some regions. Here, the authors apply a machine learning approach to satellite data to show that permafrost thaw since 2000 has caused a decline in surface water in these regions.					; Webb, Elizabeth/JMC-6974-2023; witharana, chandi/C-9074-2015; Loranty, Michael/A-1518-2009; Lichstein, Jeremy/GMW-6555-2022	Cordeiro, Jada/0000-0003-2550-9498; Lichstein, Jeremy/0000-0001-5553-6142; Webb, Elizabeth/0000-0001-5398-4478; Loranty, Michael/0000-0001-8851-7386; Liljedahl, Anna/0000-0001-7114-6443													1758-678X	1758-6798				SEP	2022	12	9					841	+		10.1038/s41558-022-01455-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01455-w		AUG 2022											WOS:000847259100002
J	Mankiewicz-Boczek, J; Font-Nájera, A				Mankiewicz-Boczek, Joanna; Font-Najera, Arnoldo			Temporal and functional interrelationships between bacterioplankton communities and the development of a toxigenic Microcystis bloom in a lowland European reservoir	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The cyanobacteria-associated microbiome is constantly reshaped by bloom development. However, the synergistic-antagonistic nature of the relationships between Microcystis and its microbiome still remains unclear. Therefore, temporal changes of bacterioplankton communities and their functional potential through different developing stages of a Microcystis toxigenic bloom were investigated, considering bacterioplankton assemblages as particle-attached (PAB) and free-living (FLB) bacteria. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that PAB were represented by Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria, while FLB by Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. Network and ordination analyses indicated that PAB inter-relationships were more complex-numerous connections between taxa with stronger correlations, than FLB-rather influenced by physico-chemical parameters. PAB in pre-summer was diverse with Proteobacteria containing potential taxa involved in nitrogen-transforming processes. In mid-summer, PAB presented a mix-bloom dominated by Snowella, Aphanizomenon, and Microcystis, which were succeeded by toxigenic Microcystis in post-summer. Both periods were associated to potential taxa with parasitic/predatory lifestyles against cyanobacteria. In post-summer, Sutterellaceae were recognized as poor water quality indicators, and their strong association with Microcystis could have represented an increased threat for that period. Microcystis was a major factor significantly reducing PAB diversity and evenness, suggesting that it negatively influenced bacterioplankton assemblages, probably also altering the overall community functional potential.

J	Yang, CH; Yang, P; Geng, J; Yin, HB; Chen, KN				Yang, Chunhui; Yang, Pan; Geng, Jian; Yin, Hongbin; Chen, Kaining			Sediment internal nutrient loading in the most polluted area of a shallow eutrophic lake (Lake Chaohu, China) and its contribution to lake eutrophication	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												It is well known that sediment internal loading can worsen lake water quality for many years even if effective measures have been taken to control external loading. In this study, a 12-month field study was carried out to reveal the relationship between sediment phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) forms as well as their fluxes across sediment-water interface from the most polluted area of Lake Chaohu, a large shallow eutrophication lake in China. The possible contribution of mobile fraction of P and N to lake eutrophication is also analyzed. The results indicate that the content of total P and N and their forms in water and sediment were rather dynamic during the year-long field investigation. Low concentrations of P and N from sediment and overlying water were observed in the winter but increased sharply in summer. The phosphate and ammonium fluxes showed evident seasonal variation, and higher fluxes can be observed in warmer seasons especially during the period of algal bloom with high sedimentation. The reduction of ferric iron and degradation of organic matter could be responsible for the increased P flux from sediment in algal bloom seasons, which is consistent with the seasonal variation of P forms in sediment. A comparison of the mole ratio of P flux:N flux to both the P:N mole ratio in sediments and the Redfield ratio was used to further distinguish the dominant sediment P forms' release during seasonal variation. Moreover, the anoxic condition and enhanced microbial activity in warmer seasons contribute a lot to the ammonium release from sediment. Consequently, the nutrient fluxes seasonally influence their corresponding nutrient concentrations in the overlying water. The results of this study indicate that sediment internal loading plays an important role in the eutrophication of Lake Chaohu. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

On the spatiotemporal coincidence of meteorites in recent fall search campaigns	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY												The meteoritical community widely assumes that the probability of finding two meteorites from different falls laying in close proximity is negligible. However, recent studies have suggested that spatiotemporal coincidences may be critical when associating a meteorite with a witnessed fall. In this work, we estimate the number of accumulated meteorites - those resulting from past falls - that are present in landing regions of new falls, while accounting for the effects of terrestrial weathering. We present a simple, fast-computing model to estimate such probability, validated with a Monte Carlo approach based on dark flight computations from real meteorite-dropping fireball data. Considering meteorite masses higher than 10 g, our results indicate that in regions with minimal weathering, like Antarctica, the probability of encountering a previous meteorite within a new fall strewn field may be as high as 75 per cent. In environments with higher weathering rates, like countryside or urban regions, this probability decreases to less than or similar to 1 per cent . When considering the 30 g Lake Frome 006 meteorite coincidence case, the probability of recovering a non-related meteorite with an age of 3.2 kyr from a 0.7 km(2) search area is 6.9 per cent. In the case of the 1 kg Ischgl meteorite, the probability of coincidence with another fresh meteorite of similar mass is 0.06 per cent assuming a large strewn field of 210 km(2). Applied to the Almahata Sitta case, our model predicts a 11.3 per cent of coincidence with a previous meteorite fall. Our results strongly suggest that isotopic dating is essential before associating any meteorite with a witnessed fall.

This is despite the presence of CO2-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) in some species that maximize inorganic carbon uptake. We investigated the effects of inorganic carbon on the seasonal distribution, growth rates and photosynthesis of a freshwater diatom, Asterionella formosa, and the nature of its CCM using genomics. In a productive lake, the frequency of A. formosa declined with CO2 concentration below air-equilibrium. In contrast, CO2 concentrations at 2.5-times air-equilibrium did not increase growth rate, cell C-quota or the ability to remove inorganic carbon. A pH-drift experiment strongly suggested that HCO3- as well as CO2 could be used. Calculations combining hourly inorganic carbon concentrations in a lake with known CO2 and HCO3- uptake kinetics suggested that rates of photosynthesis of A. formosa would be approximately carbon saturated and largely dependent on CO2 uptake when CO2 was at or above air-equilibrium. However, during summer carbon depletion, HCO3- would be the major form of carbon taken up and carbon saturation will fall to around 30%. Genes encoding proteins involved in CCMs were identified in the nuclear genome of A. formosa. We found carbonic anhydrases from subclasses alpha, beta, gamma and theta, as well as solute carriers from families 4 and 26 involved in HCO3- transport, but no periplasmic carbonic anhydrase. A model of the components of the CCM and their location in A. formosa showed that they are more similar to Phaeodactylum tricornutum than to Thalassiosira pseudonana, two marine diatoms.

J	Nicola, GG; Almodóvar, A				Nicola, GG; Almodóvar, A			Growth pattern of stream-dwelling brown trout under contrasting thermal conditions	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Growth of brown trout Salmo trutta was analyzed based on 3 years of simultaneous temperature and growth data from seven streams of contrasting chemical and biological character. A laboratory-based growth model was employed to examine geographical variation in growth performance among wild populations. A sensitivity analysis of model predictions was also performed based on simulated optimum temperatures for growth within the range of observed temperatures and on the optimum temperature used in the model. In spite of the diverse environmental conditions, the annual increment in body mass was not significantly different among most populations. However, the ratio of the actual growth rate to the maximum growth rate predicted by the model differed among rivers. A significant negative correlation was found between this ratio and mean annual water temperature. The growth model thus underestimated growth in the coldest rivers, suggesting that adaptations to local thermal conditions can occur at a small geographical scale. Seasonal changes in the fit to the growth model were also different among rivers. Our simulations showed that, in almost all rivers, the best fit to the model among age-1 trout was obtained at lower values of optimum temperature in both spring and summer. Our findings suggest that the parameters of the model may not be identical for all brown trout populations. The discrepancies between observed and predicted growth indicated that temperature alone did not account for all the spatial and temporal variation in growth rates.					Almodovar, Ana/L-5400-2014; G.

SPRING MOVEMENT ECOLOGY OF BLANCHARD'S CRICKET FROG (ACRIS BLANCHARDI) IN SOUTHWESTERN WISCONSIN, USA	HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY												Blanchard's Cricket Frog (Acris blanchardi) uses seasonal movements as an important and often necessary survival strategy. The objectives of our research were to study spring cricket frog movements, habitat use, and life history to better inform management decisions for this state-listed endangered species. We also experimented with marking techniques. We used visual encounter surveys to investigate its ecology and phenology, and marking (e.g., toe-clipping) surveys and photographic identification to investigate individual and group movements. We documented movements from overwintering (e.g., rivers and streams) to breeding (e.g., wetlands and lakes) locations from mid-April to June in southwestern Wisconsin, USA. We did not always detect migrations away from overwintering sites on the river. Most female movements occurred after males had moved to breeding locations. Marking and photographing individuals was successful in verifying movement distances up to 662 m, suggesting that individual cricket frogs can be effectively identified over a one-month span by using this approach. Our results suggest that Blanchard's Cricket Frog spring movements in southwestern Wisconsin occur predominantly along waterbody corridors linking overwintering to breeding habitat. Conservation plans should incorporate use of these movement corridors into habitat management actions to enhance preservation of the species.																			2151-0733	1931-7603				AUG	2021	16	2					271	280																WOS:000691788400005
J	Malve, O; Laine, M; Haario, H				Malve, O; Laine, M; Haario, H			Estimation of winter respiration rates and prediction of oxygen regime in a lake using Bayesian inference	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												In this paper. we estimate the winter respiration (oxygen depletion per unit area of hypolimnetic surface) in a hyper-eutrophic shallow lake (Tuusulanjarvi) in the northern hemisphere (Finland, northern Europe, latitude 60degrees26', longitude 25degrees03') under ice-cover periods in the years 1970-2003. We present a dynamic nonlinear model that can be used for predicting of the oxygen regime in following years and to dimensioning of needed artificial oxygenation efficiency that will prevent fish kills in the lake. We use Bayesian estimation of respiration using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method (Adaptive Metropolis-Hastings algorithm). This allows for analysis and predictions that take into account all the uncertainties in the model and the data, pool information from different sources (laboratory experiments and lake data), and to quantify the uncertainties using a full statistical approach. The mean estimated respiration in the study period was 301 +/- 105 mg m(-2) d(-1), which is on the upper limit of winter respiration of eutrophic Canadian lakes on the same latitude. The reference rate of the respiration k (d(-1)) at 4degreesC indicated cyclic behavior of about 9-year amplitude and had a statistically significant negative trend through out the study period. The temperature coefficient and respiration rate of the model prove to be highly correlated and unidentifiable with the given data. The future winters can be predicted using the posterior information coming from the past observations. As new observations arrive. they are added to the analysis. Methods are shown to be applicable to the dimensioning of artificial oxygenation devices and to the anticipation of the need for oxygenation during the winter. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Carbon dioxide hydrodynamics along a wetland-lake-stream-waterfall continuum (Blue Mountains, Australia)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The small-scale spatial variability in dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) and water-air CO2 flux dynamics were investigated within first-order catchments of the upper Blue Mountains Plateau (New South Wales, Australia). Water samples were collected at 81 locations during winter and summer over two consecutive years across seven aquatic ecosystem types: wetland, impoundment, lake, tributary stream, mainstem, escarpment complex, and urban-aquatic interface. Dissolved [CO2] ranged from 15 to 880 mu M (94 to 4760%Sat), and dissolved [O-2] from 0 to 350 mu M (0 to 101%Sat). CO2 supersaturation was typically highest in wetlands and vegetated impoundments of the upper plateau, and decreased downstream approaching atmospheric equilibrium at the escarpment waterfalls. Gas transfer velocities ranged from 0.18 m d(-1) in lentic waters to 292 m d(-1) at the bottom of waterfalls due to bubble-mediated transfer. The first-and second-order streams represented only 4.8% of the total open water area yet contributed to 61% of the total water-air CO2 outgassing. The lake, escarpment and mainstem group systems had narrow diel and seasonal CO2 concentration variability, while wetlands and vegetated impoundments had the widest ranges. Our high resolution spatio-temporal sampling was essential to identifying CO2 outgassing hotspots in these geomorphically diverse catchments. Overall, >95% of excess dissolved CO2 traversing the upper Blue Mountains Plateau was outgassed to the atmosphere. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Alekseev, V; Lampert, W				Alekseev, V; Lampert, W			Maternal effects of photoperiod and food level on life history characteristics of the cladoceran Daphnia pulicaria Forbes	HYDROBIOLOGIA					6th International Symposium on Cladocera	AUG 19-23, 2002	Wierzba, POLAND					The response of various life-history characteristics of Daphnia pulicaria to photoperiod and food concentration was measured in 16 combinations of maternal and offspring environments ( long vs. short day, high vs. low food) in flow-through experiments. Response variables in offspring were time and survival to release of first offspring, clutch size and neonate mass in the first brood, mass of adult females after 30 days and somatic growth rate during the course of the experiment. Most of these parameters were directly controlled by food concentration in the offspring environment, but maternal effects frequently modified the response. A long day length in the maternal environment resulted in a prolongation of the time to first clutch release in offspring similar to the direct effect of low food. Likewise, survival to maturation and female mass were affected by maternal photoperiod. Somatic growth rate and clutch size responded to combined effects of maternal food conditions and photoperiod. The laboratory results were used to predict the seasonal change of fecundity of Daphnia in the field. When data on clutch size are ordered in a sequence as the different combinations of maternal and offspring environment occur during the seasonal succession in a temperate lake, they show a bimodal distribution with a high peak in spring and a lower peak in fall. This pattern is consistent with field observations. We conclude that photoperiod and maternal effects are important factors influencing life history and population dynamics of Daphnia.					; alekseev, victor/C-7086-2014	Alekseev, Victor/0000-0002-1968-2609; 													0018-8158					SEP	2004	526	1			SI		225	230		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000041600.16226.12	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000041600.16226.12													WOS:000223915900023

The goals of the construction projects were to improve sportfishing opportunity in nearshore waters, evaluate the effectiveness of reefs as fish-concentration devices, and eventually assist other coastal communities in developing artificial reef programs. From 1992 to 1995, we conducted evaluations to assess the effectiveness of these artificial reefs as sport fish attractors and to establish their Value in sport fishery enhancement projects. Underwater VHS video was used by scuba divers to identify and enumerate fish at both artificial reef sites and at adjacent nonreef control sites. Observation dives were done monthly, weather permitting, from May through October each year. T-tests were used to determine seasonal differences in fish abundance between the reef and control sites. At both sites, total seasonal numbers of fish were significantly higher (20-50 times more) at the reef site than the control site (p = 0.05). Smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu were the dominant species at both reef sites, comprising over 80% of the observations during most months. Total seasonal numbers of smallmouth bass were also higher during spring and fall than in midsummer, suggesting seasonal patterns and preferences for artificial structure. We conclude that, when properly planned and located, artificial reefs would provide beneficial fish habitat along most of Lake Erie's nearshore zone and may have application Great Lakes-wide.																			0892-2284		1-888569-12-3				1998	22						335	347																WOS:000082192300025
J	Kim, SY; Koretsky, C				Kim, Seon-young; Koretsky, Carla			Influence of NaCl and CaCl2 on lake sediment biogeochemistry	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The influence of two commonly used road salt deicers, NaCl and CaCl2, on sediment biogeochemistry was investigated using a series of core incubations. Sediment cores collected in fall 2009 and spring 2010 were incubated for 100 days in 1 or 5 g/L CaCl2 center dot 2H(2)O, 5 g/L NaCl or DI water (control). For each treatment, 3 cores were sacrificed every month, sliced into three intervals (0-5, 5-10 or 10-15 cm depth) and the pore waters analyzed for pH, total alkalinity, dissolved Fe(II), Mn(II), NH4+, PO43-, SO42-, sulfide, Na, Mg, K and Ca. Addition of NaCl, and especially 5 g/L CaCl2 center dot H2O, resulted in the growth of microbial mats on the surfaces of the cores and stimulated anaerobic production of dissolved Mn(II) and Fe(II) in the sediment pore waters. This is hypothesized to be the result of nutrient release (e.g., K, Ca, trace elements) via ion exchange processes, which fueled primary production and subsequent organic matter degradation in the cores treated with NaCl or CaCl2. Such processes may be significant in wetland sediments impacted by large loadings of salt from road deicers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Scott			Holocene changes in moisture source and temperature revealed by the oxygen isotopic composition of fossil Daphnia ephippia in Sierra Nevada, southern Spain	CATENA												The study of oxygen isotopes in chitin and its use as a paleoclimatic proxy is still under development. The low oxygen content of chitin and the low sample weight of fossils have hindered this research topic, even though there is evidence of a strong correlation between the oxygen isotopic composition of chitin and the isotopic composition of the host water. In order to further this research we present a paleoclimatic reconstruction based on 518O of cladoceran remains from the lake sediments of Laguna de Rio Seco, Sierra Nevada, Spain. Here, modern water isotopic data were used as a modern analogue to establish an important influence on evaporative enrichment as the ice-free season advances. The oxygen isotope signal from Daphnia resting eggs was used as a proxy for autumn snapshots of the water isotopic composition at millennial time scales. Long-term changes were controlled by the moisture source and the summer insolation. Between deglaciation and 4.2 kyr BP, 518O measurements exhibited generally depleted values only interrupted by a peak at - 7.2 kyr BP, concurrent with a temperature maximum inferred from earlier quantitative reconstructions. A predominantly Atlantic moisture source and changes in the evaporation related to seasonality explained the isotopic variability at that time. From 4.2 kyr BP onwards, a notable enrichment in this isotopic signal occurred, which was consistent with greater influence of a Mediterranean precipitation source and higher evaporation at lower lake levels. This new isotope record provides a unique application of paleoclimates from cladocerans, which goes beyond the taxonomic and numerative methodology traditionally used in subfossil cladoceran analysis.

J	Stoffels, RJ; Closs, GP; Burns, CW				Stoffels, RJ; Closs, GP; Burns, CW			Multiple scales and the relationship between density and spatial aggregation in littoral zone communities	OIKOS												Understanding the constraints on community composition at multiple spatial scales is an immense challenge to community and ecosystem ecologists. As community composition is basically the composite result of species' spatial patterning, studying this spatial patterning across scales may yield clues as to which scales of environmental heterogeneity influence communities. The now widely documented positive interspecific relationship between 'regional' range and mean 'local' abundance has become a generalisation describing the spatial patterning of species at coarse scales. We address some of the shortcomings of this generalisation, as well as examine the cross-scale spatial patterning (aggregation and density levels) of littoral-benthic invertebrates in very large lakes. Specifically, we (a) determine whether the positive range-abundance relationship can be reinterpreted in terms of the actual spatial structure of species distributions, (b) examine the relationship between aggregation and density across different spatial scales, and (c) determine whether the spatial patterning of species (e.g. low density/aggregated distribution) is constant across scales, that is, whether our interpretation of a species spatial pattern is dependent on the scale at which we choose to observe the system. Spatial aggregation of littoral invertebrates was generally a negative function of mean density across all spatial scales and seasons (autumn and spring). This relationship may underlie positive range-abundance relationships. Species that were uncommon and highly aggregated at coarse spatial scales can be abundant and approach random distributions at finer spatial scales. Also, the change in spatial aggregation of closely related taxa across spatial scales was idiosyncratic. The idiosyncratic cross-scale spatial patterning of species implies that multiple scales of environmental heterogeneity may influence the assembly of littoral communities. Due to the multi-scale, species-specific spatial patterning of invertebrates, littoral zone communities form a complex spatial mosaic, and a 'spatially explicit' approach will be required by limnologists in order to link littoral-benthic community patterns with ecosystem processes in large oligotrophic lakes.					; Stoffels, Rick/H-3595-2011; Closs, Gerard/AAE-5883-2019	Closs, Gerard/0000-0003-4550-6024; Stoffels, Rick/0000-0003-4888-5875; 													0030-1299	1600-0706				OCT	2003	103	1					81	92		10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12453.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12453.x													WOS:000186118000009

J	QUINN, JP; JANSSEN, J				QUINN, JP; JANSSEN, J			CRAYFISH COMPETITION IN SOUTHWESTERN LAKE-MICHIGAN - A PREDATOR MEDIATED BOTTLENECK	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Two species of crayfish, Orconectes virilis and O. propinquus, are found in southwest Lake Michigan in rocky areas 6-15 m deep. Both species are recruited in summer at approximately 6 mm, but by fall juvenile O. virilis are larger than juvenile O. propinquus. Adult O. virilis are 30-45 mm and O. propinquus are 17-30 mm. O. virilis comprises about 40% of the eggs and juveniles but account for 20% of the adult population. Our data suggest that O. virilis has a refuge from competition and predation only when it is larger than O. propinquus. The juvenile O. virilis must growh through the adult O. propinquus size class to reach adult size. This also is the size that crayfish are most vulnerable to yellow perch (Perca flavescens) predation. O. virilis is more heavily preyed on than O. propinquus. O. propinquus apparently displace like size O. virilis from shelters leaving them more vulnearable to perch predation. Thus to attain refuge from competition and predation O. virilis must survive this predator-mediated competitive bottleneck. The relatively greater mortality is offset by the greater individual fecundity of O. virilis. Thus fewer O. vilis need reach maturity and reproduce to produce sufficient offspring to maintain their numbers.

Determining resident microbial community members and their correlations with geochemistry in a serpentinizing spring	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Terrestrial serpentinizing systems allow us insight into the realm of alkaliphilic microbial communities driven by geology in a way that is frequently more accessible than their deep subsurface or marine counterparts. However, these systems are also marked by geochemical and microbial community variation due to the interactions of serpentinized fluids with host geology and the surface environment. To separate the transient from the endemic microbes in a hyperalkaline environment, we assessed the Ney Springs terrestrial serpentinizing system microbial community and geochemistry at six time points over the span of a year. Using 16S rRNA gene surveys we observed 93 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) that were found at every sampling event. This is compared to similar to 17,000 transient ASVs that were detected only once across the six sampling events. Of the resident community members, 16 of these ASVs were regularly greater than 1% of the community during every sampling period. Additionally, many of these core taxa experienced statistically significant changes in relative abundance with time. Variation in the abundance of some core populations correlated with geochemical variation. For example, members of the Tindallia group, showed a positive correlation with variation in levels of ammonia at the spring. Investigating the metagenome assembled genomes of these microbes revealed evidence of the potential for ammonia generation via Stickland reactions within Tindallia. This observation offers new insight into the origin of high ammonia concentrations (>70 mg/L) seen at this site. Similarly, the abundance of putative sulfur-oxidizing microbes like Thiomicrospira, Halomonas, and a Rhodobacteraceae species could be linked to changes observed in sulfur-oxidation intermediates like tetrathionate and thiosulfate. While these data supports the influence of core microbial community members on a hyperalkaline spring's geochemistry, there is also evidence that subsurface processes affect geochemistry and may impact community dynamics as well. Though the physiology and ecology of these astrobiologically relevant ecosystems are still being uncovered, this work helps identify a stable microbial community that impacts spring geochemistry in ways not previously observed in serpentinizing ecosystems.

J	Hesthagen, T; Langeland, A; Berger, HM				Hesthagen, T; Langeland, A; Berger, HM			Effects of acidification due to emissions from the Kola Peninsula on fish populations in lakes near the Russian border in Northern Norway	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												In this paper we document the effects of acidification on fish populations in lakes in Sor-Varanger near the Russian border in northern Norway. We used questionnaires in order to assess the current status and distribution of different fish species, and conducted test-fishing to determine relative abundance (CPUE-T) and age structure. Acidification of surface waters in this area is due to emissions of SO2 from smelters on the Kola Peninsula in Russia (Nikel and Zapoljarnij) between 10 and 30 km from the Norwegian border. Sulphur deposition in Sor-Varanger ranges from 0.6 to 2.0 g S m(-2) yr(-1), which is similar to levels in the most acidified areas in southern Norway. However, a dominant fraction of the acidic deposition reaches the ground in particulate form during summer and autumn. Coastal areas in Sor-Varanger receive small amounts of precipitation; the annual mean is 580 mm. We obtained fish status from 401 lakes, about 40% of all lakes larger than 3 ha, which were inhabited by 236 and 293 populations of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) and brown trout (Salmo trutta), respectively. The extent of fish damage was small as only three populations of Arctic charr were lost, while three populations of Arctic charr and eight populations of brown trout were at various stages of reduction. Damaged and lost fish populations were identified in smaller lakes at relatively high elevations (172-349 m) in six areas in the Jarfjord Mountains, covering a land area of 30.0 km(2). Most of the damage probably occurred during the 1970s and 1980s. In lakes that supported or had supported Arctic charr and brown trout, we found a significant relationship between CPUE-T, and acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) and pH, and also between alkalinity and the concentration of inorganic Al for brown trout. In both species, the catch of fish in age groups 1+ and 2+ (CPUE-R) increased significantly with CPUE-T. Affected populations typically exhibited irregular age composition, and age-classes were missing, indicating that reductions in fish populations were due to recruitment failure. The limited fish damage is related to relatively good catchment resistance to acidic inputs, small amounts of wet deposition as well as precipitation. These conditions result in low accumulation of acidic compounds, producing less acidic run-off waters and few episodes of unfavourable water quality.																			0049-6979					FEB	1998	102	1-2					17	36		10.1023/A:1004961208891	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004961208891													WOS:000072503900002

Values of most of the parameters, viz., turbidity (7.79 NTU), pH (7.24), total dissolved solids (217.46 mg/l), biochemical oxygen demand (2.10 mg/l) and total hardness (90.69 mg/l) were found higher in the rainy season. During the study, it was observed that as the holy River Ganga flows from Rishikesh to Haridwar, the values of certain parameters, such as pH (7.22), biochemical oxygen demand (2.58 mg/l), total dissolved solids (201.92 mg/l) and total hardness (107.13 mg/l) increase. Similarities and variations between the parameters were analyzed by a multivariate statistical method like principal component analysis (PCA), Pearson correlation coefficient, cluster analysis (CA), t-test, etc. Pearson correlation matrix of physicochemical parameters strongly correlates with each other indicating the inter-dependency of the variables. Seasonal similarity in summer and winter in dendrodram shows the impact of anthropogenic activity on the water quality of the Ganga River. The value of WQI indicates better water quality at Rishikesh (35.23) than that at Haridwar (47.34). The study concludes that water of the Ganga River at both sites can be used for domestic and agricultural purposes but precautions and extensive measures are necessary before consumption.

Different types of climate proxy data may provide season-, time resolution-, and longevity-specific information. In this paper, we present a reconstruction of summer temperature and ablation of Malii Aktru glacier Altay Mountains, for the past four centuries inferred from lake Teletskoe sediments and the maximum density of the tree-rings of Siberian larch trees found at the upper timberline. The Teletskoe lake is situated close to both the Malii Aktru glacier and the tree-ring-maximum-density-chronology site (approxinately 50.29N, 87.39E). Lake Teletskoe sediments provided seasonal climatic information for the late Holocene, especially regarding summer and annual temperature variations. Ablation of the Malii Aktru glacier was also clearly sensitive to summer temperature (correlation was 0.8; p=0.05; n=32). The tree-ring maximum density chronology was well correlated with summer temperature (r=+0.65-0.72; n = 60). Ablation of Malii Aktru glacier was reconstructed using the linear regression from the tree-ring maximum density chronology (r=+0.68; n=32; p=0.05 for the calibration period) for the period since 1601 AD. The summer temperature reconstructed from the data on the lake sediments was compared with the reconstructed ablation of Malii Aktru glacier for 1601-1994. A common low-frequency variability (100-200-year long cycles) was identified in the summer temperature and ablation for the reconstructed series. For example, a decrease in ablation of Malii Aktru coincided well with a temperature decrease that was found around 1700 AD and middle of 1850AD. The cold periods during LIA (Little Ice Age) were clearly pronounced in Altai Mountains climate reconstructions obtained from different climate proxies. Our study showed that various sources (tree-rings, glaciers and lake sediments) may be based upon to extract common information on climate low frequency variables, which helps better understand regional climate changes.

Here, we provide paleoclimate reconstructions based on n-alkanes and branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) from a 50-ka lacustrine sediment core collected from Lake Tengchong Qinghai in southwestern subtropical China. Our results reveal that the botanical sources of sedimentary n-alkanes in this lake are mainly from aquatic macrophytes and terrestrial plants. The lake level evolution from the MIS 3 to the Holocene can be divided into four stages: high in the MIS 3, low in the LGM, high in last deglacial and low in mid and late Holocene. Our brGDGTs-based climate reconstructions indicate that the mean air temperature differences between the present-day and the LGM were up to about 3-4 degrees C. From MIS 3 to Holocene, there was a broadly and consistently synchronous trend between precipitation and air temperature in this ISM region. This is different from the asynchronous temperature and precipitation variations in the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) regions in the period of last glacial termination. Our study shows that the climate in ISM regions was primarily driven by changes in June summer solar insolation at 30 degrees N, and those glacial boundary conditions such as ice volume and sea surface temperature might also have affected the ISM.

Constraining carbonaceous aerosol sources in a receptor model by including 14C data with redox species, organic tracers, and elemental/organic carbon measurements	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Sources of carbonaceous PM2.5 were quantified in downtown Cleveland, OH and Chippewa Lake, OH located similar to 40 miles southwest of Cleveland during the Cleveland Multiple Air Pollutant Study (CMAPS). PM2.5 filter samples were collected daily during July-August 2009 and February 2010 to establish the seasonal emission patterns from local and regional sources. Radiocarbon (C-14), redox species (NOx, SO2 and ozone), 28 primary and secondary organic aerosol tracers, elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) measurements were analyzed using the EPA Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model to apportion carbonaceous aerosol sources. Five sources were identified at each site: mobile sources, fossil fuel combustion from fuels containing sulfur, local biomass combustion, other combustion (regional biomass, waste, meat, coal), and secondary organic aerosol (SOA). C-14 data were incorporated in the PMF analysis as a novel method to obtain the modern carbon fraction (f(mod)) of each source individually which aided all factor interpretations. SOA was the principal carbon source during summer as shown by the PMF analysis and a separate tracer based mass fraction method while biomass burning and other combustion sources were dominant in winter. Elevated levels of EC and fossilized carbon in downtown Cleveland are primarily attributed to increased mobile source and coal combustion emissions. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Three of these four families of Trichoptera were also recorded in the Central European lakes. From among the four substrates (sand, silt, large stones, and aquatic plants) of the littoral zone, silt and aquatic plants were dominant. Besides species of Limnephilidae found in higher than the average abundance in the silt, species of Phryganeidae and Leptoceridae also occurred. The trophic relationships of the species of these families can be considered as follows: shredders- predators- scrapers, shredders- detritivores- predators, and predators- shredders- scrapers. From the aquatic plants the species of Limnephilidae, Phryganeidae and Leptoceridae, belonging to the trophic relationships of detritivores- shredders, scrapers- predators, shredders- detritivores- predators, and predators- shredders- scrapers- detritivores were collected. The analysis (PCA) of the spatial and seasonal distribution of Trichopteran larvae at the four littoral zone sites shows that the assemblages collected near the inflow of the stream into the lake in late summer and near the inflow of the small channel into the lake in summer are very different from the others, for which Limnephilus elegans, Micropterna lateralis, and Stenophylax permistus are responsible at the previous site, while Halesus digitatus, Halesus tessellatus, and Mystacides nigra are responsible at the latter one. The other assemblages (mostly those in winter) are very similar to each other, which can be explained by the decreasing number of detectable species and their presence in low abundance. For the variance, Limnephilus rhombicus (57%) and Potamophylax nigricornis (16%) are essentially responsible. Considering the species composition of the larval assemblages, the site at the inflow of the stream into the lake was the most different (38%) from the others, and was 62% similar to them. This dissimilarity can possibly be explained by the presence of a mixed assemblage with typical stream and lake inhabitants of species of Limnephilidae present in high abundance at this silt dominated site and other caddis species that are typical stream inhabitants or common in streams and small rivers, and may have drifted into the take.

J	Croston, NJ; Bubb, JM; Lester, JN				Croston, NJ; Bubb, JM; Lester, JN			Spatial distribution and seasonal changes in methylmercury concentrations in shallow lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The environmental factors governing the distribution and behaviour of total and methylmercury within mercury contaminated shallow lakes, associated with the River Yare, Norfolk, UK, have been assessed in situ through the use of sediment cores. These were analysed for microbial and chemical changes on both a temporal and spatial scale. The distribution of total mercury proved to be site dependent and related to the hydrology, sediment transport dynamics, the degree of sediment disturbance and distance from the contamination source. The core profiles revealed a subsurface peak in total mercury with maximum concentrations residing at depths of 12 and 36 cm, depending upon location, with enrichment extending down to depths in excess of 88 cm. This vertical distribution was deemed to reflect historical emission in the late 1960s and early 1970s rather than post depositional migration effects. The distribution of methylmercury was distinct from that of its inorganic counterpart since it also displayed temporal variability with highest concentrations occurring in the spring and summer. Maximum concentrations also prevailed in the uppermost 12 cm of sediment, with peak loadings at or just below the sediment/water interface and detectable levels being restricted to the upper 36 cm. The temporal and spatial behaviour of methylmercury appeared to reflect variations in redox potential, the availability of the Hg2+ ion and the nature of microbial populations.																			0018-8158					MAR 8	1996	321	1					35	45		10.1007/BF00018675	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00018675													WOS:A1996UF88300005
J	Jones, B; Renaut, RW				Jones, B; Renaut, RW			Morphology and growth of aragonite crystals in hot-spring travertines at Lake Bogoria, Kenya rift valley	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Pseudohexagonal aragonite crystals are common components in some hot-spring travertines at Chemurkeu on the western shore of Lake Bogoria, Kenya. Beds, lenses and pods of aragonite crystals are intercalated with beds of white non-crystallographic calcite dendrites, The pseudohexagonal aragonite crystals, which are up to 4 cm long and 4 mm wide, are formed of nested skeletal crystals. Each skeletal crystal is formed of cyclical twinned crystals that are constructed of stacked subcrystals. The latter are inclined at a consistent angle of 40 degrees to the long axis of the pseudohexagonal aragonite crystal. Intense competition for space during growth modified the crystal morphology with the result that many of the pseudohexagonal crystals are distorted. Intercrystalline and intracrystalline pores are filled or partly filled by epitaxial aragonite overgrowths and/or reticulate microbial coatings that have a high concentration of Si and Mg. In places, this extracellular mucus induced etching of the underlying aragonite crystal. Today the hot (T>95 degrees C) Na-HCO3-Cl spring waters at Chemurkeu have a salinity of 5-6 g L(-1) TDS, a pH of 8.1-9.1, Ca2+ concentrations of <2 mg L(-1) and Mg2+ concentrations of <0.7 mg L(-1). The springs of the Lake Bogoria Geothermal Field are fed by a shallow aquifer (T approximate to 100 degrees C) and a deeper aquifer (T approximate to 170 degrees C). Springs at Chemurkeu derive from meteoric ground water, lake water and condensed steam, and are fed mainly from the shallow thermal aquifer, Much of the aragonite may have formed when the spring waters contained more dissolved Ca2+ than today, possibly under more humid conditions during the Holocene.

Error Analysis on PERSIANN Precipitation Estimations: Case Study of Urmia Lake Basin, Iran	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												In-depth evaluation and analysis of the error properties associated with satellite-based precipitation estimation algorithms can play an important role in the future development and improvements of these products. This study evaluates the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) daily data set from 2000 to 2011 in 69 pixels over a semiarid basin in northwest Iran and compares it with the data set of the existing rain-gauge network. Different analytical approaches and measures are used to examine PERSIANN performance seasonally and categorically. The residuals are also decomposed into true positive (hit), false negative (miss), and false alarm (FA) estimate biases in addition to systematic and random error components. The results show seasonal variability of PERSIANN precision in rainfall detection with substantial errors during winter and summer that are associated with high rates of FA ratio (more than 60%). The value of miss and FA biases (124 and -77,000mm, respectively, within the total data set) are considerably larger than hit and total bias (27 and 74,000mm, respectively) because these components contribute conversely and compensate each other by their opposite signs. Moreover, PERSIANN detects heavy rainfalls well with a probability of detection (POD) over 80%, but with serious biases. Generally, although the detection ability of PERSIANN improves as the rate of rainfall increases, its systematic error in simulation of the rainfall process also increases (from 5% systematic error to 90% in heavier rainfalls), leading to a low level of accuracy in the estimation of precipitation rate.

Assessing water quality and classifying trophic status for scientifically based managing the water resources of the Lake Timsah, the lake with salinity stratification along the Suez Canal	SAUDI JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Lake Timsah is considered as the biggest water body at Ismailia City with a surface area of 14 km(2). It is a saline shallow water basin lies approximately mid-way between the south city of Suez and the north city of Port Said at 30 degrees 35 ' 46.55"N and 32 degrees 19'30.54"E. Because it receives water with high and low salinities, salinity stratification is producing in the Lake Timsah, with values of 14-40% for the surface water and over 40% for the bottom water. The temperature of the lake water decreased to below 19 degrees C in the winter and rose to above 29 degrees C in the summer; the concentration of dissolved oxygen ranged between 6.5 and 12.2 l (-1) and the pH fluctuated between 7.9 in its lower value and 8.2 in its higher value. Water transparency was very low as indicated by Secchi disc readings recorded during this study and varied between 0.3 and 2.7 m. The main chemical nutrient (phosphorus) reached its highest levels of 96 mu g l (1) in winter and their lowest values of 24 mu g l (1) during summer. This nutrient concentration is high especially by comparing with those of unpolluted marine waters, but is typical of the more eutrophic coastal waters worldwide. The composition and abundance of phytoplankton with dominancy of diatoms and increased population density (20,986 cell l (1)) reflect the eutrophic condition of the lake. The intensive growth of phytoplankton was enriched by high concentration of chlorophyll a with annual values ranged between 6.5 and 56 mu g l (1). The objective of the present work was quantitative assessment of the quality of the water of the Lake Timsah using different approaches. During the present study, three different approaches were applied for the quantitative assessment of Lake Timsah water quality: the trophic state index (TST);trophic level index (TLI) and water quality index (WQI). Application of the trophic state and trophic level indices (TSI & TLI) revealed that the Lake Timsah has trophic indices of 60 and 5.2 for TSI and TLI, respectively. Both indices reflected the eutrophic condition of the lake waters and confirmed that the eutrophication is a major threat in the Lake Timsah. On the other hand, the WQI calculated for the Lake Timsah during the present study with an average of 49 demonstrated that the water of the Lake Timsah is bad and unsuitable for main and/or several uses. Moreover, WQI allows accounting for several water resource uses and can serve a more robust than TSI and/or TLI and can be used effectively as a comprehensive tool for water quality quantification. In conclusion, the three subjective indices used for the assessment process for the lake water are more suitable and effective for needs of the sustainable water resources protection and management of the Lake Timsah.

Drivers of Potential Recharge from Irrigated Agroecosystems in the Wisconsin Central Sands	VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL												The expansion of irrigated agriculture on landscapes underlain by coarse-grained, glacial aquifers in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan changes the timing and magnitude of groundwater recharge. Water managers require improved estimates of groundwater recharge to manage pumping impacts on groundwater-fed streams, lakes, and wetlands. We implemented a network of 25 passive capillary lysimeters to infer potential groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration (ET) from irrigated potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), sweet corn and field corn (Zea mays L.), and pea (Pisum sativum L.)-pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.] rotations in the Wisconsin Central Sands (WCS) from June through November of 2013 to 2016. We found that interannual climate variability, subtle differences in soil texture, and cropping system type drove potential recharge to varying degrees during the summer and fall seasons. Relatively finer soil texture was positively correlated to point estimates of potential recharge. This correlation was the strongest following large precipitation events. June to November cumulative potential recharge for 2013 to 2016 averaged 71 +/- 235 mm across all lysimeters. Our findings suggest that aquifer depletion will be an episodic process that leaves surface waters most vulnerable to pumping and recharge impacts during and following drier years in the WCS. Differences among cropping systems were most pronounced under average precipitation conditions, which facilitated potential groundwater losses under field corn and pea-pearl millet rotations and potential groundwater gains under potato rotations. We conclude that regional water management strategies could be effective in buffering against the interannual climate variability of recharge, while localized management strategies could increase irrigation efficiency by targeting crop and soil textural drivers.

General climate information that can be extracted from historical documents are described and some examples are given. The sources of available documents useful for more quantitative reconstruction purposes are given and assessed. Reconstruction of winter and summer temperature series and dryness/wetness series are then reviewed and discussed. The reconstruction of temperature series were generally based on climatological interpretation of phenological records such as the dates of lake or river freezing, bird migration, or the beginning and ending of snow. Reconstructed temperature series for various parts of China are given. Next, the reconstruction of humidity series are reviewed. The data sources for this purpose are mainly flood, drought, and rain records. Some high quality data sources, such as the daily weather reports, the Clear and Rain Records of Qing Dynasty, are also discusses. The reconstructed series are then used to summarize the general evolution of the monsoon climate of China from 300 to 1900 AD. A brief conclusion is made.																			0026-1165	2186-9057				FEB	1992	70	1B					423	446		10.2151/jmsj1965.70.1B_423	http://dx.doi.org/10.2151/jmsj1965.70.1B_423													WOS:A1992HQ62100015

Nealry 50 spp. were found, with an average of only 12.4/lake. Fifteen species occurred widely, with the same few species (Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri, Potamopyrgus antipodarum and sometimes Chironomus and Macropelopia spp.) often dominant. All taxonomic groups were of limited diversity. The maximum number of chironomids per lake was 8, with an average of 4.7 spp. There were no chaoborids of mayflies, and very few isopods, amphipods, ceratopogonids and water mites. Niches of common species were broad. Species composition and dominance were not related to lake trophic status; hence there were no indicator organisms. Standing crops varied broadly with lake trophic status, probably because of the differential influence of extraneous factors such as relative depth and input of allochthonous organic matter and silt. Depth: biomass profiles were also variable and partly correlated with trophic status. Many lakes were grouped on the basis of geographical area and influence of extraneous factors. Species were grouped according to the relative extent of their distribution.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1982	12	2					123	138		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1982.tb00608.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1982.tb00608.x													WOS:A1982NG74200002
J	VANDERPLOEG, HA				VANDERPLOEG, HA			SEASONAL PARTICLE-SIZE SELECTION BY DIAPTOMUS-SICILIS IN OFFSHORE LAKE-MICHIGAN	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												D. sicilis feeding on offshore Lake Michigan seston exhibited a relatively invariant pattern of particle-size selection in 23 separate feeding experiments conducted from spring through fall over a 2-yr period. This pattern persisted for different feeding rates under varying conditions of particle-size spectrum shape, abundance and food quality of particles and temperature. Selection was quantified by calculating W'' (filtering efficiency) as a function of particle size (equivalent spherical diameter). In all but one of the few experiments yielding a W'' curve that varied appreciably from the other W'' curves, serious bias from grazer-produced particles was evident and/or elongated particles dominated the seston. The elongated particles could have led to deviations because of differences in filtering efficiency between round and elongated particles of small volume and because elongated particles of large volume have to be captured raptorially. The more variable patterns of particle-size selection observed in many of the other studies of zooplankton feeding on natural seston result from: improper methods of quantifying selelction, serious bias from grazer-produced particles and varying particle shape, which is not usually specified. The mechanisms of particle selection by Diaptomus and other species that filter like Diaptomus are reveiwed and it is noted that invariant selection is not inconsistent with both filtering and raptorial modes of feeding operating simultaneously. All the evidence points to a strong passive-mechanical filtering mode of feeding that may be supplemented by a raptorial mode of feeding that selects large particles of high food quality.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1981	38	5					504	517		10.1139/f81-072	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f81-072													WOS:A1981LU67500003

Sediment cores collected from the study area commonly show a fluffy surficial layer which, based on the Be-7 data, is accumulated rapidly by flood sedimentation in the summer time. The depth of 7 Be penetration is generally consistent with Pb-210-defined surface mixed layer. This layer can be easily resuspended in the subsequent winter monsoon season and transported to the inner-shelf region in the Louth. Below the surface mixed layer, profiles of Pb-210 show exponential decrease with depth, which can be simply explained by constant sedimentation at each site on longer (decadal to centennial) time scales. The derived sedimentation rates in the study area vary from less than 0.11 g(.)cm(-2.)yr(-1) to over 1 g(.)cm(-2.)yr(-1). Being consistent with the topography and the current flow in the study area, the spatial pattern of sedimentation rate and nuclide inventories reveal the pathways of sediments and two areas of enhanced sedimentation. Results of this study suggest that the amount of Changjiang-derived sediments stored in the estuarine area and the Hangzhou Bay may be less than previously thought.

In 2015, delta O-18 and delta H-2 were integrated into a water quality survey in the Muskoka River Watershed with the aim to provide new regional-scale characterization of isotope hydrology in the 5,100-km(2) watershed located on the Canadian Shield in central Ontario, Canada. The forest dominated region includes similar to 78,000 ha of lakes, 42 water control structures, and 11 generating stations, categorized as "run of river." Within the watershed, stable isotope tracers have long been integrated into hydrologic process studies of both headwater catchments and lakes. Here, monthly surveys of delta O-18 and delta H-2 in river flow were conducted in the watershed between April 2015 and November 2016 (173 surface water samples from 10 river stations). Temporal patterns of stable isotopes in river water reflect seasonal influences of snowmelt and summer-time evaporative fractionation. Spatial patterns, including differences observed during extreme flood levels experienced in the spring of 2016, reflect variation in source contributions to river flow (e.g., snowmelt or groundwater versus evaporatively enriched lake storage), suggesting more local influences (e.g., glacial outwash deposits). Evidence of combined influences of source mixing and evaporative fractionation could, in future, support application of tracer-enabled hydrological modelling, estimation of mean transit times and, as such, contribute to studies of water quality and water resources in the region.					; James, April/D-1415-2012	Yao, Huaxia/0000-0001-5875-7215; Beaton, Andy/0000-0001-6827-4276; James, April Lynda/0000-0002-1741-5101													0885-6087	1099-1085				FEB 15	2020	34	4					914	926		10.1002/hyp.13664	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13664		DEC 2019											WOS:000504201000001
J	Svenning, MA; Gullestad, N				Svenning, MA; Gullestad, N			Adaptations to stochastic environmental variations: the effects of seasonal temperatures on the migratory window of Svalbard Arctic charr	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES					4th International Charr Symposium	JUN 25-JUL 01, 2000	TROIS RIVIERES, CANADA					The circumpolar Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, is ideal for studying how environmental factors affect life history in fishes. Charr populations demonstrate a tremendous ecological plasticity and adaptations to harsh environments. Arctic charr is the only freshwater fish on Svalbard, including anadromous, resident, and landlocked stocks. Freshwater lake systems on Svalbard are characterized by very low water temperatures, long-term or even permanent ice cover, and low levels of nutrients. Food is thus limited and may lead to growth stagnation and early maturity in Arctic charr. The individual growth pattern may alternatively follow a sigmoid-shaped curve, caused by a shift to either cannibalistic or anadromous (migration to sea) behaviour. In lake systems that include migratory charr, the population may consist of a mixture of parr, postsmolt, and adult migratory individuals, as well as small-sized resident, large-sized resident (cannibals), and large formerly resident individuals transformed to anadromy. Our study in the Lake Dieset watercourse (79degreesN), Svalbard, demonstrates that the annual water flow in the outlet river is strongly correlated to air temperatures and provides a passage to the sea, allowing the chart access to the nutrient-rich seawater environment, during at most two months each year. During one of the years studied, the youngest and small-sized part of the sea-going stock was prevented from ascending the river and probably suffered mortality during winter. The migratory window of the Arctic charr in Lake Dieset is therefore highly variable among years and thus unpredictable.

J	Ji, W; Jeske, C				Ji, W; Jeske, C			Spatial modeling of the geographic distribution of wildlife populations: a case study in the lower Mississippi River region	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A geographic information system (GIS)-based spatial modeling approach was developed to study environmental and land use impacts on the geographic distribution of wintering northern pintails (Anas acuta) in the Lower Mississippi River region. Pintails were fitted with backpack radio transmitter packages at Catahoula Lake, LA, in October 1992-1994 and located weekly through the following March. Pintail survey data were converted into a digital database in ARC/INFO GIS format and integrated with environmental GIS data through a customized modeling interface. The study verified the relationship between pintail distributions and major environmental factors and developed a conceptual relation model. Visualization-based spatial simulations were used to display the movement patterns of specific population groups under spatial and temporal constraints. The spatial modeling helped understand the seasonal movement patterns of pintails in relation to their habitat usage in Arkansas and southwestern Louisiana for wintering and interchange situations among population groups wintering in Texas and southeastern Louisiana.

J	Lukhele, T; Msagati, TAM				Lukhele, Thabile; Msagati, Titus Alfred Makudali			Eutrophication of Inland Surface Waters in South Africa: An Overview	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Eutrophication of fresh waterbodies is a global phenomenon that is exacerbated by increases in agricultural activities, industrialization, and urbanization, all driven by the global increase in human population. This paper reviews the state of inland waterbodies in South Africa, identifying the major drivers of eutrophication and discussing how different sectors of the economy are negatively impacted by eutrophication. Data indicate that up to 76% of major water impoundments and approximately 70% of major river systems are eutrophic to hypereutrophic and experience protracted periods of cyanobacterial blooms, particularly in the summer months. Negative impacts of eutrophication on the agricultural sector, potable water supply and tourism are well documented and are becoming more explicit. Evidently, nutrient loading patterns into water bodies have changed and become more complex. Although wastewater treatment plants remain the major contributors of nutrient loads to most waterbodies, non-point sources including agricultural runoff, untreated sewage from leaking and overflowing sewer systems, as well as runoff from informal settlements, also make substantial contributions. As a result, the strategies employed to prevent eutrophication, including within-waterbody remediation programs have fallen short in reducing the trophic status of water impoundments and thus ameliorating the symptoms of eutrophication. Tailor-made, integrated management initiatives that target point source, non-point source, and internal nutrient loads are, therefore, required.					; Msagati, Titus/A-7317-2013	Lukhele, Thabile/0000-0002-9166-9396; 													1735-6865	2008-2304				APR	2024	18	2							27	10.1007/s41742-024-00568-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41742-024-00568-8													WOS:001177490100002
J	Mehner, T				Mehner, T			Influence of spring warming on the predation rate of underyearling fish on Daphnia -: a deterministic simulation approach	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY					Workshop on Plankton Population Dynamics: Food Web Interactions and Abiotic Constraints	NOV, 1998	CONSTANCE, GERMANY					1. According to previous field studies in the biomanipulated Bautzen reservoir (Germany), a midsummer decline of the dominating zooplankter, Daphnia galeata, was suggested to be initiated by a simultaneous occurrence of low fecundity of the daphnids and a selective feeding of underyearling fish on mature daphnids. The timing of both processes was assumed to be triggered by spring water temperature. However, the field data were not appropriate for testing whether yearly differences in spring warming are strong enough to control the predation rate of underyearling fish on daphnids. 2. By combining field data on fish growth, feeding and population mortality, the daily uptake of Daphnia by a virtual population of underyearling perch (Perca fluviatilis) was simulated, in addition, the daily predatory mortality of mature daphnids was calculated independently. Scenarios with a warm and a cold spring were compared. Furthermore, the delayed warming of a pelagic zone of a lake versus a littoral one was simulated. Sensitivity of the simulation to changes in five parameters was tested. 3. In both the warm spring scenario and the littoral warming scenario, more daphnids in general and more mature daphnids in particular were eaten, compared with the cold spring and pelagic scenarios. The predatory mortality of mature daphnids was driven by the increasing gape size of growing fish such that in warmer years the fish reach earlier the size at which they can eat mature daphnids. 4. The simulation was most sensitive to changes in daily mortality rate of the fish and to the size at maturity of the daphnids. Since at least the fish mortality is also temperature-dependent via the growth rates of fish, the predation rate of perch on D. galeata in Bautzen reservoir is substantially increased during a warm spring. This underlines the assumption that even a slight global warming may have a decisive influence on food web processes due to the fine-scaled patterns of trophic interactions in lakes.

Organic phosphorus (OP) is a key factor in eutrophication. However, the mechanism and extent to which organic matter degradation affects P recycling in water column of large deep reservoirs are unclear, especially for the newly-built ones. In this study, different forms of carbon (C) and P in the water column of Hongjiadu Reservoir were investigated. The contents of particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate organic phosphorus (POP) both decreased with depth in summer, indicating that organic matter was degraded during the deposition of particulates. In contrast, the contents of POC and POP varied slightly with depth in winter. This difference may result from the double thermal stratification and the corresponding double oxygen stratification in summer. The POC/POP ratios were lower in the epilimnion and increased with depth, suggesting that P was preferentially regenerated relative to C during organic matter degradation. The contents of particulate inorganic phosphorus (PIP) and POP were significantly negatively correlated, indicating that POP transformed into PIP in deeper water. The double thermoclines and oxyclines in Hongjiadu Reservoir lead to very low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in the hypolimnion, which should receive sufficient attention. If water becomes hypoxic, enhanced P release during organic matter degradation will promote phytoplankton growth, leading to higher phytoplankton biomass and more severe DO depletion. Thus, a positive feedback loop may form among hypoxia, enhanced P release, higher primary productivity, and more severe hypoxia, accelerating P recycling in large deep reservoirs. Once if eutrophication occurs in these reservoirs, it will be very difficult to restore the water ecosystem. Thus, it is particularly important to prevent the occurrence of eutrophication and the formation of positive feedback loop as early as possible. This highlights the importance of both reducing external loading and improving DO level in large deep reservoirs.																			0301-4797	1095-8630				JUL 1	2020	265								110514	10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110514	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110514								32275242					WOS:000533526800010

ANNALS OF REGIONAL SCIENCE												This paper examines the relationship between hosting mega-events such as the Super Bowl, Olympics, and World Cup and rental housing prices in host cities. If mega-events are amenities for local residents, then rental housing prices can serve as a proxy for estimating residents' willingness to pay for these amenities. An analysis of rental prices in a panel of American cities from 1993 to 2005 fails to find a consistent impact of mega-events on rental prices. When controls are placed on the regression models to account for nationwide annual fluctuations in rental prices, mega-events generally exhibit little impact on rental prices in cities as a whole and are as likely to reduce rental prices as increase them. On the other hand, Somewhat stronger evidence exists, however, that mega-events tend to affect rental prices outside of the center city in a fundamentally different manner than in the city core. Atlanta experienced lower rental prices in the central city compared the suburbs both before and after the 1996 Summer Olympics while Salt Lake City witnessed an increase in rental prices in its central city compared to its suburbs before and after the 2002 Winter Olympics.

The result indicates that 1) the scouring amount in Jingjiang River made up 78.9% of the total from Yichang to Chenglingji, and its average scouring intensity was higher than the latter; 2) the water and sand diversion rates at the three outlets of the Jingjiang River were reduced by 2.33% and 2.78% separately; 3) the proportion of multi-year average runoff and sediment through the three outlets in the total into the Dongting Lake decreased by 7.7% and 24.4% respectively; 4) in Dongting Lake, the speed of sediment accumulation was lowered by 26.7%, in flood season, the runoff amount was 20.2% less than the multi-year average value, leading to seasonal scarcity of water year by year. The former prolonged the lake life, while the latter induced droughts in summer and fall in successive years, shortage of drinking and industrial water, shipping insecurity, as well as ecological problems such as decrease of birds and quick increase of Microtus fortis; 5) The multi-year average values of sediment and flood transporting capacity at the lake outlet were respectively increased by 26.6% and 3.7%, the embankments were protected effectively. Then, to adapt to the new change of the river-lake relation, some suggestions were put forward, such as optimizing further operation program of the Three Gorges Reservoir, reexamining the idea of river and lake regulation, and maintaining connection of the river and the lake.

Quantifying nutrient inputs by gulls to a fluctuating lake, aided by movement ecology methods	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems is a global problem with major ecological and economic impacts. In many lakes and reservoirs, guanotrophication occurs when roosting waterbirds import nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) from surrounding terrestrial habitats. To date, nutrient loading by waterbirds has been estimated based on censuses in the absence of detailed information on their movements. We quantified nutrient importation by the lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus) to Fuente de Piedra (1,350 ha) in Andalusia (south-west Spain), where an average of 36,288 individuals are counted in January. During seven winters from 2010 to 2017, we used movement data from 20 individual gulls tagged with Global Positioning System trackers that foraged in four landfills. Together with monthly bird counts and measurements of total N and P content in faeces and pellet samples, movement data were used to quantify the total external loading effect for different winters. Movement data allowed us to quantify the proportion of time spent in the lake and the time spent at different foraging sites and enabled correction of censuses. According to tracking data, on average 69% of the birds had already left the lake to head for feeding sites when waterbird counts were carried out. Nutrient inputs to the lake depend partly on the proportion of the day that gulls spend there, which was higher in late winters and was reduced when lake depth went below or above 20-35 cm. An estimated average of 10.17 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) and 2.07 kg P ha(-1) year(-1) were imported to this closed-basin lake by gulls each winter, with highest values recorded in winter 2016-2017. Gull guano is the most important winter source of nutrients to the lake. Regurgitated pellets have been ignored as a source of nutrients in other guanotrophy studies, but we found them to be a more important source of P than faeces. A movement ecology approach complements traditional censuses and facilitates the study of guanotrophication in multiple ways, including identification of sources of nutrients, correction of censuses, and measuring time spent at roost sites.

J	Mao, MH; Xia, M				Mao, Miaohua; Xia, Meng			Monthly and Episodic Dynamics of Summer Circulation in Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												A comprehensive understanding of lake circulation is fundamental to inform better management of ecological issues and fishery resources in the Great Lakes. In this study, a high-resolution, wave-current coupled, three-dimensional modeling system was applied to investigate the monthly and episodic dynamics of summer circulation in Lake Michigan. Model sensitivities to three wind sources and two grid resolutions against observed current velocities, water temperatures, and significant wave heights in the summer of 2014 were examined. Model performance was validated with additional satellite imageries and current measurements in the summer of 2015. Results indicated that the high-resolution model driven by the observation-based winds reproduced lake dynamics most reasonably. In July 2014, a pair of monthly averaged anticyclonic (i.e., clockwise) gyres in the surface layer were simulated in southern Lake Michigan. Analysis indicates that they originate from the wind-driven, upwelling-favorable, jet-like Ekman currents along the west shore, which are connected by the density-driven basin-scale circulation. Although river inputs, strait exchanges, waves, grid resolutions, and bathymetric variations influence the monthly surface circulation, their effects are less important than the wind and density-driven currents. Additional simulations support the predominant impacts of wind and density-driven currents on lake surface circulation during a strong wind event. Further investigations suggest that lake circulation varies from surface to bottom layers, and this knowledge is significant to the related ecological issues and fishery resources management. The numerical model configured to Lake Michigan is beneficial to understanding dynamics in the Great Lakes system and other large water bodies.					; Mao, Miaohua/AAQ-7734-2020	Mao, Miaohua/0000-0002-3013-4849; Mao, Miaohua/0000-0002-0605-4902													2169-9275	2169-9291				JUN	2020	125	6							e2019JC015932	10.1029/2019JC015932	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JC015932													WOS:000549832900031

However, a comprehensive investigation into the threedimensional (3-D) evolution characteristics of O3 within complicated urban environments, especially in lakeland environment, is notably scarce. To enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying elevated O3 concentrations within a 3-D scale, this study employed an ozone lidar to delineate vertical ozone profiles in Changzhou, a typical city in China with complicated anthropogenic and biogenic emissions and complex land cover. The process analysis tool integrated into the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRFChem) model was further utilized to analyze the formation processes of O3. The results unveil a persistent O3 pollution episode lasting over 15 days in Changzhou during the study period, with multiple peaks exceeding 200 mu g m-3. Notably, O3 predominantly accumulated within the boundary layer, confined below 1.2 km. Both ground and vertical contributions to this pollution were mainly due to local chemical reactions, with a maximum nearsurface contribution reaching 19 ppb h- 1 and a vertical contribution of 10 ppb h- 1 at the height of 900 +/- 200 m. Furthermore, episodes of the enhanced O3 concentrations on August 9 and August 26, 2021, were influenced by external advection process. Our study also found that local circulation plays an important role in the accumulation of surface O3 during certain periods. There was a temperature difference between the surface of Lake Tai and the adjacent land, resulting in the formation of lake-land breezes that facilitate the transport of O3 from the lake surface to the terrestrial environment during pollution events. Our study emphasizes the necessity of reducing local pollutant emissions and implementing joint emission controls as the primary strategies for mitigating O3 pollution in Changzhou and the surrounding region.					xiang, yan/M-3312-2018; Wang, Yuehui/AAC-9351-2021; Li, Li/AAE-9874-2021; xiang, yan/KIG-7705-2024	xiang, yan/0000-0003-3544-9134; Li, Li/0000-0001-5575-0894; 													0269-7491	1873-6424				OCT 15	2024	359								124556	10.1016/j.envpol.2024.124556	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2024.124556		JUL 2024						39025291					WOS:001275605000001

However, the effect of temperature fluctuation on phytoplankton is rarely considered. We analyzed the effect of fluctuating temperature on cyanobacterial dominance and blooms in spring (March-May) with long-term data analyses, laboratory simulation, and field observation. Our results showed that the magnitude of air temperature fluctuation in spring has increased in Lake Taihu over the past 58 years (1956-2013) and was negatively correlated with cyanobacterial blooms onset time (1987-2013). Air temperature fluctuation was one of the predictors of the best model for the variability in the bloom size in spring (2000-2011). The results from the field observation (2009-2013) also indicated that there was a positive correlation between diel air temperature difference and the ratio of cyanobacteria to total algae. Laboratory experiments suggested that water temperature fluctuation slowed the growth rates of Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Cyclotella meneghiniana but not Microcystis aeruginosa, which confirmed our findings of field observation and long-term data analysis. Therefore, the increased temperature fluctuation under global warming may promote cyanobacterial dominance. Our findings provide further understanding of inter-annual difference of cyanobacterial blooms onset time in the warming world.					yu, yang/HIZ-9682-2022	, Min/0000-0002-8130-5214													0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2016	763	1					135	146		10.1007/s10750-015-2368-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-015-2368-0													WOS:000365726600011

The vertical profile and seasonal fluctuation of nutrients are crucial to understanding the biogeochemical cycles in aquatic systems. In this study, field research was carried out at a small and shallow lake, Lake Bulan, in the lower Kharaa River basin. The area has been receiving increased nutrient loads from the water catchment area for the last 20 years. Water samples were collected seasonally from the lake from 2019-2022 and analyzed for nutrients, major cations, trace metals, and dissolved organic carbon. The average concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in the surface lake water had a wide seasonal variation from 0.26 +/- 0.11 mg N/L in August to 1.44 +/- 0.08 mg N/L in January. Seasonal differences were also observed in the vertical profiles. Concentrations were relatively similar at the various water depths in April and September at turnover time. Thermal stratification was observed when the lake was covered in ice, with the maximum concentrations being observed in the bottom layer in the months of January and August. The phosphate concentration showed a similar variation trend. These results indicate that both the summer and winter stratifications are important for regeneration of nutrients in the bottom layer, biochemical cycling, and mitigating impacts of global warming on small and shallow lakes in Mongolia.					; Fukushi, Keisuke/AAH-5202-2019; Fukushi, Keisuke/C-4827-2015; Gankhurel, Baasansuren/D-6268-2016	Munkhsuld, Enkhuur/0000-0001-9134-7269; Nagao, Seiya/0000-0002-1709-9225; Davaasuren, Davaadorj/0000-0001-9638-6793; Fukushi, Keisuke/0000-0003-0398-8950; Ochir, Altansukh/0000-0001-7903-8594; Gankhurel, Baasansuren/0000-0002-9371-6168														2073-4441				JUN	2022	14	12							1916	10.3390/w14121916	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14121916													WOS:000817603100001
J	Gu, HP; Ma, ZG; Li, MX				Gu, Hongping; Ma, Zhuguo; Li, Mingxing			Effect of a large and very shallow lake on local summer precipitation over the Lake Taihu basin in China	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Lake Taihu is the third largest freshwater lake in China and is situated in the Middle and lower Yangtze River delta. It is characterized by its shallowness (similar to 1.9m), large area (similar to 2338km(2)), and high turbidity in recent years. The lake's effect on local summer precipitation is first studied in this paper through the use of an atmosphere-lake coupled model. By enlarging the light extinction coefficient, modifying the radiation scheme, and setting the roughness length to constants, the coupled model after adjustment realistically reproduces the thermal stratification and magnitude of diurnal variation over Lake Taihu, with mean biases of 0.7 degrees C for lake surface temperature and 0.4 degrees C for near-surface air temperature, respectively. Based on this calibrated coupled model, two high-resolution numerical simulations with and without the lake (lake grid cells replaced by cropland) were conducted to identify the lake effects. The results show that an overall effect of Lake Taihu on local summer precipitation is negative during daytime and positive during nighttime and the precipitation pattern may be modified to some extent. The lake effect varies between areas and with time of day and occurs primarily on the downwind shore. A composite analysis for a representative decreased precipitation region reveals that during daytime in the summer, the combination of decreased air temperature and latent heat flux, along with intensified divergence and downdraft, acts together to stabilize the lower atmosphere and suppress thermal convective activities, ultimately resulting in less precipitation over this region.					gu, hongping/AAD-7586-2019; Li, 李明星/AAJ-6084-2020														2169-897X	2169-8996				AUG 16	2016	121	15					8832	8848		10.1002/2015JD024098	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015JD024098													WOS:000383372400006

This work investigated therefore the physicochemical and water quality parameters of Hulun Lake, and that of the inflowing Crulen River and Orshen River through winter, to reveal the spatial and temporal characteristics of water quality without impact of algal bloom, atmospheric deposition, wind or allochthonous nutrient input. Results showed that the prevention of wind-induced sedimentary resuspension accompanied with the minimized volume of tributary inflows is supposed to predominate the eutrophication alleviation. The formation of ice cover had a slight concentrative effect on water ion content. However, ice cover resulted in an increasingly homogenous distribution of phosphorus and oxygen-depleting organic matter over the entire lake. The two headwater streams demonstrated limited impact on water quality in estuaries in winter without showing evident coordination in upstream water nutrient level. It is suggested that the prevention of wind disturbance by ice cover and the subsequently modified hydrodynamic and water ecological processes are the determinant factors on water quality in Hulun Lake during winter.

J	Whitlock, C; Sarna-Wojcicki, AM; Bartlein, PJ; Nickmann, RJ				Whitlock, C; Sarna-Wojcicki, AM; Bartlein, PJ; Nickmann, RJ			Environmental history and tephrostratigraphy at Carp Lake, southwestern Columbia Basin, Washington, USA	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY					9th International Palynological Congress	JUN 23-28, 1996	HOUSTON, TX					Sediment cores from Carp Lake provide a pollen record of the last ca. 125,000 years that helps disclose vegetational and climatic conditions from the present day to the previous interglaciation (120-133 ka). The core also contained 15 tephra layers, which were characterised by electron-microprobe analysis of volcanic glass shards. Identified tephra include Mount St. Helens Ye, 3.69 ka; Mazama ash bed, 7.54 ka; Mount St, Helens layer C, 35-50 ka; an unnamed Mount St. Helens tephra, 75-150 ka; the tephra equivalent of layer E at Pringle Falls, Oregon, <218 ka; and an andesitic tephra layer similar to that at Tulelake, California, 174 ka, Ten calibrated radiocarbon ages and the ages of Mount St. Helens Ye, Mazama ash, and the unnamed Mount St, Helens tephra were used to develop an age-depth model. This model was refined by also incorporating the age of marine oxygen isotope stage (IS) boundary 4/5 (73.9 ka) and the age of IS-Se (125 ka). The justification for this age-model is based on an analysis of the pollen record and lithologic data. The pollen record is divided into 11 assemblage zones that describe alternations between periods of montane conifer forest, pine forest, and steppe. The previous interglacial period (IS-5e) supported temperate xerothermic forests of pine and oak and a northward and westward expansion of steppe and juniper woodland, compared to their present occurrence. The period from 83 to 117 ka contains intervals of pine forest and parkland alternating with pine-spruce forest, suggesting shifts from cold humid to cool temperate conditions. Between 73 and 83 ka, a forest of oak, hemlock, Douglas-fir, and fir was present that has no modem analogue. It suggests warm wet summers and cool wet winters. Cool humid conditions during the mid-Wisconsin interval supported mixed conifer forest with Douglas-fir and spruce. The glacial interval featured cold dry steppe, with an expansion of spruce in the late-glacial. Xerothermic communities prevailed in the early Holocene, when temperate steppe was widespread and the lake dried intermittently. The middle Holocene was characterised by ponderosa pine forest, and the modern vegetation was established in the last 3900 yr, when ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, fir, and oak were part of the local vegetation.

The high sensitivity of phytoplankton to changes in these factors makes it possible to control the state of the ecosystem of water bodies. Artificial lakes often demonstrate increased trophic status, inducing changes in phytoplankton structure. In this paper, we studied phytoplankton in June 2023 (hydrological spring) in two ecosystems, South Baikal and the Irkutsk Reservoir, that are connected by a water course but have different environmental parameters. The gradient of environmental parameters from the lake towards the reservoir revealed peculiarities in the distribution of some microalgae species. Microscopy and statistical analysis showed that water temperature was the most important factor affecting the structure of the communities. The warmer water of the reservoir, in contrast to the lake, demonstrated a twofold increase in species number, abundance, and biomass. Downstream from the reservoir, we observed a succession in the dominating Baikal species complex, its supplementation, and replacement with other species typical of the summer period and Baikal bays. The trophic status of the reservoir during the study may be described as oligotrophic, with local traits of mesotrophicity; its water refers to Class I and Class II and may be qualified as clean.

A variety of lake types and environmental settings provided an opportunity to compare temporal changes in water quality and the structure and organization of plankton assemblages among seven lakes with different watershed characteristics and geographical positions. Two lakes were geographically isolated, while the others were connected by streams, forming a three-lake chain and two-lake chain in two different watersheds. The results supported the general hypothesis that the ecological properties of the lakes were closely related to their corresponding watershed characteristics and that biological similarities among lakes were inversely related to differences in morphology, hydrology, geology, elevation and location. Most lakes exhibited increases in temperature, alkalinity, conductivity and phytoplankton and zooplankton densities between July and August. In general, temperature, alkalinity, conductivity, phytoplankton and zooplankton densities increased with decreasing elevation in the two groups of connected lakes. Structure of phytoplankton assemblages was associated with lake depth and nitrate concentration, while the distribution of crustacean zooplankton corresponded to elevation and conductivity.																			0003-9136					JUL	1995	134	1					75	92																WOS:A1995RJ33500004

The influence of environmental conditions on the seasonal variation of Microcystis cell density and microcystins concentration in San Francisco Estuary	HYDROBIOLOGIA												A bloom of the cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa was sampled over the summer and fall in order to determine if the spatial and temporal patterns in cell density, chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration, total microcystins concentration, and percent microcystins composition varied with environmental conditions in San Francisco Estuary. It was hypothesized that the seasonal variation in Microcystis cell density and microcystin concentration was ecologically important because it could influence the transfer of toxic microcystins into the aquatic food web. Sampling for Microcystis cell density, chl a concentration, total microcystins concentration and a suite of environmental conditions was conducted biweekly at nine stations throughout the freshwater tidal and brackish water regions of the estuary between July and November 2004. Total microcystins in zooplankton and clam tissue was also sampled in August and October. Microcystis cell density, chl a concentration and total microcystins concentration varied by an order of magnitude and peaked during August and September when P-m(B) and alpha(B) were high. Low streamflow and high water temperature were strongly correlated with the seasonal variation of Microcystis cell density, total microcystins concentration (cell)(-1) and total microcystins concentration (chl a)(-1) in canonical correlation analyses. Nutrient concentrations and ratios were of secondary importance in the analysis and may be of lesser importance to seasonal variation of the bloom in this nutrient rich estuary. The seasonal variation of Microcystis density and biomass was potentially important for the structure and function of the estuarine aquatic food web, because total microcystins concentration was high at the base of the food web in mesozooplankton, amphipod, clam, and worm tissue during the peak of the bloom.

J	MALM, J; ZILITINKEVICH, S				MALM, J; ZILITINKEVICH, S			TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION AND CURRENT SYSTEM IN A CONVECTIVELY MIXED LAKE	BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY												During spring and autumn, many lakes in temperate latitudes experience intensive convective mixing in the vertical, which leads to almost isothermal conditions with depth. Thus the regime of turbulence appears to be similar with that characteristic of convective boundary layers in the atmosphere. In the present paper a simple analytical approach, based on boundary-layer theory, is applied to convective conditions in lakes. The aims of the paper are firstly to analyze in detail the temperature distribution during these periods, and secondly to investigate the current system, created by the horizontal temperature gradient and wind action. For these purposes, simple analytical solutions for the current velocities are derived under the assumption of depth-constant temperatures. The density-induced current velocities are shown to be small, in the order of a few mm/sec. The analytical model of wind-driven currents is compared with field data. The solution is in good qualitative agreement with observed current velocities under the condition that the wind field is steady for a relatively long time and that residual effects from former wind events are negligible. The effect of the current system on an approximately depth-constant temperature distribution is then checked by using the obtained current velocity fields in the heat transfer equation and deriving an analytical solution for the corrected temperature field. These temperature corrections are shown to be small, which indicates that it is reasonable to describe the temperature distribution with vertical isotherms.

J	Peng, XT; Jones, B				Peng, Xiaotong; Jones, Brian			Patterns of biomediated CaCO3 crystal bushes in hot spring deposits	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												In the Eiyuan hot spring, located in south China, the vent pool is covered with "crystal bushes", up to 2 cm high, 1 cm in diameter, that grew in the biofilms that thrive in the spring waters that have a pH of 7.5 and a temperature of 88 degrees C. The biofilms are formed largely of phototrophic purple bacteria and green bacteria. Growth of the crystal bushes, which are formed of aragonite crystals (wheat-sheaves, radiating clusters), rhombohedral and dodecahedral calcite crystals, amorphous CaCO3 (ACC), and opal-A, is attributed to precipitation in the micro-domains of the biofilms where physiochemical conditions can vary on the sub-micron scale. There is no evidence that the calcite was formed through recrystallization of the metastable aragonite and most of the calcite crystals developed as mesocrystals that are characterized by incomplete growth and porous crystal faces. With the onset of diagenesis, there is a high probability that the crystal bushes will lose much of their identity as the (1) biofilm is lost through decay, (2) ACC and aragonite change to calcite, (3) identities of the mesocrystals and incompletely formed crystals are lost through continued precipitation and/or recrystallization, and (4) porous crystal faces are converted to solid crystal faces. This means that most of the features considered indicative of biomediated calcite precipitation have a low preservation potential and that the recognition of biomediated precipitates in old spring deposits may remain problematical.

Although a comprehensive restoration strategy for this species was recently drafted by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, a lack of current data on Great Lakes sturgeon stocks has hindered rehabilitation efforts. Historically, the Detroit River supported one of the largest lake sturgeon populations in the Great Lakes; however, little is known about the current population or its habitat use. The main objective of this study was to determine if lake sturgeon spawns in the Detroit River. As part of a larger study, baited setlines were used to capture lake sturgeon in the Detroit River in the spring and summer of 2000 and 2001. In each year of the study, ultrasonic transmitters were surgically implanted in 10 adult fish to track their movements, evaluate habitat use and identify possible spawning sites. Using telemetry and egg mats to verify spawning activity, one spawning site was located and verified in the Detroit River. Spawning was verified by recovering sturgeon eggs deposited on egg collection mats anchored at the site. Telemetry data suggested that several other possible spawning sites also may exist, however, spawning activity was not verified at these sites.																			0175-8659					FEB	2004	20	1					1	6		10.1111/j.1439-0426.2004.00499.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.2004.00499.x													WOS:000188824300001
J	Wagner, C; Adrian, R				Wagner, Carola; Adrian, Rita			Exploring lake ecosystems: hierarchy responses to long-term change?	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Shifts in climate regime have provoked substantial trophic- and species-dependent changes within ecosystems. With growing concerns of present global warming, we examined potential lake ecosystem responses, natural hierarchy responses (i.e. immediate responses at lower system levels as opposed to delayed responses at higher system levels), and possible shifts among abiotic (physics, nutrients) and biotic (phytoplankton, zooplankton) system components. Specifically, we analyzed decadal data collected from Muggelsee, a lake in Berlin, Germany, for climate-induced abiotic and biotic changes, their timing and type, and classified them as abrupt permanent, gradual permanent, abrupt temporary, or monotonic. We further categorized variable changes as a function of system hierarchy, including lake physics (ice, temperature, stratification), nutrients (phosphorus, nitrogen, silicate), plankton, and levels of integration (i.e. species, taxonomic groups, and total plankton). Contrary to current theory, data suggest abrupt responses did not occur in a hierarchy-dependent manner, nor was a clear pattern observed among functional system-based categories. Abrupt permanent changes were the most prominent response pattern observed, suggesting they may be driven by large-scale climatic oscillations and by surpassed thresholds, as noted in previous case studies. Gradual changes coincided with affected abiotic parameters spanning an expansive time range; for example, climatic effects in spring preceded changes in nutrient limitation. Variables displaying no long-term changes pointed to compensation processes caused by, e.g., simultaneously acting forces of warming trends and climate-independent changes in trophic state. Nevertheless, the complexity of response patterns at the single system level manifested clear chronological regime shifts in abiotic and biotic parameters in spring and, to a lesser extent, in summer. With regard to projected global warming, the majority of currently unaffected system levels may face impending thermal thresholds, achievement of which would result in an accelerated shift in ecosystem state.

Multispecies fish tracking across newly created shallow and deep habitats in a forward-restored lake	MOVEMENT ECOLOGY												BackgroundFreshwater fish communities typically thrive in heterogenous ecosystems that offer various abiotic conditions. However, human impact increasingly leads to loss of this natural heterogeneity and its associated rich fish communities. To reverse this trend, we need guidelines on how to effectively restore or recreate habitats for multiple fish species. Lake Markermeer in the Netherlands is a human-created 70,000-ha lake with a uniform 4 m-water depth, steep shorelines, high wind-induced turbidity, and a declining fish community. In 2016, a forward-looking restoration project newly created a 1000-ha five-island archipelago in this degrading lake, which offered new sheltered shallow waters and deep sand excavations to the fish community.MethodsIn 2020, we assessed how omnivorous and piscivorous fish species used these new habitats by tracking 78 adult fish of five key species across local and lake-scales. We monitored spring arrival of adult fish and assessed local macro-invertebrate and young-of-the-year fish densities.ResultsAdult omnivorous Cyprinidae and piscivorous Percidae arrived at the archipelago in early spring, corresponding with expected spawning movements. During the productive summer season, 12 species of young-of-the-year fish appeared along the sheltered shorelines, with particularly high densities of common roach (Rutilus rutilus) and European perch (Perca fluviatilis). This suggests the sheltered, shallow, vegetated waters formed new suitable spawning and recruitment habitat for the fish community. Despite highest food densities for adult fish in the shallowest habitats (< 2-m), adult fish preferred minimally 2-m deep water. After spawning most Cyprinidae left the archipelago and moved long distances through the lake system, while most Percidae remained resident. This may be related to (1) high densities of young-of-the-year fish as food for piscivores, (2) medium food densities for omnivores compared to elsewhere in the lake-system, or (3) the attractiveness of 30-m deep sand excavations that were newly created and frequently used by one-third of all tracked fish.ConclusionsNew littoral zones and a deep sand excavation constructed in a uniform shallow lake that lacked these habitat types attracted omnivorous and piscivorous fish species within four years. Both feeding guilds used the littoral zones for reproduction and nursery, and notably piscivorous fish became residents year-round.

Thus, it is very important to continuously monitor the water temperature. We previously proposed the use of acoustic tomography to monitor the water temperature in Lake Biwa. In autumn, a thermocline develops in Lake Biwa. During this season, the water temperature changes considerably between the warm surface and the cold bottom of the lake, and a circular current develops when the thermocline is formed. It is necessary to ascertain the relationship between the thermocline and the speed of sound. In this study, to determine the relationship between the speed of sound and the water temperature when a thermocline exists, the speed of sound was measured in the north of the lake in autumn 2008. We report the estimated water temperature and the measured speed of sound in Lake Biwa. The speed of sound measured directly was greater than the calculated value for pure water. The existence of the thermocline was also verified at the same time, in which the water temperature changed by about 7.5 degrees C from the lake surface to a depth of 20 m. The estimated water temperature of the lake assuming nonsaline water was about 0.2 to about 0.5 degrees C higher than the measured water temperature. To improve the accuracy of the estimated water temperature, the temperature was corrected using a salinity conversion value, which was calculated from the speed of sound measured in situ. The salinity conversion value was used to estimate the water temperature from the speed of sound measured directly in situ in Lake Biwa within an accuracy of 0.1 degrees C.

Five hundred and forty-one drownings (2.1 per 100,000 person-years) were identified from death certificates and from incident reports filed with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Most drownings (334, 62 percent) occurred during summer months (May-August) and involved boating (42 percent) and swimming (35 percent) events. However, 62 drownings (11 percent) occurred during winter months (December-February) and primarily involved snowmobiles and motor vehicles (71 percent) breaking through ice on lakes and waterways. The risk of drowning, estimated by the ratio of drownings to number of water-related activities, was highest during March and April, when the ice on lakes and waterway surfaces is melting, and during October and November, the lake and waterway surfaces are starting to freeze. Drowning rates were highest for males (3.7 per 100,000 person-years), persons 15 to 25 years of age (3.3 per 100,000 person-years), and children less than 5 years of age (2.5 per 100,000 person-years).

Seasonal and regional variations in metal contamination and condition indicators in yellow perch (Perca flavescens) along two polymetallic gradients.: III.: Energetic and physiological indicators	HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT												The influences of metal contamination, fish size, season, and region on tissue metabolic capacities and protein concentrations were examined in yellow perch from two metal gradients (Sudbury, Ontario, and Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, Canada) in two seasons (spring and summer). In general, increased tissue Cu and Cd contamination was associated with lower aerobic capacities, suggesting direct metal inhibition of aerobic enzymes. However, our data also revealed that tissue Ni contamination positively affected aerobic capacities, possibly due to oxidative damage to mitochondrial membranes leading to compensatory increases in the activity of mitochondrial enzymes. Tissue aerobic capacities decreased, but anaerobic capacities increased, with size. Tissue protein concentrations and metabolic capacities were also influenced by season. A novel finding of this study is that size-corrected tissue enzyme activities can differ markedly in yellow perch sampled in the same season in similar lakes, but separated by a few hundred kilometers. Overall, the results from this large dataset support that tissue metabolic capacities are under seasonal and regional influences, but are also affected by metal contamination. Our study indicates that tissue metabolic enzyme activities should be considered as a tool for ecological risk assessment studies aiming at detecting metal stress in wild fish. However, fish should be sampled over a short period, and reference sites should be close to contaminated sites.

In lake waters with the original pH varying from 4.3 to 6.2, any decrease or increase in acidity decreased primary production, chlorophyll-a, phytoplankton biomass and species richness, as well as community gross production and respiration. Similar trends were observed in dark fixation of inorganic carbon and densities of bacteria. No marked differences were found in the response of organisms between clear and humic lakes. Most of the prevailing algae, e.g. Isthmochloron trispinatum, Chrysococcus rufescens and Cryptomonas cf. marssonii, remained most abundant at the original pH. Few species, Glenodinium sp., Asterionella ralfsii and Chlamydomonas spp., showed tolerance of acidity. Rapid changes in pH seem to affect the metabolism of phytoplankton and bacteria very rapidly, and aquatic microorganisms seem to be closely adjusted to the prevailing acidity. Instead, major changes in community structure take a longer time, extending over the one week period used in these experiments.

J	MORTIMER, CH				MORTIMER, CH			DISCOVERIES AND TESTABLE HYPOTHESES ARISING FROM COASTAL ZONE COLOR SCANNER IMAGERY OF SOUTHERN LAKE-MICHIGAN	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												CZCS (Coastal Zone Color Scanner) images, confined mainly to the southern basin of Lake Michigan during the warm-up phases of 1979, 1980, and 1981, have furnished tools for synoptic reconnaissance of the wind-perturbed transition of the thermal regime in large basins from the winter to summer condition (including front formation and upwelling events), the coupling of phytoplankton growth with that transition,the intermittent mobilization and surface transport of sediment resuspended by storms, and the extensive temporary trapping of river-derived dissolved organic matter (gelbstoff) between the shoreline and the offshore-migrating thermal front. Intermittent resuspension of particles and varible inputs of gelbstoff, which occur in many coastal waters, render inapplicable the CZCS algorithms successfully used in ocean studies for atmospheric correction and for quantification of phytoplankton chlorophyll. That disappointment notwithstanding, there is a favorable match of the coverage and scene-revisit frequency of the CZCS and the space and time scales of significant features of the above-listed processes. The observed pattern changes shed new light on the above processes and generate several testable conjectures. These relate to whole-basin sediment transport, coastal upwelling of near-bottom sediment suspensions, and frontal hydrodynamics and its coupling with phytoplankton distributions.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	1988	33	2					203	226		10.4319/lo.1988.33.2.0203	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1988.33.2.0203													WOS:A1988N101700004

This density increase generates forced convection and subsequent movement of cold water along the underwater slope to maximum depths. Cooling of deep and near-bottom waters caused by forced convection is compensated during other seasons of the year by eddy heat flux directed toward the bottom. On a long-term basis, vertical temperature profiles in deep waters remain constant.

J	Gunes, K; Tuncsiper, B				Gunes, Kemal; Tuncsiper, Bilal			A serially connected sand filtration and constructed wetland system for small community wastewater treatment	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												In this study, a newly developed combined natural wastewater treatment system was used for the first time in the Village of Ileydagi, which has a population of 313 situated in the reservoir of Lake Egirdir, the second largest freshwater lake in Turkey. The combined treatment system consists of a combination of buried sand filtration (BSF) and buried subsurface flow constructed wetland (BSSF-CW) systems. The total area of the BSF system is 582 m(2) and that of the BSSF-CW system is 1352 m(2). Performance of the combined treatment system was 5% higher during the summer period than during the winter months. The average removal values of the combined system observed for a 14-month period were as follows: Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) 97%, total nitrogen (TN) 85%, and total phosphorus (TP) 69%. There is a strong correlation (0.81-0.97) between the loading and removal rates (g/m(2) d). This correlation is also statistically important. The results indicate that the novel sand filtration and constructed wetland treatment system is an optimal solution to the wastewater problems of small settlements. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we analyzed the branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) from a lacustrine sediment core from Qionghai Lake to reconstruct the paleoclimatology of southwestern subtropical China over the past 27.7 kyr. Our results suggest that the brGDGTs in Qionghai Lake sediments were probably sourced from catchment soils, with some contributions from in situ lacustrine production. We found that the temperature of the Last Glacial Maximum and Holocene Climatic Optimum was similar to 3 degrees C cooler and similar to 2.5 degrees C warmer than present-day conditions, respectively, based on brGDGTs-reconstructed mean annual air temperatures (MATs). Generally, temperature and precipitation showed synchronous paleovariability in ISM regions. Moreover, Northern Hemisphere summer insolation was the dominant control on climate variability in ISM regions on the precessional scale, while Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation activity, Intertropical Convergence Zone positioning, and glacial boundary conditions (ice sheet extent and sea surface temperature) contributed to climate shifts on millennial timescales.

In this work, the two lakes as well as springs and rivers that represent their potential source waters are characterized physio-chemically and isotopically, using a combination of environmental tracers. Temperature and pH were measured and water samples were analyzed for alkalinity, major ion concentration, and stable isotope (delta H-2, delta O-18, delta C-13 of dissolved inorganic carbon, and delta S-34 and delta O-18 of sulfate) composition. Chemical data were also investigated in terms of local meteorological data (air temperature, precipitation) to determine the sensitivity of lake parameters to changes in the surrounding environment. Groundwater represented by samples taken from Santa Susanna Spring was shown to be distinct with SO42- and Mg2+ content of 270 and 29 mg/L, respectively, and heavy sulfate isotopic composition (delta S-34 = 15.2 parts per thousand and delta O-18 = 10 parts per thousand). Outflow from the Santa Susanna Spring enters Lake Ripasottile via a canal and both spring and lake water exhibits the same chemical distinctions and comparatively low seasonal variability. Major ion concentrations in Lake Lungo are similar to the Vicenna Riara Spring and are interpreted to represent the groundwater locally recharged within the plain. The delta C-13(DIC) exhibit the same groupings as the other chemical parameters, providing supporting evidence of the source relationships. Lake Lungo exhibited exceptional ranges of delta C-13(DIC) (+/- 5 parts per thousand) and delta H-2, delta O-18 (+/- 5 parts per thousand and +/- 7 parts per thousand, respectively), attributed to sensitivity to seasonal changes. The hydrochemistry results, particularly major ion data, highlight how the two lakes, though geographically and morphologically similar, represent distinct hydrochemical facies. These data also show a different response in each lake to temperature and precipitation patterns in the basin that may be attributed to lake water retention time. The sensitivity of each lake to meteorological patterns can be used to understand the potential effects from long-term climate variability.

J	Wood, GD				Wood, Gillen D'Arcy			The Volcano That Spawned a Monster: Frankenstein and Climate Change	HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY												The volcanic period of 1816-18 is the most recent and vivid case study we have for worldwide climate catastrophe, evident from archival and geological records of sustained extreme weather, including drought, floods, storms, and crop-killing temperature decline. The signature literary expression of this historic climate crisis occurred in Switzerland, where teenage Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein in the midst of the disastrous "Year without a Summer," 1816, a season of floods and food riots caused by the eruption of Mount Tambora thousands of miles away. This essay, combining climate science with historical and literary sources, reexamines the literary legend of that direful, stormy summer, which Mary Shelley spent on the shores of Lake Geneva with the poets Percy Shelley and Lord Byron, with a new and original emphasis on its climatic context. The writers huddled indoors and wrote ghost stories, while the cataclysmic weather and humanitarian emergency unfolding around them weaved its way into Mary Shelley's imagining of a tragic monster brought to life.																			0018-7895	1544-399X				WIN	2020	83	4					691	703																WOS:000643568500003
J	Allende, L; Izaguirre, I				Allende, L; Izaguirre, I			The role of physical stability on the establishment of steady states in the phytoplankton community of two Maritime Antarctic lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Two Antarctic lakes near Hope Bay were studied during summers 1998 and 1999. One of the lakes (Boeckella) is located near Esperanza Station and exhibits a meso-eutrophic condition due to the input of nutrients of a nearby penguin rookery. Its surface generally remains ice-free during the Antarctic summer ( December - March). The other lake (Chico) is situated on the Mount Flora shelf, is typically oligotrophic and its surface is ice-free only during brief periods in the summer season. The difference in the duration of the ice-cover insures that the wind mixes the former lake continuously throughout the summer, while the latter remains almost always stratified. X-2, X-3 and Z functional groups defined by Reynolds dominated phytoplankton in both lakes. In Lake Boeckella, Chlamydomonas spp. followed by Ochromonas sp. were the most frequently encountered taxa in the nano-phytoplankton fraction, however the latter species was dominant when the lake froze. In Lake Chico, the major contribution to this fraction was due to different genera of flagellated Chrysophyceae (Ochromonas sp., Chromulina spp., cf. Chrysidalis). In terms of density and biomass in both lakes picocyanobacteria represented a large proportion of the phytoplankton. Probably due to the typically low algal biodiversity of Antarctic lakes, both water bodies showed periods of more than 2 weeks when a maximum of only three species comprised more than 80% of the standing crop. In spite of this, Chico Lake was the only one in which no significant change was recorded in total biomass. Thus, we were able to identify equilibrium phases in the latter lake, which were confirmed by a low coefficient of variation. The presence of an almost permanent ice cover in Chico Lake generated more stable ecological conditions, allowing the development of steady state assemblages. On the contrary, the wind influence in the shallow Antarctic ice free lake (Lake Boeckella) provided continuous mixing events, disrupting the possibility of establishing a steady state.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	2003	502	1-3					211	224		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000004283.11230.4a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000004283.11230.4a													WOS:000186636900018

Their adaptation in response to environmental stressors, particularly mitigating the impact of pollutants discharged from human activities, has been considered for the development of microbial biomonitoring tools, but their use is still in the infancy. Here, chemical and molecular (16S rRNA gene metabarcoding) approaches were combined in order to determine the impact of pollutants on microbial assemblages inhabiting the aquatic network of a soil-water-sediment continuum around the Ichkeul Lake (Tunisia), an area highly impacted by human activities. Samples were collected within the soil-river-lake continuum at three stations in dry (summer) and wet (winter) seasons. The contaminant pressure index (PI), which integrates Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), alkanes, Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and metal contents, and the microbial pressure index microgAMBI, based on bacterial community structure, showed significant correlation with contamination level and differences between seasons. The comparison of prokaryotic communities further revealed specific assemblages for soil, river and lake sediments. Correlation analyses identified potential "specialist" genera for the different compartments, whose abundances were correlated with the pollutant type found. Additionally, PICRUSt analysis revealed the metabolic potential for pollutant transformation or degradation of the identified "specialist" species, providing information to estimate the recovery capacity of the ecosystem. Such findings offer the possibility to define a relevant set of microbial indicators for assessing the effects of human activities on aquatic ecosystems. Microbial indicators, including the detection of "specialist" and sensitive taxa, and their functional capacity, might be useful, in combination with integrative microbial indices, to constitute accurate biomonitoring tools for the management and restoration of complex coastal aquatic systems.					; Duran, Robert/F-1521-2011; MAHMOUDI, Ezzeddine/ISS-6035-2023; Cagnon, Christine/B-8874-2013; Lanzén, Anders/AAG-5048-2019; Coulon, Frederic/B-3227-2009; Borja, Angel/I-3665-2018	Atai, Emmanuel/0000-0001-6433-7495; Cagnon, Christine/0000-0003-0622-8754; Coulon, Frederic/0000-0002-4384-3222; Bourhane, Zeina/0000-0002-9663-2584; Borja, Angel/0000-0003-1601-2025													0304-3894	1873-3336				JAN 5	2022	421								126789	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126789	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126789		AUG 2021						34365235					WOS:000696903300002
J	YOUNG, BF; RUFF, RL				YOUNG, BF; RUFF, RL			POPULATION-DYNAMICS AND MOVEMENTS OF BLACK BEARS IN EAST CENTRAL ALBERTA	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Demographic and spatial parameters of a high-density black bear (U. americanus) population were studied with radiotelemetry and live-capture techniques in 1974 and 1975 at Cold Lake, Alberta. During previous studies, the population on a 218-km2 study area closed to sport hunting of bears had doubled from a mean of 80 bears in 1968-1971, to 175 in 1973 following the removal of 23 adult males in 1971 and 1972. The increase was attributed to increased subadult survival and ingress. By 1975 the population decreased to 137 and the adult male cohort was numerically restored. The subadult cohort remained large. Average weights of bears of the same age did not decrease when the population increased, suggesting that food was not in short supply at the higher densities. Size estimates for annual home range of males and females averaged 119 and 19.6 km2, respectively. Size of male home ranges was not affected by the density increase, but the size of female home ranges may have decreased. Areas occupied by 24 male bears of different ages overlapped extensively. Adult females appeared to be territorial toward one another, but tolerated bears of other sexes and ages. Mobility of male bears decreased from spring through fall and was likely influenced by seasonal food availability and breeding behavior. More subadult males moved off the study area than adult males. Male bears selected aspen and garbage dump areas but avoided muskeg habitat. Subadult males were located at garbage dumps twice as often as adult males.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1982	46	4					845	860		10.2307/3808217	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3808217													WOS:A1982PR27500001

The zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) is one of the most successful invasive species; it has colonised many aquatic systems in Europe and North America with strong impacts on various ecosystem processes. The effect of D. polymorpha filtration on pelagic seston concentrations has been quantified in several studies, but the magnitude and stoichiometry of the transfer of sestonic biomass into benthic detritus by D. polymorpha and the accompanying enrichment of the benthic habitat is still under-investigated. 2. We studied biodeposition by zebra mussels in two series of laboratory experiments with the food algae Cryptomonas erosa and Scenedesmus obliquus. We also measured the year-round biodeposition rate under natural conditions in the oligotrophic Lake Constance. 3. In all experiments, zebra mussel biodeposition was linearly related to seston concentration. In the field, the relationship changed with a seasonal shift in algal composition and lower biodeposition rates during the spring algal bloom. 4. For both algal species in laboratory experiments, biodeposited material was depleted in phosphorous at an algal concentration <= 0.6 mg ash-free dry mass L(-1), but not at higher concentrations. This effect was not observed in the field, probably because of high variation in C : N : P stoichiometry. 5. By mediating the transfer of pelagic resources into the benthos zebra mussels provide a sufficient amount of detritus for benthic invertebrates, especially during summer. Thus, material biodeposited by the mussels might increase benthic secondary production from pelagic resources, and zebra mussels are important mediators of this flux of organic matter from the pelagic zone into the benthos.

Study focus: Temporal and spatial water chemistry variation and stable isotopic composition has been investigated in two sampling campaigns in wet and dry seasons. Novelties relating to these Lakes are that for the first time, depth and temporal dependent samples were studied chemically and isotopically. Water samples from various depths of the lakes and drainage water were analyzed for main ions, trace and semi-metals as well as sulfur and water isotopes. Data were interpreted statistically and with the chemical-thermodynamic code PHREEQC. New hydrological insights for the region: Processes in the lakes are similar, resulting from rain and groundwater infiltrating the rocks and mine residues and leaching efflorescent salts. Differences result from the lakes' depth, altitude, and source of inflow. They cause the Blue Lake to be in the Al- and the Yellow and Purple Lakes in the Fe-buffer-range. These lakes' characteristics result either in stratification, evaporation influence or a well-mixed pit lake identified by the isotope variability. Isotope results further identified bacterial sulfate reduction throughout the lake water column during spring and summer. Saturation indices show an undersaturation in relation to most phases, and the species distribution in the lakes mirrors their individual buffer environment.

It plays a significant function in the aquatic environments of rapidly developing coastal cities such as Ha Long City, Vietnam. Urban population growth, coal mining, and tourist activities have affected the water quality of Ha Long Bay. This work uses Sentinel-2/Multispectral Instrument (MSI) imagery data to a calibrated ocean chlorophyll 2-band (OC-2) model to retrieve chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration in the bay from 2019 to 2021. The variability of chlorophyll-a during seasons over the study area was inter-compared. The chlorophyll-a concentration was mapped by analyzing the time series of water cover on the Google Earth Engine platform. The results show that the OC-2 model was calibrated well to the conditions of the study areas. The calibrated model accuracy increased nearly double compared with the uncalibrated OC-2 model. The seasonal assessment of chl-a concentration showed that the phytoplankton (algae) developed well in cold weather during fall and winter. Spatially, algae grew densely inside and in the surroundings of aquaculture, urban, and tourist zones. In contrast, coal mining activities did not result in algae development. We recommend using the Sentinel-2 data for seawater quality monitoring and assessment. Future work might focus on model calibration with a longer time simulation and more in situ measured data. Moreover, manual atmospheric correction of optical remote sensing is crucial for coastal environmental studies.

J	Hardy, R; Paragamian, VL				Hardy, Ryan; Paragamian, Vaughn L.			A Synthesis of Kootenai River Burbot Stock History and Future Management Goals	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												In Idaho, Burbot Lota lota are endemic only to the Kootenai River, where they once provided an important winter fishery to the indigenous people and European settlers. This fishery and that of Kootenay Lake in British Columbia may have been the most robust Burbot fisheries in North America. However, the fishery in Idaho rapidly declined after the construction of Libby Dam by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1972, and it closed in 1992. Concomitant to the collapse in Idaho was the collapse of the Burbot fishery in Kootenay Lake and the Kootenay River. The operation of Libby Dam for hydroelectric power generation and flood control created major changes in the river's nutrient concentration, temperature, and seasonal discharge, particularly during the winter when Burbot spawn. Libby Dam operations were implicated as the major limiting factor to Burbot recruitment, giving rise to higher winter temperatures and widely fluctuating flows. Because the Burbot in the Kootenai River are at risk of demographic extinction, a conservation strategy was prepared to outline the measures necessary to rehabilitate the Burbot population to a self-sustaining level. The strategy indicated that operational discharge changes at Libby Dam are required during winter to provide suitable temperature and discharge conditions for Burbot migration and spawning. Studies recommend that the discharge at Bonners Ferry average 176m(3)/s for a minimum of 90 d (mid-November through mid-February). Furthermore, preferred Burbot water temperatures of about 6 degrees C are necessary for migration and cooler temperatures of 1-4 degrees C for spawning.

Numerical simulations are performed by means of a modeling chain composed of a meteorological (WRF) and a hydrodynamic (Delft3D) model. Transport processes are studied through the combined analysis of the residual (time averaged) flow field and the trajectories of Lagrangian particles. Results show that strong currents develop in winter under the forcing of synoptic northerly Him winds, especially in the elongated northern region, where winds are channeled by the steep orography. Significant water volumes are displaced laterally by Ekman transport, producing intense downwelling and upwelling along the steep shores. Instead summer patterns are controlled by the diurnal cycle of local breezes, alternately blowing along the main axis of the lake. The resulting circulation reveals counterclockwise gyres in the northern part, driven by the alternating wind direction and affected by Coriolis force. The analysis suggests that complex circulations can develop in lakes with relatively simple geometries, like the narrow trunk region of Lake Garda, where the effect of Earth's rotation unexpectedly influences the transport patterns.

The influence of fohn winds on Glacial Lake Washburn and palaeotemperatures in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, during the Last Glacial Maximum	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Large glacial lakes, including Glacial Lake Washburn, were present in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) despite a colder and drier climate. To address the mechanism capable of generating enough meltwater to sustain these large lakes, a conceptual model was developed based on the warming potential of infrequent contemporary fohn winds. The model suggests that fhn winds were capable of generating enough meltwater to sustain large glacial lakes during the LGM by increasing degree days above freezing (DDAF) and prolonging the melt season. A present-day relationship between infrequent summer fhn winds and DDAF was established. It is assumed that the Taylor Dome ice core record represents large-scale palaeoclimatic variations for the McMurdo Dry Valleys region. This analysis suggests that because of the warming influence of the more frequent fhn winds, summer DDAF in the McMurdo Dry Valleys during the LGM were equivalent to present-day values, but this enhanced summer signal is not preserved in the annually averaged ice core temperature record.					; Doran, Peter/ABS-7911-2022	McKay, Christopher/0000-0002-6243-1362; Obryk, Maciej/0000-0002-8182-8656; 													0954-1020	1365-2079				OCT	2017	29	5					457	467		10.1017/S0954102017000062	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954102017000062													WOS:000412678800008

Jun			Rapid field estimation of biochemical oxygen demand in a subtropical eutrophic urban lake with chlorophyll a fluorescence	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Development of a technique for rapid field estimation of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) is necessary for cost-effective monitoring and management of urban lakes. While several studies reported the usefulness of laboratory tryptophan-like fluorescence technique in predicting 5-day BOD (BOD5) of waste-water and leachates, little is known about the predictability of field chlorophyll fluorescence measurements for BOD of urban lake waters that are constantly exposed to the mixture of chemical compounds. This study was conducted to develop a numeric relationship between chlorophyll a fluorescence and BOD for a eutrophic urban lake that is widely representative of lake water conditions in the subtropical southern USA. From October 2012 to September 2013, in situ measurements at the studied lake were made every 2 weeks on chlorophyll a fluorescence and other water quality parameters including water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and specific conductivity. Water samples were taken for 5-day BOD and 10-day BOD (BOD10) analysis with and without incubation. The results showed a clear seasonal trend of both BOD measurements being high during the summer and low during the winter. There was a linear, positive relationship between chlorophyll a fluorescence and BOD, and the relationship appeared to be stronger with the 10-day BOD (r(2)=0.83) than with the 5-day BOD (r(2)=0.76). BOD dropped each day with declining chlorophyll a fluorescence, suggesting that die-off of phytoplankton has been the main consumption of oxygen in the studied lake. Ambient conditions such as rainfall and water temperature may have partially affected BOD variation.					Xu, Y. Jun/A-7681-2014; Xu, Y./A-7681-2014	Xu, Y.

More than half of the species population consists of nauplii. We studied feeding and size selectively of nauplii in suspensions which contained polystyrol latex beads in a concentration close to the natural seston. Guts of NI nauplii were free of both beads and remmants of natural food. Of NII-NVI nauplii, 67-87% took in beads. Older animals consumed more and larger particles. The maximum diameter of ingested beads reached 29-mu-m. On an average, NII nauplii took in 128-mu-m3 of beads in 10 min, whereas older animals consumed 615-900-mu-m3. The clearance rate remained below 0.01-mu-l h-1. NII nauplii strongly preferred 1.2-mu-m particles. Older nauplii did not show any preference or selected only slightly for the smallest particles. Nauplii rejected 4-11-mu-m beads. In some cases a weak positive selection could be observed toward 12-mu-m or larger beads.																			0142-7873					MAR	1991	13	2					437	453		10.1093/plankt/13.2.437	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/13.2.437													WOS:A1991EZ43500012

A winter TM image is used to provide topographic information while a summer TM image provides information on the pattern of melt and the location of lakes. Many previous hypotheses are confirmed, and some are rejected. It is shown that: 1) The snow line is easily detectable in SAR imagery; 2) areas of higher radar backscatter in the bare-ice zone most Often correspond to areas full of crevasses too small to resolve in the SAR image; 3) subsurface scattering causes significant blurring of features in SAR imagery; 4) the band of surface lakes occurring above the snow line corresponds to at least a portion of the wet-snow zone, 5) water is the cause of reduced radar backscatter above the snow line; and 6) the fact that water causes reduced radar backscatter above the snow line permits the use of backscatter variations as a proxy indicator Of surface topography in snow-covered regions experiencing melt.																			0034-4257	1879-0704				DEC	1992	42	3					167	175		10.1016/0034-4257(92)90100-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0034-4257(92)90100-X													WOS:A1992KF59200001

Daily sea surface temperature from the adjacent Atlantic Ocean and Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission daily precipitation data was used. Ten years reanalysis data of ERA-Interim, Climate Forecast System Reanalysis version 2 (CFSRv2), and National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP2) were also used for comparison with the observations. Adopted criteria were based on both surface and upper air information to identify LSB days. The results show that LSB is a seasonal phenomenon but most frequent in winter. All reanalyses underestimated the monthly occurrence and seasonal cycle of LSB, although CFSRv2 is better in reproducing the observations than ERA-Interim and NCEP2. The wind roses revealed the existence of night/early morning offshore winds. Except in summer when the southwesterly monsoon winds prevail all day, onshore winds are observed from about 1100 local solar time (LST), with a mean cessation time at 0100 LST, giving a mean duration of about 14 h. However, in Abidjan, they occurred at all hours. The vertical plots confirmed the wind direction reversals for LSB days and give an indication of its depth and speed in different months. It has been found that LSB height is influenced by the West African monsoon as intertropical discontinuity advances northwards from January. This was also seen in LSB increased speed from December to August.					; COULIBALY, Amadou/KHT-1957-2024; Sylla, Mouhamadou Bamba/HJI-6023-2023	Sylla, Mouhamadou Bamba/0000-0002-5566-0538; BALLO, Abdoulaye/0000-0001-8523-5914; COULIBALY, Amadou/0000-0002-5846-4161													0177-798X	1434-4483				OCT	2019	138	1-2					953	971		10.1007/s00704-019-02882-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-019-02882-0													WOS:000491945900066
J	Sousounis, PJ				Sousounis, PJ			Lake-aggregate mesoscale disturbances. Part IV: Development of a mesoscale aggregate vortex	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Many studies have noted that cyclone development in the Great Lakes region during winter is the result of strong diabatic heating and low-level destabilization from the lakes. The exact mechanisms, however, by which this heating and moistening lead to sea level pressure fairs, and to weak cyclones over the lakes (e.g., mesoscale aggregate vortices), have not been investigated previously. In this study, model output that includes all of the Great Lakes and none of the Great Lakes is analyzed to understand more completely the importance of synoptic-scare forcing, diabatic heating, and perturbation-synoptic-scale processes for the development of a mesoscale aggregate vortex over the region during a 48-h period between 0000 UTC 13 and 0000 UTC 15 November 1982. The analysis indicates that the sea level pressure falls and vortex development were not simply the hydrostatic result of heat from the Great Lakes "spreading" over a large region. Rather, the synoptic-scale flow contributed to vortex development during the first 24 h by providing strong cold northwesterly flow, which generated significant surface heat fluxes; and during the second 24 h by providing low-level warm advection and midlevel positive vorticity advection from southwesterly flow, which enhanced large-scale ascent and horizontal perturbation heat flux convergence near the surface. The eventual collocation of strong cyclonic perturbation southerly winds at 900 hPa, strong anticyclonic perturbation southerly winds at 700 hPa, and east-west-oriented isotherms in between greatly enhanced the warm advection and vortex development in the region. Finally, the intensifying cyclonic perturbation flow contributed significantly to surface sensible and latent heat fluxes and to further vortex development when it phased with the synoptic-scale flow at the surface. The one case that has been examined does not likely serve as an explanation for all mesoscale aggregate vortices. More studies are needed to determine the climatology of these vortices that develop over the Great Lakes region in winter.																			0027-0644					DEC	1998	126	12					3169	3188		10.1175/1520-0493(1998)126<3169:LAMDPI>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(1998)126<3169:LAMDPI>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000077657300009

Application of Geochemical Mapping in Unraveling Paleoweathering and Provenance of Karewa Deposits of South Kashmir, NW Himalaya, India	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA												Ninety Six composite stream sediment samples of Karewa deposits from parts of Pulwama and Budgam districts of south Kashmir were analysed for major, trace and rare earth elements to understand the nature of weathering and provenance. A-CN-K and A-CNK-FM plots of the samples indicate almost similar contents in Al2O3, CaO, Na2O, K2O and MgO as those of upper crust, reflecting very poor to moderate weathering history. Similarly, the low to moderate chemical index of alteration (CIA) values (33.97 to 68.87), chemical index of weathering (CIW) values (57.68 to 84.80) and plagioclase index of weathering (PIA) values (31.49 to 75.67) suggest a low to moderate intensity of weathering in source area. The discriminant function diagrams revealed quartzose sedimentary provenance, with some of the samples falling in intermediate igneous source, probably reflecting recycled orogen provenance. The sample data show fractionated REE patterns with (La/Yb)cn varying from 7.42 to 9.52 and a negative Eu anomaly 0.64-0.71, is regarded as evidence for a differentiated source. In La-Th-Sc diagram, sediments fall in a region of mixed source rocks with two samples falling in basic source rock area. The samples fall close to the values of UCC, PAAS and NASC, indicating large provenance with variable geographical and geological setting. On La/Th plot, the sediment data fall into the range of UCC, indicating that the sediments did not have a uniform provenance.

Streamflow generally plays a role in the horizontal redistribution of heat, and thermal exchange in lakes predominantly occurs in a vertical direction. However, numerical models simulate the water temperature for uncoupled rivers and lakes, and the linkages between them on a global scale remain unclear. In this study, we proposed an integrated modeling framework: Tightly Coupled framework for Hydrology of Open water Interactions in River-lake network (TCHOIR, read as "tee quire"). The objective is to simulate terrestrial fluvial and thermodynamics as a continuum of mass and energy in solid and liquid phases redistributed among rivers and lakes. TCHOIR uses high-resolution geographical information harmonized over fluvial and lacustrine networks. The results have been validated through comparison with in situ observations and satellite-based data products, and the model sensitivity has been tested with multiple meteorological forcing datasets. It was observed that the "coupled" mode outperformed the "river-only" mode in terms of discharge and temperature downstream of lakes; moreover, it was observed that seasonal and interannual variation in lake water levels and temperature are also more reliable in the "coupled" mode. The inclusion of lakes in the coupled model resulted in an increase in river temperatures during winter at midlatitudes and a decrease in temperatures during summer at high latitudes, which reflects the role of lakes as a form of large heat storage. The river-lake coupling framework presented herein provides a basis for further elucidating the role of terrestrial surface water in Earth's energy cycle.					; KIM, HYUNGJUN/I-5099-2014; Oki, Taikan/E-5778-2010; Yamazaki, Dai/J-3029-2012	Oki, Taikan/0000-0003-4067-4678; KIM, HYUNGJUN/0000-0003-1083-8416; 													1991-959X	1991-9603				SEP 14	2021	14	9					5669	5693		10.5194/gmd-14-5669-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5669-2021													WOS:000695655100001

However, the retracking algorithms are limited to a handful shapes of return echoes over assumed known surfaces, while numerous unknown waveforms exist due to the complexity of real-world land cover and other surfaces. Measurements over a surface with seasonal or ephemeral patterns could thus degrade in accuracy due to varying characteristics from the corresponding radar backscatters. In this study, we demonstrate that the Qinghai Lake, an alpine water body with distinct seasonal variation between water and ice causes inaccurate surface-height estimates when using Envisat radar altimetry and conventional retracking techniques. Following the characterization of the lake surface using EO-1 and Landsat multispectral analysis, we hypothesize that the overestimation of the lake level during winter and early spring is not from the snow accumulation; rather it is due to an error of the onboard retracker (ICE-1) which is unable to properly model the quasi-specular waveforms. Hence, we first build a classification algorithm to identify the anomalous waveforms, and then use an empirical retracking gate correction to mitigate the ice contamination. The accuracy of the 20% threshold retracker (TR) after applying suggested gate correction has a significant improvement with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 6 +/- 7 cm and a correlation of 0.98 compared with the in situ gauge data. The improvement in accuracy is 54% better than the ICE-1 and 85% than the OCEAN retrackers, respectively.					; Tseng, Kuo-Hsin/NDT-1118-2025; Lee, Hyongki/AAD-5210-2021	Shum, C K/0000-0001-9378-4067; Tseng, Kuo-Hsin/0000-0003-3581-076X; Lee, Hyongki/0000-0001-6478-7533													1017-0839	2311-7680				AUG	2013	24	4	1		SI		615	627		10.3319/TAO.2012.12.03.01(TibXS)	http://dx.doi.org/10.3319/TAO.2012.12.03.01(TibXS)													WOS:000329894700014
J	Webb, BW; Walling, DE				Webb, BW; Walling, DE			Complex summer water temperature behaviour below a UK regulating reservoir	REGULATED RIVERS-RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT												Detailed monitoring over a 15-year period has revealed considerable complexity in summer water temperature behaviour below Wimbleball Lake, a large regulating reservoir in south-west England. Continuous records of water temperature in the regulated River Haddeo and the neighbouring unregulated River Pulham, coupled with information on flow in the tailbay of the dam and on the thermal structure of the impounded water body, reveal that the nature and extent of the thermal modification below the reservoir varies from day to day, month to month and year to year. This complexity largely reflects changes in the balance between a springflow and a direct reservoir release component of the compensation runoff, which arise in response to variations within and between summers in hydrometeorological conditions and in the way the reservoir is operated to regulate downstream flows. Temperature behaviour in the regulated river is made more complicated by progressive warming of the springflow during the summer months, the thermal inertia of the stored water, the development of thermal stratification within the reservoir and the alteration of release depth. although the detailed effect of some of these factors depends on weather conditions, the use of destratification equipment and the rapidity of reservoir drawdown.

Turbidity records are scarce or unavailable over large and remote areas needed to fully understand the factors associated with turbidity, and their spatial-temporal representation remains a limitation. This work aimed to develop and validate empirical models to estimate values of turbidity from Landsat images and determine the spatial distribution of estimated turbidity in the selected Araucanian Lakes. Secchi disk depth measurements were linked with turbidity measurements to obtain a turbidity dataset. This in turn was used to develop and validate a set of empirical models to predict turbidity based on four single bands and 16 combination bands from 15 multispectral Landsat images. The best empirical models predicted turbidity over the range of 0.3-12.3 NTUs with RMSE values around 0.31-1.03 NTU, R-2 (Index of Agreement IA) around 0.93-0.99 (0.85-0.97) and mean bias error (MBE) around (-0.36-0.44 NTU). Estimation maps to analyze the temporal-spatial turbidity variation in the lakes were constructed. Finally, it was found that the meteorological conditions may affect the variation of turbidity, mainly precipitation and wind speed. The data indicate that the turbidity has slightly increased in winter-spring. These models will be used in the future to reconstruct large datasets that allow analyzing transparency trends in those lakes.					; Duran Llacer, Iongel/AAE-4362-2021; González Rodríguez, Lisdelys/JYQ-0867-2024	Gonzalez Rodriguez, Lisdelys/0000-0002-7892-4604; Duran Llacer, Iongel/0000-0003-3290-4947; Rodriguez Lopez, Lien/0000-0002-0550-0253; 														2072-4292				AUG	2021	13	16							3133	10.3390/rs13163133	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13163133													WOS:000690169600001
J	Redmond, KT				Redmond, Kelly T.			Evaporation and the hydrologic budget of Crater Lake, Oregon	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The hydrologic budget of Crater Lake, Oregon is investigated by taking advantage of its relatively simple geometry, climatic circumstances, and the concurrent availability of many years of traditional data. Buoy data are here utilized for the first time for this purpose. The lake gains water through precipitation and delayed runoff from the caldera sides and Wizard Island. The lake loses water through evaporation and seepage. Seepage can be estimated quite well from ice-covered precipitation-free intervals in 1985, and is 127 cm/year. Evaporation has previously been determined as a residual, but is here estimated directly from the floating buoy, with an approximate value of 76 cm/year, a downward revision from previous estimates. These losses are balanced by precipitation input, nearly all in the form of snow or snowmelt runoff. Factors contributing to the uncertainty in each of the water budget components are discussed in some detail. The buoy data corroborate previous findings based on studies of stage that evaporation is greatest on the coldest days. Seasonally, the greatest evaporation occurs in the autumn and the least in spring. Proxy records are used to extend the effective length of the buoy record. Monthly estimates of evaporation are calculated for 1950-1996 and used to deduce temporal characteristics. The standard deviation of water year precipitation is 4.6 times larger than that of evaporation. Thus the water budget is controlled more by variability of precipitation than evaporation. An additional 15 years of data since earlier studies confirm that the annual lake level variations from one September 30 to the next are highly correlated (r = 0.96) with Park Headquarters water year precipitation for the 42 years from 1961-2003. The lake rises 1.4 cm for every cm of measured precipitation over equilibrium value (168.6 cm) at Park Headquarters. Sources of this "magnification" are discussed.																			0018-8158					JAN	2007	574						29	46		10.1007/s10750-006-2603-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-2603-9													WOS:000242361600003
J	D'Amours, J; Dion, R				D'Amours, Julie; Dion, Rene			Juvenile lake sturgeon monitoring and determinants of year-class strength in the Rupert River, mid-northern Quebec, Canada	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												In 2007, Hydro-Quebec began the construction of the Rupert Diversion in conjunction with the Eastmain-1A and Sarcelle powerhouses. The partial diversion of the Rupert River became operational in 2009. Mitigation measures to preserve lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) habitat downstream of the diversion include an instream flow, weir and spurs to maintain water levels, and fish passage channels and spawning grounds. An environmental follow-up was done in the reduced-flow section of the Rupert. The baseline status was established from 2007 to 2009 and follow-up studies were conducted from 2010 through 2012, and in 2014 and 2016. Besides presenting results from Hydro-Quebec's environmental monitoring, analyses were performed to search for determinants of year-class strength. The results of the lake sturgeon monitoring activities indicate that the abundance of juveniles <= 8-year-old in the reduced flow section of the river remained similar or increased. Although larval production increased in post diversion conditions, cohort strength tended to decrease as did juvenile growth. Year-class strength was positively correlated with spring and summer flow. Also, a significant, strong negative correlation was found between estimated larval abundance and water temperature during larval drift.																			0175-8659	1439-0426				FEB	2019	35	1					344	354		10.1111/jai.13748	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.13748													WOS:000459917600043

The results indicated that 43 of 79 (54%) RWS and 89 of 239 (36%) DWTPs were affected by off-flavor problems in a recent 2-year period (October 2010-September 2012). Off-flavor incidents occurred in all regions in Japan. Most DWTPs affected by off-flavor incidents take in water from closed water areas, such as dams and lakes, where phototrophic microorganisms, such as cyanobacteria and algae, can grow easily. The most common off-flavor was an earthy-musty odor, while a fishy smell was also reported in some cases. The common producers of geosmin were Anabaena spp., while those responsible for 2-methylisoborneol were Phormidium spp. and Oscillatoria spp. The off-flavor events frequently occurred during summer and early fall months (June-September). The water temperature and pH of raw water for the production of drinking water when off-flavor problems occurred were higher than those during normal periods. To eliminate off-flavor compounds, most DWTPs (about 58%) adopt powdered activated carbon treatment, which considerably increases operational costs.																			0003-7214	1365-2087					2015	64	7					832	838		10.2166/aqua.2014.171	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/aqua.2014.171													WOS:000374315100008

Based on the findings, the influent to the CW still was polluted with high concentration of nutrients with TN and TP exceeding five and two times the water quality standard in rivers and lakes. The accumulation of sediment at the first treatment unit (sedimentation zone) of the CW augmented after the summer season signifying that the dredging of sediment must be conducted after the rainy season or until before the winter season. It was found out that the main phosphorus (P) types existing at the sediment in the CW were residual-P (R-P) and non-apatite-P (NAI-P) constituting to almost 90% of total P. While NAI-P can be released in the natural environment by increasing pH or reducing redox potential, and can be used by aquatic plants; R-P on the other hand exists with organic compounds and is difficult to separate. However, R-P is proportional to the absorption capacity of microorganisms which signifies that microorganisms are highly available in the CW.

Salinity tolerance as a potential driver of ecological speciation in amphipods (Gammarus spp.) from the northern Chihuahuan Desert	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Ecological speciation is the process by which barriers to gene flow arise between populations as a result of ecologically based divergent selection. Environmental salinity has been identified as one of the most important ecological drivers influencing distribution, abundance, and species richness of aquatic organisms. Springs of the northern Chihuahuan Desert vary in salinity and are home to the Gammarus pecos (Crustacea:Amphipoda) species complex. We used field experiments to compare salinity tolerance among 9 amphipod populations from geographically discrete habitats differing in ambient salinities and to calculate salinity response distances among populations. Cluster analysis placed populations into 3 groups corresponding to low, medium, and high ambient salinities. Partial Mantel tests revealed significant positive correlations between salinity tolerance and habitat salinity after controlling for other variables, such as geographic distance and neutral genetic differences. Our results provide evidence that ecological speciation could be occurring among amphipod populations at different springs, as indicated by dissimilar physiological responses that are correlated with differences in ambient spring salinities. Gene flow is restricted among populations, the restriction is reinforced by dispersal barriers between springs, and selection might preserve variants that most effectively tolerate local salinity levels. Gammarus diversification in the northern Chihuahuan Desert is driven by vicariance and isolation, along with local selection and adaptation.

Much information has been published on the growth of hydrilla but few studies have investigated the growth of naiad. We compared the growth of naiad and hydrilla plants fertilized with 0, 1, 2, or 4 g of controlled release fertilizer (CRF) (Osmocote 15N-4.05P-9.96K) per kg of sand, with the fertilizer layered into the sand prior to planting. We prepared three mesocosms per fertilizer rate, with 3 containers of naiad or hydrilla in each mesocosm. Mesocosms were randomly arranged in a greenhouse and filled with water to create a submersed growing environment. Growth was monitored for 8 weeks in Spring 2014 and was repeated in Summer 2014. Naiad shoot and root dry weights were greatest in containers fertilized with 2 g of CRF per kg of sand, while hydrilla shoot and root dry weight were greatest in containers fertilized with 4 g of CRF per kg of sand. Although these species may look similar, it is clear from this study that their nutritional requirements are different.

Its area is about 280 km(2)- with an average water depth of 1.5m during wet seasons. The water level in the lake is controlled by several factors, including runoff from Maharlou catchments, groundwater seepage, and direct rainfall over the lake and the evaporation rate. Hydrochemistry of the catchments water resources showed mainly chloride and sulfate waters due to the geology of the surrounding areas and its variable lithology. Hydrochemical investigations were carried out over a time period from 1975 to 2002 using previously published analysis, together with newly collected water samples. Two hundred thirty samples were collected during summer 2002 and spring 2005. Results showed distinct changes in the brine type over time; from Mg-SO4-Cl type reported in 1970 to a recent Na-Mg-Cl -(SO4) type, which is comparable with Great Salt Lake in the USA. A Change in diluted water composition going from HCO3 <= Ca + Mg to HCO3 Ca + Mg has taken place. That is, the path of brine composition on the Eugster and Hardie flow diagram has changed from row III2b to the path II, and may finally result in a Ca-Na-Cl or Na-SO4 Cl brine type in the future. In this study, two mixed zones of fresh and saline waters were recognized in the northwest and center of the lake, with the lowest ionic concentrations, located where there is significant river and ground water supply.					; Nakhaei, Mohammad/A-5816-2019; lak, Razyeh/IXD-4468-2023	Lak, Razyeh/0000-0003-3223-5528; Nakhaei, Mohammad/0000-0002-4823-5197; 													0891-2556	1878-5212				JUN	2007	22	1					33	42		10.1007/BF03175844	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03175844													WOS:000247161500005

Intra-habitat heterogeneity of microbial food web structure under the regime of eutrophication and sediment resuspension in the large subtropical shallow Lake Taihu, China	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Symposium on the Eutrophication Process and Control in Large Shallow Lakes	APR 22-26, 2005	Nanjing, PEOPLES R CHINA					Planktonic microbial community structure and classical food web were investigated in the large shallow eutrophic Lake Taihu (2338 km(2), mean depth 1.9 m) located in subtropical Southeast China. The water column of the lake was sampled biweekly at two sites located 22 km apart over a period of twelve month. Site 1 is under the regime of heavy eutrophication while Site 2 is governed by wind-driven sediment resuspension. Within-lake comparison indicates that phosphorus enrichment resulted in increased abundance of microbial components. However, the coupling between total phosphorus and abundance of microbial components was different between the two sites. Much stronger coupling was observed at Site 1 than at Site 2. The weak coupling at Site 2 was mainly caused by strong sediment resuspension, which limited growth of phytoplankton and, consequently, growth of bacterioplankton and other microbial components. High percentages of attached bacteria, which were strongly correlated with the biomass of phytoplankton, especially Microcystis spp., were found at Site 1 during summer and early autumn, but no such correlation was observed at Site 2. This potentially leads to differences in carbon flow through microbial food web at different locations. Overall, significant heterogeneity of microbial food web structure between the two sites was observed. Site-specific differences in nutrient enrichment (i.e. nitrogen and phosphorus) and sediment resuspension were identified as driving forces of the observed intra-habitat differences in food web structure.					陈, 雨薇/HKF-1175-2023; Hahn, Martin W./B-9998-2008; Wu, Qinglong/B-7625-2011; Hahn, Martin/B-9998-2008; Chen, Yuwei/U-9491-2017	Hahn, Martin W./0000-0003-0501-2556; Chen, Yuwei/0000-0003-0148-3609													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2007	581						241	254		10.1007/s10750-006-0500-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0500-x													WOS:000244992800026

To our best knowledge, there are no reports on the impact of a severe exposure to dilbit on the Blue mussel (Mytilus edulis). In this study, adult Blue mussels were exposed to one conventional crude oil (Heidrun) and two dilbits (Cold Lake Blend and Access Western Blend) for a period of 7 days in an ice-covered environment and then maintained for three months until the spawning season. The exposed mussels were monitored for aromatic hydrocarbon bioaccumulation, physiological energetic budget, cellular stress, byssus production and gametogenesis. In spring, spawning was induced to characterize breeding success. Bioaccumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was detected after three days of exposure, with higher concentrations of PAHs associated to the conventional oil (5.49 +/- 0.12 mu g.g(-1) d.w.) compared to both dilbits (0.91 +/- 0.02 mu g.g(-1); 0.51 +/- 0.03 mu g.g(-1) d.w.). Despite a fast depuration rate and a good resilience of the exposed mussels, significant negative effects were observed at the cellular, physiological and fitness levels, especially in offspring. Our results suggest a higher toxicity of the diluted bitumen compared to the conventional crude despite the lower bioaccumulation of total PAHs. Dilbit treatments caused evident negative transgenerational effects on unexposed F1 generation. Crown Copyright (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The O-18(PPT) and O-18(SUR) values range from-2.75 to-14.12 parts per thousand (annual mean value=-7.13 parts per thousand ) and from-2.30 to-8.56 parts per thousand, respectively. The seasonal variation of O-18(PPT) is controlled by the air mass circulation in this region, which is dominated by the Asian summer monsoon and the Siberian High during winter. The correlation between the wet seasonal averages of O-18(SUR) in runoff of the rivers and O-18(PPT) of precipitation at the corresponding stations shows that in the Poyang Lake catchment area the river water consists of 23% direct runoff (precipitation) and 77% base flow (shallow groundwater). This high proportion of groundwater in the river runoff points to the prevalence of wetland conditions in the Poyang Lake catchment during rainy season. Considering the oxygen isotopic composition of the main body of Poyang Lake, no isotopic enrichment relative to river inflow was found during the rainy season with maximum expansion of the lake. Thus, evaporation causing isotopic enrichment is a minor component of the lake water balance in the rainy period. During dry season, a slight isotopic enrichment has been observed, which suggests a certain evaporative loss of lake water in that period.																			1025-6016	1477-2639				JUN 1	2013	49	2					188	196		10.1080/10256016.2013.740480	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10256016.2013.740480								23473021					WOS:000320017800004
J	LOVELL, CR; KONOPKA, A				LOVELL, CR; KONOPKA, A			PRIMARY AND BACTERIAL PRODUCTION IN 2 DIMICTIC INDIANA LAKES	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The relationship between primary and bacterial production in 2 dimictic Indiana lakes with different primary productivities was examined during the summer stratification period in 1982. Primary production rates were calculated from rates of H14CO3- incorporation by natural samples and bacterial production was calculated from rates of [3H-methyl]thymidine incorporation by natural samples. Vertical and seasonal distributions of bacterial production in the more productive lake (Little Crooked Lake) were strongly influenced by primary production. A lag of .apprx. 2 wk between a burst in primary production and the subsequent response in bacterial production was observed. The vertical distribution of bacterial production in the water column of the less productive lake (Crooked Lake) was determined by the vertical distribution of primary production, but no clear relationship between seasonal maxima of primary and bacterial production in this lake was observed. High rates of bacterial production in Crooked Lake during May indicate the importance of allochthonous C washed in by spring rains. Bacterial production accounted for 30.6 and 31.8% of total (primary plus bacterial) production in Crooked Lake and Little Crooked Lake, respectively, from April through Oct. High rates of bacterial production during late Sept. and Oct. were observed in both lakes. Calculation of the fraction of bacterial production supported by phytoplankton excretion implies an important role for other mechanisms of supplying, such as phytoplankton autolysis. Several factors affecting the calculation of bacterial production from the thymidine incorporation rates in these lakes were examined.																			0099-2240	1098-5336					1985	49	3					485	491		10.1128/AEM.49.3.485-491.1985	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.49.3.485-491.1985								16346742					WOS:A1985ACS8200003

High total organic carbon/total nitrogen (TOC/TN) values in association with increased TOC content suggest that more soil-derived material containing terrestrial organic matter (OM) was delivered to the lake during periods of increased runoff associated with extensive precipitation that resulted from intensified summer monsoons, whereas low values indicate OM possessing a dominant algal origin during weakened summer monsoons. Rainfall intensity in terms of the proportion of terrestrial OM was high in four periods: the last deglaciation (similar to 17.2 to similar to 12.2 ka), the early Holocene (similar to 10.6 to similar to 8.6 ka), the middle Holocene Thermal Optimum (similar to 7.7 to similar to 5 ka) and the late Holocene (similar to 4.2 to similar to 2 ka), whereas it was low in the intervening time periods. High TOC/TN values coincide with peak values of summer insolation, and thus the strongest EA summer monsoon during the early and middle Holocene: small drops in these ratios correspond to increasing and decreasing solar radiation in the deglacial period and the late Holocene, respectively. The four intervals with low TOC/TN ratios, as well as episodic drops of the ratios during the deglaciation and the early and late Holocene are concordant with the late last glacial (similar to 21 to similar to 17.2 ka), the Oldest (similar to 14.8 ka), the Older (similar to 13.3 ka) and the Younger Dryas (similar to 13 to similar to 11.5 ka), the 8.2 cold event (similar to 8.6-7.7 ka) and a late Holocene cold event (similar to 5-4.2 ka), and suggest a weakened EA summer monsoon during these times. Moreover, high frequency hydrological variability occurred during the early Holocene, heavy rainfall persisted during the middle Holocene, and precipitation intensity generally diminished after similar to 5 ka. The Tung-Yuan Pond sediment record indicates that the TOC/TN ratio can be used as a paleorainfall intensity proxy to trace variations in the EA summer monsoon strength in other small lakes.

During the sampling field trips, information was collected about water temperature profiles, CO2 surface atmospheric concentrations, dissolved CO2 concentration profiles through the depth of the reservoirs, and CO2 fluxes at the surface and the bottom of the reservoirs, as well as many surface meteorological parameters. One of the goals of the project was to develop a mathematical model capable of simulating the physical processes responsible for the vertical transport of dissolved CO2 in hydroelectric reservoirs. This combined approach of measurements and numerical modeling confirmed certain hypotheses concerning the missing source of CO2, the existence of a spring peak of CO2 emission and an intense fall peak of CO2 emission for deep reservoirs. Moreover, a relation between differences in patterns of CO2 emission and reservoir depth was highlighted. It is shown that the numerical model developed in this research can be used to develop sampling strategies based on the characteristics of temporal and spatial distributions associated with each reservoir.																			0886-6236	1944-9224				DEC 14	2002	16	4							1128	10.1029/2002GB001976	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2002GB001976													WOS:000181109900004

The samples were collected from three partially separated stations of the Chashma Lake on a monthly basis. A total 42 species of zooplankton were identified from the Chashma Lake belonging to three taxa viz.; copepoda, rotifera and cladocera. The diversity of the zooplankton species in the lake was determined by richness and evenness indices, which were found as follows; Margalef Index 1.30 to 3.87, Shannon's Index 2.54 to 3.68, Simpson Index 0.92 to 0.97, Simpson's Reciprocal Index 12.25 to 37.69 and Pielou's Evenness Index 0.94 to 1.0. The zooplankton community was found abundant in summer as compared to winter. The copepods were found dominant followed by rotifers and cladocerans for entire study period. The spatial distribution of zooplankton was not found prominent as compared to their seasonal distribution.

The time-window of investigation included the Allerod, the Younger Dryas, and the Preboreal. Characteristic major and minor oscillations in the oxygen-isotope stratigraphy, such as the Gerzensee oscillation, the onset and end of the Younger Dryas stadial, and the Preboreal oscillation, were identified by isotope analysis of bulk-sediment carbonates of the same core and were used as independent indicators for hemispheric or global scale climatic change. In general, the pollen-inferred mean summer temperature reconstruction using all three inference models follows the oxygen-sotope curve more closely than the cladoceran curve. The cladoceran-inferred reconstruction suggests generally warmer summers than the pollen-based reconstructions, which may be an effect of terrestrial vegetation not being in equilibrium with climate due to migrational lags during the Late Glacial and early Holocene. Allerod summer temperatures range between 11 and 12 degrees C based on pollen, whereas the cladoceran-inferred temperatures lie between 11 and 13 degrees C. Pollen and cladocera-inferred reconstructions both suggest a drop to 9-10 degrees C at the beginning of the Younger Dryas. Although the Allerod-Younger Dryas transition lasted 150-160 years in the oxygen-isotope stratigraphy, the pollen-inferred cooling took 180-190 years and the cladoceran-inferred cooling lasted 250-260 years. The pollen-inferred summer temperature rise to 11.5-12 degrees C at the transition from the Younger Dryas to the Preboreal preceded the oxygen-isotope signal by several decades, whereas the cladoceran-inferred warming lagged. Major discrepancies between the pollen- and cladoceran-inference models are observed for the Preboreal, where the cladoceran-inference model suggests mean summer temperatures of up to 14-15 degrees C. Both pollen- and cladoceran-inferred reconstructions suggest a cooling that may be related to the Gerzensee oscillation, but there is no evidence for a cooling synchronous with the Preboreal oscillation as recorded in the oxygen-isotope record. For the Gerzensee oscillation the inferred cooling was ca. 1 and 0.5 degrees C based on pollen and cladocera, respectively, which lies well within the inherent prediction errors of the inference models.

Performance and cost advantage of stocking locally sourced Walleye fry into southern Minnesota lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												ObjectiveA genetically distinct strain of Walleye Sander vitreus (southern Minnesota strain [SMS]) persists in southern Minnesota lakes despite decades of stocking more easily obtained strains from outside of the region. Because of the regional performance advantage inferred by this persistence, we conducted in situ experiments to compare survival and stocking cost of SMS Walleye fry against those of a frequently stocked northern Minnesota strain (Mississippi headwaters strain [MIS]) to determine whether it is beneficial to expand SMS fry stocking in lieu of historic practices.MethodsWe conducted four paired stockings of oxytetracycline-marked SMS fry and MIS fry into six southern Minnesota lakes and then sampled the fish as fall fingerlings during 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2022. We then used fluorescent microscopy and parentage-based tagging techniques to discern the stocked strains for comparison of growth and survival. We also obtained production and stocking cost data from agency records to calculate relative stocking costs.ResultBy the end of their first summer, SMS Walleye from all but two stockings exhibited higher survival than MIS Walleye. Despite higher initial costs to produce SMS fry, their higher survival to fall fingerlings made the stocking of SMS fry more cost effective than MIS fry stocking. Natural reproduction was also identified in several stocked lakes, most of which consisted of either high or increasing levels of SMS ancestry.ConclusionA local strain can outperform nonlocal strains at a level that can overcome additional costs of developing a new egg source. In addition, natural reproduction of local-strain Walleye may reduce or eliminate the need for future stocking. Impact statement We show that a local Walleye strain can outperform nonlocal strains at a level that can overcome additional costs of developing a new egg source. In addition, higher natural reproduction of the local strain may reduce or eliminate the need for future stocking.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				OCT	2024	44	5					932	946		10.1002/nafm.11025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.11025		AUG 2024											WOS:001296421500001

Predicting the spatial mud energy and mud deposition boundary depth in a small boreal reservoir before and after draw down	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												We predicted the distribution of coarse- and fine-grained substrata in a small boreal lake at natural lake level and then assessed if the extents of sediment focusing due to water level manipulation could be predicted. The littoral substratum and upper limit to the distribution of mud was mapped completely prior to experimental draw down and the upper depth limit of mud was mapped in each of the first 2 years of a new water level regime. Six published equations for estimating the position of the mud boundary and the lower limit of surface wave energy were applied using maps of fetch, slope, and depth. At natural lake level, the agreement between observed and estimated mud boundaries in deep water was remarkable (<5 m horizontal). Agreement between the depth of mixing by surface waves and mud boundaries in shallow water was closest, at times exact, for equations with estimates similar to maximum wave height. However, the size of waves responsible for the shallow sediment boundaries remains unclear due to natural variation of lake level. All models overestimated energy in shallow depositional settings where exposure and slope was low. Refocusing of sediment due to maximum winter draw down of 3 m resulted in contraction and expansion of the profundal zone; a net decrease in area of 3% was evident after 2 years. Our results demonstrate that mud deposition models can be used in deep lake basins to map the littoral and profundal zones. Sediment refocusing in the first few years of winter draw down is forced mainly by falling lake levels. The interpretation of littoral habitat complexity can be simplified by understanding the lake-wide spatial pattern of erosion, transport, and deposition of sediments.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2008	24	3					261	272		10.1080/07438140809354066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140809354066													WOS:000269666500005

Influence of hydrological connectivity on winter limnology in floodplain lakes of the Saskatchewan River Delta, Saskatchewan	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Globally, hydrological connectivity between rivers and their floodplains has been reduced by river flow management and land transformation. The Saskatchewan River Delta is North America's largest inland delta and a hub for fish and fur production. To determine the influence of connectivity on limnology within this northern floodplain, water chemistry and stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta H-2) were analyzed during the winter of 2014 in 26 shallow lakes along a hydrological gradient. A total of five lake connectivity categories were determined by optical remote sensing imagary of surface water coverage area from years of varying flood intensities. Accuracy of categories was verified by degree of O-18 and H-2 enrichment within lakes. Both isotopes showed marked successional enrichment between connectivity categories, with more isolated lakes exhibiting greater enrichment. Water chemistry in lakes with greater connectivity to the main channel were characterized by higher pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrates, and sulfates and lower total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and ammonium compared with more isolated lakes. These findings illustrate how connectivity influences water chemistry in northern floodplain lakes and how it might determine the suitability of these lakes as winter refuge for fishes. Additionally, our study provides supporting evidence for the effective use of optical remote sensing imagery, an inexpensive and accessible source of data for researchers, when determining connectivity characteristics of large northern floodplain systems. Additionally, this study provides further evidence that the inundation of floodplain lakes by river water during peak discharge has an impact on the conditions within the lakes long into the winter ice-cover season. Understanding the year-round influence of river-floodplain connection is imperative for assessing potential impacts of climate change and future water regulation on such ecosystems.					; Sagin, Jay/F-7522-2013; Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich/AFM-9194-2022; Jardine, Timothy/AFZ-4837-2022; Sagin, Jay/F-7522-2013; Baulch, Helen/I-9529-2012	Jardine, Timothy/0000-0002-5917-9792; Baulch, Helen/0000-0001-9018-4998; Sagin, Jay/0000-0002-0386-888X; Sagin, Jay/0000-0002-0386-888X; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	2016	73	1					140	152		10.1139/cjfas-2015-0210	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2015-0210													WOS:000370048500012

Phototrophic Communities of the Berikei Highly Mineralized Mesothermal Sulfide Springs (Dagestan, Russia)	MICROBIOLOGY												Phototrophic communities forming in the bottom of the Berikei highly mineralized mesothermal sulfide springs (Kayakent region, Dagestan, Russia) were investigated. The Berikei springs are an interesting example of combined effect of such factors as temperature, salinity, pH, and sulfide of occurrence and structure of phototrophic microbial communities. The water was of the sodium chloride type with salinity of 4897 g/L, near-neutral brine pH, and sulfide concentration of similar to 1 mM. The temperature at the stream bottom was as high as 60 degrees C. Elevated temperature and high salinity limited the development of phototrophic communities. Formation of cyanobacterial mats occurred at temperatures below 54 degrees C. Phormidium-like cyanobacteria and unicellular Synechocystis sp. predominated in the mats. The number of cyanobacterial species increased at desalination to 4857 g/L with emergence of the species morphologically resembling Spirulina sp., Leptolyngbya sp., and Oscillatoria sp. Among anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria, halophilic purple bacteria Ectothiorhodospira sp., Marichromatium sp., and Rhodovulum sp., green sulfur bacteria Prosthecochloris sp., and unidentified Chloroflexi were present. Oxygenic photosynthesis in the mats was not inhibited by sulfide. Production of cyanobacterial mats was up to 4.753.8 mu g/(cm(2) h). The contribution of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria to photosynthetic production varied from 0 to 100%. The composition of this microbial community was compared to those of the phototrophic microbial communities of the mesothermal springs of the Dead Sea coast (Israel), the Washington warm lake (United States), and the Paoha Island hot springs (Mono Lake, United States.

Role of temperature in growth, feeding, and vertical distribution of the mixotrophic chrysophyte Dinobryon	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Dinobryon spp. are common components of the phytoplankton in temperate lakes. While these chrysophytes link bacterial carbon as well as primary production to the larger food web, few studies have examined their vertical distribution over a season. Data were collected over a 2.5 yr period in mesotrophic Lake Lacawac in eastern Pennsylvania (USA) to examine water column attributes relating to seasonality of the mixotrophic alga D. cylindricum, and specifically to address a hypothesis that abundance and vertical distribution in the genus are associated with temperature. This information was used to guide laboratory experiments examining temperature and light effects on growth, feeding, and vertical migration of cultured Dinobryon. Data from Lake Lacawac and the literature indicated that high abundances of Dinobryon were associated with a narrow range of temperature (9-18 degrees C) relative to temperatures where they were present (3-26 degrees C). High abundances of several species of Dynobryon were associated with this temperature range, and occurred from late winter to late spring, depending on latitude and depth in the water column. Although high Dinobryon abundances were not tied directly to levels of photosynthetically active radiation in Lake Lacawac, a UV-exclusion experiment in a nearby oligotrophic lake indicated a temperature-dependent negative effect of UV radiation. UV may limit the occurrence of Dinobryon populations in surface waters of clear oligotrophic lakes. Laboratory experiments showed that both light and temperature affected growth and feeding rates of Dinobryon, and that maximum feeding and growth rates occurred within the temperature range where high Dinobryon abundances were observed in field studies.					; Sanders, Robert/C-1116-2011	Princiotta, Sarah/0000-0002-9152-4146; Sanders, Robert/0000-0001-7264-1059													0948-3055	1616-1564					2013	71	2					155	163		10.3354/ame01673	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame01673													WOS:000329951800005
J	Schwab, DJ; Beletsky, D				Schwab, DJ; Beletsky, D			Relative effects of wind stress curl, topography, and stratification on large-scale circulation in Lake Michigan - art. no. 3044	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												[1] This paper uses the results from two multiseason numerical model simulations of Lake Michigan hydrodynamics to examine the relative effects of wind stress curl, topography, and stratification on large-scale circulation. The multiseason simulations provide a period long enough to encompass the full range of atmospheric and thermal conditions that can occur in the lake. The purpose of this paper is to diagnose the relative importance of various mechanisms responsible for the large-scale circulation patterns by analyzing the vorticity balance in the lake on a monthly timescale. Five different model scenarios are used to isolate the predominant mechanisms: (1) baroclinic lake, spatially variable wind stress; (2) barotropic lake, spatially variable wind stress; (3) baroclinic lake, spatially uniform wind stress; (4) barotropic lake, spatially uniform wind stress; and (5) barotropic lake, linearized equations, spatially uniform wind stress. By comparing the results of these five model scenarios it is shown that the cyclonic wind stress curl in the winter and the effect of baroclinicity in the summer are primarily responsible for the predominantly cyclonic flow in the lake. Topographic effects are also important but are not as significant as wind stress curl and baroclinic effects. Nonlinear effects are much smaller.					; Schwab, David/B-7498-2012	Beletsky, Dmitry/0000-0003-4532-0588; 													2169-9275	2169-9291				FEB 21	2003	108	C2							3044	10.1029/2001JC001066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2001JC001066													WOS:000181984900003

Driving factors of the potentially toxic and harmful species of Prorocentrum Ehrenberg in a semi-enclosed Mediterranean lagoon (Tunisia, SW Mediterranean)	MEDITERRANEAN MARINE SCIENCE												We analysed the dynamics of the potentially toxic and harmful species of Prorocentrum Ehrenberg in Bizerte Lagoon (important aquaculture area, Northern Tunisia), substantiating the possible driving forces (temperature, salinity and nutrients), based on a two-year database. We revealed that Prorocentrum spp. blooms of high magnitude (10(4) - 10(5) cells l(-1)) occurred mostly during the period of late winter to early spring. We found five species of Prorocentrum, two of which, namely P lima and P. cordatum, the most common during the field, are confirmed agents of Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning in various regions of the world. Prorocentrum sp., P. micans and P. gracile were however present only sporadically but with high cell abundances, exemplifying bloom densities. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that P minimum and P lima were much more abundant in eutrophic waters characterized by high Chla biomass, while P. gracile species occurred principally in warm waters. Furthermore, Prorocentrum sp. and P micans seemed more likely to proliferate in saline waters with high concentrations of inorganic nutrients (nitrate, ammonia and phosphate). Our study calls attention to a possible intensification of DSP events in Bizerte Lagoon, given the propensity of Prorocentrum spp. to proliferate in a eutrophic system.

We used non-destructive in situ multichannel reflection spectrometry data from a short sediment core of Laguna Aculeo (33 degrees 50'S/70 degrees 54'W, 355 m a.s.l., central Chile). Calibration-in-time (period AD 1901-2000, cross-validated with split periods) revealed robust correlations between local DJF temperatures and total sedimentary chlorin (relative absorption band depth (RABD) centred in 660-670 nm RABD(660;670): r=0.79, P<0.01; five-years triangular filtered) and the degree of pigment diagenesis (R-660nm/670 nm: r=0.82, P<0.01; five-years triangular filter). Root Mean Squared Error values are small (between 0.24 and 0.34 degrees C) suggesting that most of the reconstructed decadal-scale climate variability is significant. Our data provide quantitative evidence for the presence of a Medieval Climate Anomaly (in this case, warm summers between AD 1150 and 1350; Delta T = +0.27 to +0.37 degrees C with respect to (wrt) twentieth century) and a very cool period synchronous to the 'Little IceAge' starting with a sharp drop between AD 1350 and AD 1400 (-0.3 degrees C/10 yr, decadal trend) followed by constantly cool (Delta T = -0.70 to -0.90 degrees C wrt twentieth century) summers until AD 1750. The structure of variability is consistent in great detail with annually resolved tree-ring based warm-season temperature and river discharge reconstructions from northern Patagonia (42 degrees S) for the past 400 years, with qualitative climate reconstructions from Andean glacier fluctuations, and with hydrological changes in Patagonian lake sediment records.						von Gunten, Lucien/0000-0003-0425-2881; Appleby, Peter/0000-0002-6945-1841													0959-6836	1477-0911				SEP	2009	19	6					873	881		10.1177/0959683609336573	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683609336573													WOS:000269026100006
J	ZUREK, R; BUCKA, H				ZUREK, R; BUCKA, H			ALGAL SIZE CLASSES AND PHYTOPLANKTON-ZOOPLANKTON INTERACTING EFFECTS	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The dependences of the numbers of individuals in the chief groups of zooplankton on the size classes of phytoplankton were analysed. Four criteria were used in sorting phytoplankton: length, width, sum of length and width, and 'surface' (product of length and width). All dimensions measured were the maximum ones, i.e. including spines, mucilaginous sheaths, etc. Seasonal variability in the dimensions of algae was taken into consideration. The highest correlation coefficients (r = 0.80) were obtained for rotifers using the surface criterion. Slightly lower values were found using length or the sum of the length and width. Cladocera and Copepoda significantly depended only on algae sorted according to length and also, to a very small degree, on algae sorted according to the sum of the length and width. Division of algae according to their surface seems to give more information than division according to only one dimension. In the spring and summer, the environment was occupied by the smallest phytoplankton species; later it was dominated by larger algae, and after that by still larger algae. Also considered is the use of apparent volume (as equivalent sphere volume to non-spherical-shaped particles circumscribed over their largest dimensions) to construct size spectra. However, apparent surface as a rectangle is less laborious to calculate, as is suggested here. Exemplifying coefficients, K, of apparent magnification of the dimensions of the algal thallus, resulting from various ways of expressing these dimensions, were calculated.																			0142-7873					JUN	1994	16	6					583	601		10.1093/plankt/16.6.583	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/16.6.583													WOS:A1994NT79000001

Phylogenetic characterization and prevalence of "Spirobacillus cienkowskii," a red-pigmented, spiral-shaped bacterial pathogen of freshwater Daphnia species	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Microscopic examination of the hemolymph from diseased daphniids in 17 lakes in southwestern Michigan and five rock pools in southern Finland revealed the presence of tightly coiled bacteria that bore striking similarities to the drawings of a morphologically unique pathogen, "Spirobacillus cienkowskii," first described by Elya Metchnikoff more than 100 years ago. The uncultivated microbe was identified as a deeply branching member of the Deltaproteobacteria through phylogenetic analyses of two conserved genes: the 16S rRNA-encoding gene (rrs) and the P-subunit of topoisomerase (gyrB). Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed that the rRNA gene sequence originated from bacteria with the tightly coiled morphology. Microscopy and PCR amplification with pathogen-specific primers confirmed infections by this bacterium in four species of Daphnia: Daphnia dentifera, D. magna, D. pulicaria, and D. retrocurva. Extensive field surveys reveal that this bacterium is widespread geographically and able to infect many different cladoceran species. In a survey of populations of D. dentifera in lakes in Michigan, we found the bacterium in 17 of 18 populations studied. In these populations, 0 to 12% of the individuals were infected, with an average of 3% during mid-summer and early autumn. Infections were less common in rock pool populations of D. magna in southern Finland, where the pathogen was found in 5 of 137 populations. The broad geographic distribution, wide host range, and high virulence of S. cienkowskii suggest it plays an important role in the ecology and evolution of daphniids.

Application of two stream water temperature simulation models in the Fenton River-Storrs-Connecticut	TECNOLOGIA Y CIENCIAS DEL AGUA												In this research, the physically-based WTS (Water Temperature Simulation) model was developed to predict water temperature changes in a river in eastern Connecticut during the summer. The model was applied and calibrated with a one-hour time step during the summer's low-flow season on the Fenton River, which is tributary of the Mansfield Hollow Lake. Temperatures were recorded at one-hour intervals during the summer in 2004 and 2005, at various locations along the river to provide data for the model's calibration. Model results were tested against observed stream temperatures and also compared to the SSTemp (Stream Segment Temperature model) created by Bartholow (2002). Results show that both models can be used to predict changes in stream temperature due to changes in groundwater inflow/outflow, and could be used to assess various water management scenarios.

Todd; George, Tara; Sharma, Sapna			Cyanobacteria in cold waters: A study of nearshore cyanobacteria assemblages in Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Cyanobacterial blooms, often associated with warm, eutrophic lakes, are of widespread concern owing to their potential disruption of ecological and public health. Recently, cyanobacterial blooms have been observed in oligotrophic lakes, including Lake Superior, a large cold-water system. Despite recent developments, limited research has targeted phytoplankton assemblages in the northern Lake Superior nearshore, where isolated cyanobacteria blooms have emerged since 2019. In 2019, the cyanobacteria assemblage at 10 nearshore monitoring stations was examined to understand potential bloom-forming taxa and their association with water quality. We observed a diverse cyanobacteria assemblage, with highest densities in spring and biomass in fall. Pseudanabaena limnetica, Dolichospermum flosaquae and Limnothrix sp. were the most prevalent species across sites and seasons. Variation partitioning analysis revealed that water quality conditions were more influential drivers of cyanobacteria density and biomass than meteorological factors, particularly in regions with elevated nutrient inputs and following stormy conditions. However, at present, cyanobacteria compose <15 % of the total phytoplankton biomass in the study areas. Our monitoring data and recent reports of cyanobacteria blooms on the north shore, suggests that current blooms are not widespread. Nonetheless, we found a diverse array of cyanobacteria taxa, with most capable of producing cyanotoxins. Considering the global uncertainty in the factors contributing to cyanobacteria blooms, in association with the large-scale climatic changes affecting Lake Superior, a proactive approach to assessing risks of blooms is suggested. This should include data-generating efforts (e.g., frequent phytoplankton monitoring and reported blooms investigations) to support future collaborative initiatives focused on managing cyanobacterial blooms.																			0380-1330					FEB	2025	51	1							102425	10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102425	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102425		JAN 2025											WOS:001411493000001

Of 19 ostracod species recovered, 13 were calibrated according to their living temperature ranges, enabling us to reconstruct mean January and July temperature ranges using the mutual ostracod temperature range (MOTR) method. The occurrences of Cytheromorpha fuscata and Limnocythere suessenbornensis from 44 000 to 25 500 cal. a BP showed mean January temperatures at least 7 degrees C colder and mean July temperature at least 1 degrees C cooler in some intervals compared to present-day temperatures. Comparison of the MOTR-derived January minima curve with a Greenland oxygen isotope record (NGRIP) shows a remarkable correlation of warmer Greenland Interstadial and the colder Greenland Stadial events with clear peaks and troughs in the MOTR signal. These correlations were tested successfully by tuning the MOTR curve to the NGRIP record, resulting in an improved age-depth model combining radiocarbon ages with MOTR tie points. The results demonstrate that a record of rapid climate change in the North Atlantic region is archived in lacustrine ostracod assemblages in central Italy.					; Wagner, Bernd/J-4682-2012; Francke, Alexander/N-9761-2013; Ariztegui, Daniel/AFU-2302-2022	Ariztegui, Daniel/0000-0001-7775-5127; marchegiano, marta/0000-0001-8230-0223; Wagner, Bernd/0000-0002-1369-7893; Francke, Alexander/0000-0002-0370-5802; 													0300-9483	1502-3885				OCT	2020	49	4					739	750		10.1111/bor.12450	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bor.12450		JUN 2020											WOS:000536612300001

Astronomical forcing of meter-scale organic-rich mudstone-limestone cyclicity in the Eocene Dongying sag, China: Implications for shale reservoir exploration	AAPG BULLETIN												The middle Eocene Dongying sag in the Bohai Bay Basin of China has an estimated shale oil resource of approximately 1.1 billion t (8.06 billion bbl); flows of shale oil have been produced in the succession from tens of wells, where the daily production of a single well generally varies between 10 and 100 t (73.3-733 bbl). Therein, the mudrock successions composed of meter-scale mudstone-limestone couplets are the most important shale oil -producing layers. The controls on the deposition of the meter -scale mudstone-limestone couplets, however, remain enigmatic, constraining the analysis of lithofacies and, therefore, sweet spot distributions. Here, we analyze three continuously cored organic-rich successions of mudstone-limestone couplets (371 m [1217 ft] in total) in the middle Eocene Dongying sag, accompa-nied by decimeter-to meter-scale sampling and testing of miner-alogy, organic geochemistry, and paleontology of the rocks. Our integrated cyclostratigraphic analysis shows that the observed mudstone-limestone couplets occur at periods that coincide with Milankovitch periodicities; 21-k.y. precession cycles are the main driver of the meter-scale mudstone-limestone couplets, with additional imprints of 41-k.y. obliquity cycles. Specifically, precession minima are associated with high summer insolation and consequently high summer monsoonal precipitation, which increased river discharge and terrigenous input to the basin, resulting in the deposition of siliciclastic-rich mudstones. In the study, low summer insolation during precession maxima led to decreased summer monsoonal precipitation, lower river dis-charge and terrigenous input, and increased lake water salinity, resulting in the deposition of authigenic lime mudstones. The shale reservoir quality kept pace with the orbital climate changes; compared with lime mudstones deposited during pre-cession maxima, mudstones deposited during precession minima had higher total organic carbon, porosity, and oil content, but lower brittleness.

In the calculations the system of Navier-Stokes equations is used. The entry of the meteorite into the water at an angle of 20A degrees is modeled. The numerical experiments are performed both with and without account for the ice cover of the lake. The dimensions of the ice cover disruption are evaluated.

This is the first and preliminary summary of ongoing palaeoenvironmental research at this spring mound complex, which is situated 70 km northwest of Bloemfontein near Dealesville. Topographic mapping, radiocarbon and OSL dating complement the archaeological, faunal and palynological records from Baden-Baden and compare it to other spring, pan and alluvial sites in the region like Florisbad, Deelpan and Erfkroon. OSL and radiocarbon dating places the available sequences within the last similar to 160 ka. Holocene archaeological and faunal remains were recovered from several excavations on the east side of the primary mound. These materials provide unique insights into prehistoric human adaptations in the grassveld. Pollen, extracted from a peat mound and buried organic layers beneath sand accumulations, suggests cooler, moist conditions during the late Pleistocene and drier conditions in the Holocene. These palaeoenvironmental proxy indicators offer the potential for better understanding of long-term climate and vegetation changes in the western Free State.

J	Wang, YP; Ding, P; Chen, SH; Zheng, GM				Wang, Yanping; Ding, Ping; Chen, Shuihua; Zheng, Guangmei			Nestedness of bird assemblages on urban woodlots: Implications for conservation	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Nestedness is a pattern frequently observed in fragmented systems and has important implications for conservation. The few existing nestedness studies in urban landscapes have focused on the resident and breeding birds, while little attention has been paid to the wintering birds. Using distribution data of 60 bird species collected on 20 urban woodlots in Hangzhou, China, we tested for the existence of the nestedness and the underlying mechanisms for breeding birds and wintering species separately. We used the line-transect method to survey bird occupancy and abundance on 20 woodlots. We used two recently developed metrics, WNODF and NODF, to estimate nestedness. We used partial Spearman rank correlations to examine the associations of nestedness and habitat variables (area, isolation, habitat richness and human disturbance). We also used information-theoretic methods based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to determine ecological processes underlying nestedness. The community compositions of breeding birds and wintering species were all significantly nested. Habitat nestedness is the main driver of species nestedness for all the bird assemblages. Human disturbance played an important role in the development of species nestedness for breeding birds, but not for wintering species. Nestedness of all the bird assemblages was not due to passive sampling, selective extinction or selective colonization. From a conservation viewpoint, our results indicate that we should protect woodlots with diverse habitats priorly and refrain from using breeding birds and wintering species as surrogates for each other in developing conservation planning.

The second hypothesis assumed that species richness of zooplankton is increasing along the river due to washing out littoral and benthic species. The study was carried out in the years 2009-2010, during summer-autumn strong dominance of toxic filamentous Cyanobacteria in a shallow hypertrophic humic Siemianowka Dam Reservoir (northeast Poland) and the outflowing Narew River. During research samples were collected on three consecutive days because water requires approximately as much time to cover the distance from the dam down to 118 km of the river. Results of two-year studies confirmed both hypotheses. The hypertrophic reservoir was the huge source of rotifers and crustaceans for the outflowing river. However, a rapid decline was observed in zooplankton abundance below the dam at the distance of 9.1 km. With decreasing share of reservoir dominants along river, an increasing importance of littoral and benthic rotifers constituted ca 0.8% at the dam and 37.5% at 118 km of the river and crustacean ca 4% and 60% respectively. The dam reservoirs similar as fluvial lakes disrupt river continuity by changing the conditions of the zooplankton development. The strongest influence of reservoir on potamozooplankton communities is observed below outlets.

Dietary overlap of sympatric diving ducks during winter on northeastern Lake Ontario	AUK												Food resources available to diving ducks wintering on the Great Lakes have changed dramatically since the introduction of dreissenid mussels (Dreissena bugensis and D. polymorpha). We investigated the diets of Buffleheads (Bucephala albeola), Common Goldeneyes (B. clangula), and Long-tailed Ducks (Clangula hyemalis) during winter, 2002-2004, on northeastern Lake Ontario and determined the levels of dietary overlap. Dietary niche-breadth values were low, and dietary overlap values (prey size and type) were high for all species. Ducks primarily consumed high-quality, energy-dense prey (Amphipoda, Chironomidae), which were abundant. Our results highlighted three patterns: (1) dreissenid mussels constituted 85% of the macroinvertebrate community in Lake Ontario but were consumed in relatively low amounts during winter, (2) foods of high energy-density such as Amphipoda and Chironomidae were likely abundant enough for ducks to selectively feed on them, and (3) some constraint caused ducks to select energy-dense prey instead of the most available items (dreissenid mussels). Although the abundance of prey may have allowed numbers of diving ducks to increase in the past few decades on the Great Lakes, the long-term implications of high levels of dietary overlap among diving ducks is relatively unknown and warrants continued monitoring.

Before 17,090 cal yr BP, the vegetation type was alpine steppe desert with a cold and dry climate on the southern Tibetan Plateau. The high percentages of extra arboreal pollen (Pinus) indicate that the climate was mainly controlled by strong Westerlies. After 17,090 cal yr BP, alpine meadows mainly consisting of Cyperaceae were widely distributed in the study area. This shift in vegetation type may have been induced by increasing Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) precipitation and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The expansion of the montane mixed forests after 12,480 cal yr BP indicates that vertical migration of the vegetation belt occurred under the influence of a strong ISM and climate warming. These vegetation changes suggest that the climate has gradually become moister and warmer since the late glacial period, which is consistent with the intensified ISM and the summer solar insolation of the Northern Hemisphere.

The MODIS-derived LSWT is widely used as a reference for lake model validations and process studies in data-scarce regions. In this study, the accuracy of the MODIS LSWT was examined on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). In-situ subsurface temperatures were collected at five large lakes. Although the observation period covers from summer to winter, only the observations during the lake turnover period (from October to freeze-up), when the lakes are well mixed, can be used as ground truth. The MODIS LSWT agrees well with the selected in-situ data for the five large lakes, with root mean square error (RMSE) < 1 degrees C at nighttime and <2 degrees C in the daytime, indicating a high accuracy of the MODIS LSWT data. Before the turnover period, the water is thermally stratified and the surface water is warmer than the subsurface water, and thus the in-situ subsurface water temperature data and the MODIS LSWT have different representativeness. In this case, if the observations are used as a validation basis, the MODIS errors could be much magnified. This in turn indicates the importance of period selection for the validation.

The metalimnetic oxygen minimum (MOM) usually occurs periodically in summer and autumn in deep-water reservoirs due to algae blooms and thermal stratification. This study aimed to explore the physiological and molecular responses of Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) under MOM conditions (darkness coupled with low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, hydrostatic pressure, and nutrient starvation). The comprehensive response of M. aeruginosa suggested that MOM conditions led to an immediate collapse of gas vesicles. This was followed by a gradual inhibition of photosynthesis by disturbing the electron transport chain and a significant downregulation of energy metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism. The active cells were approximately 5 % and > 45 % under MOM aerobic (3.0-7.0 mg/L DO) and anaerobic conditions (< 0.5 mg/L DO), respectively, for 20 days. In addition, a single exposure to darkness or pressure accelerated the decay of M. aeruginosa cells; however, MOM conditions with a low DO concentration had the opposite effect. The survival of M. aeruginosa cells under MOM conditions could be attributed to stringent response and the activation of HIF-1 signal when DO concentration decreased to < 2.0 mg/L by promoting the formation of cellular quiescence and resource redistribution. This study sheds light on the molecular response and adaptation mechanism of M. aeruginosa under MOM conditions.

Long-term changes in a population of an invasive bivalve and its effects	OECOLOGIA												Although the ecological and economic effects of non-native species probably often change through time, few studies have documented such effects. The zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) is an important invader that has had large ecological and economic effects on the ecosystems it has invaded in North America and western Europe. Our 20-year study of the Hudson River, New York, showed that the characteristics of a zebra mussel population and its effects on other benthic animals both changed substantially through time. Over the period of study, annual survivorship of adult zebra mussels fell > 100-fold, which caused the aggregate filtration rate of the population to fall by 82%. Population size and body size of zebra mussels may also have fallen. In the early years of the invasion, densities of nearly all benthic animals in deepwater sites fell steeply (by 80-99%). After about 8 years of decline, these populations began to recover, and are approaching pre-invasion densities. The littoral zoobenthos showed neither the initial decline nor the subsequent recovery. Although the mechanisms behind these changes are not fully clear, our study shows that the effects of an invader may change considerably over time.

J	WOTTON, RS				WOTTON, RS			VERY HIGH SECONDARY PRODUCTION AT A LAKE OUTLET	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Larvae and pupae of Simulium noelleri Fried. coated the concrete of parts of an artificial lake outlet in southern England [UK]. In the first two (of three) summer generations, development was synchronous and this allowed the calculation of their secondary production by the instantaneous growth method. The production of the two summer generations was, respectively, 229.1 g C m-2 (7.4 g C m-2 day-1) and 185.5 g C m-2 (8.8 g C m-2 day-1). The contribution of the third summer generation, and the overwintering generation, to annual production would be less than that of the first two summer generations. Nevertheless, annual production will have exceeded 500 g C m-2 at this site. Larvae are suspension feeders and they captured the rich supply of particulate and dissolved organic material which passed over them after export from the lake. As food is brought to the larvae they only require space for attachment and can thus build up very high population densities (which exceeded 1 .times. 106 m-2 on some occasions during the summer). The high population densities result in a high biomass and hence in the high levels of production.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	1988	20	3					341	346		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1988.tb00459.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1988.tb00459.x													WOS:A1988T099100005

To investigate the epidemiology of HPAIVs brought to Japan from surrounding areas, a genetic analysis of H5 HPAIVs isolated in northern Japan was performed, and the pathogenicity of the HPAIV in chickens was assessed by experimental infection. Based on the genetic analysis of the hemagglutinin gene, pathogenic viruses detected in northern Japan as well as one in Sakhalin, the eastern part of Russia, were classified into the same subgroup as viruses prevalent in Europe in the same season but distinct from those circulating in Asia in winter 2020-2021. High identities of all eight segment sequences of A/crow/Hokkaido/0103B065/2022 (H5N1) (Crow/Hok), the representative isolates in northern Japan in 2022, to European isolates in the same season could also certify the unlikeliness of causing gene reassortment between H5 HPAIVs and viruses locally circulating in Asia. According to intranasal challenge results in six-week-old chickens, 50% of the chicken-lethal dose of Crow/Hok was calculated as 10(4.5) times of the 50% egg-infectious dose. These results demonstrated that the currently prevalent H5 HPAIVs could spread widely from certain origins throughout the Eurasian continent, including Europe and the Far East, and implied a possibility that contagious viruses are gathered in lakes in the northern territory via bird migration. Active monitoring of wild birds at the global level is essential to estimate the geographical source and spread dynamics of HPAIVs.

The swimming speed of smelt (Osmerus eperlanus) was 0.18 m .s(-1) in daylight and 0.36 m .s(-1) at night. The corresponding figures for vendace (Coregonus albula) were 0.11-0.17 and 0.05-0.08 m .s(-1). Nights immediately before and after fishing were the best periods to estimate the effect of seining on fish density. The hydroacoustic fish density estimates at night corresponded closely with seine catches. We conclude that it is possible to estimate the effects of winter-seining by mobile under-ice echo-surveys and catch samples.

In this study, inter- and inner-annual variations of water extent during the period of 1987-2020 were analyzed to understand the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of Dongting Lake. We applied the Multiple Index Water Detection Rule to extract the Dongting Lake water extent quickly and accurately based on Google Earth Engine platform, and then assessed the extraction accuracy. The water surface analysis results showed that (1) based on sustainable development goals (SDG) 6.6.1, the trend of water extent showed the downward fluctuating trend from 1987 to 2020, with the overall average water extent being 1894.48 km(2). (2) Among the monthly average water area, the largest extent was 2477.14km(2) (July) and the smallest was 848.14 km(2) (January). Among the seasonal mean water area, summer was the largest, with an area of 2438.06 km(2), and winter was the smallest at 967.34 km(2). (3) For the water inundation frequency, seasonal water bodies accounted for the largest proportion, with 1577.85 km(2); the nonwater area was the smallest, with the area of 573.02 km(2); and the permanent water area was 1086.21 km(2). Through the analysis of the historical water body extent of the long time series of Dongting Lake, this study reflected support for SDG, for which the research idea and design can help us understand the importance and feasibility of the SDG 6.6.1 indicator.

Plerocercoids were most prevalent (5.3%) in spottail shiners (Notropis hudsonius), the major fish host for Ligula in Daupin Lake. Detailed analysis of the spottail shiner.sbd.Ligula host.sbd.parasite system revealed that the number of plerocercoids differed between years amd among habitats but there was no statisically significant seasonal pattern; recruitment of new worms was highest in young fish and decreased with age, and infected spottails had reduced gonad development. Analysis of host and parasite growth revealed that the soma of male spottails infected with Ligula weighed more but had a reduced growth rate. Growth rate of females was unaffected by Ligula but somatic weight was slightly increased. This appears to be related to the greater metabolic stress on infected males. Based on increased mean somatic weight and skewness of the weight distribution for infected fish, we propose that infected spottails are subjected to size-selective mortality. Some of the contradictions in the literature may be attributed to underestimated prevalence due to increased numbers of spawing fish in the spring, mixed age-classes of Ligula in separate age-classes of fish, and differential effects on growth due to infection in male versus female hosts.

J	Mitchell, RM; Campbell, SK; Qin, Y				Mitchell, R. M.; Campbell, S. K.; Qin, Y.			Recent increase in aerosol loading over the Australian arid zone	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Collocated sun photometer and nephelometer measurements at Tinga Tingana in the Australian Outback over the decade 1997-2007 show a significant increase in aerosol loading following the onset of severe drought conditions in 2002. This increase is confined to the season of dust activity, particularly September to March. In contrast, background aerosol levels during May, June and July remained stable. The enhanced aerosol loadings during the latter 5 years of the study period can be understood as a combination of dune destabilisation through loss of ephemeral vegetation and surface crust, and the changing supply of fluvial sediments to ephemeral lakes and floodplains within the Lake Eyre Basin. Major dust outbreaks are generally highly localised, although significant dust activity was observed at Tinga Tingana on 50% of days when a major event occurred elsewhere in the Lake Eyre Basin, suggesting frequent basinwide dust mobilisation. Combined analysis of aerosol optical depth and scattering coefficient shows weak correlation between the surface and column aerosol (R-2 = 0.24). The aerosol scale height is broadly distributed with a mode typically between 2-3 km, with clearly defined seasonal variation. Climatological analysis reveals bimodal structure in the annual cycle of aerosol optical depth, with a summer peak related to maximal dust activity, and a spring peak related to lofted fine-mode aerosol. There is evidence for an increase in near-surface aerosol during the period 2003-2007 relative to 1997-2002, consistent with an increase in dust activity. This accords with an independent finding of increasing aerosol loading over the Australian region as a whole, suggesting that rising dust activity over the Lake Eyre Basin may be a significant contributor to changes in the aerosol budget of the continent.

Pangong Tso, a similar to 140 km long hypersaline lake, is sensitive to changes in air temperature, precipitation and snow-glacier melt over the southwestern TP. The incised tributaries entering the lake expose deltaic sequences constituting topset, foreset and bottomset. Sedimentology, chronology and diatom analysis of delta sediments; and stable isotopic and sclerochronological analysis of gastropods helped delineate the Late-Holocene variation in lake levels, surface temperature and salinity. The elevation of the topsets is considered as representing past lake high-stands from where molluscs were also recovered. Three phased lake level changes are observed during the past 3 ka. The first high-stand (+1.4-3.0 m) was at similar to 2.8-2.0 ka when lake surface salinity and temperature were 4.67-6.01 ppt (parts per thousand) and 5 degrees C-7 degrees C, respectively, against the modern average values of 7.7 +/- 0.09 ppt and 16.1 degrees C +/- 2.0 degrees C. Followed by a brief decline, another high-stand (+3.0-3.6 m) is observed at 1.1 ka when the salinity is reduced to 4.03-5.72 ppt and lake surface temperature to 5 degrees C8 degrees C. A corresponding increase in freshwater diatom concentration is also observed here. The third phase over the past 1 ka witnessed a fall of similar to 3.6-6 m in lake level that is attributed to an abrupt rise in aridity over the TP. We demonstrate that lake level variation in the region is a function of the variability of the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) and the westerlies, however during the high-stand, the hydrology of the lake was dominated by ISM precipitation.

J	Yang, L; Zhou, LZ; Song, YW				Yang, Ling; Zhou, Lizhi; Song, Yunwei			The effects of food abundance and disturbance on foraging flock patterns of the wintering Hooded Crane (Grus monacha)	AVIAN RESEARCH												Background: Food abundance and availability affect flock patterns of foraging birds. Cost and risk tradeoffs are especially critical for flocks of wintering waterbirds foraging in lake wetlands. Waterbirds losing suitable habitats face insufficient food supplies and high levels of disturbance, affecting their foraging activities. Our objective was to study the effects of food abundance and disturbances on flock size and the structure of Hooded Crane flocks wintering at Shengjin Lake and, as well, to understand the response of wintering waterbirds to habitat degradation for future management decisions and protection of the population. Methods: We investigated food abundance, disturbances and flock foraging activities of the wintering Hooded Crane in several foraging habitats of Shengjin Lake from November 2013 to April 2014. Flock size and structure were observed by scan sampling. Data on food abundance and disturbances were collected by sampling. Flock size and structure were compared among three wintering stages. The relationship between food resources, disturbances and flock size were illustrated using a generalized linear model. Results: In the early and middle wintering periods, the Hooded Crane used paddy fields as its major foraging habitat, where the number of foraging birds and flocks were the highest. During the late period, the cranes took to meadows as their major foraging habitat. The variation among foraging flock was mainly embodied in the size of the flocks, while the age composition of these flocks did not change perceptibly. Family flocks were notably different from flock groups in size and age composition. The results of a generalized linear model showed that the food abundance had a marked effect on foraging flock size and age composition, while disturbances had a significant effect only on flock size. From our analysis, it appeared that the combined effect of the two variables was significant on the size of the foraging flock, but had less impact on age composition. Conclusions: Food abundance and disturbances affected the flock size of the Hooded Crane. With abundant food and high disturbances, flock sizes increased owing to cooperation in foraging. To avoid competition and maximize foraging benefits, flock size reduces with an abundance of food but low disturbance. By trading off risks and costs, the cranes showed flexible flock distributions and a variety of foraging strategies to maximize benefits and to improve their fitness.

P uptake was calculated as the sum of accumulation and release rates. The 10 spp examined ranged in size from 36-.mu.m Codonella cratera to 1-mm Daphnia retrocurva. P uptake rates of herbivorous zooplankton ranged about 200-fold and increased with body size both within and among species, although not proportionally. Among species, there was a pronounced allometry, with smaller species having much higher rates per unit size. This allometry is similar to that described for other metabolic parameters and body size. There was no tendency for smaller species to release a greater fraction of the label they took up. The biomass of zooplankton consuming a given phytoplankton production will be much smaller if smaller zooplankton dominate, and therefore, this P sink will be much smaller. The flow of P to higher trophic levels may be reduced. Changing the zooplankton size-distribution may change the amount of spring total P available to summer phytoplankton.

The Southeast Asian tropics remain severely under-represented in paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic reconstructions, although a few recent paleoclimate studies evaluated the variability, position and strength of the main Asian monsoon systems at different timescales from modern records to the last 15,000 years. Comparable data from Viet Nam, however, are scarce although Viet Nam and its Central Highlands are critically located at the intersection of the East Asian Summer Monsoon and the Indian Summer Monsoon with highly important socio-ecological consequences from changes in the climate system. This study presents a high-resolution sedimentary climate record from Ea Tyn Lake in Viet Nam's Central Highlands covering the last 1250 years. Using geochemical and sedimentological proxies and principal component analysis, we reconstructed at least 12 drought events, some of which appear to be of supraregional significance as they coincide with historically documented droughts in India, China, and Cambodia. Beyond tracking short-term climate events, the Rb/Sr elemental ratio along the Ea Tyn Lake sediment sequence reflects long-term monsoon variability throughout the last millenium, which was previously only reconstructed via delta O-18 speleothem records from China and India. Our Ea Tyn Lake record shows that the East Asian Summer Monsoon was relatively strong between similar to 1000 and 1350 cal CE and weaker between 1350 and 1850 cal CE, followed by renewed intensification after similar to 1850 cal CE.

However, little is known about the predominant drivers and effects of such FABs on lake ecosystems. We observed FABs in a large clear-water lake (Bear Lake, UT/ID, USA) and analyzed long-term lake monitoring data and algal stable isotopes for changes in climate, food webs and anthropogenic nutrient loading, respectively, as potential local drivers of FAB formation. Furthermore, we quantified in situ metabolism rates on rocks with and without FABs at two locations. Long-term monitoring data revealed increasing summer water temperatures (2009 to 2020) and decreasing winter ice cover (1923 to 2021). The FABs had delta N-15 values that were higher than 0 parts per thousand, indicating a potential nutrient influx to Bear Lake from livestock or human waste. Climate change and anthropogenic nutrients may thus have facilitated FAB occurrence. Contrary to expectation, the FABs exhibited significantly lower gross primary production rates compared to low-biomass periphyton communities, indicating potentially negative effects of FAB proliferations on lake food webs. Our results highlight the need for expanding lake monitoring programs to include littoral zones to detect and mitigate changes occurring in lakes.

Although physicochemical properties of sea water and inland water are slightly different, they are similar enough for hyperspectral remote sensing to become an alternative tool for inland lakes monitoring. A field campaign was conducted in the spring and summer 2004 in Michigan, USA. A total of 191 water samples were collected at multiple depths from 46 lakes and were analyzed for Chlorophyll-a, suspended solids, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, Secchi disk transparency, light conditions, and temperature pro files. Geographic locations of the sample sites were recorded, and over 5,000 lake reflectance measurements were collected using it field spectroradiometer. The hyperspectral data were used to specify the regions of wavelengths that best respond to changes of water quality parameters. Principal components analysis (PCA) and regression technique were used to examine the relationship between water quality parameters and spectral reflectance. The quantitative relationship between remotely sensed variables and water quality indicators can be potentially used to extrapolate point-based water quality measurements to large spatial extents for an improved water quality assessment.																					0-7803-9050-4				2005							4531	4534																WOS:000237237606001
J	Cook, CG; Jones, RT				Cook, Charlotte G.; Jones, Richard T.			Palaeoclimate dynamics in continental Southeast Asia over the last ∼30,000 Cal yrs BP	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Although the Asian monsoon is the dominant source of precipitation across continental Southeast Asia, projections of future climate trends in this region remain unclear. This is partly because historic climate records are relatively short, precluding our ability to understand long-term climate dynamics and potential drivers of change. In this synthesis, 17 palaeorecords from sites located in continental Southeast Asia provide a synopsis of regional palaeoclimate dynamics over the last similar to 30,000 Cal yrs BP. The results indicate that over millennial timescales, the dominant control on Asian monsoon intensity is solar insolation linked to orbital changes. From ca. 30 to 11.9 Cal kyr BP, climatic conditions are interpreted to have been cold and arid; most probably dominated by a strong Asian winter monsoon. Marked changes occurred during the Pleistocene-Holocene Transition, including a shift to warmer, wetter climatic conditions at ca. 11.5 Cal kyr BP, which was apparently synchronous across the region. During the early to mid Holocene, warmer, wetter climatic conditions were established, consistent with a strong Asian summer monsoon inferred from the Dongge Cave delta O-18 speleothem record. Intriguingly, contrasting sub-regional palaeoclimatic trends are captured in the synthesis: most notably during the Holocene, possibly due to differing sub-regional climatic and environmental influences (including differences in the role of the Asian monsoon, the Westerlies and/or topographical effects). However, because of uncertainties relating to the age control of many of the palaeorecords, it is not possible to make this interpretation with confidence. Further work involving comprehensive radiocarbon dating of sequences and the development of high-resolution palaeoclimatic reconstructions are urgently required if we are to identify decadal to centennial scale changes across continental Southeast Asia and test hypotheses of synchroneity in the region.

Over a period of 2 years, the meiofaunal population of all three lakes fluctuated greatly, with densities varying up to nine-fold within a season. In the oligotrophic lake, a significant decrease in meiofauna in winter was striking, whereas in the other two lakes, richer in nutrients, there was a pronounced peak in early summer Although the lakes, on average, did not differ in epilithic organic and inorganic material, the differences in meiofaunal abundance, biomass, and production were significant. Correlation analysis revealed that altogether the meiofaunal biomass was positively related to the lakes trophic state (total phosphorus), while the meiofaunal abundance and production along the trophic spectrum displayed a humped-shape distribution, with maximum values measured in the mesotrophic Lake Erken (1324 ind cm(-2) and 2249 mu g DW cm(-2) y(-1)). Nematodes were the dominant meiofaunal group in the epilithon of all three lakes, accounting for up to 58% in abundance, 33% in biomass and 55% in production of the whole meiofaunal community. However their relative importance tended to decrease with increasing trophic state. Beside nematodes, rotifers, oligochaetes, copepods and tardigrades were also found in large numbers in the epilithon. Overall, the results demonstrated that, due to their high abundance, biomass, and production, meiofaunal organisms play an important role in epilithic communities.

Two females banded as nestlings at Eagle Lake, California, were trapped as breeding adults in northern Idaho, a dispersal distance of 809 km. Mean dispersal distance may be greater in the western United States because of the discontinuous distribution of breeding habitat.																			0273-8570	1557-9263				FAL	1991	62	4					517	520																WOS:A1991GY13700014

Case studies on five Italian lakes	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Cyanobacterial blooms occur in many parts of the world as a result of entirely natural causes or human activity. Due to their negative effects on water resources, efforts are made to monitor cyanobacteria dynamics. This study discusses the contribution of remote sensing methods for mapping cyanobacterial blooms in lakes in northern Italy. Semi-empirical approaches were used to flag scum and cyanobacteria and spectral inversion of bio-optical models was adopted to retrieve chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations. Landsat-8 OLI data provided us both the spatial distribution of Chl-a concentrations in a small eutrophic lake and the patchy distribution of scum in Lake Como. ENVISAT MERIS time series collected from 2003 to 2011 enabled the identification of dates when cyanobacterial blooms affected water quality in three small meso-eutrophic lakes in the same region. On average, algal blooms occurred in the three lakes for about 5 days a year, typically in late summer and early autumn. A suite of hyperspectral sensors on air-and space-borne platforms was used to map Chl-a concentrations in the productive waters of the Mantua lakes, finding values in the range of 20 to 100 mgm(-3). The present findings were obtained by applying state of the art of methods applied to remote sensing data. Further research will focus on improving the accuracy of cyanobacteria mapping and adapting the algorithms to the new-generation of satellite sensors.					; Bresciani, Mariano/H-7501-2013; Morabito, Giuseppe/AAY-1223-2020; Lami, Andrea/M-3982-2019; Lauceri, Rosaria/AAY-7197-2020; Giardino, Claudia/O-9923-2015; Lami, Andrea/F-1415-2013; Austoni, Martina/IXD-7503-2023	Lauceri, Rosaria/0000-0002-6370-3980; Austoni, Martina/0000-0002-8214-1442; Cazzaniga, Ilaria/0000-0001-8090-3864; CONGESTRI, Roberta/0000-0002-6288-1638; Matta, Erica/0000-0003-2957-609X; Bresciani, Mariano/0000-0002-7185-8464; Lami, Andrea/0000-0003-3627-0363; 													1129-5767	1723-8633					2017	76			1			127	139		10.4081/jlimnol.2016.1565	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2016.1565													WOS:000429105600013

The maximum quantity of excreted P by fish [Perca flavescens] was negligible (< 0.33%) when compared to the demand for this element by the seston. Zooplankton (cladocerans and copepods) excretion supplied up to 12% of the daily summer orthophosphate requirements of the seston. The pool of total P present in the open water fish community was approximately equivalent to that present in the seston while the total P biomass in zooplankton was only 22-40% of that in the seston. Daily incorporation of total P into fish tissue and losses as fecal P could constitute up to 40% of total P in the seston lost due to sedimentation from the epilimnion depending on the feeding habits of the dominant fish species. Nutrient release due to the decomposition of fish carcasses supplied to to 20% of the allochthonous P entering the south basin in the spring. The prey of the adult fish community is predominantly benthic and littoral in origin. The role of predation in structuring benthic and littoral prey populations and its effect on nutrient dynamics is unknown.

The Wasatch Environmental Observatory: A mountain to urban research network in the semi-arid western US	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The 2085 km(2) Jordan River Basin, and its seven sub-catchments draining the Central Wasatch Range immediately east of Salt Lake City, UT, are home to an array of hydrologic, atmospheric, climatic and chemical research infrastructure that collectively forms the Wasatch Environmental Observatory (WEO). WEO is geographically nested within a wildland to urban land-use gradient and built upon a strong foundation of over a century of discharge and climate records. A 2200 m gradient in elevation results in variable precipitation, temperature and vegetation patterns. Soil and subsurface structure reflect systematic variation in geology from granitic, intrusive to mixed sedimentary clastic across headwater catchments, all draining to the alluvial or colluvial sediments of the former Lake Bonneville. Winter snowfall and spring snowmelt control annual hydroclimate, rapid population growth dominates geographic change in lower elevations and urban gas and particle emissions contribute to episodes of severe air pollution in this closed-basin. Long-term hydroclimate observations across this diverse landscape provide the foundation for an expanding network of infrastructure in both montane and urban landscapes. Current infrastructure supports both basic and applied research in atmospheric chemistry, biogeochemistry, climate, ecology, hydrology, meteorology, resource management and urban redesign that is augmented through strong partnerships with cooperating agencies. These features allow WEO to serve as a unique natural laboratory for addressing research questions facing seasonally snow-covered, semi-arid regions in a rapidly changing world and an excellent facility for providing student education and research training.

Prey size, prey abundance, and temperature as correlates of growth in stream populations of cutthroat trout	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Growth and maximum size of stream fishes can be highly variable across populations. For salmonid fishes in streams, individuals from populations confined to headwater streams often exhibit small size at maturity in comparison to populations with access to main-stem rivers. Differences in prey size, prey availability, and metabolic constraints based on temperature may explain patterns of maximum size and growth. In this study, cutthroat trout from headwater stream populations that were isolated above a waterfall were compared to individuals from populations in similar sized streams without a movement barrier and from large main-stem rivers. Cutthroat trout from smaller streams with or without a movement barrier were significantly smaller at a given age than fish from main-stem rivers, where individuals were able to achieve a much larger maximum size. Comparisons of invertebrate drift abundance and size in the three types of streams revealed that drift size did not differ between stream categories, but was highest per volume of water in large main-stem rivers. Across all stream types, prey abundance declined from summer to fall. Temperature declined over the course of the season in a similar manner across all stream types, but remained relatively high later in the season in main-stem river habitats. Prey availability and temperature conditions in main-stem rivers may provide more optimal growing conditions for fish as individuals increase in size and become constrained by prey availability and temperature conditions in small streams. Maintaining connectivity between small spawning and rearing tributary streams and main-stem river habitats may be critical in maintaining large-bodied populations of stream salmonids.

J	Faye, MS; Diamond, ML				Faye, MS; Diamond, ML			The role of phytoplankton in the removal of arsenic by sedimentation from surface waters	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The role of phytoplankton in the removal of arsenic (As) by particle adsorption and sedimentation was investigated in Moira Lake, Canada. Sampling water and suspended particles over one year illustrated significant variation in As partitioning between particulate and aqueous phases, but failed to establish a correlation between the partition coefficient, Kd, and indicators of phytoplankton biomass. A highly significant inverse logarithmic relationship was noted between K-d and the concentration of suspended particles (log K-d = 5.1-1.4 log SS; p = 0.0001) in an apparent demonstration of the particle concentration effect (O'Connor & Connolly, 1980). Particle deposition, measured by means of sediment traps, appeared to include a substantial component of resuspended surficial sediment making sediment trap results unreliable for quantifying the removal of substances from the water column. The As concentration of particles from deep traps deployed during late summer and early fall exceeded the As concentrations of suspended particles and surficial sediment, and may indicate that a highly contaminated nepheloid layer acts as a temporary sink for As.

Cladoceran body size distributions along temperature and trophic gradients in the conterminous USA	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Body size is an important functional trait that can be indicative of ecosystem structure and constraints on growth. Both increasing temperatures and eutrophication of lakes have been associated with a shift toward smaller zooplankton taxa. This is important in the context of climate change, as most aquatic habitats are expected to warm over the coming decades. Our study uses data from over 1000 lakes surveyed across a range of latitudes (26-49 degrees N) and surface temperatures (10-35 degrees C) in the USA during the spring/summer of 2012 to characterize pelagic cladoceran body size distributions. We used univariate and multiple regression modeling to determine which environmental parameters were strongly correlated to cladoceran body size. A strong positive correlation was observed between cladoceran body size and latitude, while a strong negative correlation was observed between cladoceran body size and water temperature. The ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton, as well as relative total biomass contributions by cladocerans, decreased as trophic state increased. Multiple regression identified temperature-related variables and water clarity as significantly affecting cladoceran body size. These observations demonstrate the dual threat of climate change and eutrophication on lake ecosystems and highlight potential changes in biogeographical patterns of zooplankton as lakes warm.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				NOV-DEC	2020	42	6					613	629		10.1093/plankt/fbaa053	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbaa053													WOS:000595482600002
J	Dasgupta, S; Ghosh, P				Dasgupta, Sanghita; Ghosh, Parthasarathi			Freshwater carbonates within a Late Triassic siliciclastic fluvial system in a Gondwana rift basin: The Maleri Formation, India	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Spring-related carbonates are valuable repositories for information on physical and biotic environments of the past. However, for Mesozoic and earlier records, their use is limited due to their low preservation potential and difficulties in accurate identification of the carbonate type. This study aims to characterise the source of carbonate clasts preserved as thin beds of cross-bedded grainstones in Late Triassic, siliciclastic fluvial deposits, the Maleri Formation, Pranhita-Godavari rift basin, India. The microfabric and stable isotopic compositions of the grainstones and thin and discontinuous beds of impure limestones of this formation are presented here. These features help in identifying the freshwater carbonate-precipitating environments that existed in an ancient continental rift basin, though such deposits are not primarily preserved in this case. The microfabric of the carbonate grains provides evidence for carbonate precipitation in aquatic environment related to karstic springs. Taking together the microfabric, stable isotopic compositions, as well as the associated geological and palaeontological information, it could be shown that the calcium carbonate precipitation took place in palustrine pools related to tufa-like spring systems and in alluvial swamps under a pluvial climatic setting. This research, thus, demonstrates that carbonate grains derived from spring-related carbonate deposits, formed mainly near the margins of rift basins, can be incorporated into nearby siliciclastics. If interpreted correctly, they can be used in reconstructing ancient karstic carbonate environments, even when in situ primary record is not preserved- therefore making it possible to access the information stored in freshwater carbonates.

Anders			Influences of environmental cues, migration history, and habitat familiarity on partial migration	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY												The factors that drive partial migration in organisms are not fully understood. Roach (Rutilus rutilus), a freshwater fish, engage in partial migration where parts of populations switch between summer habitats in lakes and winter habitats in connected streams. To test if the partial migration trait is phenotypically plastic or has genetic components, we translocated roach from 2 populations with different opportunities for migration to a lake with migration opportunity, containing a local roach population. This enabled monitoring of partial migration of fish in 3 different situations: 1) previous opportunity for migration, migrating in a familiar environment (the local population); 2) previous opportunity for migration, migrating in an unfamiliar environment; and 3) no previous opportunity for seasonal migration, migrating in an unfamiliar environment. In addition, we evaluated the migration patterns of roach in the lake with migration opportunity where from group 2 fish were translocated. Directional migration in and out of the lakes was monitored using Passive Integrated Transponder technology. Translocated fish with previous migration opportunity showed migration patterns more similar to local fish than to their home lake population, and individuals translocated from the lake without migration opportunity migrated when given the opportunity, suggesting that partial migration is phenotypically plastic and triggered by lake-specific environmental cues. We found temperature to be a proximate cue for migration decisions. Individuals without previous migration opportunity migrated at a lower proportion and with different small-scale migration patterns, suggesting that also genetic components are involved in the expression of the partial migration trait.					; Nilsson, Anders/H-6836-2014; Skov, Christian/X-6511-2019; Nielsen, Einar/AAT-1737-2021; Baktoft, Henrik/E-6581-2011; Aarestrup, Kim/AAK-9155-2021; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022	Eg Nielsen, Einar/0000-0002-7009-9814; Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; Nilsson, Anders/0000-0002-3541-9835; Skov, Christian/0000-0002-8547-6520; Baktoft, Henrik/0000-0002-3644-4960; Aarestrup, Kim/0000-0001-8521-6270; 													1045-2249	1465-7279				NOV-DEC	2010	21	6					1140	1146		10.1093/beheco/arq121	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arq121													WOS:000284429100003

The effect of hydrothermal spring weathering processes and primary productivity on lithium isotopes: Lake Myvatn, Iceland	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY					Fall AGU Conference on Deciphering Isotope Signatures of Earth Surface and Critical Zone Processes	DEC, 2014	San Francisco, CA	AGU				Lithium isotopes are rapidly becoming one of the most useful tracers of silicate weathering processes, but little is known on their behaviour in groundwaters and hydrothermal springs, and how these sources might influence the weathering signal in surface waters. This study presents lithium isotope compositions (delta Li-7) for cold ground-waters (3-7 degrees C) and hydrothermal springs that were at geothermal temperatures (200-300 degrees C) but have cooled during transport (17-44 degrees C). Both represent an important source of water and nutrients for Lake Myvatn, Iceland. We also present a time-series from the Laxa River, which is the single outflow from the lake. The delta Li-7 values in the input springs to Lake Myvatn are highly variable (5-27%circle),and correlate inversely with temperature and total dissolved solids. These co-variations imply that even in such waters, the processes controlling delta Li-7 variations during weathering still operate: that is, the ratio of primary rock dissolution to secondary mineral formation, where the latter preferentially incorporates Li-6 with a temperature-dependent fractionation factor. In high-temperature geothermal waters (>300 degrees C) secondary mineral formation is inhibited, and has a low fractionation factor, leading to little delta Li-7 fractionation. Even in waters that have cooled considerably over several months from their geothermal temperatures, fractionation is still low, and delta Li-7 values are similar to those reported from waters measured at >350 degrees C. In contrast, cooler groundwaters promote relatively high proportions of clay formation, which scavenge dissolved solids (including 6(L)i). The time series on the Laxa River, the single outflow from Lake Myvatn, shows little delta Li-7 variation with time over the 12 month sampling period (17-21%circle), demonstrating that in contrast to tracers such as Si-isotopes, Li isotopes are unaffected by the significant seasonal phytoplankton blooms that occur in the lake. Thus, these results clearly illustrate that Li isotopes are ideally suited to constrain silicate weathering processes, because fractionation by secondary mineral formation operates even when groundwater and hydrothermal inputs are significant, and because Li isotopes are demonstrably unaffected by phytoplankton or plant growth.

Impact of Dreissena fouling on the physiological condition of native and invasive bivalves: interspecific and temporal variations	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The impact of Dreissena fouling on unionids has hardly been studied in Europe, despite the fact that in some ecosystems (e.g. Lake Balaton, Hungary) infestations of several hundreds to a thousand individuals per unionid have been observed. At present, the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha is a dominant species in Lake Balaton and in the last decade three other invasive bivalves were introduced, potentially increasing the pressure on native unionid survival. We examined whether the fouling of dreissenids (zebra and quagga (D. rostriformis bugensis) mussels) has a negative impact on native (Anodonta anatina, Unio pictorum and U. tumidus) and invasive (Corbicula fluminea and Sinanodonta woodiana) bivalves and whether there are any interspecific and temporal variations in fouling intensity and physiological condition measured by standard condition index and glycogen content. A significant negative impact was detected on native unionids only in July and September (no impact was detected in May), when the fouling rate was high. For invasive species, a significant negative impact was detected on S. woodiana with a high level of dressenid infestation; whereas no significant impact was detected on C. fluminea. Overall, this study confirms that Dreissena may threaten unionid species including the invasive S. woodiana, although high interspecific and temporal variations were observed. This situation should be taken into account in future ecological and conservational assessments because species respond differently to Dreissena fouling and effects seem to be more pronounced in late summer/early autumn. In addition, this study provides the first evidence that the invasive C. fluminea appear to be less vulnerable to dressenid fouling.					; Sousa, Ronaldo/C-4887-2008	Sousa, Ronaldo/0000-0002-5961-5515; 													1387-3547	1573-1464				JUL	2014	16	7					1373	1386		10.1007/s10530-013-0575-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-013-0575-z													WOS:000338445000005
J	MURRAY, TE; RICH, PH				MURRAY, TE; RICH, PH			RESPIRATORY QUOTIENTS PREDICT INCREASES IN REDUCING PRODUCTS IN THE HYPOLIMNION OF A STRATIFIED LAKE	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The benthic respiration of Crystal Lake, Connecticut, was modeled with two respiratory quotients, the volumetric respiratory quotient (VRQ) and the fundamental respiratory quotient (FRQ). The VRQ is defined as the quotient of the increase in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIG) and the decrease in dissolved oxygen (DO) resulting from respiration at a given depth. Those changes are relative to concentrations determined early in spring. The FRQ is the slope of the regression of DIC against DO at all depths not chronically anoxic. Respiratory quotients describe the predominance of anaerobic over aerobic metabolism and should, therefore, predict the accumulation of the products of anaerobic metabolism (i.e., Fe2+, H2S). VRQs successfully predicted the increase in reduced products in the hypolimnion of Crystal Lake. FRQs successfully predicted the rate of increase of reduced products early in stratification. FRQ was unsuccessful in predicting the continued accumulation of reducing products later in the summer, which may reflect a steady state between the production of DIC and reduced products and the diffusion of oxygen across the thermocline, or may reflect methodological constraints imposed by the calculation of FRQ. Both models were successful to a limited extent in predicting the accumulation of the products of anaerobic metabolism.																			0706-652X					JUN	1995	52	6					1183	1189		10.1139/f95-114	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f95-114													WOS:A1995TA79400005

Incorporating Industrial and Climatic Covariates into Analyses of Fish Health Indicators Measured in a Stream in Canada's Oil Sands Region	ENVIRONMENTS												Industrial and other human activities in Canada's oil sands region (OSR) influence the environment. However, these impacts can be challenging to separate from natural stresses in flowing waters by comparing upstream reference sites to downstream exposure locations. For example, health indicators of lake chub (Couesius plumbeus) compared between locations in the Ells River (Upper and Lower) in 2013 to 2015 and 2018 demonstrated statistical differences. To further examine the potential sources of variation in fish, we also analyzed data at sites over time. When fish captured in 2018 were compared to pooled reference years (2013-2015), results indicated multiple differences in fish, but most of the differences disappeared when environmental covariates were included in the Elastic Net (EN) regularized regression models. However, when industrial covariates were included separately in the EN, the large differences in 2018 also disappeared, also suggesting the potential influence of these covariables on the health of fish. Further ENs incorporating both environmental and industrial covariates along with other variables which may describe industrial and natural influences, such as spring or summer precipitation and summer wind speeds and distance-based penalty factors, also support some of the suspected and potential mechanisms of impact. Further exploratory analyses simulating changes from zero and the mean (industrial) activity levels using the regression equations respectively suggest effects exceeding established critical effect sizes (CES) for fish measurements may already be present or effects may occur with small future changes in some industrial activities. Additional simulations also suggest that changing regional hydrological and thermal regimes in the future may also cause changes in fish measurements exceeding the CESs. The results of this study suggest the wide applicability of the approach for monitoring the health of fish in the OSR and beyond. The results also suggest follow-up work required to further evaluate the veracity of the suggested relationships identified in this analysis.																				2076-3298				JUN	2022	9	6							73	10.3390/environments9060073	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/environments9060073													WOS:000816450300001

This study evaluated (i) the spatial distribution of bovine (cow) and porcine (pig) genetic fecal markers, (ii) how hydrologic factors influenced these genetic markers, and (iii) their variations as a function of land use, nutrients, and other physiochemical factors. We collected 189 samples from 63 watersheds in Michigan's Lower Peninsula during baseflow, spring melt, and summer rain conditions. For each sample, we quantified the concentrations of bovine and porcine genetic markers by digital droplet polymerase chain reaction and measured Escherichia coli, dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, nitrate-nitrite (NOX), ammonia (NH3), soluble reactive phosphorus, streamflow, and watershed specific precipitation. Bovine and porcine manure markers were ubiquitous in rivers that drain agricultural and natural fields across the study region. This study provides baseline conditions on the state of watershed impairment, which can be used to develop best management practices that could improve water quality. Similar studies should be performed with higher spatial sampling density to elucidate detailed factors that influence the transport of manure constituents.

Climate and climate variability of the wind power resources in the Great Lakes region of the United States	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The climate and climate variability of low-level winds over the Great Lakes region of the United States is examined using 30 year (1979-2008) wind records from the recently released North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), a three-dimensional, high-spatial and temporal resolution, and dynamically consistent climate data set. The analyses focus on spatial distribution and seasonal and interannual variability of wind speed at 80 m above the ground, the hub height of the modern, 77 m diameter, 1500 kW wind turbines. The daily mean wind speeds exhibit a large seasonal variability, with the highest mean wind speed (similar to 6.58 m s (1)) in November through January and the lowest (similar to 4.72 m s (1)) in July and August. The spatial variability of the annual mean winds is small across the entire region and is dominated by land-water contrasts with stronger winds over the lake surface than over land. Larger interannual variability is found during the winter months, whereas smaller variations occur in mid to late summer. The interannual variability appears to have some connections to El Nino-Southern Oscillation, with lower mean wind speeds and more frequent occurrences of lulls during major El Nino episodes. Above-normal ice cover of the Great Lakes appears to be associated with slightly lower wind speeds and vice versa. According to NARR data and the criteria established by wind energy industry, the areas over Lake Superior, Michigan, and Ontario appear to be rich in wind resources, but most land areas in the region are either unsuitable or marginal for potential wind energy development.

The results revealed that the phytoplankton biomass showed a significant single peak (mean of 30 mg/L) during May-July. The predominant genera showed significant seasonal succession, with the peak value of diatom biomass appearing in late spring and the peak value of cyanobacterial biomass appearing at early summer. Upon reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus, the biomass of phytoplankton in the reservoir decreased drastically. Based on correlation analysis and ordination analysis, biomass of the dominant genera showed significant positive relationships to temperature. The biomass of three dominant genera of Bacillariophyta, Cyclotella, Synedra, and Achnanthes, were significantly and positively related to ammonium concentration, while the biomass of three dominant genera from Cyanophyta, Aphanizomenon, Phormidium, and Raphidiopsis, were significantly and positively correlated to dissolved total P concentration. The results suggested that the phytoplankton biomass in Shahe Reservoir was mainly controlled by climatic factors, such as temperature and precipitation. However, N and P also had a strong influence on biomass and population structure of the phytoplankton as well as on proliferation of blooms. To avoid algal blooms in reservoirs located in southeast China, we suggest that both N and P should be reduced to grade II level of the Chinese surface water standard; more specifically, total N needs to be lower than 0.50 mg/L and total P needs to be lower than 0.025 mg/L.

The canopy effect in filamentous algae: Improved modeling of Cladophora growth via a mechanistic representation of self-shading	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												For decades, nuisance algal growth has wreaked havoc in systems across the world. It has been particularly problematic in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Although managing nutrient loads has resulted in some mitigation, ecosystem perturbations in the last two decades have resulted in favorable conditions for a Cladophora resurgence. This paper reports on improvements to the Great Lakes Cladophora Model, which has been used to inform management of Great Lakes nuisance algal growth since it was first developed over 30 years ago (Auer et al., 1982; Auer and Canale, 1982; Canale and Auer, 1982a,b). Like earlier versions, this recent configuration of the model, GLCM v3, simulates algal biomass density (g dry mass m(-2)) and stored (or cellular) phosphorus content (P as % dry mass) over the spring, summer and fall growth cycle. Two major advances over previous versions of the model are presented: a) an improved characterization of the light and temperature response surfaces driving gross growth and respiration and b) the development and implementation of a segmented-system (canopy) approach for simulating the impact of self-shading (carrying capacity) on growth. Prior versions of the GLCM treated the algal mat as a lumped system, utilizing the logistic model to simulate the carrying capacity effect. In that approach, a carrying capacity coefficient (X-max, maximum biomass density) placed a ceiling on biomass accrual. However, that approach was not mechanistic (i.e., physiologically supported) and empirical specification of the coefficient is undermined by significant intra- and inter-site variability. This uncertainty places too much emphasis on X-max as a tuning parameter. The signal contribution of this work to the development of the GLCM v3 is the replacement of the lumped system approach with a vertically segmented, mechanistic treatment of self-shading: the "canopy effect." Here, biomass accrual is mechanistically governed by light attenuation through the canopy as quantified by k(alg), the vertical extinction coefficient for light passing through the mat. This coefficient may be determined by direct, in situ measurement and offers much less freedom for use as a tuning parameter. The advances in Cladophora growth modeling provided here and embodied in the GLCM v3 offer a more mechanistic and robust tool than previous versions, strengthening its credibility for the management of nuisance algal growth such as that mandated by the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 2012. Further, the vertical determination of net growth provides a more mechanistic basis for future modeling of other key processes such as sloughing (detachment) in both the Great Lakes and other natural waterbodies.

In this paper, we study sulphate deposition change over time in a network of multiple monitoring stations in the Turkey Lakes Watershed in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada. As there is generally substantial correlation among sulphate deposition observed over time and space, we incorporate temporally correlated multivariate random effects into Gamma regression models to account for the temporal dependence within each station and between-station dependence in space. We applied our new approach to analyse monthly average sulphate depositions between 1983 and 2003. We found the observed increase of sulphate deposition between 1994 and 2003 was not significant, that is, annual trends in sulphate deposition had stabilized since 1994. Our analysis also quantified increasing sulphate deposition from upstream to downstream and its monthly fluctuations from higher in winter to lower in summer. Understanding of these sulphate deposition trends is of great policy relevance to environmental conservation.

J	Luo, LC; Wen, HG; Li, Y; You, YX; Luo, XT				Luo, Lianchao; Wen, Huaguo; Li, Yi; You, Yaxian; Luo, Xiaotong			Mineralogical, crystal morphological, and isotopic characteristics of smooth slope travertine deposits at Reshuitang, Tengchong, China	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Reshuitang is an important active hydrothermal area in the Tengchong geothermal field and is characterized by many hot springs and their associated deposits. Detailed mineralogical, crystal morphological, and stable isotopic investigations of the smooth slope fossil travertines at Reshuitang and hydrochemical studies of two active springs around the fossil travertines were conducted to study their genesis. The results show that 1) the modern springs discharge waters with high temperature (>70 degrees C), near-neutral pH (6.3-834), and high saturation indices of calcite and aragonite; 2) the fossil travertines contain calcite and small amounts of Mn-Fe oxides, halite, thenardite, and non-carbonate debris; 3) the calcite include ray crystals, dendrite crystals, platy crystals, and spike crystals; and 4) beta C-13 and delta O-18 of the fossil travertines at Reshuitang range from -1.59%. to -0.87%. and 6.48 parts per thousand to 7.80 parts per thousand, respectively. According to comparison between the travertines at Reshuitang and other travertines in Tengchong, all these travertines are thermogene travertines, with a large contribution of mantle degassing to their parent CO2, but are formed at different temperatures. The fossil travertines at Reshuitang, similar to those at Shuzhishi, are formed at high temperatures (near 100 degrees C), which results in weak microbial activities during the formation of the fossil travertines. Most of the calcite crystals at Reshuitang were non-equilibrium products precipitated directly from the spring waters during the deposition process, while the spike crystals originated from diagenetic dissolution of large calcite crystals. Comparison between the fossil travertines at Reshuitang and other smooth slope travertines from other areas shows these smooth slope travertines have different lithofacies and fabrics. In smooth slope environments, temperature may control the distribution and development of microbes and the intensity of CO2 degassing, and consequently cause the precipitation of contrasting fabrics and lithofacies.

Phosphate concentrations were low, N:P ratios were high, and phosphate losses converted into carbon accounted for <50% of phytoplankton biomass and production, indicating that P was limiting phytoplankton development during the study. The observed low availability of P contrasts with the high release of "directly" assimilable P often reported in newly flooded reservoirs, suggesting that factors determining nutrient dynamics in such ecosystems are complex. The phosphate availability, but also the water column stability, seemed to be among the major factors determining phytoplankton dynamics, as (i) large-size phytoplankton species were prominent during the period of increasing water column stability, whereas small-size species dominated phytoplankton assemblages during the period of decreasing stability, and (ii) a Dinobryon divergens bloom occurred during a period when inorganic P was undetectable, coinciding with the lowest values of bacterial standing stocks. Indication of grazing limitation of bacterial populations by the mixotrophic chrysophyte D. divergens (in late spring) and by other potential grazers (mainly rotifers in summer) seemed to be confirmed by the Model II or functional slopes of the bacterial vs phytoplankton regressions, which were always <0.63. Phytoplankton biomass was not correlated with phosphorus sources and its contribution was remarkably low relative to the living microbial biomass which, in contrast, was positively correlated with total phosphorus in summer. We conclude that planktonic microheterotrophs are strongly implicated in the phosphorus dynamics in the Sep Reservoir, and thus support the idea that an important amount of matter and energy flows through the "microbial loop" and food web, shortly after the flooding of a reservoir.					; Sime-Ngando, Télesphore/M-4134-2019	Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/0000-0002-7240-5803; 													0095-3628	1432-184X				JAN	2002	43	1					67	81		10.1007/s00248-001-1015-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-001-1015-7								11984630					WOS:000174896300007

Seven of the 15 turtles tagged initially in 1997 returned to the same river hibernaculum in 1998. SCUBA observation demonstrated that hibernating females clustered together shell to shell in small and large groups often piled upon one another. They wintered fully exposed (unburied) but frequently positioned themselves against bottom debris (rocks, ledge outcrops, submerged logs). Ice covered the river from December through March. Zn April, when the ice had thawed, the animals emigrated to their summer home ranges. Range length for 6 females was 1.5 - 8.0 km along the river course. Total movements outside the hibernaculum ranged from 3.1 - 15.4 km. Some individuals moved downstream to Lake Champlain (2.7 km) and along the lakeshore as much as 2.2 km from the river's mouth. One individual moved 5.8 km upstream, then headed 9.5 km downstream to the lake before returning to the hibernaculum.																			0008-3550					JUL-SEP	2000	114	3					405	408																WOS:000166309600006

These cut-off meanders resulted in oxbow lakes that are important locations for nature conservation. We collected water samples over 5 years in 7 campaigns to measure the delta O-18 (parts per thousand) and delta H-2 (parts per thousand) ratios in 45 oxbow lakes from the Upper Tisza Region (NE-Hungary). We applied Random Forest Regression involving climatic data to reveal the connection with the stable isotopes. We determined that isotope ratios changed as a function of time, due to evaporation and a varying water supply (precipitation and groundwater). The average difference in the isotopic ratios for the river and oxbows increased from spring to winter, but decreased between the oxbows on both sides of the dyke. We found that isotope ratios were determined by the maximum monthly temperature in the case of oxbows in the active floodplain, whereas in case of oxbows on the reclaimed side, this was also influenced by the maximum monthly temperature, and the cumulative evaporation. As direct measurement of evaporation is difficult to evaluate, stable isotope measurements provided an effective quantitative alternative to estimate evaporation. Measuring the seasonality of the delta O-18 and delta H-2 is important to interpret the results and these data are useful to water management experts to identify the lakes at risk of running dry.

Its freshwater systems are dominated by a low energy environment and cold region processes. Central northern areas are almost totally influenced by arctic air masses while Pacific air becomes more prominent in the west, Atlantic air in the east and southern air masses at the lower latitudes. Air mass changes will play an important role in precipitation changes associated with climate warming. The snow season in the region is prolonged resulting in long-term storage of water so that the spring flood is often the major hydrological event of the year, even though, annual rainfall usually exceeds annual snowfall. The unique character of ponds and lakes is a result of the long frozen period, which affects nutrient status and gas exchange during the cold season and during thaw. GCM models are in close agreement for this region and predict temperature increases as large as 4 degrees C in summer and 9 degrees C in winter for a 2 x CO? scenario. Palaeoclimate indicators support the probability that substantial temperature increases have occurred previously during the Holocene. The historical record indicates a temperature increase of >1 degrees C in parts of the region during the last century. GCM predictions of precipitation change indicate an increase, but there is little agreement amongst the various models on regional disposition or magnitude. Precipitation change is as important as temperature change in determining the water balance. The water balance is critical to every aspect of hydrology and limnology in the far north. Permafrost close to the surface plays a major role in freshwater systems because it often maintains lakes and wetlands above an impermeable frost table, which limits the water storage capabilities of the subsurface. Thawing associated with climate change would, particularly in areas of massive ice, stimulate landscape changes, which can affect every aspect of the environment. The normal spring flooding of ice-jammed north-flowing rivers, such as the Mackenzie, is a major event, which renews the water supply of lakes in delta regions and which determines the availability of habitat for aquatic organisms. Climate warming or river damming and diversion would probably lead to the complete drying of many delta lakes. Climate warning would also change the characteristics of ponds that presently freeze to the bottom and result in fundamental changes in their limnological characteristics. At present, the food chain is rather simple usually culminating in lake trout or arctic char. A lengthening of the growing season and warmer water temperature would affect the chemical, mineral and nutrient status of lakes and most likely have deleterious effects on the food chain. Peatlands are extensive in region 2. They would move northwards at their southern boundaries, and, with sustained drying, many would change form or become inactive, Extensive wetlands and peatlands are an important component of the global carbon budget, and warmer and drier conditions would most likely change them from a sink to a source for atmospheric carbon. There is some evidence that this may be occurring already. Region 2 is very vulnerable to global warming. Its freshwater systems are probably the least studied and most poorly understood in North America. There are clear needs to improve our current knowledge of temperature and precipitation patterns; to model the thermal behaviour of wetlands, lakes and rivers; to understand better the interrelationships of cold region rivers with their basins; to begin studies on the very large lakes in the region; to obtain a firm grasp of the role of northern peatlands in the global carbon cycle; and to link the terrestrial water balance to the thermal and hydrological regime of the polar sea. Overall there is a strong need for basic research and long-term monitoring.

Production of a small number of large eggs maximizes female fitness under poor food conditions, as does a large number of small eggs under rich food conditions. Gnathopogon caerulescens (Honmoroko) spawns over a wide range of water temperature from spring to summer. Thus, we determined whether or not egg size varied with water temperature and how egg size influenced hatchling size at different water temperature. Changes in egg size strongly correlated with seasonal changes in water temperature around the lake, regardless of time and area. An experiment using eggs from the lake indicated that hatchling size has a significant positive relationship with egg size in water temperatures of 24 A degrees C. On the other hand, a lower incubation temperature, similar to that likely to be encountered at the beginning of the spawning season, resulted in a smaller hatchling size, eggs requiring a longer time to hatch. At the beginning of the spawning season, therefore, egg size may have a lesser impact on hatching size in the natural environment of Honmoroko because of the relatively lower temperatures. Although fish larvae below a certain threshold of effective body size are generally not expected to have a high early survival rate due to, for example, a lower competitive ability or a high susceptibility to predation, seasonal egg size variation in Honmoroko may be adaptive so as to enhance the likehood of early survival by establishing an effective body size under changing water temperature conditions.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				APR	2015	98	4					1151	1161		10.1007/s10641-014-0348-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-014-0348-2													WOS:000350567300017
J	Paragamian, VL; Powell, MS; Faler, JC				Paragamian, VL; Powell, MS; Faler, JC			Mitochondrial DNA analysis of burbot stocks in the Kootenai River Basin of British Columbia, Montana, and Idaho	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Differences in mitochondrial haplotype frequency were examined among burbot Lota lota collected from four areas within the Kootenai River Basin of British Columbia, Montana and Idaho. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify three gene regions of the mitochondrial genome: NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1), NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2), and NADH dehydrogenase subunits 5 and 6 combined (ND5,6). Amplified DNA was screened for restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). Simple haplotypes resulting from RFLPs in a single gene region were combined into composite haplotypes. The distribution of composite haplotypes and their frequencies correspond to areas of the Kootenay River basin above and below a presumptive geographic barrier, Kootenai Falls, Montana, and suggest spatially segregated populations. A test of geographic heterogeneity among haplotype frequency distributions was highly significant (P < 0.001) when a Monte Carlo simulation was used to approximate a chi(2) test. Two populations, one above and one below Kootenai Falls emerged when a neighbor-joining method was used to infer a phylogenetic tree based on estimates of nucleotide divergence between ail pairs of sample locations. These analyses indicate that burbot below Kootenai Falls form a separate genetic group from burbot above the falls and further suggests that Libby Dam, which created Lake Koocanusa, is not an effective barrier segregating burbot above Kootenai Falls. Management implications from these findings are that mitigative efforts in the Kootenai River Basin must address the needs of two genetically divergent burbot stocks, and that a unification of angling regulations for the population downstream of Kootenai Falls in Idaho and British Columbia is warranted.

However, these proxy indicators often show controversial characteristics in terms of trends and rhythms, leading to perplexedunderstanding of orbital-scale monsoon dynamics. Here we review the orbital-scale monsoon variability and dynamics in East Asia by comparing multiple proxies from loess, lake, speleothem, and marine records with the HadCM3 modeling result. Evolutionary power spectra of loess grain size and sea surface temperature exhibit a remarkable shift from 41- to 100-kyr cycles across the mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT), whereas other proxy records (e.g. 813C of loess carbonate, pollen concentration in lake sediments, and magnetic mineral compositions in marine sediments) display distinct and persistent precession cycles through the Quaternary, along with strong 10 0-kyr cycles after the MPT. Simulations with the HadCM3 climate model reveal that the effects of orbital parameters, ice volume, and CO2 concentration on the temperature, precipitation, and southerly winds are seasonally and spatially different in East Asia. In the summer season, orbitally induced insolation plays a dominant role in driving changes in these three climate variables except for summer precipitation in south China (20-30??N), whilst annual changes in precipitation and temperature are jointly affected by insolation, ice volume, and CO2. Proxy-model comparison suggests that several land-based proxies are sensitive to changes in summer precipitation, annual precipitation, and annual temperature, though their responses to astronomical, ice, and CO2 forcing being quite different between north and south China. Our proxy-model comparison reveals that diverse expression of Quaternary climate periodicities was provoked by different sensitivities of marine and terrestrial proxies to seasonal and/or annual changes in precipitation and temperature, and by different responses of temperature and precipitation to insolation and ice/CO2 forcing. We suggest that understanding of Quaternary climate change can be deepened by further comparison of quantitatively reconstructed paleotemperature and precipitation data with high-resolution regional climate modeling results. 0 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the Zn isotope composition in the lake ecosystems has not been well characterized. In order to resolve this problem, we investigate the Zn isotope compositions of suspended particulate matter (SPM) and biological samples collected from the Aha Lake and Hongfeng Lake, and their tributaries in summer and winter, aiming to explore the potential of this novel isotope system as a proxy for biogeochemical processes in aqueous environments. Concentration of dissolved Zn ranges from 0.65 to 5.06 mu g/L and 0.74 to 12.04 mu g/L for Aha Lake and Hongfeng Lake, respectively, while Zn (SPM) ranges from 0.18 to 0.70 mg/g and 0.24 to 0.75 mg/g for Aha Lake and Hongfeng Lake, respectively. The Zn isotope composition in SPM from Aha Lake and its main tributaries ranges from -0.18 parts per thousand to 0.27 parts per thousand and -0.17 parts per thousand to 0.46 parts per thousand, respectively, and it varies from -0.29 parts per thousand to 0.26 parts per thousand and -0.04 parts per thousand to 0.48 parts per thousand, respectively in Hongfeng Lake and its main tributaries, displaying a wider range in tributaries than lakes. These results imply that Zn isotope compositions are mainly affected by tributaries inputting into Aha Lake, while adsorption process by algae is the major factor for the Zn isotope composition in Hongfeng Lake, and ZnS precipitation leads to the light Zn isotope composition of SPM in summer. These data and results provide the basic information of the Zn isotope for the lake ecosystem, and promote the application of Zn isotope in biogeochemistry.

The traditional understanding of lake ice growth and evolution through a winter period is the downward progression of ice until air temperatures rise and melt, and breakup ensues. A unique meteorological condition of substantial mid-winter warming in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies allowed for the identification of a phenomenon where a liquid water layer was trapped between ice layers near the surface of a lake. Phytoplankton analysis identified that the interstitial water layer had a bloom of motile phytoplankton belonging to the order Chlamydomonadales. Stable isotopes suggest the upward movement of pelagic water in combination with landscape runoff contributed to the formation of the interstitial water layer. This study provides new insights and illustrates the complexities involved in understanding the physicochemical and biological mechanisms involved in shaping the winter ecology, as well as subsequent ice-free periods, of lakes under a changing climate.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					2025	82								0009	10.1139/cjfas-2025-0009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2025-0009													WOS:001530389700001

Yamkun spring is known as one of the few radioactive springs in Transbaikal region. Its waters were used for the treatment of Kaschin-Beck disease (Urov disease), nowadays the regional center of medical rehabilitation for the treatment of diseases of the musculoskeletal and nervous systems, including cerebral palsy, and diseases of the skin is working on the basis of this spring. The main aim of the research is to identify mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of Yamkun spring components. Objects: lake and stream water, travertines, ferruginous sediments in the stream bed, salt sediments on the tube of soak well, vegetation (lichens, mosses, pine straw, poplar leaves). Methods: inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry, instrumental neutron activation analysis, X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy. Results. Water of Yamkun spring is bicarbonate, calcium-magnesium, radioactive of radon nature. It is significantly enriched in Mn, Fe, Be, As, Zr, Cs, Hg, Tl, Li, Co and Ba relative to water of Lake Baikal. Water enrichment with rare alkaline and alkaline-earth elements (Li, Be, Cs), as well as Hg, Tl, As and Zr suggests that their source is rare-metal granitoids. During water discharge we observed modern mineral formation on the surface of water baths as "Yamkun foam" (aragonite), tubes of soak well (nesquehonite) and in the stream (ferruginous sediments). Ferruginous sediments and travertines are represented mainly with magnesian calcite. In the ferruginous sediments we identified in large quantities Fe and Mn compounds, probably hydroxides. The hydroxides of Mn also include Ba, K, Cl compounds, Fe hydroxides - As, P, Si, Al. Rare microinclusions in the travertines are represented with intermetallic phases of Cu and Sn, La-Ce carbonate and As sulphide (loellingite?). The inheritance of composition of modern ferruginous sediments and travertines is established. The forming travertines are enriched with the same elements as the water in the spring.

S. blizzard of 1-2 February 2011	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												A major central U. S. winter cyclone on 1-2 February 2011 produced a band of high winds, up to 75 cm of snow, and numerous reports of thundersnow from Oklahoma into Ontario over a 26 h period. The National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) recorded 282 flashes comprised of 1153 events which were >96% negative polarity. Hopes of imaging winter sprites associated with energetic positive cloud-to-ground events that sometimes accompany such winter storms did not materialize. However, the lack of lightning over the Great Lakes waters, plus media reports of numerous thundersnow events in downtown Chicago, prompted a detailed analysis of the NLDN data. This revealed that >93% of all lightning in the snow band was likely or possibly associated with self-initiated upward lightning (SIUL) events from a variety of tall, and some not so tall, structures. In addition to 43 events from two Chicago skyscrapers, many shorter structures were involved, including wind turbines (13.1% of the total) and transmission line towers (6.7%). Wind speeds for all events exceeded the 8 m s(-1) minimum threshold associated with SIULs in Japanese winter lightning storms. Radar reflectivities at the event locations had a mean of 28 dBZ and were almost always <35 dBZ. While conventional radar displays suggested stratiform precipitation in the thundersnow region, detailed analysis of 3-D-gridded NMQ (National Mosaic and Multi-Sensor Quantitative Precipitation Estimation) radar reflectivity data confirmed elevated embedded cellular convection spanning the -10 degrees C region associated with isentropic lifting above a frontal surface, evidence of noninductive charge generation sufficient to allow upward leader initiation from tall objects.

However, due to intensified river regulation and more frequent extreme climatic events such as drought, observational evidence suggests that the synchrony of geese migration and Carex phenology could not be maintained without human interventions, imposing a great risk of food shortage during the wintering period. Consequently, the current conservation priority in this Ramsar site is shifted to wet meadow improvement to ensure optimal food quality. Understanding the food preferences of wintering geese is the key for effective wet meadow management. As the growth stage and nutrient level of food plants are the decisive factors influencing the diet selection of herbivores, in this study, we sampled the preferred food items by tracking the foraging paths of the Greater White-fronted Goose (n = 84) and Bean Goose (n = 34) to quantify the "foraging window" in terms of plant height,protein level, and energy content. Further, we established relationships between the above three variables of Carex based on in-situ measurements. The results show that the geese prefer plants with height ranging from 2.4 to 25.0 cm, with protein content from 13.9 to 25.2 %, and energy content from 1440.0 to 1813.6 KJ/100 g. While plant energy content increases with height, the height-protein level relationship is negative. The opposite growth curves signify a conservation challenge to maintain the delicate balance between the quantity and quality requirements of wintering geese. Carex meadow management, such as mowing, should focus on optimizing the timing of action to maximize energy supply while maintaining the right protein level for the long-term fitness, reproduction and survival of the birds.

Periods of droughts which are supposed to be induced by climate change as well as acidic pulses modify the chemical composition of lake water. Snow melt and heavy rains cause flash floods in lake inflows which are controlled by subsurface-flow. One of the inflows exhibits extremely low pH values [pH(min) = 3.66], high concentrations for aluminium [Al(max) = 1.10 Mg l-1], dissolved organic carbon [DOC(max) = 30.7 mg l-1], and sulfate [SO4max = 9.08 Mg l-1]. Organic and inorganic acids are both likely to contribute to the acidity of these surface waters. During baseflow conditions, groundwater springs still show slightly positive alkalinity values as well as increased pH values up to about 6.0. Since 1985 lake surface samples demonstrate an increasing tendency towards pH values higher than 5.0 during dry summer periods. Positive alkalinity values occur in the hypolimnion during anoxic conditions.

Mean January temperature (Tan), annual precipitation (Pane), winter (PO and summer (Ps) precipitation, and a seasonal index (SI) have all been quantified from a fossil pollen record. Several bio- and geo-chemical elements have also been analysed to evaluate the links between past climate, landscape, and ecosystem changes. Over the last 6000 years, climate has changed within a low temperature and precipitation range with a trend of aridity and warming towards the present. Tian has varied within a ca. 2 degrees C range, and P-ann within less than 100 mm yr(-1). The long-term changes reconstructed in our record between 6 ka cal BP and today are consistent with the aridity trend observed in the Mediterranean basin. Despite the overall limited range of climate fluctuation, we observe major changes in the ecosystem composition, the carbon isotopic contents of organic matter (delta C-13), the total organic carbon and nitrogen amount, and the carbon to nitrogen ratio (C / N) after ca. 3750 cal BP. The main ecosystem changes correspond to a noticeable transition in the conifer forest between the Atlas cedar, which expanded after 3750 cal BP, and the pine forest. These vegetation changes impacted the sedimentation type and its composition in the lake. Between 5500 and 5000 cal BP, we observe an abrupt change in all proxies which is coherent with a decrease in Tian without a significant change in the overall amount of precipitation.					; Carre, Matthieu/G-6324-2012; Cheddadi, Rachid/GXM-6391-2022	NOUR EL BAIT, Majda/0000-0003-3677-8351; Carre, Matthieu/0000-0001-8178-7316; Eynaud, Frederique/0000-0003-1283-7425; Martinez, Philippe/0000-0002-9825-2032; Rhoujjati, Ali/0000-0002-8176-7451; 													1814-9324	1814-9332					2016	12	4					1029	1042		10.5194/cp-12-1029-2016	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-1029-2016													WOS:000376073100013

The Seasonality of In-Stream Nutrient Concentrations and Uptake in Arctic Headwater Streams in the Northern Foothills of Alaska's Brooks Range	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Over the past 30 plus years, the Arctic has warmed at a rate of 0.6 degrees C per decade. This has resulted in considerable permafrost thaw and alterations of hydrological and biogeochemical processes. Coincident with these changes, recent studies document increases in annual fluxes of inorganic nutrients in larger Arctic rivers. Changing nutrient fluxes in Arctic rivers have been largely attributed to warming-induced active layer expansion and newly exposed subsurface source areas. However, the ability of Arctic headwater streams to modulate inorganic nutrient patterns manifested in larger rivers remains unresolved. We evaluated environmental conditions, stream ecosystem metabolism, and nutrient uptake in three headwater streams of the Alaskan Arctic to quantify patterns of retention of inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P). We observed elevated ambient nitrate-N (NO3-N) concentrations in late summer/early fall in two of three experimental stream reaches. We observed detectable increases in uptake as a result of nutrient addition in 88% of PO4-P additions (n = 25), 38% of NH4-N additions (n = 24), and 24% of NO3-N additions (n = 25). We observed statistically significant relationships between NH4-N uptake and ecosystem respiration, and PO4-P uptake and gross primary productivity. Although these headwater streams demonstrate ability to control downstream transport of PO4-P, we observed little evidence the same holds for dissolved inorganic N. Consequently, our results suggest that continued increases in terrestrial to aquatic N transfer in Arctic headwater landscapes are likely to be evident in larger Arctic rivers, in-network lakes, and coastal environments.					; Gooseff, Michael/N-6087-2015; Wollheim, Wilfred/AAA-3516-2022	Wollheim, Wilfred/0000-0002-5009-3212; Wlostowski, Adam/0000-0001-5703-9916; Gooseff, Michael/0000-0003-4322-8315; Covino, Tim/0000-0001-7218-4927													2169-8953	2169-8961				APR	2021	126	4							e2020JG005949	10.1029/2020JG005949	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JG005949													WOS:000645001600021

Starting in the 1970s, these processes resulted in the formation of an oxygen-depleted hypolimnion during summer-autumn stratification of the lake. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that eutrophication of the lake leads not only to the full depletion of oxygen and nitrate in the hypolimnion but as well to the presence of sulfate-reducing microorganisms and toxic hydrogen sulfide. Concentrations of hydrogen sulfide in the hypolimnion of Major and Minor Sevan in October were as high as 9 and 39 mu M, respectively. In October 2019, 66 % of lake's bottom was covered by sulfidic waters, while the fraction of sulfidic water volume reached 19 %. Values of delta S-34 for hypolimnetic sulfide are lower by only 7-12 parts per thousand compared to epilimnetic sulfate, while delta S-33 values of sulfide are similar to the delta S-33 values of sulfate. These isotopic fingerprints are not consistent with microbial sulfate reduction as the sole source of hydrogen sulfide in the hypolimnion. We attribute the formation of a sulfidic deep-water layer to a combination of microbial sulfate reduction in the water column and diffusion of hydrogen sulfide from the sediments.

J	Robinson, JA; Oring, LW				Robinson, JA; Oring, LW			Long-distance movements by American Avocets and Black-necked Stilts	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Color-banded American Avocets (Recurvirostra americana) and Black-necked Stilts (Himantopus mexicanus) were resighted >50 km from their banding locations in the Great Basin. Records from 90 migration and winter resightings of birds banded in the Honey Lake Valley (northeastern California) and 3 birds banded at Great Salt Lake (Utah) provided unique data on long-distance movements by individuals of these species. Avocets and stilts left Honey Lake breeding areas and went to stopover areas at Mono Lake and in the Tulare Basin as early as July. Some individuals spent 48 days or more in the Tulare Basin. Both avocets and stilts were observed in sibling groups during migration. Although one pair of banded stilts was observed during migration, differences in sex ratio at a migration stopover site suggested that male and female stilts might have different wintering ranges or migration behavior. Avocets from Honey Lake were found wintering along the California coast from Arcata southward and along the west coast of Sinaloa, Mexico. First-year avocets were more often seen in coastal areas of California (relative to inland areas) than were adults. Stilts were found wintering in central California. Avocets and stilts banded in Utah were seen in the Tulare Basin (one stilt) and at wintering grounds in Mexico (one avocet and one stilt), indicating the potential for population mixing. We propose that avocets migrate in short hops, retain partial family group associations during migration, and may have age-specific differences in migratory behavior or wintering range. We propose that stilts retain partial family group associations during migration, maintain pair bonds beyond the breeding attempt, and have sexual differences in migratory behavior or wintering range. These results have important ramifications for understanding impacts of drainwater evaporation ponds in the Tulare Basin on nonbreeding avocets and stilts.

J	Linton, TK; Reid, SD; Wood, CM				Linton, TK; Reid, SD; Wood, CM			The metabolic costs and physiological consequences to juvenile rainbow trout of a simulated summer warming scenario in the presence and absence of sublethal ammonia	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Quantitative bioenergetic and physiological measurements were made on juvenile rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss exposed over summer (June-September 1993) to a simulated summer warming scenario of +2 degrees C in the presence and absence of 70 mu mol total ammonia/L (nominal; equivalent to 0.013 mg NH3-N/L at 15 degrees C, pH = 7.6) to determine the metabolic costs and physiological consequences associated with their growth in a warmer, more polluted environment. With unlimited food, fish exposed to +2 degrees C show better energy conversion efficiency and increased nitrogen retention at a metabolic cost equivalent to the base temperature group. Metabolic fuel use appears to have been optimized to support the bioenergetic demands imposed during maximum summer water temperatures. Low-level ammonia enhances nitrogen and energy conversion efficiency by stimulating protein retention, which ultimately results in the most cost-effective growth. However, in the +2 degrees C ammonia treatment, the stimulatory effect of low-level ammonia is lost during mid to late summer due to the greater energy demands when fish are forced to cope with the additional stress of a small further increase in temperature.

The drawdown was 2 in during the first winter and 3 in during the next two winters. Lake whitefish abundance decreased by more than 80% during the three years of drawdown, due to recruitment failures and decreased annual survival, Annual Survival was much lower during the first year of drawdown than the succeeding two years. Survival was particularly low during the first winter of drawdown, possibly caused by anoxic conditions under ice after the drawdown was completed. Lake whitefish condition increased during drawdown, but the increase was not as great as we expected if it were entirely a density-dependent response. Recruitment of Lake 226 lake whitefish resumed after the final year of drawdown and condition decreased. The changes documented in Lake 226 during drawdown did not occur for this population during the 10 years prior to drawdown or for the take whitefish population in the Lake 468 that was monitored during the entire 14 year study period.																			0071-1128		3-510-47059-1				2002	57						209	219																WOS:000180355400018
J	Johansson, M; Saarni, S; Sorvari, J				Johansson, Markus; Saarni, Saija; Sorvari, Jouni			Ultra-High-Resolution Monitoring of the Catchment Response to Changing Weather Conditions Using Online Sediment Trapping	QUATERNARY												The purpose of this study was to identify relationships between meteorological and hydrological observations and sediment flux rate changes, in order to better understand catchment dynamics. The meteorological and hydrological observations included local air temperature, wind speed, water temperature, and ice cover, while the sediment flux rate was observed in the lake basin using a modified sediment trap technique. This study demonstrates the advantages of a new online methodology applied in conventional sediment trapping to obtain flux rate information with daily resolution. A prototype of a high-resolution online sediment trap was tested in Savilahti Bay, Lake Kallavesi, eastern Finland, during the period from 22 October 2017 to 6 October 2018. The daily resolutions of meteorological, hydrological, and sediment flux rate data were analyzed using statistical methods. The results indicate relationships between temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and sediment flux rate, but the urban site also showed erosional changes due to anthropogenic land use. Sediment flux ceased during winter season and spring floods were recorded as pronounced peaks in sediment flux, while the growing season showed generally higher sediment accumulation rates. This research also provides valuable information on the catchment response to short-term weather events. The influence of a storm led to larger sediment flux for several days. The importance of wind speed and frost formation on sedimentation, which has been difficult to address due to trap deployment times of typically several months, is now supported. Used together with varved sediment archives, online sediment trapping will facilitate the interpretation of paleoclimatic proxy records and modeling of detailed weather and erosion conditions that are related to climate change.

A paucity of infrastructure and capacity has historically limited efforts to address water resource vulnerability for Arctic communities; therefore, we developed a locally relevant framework that quantifies liquid water volume under varying climate and demand scenarios. We incorporated vulnerability grading standards based on existing indices to assess the viability of single-source water reservoirs. Using municipal demand and meteorological data from the Arctic Canadian hamlets of Igloolik and Sanirajak, Nunavut, we forecasted end-of-winter reservoir volumes for 2022-2035 under a number of scenarios; baseline supply was assessed in relation to system capacity for summer recharge, anomalous seasonal events, and deviations in available ice-free days for recharge. Our assessment indicated that the respective reservoirs were highly responsive to air temperature and ice thickness. Cases of complete reservoir depletion (<= 0 % available liquid water) were prevalent across simulated years, whereas normal reservoir conditions (30 similar to 60 % available liquid reservoir water) were comparatively limited. We found that neither community had sufficient capacity within their current infrastructure for supplying freshwater over a typical planning horizon. Our analysis highlights the need for locally-specific planning related to freshwater supply to ensure sustainable capacity under a variable climate future. Together, our framework and models are an effective tool for assessing water resource vulnerability that can be linked to existing water resource indices to inform municipal planning and mitigation strategies.

J	LaBuhn, S; Klump, JV				LaBuhn, Shelby; Klump, J. Val			Estimating summertime epilimnetic primary production via in situ monitoring in an eutrophic freshwater embayment, Green Bay, Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Quantifying rates of primary production and respiration is fundamental to understanding ecosystem function. This study utilized high-frequency time series, buoy-based sensor data to estimate daily primary production and respiration rates during the summers of 2012-2015 in southern Green Bay, Lake Michigan. Highly coherent diel oscillations of dissolved oxygen concentrations in epilimnetic waters were commonly observed for much of the summer via 30-min time intervals from the GLOS buoy (NOAA 45014) sensor array. Corrections for air-sea exchange based upon wind speed-derived gas exchange coefficients and saturation state, when combined with mixing depth, allow calculation of daytime net oxygen production and nighttime respiration. Thermistor string observations at 1-m intervals over the 13 m water depth showed the onset of thermal stratification, development of the thennocline, and occasional mixing events. For the summers of 2014 and 2015, during which a nearly continuous sensor record exists, gross primary production (GPP) and respiration (R) were estimated to be 342 +/- 117 and 318 +/- 83 mmol O-2 m(-2) day(-1) for GPP and -325 +/- 120 and -306 +/- 66 mmol O-2 m(-2) day(-1) for R, respectively. These results indicate that during most of the summer, southern Green Bay tends towards net autotrophy with production on average exceeding respiration by 9 +/- 6% (SD). Cumulative net ecosystem production from June through September was estimated to be 3.2 and 13 mol C m(-2) in 2014 (118 days) and 2015 (113 days), respectively, and is sufficient to drive a significant portion of benthic respiration, the principal cause of seasonal bottom water hypoxia.

Mechanisms affecting biomass and distribution of charophytes and Najas marina in Myall lake, New South Wales, Australia	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Two years of measurements are explored with a view to formulating an ecosystem model for Myall Lake. Stable physical characteristics, low catchment loads, low light attenuation, flat-bottomed hypsometry, and soft gyttja substrate allow stable charophyte biomass throughout the year in Myall Lake. Chara fibrosa dominates the total biomass and is abundant over the depth range 0.5-4 m. Nitella hyalina is found over the same depth range but has diminished biomass at depths greater than 2 m due to increased incidence of zero-biomass samples at depths greater than 1.5 m. Upper bounds for biomass densities were estimated for charophytes. Najas marina has great seasonal variability and meadows can have very high biomass in waters 1.5-2.7 m deep. High biomass of Najas marina is associated with low biomass of Nitella hyalina and may be a factor determining how the biomass of Nitella hyalina is distributed with respect to depth. Patchiness of Najas marina is particularly high. Temperature and light can support two growing seasons for Najas marina but mechanical disturbance is often high in spring and high biomass was only observed in late autumn during the present study. Less than 5% of the present-day production of submerged macrophytes would have been required to produce organic material of the gyttja over a 1,000-year period. The spatial distributions of gyttja and the dominant macrophytes are consistent with wind patterns. Down-lake limits on the distributions of charophytes and Najas marina are related to a gradient in the coefficient of light attenuation that is, in turn, related to proximity to the bulk of the catchment load.					; RAJAPAKSE, R.

Its high flexibility in the uses of light and macronutrients (C, N, P) frustrates any bloom prediction and control based on macronutrients regulation. To identify the critical factors promoting periodic blooms of R. raciborskii, the trends of meteorological, hydrodynamic, physical, and chemical variables (including macro- and micronutrients: N, P, Fe) were analyzed in a Chinese tropical large reservoir (Dashahe reservoir) over five years. It was hypothesized that Fe availability, mediated by the mixing pattern of the reservoir, played a crucial role in the periodic blooms of the cyanobacterium. To have a more complete understanding, the effects of Fe on growth of a local R. raciborskii strain were tested in a monoculture experiment. The biomass and relative abundance of R. raciborskii in the reservoir showed a clear seasonal trend, with relative abundance > 50% in summer/autumn (July to October). Three habitat types along a dominance gradient were identified in the reservoir and 17 variables were used to compare them. Statistical analysis and habitat comparison showed that temperature and stratification, dissolved Fe and N concentrations in the epilimnion, and dissolved Fe and oxygen concentrations in the hypolimnion were the critical factors driving the dynamics of R. raciborskii in the study reservoir. The habitat dominated by R. raciborskii was characterized by a relatively low availability of macro resources (Zeu/Zm < 1, SRP < 0.01 mg/L, DIN < 0.3 mg/L) and by a high Fe availability supplemented from hypoxic hypolimnion. The dependence of growth on Fe concentration increase was confirmed in culture where the maximum was reached at 0.689 mg Fe /L. Our results suggest that a high Fe bioavailability, also originating from the hypoxic hypolimnion, influences the dynamics R. raciborskii and favors the blooms of the species. As a consequence, Fe concentrations in the water column as well as oxygen measurements along the water column should be routinely included in the monitoring programs aimed at predicting and controlling R. raciborskii blooms.

Environmental parameters such as pH, conductivity, inorganic nutrients, total suspended solids and chlorophyll a were determined in order to characterize the trophic status of the studied water bodies. We found water bodies with oligotrophic to hypereutrophic characteristics. Organisms belonging to the Bacteroidetes and Alphaproteobacteria were found at the highest pH environment. Bacteroidetes were also related to high nutrient concentrations. Verrucomicrobia were associated with the most oligotrophic reservoir and low pH values. Actinobacteria were present in all samples from lakes and reservoirs, indicating its preference for lentic water bodies. Cyanobacteria dominance was related to high pH and conductivity levels. In general the conductivity values recorded in winter 2005 were the highest over recent years and chlorophyll a also reached very high levels. The data emphasize an enhanced risk of eutrophication for the studied water bodies, especially in the subsequent months when the temperature rises.					; de Figueiredo, Daniela/C-6192-2008; Fonseca, Fatima/C-9786-2009; Henriques, Isabel/B-1667-2008; Moura, Alexandra/C-8555-2009; Fonseca, Fátima/C-9786-2009; Correia, Antonio/B-1593-2008	Pereira, Mario J./0000-0003-1826-391X; de Figueiredo, Daniela/0000-0003-3760-4142; Fonseca, Fatima/0000-0001-7979-5907; Correia, Antonio/0000-0002-5115-1429; Moura, Alexandra/0000-0003-0339-1230; Henriques, Isabel/0000-0001-7717-4939; 													0168-6496	1574-6941				MAR	2007	59	3					638	650		10.1111/j.1574-6941.2006.00241.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2006.00241.x								17381519					WOS:000244719400010
J	MCCARTNEY, AP; SAVELLE, JM				MCCARTNEY, AP; SAVELLE, JM			THULE ESKIMO WHALING IN THE CENTRAL CANADIAN ARCTIC	ARCTIC ANTHROPOLOGY												Recent interpretations of prehistoric Thule Eskimo culture of the Canadian Arctic emphasize whaling as well as nonwhaling subsistence patterns, depending upon location and period. Mathiassen was the first archaeologist to contrast to the whaling pattern with the non-whaling pattern of caribou/seal hunting and fishing. The Somerset Island-Boothia Peninsula-King William Island area, at the center of the Canadian Archipelago, is an excellent locale for studying these two major adaptations because whaling sites facing open summer waters are found near nonwhaling sites facing ice-choked channels. Whale bones occur in abundance at Thule winter sites between Creswell Bay and Bellot Strait on Somerset Island; much of the beach there is postulated to have been used by Thule Eskimos as a whaling beach. Booth Peninsula and King William Island sites, by comparison, have very few whale bones, but are situated near caribou crossings and/or sealing localities and rivers and lakes rich in fish. By contrasting these two dominant subsistence-settlement systems, the variability of the Thule archaeological records may be clarified in regard to local and regional ecological adjustments. Methodologically, we note that combined aerial and foot surveys have proved to be important in locating sites and associated subsistence activity areas such as whaling beaches.																			0066-6939	1933-8139					1985	22	2					37	58																WOS:A1985E060600005

Average rates of net increase in early spring (i.e. up until the end of March) are best correlated with the logarithm of surface irradiance (r2 = 0.71-0.87). Average spring growth rates in late February and March (weeks 6-13 of the year) defined by this analysis significantly exceed rates predicted from calculations of integrated production with existing physiological data for A. formosa but are similar to the predicted growth rates at the mean irradiance in the mixed layer. In late spring (April-May), stratification becomes well established and the rate of population increase lessens. This decrease occurs before dissolved silicate is depleted to growth-limiting concentrations during increasing average irradiance in the surface layer. Near exhaustion of dissolved silicate and rapid loss of A. formosa from the surface layer follow. P limitation, enhanced sedimentation, and photoinhibition are factors that may slow net diatom accumulation before the onset of silicate limitation.

In this study we quantified the flux of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) over 3 years from 12 small subarctic lakes. The lakes accumulated consistent and high amounts of CO2 and CH4 (56-97% as CO2) over the winter, resulting in a high flux during ice thaw. The CO2 flux during ice thaw increased with increasing mean depth of the lakes, while the CH4 flux was high in lakes surrounded by mires. The ice thaw period was quantitatively important to the annual gas balances of the lakes. For nine of the lakes, 11 to 55% of the annual flux occurred during thaw. For three of the lakes with an apparent net annual CO2 uptake, including the thaw period reversed the balance from sink to source. Our results suggest that the ice thaw period is critically important for the emissions of CO2 and CH4 in small lakes.

The evolution of catches of passive fishing gears reveal movements of eels. A daily logbook system had been settled in relation with professional fishery of the lake of Grand-Lieu (Loire-Atlantique). It allows to collect accurate catch data. This paper presents an analysis of daily fluctuations of catch per unit effort (CPUE) of European eel during two years (1991 and 1992). Two elements are result of this study. First, the time serie of CPUE follows an annual trend which leads from low spring values to highest summer and autumnal values. But into this annual trend, shortless variations exist. Second, research of cyclic occurrence by the FOURIER transform analysis has produced only imprecise results. But a lowpass filter, on the other hand, confirms the hypothesis of the presence of a 28 days frequency. This periodicity perfectly corresponds to lunar cycle. Finally, it is proposed to improve the study with a CPUE and meteorological datas relations analysis.																			0767-2861						1994		335					123	132		10.1051/kmae:1994009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae:1994009													WOS:A1994RK56600010

Climate change between the mid and late Holocene in northern high latitudes - Part 1: Survey of temperature and precipitation proxy data	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												We undertake a study in two parts, where the overall aim is to quantitatively compare results from climate proxy data with results from several climate model simulations from the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project for the mid-Holocene period and the pre-industrial, conditions for the pan-arctic region, north of 60 degrees N. In this first paper, we survey the available published local temperature and precipitation proxy records. We also discuss and quantifiy some uncertainties in the estimated difference in climate between the two periods as recorded in the available data. The spatial distribution of available published local proxies has a marked geographical bias towards land areas surrounding the North Atlantic sector, especially Fennoscandia. The majority of the reconstructions are terrestrial, and there is a large over-representation towards summer temperature records. The available reconstructions indicate that the northern high latitudes were warmer in both summer, winter and the in annual mean temperature at the mid-Holocene (6000 BP +/- 500 yrs) compared to the pre-industrial period (1500 AD +/- 500 yrs). For usage in the model-data comparisons (in Part 1), we estimate the calibration uncertainty and also the internal variability in the proxy records, to derive a combined minimum uncertainty in the reconstructed temperature change between the two periods. Often, the calibration uncertainty alone, at a certain site, exceeds the actual reconstructed climate change at the site level. In high-density regions, however, neighbouring records can be merged into a composite record to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The challenge of producing reliable inferred climate reconstructions for the Holocene cannot be underestimated, considering the fact that the estimated temperature and precipitation fluctuations during this period are in magnitude similar to, or lower than, the uncertainties the reconstructions. We advocate a more widespread practice of archiving proxy records as most of the potentially available reconstructions are not published in digital form.					; Zhang, Qiong/J-7334-2019	Kornich, Heiner/0000-0003-0524-6440; Moberg, Anders/0000-0002-5177-9347; Nilsson, Johan/0000-0002-9591-124X													1814-9324	1814-9332					2010	6	5					591	608		10.5194/cp-6-591-2010	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-6-591-2010													WOS:000283667900004

To enable long-term Chl-a monitoring using Landsat series sensors, development of a Chl-a estimation algorithm for the new Landsat sensor is requisite. This study aims to identify the most accurate algorithm for Chl-a estimation in hypertrophic waters using Landsat 8 images and in situ Chl-a data from West Lake and nine other hypertrophic lakes in Hanoi (Vietnam's capital). The best estimation was obtained by the ratio of two reflectances at 562 and 483 nm, corresponding to the ratio of the OLI band 3 versus band 2, termed the GrB(2) algorithm. The GrB2 values using the reflectances of water samples and the Landsat images were correlated with the Chl-a by an exponential function (r(2) = 0.64 to 0.82), and the estimated Chl-a were verified by the smallness of standard error (smaller than 10%) and degree of conformity with recent fish-kill phenomena that commonly occur in those lakes in summer and early spring. Because the availability of GrB2 is limited to waters with low levels of inorganic suspended matter, its extension to waters with much higher levels requires further investigation.					; Katsuaki, Koike/AAF-6438-2020	Koike, Katsuaki/0000-0003-2195-1369; Mai, Trong Nhuan/0009-0000-3098-6761; Nguyen, Ha/0000-0002-5010-5615; 													1939-1404	2151-1535				NOV	2017	10	11			SI		4919	4929		10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2739184	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2739184													WOS:000415719000021

Changing phosphorus concentration and subsequent prophage induction alter composition of a freshwater viral assemblage	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. The effects of nutrients on the temporal variation in viral assemblage composition, and in particular the occurrence of temperate phages, were assessed in mesotrophic Lake Erken over 5 months of the ice-free period. The percentage of the bacterial community that contained inducible prophages (lysogenic bacteria, LB) changed over the season, being lowest in late spring and highest in early autumn. The most important variables for predicting LB were concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and temperature. 2. The viral assemblage composition, as determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), also changed over the season. Prophages were induced by incubations with mitomycin C and we show, for the first time for natural communities, that the resulting temperate phages could be detected using PFGE. 3. A substantial fraction (19%) of the number of detected operational taxonomic units (OTUs: defined as unique genome sizes) appeared unique to temperate phages and 41% of OTUs increased in relative abundance after treatment with mitomycin C. 4. Different viral OTUs were induced at different times during the season. The most important environmental factor covarying with viral assemblage composition over the period of study, as determined by multivariate analysis, was concentration of TP. In re-growth cultures with natural bacteria and lowered viral abundance (VA) (decreased virus to bacteria ratio), addition of PO(4)-P induced prophages and resulted in subsequent production of temperate phages, as indicated by a decreased percentage of LB and increased VA. Incubations of natural bacterial communities with mitomycin C (field data) or PO(4)-P (experiment) changed the viral assemblage composition at a similar rate as the observed monthly changes in the lake.

However, only P. australiensis can be accepted. It occurs in Australia in a broad south-eastern arc, and in a wide variety of permanent inland waters (coastal streams, rivers, lakes, farm dams and ponds). In these it favors vegetated areas. Young hatch as free-floating larvae and hatching occurs mainly in early summer in southern Victoria. Females breed in their 2nd summer. In southeastern Australia, at least, this breeding season appears adapted to the hydrological regime of running waters.																			0067-1940						1977	28	4					403	415		10.1071/MF9770403	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF9770403													WOS:A1977EA77800001

CROWN ROT	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Decline in stand density and productivity of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) over time in Canada and the USA has been attributed, in part, to crown and root diseases. In 1985, an experiment was initiated at three locations in Saskatchewan to examine the interaction of (i) harvest frequency, (ii) alfalfa cultivar, (iii) inoculation with fungal crown rot pathogens (Coprinus psychromorbidus, Phoma sclerotioides, or Fusarium spp.), and (iv) K nutrition on the etiology, lesion initiation, incidence, and severity of crown rot of alfalfa. Plant samples were collected from the plots in early spring and late fall each year, starting 1 yr after seeding. The pattern of symptom initiation and lesion expansion were similar at all sites. Lesions were observed initially at the base of senescing stems, and spread laterally into the crown and vertically into the tap root. Lesions were observed on plants at all sites on the first sampling date (> 70% of plants affected at Loon Lake and Saskatoon and 32% at Melfort), but severity was low. By the fall of the following year (1987), incidence was near 100% at all sites, and severity had increased markedly. Harvest frequency and K fertility did not affect crown rot at any location. Inoculation with C. psychromorbidus resulted in small increases in crown rot severity at two sites, but inoculation with the other pathogens had no effect. 'Nordica' alfalfa was more resistant to crown rot than 'Beaver. These results indicate that resistance to crown rot may be advantageous if long-term persistence is required, but resistance is not required in short-term rotations. Also, crown rot and crown bud rot, two alfalfa diseases that have previously been described as distinct entities, appear to be a single disease complex, based on similarities in symptom development and the organisms associated with affected plants.

J	Li, JL; Yu, X				Li, Jiale; Yu, Xiong (Bill)			Onshore and offshore wind energy potential assessment near Lake Erie shoreline: A spatial and temporal analysis	ENERGY												Choosing a proper location is a pivotal initial step in building a wind farm. As appropriate locations for onshore wind farms become more and more scarce, offshore wind farms have drawn significant attention. The coastal line of the Great Lakes is an area that has great wind energy potential. This research conducted detailed statistical analysis of the onshore, nearshore, and offshore wind energy potential of Lake Erie near Cleveland, Ohio. It analyzed the wind data collected in 10-min time intervals from three locations near the Lake Erie shoreline to assess wind characteristics. Statistical analyses of wind data include the Weibull shape and scale factors, turbulence intensity, and wind power density. In addition, the capacity factor and the potential energy output are estimated by using two commercial wind turbines, which are appropriate for the sites at 50 m and 80 m hub heights. The results show that offshore sites will produce at least 1.7 times more energy than the onshore and nearshore sites when using the same commercial wind turbine. Furthermore, offshore wind turbines could produce more power during peak hours in the spring and winter. This indicates that offshore wind turbines offer advantages over onshore wind turbines in Lake Erie. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

As a result, the biotic assemblages that thrive in such environments are a diverse mix of species, with wide ranges of tolerances. While annual succession and vertical distribution of phytoplankton assemblages in marine and freshwater ecosystems are well documented, few data are available which describe the spatial and temporal variability of phytoplankton in coastal lagoons, even though these are a protected habitat under the European Union's Habitat Directive. In this study, high frequency monitoring (HFM) of chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) using a vertical profiling sonde was used to describe the variation in algal biomass over six annual cycles and through the water column of Lough Furnace, a perennially stratified coastal lagoon on the west coast of Ireland. Spot sampling, and species enumeration of phytoplankton were used to confirm the patterns observed in the fluorescence data, which indicated a general pattern of increasing biomass starting in spring, and a deepening of the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) over the summer. Typical of a stratified system, the DCM was often situated below the surface mixed layer, in saline hypoxic water. The best predictors of daily maximum ChlF were the depth of the surface mixed layer and daily solar radiation. We conclude that HFM allows an unprecedented glimpse into the substantial variability and complexity of phytoplankton distributions, a key biotic variable.					; Jennings, Eleanor/ISU-1018-2023; Archer, Lorraine/P-7604-2019; Obrador, Biel/A-1856-2009	Lucy, Frances/0000-0002-4785-2724; Obrador, Biel/0000-0003-4050-0491; Archer, Lorraine/0000-0001-8339-1577													0272-7714	1096-0015				MAR 5	2019	218						278	291		10.1016/j.ecss.2018.12.010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2018.12.010													WOS:000459519700027
J	Richardson, TL; Gibson, CE; Heaney, SI				Richardson, TL; Gibson, CE; Heaney, SI			Temperature, growth and seasonal succession of phytoplankton in Lake Baikal, Siberia	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Growth rates of two dominant Lake Baikal phytoplankton, the winter diatom Aulacoseira baicalensis and the summer cyanobacterium Synechocystis limnetica, were measured in the laboratory under varied temperature and light regimes to determine the potential role of these abiotic factors in seasonal species succession in the lake. 2. Aulacoseira baicalensis grew best at low temperature and not at all above 8 degrees C. Its maximum instantaneous growth rate was 0.15 d(-1) recorded at 2-3 degrees C. Cells grew faster as temperature decreased, apparently in contrast to conventional Q(10)-based temperature-growth relationships. 3. The picoplankter Synechocystis limnetica did not grow at 2-3 or 5-6 degrees C, but grew at a rate of 0.24 d(-1) at the highest incubation temperature of 17 degrees C. Maximum growth rate was 0.35 d(-1) at 8 degrees C. 4. Saturation irradiances (I-k) for growth of Aulacoseira baicalensis and Synechocystis limnetica were near pre-acclimation values of 40 mu mol m(-2) S-1. At temperatures conducive to growth, both phytoplankters grew at all irradiances tested, except for A. baicalensis which would not grow at values above 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at 8 degrees C. 5. We conclude that temperature is a major driving force for the seasonal succession of species in Lake Baikal. Other factors, including vertical mixing of the water column and grazing by zooplankton, may also play important roles.

J	YOUNG, JO; SPELLING, SM				YOUNG, JO; SPELLING, SM			FOOD UTILIZATION AND NICHE OVERLAP IN 3 SPECIES OF LAKE-DWELLING LEECHES (HIRUDINEA)	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The diets of Erpobdella octoculata, Glossiphonia complanata and Helobdella stagnalis on the stony littoral zone of eutrophic Crose Mere were examined over two years using the precipitin test. The abundances of food organisms were measured. For all leech species, juvenile mortality was greatest in locations where a low ratio of prey abundance to recruited leech abundance occurred, and the intensity of feeding by Erpobdella and Helobdella fell slightly in late summer when large numbers of juveniles on these species were present; these suggest the involvement of food in juvenile mortality. Seasonal changes in feeding intensity were similar for all leech species, with the exceptions outlined above and for Glossiphonia in April when feeding by brooding adults ceased, at which time the severity of any interspecific competition would have been reduced. Within a leech species, there was little change in the food spectrum as the leeches grew. Niche breadth was lowest for Erpobdella and highest for Helobdella. Niche overlap was greatest between Glossiphonia and Helobdella, and there was a trend for overlap values to be lower between Glossiphonia and Erpobdella than between Helobdella and Erpobdella. Erpobdella fed mainly on chironomids and oligochaetes, Glossiphonia on molluscs, oligochaetes and chironomids, and Helobdella on oligochaetes, chironomids, Asellus, molluscs and amphipods, all in decreasing order of importance. It is suggested that coexistence in the leech species may be due in part to Erpobdella and Glossiphonia having ''food refuges'' in chironomids and molluscs, respectively, with Helobdella being more of a generalist predator.																			0952-8369	1469-7998				OCT	1989	219		2				231	243		10.1111/j.1469-7998.1989.tb02579.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.1989.tb02579.x													WOS:A1989AZ87800005

The purpose of this investigation were to identify the trends in the concentrations of PM10 in urban stations of Tabriz, Iran. One of the main problems of Tabriz results from the drying of Urmia Lake and the release of suspended particles from the lake to the urban area. There has been accelerated drying to Urmia Lake over the past decades as well as changes in the local area winds depending on season. Because of the changing PM10 concentrations, it will be useful to map the changes across the study area using geographical information system (GIS) methods. GIS was used to estimate the variations in exposure to PM10 for people living across Tabriz. In addition, health risk assessments (total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, respiratory mortality, hospital admissions cardiovascular disease, hospital admissions respiratory disease) were conducted as a function of time. Although a Mann-Kendall trend test found that PM10 concentration had decreased during the study period, there is a change in the nature of the particles when the wind direction was from the lake to the Tabriz city. Particularly during the spring and winter, the air pollution caused by PM10 becomes problematic given the effects of the hazardous particulate matter blowing from the lake to the neighboring cities, and more attention paid to the PM10. The results show that the health effects related to PM10 varied with the concentration. Therefore, the development of management strategies to reduce PM10 caused by the drying of lake Urmia and urban traffic, especially in the central area of the city, is essential for PM10 control and improved public health.

Field and Laboratory Evaluation of Dam Escapement of Muskellunge	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Muskellunge Esox masquinongy occur in many Midwestern reservoirs where dam escapement is often reported. Because densities of Muskellunge in many reservoirs are low, escapement is a concern. Little is known regarding the factors that influence rates of Muskellunge dam escapement or the proportion of reservoir populations that escape annually. We used controlled laboratory experiments to examine how juvenile Muskellunge interact with flow over a barrier at varying levels of turbidity, flow rate, habitat availability, and periods in the diel cycle. In the field we inserted PIT tags into juvenile and adult Muskellunge, monitored their escapement over a dam with an antenna array, and then compared escapement among demographic groups and described escapement in relation to precipitation events, water temperature, and water clarity. Both laboratory and field studies found Muskellunge were more likely to escape during the day than at night. We estimated that 25% of a reservoir Muskellunge population escaped within the 1-year period of this study, with escapement occurring during late spring but not during fall. Adults were more likely to escape than juveniles, and both sexes escaped at equal rates. Methods developed here can be used to provide useful information to managers and develop mitigation practices to limit escapement in situations where it is not desirable.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG 1	2013	33	4					829	838		10.1080/02755947.2013.812585	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2013.812585													WOS:000323145400019

In situ characterization of exposure in amphibian habitats	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation has been hypothesized as a potential cause of amphibian population declines and increased incidence of malformations. Realistic studies documenting UV irradiance or dose have rarely been conducted in wetlands used by amphibians. Our data indicates that 99% of UVB is attenuated in the top 5-20 cm of wetlands in our study region (northern Minnesota and Wisconsin). Furthermore, vegetation and other habitat features have substantial impacts on local UVB irradiance levels and dose. UVB attenuation in the Water columns of our wetlands is controlled by the specific absorption of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and consequently, UVB attenuation is best predicted by simple laboratory absorbance measurements such 0 bulk,water color. (absorbance at: 440 nm) or wavelength-specific, absorbance coefficients. Seasonal data indicate that the UVB absorption by early and mid-season DOC is higher-than that of late summer and fall DOC, suggesting increased protection from UVB during the potentially sensitive Stages of amphibian development. In addition to dissolved components, our model indicates that suspended solids play a small role in UVB attenuation in our wetlands but apparently only at high concentrations. Models predicting UV attenuation in wetlands should. be used,cautiously and, should consider temporal variability, given the volatility and dynamic nature,of water column characteristics in wetlands. Organism behavior is a critical but poorly understood phenomenon that must be addressed for development of an accurate UV exposure risk model for amphibians.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				JUL 1	2002	36	13					2859	2865		10.1021/es011196l	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es011196l								12144259					WOS:000176591600028

The measurements provide maps that revealed spatial LSWT variability with unprecedented detail. The cold season data did not show significant LSWT heterogeneity and hence no surface cooling spatial variability. However, based on three selected daytime subpixel-scale maps, LSWT patterns showed a variability of >2 degrees C in the spring and >3.5 degrees C in the summer, corresponding to a spatial surface cooling range of >20 and >40 W/m(2), respectively. Due to the nonlinear relationship between turbulent surface heat fluxes and LSWT, negatively skewed LSWT distributions resulted in negatively skewed surface cooling patterns under very stable or predominantly unstable atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) conditions and positively skewed surface cooling patterns under predominantly stable ABL conditions. Implementing a mean spatial filter, the effect of area-averaged LSWT on the surface cooling estimation up to a typical satellite pixel was assessed. The effect of the averaging filter size on the mean spatial surface cooling values was negligible, except for predominantly stable ABL conditions. In that situation, a reduction of similar to 3.5 W/m(2) was obtained when moving from high O(1 m) to low O(1 km) pixel resolution.

Edge analysis was carried out on 754 O.andersonii (54-492mm TL), 601 O.macrochir (83-438mm TL) and 622 C.rendalli (45-379mm TL) caught between August 2010 and August 2011 in Lake Liambezi and the Kavango, Kwando and Upper Zambezi rivers. This was corroborated for O.andersonii (n=17) and C.rendalli (n=16) using a fluorochrome marking experiment conducted in a large earthen pond (625m(2), 1.5m deep) adjacent to the Kavango River. Both methods demonstrated that growth zone deposition occurred annually in juvenile and adult fishes. For edge analysis, the highest proportion of otoliths with an opaque margin was observed in summer from October to December. The fluorochrome marking experiment, however, revealed that opaque zone deposition took place in winter between June and September when water temperatures were lowest (17 degrees C), indicating a lag between opaque zone deposition and detection on the otolith edge.

Variations in the rock magnetic parameters (rlf, rhf, rARM and IRM's at varying field strengths) of sediment samples reflect climate-induced changes in the Chilika Lagoon catchment. The down-core variations in the concentration-dependent magnetic parameters indicate an intensified summer monsoon and enhanced terrigenous input to the lagoon during the Early to Mid-Holocene (-7.8 ka to - 5.5 ka B.P.). In contrast, the Mid- to Late Holocene period witnessed a weaker Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) and less terrigenous input to the lagoon, with an intermediate phase of strengthened monsoon around 2 to 1 ka B.P. Spectral analysis of sedimentary magnetic susceptibility (rlf) data show significant periodicities (at 95 % significance level) of 2523, 573, 147, 93, 59, and 55 years, which are in agreement with the periodicities shown by other paleoclimatic proxies from the region.

J	Laudon, H; Bishop, KH				Laudon, H; Bishop, KH			The rapid and extensive recovery from episodic acidification in northern Sweden due to declines in SO42- deposition -: art. no. 1594	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												[1] Reductions in acid deposition have led to rapid and substantial recovery from episodic acidification associated with spring snow melt in circumpolar waters including 80,000 lakes and 1,000,000 km of watercourses in northern Sweden. Our results are based on the correlation between SO42- concentration in snow and the anthropogenic component of spring flood ANC decline. An empirical model of spring flood response to acid deposition built around that correlation predicts that the 65% reduction in sulphur deposition between 1970 and 1990 has reduced the area of seriously acidified spring floods across 250,000 km(2) of northern Sweden by 75%. The study suggests that much of what has been achieved so far by the large and costly emission reductions in Europe and North America the last decades lies not primarily in chronically acidified regions but rather in more marginally impacted areas where episodic acidification has been the primary chemical impact of SO42- deposition.

A portion of the migratory white-faced ibis (Plegadis chihi) nesting at Carson Lake, Nevada continues to be exposed to dichloro-diphenyldichloro-ethylene (DDE) with no change, which is unusual, observed in egg concentrations between 1985 and 2000. About 45-63% of the earliest nesting segment shows reduced reproductive success correlated with elevated egg concentrations of > 4 mu g/g wet weight (ww). Local prey (primarily earthworms) near nests contained little DDE so we tracked the migration and wintering movements of 20 adult males during 2000-2004 to determine the possible source. At various wintering sites, we found a correlation (r (2) = 0.518, P = 0.0125, N = 11) between DDE in earthworm composites and DDE in blood plasma of white-faced ibis wintering there, although the plasma was collected on their breeding grounds soon after arrival. The main source of DDE was wintering areas in the Mexicali Valley of Baja California Norte, Mexico, and probably the adjacent Imperial Valley, California, USA. This unusual continuing DDE problem for white-faced ibis is associated with: the long-term persistence in soil of DDE; the earthworms' ability to bioconcentrate DDE from soil; the proclivity of white-faced ibis to feed on earthworms in agricultural fields; the species's extreme sensitivity to DDE in their eggs; and perhaps its life history strategy of being a "capital breeder". We suggest surveying and sampling white-faced ibis eggs at nesting colonies, especially at Carson Lake, to monitor the continuing influence of DDE.																			0963-9292	1573-3017				JAN	2010	19	1					153	162		10.1007/s10646-009-0400-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-009-0400-8								19697124					WOS:000273032100015

Within the framework of the ATBIs, the aim of this study was to analyse the diatom flora and ecology of a complex of freshwater ecosystems in the Maritime Alps Natural Park (Italy), designated as a Special area of Conservation under the European Habitat Directive. We sampled epilithic and epiphytic diatoms in different habitats in 24 sites: shallow lake, springs, and streams. Our analysis resulted in a list of 138 diatom taxa, highlighting the great biodiversity and the complex structure of the investigated diatom communities. The taxa list included a wide range of uncommon species, including some recorded for the first time in North-Western Italy. Among the different habitats the highest level of diversity was found in the more lentic waters, in particular in limnocrene springs. These results show that the diatom communities of pristine and undisturbed high-mountain environments are rich and complex, despite the severe environmental conditions.					; Bona, Francesca/B-6404-2013	Bona, Francesca/0000-0003-2260-8001; Ector, Luc/0000-0002-4573-9445													0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT	2012	695	1					233	251		10.1007/s10750-012-1114-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1114-0													WOS:000307310000019
J	Balagizi, CM; Liotta, M				Balagizi, Charles M.; Liotta, Marcello			Key Factors of Precipitation Stable Isotope Fractionation in Central-Eastern Africa and Central Mediterranean	GEOSCIENCES												The processes of isotope fractionation in the hydrological cycle naturally occur during vapor formation, vapor condensation, and moisture transportation. These processes are therefore dependent on local and regional surface and atmospheric physical features such as temperature, pressure, wind speed, and land morphology, and hence on the climate. Because of the strong influence of climate on the isotope fractionation, latitudinal and altitudinal effects on the delta O-18 and delta H-2 values of precipitation at a global scale are observed. In this study, we present and compare the processes governing precipitation isotope fractionation from two contrasting climatic regions: Virunga in Central-Eastern Africa and the Central Mediterranean (Stromboli and Sicily, Italy). While Virunga is a forested rainy tropical region located between Central and Eastern Africa, the Mediterranean region is characterized by a rainy mild winter and a dry hot summer. The reported delta O-18 and delta H-2 dataset are from precipitation collected on rain gauges sampled either on a monthly or an approximately bimonthly basis and published in previous papers. Both regions show clearly defined temporal and altitudinal variations of delta O-18 and delta H-2, depending on precipitation amounts. The Central Mediterranean shows a clear contribution of local vapor forming at the sea-air interface, and Virunga shows a contribution from both local and regional vapor. The vapor of Virunga is from two competing sources: the first is the continental recycled moisture from soil/plant evaporation that dominates during the rainy season, and the second is from the East African Great Lakes evaporation that dominates during the dry season.					; Liotta, Marcello/C-4974-2012	Liotta, Marcello/0000-0002-7203-1565; Balagizi, Charles/0000-0003-0313-2626														2076-3263				AUG	2019	9	8							337	10.3390/geosciences9080337	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences9080337													WOS:000482981000024
J	Arnekleiv, JV; Ronning, L				Arnekleiv, JV; Ronning, L			Migratory patterns and return to the catch site of adult brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) in a regulated river	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												The spawning migration and local homing of adult brown trout was analysed using radio telemetry in a regulated river in central Norway. Twenty-eight large (37-64 cm) brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) were tracked before, during and after spawning in the River Nea, a watercourse with several obstructions, including an outlet tunnel from a power station and a regulated stretch (26 km) with 45 weirs. Two major patterns of spawning migration were found: (1) about half (n = 16; 57%) of the trout moved very little and remained in the deeper pools of the river from June until November; (2) about half (n = 12; 43%) of the trout migrated relatively long distances (12.5-28 km) up the river prior to the spawning period where they stayed in the outlets of small tributaries, or in rapids on the main river during the spawning period. We assume that these trout belong to a population of lake-run migratory trout using the River Nea for spawning. There was no significant difference in body length of migratory and stationary brown trout and no significant difference in total distance moved by migratory males (30.5 km, n = 6) and females (20.5 km, n = 6, p > 0.05). Among migratory trout, we found no correlation between body length and migrated distance. Of the 12 migratory trout, nine undertook fast upward migration in periods of high water flow ( > 100 m(3)/s). They passed the outlet tunnel from the power station and negotiated two to 35 weirs before reaching their main reproduction areas. Three trout crossed several weirs when the discharge was low (10-40 m(3)/s). When there was low discharge, fish remained at the outlet tunnel for up to four weeks and showed a high level of activity. Postspawning downstream migration started between 25 September and 25 October. Most migratory trout (n = 9) wintered in pools on the lower part of the river or in weir basins; only two trout descended to the lake (Selbusjoen) in late autumn.

The results indicate the simplicity and usefulness of the technique and the significantly improved resolution of effluent plume delineation over the customary use of conductance profiles. Concentration patterns of the effluent volatiles suggest counterclockwise circulation of bay water that mixes with inflowing lake water at the eastern reach of the outer bay. The distribution of volatile contaminants is governed by the thermal regime of the receiving waters. During the summer months, the effluent plume wedges between the thermocline and epilimnion, mixing into the surface waters as the distance from the input source increases. In the fall, the colder effluent plume sinks into the hypolimnion and is confined by a bay/lake water-density gradient. In the specific case at hand, the distribution patterns of chloroform and a brominated analog, bromodichloromethane, also suggest the release of chloroform from sediments in the bay.																			0730-7268	1552-8618				JUL	1994	13	7					1065	1074		10.1002/etc.5620130708	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620130708													WOS:A1994NT24100008

Threshold storm approach for locating phosphorus problem areas: An application in three agricultural watersheds in the Canadian Lake Erie basin	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Hot-spots and hot-moments of phosphorus loads in an agricultural watershed depend not only on the watershed characteristics but also on the type and intensity of storms. Not all storms will generate phosphorus that can be considered problematic. A threshold storm is thus proposed and defined as the maximum storm intensity in which the phosphorus generated in a watershed is below seasonal phosphorus tolerance limit. To evaluate the threshold storm approach, separate Agricultural Non-point Source (AGNPS) models for three diverse small agricultural watersheds in southern Ontario, Canada were calibrated for runoff volume, sediment yield, and total phosphorus and run for representative storms with increasing return periods (2-year through 100-year). Results showed that in an upland watershed (Holtby), a 4.8-year early spring storm tend to generate phosphorus load above the threshold limit for the season. The same for low-land watersheds (Wigle and Jeannette) were, respectively, 14.9-year and 12.4-year. In all three watersheds, summer storms up to 100-year will fail to reach the seasonal tolerance limit for phosphorus. The critical source areas, identified based on the threshold storms, were distributed uniformly across the watersheds. As a phosphorus problem is essentially a source problem, such a simple yet robust approach to identify critical source areas of phosphorus can be useful in designing cost-effective best management practices.

The pattern of the late glacial temperature changes in Lake Brazi show both similarities and some differences from the NGRIP 5180 record and other European chironomid-based reconstructions. Our reconstruction indicates that at Lake Brazi (1740 m a.s.I.) summer air temperature increased by similar to 2.8 degrees C at the Oldest Dryas/Bolling transition (GS-2/GI-1) and reached 8.1-8.7 degrees C during the late glacial interstade. The onset of the Younger Dryas (GS-1) was characterized by a weak (<1 degrees C) decrease in chironomid-inferred temperatures. Similarly, at the GS-1/Holocene transition no major changes in summer temperature were recorded. In the early Holocene. summer temperature increased in two steps and reached -12.0-13.3 degrees C during the Preboreal. Two short-term cold events were detected during the early Holocene between 11,480-11,390 and 10,350-10,190 cal yr BP. The first cooling coincides with the Preboreal oscillation and shows a weak (0.7 degrees C) temperature decrease, while the second is characterized by 1 C cooling. Both cold events coincide with cooling events in the Greenland ice core records and other European temperature reconstructions.

Peatland formation, succession and carbon accumulation at a mid-elevation poor fen in Pacific Canada	HOLOCENE												We reconstructed peatland formation, succession and long-term rates of carbon (C) accumulation at a mid-elevation poor fen on Vancouver Island in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Multi-proxy paleoecological analyses including bulk chemistry, peat composition, macrofossils, pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs show terrestrialization starting from a small oligotrophic lake 14,000 cal BP. Peat accumulation began by 11,600 cal BP with the transition to an emergent Nuphar-dominated shallow-water marsh. Terrestrialization in the center of the peatland was more or less complete by 10,400 cal BP with the development of a Sphagnum-dominated poor fen that continues to the present. Outward expansion by paludification appears to have brought the peatland close to its modern lateral extent by 10,000 cal BP, suggesting that terrestrialization and paludification played important concurrent roles in the early development of this poor fen. Mean long-term rates of C accumulation (13 g C/m(2)/yr) are lower than at most Northern Hemisphere peatlands including nearby lowland bogs. Maximum rates of 43 g C/m(2)/yr occurred in the early Holocene during accumulation of Nuphar peat and the transition to Sphagnum peat and coincided with high summer temperatures and increased seasonality, which promote growing season productivity and reduce winter decomposition. Early Holocene increases in C accumulation rates occurred at two nearby lowland bogs during similar wetland stages. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that climate and autogenic succession, including changes in relative water table depth and plant functional groups, interacted to drive Holocene peatland dynamics and C accumulation rates in the maritime setting of coastal British Columbia.					; Lacourse, Terri/G-5647-2012; Adeleye, Matthew/ABA-5621-2022	Adeleye, Matthew/0000-0002-6034-5807; Lacourse, Terri/0000-0002-7559-5374; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				NOV	2019	29	11					1694	1707	0959683619862041	10.1177/0959683619862041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683619862041		JUL 2019											WOS:000477254700001

Most of the parameters exhibited a significant spatial and seasonal variation. It revealed that the coastal water was significantly influenced by freshwater input from the nearby backwaters during North-east monsoon and post-monsoon periods. A marginal increase in pH from coast towards offshore was noticed during the observation. Relatively low salinity values were observed during pre and post monsoon when compared to summer. Bottom water was found to be highly turbid during summer and pre-monsoon conditions when compared to surface. This could be attributed to the strong northerly wind and northward current prior to the onset of southwest monsoon. N, P and Si based nutrients are relatively high in their concentration in the bottom water. Nitrate was significantly high during post-monsoon and contributed greatly towards total nitrogen as evident from the statistical correlation. Ammonia concentration was relatively high in the bottom samples during all the seasons except on a few occasions during post-monsoon. In general, phosphate and total phosphorous values remained low and particularly so in the surface water. Higher silicate concentration was observed in the bottom water, and there was a reducing trend towards offshore. High chlorophyll-a values were observed during summer and surface water was found to have higher pigment concentrations as compared to the bottom. Results show that phosphate acts as the limiting factor for phytoplankton production particularly during post-monsoon period whereas; none of the nutrients were found to be limiting the phytoplankton growth during other seasons.

We used a large set of observations from 1890 to 2020 of the timing of freeze-up and break-up, and the length of ice-free season, for 101 Norwegian lakes to elucidate variation in ice phenology across time and space. The dataset of Norwegian lakes is unusual, covering considerable variation in elevation (4-1401 m a.s.l.) and climate (from oceanic to continental) within a substantial latitudinal and longitudinal gradient (58.2-69.9 degrees N, 4.9-30.2 degrees E). The average date of ice break-up occurred later in spring with increasing elevation, latitude and longitude. The average date of freeze-up and the length of the ice-free period decreased significantly with elevation and longitude. No correlation with distance from the ocean was detected, although the geographical gradients were related to regional climate due to adiabatic processes (elevation), radiation (latitude) and the degree of continentality (longitude). There was a significant lake surface area effect as small lakes froze up earlier due to less volume. There was also a significant trend that lakes were completely frozen over later in the autumn in recent years. After accounting for the effect of long-term trends in the large-scale North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, a significant but weak trend over time for earlier ice break-up was detected. An analysis of different time periods revealed significant and accelerating trends for earlier break-up, later freeze-up and completely frozen lakes after 1991. Moreover, the trend for a longer ice-free period also accelerated during this period, although not significantly. An understanding of the relationship between ice phenology and geographical parameters is a prerequisite for predicting the potential future consequences of climate change on ice phenology. Changes in ice phenology will have consequences for the behaviour and life cycle dynamics of the aquatic biota.

J	HAIRSTON, NG				HAIRSTON, NG			ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE OF COLOR POLYMORPHISM IN 2 SPECIES OF DIAPTOMUS (COPEPODA)	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												In the Lower Grand Coulee, Washington [USA], D. nevadensis in Soap Lake contains larger amounts of the carotenoid astaxanthin than in Lake Lenore. During winter, D. sicilis contains larger amounts of pigment in both lakes, but in summer individuals from Lake Lenore are much reduced in pigment while those from Soap Lake are unchanged. The amount of astaxanthin might be a reflection of the amount of pigment in the copepods'' diet or might reflect the relative importance of selective forces acting for and against pigmentation. Seasonal variations in copepod carotenoid content did not correspond with variations in total lipid content. Algal abundance was measured by chlorophyll a, and plant carotenoids correlated with copepod carotenoids only in the case of D. nevadensis in Soap Lake. The percent of D. nevadensis guts containing algae was correlated with their pigment content in both lakes. Visually oriented predators, such as damselfly nymphs from both lakes and salamander larvae from Lake Lenore, selected red copepods, but few predators from Lake Lenore, contained D. nevadensis. Since members of this species were rare, the probability of finding a predator that had consumed one was low. When fed identical diets copepods from Lake Lenore were 1/5-1/30 as efficient at assimilating carotenoid as those from Soap Lake. The hypothesis that the pigment differences are the result of natural selection is supported. Selective predation is implicated as the explanation for the small amounts of pigment in Lake Lenore copepods.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1979	24	1					15	37		10.4319/lo.1979.24.1.0015	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1979.24.1.0015													WOS:A1979GJ26100002

Fifty-one acute toxicity tests were conducted, with LC50 values ranging from 85 .mu.g/L for the white sucker Catastomus commersoni during the summer to greater than 7,770 .mu.g/L for the isopod Asellus racovitzai during the winter. The effect of PCP on growth and/or reproduction was determined for seven species. The most sensitive chronically exposed organisms were the cladoceran Ceriodaphnia reticulata and the snail Physa gyrina. Both were adversely affected at the lowest concentrations tested, i.e., 4.1 and 26 .mu.g/L, respectively. The duckweed Lemna minor was the least sensitive, with no apparent effects after exposure for 21 d to concentrations as high as 1,440 .mu.g/L. The greatest variation in toxicity was due to species sensitivity. Within a given season there was as much as a 40-fold difference in LC50 values between species. For any one species, the maximum variation in LC50 between seasons was aproximately 14-fold. There were also substantial differences in acute-chronic relationships, with acute/chronic ratios ranging from greater than 37 for C. reticulata to 1 for Simocephalus vetulus. It is suggested that the composition of the aquatic community should be the most important consideration in estimating the potential environmental effects of PCP.

Monitoring water quality and its variability can help control water pollution. However, traditional monitoring techniques of water quality are time-consuming and laborious, and can mostly conduct with sample point-to-point at the edge of lakes and rivers. In this study, an empirical (regression-based) model is proposed to retrieve Chl-a, TN, and TP concentrations in the Yangtze River by Landsat-8 images from 2014 to 2020. The spatial-temporal distribution and variability of water quality in the whole Yangtze River are analyzed in detail. Furthermore, the driving forces of water quality variations are explored. The results show that the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the water quality parameters are 25.88%, 4.3%, and 8.37% for Chl-a, TN, and TP concentrations, respectively, and the root mean square errors (RMSE) are 0.475 mu g/L, 0.110 mg/L, and 0.01 mg/L, respectively. The concentrations of Chl-a, TN, and TP in the upstream of the Yangtze River are lower than those in the midstream and downstream. These water quality parameters have a seasonal cycle with a maximum in summer and minimum in winter. The hydrological and meteorological factors such as water level, flow, temperature, and precipitation are positively correlated with Chl-a, TN, and TP concentrations. The larger the impervious surface and cropland area, the greater the cargo handling capacity (CHC), higher ratio of TP to TN will further pollute the water. The methods and results provide essential information to evaluate and control water pollution in the Yangtze River.

The precipitation is found to have an insignificant effect on the lake in an arid climate environment. Hydrogen and oxygen isotopic evidence presents at least two aquifer contributions that recharge 87% and 13% water supply of the lake, respectively.

Most species showed increasing trends (80% during breeding, 62% in winter), including both initially common and rare species, suggesting a positive effect of site protection policies that were mainly applied in the 1980s. Specialised freshwater species such as diving ducks and coots did not show population recovery, most probably due to the characteristic tendency of shallow lagoons to remain eutrophic even after several decades of the implementation of sewage management and water purification. In fact re-introduction of a diet-specialist (red-knobbed coot) failed but that of a diet-generalist (purple swamphen) succeeded. Waterfowl hunting and the abandonment of rural practices also probably played a role in the lack of recovery by some species. Population trends of breeding species were more dependent on local conditions than trends of wintering populations. Body size could also have some influence on growth rates because some of the smallest species of shorebirds and Laridae (such as Kentish plovers, little terns and black-headed gulls) showed decreasing trends in one or both seasons. Finally, a few species were gained for the system as new wintering species, probably due to climate warming. Our results suggest that growth rates alone are poor descriptors of population fluctuations, especially for birds and other vagile taxa, and that it is more appropriate to interpret trends when considering natural regions spatially, and when growth rates are analysed within the time scale of the theoretical logistic curve.

However, significant uncertainty remains about 21st century precipitation changes in this semi -arid region. Paleoclimatic records are essential for both contextualizing current change, and for helping constrain the sensitivity of regional hydroclimate to large-scale global climate. In this paper, we present a new 2.8 Ma to present compound -specific isotopic record from Clayton Valley, the site of a long-lived paleolake in the southern Great Basin. Hydrogen and carbon isotopes from terrestrial plant leaf waxes provide evidence of past shifts in rainfall seasonality as well as ecosystem structure, and help contextualize the formation of this lithium -rich lacustrine basin. Our results suggest that regional hydroclimates underwent a substantial reorganization at the Plio-Pleistocene boundary, especially between 2.6 and 2.0 Ma. In this interval, a reduced latitudinal temperature gradient in the North Pacific likely resulted in a northward shift in storm tracks, and a reduction in winter rainfall over the southern Great Basin. This occurred against a background of increased summer rainfall and a greater accumulation of lithium in the lake basin. Our interpretation is corroborated by a compilation of Plio-Pleistocene north Pacific sea surface temperature records, as well as an isotope -enabled model simulation. Overall, these results suggest that past shifts in rainfall seasonality helped set the stage for the development and dessication of lithium -rich lacustrine deposits.					; Feng, Ran/HPE-3363-2023; Ibarra, Daniel/E-6141-2013; Boutt, David/G-1146-2010	Boutt, David/0000-0003-1397-0279; Brennan, Peter/0000-0002-4204-6088; Terrazas, Alexa/0009-0004-8801-3822; Butler, Kristina/0000-0001-7472-7884													0277-3791	1873-457X				JUL 1	2024	335								108747	10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108747	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108747		JUN 2024											WOS:001258673400001
J	Lathrop, RC; Carpenter, SR				Lathrop, Richard C.; Carpenter, Stephen R.			Water quality implications from three decades of phosphorus loads and trophic dynamics in the Yahara chain of lakes	INLAND WATERS												Trophic responses to phosphorus (P) loads spanning 29-33 years were assessed for the eutrophic Yahara chain of lakes: Mendota (area = 39.6 km(2), mean depth = 12.7 m, flushing rate = 0.23 yr(-1)); Monona (13.7 km(2), 8.3 m, 1.3 yr(-1)); Waubesa (8.5 km(2), 4.7 m, 4.3 yr(-1)); and Kegonsa (13.0 km(2), 5.1 m, 3.0 yr(-1)). During extended drought periods with low P loads, summer (Jul-Aug) total P (TP) concentrations declined substantially in all 4 lakes, with Mendota achieving mesotrophic conditions (<0.024 mg L-1). In years when P loads were high due to major runoff events, summer TP in the lakes was high (especially in shallower Waubesa and Kegonsa); in some summers dissolved inorganic P was elevated, indicating algae growth was not P limited. Summer TP returned to normal levels following both low and high load years, signifying the lakes were responsive to P load changes. The proportion of P input loads passed via a lake's outlet to the next lake downstream increased as flushing rates increased. Because Monona, Waubesa, and Kegonsa received 60, 83, and 76% of their surface water P load from the respective upstream lake's outlet, reducing P loads in Mendota's large watershed was predicted to produce significant water quality benefits downstream. Modeling indicated a significant grazing effect of Daphnia on summer TP and Secchi transparency readings for Mendota and Monona. Finally, using drought loads as targets, our study established P loading reductions needed to improve water quality in all 4 Yahara lakes.

Phytoplankton was dominated, during the whole year, by small-sized organisms (10 to 25-mu-m). Bacteria were in a majority small coccoids (< 0.3-mu-m). Phyto- and bacterioplankton abundances averaged respectively 3.3 x 10(6) cells l-1 and 6 x 10(9) cells l-1. The phasing of the activity and biomass periods suggest a close coupling between phyto- and bacterioplankton. There were two distinct periods of high activity and biomass. Maximal values were observed in summer but an early increase occurred also in winter. Low or undetectable phytoplankton excretion rates, when heterotrophic activity was maximum, indicated a bacterial uptake of up to 100% of the released algal products during the incubation period. Heterotrophic uptake measurements with both glucose and amino acids revealed a seasonal change of the substrates in the lake, glucose uptake being associated more with the maximum activity of the algae, while the amino acids uptake was relatively higher during their decline. The maximal photosynthetic rate averaged 21.5 mgC m-3 h-1 and mean Vmax values were 0.056 and 0.050 mgC m-3 h-1 respectively for glucose and amino acids uptake.

The bioavailable phosphorus (BAP) in suspended sediments accounted for about 44% of the total particulate P (TPP). Concentrations of BAP and TPP were significantly higher in the summer than in the winter, due to the presence of material of biogenic origin entering the river from Lake Erie. Apatite-P, generally considered to be biologically inert in aquatic environments, accounted for about 26% of the TPP. The calculated annual loadings of particulate BAP and TPP in 1987 were 0.92 x 10(6) and 2.04 x 10(6) kg/year, respectively. In 1988 the calculated BAP and TPP loadings from suspended sediments were 0.91 x 10(6) and 2.03 x 10(6) kg/year, respectively. The results indicate that only about 45% of the TPP load is bioavailable and is of environmental significance. This has important implications for implementation of phosphorus control programs and for the lakewide management plans considered now for Lake Ontario.

J	Aregahegn, Z; Zerihun, M				Aregahegn, Zeyede; Zerihun, Mulate			Study on Irrigation Water Quality in the Rift Valley Areas of Awash River Basin, Ethiopia	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL SOIL SCIENCE												Awash River water has been impaired by various types of pollution owing to waste released from different socioeconomic activities in its basin. This study aimed to evaluate the water quality of the Awash River and its tributaries in the basin used for irrigation purposes. Sampling sites were identified based on the pollution sources, accessibility, and land-use coverage. A total of 17 sampling sites were chosen along the Awash River, and samplings were collected four times a year through different seasons. The overall water quality and suitability for irrigation are explained using multiple water quality parameters such as pH, EC, SAR, RSC, Na+, K+, Ca + Mg, CO32-, HCO3-, and Cl-. The obtained results showed that all quality parameters at Beseka Lake exceed the maximum permissible limit of suitability for irrigation. It is generally conceivable that the physicochemical characteristic of the Awash River varies in different water quality parameters at different sites. Only Beseka Lake and Meteka hot spring water exceeded pH and SAR permissible limit, and EC at Mojo, Wonji, Beseka, Melkasedi, Werer, Ambash, Meteka, and Meteka hot spring shows medium-to-high salinity scale, while RSC was very high at Beseka, Melkasedi, Meteka hot spring, Ambash, Meteka Mojo, Werer, Assayta, Wonji, Dupty, Tibila, Metehara, and Afambo, respectively. The establishment of wastewater treatment plants for industries and stormwater quality management at hotspot areas are recommended to improve the water quality, and dispatch proportion needs to be considered in the future.

Diet analysis of all five wintering species indicated a heavy reliance on seeds, which included a wide variety of aquatic plants, such as Myriophyllum spicatum, Ceratophyllum demersum, Sparganium erectum, Scirpus lacustris and Potamogeton pectinatus. Noteworthy is the paucity of ingested macroinvertebrates. Despite dietary overlap, the type, abundance and frequency of food consumed clearly indicated differences in resource use among the ducks. Incidentally, the study also highlighted the high vulnerability of threatened ducks to poaching (harvesting and disturbance) in a protected area.

Here we present an 8600-year sediment record from Xingyun Lake in Yunnan, China, a transitional zone that receives inputs of precipitation from both the ISM and EASM. Analysis of stable oxygen isotopes (delta O-18) from authigenic calcite yields a semi-quantitative estimate of the timing and magnitude of lake level change that reflects changes in effective moisture from monsoon variability. Between 8600 and 6900 years BP, delta O-18 values are stable and low, indicating high lake levels and overflowing conditions resulting from a strong ISM. After 6900 years BP, delta O-18 values shift to higher values, which we suggest reflects a weakening of the ISM caused by declining summer insolation. The most substantial positive shift in isotopes occurs from 5000 to 4300 years BP and is coincident with aridity in India and the Tibetan Plateau. Other proxy records indicate increased ENSO variability and a southward shift in the ITCZ, which has an effect on the strength and onset of the ISM and may account for this change in hydrologic balance. After 4300 years BP, delta O-18 values continue to increase reflecting a gradual drying trend, but increases are smaller than prior periods, in part due to lake bathymetry that limits the potential for isotopic enrichment driven by evaporation. The relative influence of the ISM and EASM in the Yunnan Province of China during the Holocene remains a topic for future study, but our results suggest the predominance of the ISM and a possible connection to ENSO patterns on centennial to millennial timescales.

Responses were quantified by modelling the proportional biovolumes of a given group along the eutrophication gradient, using generalized additive models. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) was chosen as a proxy for eutrophication because all classes showed more consistent responses to Chl-a than to total phosphorus. Chrysophytes often dominate in (ultra-) oligotrophic lakes, and showed a clear decrease along the eutrophication gradient. Pennate diatoms were found to be most abundant at moderate eutrophication level (spring-samples). Cyanobacteria often dominate under eutrophic conditions, especially in clearwater lakes at Chl-a levels > 10 mu g l(-1) stop (late summer samples). We compare the relationships among types of lakes, based on the lake typology of the northern geographic intercalibration group, and among countries sharing common lake types. Significant differences were found especially between humic and clearwater lakes, and between low- and moderately alkaline lakes, but we could not identify significant differences between shallow and deep lakes. Country-specific differences in response curves were especially pronounced between lakes in Norway and Finland, while Swedish lakes showed an intermediate pattern, indicating that country-specific differences reflect large-scale geographic and climatic differences in the study area.

Seasonal and nutrients intake regulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in grazing yak (Bos grunniens) in the Alpine Regions around Qinghai Lake	LIVESTOCK SCIENCE												Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is considered as a key enzyme in the lipid deposition and metabolism in tissues. To better understand fat cycling in grazing yak to adapt to the harsh environment on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, and we have therefore explored seasonal and nutritional regulation of LPL in adipose tissue, liver and skeletal muscle. Sixty 3 year old growing yaks (BW. 120.3 +/- 15.28 kg) were subdivided into six groups, each used to determine effects on chemical body composition and LPL activity in different tissues. The alpine pastures had the highest Crude protein (CP, 11.06%) contents and the gross energy (GE, 11.49 MJ/kg) in summer. Growth rates and body fat content were responsive to CP and GE intake regimen. Late spring up-regulation of LPL activity in the subcutaneous adipose tissue was consistent with a pronounced increase of body weight (BW) and whole body fat content. The highest LPL activity in the skeletal muscle was found in September (774 +/- 64.1 mU/g tissue), which may serve to cover the increased energy demands for compensatory growth and maintenance of adiposity in the coming cold season. Furthermore, the seasonal regulation of LPL involves some factors in addition to insulin and triglycerides (TG). These results suggest that yaks could rely, in part, on LPL activity to adapt to the harsh forage environment. During the growing season, an enhanced synthesis of LPL production in the adipose tissues along with mechanisms for the recycling of fat contributes toward the rapid recovery of body weight.

This paper reviews the occurrence of potentially toxic cyanobacterial blooms and the level of microcystins in freshwater ecosystems in Vojvodina region (northern Serbia). The appearance of cyanobacterial mass growth was monitored in 16 different freshwater bodies during the period autumn 2005-summer 2006. The concentration of microcystins in water samples was measured by a protein phosphatase inhibition assay (PP1). The results have shown that more than 50% of all examined fresh waters in Vojvodina region are sites with frequent cyanobacterial proliferation. Massive occurrences of some potentially toxic species that belong to the cyanobacterial genera Microcystis, Aphanizomenon, Anabaena, Oscillatoria and Planktothrix were detected. During the period of investigation, the toxins were permanently present in almost all investigated ecosystems. The concentrations of microcystins, calculated as microcystin-LR equivalents, were within the 0.95-603.61 mu g L-1 range. This is the first reported finding of microcystins in that region of southeastern Europe. This paper also reviews microcystin contents in some bloom-causing cyanobacterial strains, and the values detected ranged from 0.19 to 9.16 mu g microcystin-LR equivalents mg(-1) dry weight (dw). This study demonstrates a high prevalence of microcystin-producing cyanobacterial strains in Serbian freshwaters and, therefore, regular monitoring is highly desirable in order to minimize health risks associated with the usage of the investigated freshwaters.					; Karaman, Maja/C-6938-2013; Knezevic, Petar/P-1048-2015	Svircev, Zorica/0000-0001-8355-7661; Knezevic, Petar/0000-0003-0353-3892													1018-4619	1610-2304					2010	19	2					198	207																WOS:000275759000009

However, well-validated satellite imagery has remained elusive for Lake Superior. Lake Superior's optical properties are highly influenced by colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), which has hindered the retrieval of chlorophyll concentration through band-ratio algorithms. This study evaluated seven existing inversion algorithms. The top-performing inversion algorithm was tuned to a Lake Superior optical data set and applied to satellite imagery. The retrieval of chlorophyll concentration via inversion algorithms was not possible due to errors in derived CDOM absorption being greater than phytoplankton absorption values and the very small contribution of phytoplankton absorption to the overall absorption budget. However, the retrieval of absorption due to CDOM from satellite imagery was encouraging. To ensure that the best satellite remotely sensed reflectance estimates were used in the retrieval of absorption due to CDOM, several atmospheric correction schemes were evaluated. The absorption due to CDOM was greatest in the western arm of Lake Superior and near river mouths and decreased with distance offshore. The absorption due to CDOM had a bimodal distribution over the annual cycle with the greatest peak in fall and a smaller peak in spring.

In 1978, salinity directly under the ice was 66 parts-per-thousand and repeated net hauls found no zooplankton. In 1983, adults of D. bispinosus were found, and in 1984, a reproductively active population of this species. Surface water salinity in 1984 was 56 parts-per-thousand. During winter 1986, surface salinity was 54 parts-per-thousand and three zooplankton species (D. bispinosus, O. curvata and an undescribed cydippid ctenophore) had established populations in the lake. In 1986/87, high tides caused nearby Taynaya Bay to flood into the lake, and three further species (the calanoid, Paralabidocera antarctica, and two harpacticoids, Harpacticus furcatus and Idomene sp.) were found in the lake. It appears that periodic flooding after 1978 caused a salinity decrease in the lake from 66 to 54 parts-per-thousand, and this enabled some invertebrate species to maintain year-round populations, whereas others require marine incursions to re-establish summer only populations.																			0018-8158					MAR 1	1991	210	1-2					93	99		10.1007/BF00014325	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014325													WOS:A1991FF63500008
J	Taylor, SC				Taylor, SC			Salt Lake City and stereotypes of the Russians	PACIFIC HISTORICAL REVIEW												Salt Lake City and Russia were drawn together by the Cold War. The city, economically based on the defense industry, was a potential target, linking it directly to the Soviet Union. President Ronald Reagan's answer to the Soviet threat was the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), nicknamed Star Wars, aimed at a Russia stereotyped as a formidable and implacable adversary. Attitudes toward Russia have changed since the Cold War's end through increased Utah-based personal contacts: emigration, LDS missionary programs, and military and cultural connections. Utahns have increasingly appreciated Russian diversity, cultural heritage, and talent. My own views were considerably modified when I held a Fulbright Senior Lectureship to Moscow in the winter-spring term of 2001 and encountered enthusiastic and informed students. As we studied the history of the Cold War, we adjusted our assumptions about one another. September 11, 2001, dramatically altered the outdated Cold War image of Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin's immediate support of America against Islamic terrorists drew the two nations closer. Salt Lakers and other Utahns shared this transformed attitude. Although Utah is still a part of the military-industrial complex, blind hatred of the Russians no longer forms the backdrop to the dimension of its economy and culture.																			0030-8684					FEB	2002	71	1					1	18		10.1525/phr.2002.71.1.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/phr.2002.71.1.1													WOS:000174284300001
J	Forester, RM; Lowenstein, TK; Spencer, RJ				Forester, RM; Lowenstein, TK; Spencer, RJ			An ostracode based paleolimnologic and paleohydrologic history of Death Valley: 200 to 0 ka	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Death Valley, a complex tectonic and hydrologic basin, was cored from its lowest surface elevation to a depth of 186 m. The sediments range from bedded primary halite to black muds. Continental ostracodes found in the black muds indicate that those sediments were deposited in a variety of hydrologic settings ranging from deep, relatively fresh water to shallow saline lakes to spring discharge supported wetlands. The alkaline-enriched, calcium-depleted paleolake waters indicate extrabasinal streamflow and basin-margin spring discharge. The alkaline-depleted, calcium-enriched paleowetland waters indicate intrabasinal spring discharge. During Marine Isotope Stage 6 (MIS 6, ca. 180-140 ka) the hydrologic settings were highly variable, implying that complex relations existed between climate and basin hydrology. Termination II (MIS 6 to MIS 5E) was a complex multicyclic sequence of paleoenvironments, implying that climates oscillated between high and low effective moisture. MIS 4 (ca. 73-61 ka) was a spring discharge supported wetland complex. During MIS 2 (ca. 20-12 ka) the hydrologic settings were variable, although they are not fully understood because some black muds deposited during that time were lost during coring.																			0016-7606	1943-2674				NOV-DEC	2005	117	11-12					1379	1386		10.1130/B25637.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B25637.1													WOS:000233072400001

Decadal-Scale Changes in the Seasonal Surface Water Balance of the Central United States from 1984 to 2007	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												Variations in climate have important influences on the hydrologic cycle. Observations over the continental United States in recent decades show substantial changes in hydrologically significant variables, such as decreases in cloud cover and increases in solar radiation (i.e., solar brightening), as well as increases in air temperature, changes in wind speed, and seasonal shifts in precipitation rate and rain/snow ratio. Impacts of these changes on the regional water cycle from 1984 to 2007 are evaluated using a terrestrial ecosystem/land surface hydrologic model (Agro-IBIS). Results show an acceleration of various components of the surface water balance in the Upper Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, and Great Lakes basins over the 24-yr period, but with significant seasonal and spatial complexity. Evapotranspiration (ET) has increased across most of our study domain and seasons. The largest increase is found in fall, when solar brightening trends are also particularly significant. Changes in runoff are characterized by distinct spatial and seasonal variations, with the impact of precipitation often being muted by changes in ET and soil-water storage rate. In snow-dominated regions, such as the northern Great Lakes basin, spring runoff has declined significantly due to warmer air temperatures and an associated decreasing ratio of snow in total precipitation during the cold season. In the northern Missouri basin, runoff shows large increases in all seasons, primarily due to increases in precipitation. The responses to these changes in the regional hydrologic cycle depend on the underlying land cover type-maize, soybean, and natural vegetation. Comparisons are also made with other hydroclimatic time series to place the decadal-scale variability in a longer-term context.

Solutes are supplied mainly by a series of alkaline hot springs with temperatures as high as 86 degrees C. Previous culture-dependent and culture-independent studies have revealed diverse groups of microorganisms thriving under these conditions. Previous culture independent studies were based on the analysis of 16S rDNA but were done on less saline lakes. For the first time, this study combined illumina sequencing and analysis of amplicons of both total community rDNA and 16S rRNA cDNA to determine the diversity and community structure of bacteria and archaea within 3 hot springs of L. Magadi and little Magadi. Methods: Water, wet sediments and microbial mats were collected from springs in the main lake at a temperature of 45.1 degrees C and from Little Magadi "Nasikie eng'ida" (temperature of 81 degrees C and 83.6 degrees C). Total community DNA and RNA were extracted from samples using phenol-chloroform and Trizol RNA extraction protocols respectively. The 16S rRNA gene variable region (V4 - V7) of the extracted DNA and RNA were amplified and library construction performed following Illumina sequencing protocol. Sequences were analyzed done using QIIME while calculation of Bray-Curtis dissimilarities between datasets, hierarchical clustering, Non Metric Dimensional Scaling (NMDS) redundancy analysis (RDA) and diversity indices were carried out using the R programming language and the Vegan package. Results: Three thousand four hundred twenty-six and one thousand nine hundred thirteen OTUs were recovered from 16S rDNA and 16S rRNA cDNA respectively. Uncultured diversity accounted for 89.35 % 16S rDNA and 87.61 % 16S rRNA cDNA reads. The most abundant phyla in both the 16S rDNA and 16S rRNA cDNA datasets included: Proteobacteria (8.33-50 %), Firmicutes 3.52-28.92 %, Bacteroidetes (3.45-26.44 %), Actinobacteria (0.98-28.57 %) and Euryarchaeota (3.55-34.48 %) in all samples. NMDS analyses of taxonomic composition clustered the taxa into three groups according to sample types (i.e. wet sediments, mats and water samples) with evident overlap of clusters between wet sediments and microbial mats from the three sample types in both DNA and cDNA datasets. The hot spring (45.1 degrees C) contained less diverse populations compared to those in Little Magadi (81-83 degrees C). Conclusion: There were significant differences in microbial community structure at 95 % level of confidence for both total diversity (P value, 0.009) based on 16S rDNA analysis and active microbial diversity (P value, 0.01) based on 16S rRNA cDNA analysis, within the three hot springs. Differences in microbial composition and structure were observed as a function of sample type and temperature, with wet sediments harboring the highest diversity.

Synchrony of alewife, Alosa pseudoharengus, year-class strength in the Great Lakes region	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Fish recruitment is interannually variable and challenging to predict. Annual recruitment is often regionally synchronized among populations and identifying drivers of such synchrony may help shed light on recruitment dynamics. We investigated interannual variation of alewife Alosa pseudoharengus recruitment by estimating year-class strength for populations from three of the Laurentian Great Lakes (lakes Huron, Michigan, and Ontario) using annual assessment survey data from 1968 to 2022. We first determined the age when year-class strength was set for each dataset. We then used a mixed-modeling approach incorporating age, year-class, and sampling year to estimate year-class strength for each study lake. Thereafter, we evaluated regional synchrony in year-class strength across the three lakes and evaluated potential climatic drivers of synchrony. Our results suggest that alewife year-class strength is set by age-1. Our model-derived indices of alewife year-class strength were synchronized among the three lakes, and we identified spring-summer degree-days as a potential regional driver of synchrony. This analysis highlights the potential for strong influence of climatic conditions on fish recruitment in large freshwater systems.

J	Toffolon, M; Yousefi, A; Piccolroaz, S				Toffolon, Marco; Yousefi, Azadeh; Piccolroaz, Sebastiano			Estimation of the Thermally Reactive Layer in Lakes Based on Surface Water Temperature	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												How fast does lake surface water temperature (LSWT) react to climate warming or cooling? The thermal response of lakes varies with the season and, typically, day-to-day fluctuations are larger in summer. The reason is that lakes are stratified systems where the thermally reactive volume is smaller in summer and, hence, its heat capacity (thermal inertia) is reduced. We define the dimensionless parameter delta as the ratio between the surface volume reacting to the net heat flux through the air-water interface and the volume of the whole lake. By referring to a fully controlled case study obtained by means of a one-dimensional physically based model (Simstrat), we investigate the variability of delta throughout the year and its dependence on LSWT. Then, we compare the results with the parameterization adopted in the hybrid data-driven model air2water. Our analysis confirms that delta follows an exponential decay with increasing LSWT (i.e., a thinner surface layer in summer), and shows that this functional dependence varies between the warming and the cooling periods. These findings contribute to the understanding of the effect of a warming climate on water bodies and ecosystems by providing a simple tool to estimate the rate of change in lakes' water temperature.					; Piccolroaz, Sebastiano/AAJ-7627-2021; Toffolon, Marco/D-4845-2011	Yousefi, Azadeh/0000-0003-1029-3962; Piccolroaz, Sebastiano/0000-0003-1796-7624; Toffolon, Marco/0000-0001-6825-7070													0043-1397	1944-7973				JUN	2022	58	6							e2021WR031755	10.1029/2021WR031755	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021WR031755													WOS:000813940400001
J	Cirmo, CP; Driscoll, CT				Cirmo, CP; Driscoll, CT			The impacts of a watershed CaCO3 treatment on stream and wetland biogeochemistry in the Adirondack Mountains	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Temporal and longitudinal variations in the chemistry of two tributary streams of Woods Lake in the Adirondack Mountains of New York were monitored before and after a watershed CaCO3 application. One subcatchment of the lake had a large beaver pond and wetland at its headwaters, while the second was free-flowing. Treatment of both subcatchments with CaCO3 resulted in an immediate increase in acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) associated with Ca2+ release. The extent and duration of the response to the treatment were greater in the wetland-impacted stream. Aluminum was retained and complexed with organic solutes generated within the beaver-pond. In the free-flowing stream, NO3- concentration increased significantly after the manipulation; this pattern was not evident in the wetland-impacted stream. Net retention of SO42- was evident in the beaver pond prior to and following treatment, and this response was enhanced after the watershed liming. Comparisons of beaver pond inlet/outlet concentrations, mass balance calculations, and in-pond profiles of chemical parameters revealed patterns of retention of SO42-, NO3- and Al, and release of Fe2+, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and NH4+ in the wetland during the summer before CaCO3 treatment. Post-treatment releases df Ca2+ from the near-sediment zone in the beaver pond corresponded to anoxic periods in mid- to late-summer and under ice in winter. These findings demonstrate the importance of increased microbial processing of organic matter, along with high partial pressure of CO2 (Pco(2)) in facilitating the dissolution of the applied CaCO3. Dissolved silica (H4SiO4) was retained in the wetland during the summer prior to treatment but was released after the manipulation. This phenomenon may reflect the dissolution of diatom frustules or silicate minerals in the wetland at higher pH and DOC concentrations. Within two years of the CaCO3 treatment 60% of the CaCO3 applied to the beaver pond and surrounding wetland was dissolved and transported from the pond, in contrast to only 2.2% of the CaCO3 applied to the upland subcatchment draining into the wetland. These results, coupled with high quantities of exchangeable Ca2+ found in sediments and on Sphagnum mosses in the pond, demonstrate the importance of hydrologic source areas and wetlands in facilitating the dissolution of added CaCO3, and in regulating the production of chemical species important in ANC generation.

Of nine sampling locations situated along the full 60 m length of the springbrook, the source had by far the highest density of mites. Mites were most abundant in winter, reaching 1 individual/1.3 cm2 of substrate at the soruce, and least abundant in summer. Males were present, but uncommon, usually composing less than 10% of the adult population. Most collected females were gravid, regardless of season. Population age structure was inverted, with older instars being more abundant. There were no pulsed increases in density of immatures relative to adults, suggesting that reproduction is not strongly seasonal. Both adults and immatures appear to be generalized grazers on the "aufwuchs" community of unicellular and filamentous algae, fungi, and other organisms coating substrate surfaces, but also feed on decaying higher plant material. New geographic records show a transcontinental distribution in Canada, and the first records for the United States and Australia are given. Newly recorded habitat types include riverbeds and the profundal zone of lakes. Out of water behavior suggests that terrestrial dispersal is unlikely, supporting the hypothesis that the species predates the breakup of the supercontinent Pangea, with local distributions perhaps dating from Pleistocene events. The life history of this species appears more K-selected than that of another aquatic oribatid mite, Hydrozetes lemnae.					; Williams, Drake/HKV-5714-2023; Hogg, Ian D./HNS-7393-2023	Hogg, Ian D./0000-0002-6685-0089; 													0008-4301	1480-3283				MAR	1988	66	3					622	629		10.1139/z88-093	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z88-093													WOS:A1988N226200012
J	Satoh, Y; Imai, S				Satoh, Yuhi; Imai, Shoko			Flux and pathway of iodine dissolution from brackish lake sediment in the northeast of Japan	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Sediment is one of the most important entities controlling the environmental dynamics of iodine. We previously evaluated the dissolution flux of iodine from aquatic sediment to its overlying water in a brackish lake through an incubation experiment with a sediment core sample, reporting the regulation factors of this flux, such as the temperature and oxygenic conditions. In this study, factors controlling the seasonal variation in the dissolution flux of iodine were investigated via an incubation experiment using the sediment core samples collected in autumn and summer. The dissolution flux in this study was significantly smaller than that reported in our previous study. The iodine concentration detected in the overlying water of the sediment during incubation in this study was positively correlated with the concentrations of some inorganic ions, such as Na+, Cl-, and SiO42- while these correlations were not confirmed in our previous study. As the dissolution of sedimentary iodine indudes two pathways, which are the diffusion of sedimentary pore water and degradation of organic matter on surface sediment, correlations potentially indicate that the dissolution flux estimated in this study has a larger contribution from sedimentary pore water than that in our previous study. In addition, the higher flux estimated in our previous study was considered to be caused by the larger contribution from iodine derived from the degradation of phytoplanktonic organic matter on surface sediment. Assuming that the dissolution fluxes estimated in the previous and present studies are representative of the fluxes during and excluding the high productivity season in Lake Obuchi, respectively, we estimated the annual flux at 2.7 g y(-1) m(2), which is comparable with our previous estimation.

J	Wensink, SM; Tiegs, SD				Wensink, Stacey M.; Tiegs, Scott D.			Shoreline hardening alters freshwater shoreline ecosystems	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Shoreline 'hardening' is a common anthropogenic activity that involves installation of structures, such as seawalls or riprap, at the waterline to protect waterfront property. Despite the ubiquity of this activity, the effects of hardening on shoreline ecosystems are not well understood. We evaluated the geomorphology, organic matter decomposition, washed-up organic material (wrack), and invertebrate communities on both aquatic and terrestrial (riparian) habitats of 7 natural and 7 riprap-hardened shorelines of Lake St Clair (Michigan, USA). Shorelines hardened by riprap differed from their natural counterparts in structure and function, with particularly pronounced effects in terrestrial shoreline habitats. Hardened shorelines were steeper and drier, and sediments were orders of magnitude larger than on natural shorelines. Organic-matter decomposition was slower at riprap than natural shorelines in terrestrial habitats, but did not differ between natural and riprap shorelines in aquatic habitats. Natural shorelines had much greater quantities of wrack, a lake-derived subsidy, than riprap shorelines in summer and autumn. The finding that natural shorelines had more wrack despite faster decomposition suggests that subsidy retention is impaired by riprap. Path analysis indicates that the large sediment size of riprap is the mechanism responsible for disrupting wrack accumulation. Invertebrate community composition in terrestrial habitats also differed between shoreline types, with snails and beetles more abundant on natural shorelines and ants more abundant on riprap. Exotic taxa, such as Asian earthworms (Amynthas sp.), cyanobacteria (Lyngbya wollei), and Phragmites, were prevalent on both natural and riprap shorelines. Overall, riprap shorelines differ greatly from natural shorelines in their structure and functioning, particularly in terrestrial habitats, and possess attributes of 'novel ecosystems'.					tiegs, scott/JXM-6032-2024														2161-9549	2161-9565				SEP	2016	35	3					764	777		10.1086/687279	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/687279													WOS:000381446500002
J	Brunke, M				Brunke, M			Stream typology and lake outlets - a perspective towards validation and assessment from northern Germany (Schleswig-Holstein)	LIMNOLOGICA												The objective of this paper is twofold: 1) to validate the German stream typology for Schleswig-Holstein, and 2) to develop an assessment system for lake outlets. The German stream typology, based on a top-down analysis of geomorphological variables, was validated using biotic data of streams in Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany. A null model analysis was conducted to test for differences between seven stream types (sand streams and rivers, gravel streams and rivers, partly-mineralic streams, limnic marsh streams, and lake outlets). The dataset compiled for the statistical analysis comprised 28 streams, 65 different sampling sites, 428 samples, and 296 taxa. The analysis confirmed all stream types except partly-mineralic streams, which showed faunal overlap with all types except gravel streams. Gravel streams were the most distinctive stream type. Lake outlets were shown to be a unique type, having a distinct macroinvertebrate fauna. Furthermore it was shown, that the species composition differed between lentic and lotic outlets. Canonical correspondence analysis of 19 investigated lake outlets revealed that characteristics of the lakes had only a minor effect on macroinvertebrate community structure. The developed assessment system of lake outlets was based on the habitat association of 132 macroinvertebrate taxa. Taxa were allotted to five categories of lake outlet preferences depending on the results from ordinations, frequency tables and abundance distributions. A qualitative and a quantitative lake outlet index (LTI) were tested with independent data sets. The quantitative LTIquan proved to be more robust and only slightly affected by seasonal changes in the macroinvertebrate community composition. Assessments of lake outlets based on macroinvertebrates should be conducted in spring and autumn to reduce the risk of misclassifications, in particular, for boundary cases rated between good and moderate quality classes.																			0075-9511					DEC	2004	34	4					460	478		10.1016/S0075-9511(04)80013-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0075-9511(04)80013-6													WOS:000226488500013
J	Szczucinska, A				Szczucinska, A.			Hydrogeochemical background based on spring waters (Lubuskie Lakeland, western Poland)	GEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL												Hydrogeochemical background determined for an investigated environment, defines characteristic range of its hydrochemical characteristics. This allows to observe the temporal changes of the chemical water properties taking place in the studied environments, such as due to human impact. The paper presents the results of study on the present-day hydrogeochemical background in the Lubuskie Lakeland, the region repeatedly covered by the ice sheets during the Pleistocene and little affected by anthropogenic impact. The hydrogeochemical background was established on a basis of physicochemical analyses of spring waters sampled every 3 months between November 2011 and October 2013 from 20 springs. Present-day hydrogeochemical background was assumed to be represented by values ranging between 16 and 84 percentiles. The ranges of hydrogeochemical background for the studied ions on the Lubuskie Lakeland, were in the lower range of the background considered for useful waters in Poland. The obtained results indicated that the studied spring waters were poorly diversified in terms of composition of main cations and anions, as well as electrical conductivity and total water hardness. However, large variability was observed for Fe-tot, Mn2+ and NO3 (-). Moreover, NO3 (-) and SO4 (2-) were noted in some cases to be in excess of national hydrogeochemical background values.																			0016-7029	1556-1968				DEC	2017	55	12					1164	1170		10.1134/S0016702917140051	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0016702917140051													WOS:000418074100010

Autecology of an arsenite chemolithotroph: Sulfide constraints on function and distribution in a geothermal spring	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Previous studies in an acid-sulfate-chloride spring in Yellowstone National Park found that microbial arsenite [As(III)] oxidation is absent in regions of the spring outflow channel where H2S exceeds similar to 5 mu M and served as a backdrop for continued efforts in the present study. Ex situ assays with microbial mat samples demonstrated immediate As(III) oxidation activity when H2S was absent or at low concentrations, suggesting the presence of As(III) oxidase enzymes that could be reactivated if H2S is removed. Cultivation experiments initiated with mat samples taken from along the H2S gradient in the outflow channel resulted in the isolation of an As (III)-oxidizing chemolithotroph from the low-H2S region of the gradient. The isolate was phylogenetically related to Acidicaldus and was characterized in vitro for spring-relevant properties, which were then compared to its distribution pattern in the spring as determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative PCR. While neither temperature nor oxygen requirements appeared to be related to the occurrence of this organism within the outflow channel, H2S concentration appeared to be an important constraint. This was verified by in vitro pure-culture modeling and kinetic experiments, which suggested that H2S inhibition of As(III) oxidation is uncompetitive in nature. In summary, the studies reported herein illustrate that H2S is a potent inhibitor of As(III) oxidation and will influence the niche opportunities and population distribution of As(III) chemolithotrophs.

We sampled a set of tropical lakes from the middle Rio Doce lacustrine system (Minas Gerais, Brazil) for two consecutive summers. Besides Zmix, we analyzed the visible light attenuation (Kd(PAR)), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), total suspended solids (TSS), and fetch. We also analyze the quality of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) through colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), spectral slope (S), DOC-specific absorbance (SUVA) and the ratio between the absorbance at 250 nm and 365 nm (E-250:365). Our results showed quite different results during the two years studied. In the summer of 2012, when there was higher rainfall, variations in Zmix were correlated to the optical factors associated with DOM quality, while in the drier summer of 2013 Chl-a, TSS and fetch were the variables that more explained Zmix. It suggests that DOM regulates the Zmix in the rainy periods in the studied tropical lakes and that control is determined by the balance between the DOM input (runoff) and output (such as photodegradafion) of the aquatic systems. In reduced rain conditions (summer 2013), the factors responsible by chemistry photodegradation of DOM were predominant, and the organic matter was no longer controlling Zmix, which was driven by internal mixing, productivity, and the wind (Chl-a, TSS and fetch). In this study we showed how changes in precipitation might cause shifts in the factors that regulate the epilimnion thickness in tropical lakes.					; Barbosa, Francisco/M-6225-2019; Bezerra-Neto, José/N-9202-2019; Brandão, Luciana/N-7947-2018; Bezerra-Neto, Jose Fernandes/K-8051-2018; Brighenti, Ludmila/H-5559-2016	Barbosa, Francisco Antonio/0000-0002-2026-6936; Bezerra-Neto, Jose Fernandes/0000-0002-8281-0810; 													0075-9511	1873-5851				JAN	2019	74						42	50		10.1016/j.limno.2018.10.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2018.10.004													WOS:000455405800007

Thermal processes of thermokarst lakes in the continuous permafrost zone of northern Siberia - observations and modeling (Lena River Delta, Siberia)	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Thermokarst lakes are typical features of the northern permafrost ecosystems, and play an important role in the thermal exchange between atmosphere and subsurface. The objective of this study is to describe the main thermal processes of the lakes and to quantify the heat exchange with the underlying sediments. The thermal regimes of five lakes located within the continuous permafrost zone of northern Siberia (Lena River Delta) were investigated using hourly water temperature and water level records covering a 3-year period (2009-2012), together with bathymetric survey data. The lakes included thermokarst lakes located on Holocene river terraces that may be connected to Lena River water during spring flooding, and a thermokarst lake located on deposits of the Pleistocene Ice Complex. Lakes were covered by ice up to 2m thick that persisted for more than 7 months of the year, from October until about mid-June. Lake-bottom temperatures increased at the start of the ice-covered period due to upward-directed heat flux from the underlying thawed sediment. Prior to ice break-up, solar radiation effectively warmed the water beneath the ice cover and induced convective mixing. Ice break-up started at the beginning of June and lasted until the middle or end of June. Mixing occurred within the entire water column from the start of ice break-up and continued during the ice-free periods, as confirmed by the Wedderburn numbers, a quantitative measure of the balance between wind mixing and stratification that is important for describing the biogeochemical cycles of lakes. The lake thermal regime was modeled numerically using the FLake model. The model demonstrated good agreement with observations with regard to the mean lake temperature, with a good reproduction of the summer stratification during the ice-free period, but poor agreement during the ice-covered period. Modeled sensitivity to lake depth demonstrated that lakes in this climatic zone with mean depths > 5m develop continuous stratification in summer for at least 1 month. The modeled vertical heat flux across the bottom sediment tends towards an annual mean of zero, with maximum downward fluxes of about 5Wm(-2) in summer and with heat released back into the water column at a rate of less than 1Wm(-2) during the ice-covered period. The lakes are shown to be efficient heat absorbers and effectively distribute the heat through mixing. Monthly bottom water temperatures during the ice-free period range up to 15 degrees C and are therefore higher than the associated monthly air or ground temperatures in the surrounding frozen permafrost landscape. The investigated lakes remain unfrozen at depth, with mean annual lake-bottom temperatures of between 2.7 and 4 degrees C.

The oocysts were found in 17 (2.4%) children. There was no association with age, sex or location of household. However, relatively higher rate of oocyst exclusion was found among 2-month- to 3-year-old groups (50%) and among children from villages (43%). Six children from the group of infected were additionally screened for general immunocompetence. Four of these exhibited signs of immunodepletion of IgA isotype in serum. This study has established that cryptosporidiosis occurred rather sporadically among children in the examined groups. Further study was undertaken to provide relevant information whether wild small mammals are a zoonotic reservoir of Cryptosporidium sp. Samples were collected from autumn 1989 until spring 1991 in northern Poland, District Mazury Lake. Twenty percent (66 of 330) of the examined mammals were naturally infected with Cryptosporidium sp.: 55 of 275 Clethrionomys glareolus, 6 of 39 Apodemus flavicollis, and 5 of 16 Sorex araneus were positive. The histological study clearly indicates that the population of C. glareolus was infected with C. parvum. Endogenous stages were found in duodenum near the pylorus. The intensity of infection in those animals was generally low, and relatively small numbers of trophozoites and oocysts were found. This report indicates that C glareolus and possibly other rodents have the potential to act as reservoirs for C parvum.																			0015-5683						1993	40	4					297	300											8013931					WOS:A1993NJ46800012
J	Henshaw, T; Laybourn-Parry, J				Henshaw, T; Laybourn-Parry, J			The annual patterns of photosynthesis in two large, freshwater, ultra-oligotrophic Antarctic lakes	POLAR BIOLOGY												The phytoplankton productivity and biomass of two large, freshwater Antarctic lakes (Vestfold Hills, eastern Antarctica) were investigated over a 12-month period. Crooked Lake was sampled at one site, while Lake Druzhby, a complex lake with two shallow and one deep basin, was subject to a more detailed investigation. Concentrations of chlorophyll a were usually below 1 mug l(-1), indicating ultra-oligotrophic conditions. Despite periodic low nutrient levels, low temperatures (range 0.4-2.8degreesC) and periodic poor light climate, some degree of photosynthesis was measurable throughout the year, including the dark winter phase. Snow cover had a pronounced impact on the light climate of the water column and inhibited photosynthesis. Mean rates of carbon fixation in the 0- to 15-m water column varied between 0 and 38.47 mug C l(-1) day(-1) in Crooked Lake and 0.24 and 37.68 mug C l(-1) day(-1) in Lake Druzhby. There were significant differences in the seasonal patterns of primary production between the basins of Lake Druzhby. The shallow basins had highest productivity in August, whereas the deep basin had highest rates in summer. Chlorophyll specific rates of photosynthesis or assimilation numbers [mug C (chl.a)(-1) h(-1)] varied between 0.05 and 44.9, and photosynthetic efficiency [mug C (chl. a)(-1) h(-1) mumol m(-2) s(-1)] between 0.02 and 5.19. The data suggest that the phytoplankton of these lakes is adapted to low irradiance levels, low temperatures and nutrient limitation.																			0722-4060	1432-2056				OCT	2002	25	10					744	752		10.1007/s00300-002-0402-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-002-0402-y													WOS:000178842800005
J	Ogorelec, Z; Brinker, A; Straile, D				Ogorelec, Ziga; Brinker, Alexander; Straile, Dietmar			Small but voracious: invasive generalist consumes more zooplankton in winter than native planktivore	NEOBIOTA												In recent years, Lake Constance has experienced an invasion and domination of three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in the pelagic zone, which has coincided with a decline in the native whitefish (Coregonus wartmanni) population. Similar massive invasions of sticklebacks into pelagic zones have been recognized also in marine areas or small lakes worldwide. However, their diet overlaps with native species is rarely evaluated, especially in the winter season, which often presents a bottleneck for fish survival. In this study, we compared the diet of pelagic sticklebacks with the diet of the substantially larger native whitefish in different seasons, to evaluate the threat of the recent stickleback invasion on whitefish populations. By monthly sampling of zooplankton and both fish species diets, we could demonstrate that sticklebacks select similar prey throughout most of the year and consume more prey than whitefish during the winter. With relations between prey availability and prey selection, interspecific and intraspecific seasonal diet variability and indices like a prey-specific index of relative importance, we discuss the importance of zooplankton species traits and abundance for whitefish and stickleback predation. This study shows that sticklebacks, despite their small size, represent a serious potential diet competitor to native planktivorous fish. Sticklebacks quickly adapt to new environments, and thus we advocate precautions regarding their introduction into similar lakes as Lake Constance, as this could cause irreversible ecological changes.

Because life today thrives not just in the temperate ocean and lakes but also in extreme conditions of temperature, salinity, and pH, there is a general assumption that any form of liquid water would be sufficient to support the origin of life as long as there are sources of chemical energy and simple organic compounds. We argue here that the first forms of life would be physically and chemically fragile and would be strongly affected by ionic solutes and pH. A hypothesis emerges from this statement that hot springs associated with volcanic land masses have an ionic composition more conducive to self-assembly and polymerization than seawater. Here we have compared the ionic solutes of seawater with those of terrestrial hot springs. We then describe preliminary experimental results that show how the hypothesis can be tested in a prebiotic analog environment.

In addition, these reconstructions help in comprehending the amplitude of natural temperature changes in the past, which can assist in evaluating the amplitude and rate of recent anthropogenic global warming. Here we present the first detailed Holocene mean July air temperature reconstruction based on chironomid assemblages from sediments retrieved from Laguna de Rio Seco, an alpine lake in Sierra Nevada, southern Spain. Coldest climate conditions are recorded during the last glacial maximum and the last deglaciation. Warming occurred in the Early Holocene and warmest summer temperature conditions and the Holocene thermal maximum (HTM) occurred in the interval roughly between 9000 and 7200 cal yr BP, concurrent with summer insolation maxima. Rapid cooling of-1.5 degrees C occurred after the warmest maximum and between-7200 and 6500 cal yr BP, and temperatures stabilized between-6500 and 3000 cal yr BP. A further cooling began-3000 cal yr BP and culminated with coldest summer conditions during the Dark Ages (DA) and Little Ice Age (LIA) at-1550 cal yr BP (-400 CE) and-200 cal yr BP (-1750 CE), respectively. This cooling temperature trend was interrupted by warmer conditions during the Iberian-Roman Humid Period (IRHP)-2000 cal yr BP and during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) at-1000 cal yr BP. Our reconstruction shows a greater than two-degree cooling during the Middle and Late Holocene, agreeing with global mean surface temperature (GMST) reconstructions. Modern climate warming (MCW) during summer exceeds the two-degree Celsius forecasted for the future due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases, suggesting that recent warming is amplified at high elevations. Alpine environments and the biodiversity contained there are thus in danger if the observed temperature trend continues in the next decades.

J	Romanów, M; Witek, Z				Romanow, Malgorzata; Witek, Zbigniew			Periphyton dry mass, ash content, and chlorophyll content on natural substrata in three water bodies of different trophy	OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES												Periphyton communities were studied on several dominating macrophytes, Phragmites australis, Potamogeton lucens, and Nuphar lutea, in three different types of lakes. In soft-water mesotrophic Lake Maly Borek and in shallow, eutrophic Lake Gardno samples were collected about once every two months from April to November 2009. In eutrophic Szczecin Lagoon (the estuary of the Oder River), samples were only collected once in July. The aim of this paper was to determine the dry mass, the ash content, and the chlorophyll-a content of periphyton on a natural substratum, in order to determine the mass, the inorganic-organic status of periphyton, and the auto-heterotrophic character of this complex. The analyzed periphytic communities exhibited low dry mass at the beginning of the growth season, which increased with colonization period on the aquatic vegetation. The highest (but still low) values were achieved in autumn, which persisted, with small loss, until spring of the subsequent year. The differences in dry mass between each type of lake were small, but in the strongly eutrophic Szczecin Lagoon this index was slightly higher than in the other two water bodies. The highest dry mass was noted for periphyton dominated by Cordylophora caspia colonies overgrowing common reeds and for periphyton on Potamogeton lucens in Szczecin Lagoon. In shallow water bodies, such as Lake Gardno and Szczecin Lagoon, wind causes strong resuspension of sediments. This can explain the relatively high level of inorganic matter in dry mass of the periphyton in both water bodies. However, the small ash content in periphyton in Maly Borek may result from the soft-water character of this lake. The hetero-autotrophic status of the periphytic community prevailed throughout the study period in Gardno and Maly Borek lakes. The auto-heterotrophic status of periphyton was noted only in short periods of time in each lake.																			1730-413X	1897-3191				DEC	2011	40	4					64	70		10.2478/s13545-011-0042-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s13545-011-0042-3													WOS:000298502100008

The abundance of evaporite rocks (gypsum, anhydrite and halite) and their high solubility contribute to the development of exokarstic features (dolines, uvalas, sinkholes). Grande and Chica lakes arc dolines located in the western border of the diapir that are intersected by the piezometric level. Close to the first wetland is the Aguileras spring, which is the main discharge point of the west sector of the system. To assess the wetland-spring relation and the general functioning of the system, the geomorphologic framework has been analyzed and hydrogeological controls have been performed, consisting in liinnimetric and discharge logging and in situ measurements of physico-chemical parameters (EC and water temperature). Furthermore, spring, wetland and rain water samples have been taken for subsequent chemical and isotopic analysis. Preliminary results show that wetland water level and spring discharge follow a similar trend, consistently with the inertia of the system. However, their hydrochemical evolution and isotopic values differ, thus wetland-groundwater interaction has not been fully determined. Nevertheless, present research suggests that the hydrogeological connection would be more likely during wet periods, when the water table is at higher altitude.					; Gil-Márquez, José/AAJ-5550-2020; Linares, Luis/MTA-6828-2025; Benavente, Jose/A-7325-2013	Matias, Mudarra/0000-0002-5045-6191; Gil-Marquez, Jose Manuel/0000-0002-6318-6231; ANDREO, BARTOLOME/0000-0002-3769-7329; 													0583-6050	1580-2612					2016	45	2					147	160																WOS:000389765000005

While both the monoecious and dioecious biotypes are present in the United States, monoecious populations have continued to spread along the eastern seaboard and in the Great Lakes Region. There is limited documentation of this biotype's response to herbicides; therefore, we conducted two laboratory studies to compare the efficacy of endothall against monoecious and dioecious hydrilla under various concentrations and exposure times. In the first experiment, plants were propagated from shoot fragments. In the second experiment, plants were propagated from subterranean turions (tubers). Results showed that endothall is efficacious against both monoecious and dioecious hydrilla, reducing biomass by >85% with concentrations of 2 mg ai L(-1) coupled with exposure times of 48 h for dioecious and 72 h for monoecious plants grown from shoot fragments. Higher concentrations (4 mg ai L(-1)) or extended exposure times (96 h) were required to control hydrilla grown from tubers. Treatment of newly sprouted monoecious tubers may be an effective application strategy because most monoecious tubers sprout during spring and summer. Endothall efficacy against monoecious and dioecious hydrilla grown from tubers requires further study.																			0146-6623					JAN	2010	48						15	20																WOS:000290834900004

However, little is known about green-house gas dynamics in freshwater experiencing frequent algal blooms. Therefore, to explore the spatial and temporal variations in methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), seasonal field investigations were performed in the Northwest Bay of Lake Chaohu (China), where there are frequent algal blooms. From the highest site in the nearshore to the pelagic zones, the CH4 concentration in water decreased by at least 80%, and this dynamic was most obvious in warm seasons when algal blooms occurred. CH4 was 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than the saturated concentration, with the highest in spring, which makes this bay a constant source of CH4. However, unlike CH4, CO2 did not change substantially, and river mouths acted as hotspots for CO2 in most situations. The highest CO2 concentration appeared in winter and was saturated, whereas at other times, CO2 was unsaturated and acted as a sink. The intensive photosynthesis of rich algae decreased the CO2 in the water and increased dissolved oxygen and pH. The increase in CH4 in the bay was attributed to the mineralization of autochthonous organic carbon. These findings suggest that frequent algal blooms will greatly absorb more CO2 from atmosphere and increasingly release CH4, therefore, the contribution of the bay to the lake's CH4 emissions and carbon budget will be major even though it is small. The results of this study will be the same to other shallow lakes with frequent algal bloom, making lakes a more important part of the carbon budget and greenhouse gases emission.					; Liu, Cheng/AAC-5395-2020	Zhang, Lei/0000-0002-4376-0320; wang, tong/0009-0004-9101-4973; Liu, Cheng/0000-0002-3526-7026													0269-7491	1873-6424				NOV 1	2022	312								120061	10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120061	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120061		SEP 2022						36041568					WOS:000862854900006

Western U.S. lake expansions during Heinrich stadials linked to Pacific Hadley circulation	SCIENCE ADVANCES												Lake and cave records show that winter precipitation in the southwestern United States increased substantially during millennial-scale periods of Northern Hemisphere winter cooling known as Heinrich stadials. However, previous work has not produced a clear picture of the atmospheric circulation changes driving these precipitation increases. Here, we combine data with model simulations to show that maximum winter precipitation anomalies were related to an intensified subtropical jet and a deepened, southeastward-shifted Aleutian Low, which together increased atmospheric river-like transport of subtropical moisture into the western United States. The jet and Aleutian Low changes are tied to the southward displacement of the intertropical convergence zone and the accompanying intensification of the Hadley circulation in the central Pacific. These results refine our understanding of atmospheric changes accompanying Heinrich stadials and highlight the need for accurate representations of tropical-extratropical teleconnections in simulations of past and future precipitation changes in the region.					; Galbraith, Eric/F-9469-2014; Moreno-Chamarro, Eduardo/ABF-9676-2021	Marshall, John/0000-0001-9230-3591; Moreno-Chamarro, Eduardo/0000-0002-7931-5149; Galbraith, Eric/0000-0003-4476-4232; McGee, David/0000-0002-7329-3428; 													2375-2548					NOV	2018	4	11							eaav0118	10.1126/sciadv.aav0118	http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aav0118								30498784					WOS:000452212000075

Andy			Assessing scalar concentration footprint climatology and land surface impacts on tall-tower CO2 concentration measurements in the boreal forest of central Saskatchewan, Canada	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Reducing the large uncertainties in current estimates of CO2 sources and sinks at regional scales (10(2)-10(5) km(2)) is fundamental to improving our understanding of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Continuous high-precision CO2 concentration measurements on a tower within the planetary boundary layer contain information on regional carbon fluxes; however, its spatial representativeness is generally unknown. In this study, we developed a footprint model (Simple Analytical Footprint model based on Eulerian coordinates for scalar Concentration [SAFE-C]) and applied it to two CO2 concentration towers in central Canada: the East Trout Lake 106-m-tall tower (54A degrees 21'N, 104A degrees 59'W) and the Candle Lake 28-m-high tower (53A degrees 59'N, 105A degrees 07'W). Results show that the ETL tower's annual concentration footprints were around 10(3)-10(5) km(2). The monthly footprint climatologies in summer were 1.5-2 times larger than in winter. The impacts of land surface carbon flux associated with heterogeneous distribution of vegetation types on the CO2 concentration measurements were different for the different heights, varied with a range of +/- 5 % to +/- 10 % among four heights. This study indicates that concentration footprint climatology analysis is important in interpreting the seasonal, annual and inter-annual variations of tower measured CO2 concentration data and is essential for comparing and scaling regional carbon flux estimates using top-down or bottom-up approaches.

Spatial disconnection of plankton dynamics in an Ozark reservoir	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												This two-year study examined spatial distribution and seasonal population dynamics of algae and zooplankton in Table Rock Lake ( Missouri, USA), a large clear reservoir threatened by increased development in the watershed. Regular samples were collected from a polymictic up-lake site (10 m deep, mean Secchi transparency 1.0 m) and a monomictic down-lake site (37 m deep, 4.0 m Secchi) in the productive James River arm. Average abundance and biovolume of most algae groups showed no statistically-discernable difference between these two sites, and maximum cell densities were similar in magnitude (similar to 10(5) cells/mL). Exceptional were the chlorophytes, which had their highest abundance up-lake. Based on taxonomic composition, both sites appear to be dominated by pelagic algae, with little evidence of riverine immigrants. Algae and zooplankton showed rapid seasonal changes in total densities and composition, and peak abundances showed no association in time between the two sites. Although no floating or suspended colonies were ever visible in the field, cyanobacteria (particularly Oscillatoria) were common at both study sites, and we found numerous genera linked to nuisance blooms in other lakes. Zooplankton communities differed between sites, with cladocerans common in winter and spring at the down-lake site and rotifers common year round at the up-lake site. Important cladoceran grazers, such as Daphnia, were usually not abundant; however, when they were common, algae abundance was always low.																			1040-2381						2009	25	1					28	38		10.1080/07438140802714320	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140802714320													WOS:000269667100003
J	COWELL, BC; DAWES, CJ				COWELL, BC; DAWES, CJ			NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT EXPERIMENTS IN 3 CENTRAL FLORIDA LAKES OF DIFFERENT TROPHIC STATES	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Seasonal nutrient enrichment experiments (short-term bioassays) were conducted in three Florida lakes of different trophic states to determine the effects of addition of various nutrient combinations upon chlorophyll a and phytoplankton standing crops. Nutrient enriched surface water samples with crustacean zooplankton removed were incubated in situ in clear polyethylene bags for 3 to 6 days. The 2(5) factorial design employed two levels (ambient and enriched) of each of five nutrients [NH4+, PO43-, Fe2--EDTA, SiO32- and a cation (Ca2+ or K+) or trace elements]. Ammonium produced significant increases in chlorophyll a and phytoplankton standing crops in all experiments. Phosphate produced similar results in the mesotrophic lake, but the eutrophic lakes had both positive and nonsignificant responses which varied seasonally between lakes. Iron increased chlorophyll a in most experiments but affected total phytoplankton standing crop only during the summer and fall. Silicon had negative effects in some experiments. Cations and trace elements produced marked differences between lakes for chlorophyll a, but total phytoplankton standing crop showed few significant responses. Synergistic responses to two- and three-factor interactions were observed in all lakes. Differences in the responses of phytoplankton taxonomic divisions to enrichment may be responsible for much of the between lake variation in chlorophyll a and total phytoplankton volume responses. Nutrient limitations in these lakes are discussed and related to limnological factors and predictive models.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG 15	1991	220	3					217	231		10.1007/BF00006578	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006578													WOS:A1991GK31000005

Seasonal variation in the major ion chemistry of Pandoh Lake, Mandi District, Himachal Pradesh, India	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY					15th Annual V M Goldschmidt Conference	MAY, 2005	Moscow, ID					Pandoh is a beautiful Lake surrounded by Shivalik sequences (Lesser Himalaya) in the Mandi District of Himachal Pradesh. A comprehensive and systematic study on the seasonal pattern of major ions (Cl-, PO43-, HCO3-, NO3-, SO42-, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+) and SiO2 was carried out to understand the geochemical processes controlling water quality. There is marked seasonal variation for almost all ions. Carbonate weathering and atmospheric precipitation are strong factors controlling the chemistry of major ion such as Ca2+, Mg2+ and HCO3- in the winter and summer seasons. In the monsoon season, relatively low concentrations of all the ions were observed due to dilution effects. Ca2+, Mg2+ and HCO3- generally account for about 70% of the total ions throughout the year. The ratios Ca2+ + Mg2+/Na+ + Cl-, HCO3- /(Ca2+ + Mg2+), (Ca2+ + Mg2+)/T-2(+), (Na+ + K+)/T-z(+) indicate that carbonate weathering is the main control on water chemistry in conz z trast to other Himalayan lakes. The low concentrations of Na+ and K+ indicate a minimal contribution from the weathering of silicate minerals to Pandoh Lake. Correlation matrix and principal component analysis were used to identify various factors influencing the ionic strength of Pandoh Lake waters. The overall water quality variation (in space and time) as well as comparison with the quality of other Himalayan lake water indicates that this lake is non polluted, however there are indications of possible enrichment of nutrients (eutrophication) in the near future in the Himalayan region of the Indian subcontinent. Hence Pandoh Lake deserves further detailed attention for management of the water resource to preserve its eco-hydrological status. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The effect of latitudinal differences in the seasonal development of P. ambloplitis in southeastern Wisconsin compared with collections from elsewhere in North America are also noted. Enteric worms survived for up to 8 mo but lived and reproduced for longer periods in bowfin (Amia calva) in which reecruitment was only dependent on the ingestion of plerocercoid-infected fish intermediate hosts. In southeastern Wisconsin, bowfin appeared to be the important host in which the majority of the P. ambloplitis population circulates. The tapeworm''s initial establishment, maturation, and reproduction occurred in anterior most digestive tract locations in both bass and bowfin. Establishment of Haplobothrium globuliforme Cooper, 1914 occurs anteriorly in bowfin, but adult and gravid worms are found only in the large intestine during peak breeding in the summer. Adults live up to 1 yr in the gut of bowfin. The mud minnow (Umbra limi) is a new intermediate host for H. globuliforme plerocercoids. The 2 tapeworm species had considerably denser populations in the closed system of Silver Lake than in the larger river-connected Tichigan Lake. The seasonal development of both P. ambloplitis and H. globuliforme in bowfin is reported here for the first time. Notes on concurrent infections with acanthocephalans, other Proteocephalus species, and hyperparasitism are also included.																			1049-233X					JUL	1990	57	2					120	131																WOS:A1990DT06200005

California-Nevada [USA]. To estimate the influence of a watershed ecosystem on N input to the lake, samples of precipitation, soil water and stream water were collected and analyzed for NO3-N, NH4-N and, with less intensity, dissolved organic N. Factors controlling nitrification in selected plots were studied using a soil perfusion technique. Inorganic N input by precipitation to the watershed is 1-2 kg .cntdot. ha-1 .cntdot. yr-1. Output of inorganic N from the watershed to the lake is 10-33% of the precipitation input. Inorganic N is removed from snowmelt water almost completely by well-developed conifer stands, but less efficiently by poorly developed or disturbed stands. Alder stands release NO3-N to soil water especially in fall and early winter. Nitrification does occur in some coniferous forest soils in the watershed and is closely associated with NO3-N release. The occurrence of significant nitrification in the watershed is related more to the C:N ratio and stand basal area than to either pH or release of toxic substances by decaying litter.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1976	57	5					995	1004		10.2307/1941064	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1941064													WOS:A1976CN46200014
J	Arhonditsis, GB; Winder, M; Brett, MT; Schindler, DE				Arhonditsis, GB; Winder, M; Brett, MT; Schindler, DE			Patterns and mechanisms of phytoplankton variability in Lake Washington (USA)	WATER RESEARCH												Temporal variability in lake phytoplankton is controlled largely by a complex interplay between hydrodynamic and chemical factors, and food web interactions. We explored mechanisms underlying phytoplankton interannual variability in Lake Washington (USA), using a 25-yr time series of water quality data (1975-1999). Time-series analysis and PCA were used to decompose chlorophyll data into modes of variability. We found that phytoplankton dynamics in Lake Washington were characterized by four seasonal modes, each of which was associated with different ecological processes. The first mode coincided with the period when the system was light limited (January-March) and phytoplankton patterns were driven by the amount of available solar radiation. The second mode (April June) coincided with the peak of the spring bloom and the subsequent decline of phytoplankton biomass, and was largely controlled by total phosphorus levels and grazing pressure from cladoceran zooplankton. Evidence of co-dependence and tight relationship between phytoplankton and cladoceran dynamics were also found from July to October when a large portion of the phosphorus supply in the mixed layer was provided by zooplankton excretion. The fourth mode (November-December) was associated with the transition to thermal and chemical homogeneity and the winter phytoplankton minima (2 2.5 mug/l). Finally, we examined the effects of meteorological forcing and large-scale oceanic climate fluctuations (ENSO and PDO) on phytoplankton dynamics and assessed the significance of their role on the interannual variability in the lake.

Toxic algal blooms widely affect our use of water resources both with respect to drinking water and recreation. However, it is not only humans, but also organisms living in freshwater and marine ecosystems that may be affected by algal toxins. 2. In order to assess if cyanobacterial toxins affect the composition of natural zooplankton communities, we quantified the temporal fluctuations in microcystin concentration and zooplankton community composition in six lakes. 3. Microcystin concentrations generally showed a bimodal pattern with peaks in early summer and in autumn, and total zooplankton biomass was negatively correlated with microcystin concentrations. Separating the zooplankton assemblages into finer taxonomic groups revealed that high microcystin concentrations were negatively correlated with Daphnia and calanoid copepods, but positively correlated with small, relatively inefficient phytoplankton feeders, such as cyclopoid copepods, Bosmina and rotifers. 4. In a complementary, mechanistic laboratory experiment using the natural phytoplankton communities from the six lakes, we showed that changes in in situ levels of microcystin were coupled with reduced adult size and diminished juvenile biomass in Daphnia. 5. We argue that in eutrophic lakes, large unselective herbivores, such as Daphnia, are 'sandwiched' between high fish predation and toxic food (cyanobacteria). In combination, these two mechanisms may explain why the zooplankton community in eutrophic lakes generally comprise small forms (e.g. rotifers and Bosmina) and selective raptorial feeders, such as cyclopoid copepods, whereas large, unselective herbivores, such as Daphnia, are rare. Hence, this cyanobacterial chemical warfare against herbivores may add to our knowledge on population and community dynamics among zooplankton in eutrophic systems.					; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022; Rengefors, Karin/K-5873-2019	Rengefors, Karin/0000-0001-6297-9734; Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317													0046-5070	1365-2427				JUL	2007	52	7					1290	1301		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01765.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01765.x													WOS:000247127200010

Aerial surveys of primary river drainages were particularly useful in locating previously unidentified roost sites and aerial counts were highly correlated with ground counts of the same sites taken within eight days of each other. Despite an increase in monitoring effort and shifts in populations due to human disturbance, there were no significant differences detected in cormorant populations wintering in this region over the past four years. However, mid-February counts were significantly higher than either December or March counts and numbered approximately 30,000+/-2,000 individuals. Although up to 34 sites have been monitored to conduct these censuses, only between six and twelve sites were active (having >100 birds) at any one time. Although these are not always the same sites, six had a significantly higher frequency of occupancy than others, and lack of occupancy of these primary sites appeared to be associated with the occupancy of nearby alternative sites.																			0738-6028						1996	19	1					73	81		10.2307/1521809	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1521809													WOS:A1996VK49600008

However, in situ data in this region are extremely scarce and only a few lakes have gauge measurements. Satellite altimetry has been used successfully to monitor lake levels. In this study, Cryosat-2 SARIn mode data over the period 2010-2015 are used to investigate recent lake level variations. The estimated water levels of the 70 largest lakes (> 100 km(2)) on the TP show that 48 lakes reveal a rising trend (avg. 0.28 +/- 0.06 m/yr) while the other 22 show a slightly decreasing trend (avg. -0.10 +/- 0.04 m/yr). To compare with the change rates during 2003-2009, ICESat data which cover 42 of the 70 lakes are also used. When combining the data, the results show that during the period of 2003-2015, 28 lakes maintained a rising trend and the change rates are comparable. Lakes in the northern part of the TP experienced pronounced rising (avg. 0.37 +/- 0.10 m/yr), while lakes in southern part were steady or decreasing even in glaciated basins with high precipitation. Factor analysis indicates that driving factors for lake change are variable due to high spatial heterogeneity. However, autumn/winter temperature plays an important role in lake level change. These results demonstrate that lakes on the TP are still rapidly changing under climate change, especially in northern part of the TP, but the driving factors are variable and more research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind observed changes.

Close Link Between Harmful Cyanobacterial Dominance and Associated Bacterio planktonina Tropical Eutrophic Reservoir	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Cyanobacteria tend to become the dominant phytoplankton component in eutrophic freshwater environments during warmer seasons. However, general observations of cyanobacterial adaptive advantages in these circumstances are insufficient to explain the prevalence of one species over another in a bloom period, which may be related to particular strategies and interactions with other components of the plankton community. In this study, we present an integrative view of a mixed cyanobacterial bloom occurring during a warm, rainy period in a tropical hydropower reservoir. We used high-throughput sequencing to follow temporal shifts in the dominance of cyanobacterial genera and shifts in the associated heterotrophic bacteria community. The bloom occurred during late spring -summer and included two distinct periods. The first period corresponded to Microcystis aeruginosa complex (MAC) dominance with a contribution from Dolichospermum circinale; this pattern coincided with high water retention time and low transparency. The second period corresponded to Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and Synechococcus spp. dominance, and the reservoir presented lower water retention time and higher water transparency. The major bacterial phyla were primarily Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria, followed by Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Planctomycetes. Temporal shifts in the dominance of cyanobacterial genera were not only associated with physical features of the water but also with shifts in the associated heterotrophic bacteria. The MAC bloom was associated with a high abundance of Bacteroidetes, particularly Cytophagales. In the second bloom period, Planctomycetes increased in relative abundance, five Planctomycetes OTUs were positively correlated with Synechococcus or C. raciborskii OTUs. Our results suggest specific interactions of the main cyanobacterial genera with certain groups of the heterotrophic bacterial community. Thus, considering biotic interactions may lead to a better understanding of the shifts in cyanobacterial dominance.

Empirical evidence on the effects of climate on the viability of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) populations in European lakes	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Climate is a major driver of species distribution and biological invasions worldwide. In this study, we combined the catches of a widespread and invasive species, the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), with climate data to assess the importance of climate variables on the ability of the species to maintain self-sustaining populations in European lakes. Data were collected on common carp populations in 378 lakes in six European countries over a 16-year period (551 sampling campaigns). All catches followed the same standardized sampling procedure (European CEN gillnets). Climate data consisted of daily averages of air temperature and precipitation. Population self-sustainability was determined by the relative catches of different size classes and the presence of juveniles. The climate data were used to train a classification tree model to characterize the effects of climate on common carp population viability. Results indicated that climate is an important predictor of common carp population viability, which is particularly enhanced under dry conditions and elevated temperatures during spring and summer months. Areas of high population viability strongly overlapped with the invasive range of the species. According to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate projections, some areas where common carp currently have a low probability of maintaining viable populations will shift toward climatic conditions that enhance their viability and invasion potential.					; Ribeiro, Filipe/AER-1168-2022; Blabolil, Petr/K-9548-2015; Šmejkal, Marek/E-1269-2017; Souza, Allan/I-8799-2012; Jaric, Ivan/R-4048-2016; Kubecka, Jan/A-8230-2011; Ribeiro, Filipe/A-4949-2010; Smejkal, Marek/E-1269-2017	Ded, Vilem/0000-0001-9235-8496; VOLTA, Pietro/0000-0003-3177-0473; Blabolil, Petr/0000-0003-1344-9627; Souza, Allan/0000-0002-1851-681X; Jaric, Ivan/0000-0002-2185-297X; Kubecka, Jan/0000-0001-9203-4854; Ribeiro, Filipe/0000-0003-3531-5072; Smejkal, Marek/0000-0002-7887-6411													1387-3547	1573-1464				APR	2022	24	4					1213	1227		10.1007/s10530-021-02710-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-021-02710-5		JAN 2022											WOS:000743005600001
J	ELROD, JH				ELROD, JH			DISPERSAL OF 3 STRAINS OF HATCHERY-REARED LAKE TROUT IN LAKE-ONTARIO	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Rates of dispersal and resultant geographical distributions were determined for three strains of hatchery-reared lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) stocked at six sites in USA waters of Lake Ontario. The strains were Lake Superior (SUP); Clearwater Lake, Manitoba (CWL); and Seneca Lake, New York (SEN). The fish were recovered with bottom trawls fished during July and August 1980-1985 at 16 locations, extending from Toronto southward and eastward along the south shore to Dablon Point at the east and end of the the lake. Four SUP fish stocked as spring yearlings, the mean distances from stocking site to capture location 2, 14, and 26 months after stocking were 12, 57, and 62 km, respectively, for fish released at four south-shore sites and 5, 34, and 38 km for fish released at two eastern outlet basin sites. Rates of disperal for the CWL fish were similar to those of the SUP strain for fish stocked at the four south-shore sites, but were considerably less for fish stocked in the eastern outlet basin. The SEN strain was stocked only in the eastern outlet basin; their dispersal was similar to that of the SUP strain. For fish of the same age, SUP fish stocked as fall fingerlings became more widely dispersed than those stocked as spring yearlings. Movement of lake trout between the eastern outlet basin and the lake proper was limited. Large numbers of fish were captured on the Niagara Bar, but few moved past there into the west end of the lake. Movements of lake trout from stocking sites were generally with the prevailing currents. Differences between geographical distributions of the SUP and CWL strains were probably due to the influence of different current regimes at the depths they occupied. These results will be useful in selecting the best genetic strains of lake trout for rehabilitating the species in Lake Ontario, as well as for identifying the best stocking sizes and maximizing post-stocking survival of hatchery-reared fish.																			0380-1330						1987	13	2					157	167		10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71639-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71639-6													WOS:A1987J558000006

The surveyed fish were at 3.5-8 m depth, and fish density was significantly lower after seining than before. The seine catch was about 10 kg ha(-1), and the echosounding results showed a decrease of 7 kg ha(-1) in the hauling area. There were some difficulties due to the low temperature, and minor problems with steering and leakage of the shuttle. We conclude that it is possible to make mobile echosurveys under the ice and estimate densities of wintering fish. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Late-Quaternary summer temperature changes in the northern-European tree-line region	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												We present two new quantitative July mean temperature (T-jul) reconstructions from the Arctic tree-line region in the Kola Peninsula in north-western Russia. The reconstructions are based on fossil pollen records and cover the Younger Dryas stadial and the Holocene. The inferred temperatures are less reliable during the Younger Dryas because of the poorer fit between the fossil pollen samples and the modem samples in the calibration set than during the Holocene. The results suggest that the Younger Dryas T-jul in the region was 8.0-10.0 degrees C, being 2.0-3.0 degrees C lower than at present. The Holocene summer temperature maximum dates to 7500-6500 cat yr BP, with T-jul about 1.5 degrees C higher than at present. These new records contribute to our understanding of summer temperature changes along the northem-European tree-line region. The Holocene trends are consistent in most of the independent records from the Fennoscandian-Kola tree-line region, with the beginning of the Holocene thermal maximum no sooner than at about 8000 cat yr BR In the few existing temperature-related records farther east in the Russian Arctic tree line, the period of highest summer temperature begins already at about 10,000 cat yr BP. This difference may reflect the strong influence of the Atlantic coastal current on the atmospheric circulation pattern and the thermal behaviour of the tree-line region on the Atlantic seaboard, and the more direct influence of the summer solar insolation on summer temperature in the region east of the Kola Peninsula.

It is one of the most important wetlands in the world. It is also an important habitat for wintering cranes in China. Environmental factors play an important role in habitat selection of cranes of wetland ecosystem. In this paper, we analyzed land-use types and the four kinds of winter cranes in the Shengjin Lake from the years 1986 to 2015. Also, we adopted grey relational analysis and power function model to analyze the relevance between crane population and land-use types, and the main habitat types of cranes were obtained. We used principal component analysis method to analyze the main influence factor for habitat selection of crane. The results indicated that the main habitat type of four species of overwintering crane was reed-flat; the main factors affecting the habitat selection of cranes were water level, planktonic biomass, and distance to settlement. Among them, the weight of water level factor was the highest, which showed that water level was the most important factor affecting the habitat selection of cranes, followed by planktonic biomass, and the third was the weight of distance to settlement. The average values of them were 0.37m, 9.47mgL(-1), and 1.25km, respectively.

Large differences between carbon and nutrient loss rates along the land to ocean aquatic continuumimplications for energy:nutrient ratios at downstream sites	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The balance between the availability of energy and nutrients is decisive for the growth and survival of organisms. Here, we evaluated how energy, in this study expressed as total carbon (TC), is lost along the land to ocean aquatic continuum (LOAC) in relation to nutrients, i.e., total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), total iron (TFe), and dissolved silica (DSi). For the evaluation, we used data from 4774 lakes, 149 streams, and 52 river mouths from the boreal region. We found that the loss of all chemical variables followed a first order decay function along the LOAC with shortest half-lives for TFe and DSi (410 d and 568 d, respectively). The half-life of TC was more than twice as long as for TFe and DSi, resulting in rapidly increasing TC:TFe and TC:DSi ratios along the LOAC. In contrast, TC:TP and TC:TN ratios decreased along the LOAC. The TC and TFe concentration declines along the LOAC were quantitatively similar to the TC and TFe concentration declines from winter to summer, indicating that similar drivers are responsible for spatial and seasonal TC and TFe losses in inland waters. We conclude that the energy:nutrient ratio rapidly changes along the LOAC with an increasing surplus of energy in relation to TFe and DSi the longer water stays in the landscape. These findings have implications for the growth of aquatic organisms along the LOAC, where organisms are likely to become increasingly iron and silica limited with increasing water retention in the landscape.

The contribution of cold winter temperatures to the 2003 alewife population collapse in Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Lake Huron ecosystem has recently undergone dramatic changes. As part of those changes, the once highly abundant non-native alewife Alosa pseudoharengus population crashed in 2003 and has yet to recover. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether temperature played a role in the population crash, because historically alewife have been subject to die-off events in response to cold temperatures in other lakes. Long-term climate data (1973-2009) showed that the winter of 2002-2003 exhibited the largest drop in degree days relative to the previous year, had the most extensive average March ice coverage, and was among the coldest years on record. However, since 2003, winter temperatures have not been overly cold, and air temperature has shown an increasing trend. Also, the relationship between temperature and alewife abundance between 1975 and 2006 was non-significant. Therefore, although we found evidence that cold winter temperatures contributed to the abrupt decline of alewife in 2003, they could not explain why the population failed to recover as it had after previous cold winters. Historically, Chinook salmon abundance contributed to long-term trends in alewife abundance, however, we found predation by Chinook to play a lesser role on the 2003 alewife collapse. In the absence of direct estimates of food availability, analyses of alewife length data suggest that a declining prey base altered the ecosystem conditions for alewife, possibly contributing to their collapse and lack of recovery.

In an attempt to discern long-term regional patterns in phytoplankton community composition we analysed data from five deep peri-alpine lake basins that have been included in long-term monitoring programmes since the beginning of the 1970s. Local management measures have led to synchronous declines in phosphorus concentrations by more than 50% in all four lakes. Their trophic state now ranges from mesotrophic to oligotrophic. 2. No coherence in phytoplankton biomass was observed among lakes, or any significant decrease in response to phosphorus (P)-reduction (oligotrophication), except in Lakes Constance and Walen. 3. Multivariate analyses identified long-term changes in phytoplankton composition, which occurred coherently in all lakes despite the differing absolute phosphorus concentrations. 4. In all lakes, the phytoplankton species benefiting from oligotrophication included mixotrophic species and/or species indicative of oligo-mesotrophic conditions. 5. A major change in community composition occurred in all lakes at the end of the 1980s. During this period there was also a major shift in climatic conditions during winter and early spring, suggesting an impact of climatic factors. 6. Our results provide evidence that synchronous long-term changes in geographically separated phytoplankton communities may occur even when overall biomass changes are not synchronous.

The geo-accumulation index (Igeo) categorizes metals as extremely polluted during monsoon and heavily contaminated to extremely contaminated during summer. The enrichment factor (EF) of metals Mn during monsoon and Cd during summer indicates extremely severe enrichment (EF > 50) and Mo exhibited very high contamination (CF > 6) throughout the basin during monsoon. The average risk index of heavy metal in the basin followed the order Cd (164.15) > Ni (14.82) > Co (4.84) > Cr (2.55) > Cu (1.89) > Zn (1.38) > Mn (0.40) during monsoon and Cd (153.07) > Ni (7.96) > Cu (5.13) > Co (4.63) > Cr (1.89) > Zn (1.21) > Mn (0.3) during summer showing that the PERI of each element was minimal except for Cd. Adverse health-related effects are confirmed by the cumulative total hazard index (THI) for children with HQ ingestion and HI values >1 in all sample locations over both seasons. Principal component and cluster analysis show metals accumulate in sediments mainly through industrial wastewater discharge and also experience significant natural source weathering through rainfall runoff. This research emphasizes the need for enhanced wastewater treatment facilities in metropolitan areas situated along the Noyyal River to potentially reduce the release of heavy metals from both domestic and industrial sources.					; Crispin, Augustine/KIA-5176-2024; , purushothaman/ACS-7864-2022	Crispin, Augustine/0009-0003-6750-0739; 													1532-0383	1549-7887				NOV 16	2024	33	8					1696	1716		10.1080/15320383.2024.2390542	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15320383.2024.2390542		AUG 2024											WOS:001290018400001

Estimates of adult Lake Trout mortality from coded wire tags in a population with developing natural reproduction in southern Lake Michigan	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Objective: Overfishing and Sea Lamprey Petromyzon marinus predation led to extirpation of Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush from Lake Michigan in the 1950s. Large populations of hatchery-reared fish were developed by the 1970s, but natural reproduction was limited until the early 2000s when it began to increase in the southern main basin. Hypothesizing that the relatively low mortality of spawning-aged fish contributed to this reproductive success, we estimated the total annual mortality rate for this population. Methods: We used catch curves to estimate the total instantaneous mortality rate Z using coded wire tags, which provided definitive ages. We made separate estimates from fish collected in three on-going surveys: a spring gill-net survey, a fall gill-net spawning survey, and a sport fishery survey. Result: Our estimates of Z +/- SE were 0.297 +/- 0.019, 0.239 +/- 0.009, and 0.205 +/- 0.007 for the spring, spawning, and sport fishery surveys, respectively. We suggest that the mean Z +/- SE of all survey estimates of 0.247 +/- 0.027 would be a reasonable estimate for this population, which equates to a total annual mortality of 22 +/- 3%. This estimate is in the low range of rates reported for the species and is in the same range as other populations in the Great Lakes with well-established natural reproduction. Conclusion: We concluded that these low total mortality rates contributed to the reproductive success in southern Lake Michigan through increasing spawning stock density and age structure and that previous estimates of another important population parameter, the instantaneous natural mortality rate M, were too high. Estimates of M ranged from 0.210 to 0.240 and were based on the Pauly equation, a growth- and temperature-based estimator. We suggest maximum-age-based estimators of M are more appropriate for Lake Trout. Several alternative maximum-age-based estimators produced estimates for M of 0.132-0.058, all of which are more compatible with our estimate of Z.

What drives benthic macroinvertebrate dispersal in different lake substrata? The case of three Mediterranean lakes	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Benthic macroinvertebrate communities from different lake zones are known to respond differently to environmental parameters and human pressures. The objectives of this study were to explore the spatial and temporal variability of benthic communities, investigate the effect of environmental factors on their assemblages and assess their response to eutrophication in the profundal and sublittoral zones of three Greek eutrophic lakes (Volvi, Kastoria and Mikri Prespa). These lakes are subjected to different land uses in their catchment areas. Samplings were conducted bi-annually (spring and autumn). Sixteen taxa were collected in the sublittoral and eleven in the profundal zone of the studied lakes. Among them, some species were recorded for the first time in the studied lakes. The dominant species were Potamothrix hammoniensis (Michaelsen, 1901) (Oligochaeta), Chaoborus (Chaoborus) flavicans (Meigen, 1830) and Chironomus (Chironomus) gr. plumosus Linnaeus, 1758 (Diptera), reflecting the eutrophic status of these waterbodies. Benthic communities, their functional traits (microhabitat preferences and feeding types), diversity and rarity species differed among lakes. Especially Lake Prespa, as a potentially ancient lake, hosts an endemic oligochaete community. Altitude and eutrophication (expressed as P-PO4 and BOD5 concentrations) were the main environmental factors explaining spatial and temporal variability in the assemblages. Based on the Greek Lake Benthic invertebrate Index, the ecological quality of the studied lakes was estimated as good to moderate. Benthic macroinvertebrates from both lake zones are associated with eutrophication, which is related to anthropogenic activities.

J	Binelli, A; Ricciardi, F; Provini, A				Binelli, A; Ricciardi, F; Provini, A			Present status of POP contamination in Lake Maggiore (Italy)	CHEMOSPHERE												In the last decade, Lake Maggiore has been subject to heavy DDT contamination due to a chemical plant located near the main influent of the Baveno Bay. The freshwater bivalve zebra mussel (D. polymorpha) was used as a bioindicator of several POPs (DDTs, PCBs, HCB, HCHs) to follow their concentration trend after a heavy flood in autumn 2000. Sampling of mollusc specimens were carried out monthly from April 2001 to October 2002 at two different stations in and outside the bay. Results showed worsening of DDT pollution due to the transport of insecticide from contaminated sediments and soils still present in the closed chemical plant site. Levels of about 4.5 mug/g lipids in soft tissues of specimens from the most contaminated site and 2.0 mug/g lipids outside it were found, which are twice those measured before the flood. HCHs and HCB values were always very low, but it was noticed since winter 2001-2002 a sharp increase of PCB pollution, with values of about 3-4 mug/g lipids, not due to the 2000 flood, but probably to improper discharge or release of contaminated sediments from numerous dams located in the watershed. Concentrations of total dioxin-like PCBs reached dangerous levels for the water community. Fish consumption may be a risk for human health especially for resident population, bearing in mind that fish usually have a higher POP concentration than zebra mussel. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the dynamics of viruses and host associations throughout the seasons and during blooming periods in eutrophic freshwater ecosystems remain poorly understood. From the water microbiomes of planktonic biomass from Lake Taihu, a large eutrophic freshwater lake in China that experiences annual Microcystisdominated harmful algal blooms (HABs), we recovered 41,997 unique viral clusters spanning a wide taxonomic range, including 15,139 Caudovirales clusters targeting bacteria and 1,044 NCLDV clusters targeting eukaryotes. The viral community exhibited clear seasonal succession, driven primarily by microbial communities (particularly Cyanobacteria and Planctomycetes) and environmental factors (mainly nutrients and temperature). Host prediction revealed that viral infection had a more distinct impact on bacteria-driven nitrogen pathways than on phosphate cycling. HAB-induced variations in microbial composition and environmental conditions affected viral strategies including viral lifestyles, host range, and virus-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (vAMGs) distributions. Viruses infecting Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria showed an enhanced lysogenic lifestyle and a narrower host range during HAB peak in summer, while viruses infecting Bacteroidota adopted an opposite strategy. Notably, vAMGs were most abundant before the HAB outbreak in spring, compensating for bacterial metabolic processes of their hosts such as carbohydrates metabolism, photosynthesis, and phosphate regulation. The findings highlight the intricate relationships between viruses, host microbes, and the bloom-associated environment, underscoring the important biochemical roles viruses play in eutrophic freshwater ecosystems.					; Yu, Pingfeng/AAC-1411-2020; Zhao, Ze/AAA-3206-2020; Chen, LinXing/CAI-1236-2022; JU, Feng/I-8437-2016; Huang, Xinyu/IWV-1170-2023	Zhao, Ze/0000-0003-4420-4681; 													0160-4120	1873-6750				NOV	2024	193								109125	10.1016/j.envint.2024.109125	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2024.109125		NOV 2024						39547087					WOS:001358623100001

The main focus of this study was on the use of scintillometry to determine the turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat. A novel approach is utilized for identifying periods where the scintillometry measurement footprint extends beyond the water surface. This approach relies on comparison of 'inferred' water surface temperature and measured skin temperature. The 'inferred' temperature is an independent assessment of water skin temperature derived through rearrangement of key equations in the scintillometry calculation scheme. An extensive dataset is used to investigate the processes controlling heat and vapour fluxes and to develop simple relationships that can be used for reliable predictions. These relationships are used to fill missing measurements in the dataset and to construct a complete energy balance for an 18 month period. The long-term data set is used to describe the diurnal, seasonal and annual variations in energy fluxes and to explore issues related to energy balance closure. Average energy balance closure across the study was 82%, however closure was much better during the winter than the summer. The key factors likely to lead to errors in energy balance closure are considered and it is concluded that the most likely causes are underestimation of latent heat fluxes, advection of energy that is not measured by the scintillometer, or overestimation of net radiation.

The amounts of fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) and perfluorinated sulfonamido alcohols (FOSEs) sequestered in the samplers increased with altitude, being lowest at an elevation of 1300 In asl and highest at either the 2340 or the 2740 m asl sites. A variety of potential reasons for these gradients are discussed, including changes in sampler uptake kinetics and phase capacity caused by changes in atmospheric pressure, temperature, and wind speed. Vapor phase concentrations were estimated to range from 3.7 to 19 pg m(-3) for perfluorinated sulfonamides (FOSAs) and from below detection limits (25 pg m(-3)) to 88 pg In 3 for FOSEs. Over a similar altitudinal range (800-2350 m asl), 9 L lake water samples were collected in stainless steel cans, extracted with solid phase extraction columns, and analyzed for PFCAs and PFOS. Aqueous concentrations in lake water, ranging from 0.07 to 1.0 ng L-1 for single PFCAs and from 0.04 to 0.1 ng L-1 for PFOS, were more constant with altitude and were not correlated with the amount of the precursor compounds in the atmosphere. The relative abundance of FTOHs in air and PFCAs in water supports atmospheric FTOH degradation as the source of PFCAs in the mountain lakes.

Changes in runoff chemistry and soil fertility after multiple years of cattle winter bale feeding on annual cropland on the Canadian prairies	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Feeding cattle on cropland through the winter months using pre-placed fodder bales (bale grazing or infield bale feeding) has demonstrated economic benefits when compared to confined winter feeding, but very little research has been done to quantify the impacts of recurring cycles of in-field feeding on runoff water quality. In this study, two small watersheds (with and without winter bale grazing; WBG) located in the same annual cropped field in southern Manitoba, Canada were monitored from 2008 to 2016. Winter feeding in the WBG treatment occurred in the winters of 2008/09, 2010/11, 2012/13, and 2014/15. Export of N and P with the WBG treatment was also contrasted with the alternative practice of higher density confined feeding (CF). For WBG, soil fertility was improved, with higher soil test phosphorus (Olsen-P) and soil nitrate (NO3(-)-N) following WBG. Exports of N and P with surface runoff were also higher in snowmelt following WBG when compared to the control watershed, primarily due to higher concentrations of particulate N and P, NH4+-N, and dissolved organic N. Higher P loss from the WBG watershed than from the control watershed persisted in the non-grazing years following each bale grazing. In contrast, concentrations of all forms of nitrogen in runoff consistently returned to levels observed prior to bale grazing following a winter without treatment. Annual runoff export of N and P per animal unit day (AUD) following WBG was comparable to that for two CF sites. Higher annual volumes of runoff were observed from the larger area and lower density bale feeding treatment, but with lower concentrations of N and Pin comparison to feedlot sites. If WBG continues to be utilized to improve soil fertility and reduce manure transportation costs, the potential negative impacts on runoff water quality must be considered. Higher volumes of snowmelt runoff per AUD from WBG in comparison to CF sites will make runoff capture options more expensive to implement. WBG timing or siting changes that reduce runoff volume and make retention feasible or that decrease accumulation of P at the soil surface will reduce negative water quality impacts associated with WBG.

J	Derting, TL				Derting, TL			Changes in gastrointestinal characteristics of an omnivorous species, the raccoon, with lactation and season	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												I investigated changes in the capacity of the alimentary canal in a moderately small, omnivorous mammal, the raccoon (Procyon lotor). Because of their diverse diet, omnivores may not be dependent upon changes in capacity of the alimentary canal to meet increased energy needs, as are strict herbivores and ruminants. I hypothesized that the capacity of the alimentary canal of lactating and nonreproductive female raccoons would not differ significantly. I also hypothesized that capacity would not differ between summer and winter. Raccoons were captured at Land-Between-the-Lakes, Kentucky. The wet and dry masses, length, and volume of the total gastrointestinal tract and individual organs of the alimentary canal were measured. Results showed that capacity can increase in an omnivorous species in the field. Lactating females had significantly greater wet or dry masses of the total gastrointestinal tract, stomach, and colon than did nonreproductive females. The lengths and volumes of the organs of the alimentary canal also were larger, although not to a significant extent, in lactating females. No significant effect of season occurred on total capacity of the alimentary canal or the capacity of any associated organ. My findings support the contention that change in capacity of the alimentary canal is a fundamental physiological response of mammals to sustained periods of increased demand for energy.

J	Drewien, RC; Clegg, KR; Shea, RE				Drewien, RC; Clegg, KR; Shea, RE			Capturing trumpeter swans by night-lighting	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												We captured trumpeter swans (Cygnus buccinator) from the Rocky Mountain population during the winters of 1990-96 at Harriman State Park on the Henrys Fork of the Snake River, Idaho, and during winter 1990 at Red Rock Lakes National Wildlife Refuge, Montana. Captured swans were translocated as part of efforts to restore use of other wintering areas and reduce population vulnerability. In 1990, we tested several capture techniques in severe winter conditions and found night-lighting to be most effective. During 1990-96, we captured 1,117 trumpeter swans by night-lighting, including 1,070 from boats and 47 from snowmobiles and an all-terrain vehicle (ATV). Mean catch/night was 15.1 swans during 71 nights from boats and 4.7 swans during 10 nights from snowmobiles and the ATV. Capture success varied with number of swans present, their prior exposure to night-lighting, and weather conditions, with higher catches in fog ((x) over bar = 19.0) and snowstorms ((x) over bar = 17.1), and lower catches on overcast ((x) over bar = 8.7) and clear nights ((x) over bar = 4.0). A small, lightweight (180-kg) airboat with a reinforced hull and modified to operate in severe winter weather proved indispensable to capture large numbers of trumpeter swans. Most capture attempts occurred during inclement weather when temperatures ranged from 0 degrees to -30 degrees C and required appropriate safety precautions.																			1938-5463					SPR	1999	27	1					209	215																WOS:000081736800032

Lake Moreno Oeste is a deep warm monomictic lake (Z(max) = 90 m), while Lake Morenito is shallower (Z(max)= 12 m) and polymictic. Sampling was performed in a mid-lake station, where vertical profiles of temperature, light, and chlorophyll a concentration were measured in situ. In addition, DOC and phosphorus concentrations were determined, and samples for bacteria, phytoplankton and ciliate enumeration were taken along the water columns. Lake Morenito presented DOC and phosphorus concentrations 3-fold higher than those of Lake Moreno Oeste. Two different ciliate assemblages were present. Lake Moreno Oeste was dominated by the large mixotrophic ciliate Ophrydium naumanni, which was absent in Lake Morenito. In order to test O. naumanni water dependence, a series of laboratory experiments were performed during the sampling season. The experiments consisted of the incubation of the ciliate in filtered water from both lakes and the subsequent analysis of growth rates in each treatment. In addition, experiments with Moreno Oeste lake water with a 4-fold increased phosphorus concentration (addition of MBL culture medium) were conducted. The incubation of O. naumanni in Lake Morenito water led to highly negative growth rates of the ciliate. Results showed that the addition of nutrients did not cause significant differences in the growth rates.					; Balseiro, Esteban/Y-2743-2019	Balseiro, Esteban/0000-0002-5052-0587; Modenutti, Beatriz/0000-0002-8683-5679; 													0948-3055	1616-1564				JUN 15	2000	21	3					299	307		10.3354/ame021299	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame021299													WOS:000087813000009
B	Humphries, MO; Maker, J		Humphries, MO; Marker, J		Humphries, Mark Osborne; Maker, John			THE QUESTION OF THE WAR'S CENTRE OF GRAVITY IN JANUARY	GERMANYS WESTERN FRONT: TRANSLATIONS FROM THE GERMAN OFFICIAL HISTORY OF THE GREAT WAR, VOL 2												AT THE BEGINNING OF 1915, THE WAR IN THE EAST WAS NOT GOING WELL FOR Germany or Austria-Hungary. Despite victories under Paul von Hindenburg and his Chief of Staff Erich Ludendorff at Tannenberg and the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes in August and September, the situation was far from stable. To the south, Count Conrad von Hotzendorf's Austro-Hungarian armies had failed to defeat the relatively small Serbian Army in the summer and autumn of 1914; indeed, they had been driven from the southeastern Balkans while Russian forces pressed deep into Austrian Galicia from the northwest. At the end of September the Russians laid siege to the fortress city of Przemysl; by year's end they had caused 1.25 million Austro-Hungarian casualties.(1) Austria-Hungary was threatened with collapse. Conrad told Austrian Foreign Minister Leopold von Berchtold that unless drastic action was taken, the Dual Monarchy "could no longer master the military situation."(2) The failures of 1914 and Austria-Hungary's weakness had significant political as well as strategic consequences for Germany. An undefeated Serbia meant that Germany remained separated from its Ottoman ally and thus cut off from the trade in weapons, food, and raw materials that was necessary to sustain them both. The Dual Monarchy's obvious vulnerability threatened to persuade the neutral Balkan powers (especially Bulgaria, Rumania, and Greece) to join the Entente. Italy, once a partner in the Triple Alliance but now neutral, also seemed to be making moves toward the enemy, which raised prospects of a third front in Southern Europe. In the West, Germany's offensives had also failed to secure a victory, but there the front was stabilizing, with trench warfare becoming the norm from Belfort near the Swiss border to Nieuport on the English Channel. Falkenhayn's attempts to capture the Channel Ports and then the city of Ypres with a late-autumn Flanders offensive resulted only in disappointment and heavy casualties. By new year, Germany was faced with a war on two European fronts, a struggling ally in the East, and an ominous political situation in the Balkans, all of which threatened to turn the war's tide against the Central Powers.																					978-1-55458-259-4				2010							3	19																WOS:000288537900003
J	Strong, WL				Strong, Wayne L.			Summer Climatic Moisture Balances for Yukon Xerophytic Grassland Slopes and Their Late-Wisconsinan Counterparts: Are Present-Day Grasslands Beringian Relicts?	ARCTIC												Summer climatic moisture balances (precipitation - potential evapotranspiration) for topographic slopes favored by present-day xerophytic boreal grasslands (SSW aspects with 61% - 65% gradients) in southwest Yukon were compared to their unglaciated late-Wisconsinan (14 000 - 12 000 cal yr BP) Beringian counterparts. The purpose was to determine whether present-day grasslands are ecologically plausible Beringian relicts or analogues. The Beringian climate was represented by meteorological stations with average July temperatures 4 degrees C colder than those of present-day grassland areas; all were from Arctic locations. The most commonly occupied grassland slopes received maximum local solar radiation and likely represented the warmest topographic positions in the landscape. Their summer evapotranspiration demands exceeded the 200 mm moisture supply by 189 mm. The same slopes had late-Wisconsinan summer moisture balances of -57 to -101 mm because of colder and shorter growing seasons. Moisture balances for late-Wisconsinan SSW slopes were similar to those of present-day WNW - NW aspects, which do not support grasslands. Differences in moisture deficits indicated present-day xerophytic grasslands were improbable Beringian in situ relicts or analogues. Alternatively, it was hypothesized that present-day Calamagrostis purpurascens communities developed during the Holocene Thermal Maximum (11 000 - 9000 cal yr BP), whereas Hesperostipa comata communities formed less than 3000 years ago after postglacial migration of the species from central North America.																			0004-0843	1923-1245				JUN	2018	71	2					139	148		10.14430/arctic4715	http://dx.doi.org/10.14430/arctic4715													WOS:000462920700003

Climate models predict that such conditions will intensify in the future, impacting millions of people. Paleo-climate studies can complement the short modern observational record and model projections by documenting climate changes in the past. Here we report major shifts in the geographic sources, intensity, and seasonality of Eastern Mediterranean precipitation during the unusually warm last interglacial period Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e, reflecting global shifts in the rain and desert belts, based on U-234/U-238-ratios , 238 U-ratios in mineral precipitates in the Dead Sea, combined with evidence from climate model simulations. In the Dead Sea catchment U-234/U-238 ratios are indicators of water sources, where the Jordan River (flowing from the north) and the western catchments show high activity ratios between similar to 1.5-1.7, and the eastern and southern catchments and flash floods (in the south-west, south and east) show lower ratios of 1.0-1.2. In Dead Sea water and precipitated minerals, U-234/U-238 is nearly always similar to 1.45-1.55 during both glacials and interglacials. However, during the last interglacial MIS 5e insolation peak (similar to 127 -122 ka) its value decreased to 1.2-1.3, and then to similar to 1.0 towards its end (similar to 122-116 ka). During the insolation peak, the U-isotope data, combined with climate model runs forced with period orbital and greenhouse gas concentrations, indicate that rainfall associated with the African Summer Monsoon in the Dead Sea catchment accounted for similar to 50% of the total annual rainfall, in stark contrast to present-day dry summers. The geochemical evidence indicates that following the insolation peak the region experienced an extremely dry period (although punctuated with wetter intervals), signifying expansion of the desert belt, similar to predicted effects of anthropogenic warming. This drying is partly supported by climate model runs forced with the appropriate changes in orbital parameters. The extreme drying during late MIS Se between similar to 122-116 ka reflected a major weakening of Mediterranean storm systems, resulting in a major decline of the Jordan River flow (indicated by the low U-234/U-238 ratios in the Dead Sea) and a relative increase in precipitation associated with the African Monsoon, shifting towards autumn. The Jordan River flow is estimated to be similar to 10% of the present-day (pre-1964, prior to major diversion of the Jordan River and its sources for human use). Such changes, if they occur in the future, have serious implications for future water availability in the politically sensitive Middle East. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Climate-related variations in mixing dynamics in an Alaskan arctic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Mean epilimnetic temperatures from mid-June through mid-August in a small, arctic kettle lake had no trend from 1975 to 2008 and varied annually up to +/-3 degrees C relative to the mean. Analysis of data from temperature arrays deployed on the lake from 1998 to 2007 showed that as mean summer temperatures shifted from 2.5 degrees C below the mean, to the mean, and to 3 degrees C above the mean, deepening of the mixed layer during cold fronts decreased, average metalimnetic thickness increased from 2 to 5 m, maximum values of water-column stability increased fourfold, minimum values of Lake numbers (L-N) increased from <= 1 to 10, the metalimnetic coefficient of eddy diffusivity (K-z) decreased from 10(-5) m(2) s(-1) to 10(-7) m(2) s(-1), and time scales for mixing across the metalimnion increased from days to months. Mean surface temperatures and mixing regimes were significantly correlated with mean air temperatures, but not with mean insolation, or mean wind speeds during summer. They also depended upon the frequency and persistence of events with higher winds, heating, or cooling. In summers with cold surface temperatures, the surface energy fluxes that induce mixing by heat loss were low but with frequent wind events heat was mixed downwards, leading to lower stability. The warmest surface temperatures resulted when atmospheric conditions led to persistent positive buoyancy flux in early summer and winds were elevated primarily on diel cycles as opposed to longer ones. Summers with cooler water temperatures and enhanced vertical mixing are linked to frontal activity and low atmospheric pressure near the northern Alaskan coast.

J	GRASTY, RL				GRASTY, RL			SUMMER OUTDOOR RADON VARIATIONS IN CANADA AND THEIR RELATION TO SOIL-MOISTURE	HEALTH PHYSICS												In the summers of 1990 and 1991, outdoor Rn-222 detectors were installed for 3 mo in 78 communities across Canada. The 1990 measurements showed large regional variations with the average outdoor levels for the provinces of Manitoba (59 Bq m(-3)) and Saskatchewan (61 Bq m(-3)) exceeding the average indoor levels of 55 Bq m(-3) for the U.S. The variations in the 1990 Rn-222 levels showed little correlation with the uranium concentration of the ground and were attributed to changes in soil moisture content. All measurements above 30 Bq m(-3) were found to be in dry climatic regions where the annual precipitation was less than 550 mm. In addition, most of the sites with high Rn-222 levels were on glacial lake clays. A soil moisture modeling program showed that because of the low precipitation, these clays were drying out in the summer allowing fractures to develop and Rn-222 to migrate easily through the ground. The much lower 1991 measurements for Manitoba (10 Bq m(-3)) and Saskatchewan (15 Bq m(-3)) were believed to be due to the increased precipitation in the prairie regions in the summer of 1991 compared to the unusually dry summer of 1990.																			0017-9078	1538-5159				FEB	1994	66	2					185	193		10.1097/00004032-199402000-00009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00004032-199402000-00009								8282560					WOS:A1994MT15200009

However, the degree to which forestry operations influence Hg in runoff varies among sites. A synoptic study, covering 54 catchments distributed all over Sweden, subjected to either stump harvest (SH), site preparation (SP) or no treatment (Ref), was undertaken to reveal the degree of forestry impact and causes of eventual variation. All streams were sampled twice, in autumn 2009 and summer 2010. There were no significant differences in total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations between the three treatments in either 2009 or 2010. However, when pooling the treated catchments (that is, SH and SP) and taking catchment properties such as latitude into account, the treatment had a significant influence on the THg and MeHg concentrations. Although the treatment effect on THg and MeHg did not differ between SH and SP, the study did reveal significant forestry effects on potassium (K) and total nitrogen (TN) that were greater in the SH catchments and lower in the SP catchments. Partial least square (PLS) regressions indicated that organic matter was the most important variable influencing both the THg and MeHg concentrations. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups when comparing the ratios of THg/total organic carbon (TOC) and MeHg/TOC, suggesting that the high concentrations of THg and MeHg observed at some of the treated catchments are associated with increased concentrations of TOC rather than new methylation or increased mobilization caused by factors other than TOC.

J	Loizeau, JL; Dominik, J				Loizeau, JL; Dominik, J			Evolution of the Upper Rhone River discharge and suspended sediment load during the last 80 years and some implications for Lake Geneva	AQUATIC SCIENCES												During this century, the characteristics of the Upper Rhone River discharge, flowing into Lake Geneva, have been altered in response to the changes which have occurred in its watershed. Principally, numerous hydroelectric dams have been constructed on the course of the Rhone River tributaries. At present the major reservoirs can hold about 1220 10(6) m(3) of water, which represents 1/5 of the total annual Rhone River flow. Flow regime characteristics of the river have been modified by the dam operations. Water is released from reservoirs during winter and stored in summer. Large floods have also been reduced in amplitude and frequency. From the available literature data, sediment rating curves have been calculated and used to estimate the evolution of the sediment load from the Rhone River to Lake Geneva. They show that sediment input has decreased by at least a factor 2. This reduction has impacted the occurrence of underflows along the lake bottom, due to the reduction of sediment-laden floods, which in turn may have considerable negative effects on the reoxygenation of Lake Geneva deep waters.					; Loizeau, Jean-Luc/AAA-1165-2022; Dominik, Janusz/G-3707-2018	Loizeau, Jean-Luc/0000-0002-0611-0388; 													1015-1621						2000	62	1					54	67		10.1007/s000270050075	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s000270050075													WOS:000087179300004

The Yangcheng Middle Lake with aquaculture area and the Yangcheng East Lake with important water intake are chosen to make a comparative investigation of the relationship between crab breeding and water quality. Phytoplankton community and the composition of dissolved organic matters (DOM) at different areas of the Yangcheng Lake are characterized with spectral fluorescence signatures. Results reveal that biopolymers and humic substances (HS) are the two major DOM compositions in the Yangcheng Lake. In the Yangcheng Middle Lake, the CODMn concentration at the large breeding area was lower than that in most other areas; while the concentration of algae and HS fluorescence intensity are positively correlated with each other in the Yangcheng Middle Lake. Crab breeding could accelerate nitrogen transformation and utilization. In summer and winter, the cumulative risk of building up potential harmful by-products such as DPBs caused by the biopolymers and HS is greater; the breeding of hairy crabs could reduce biopolymers and improve drinking water safety.

J	GOPHEN, M				GOPHEN, M			TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE OF FOOD-INTAKE, AMMONIA EXCRETION AND RESPIRATION IN CERIODAPHNIA-RETICULATA(JURINE)(LAKE KINNERET, ISRAEL)	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The abundance of C. reticulata in Lake Kinneret is restricted every year to the period March-June with a peak in May. The most constant parameter accompanying the peak is temperature with a range of 20-22.degree. C. An attempt was made to clarify whether the estival high average temperatures observed in the epilimnion of this lake (27-28.degree. C) could explain the decrease of the Ceriodaphnia population. Three physiological parameters, food intake, NH3 excretion and respiration rates, were measured experimentally at 3 temperatures (15.degree., 22.degree. and 27.degree. C). The dry weight of individuals of the winter and summer populations were measured, and the percentages of egg-bearing females in the populations were calculated. Temperature increase accelerated the rates of NH3 excretion and food ingestion. Acceleration was greater in the lower temperature range (15.degree.-22.degree. C) than in the higher one (22.degree.-27.degree. C). Conversely, the enhancing of respiration rate was higher in the upper temperature range. The resulting deficit of energy at high temperatures caused a reduction in body size and a significant diminution of egg production, which led to a progressive decline of the population.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1976	6	5					451	455		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1976.tb01634.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1976.tb01634.x													WOS:A1976CE43600009
J	Rengefors, K; Karlsson, I; Hansson, LA				Rengefors, K; Karlsson, I; Hansson, LA			Algal cyst dormancy: a temporal escape from herbivory	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Many phytoplankton species form resting cysts and remain dormant for part of the year. The subsequent excystment is regulated by the external environment and internal maturation processes. Here we assessed the excystment of the dinoflagellates Ceratium hirundinella and Peridinium aciculiferum in relation to herbivores and temperature in laboratory and field studies. C. hirundinella, which has a grazer-resistant morphology, forms summer blooms, whereas P. aciculiferum, which is vulnerable to grazers, grows underneath the ice during winter. In our study, herbivore abundance, and thereby grazing pressure, was low during periods when water temperatures were low, and the abundance of P. aciculiferum was high. In the laboratory experiment, excystment of C. hirundinella occurred at high temperatures irrespective of whether zooplankton exudate was added or not, whereas at intermediate temperatures, excystment was lower if zooplankton exudate was added. Germination of P. aciculiferum cysts was lower in the presence of exudate from a zooplankton culture than in controls at all temperatures. Our studies suggest that dinoflagellates use the presence of zooplankton in addition to temperature as a cue to determine when to excyst. Consequently, not only abiotic factors, but also the composition of the food web, may determine succession and composition of phytoplankton communities.					; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022; Rengefors, Karin/K-5873-2019	Rengefors, Karin/0000-0001-6297-9734; Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317													0962-8452	1471-2954				JUL 22	1998	265	1403					1353	1358		10.1098/rspb.1998.0441	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.1998.0441													WOS:000074967800013

J	Yin, XW; Balogh, SJ				Yin, XW; Balogh, SJ			Mercury concentrations in stream and river water: An analytical framework applied to Minnesota and Wisconsin (USA)	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The total concentration of all mercury species in water, [THg](w), is a key water quality measure. This paper proposes an analytical framework for the analysis, interpretation and eventual projection of stream (and river) [THg](w). Mercury (Hg) is conceptualized as being distributed among four carrier groups in water: suspended mineral particles, particulate organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, and inorganic complexes and ions. The conceptual understanding is used as a statistical analytical framework and turned into a quantitative model for Minnesota and Wisconsin based on some 1000 data cases from 18 streams (watershed area: 9 ha-115500 km(2)). The resultant model yields a coefficient of determination of 92% for [THg](w) of the fitting data subset, or 94% for the evaluation subset. Its coefficients have well defined physical meanings, and are generally consistent with independent field measurements from the same region or elsewhere. The model provides a comprehensive and quantitative view of the Hg contents of the carriers: the contents increase with the proportion of watershed area as wetlands or as forests, rise drastically and then fall precipitously during spring snowmelt, and otherwise peak in the growing season and reach a minimum in the presence of snowpack. The model further reveals that dissolved Hg tends to increase with emission-related wet sulfate deposition across the data region.

Using historical documents created in the Yangtze River Delta during these dynasties, we reconstructed the severity and frequency of locust plagues. We uncovered their temporal and spatial patterns, the relevant influencing factors, and the applied control measures. These locust plagues occurred in the Yangtze River Delta during summer and autumn and were considered moderate-degree disasters. The locust plagues during the Qing Dynasty were less harmful than those during the Ming Dynasty. The locust plagues occurred north of 31 degrees N and were concentrated around lakes and rivers. Regarding long-term changes, three periods of frequent locust plagues were identified: 1520-1540 AD, 1610-1670 AD, and 1850-1870 AD. The locust plague cycles were dominated by long-term changes of 100 and 350 years, alternating with short-term changes of 10-30 years. Locust growth and development typically occur under suitable climate conditions. However, in the Yangtze River Delta, the relationship between locust outbreaks and temperature changes was insignificant, whereas flood disasters provided suitable humidity conditions for locust nymph growth. Locust plague outbreaks had a series of social impacts, one direct result was rising food prices. When facing locust plagues, the Ming and Qing Dynasties formed effective top-down preventative measures corresponding to local conditions. The locust plagues in the Yangtze River Delta during the Ming and Qing Dynasties occurred with regularity, were responsive to local hydrological conditions, and impacted social economies and technologies.					; Li, Gang/JFA-3426-2023	Li, Gang/0000-0003-0465-9892; 													0921-030X	1573-0840				FEB	2023	115	3					2333	2350		10.1007/s11069-022-05640-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-022-05640-0		OCT 2022											WOS:000865198800001
J	Tanyileke, GZ; Kusakabe, M; Evans, WC				Tanyileke, GZ; Kusakabe, M; Evans, WC			Chemical and isotopic characteristics of fluids along the Cameroon Volcanic Line, Cameroon	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												Results of the chemical and isotopic analysis of the water and gases discharged from volcanic crater lakes and soda springs located along the Cameroon Volcanic Line were used to characterize and infer their genetic relationships. Variations in the solute compositions of the waters indicate the dominant influence of silicate hydrolysis. Na+ (40-95%) constitutes the major cation in the springs while Fe2+ + Mg2+ (70%) dominate in the CO2-rich lakes. The principal anion is HCO3- (>90%), except in the coastal springs where Cl- predominates. Lakes Nyos and Monoun have Fe-Mg-Ca-HCO3- type signatures; the soda springs are essentially Na-HCO3- type, while all other lakes show similar ionic compositions to dilute surface waters. Dissolved gases show essentially CO2 (>90%), with small amounts of Ar and N-2, while CH4 constitutes the principal component in the non-gassy lakes. Active Volcanic gases are generally absent, except in the Lobe spring with detectable H2S. Stable isotope ratio evidence indicates that the bicarbonate waters are essentially of meteoric origin. CO2 (delta(13)C = -2 to -8 parts per thousand) and He (He-3/He-4 = 1 to 5.6R(a)) infer a mantle contribution to the total CO2. CH4 has a biogenic source, while Ar and N-2 are essentially atmospheric in origin, but mixing is quite common.

J	Selig, U; Hübener, T; Michalik, M				Selig, U; Hübener, T; Michalik, M			Dissolved and particulate phosphorus forms in a eutrophic shallow lake	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Soluble and particulate phosphorus forms in the surface water of the eutrophic shallow Lake Butzow were investigated from March to November 1998. Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) of the filtered water were analysed. Suspended particulate matter (SPM) was characterized by particulate organic matter (POM), particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate phosphorus (PP), particulate iron (PFe), phytoplankton biomass (PB) and Chl a. PP was investigated in more detail by means of sequential chemical extraction (Psenner et al., 1984) and the analysis of polyphosphates and phospholipids. In spring, the lowest SRP values and highest PP values were recorded. Over the course of the year, SRP did not decline, whereas DOP increased and became the dominant P-pool in the lake in autumn. Polyphosphate, as a reserve compound in algae, was present only until July. Its decline was accompanied by an increase in phospholipids and a decrease in the easily available PP and the sorptive-bound PP. The levels of iron-bound phosphorus and the apatite-phosphorus remained stable over the year. The available phosphor-us declined, although the SRP level never dropped below 0.015 mg L(-1). Thus, insufficient phosphor-us was available in this eutrophic lake to allow formation of polyphosphate granules in algae in the second half of the year. Neither SRP nor the elemental composition of seston is suitable to describe the P-status and deficiency for algal growth in the shallow Lake Butzow.																			1015-1621						2002	64	1					97	105	UNSP 1015-1621/02/010097-09	10.1007/s00027-002-8058-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-002-8058-9													WOS:000175859300010
J	Buck, CL; Barnes, BM				Buck, CL; Barnes, BM			Temperatures of hibernacula and changes in body composition of arctic ground squirrels over winter	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												Soil temperatures near hibernacula of free-living arctic ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii) were recorded over 3 winters (October-April 1993-1996) at Toolik Lake, Alaska. Means and minima of soil temperature at 20 burrows averaged -8.9 arid -18.8degreesC, respectively. Soil temperatures were <-3 degrees C for, on average, >5 months, which represented the duration of winter that hibernating arctic ground squirrels were actively thermogenic. Individual burrows did not differ significantly in mean soil temperature over 3 years, but significant differences in mean and minimum soil temperatures were observed among burrows. Sites of burrows with shrubby vegetation accumulated more snow and had significantly higher soil temperatures over winter than windswept sites in non-shrubby vegetation. Female ground squirrels hibernated in burrows that had significantly higher mean and minimum soil temperatures than burrows of males, and adults hibernated in burrows with significantly higher soil temperatures than burrows of juveniles. Although ground squirrels occupying colder burrows were predicted to lose more body mass during hibernation than those in warmer burrows, changes in body, fat, and lean masses over winter were not correlated with soil temperature for any sex or age. Relationships between change in body composition of hibernating arctic ground squirrels and temperatures of their hibernacula may be confounded by use of food caches, differing thermal conductance of nests, or differences in individual's energetics of hibernating not related to the gradient between body and soil temperatures.					; Buck, C.

J	HARTMAN, WL; HEARD, WR; DRUCKER, B				HARTMAN, WL; HEARD, WR; DRUCKER, B			MIGRATORY BEHAVIOR OF SOCKEYE SALMON FRY AND SMOLTS	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												Considerable new data on the characteristics of sockeye fry and smolt migrations, direct underwater observations of migrating smolts, and a review of the literature are presented here with a synthesis, evaluation, and interpretation of possible survival advantages of these phenomena. Most fry migrations from spawning areas to nursery lakes take place in the spring, when harsh winter conditions in lakes are moderating and the growing season is beginning. Smolt migrations to salt water closely follow spring breakup of the ice and warming of the lake water. The time of smolt migration is correlated closely with latitude: migration is earlier in southern streams than in northern streams. The duration of seasonal migration appears to be strongly related to travel distance to the trunk river outlet. The smolt exodus is rapid and regular in single-lake systems but irregular and extended in multilake or multibasin systems. The frequency distribution of smolts migrating from 2-lake or 2-basin systems is usually bimodal. Most migrations commence as water temperatures near 40 F and are over when temperatures approach 50 F. Migrations of smolts and especially fry are mainly confined to the darkest hours of the night. In general, in any one season, the oldest and the largest smolts in each age-group migrate first. Other factors, such as the thickness of the ice, effectiveness of solar radiation in melting ice and warming water, and daily weather (including sunlight and wind), also influence seasonal and diel migration patterns. Underwater observations of smolts at night during migration show that they are schooled, travel in the upper water levels in shallow rivers and deeper (but not near the bottom) in deeper rivers, and usually face downstream and swim as they migrate. During migrations, fry and smolts are both often subjected to a depensatory mortality from intense predation by birds and fish. A factor disporportionately affecting different smolt populations is the length and number of restricted passages along the route to the ocean. Smolts migrating in miltilake systems must encounter heavier predation than smolts migrating from single-lake systems. Predation is probably minimized en route because of innate migratory behavior patterns. Exceptions to the general migratory behavior of fry and smolts are described to show the wide range in behavioral response to variable environmental situations.																									1967	24	10					2069	+		10.1139/f67-171	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f67-171													WOS:A1967A007600004

Laboratory incubations and autoradiography studies indicated that active sulfur cycling is occurring in the abundant microbial mats at Zodletone spring. Anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria oxidize sulfide to sulfate, which is reduced by sulfate-reducing bacterial populations. The microbial community at Zodletone spring was analyzed by cloning and sequencing 16S rRNA genes. A large fraction (83%) of the microbial mat clones belong to sulfur- and sulfate-reducing lineages within delta-Proteobacteria, purple sulfur gamma-Proteobacteria, epsilon-Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and filamentous Cyanobacteria of the order Oscillatoria as well as a novel group within gamma-Proteobacteria. The 16S clone library constructed from hydrocarbon-exposed sediments at the source of the spring had a higher diversity than the mat clone library (Shannon-Weiner index of 3.84 compared to 2.95 for the mat), with a higher percentage of clones belonging to nonphototrophic lineages (e.g., Cytophaga, Spirochaetes, Planctomycetes, Firmicutes, and Verrucomicrobiae). Many of these clones were closely related to clones retrieved from hydrocarbon-contaminated environments and anaerobic hydrocarbon-degrading enrichments. In addition, 18 of the source clones did not cluster with any of the previously described microbial divisions. These 18 clones, together with previously published or database-deposited related sequences retrieved from a wide variety of environments, could be clustered into at least four novel candidate divisions. The sulfate-reducing community at Zodletone spring was characterized by cloning and sequencing a 1.9-kb fragment of the dissimilatory sulfite reductase (DSR) gene. DSR clones belonged to the Desulfococcus-Desulfosarcina-Desulfonema group, Desulfobacter group, and Desulfovibrio group as well as to a deeply branched group in the DSR tree with no representatives from cultures. Overall, this work expands the division-level diversity of the bacterial domain and highlights the complexity of microbial communities involved in sulfur cycling in mesophilic microbial mats.

J	Lofgren, BM				Lofgren, BM			A model for simulation of the climate and hydrology of the Great Lakes basin	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The Coupled Hydrosphere-Atmosphere Research Model (CHARM) was developed by coupling the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) to models of the land hydrology of the Great Lakes basin and of the evaporation and thermodynamics of the Great Lakes. It is intended for running coupled atmosphere-surface climate scenarios for the Great Lakes basin, to gain a perspective that has been missed by running hydrologic models in off-line mode, driven by the output of global general circulation models. This paper presents validation of this model using historical atmospheric data to drive the regional embedded CHARM model. The current version of CHARM simulates the near-surface air temperature in the region quite well, with some positive bias during the winter and negative bias during the summer. Biases in the temperature averaged over 1 month and over the portion of the domain that is not directly forced by observations are less than or approximately 2 K. The annual precipitation has a positive bias of 6.6% and does well at placing the lake-effect precipitation areas, but may have too strong a west-east gradient. Simulation of annually averaged runoff meets well with expectations, but additional empirical fitting may be required to replicate the seasonal cycle. Aspects of the model that remain troublesome are the tendency for unrealistically low pressure at mean sea level and for persistent heavy low stratus clouds.

Movement of walleyes in Lakes Erie and St. Clair inferred from tag return and fisheries data	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Lake Erie walleyes Sander vitreits Support important fisheries and have been managed as one stock, although preliminary tag return and genetic analyses suggest the presence of multiple stocks that migrate among basins within Lake Erie and into other portions of the Great Lakes. We examined temporal and spatial movement and abundance patterns of walleye stocks in the three basins of Lake Erie and in Lake St. Clair with the use of tag return and sport and commercial catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) data from 1990 to 2001. Based on summer tag returns, western basin walleyes migrated to the central and eastern basins of Lake Erie and to Lake St. Clair and southern Lake Huron, while fish in the central and eastern basins of Lake Erie and in Lake St. Clair were primarily caught within the basins where they were tagged. Seasonal changes in sport and commercial effort and CPUE in Lake Erie confirmed the walleye movements suggested by tag return data. Walleyes tagged in the western basin but recaptured in the central or eastern basin of Lake Erie were generally larger (or older) than those recaptured in the western basin of Lake Erie or in Lake St. Clair. Within spawning stocks, female walleyes had wider ranges of movement than males and there was considerable variation in movement direction, minimum distance moved (mean distance between tagging sites and recapture locations), and mean length among individual spawning stocks. Summer temperatures in the western basin often exceeded the optimal temperature (20-23 degrees C) for growth of large walleyes, and the migration of western basin walleyes might represent a size-dependent response to warm summer temperatures. Cooler temperatures and abundant soft-rayed fish probably contributed to an energetically favorable foraging habitat in the central and eastern basins that attracted large walleyes during summer.					; Cook, Heather/HLW-0158-2023	WANG, HUI-YU/0000-0002-9100-321X; Rutherford, Edward/0000-0002-7282-6667													0002-8487	1548-8659				MAR	2007	136	2					539	551		10.1577/T06-012.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T06-012.1													WOS:000245526900024

We analyzed the effects of upstream hydropower operation and oligotrophication on light attenuation and reflectance in Lake Brienz (Switzerland). For this purpose, we reconstructed its light regime for the pre-dam condition and for periods of 4-fold increased primary productivity, based on direct observations of light and beam attenuation as well as concentrations of optically active compounds, especially observed and simulated mineral particle concentrations. Based on our assessment, light attenuation before the construction of upstream dams was double the current value during summer and nearly half in winter. This result is consistent with pre-dam measurements of Secchi depths in the early 1920s. Using a simple optical model, a significant increase in reflectance since the 1970s was estimated, assuming a 4-fold decrease of optical active organic compounds within the lake. As reflectance is perceived by human eyes as turbidity, this may explain subjective reports by local residents of increasing turbidity in recent years.

J	PRIDDLE, J				PRIDDLE, J			PRODUCTION ECOLOGY OF BENTHIC PLANTS IN SOME ANTARCTIC LAKES .1. INSITU PRODUCTION STUDIES	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The vegetation of 3 oligotrophic lakes on Signy Island (Antarctica) is dominated by benthic algal felts and aquatic mosses, and the phytoplankton is sparse. Five seasonal factors affect underwater irradiance-daylength, the sun''s elevation, ice- and snow-cover and water clarity. Calculated irradiance at the bottom of the lake varies from about 1 at midwinter to 2600 kJ/m per day in early summer. Primary production of 3 representative benthic communities was measured in situ at monthly intervals over 11 mo. Photosynthesis and respiration were estimated from changes in oxygen concentration in light and dark bottles using a semi-micro-Winkler method. There was measurable production for 9 mo. of the year, but the plants were below compensation point during early winter (June to early Aug.). Compensation and light-saturation points were both at unusually low irradiance. Maximum production rate (measured as O2 evolution rate per unit ash-free dry weight, .mu.g/mg per day) was: Tolypothrix-Plectonema community (Sombre Lake) 10.8; Phormidium-dominated algal felt (Changing Lake) 4.2; aquatic mosses Calliergon and Drepanocladus (Moss Lake) 7.7. Calculated as equivalent carbon production, these rates are 4, 1.5 and 3 .mu.g/ml per day. Annual production as carbon per unit area of lake for the 3 communities was 9, 3.3 and 4 g/m2. Comparison is made with similar lakes in the Arctic and Antarctic. The polar environment accentuates the differences between lakes dominated by either phytoplankton or by benthic vegetation.																			0022-0477	1365-2745					1980	68	1					141	153		10.2307/2259248	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2259248													WOS:A1980JK96200009
J	Cyr, H				Cyr, Helene			Winds and the distribution of nearshore phytoplankton in a stratified lake	WATER RESEARCH												The distribution of phytoplankton in lakes is notoriously patchy and dynamic, but wind-driven currents and algal buoyancy motility are thought to determine where algae accumulate. In this study, nearshore phytoplankton were sampled from different parts of a lake basin twice a day for 4-5 consecutive days, in the spring and in late summer, to test whether short-term changes in phytoplankton biomass and community composition can be predicted from wind-driven currents. On windy days, phytoplankton biomass was higher at downwind than at upwind nearshore sites, and the magnitude of this difference increased linearly with increasing wind speed. However, contrary to the generally assumed downwind phytoplankton aggregations, these differences were mostly due to upwelling activity and the dilution of phytoplankton at upwind nearshore sites. The distribution of individual taxa was also related to wind speed, but only during late stratification (except for cryptophytes), and these relationships were consistent with the buoyancy and motility of each group. On windy days, large diatoms and cyanobacteria concentrated upwind, neutrally buoyant taxa (green algae, small diatoms) were homogeneously distributed, and motile taxa (cryptophytes, chrysophytes, dinoflagellates) concentrated downwind. Predictable differences in the biomass and composition of phytoplankton communities could affect the efficiency of trophic transfers in nearshore areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Li, Y; Wang, NA; Zhang, CQ; Wang, Y				Li, Yu; Wang, NaiAng; Zhang, ChengQi; Wang, Yue			Early Holocene environment at a key location of the northwest boundary of the Asian summer monsoon: a synthesis on chronologies of Zhuye Lake, Northwest China	JOURNAL OF ARID LAND												The intensified monsoon increases summer rainfall and creates wet conditions in the Asian summer monsoon region during the early Holocene. Along with millennial-scale changes of the monsoon intensity, it is still unclear whether the boundary of the monsoon region changes according to monsoon variability. Investigations into the early Holocene environment in monsoon marginal zones are crucial for understanding the monsoon boundary changes. Zhuye Lake is located at the northwest edge of the Asian summer monsoon, the northern Qilian Mountains, which are less affected by modern summer monsoon water vapor. Previous studies have reached different conclusions regarding the early Holocene climatic and environmental changes based on different dating methods (C-14 and OSL (optically stimulated luminescence)) and materials (shells, carbonate, pollen concentrates and bulk organic carbon). In this study, we synthesized 102 C-14 dates and 35 OSL dates from ten Holocene sedimentary sections and ten paleo-shorelines in the lake basin. A comparison between ages from different dating methods and materials generally shows that carbon reservoir effects are relatively slight in Zhuye Lake while the disordered chronologies are mainly related to the erosion processes and reworking effects. In addition, proxy data, including lithology, pollen, total organic carbon and carbonate, were collected from different sites of Zhuye Lake. According to the new synthesis, the early Holocene environment was relatively humid, associated with high runoff and lake water levels. The result indicates that the monsoon boundary moves to the north during the period of the intensified monsoon. A typical arid-area lake was formed during the mid-Holocene when carbonate accumulation and high organic matter contents were the main features of this period. The lake retreated strongly during the late Holocene, showing a drought trend. Overall, the lake evolution is generally consistent with the Holocene Asian summer monsoon change, showing the monsoon influence to monsoon marginal zones.

More than 50% of the primary production was channeled through the microbial loop. Bacteria and ciliates responded rapidly to increasing phytoplankton biomass and production. Maximal growth rates of bacteria and Protozoa were slightly lower than those of the dominating phytoplankton species. Averaged over the spring bloom, bacterial C amounted to 21% of phytoplankton C, bacterial production to 18% of particulate primary production. Increase of heterotrophic flagellate populations was prevented by grazing within the microbial loop, probably mainly by the feeding impact of ciliates. Although ciliates controlled flagellate production, they satisfied their food demand primarily by feeding on algae and consumed .apprx. 14% of primary production. Metazoan microzooplankton (copepod nauplii and rotifers) removed .apprx. 7% of the phytoplankton production. Herbivorous metazooplankton ingested slightly less. Therefore, the phytoplankton bloom was not terminated by excess grazing. PO43- depletion and subsequent sedimentation was most likely the prime cause for the termination of the spring bloom.					; Weisse, Thomas/HTQ-1404-2023	Weisse, Thomas/0000-0001-6103-6558; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUN	1990	35	4					781	794		10.4319/lo.1990.35.4.0781	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1990.35.4.0781													WOS:A1990EB16800001

Strong relationships between these parameters and streamflow, and the propensity for this tributary to plunge in the reservoir in summer and fall based on its lower temperature, are reported. The entry of this stream, the primary tributary, into the reservoir as a turbid density current during runoff events is depicted as distinct and vertically coincident subsurface SC minima and peaks in measures of light scattering. The magnitudes of these signatures imparted to the reservoir's water column are demonstrated to be strongly dependent on the magnitude of the runoff event. The time course of the diminishment of these signatures and longitudinal differences in turbidity within the reservoir are described. The documented patterns of SC and metrics of light scattering provided by the robotic monitoring network offer a rare opportunity to support development and testing of a turbidity model with the necessary attributes of fine temporal and spatial resolution.																			1093-474X	1752-1688				APR	2006	42	2					323	335		10.1111/j.1752-1688.2006.tb03841.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2006.tb03841.x													WOS:000237031800004

The study of human pressure around lakes is of importance to understand its effects on the lakes natural resources. Social media data is a valuable space-time-resolved information source to detect human dynamics. In this study, user-generated geodata, namely users' location records provided by the Facebook Data for Good program, are used to assess population patterns and infer the magnitude of anthropic pressure in the areas surrounding the Insubric lakes (Maggiore, Como and Lugano) between Northern Italy and Southern Switzerland. Patterns were investigated across different lakes' neighbouring areas as well as seasons, days of the week, and day hours in the study period May 2020-August 2021. Two indicators were conceived, computed and mapped to assess the space-time distribution of users around lakes and infer the anthropic pressure. The highest pressure was found around lakes Maggiore and Como coastal areas during weekends in summer (up to +14% average users presence than weekdays in winter), suggesting tourism is the primary accountable reason for the pressure. Contrarily, around lake Lugano, the population dynamic is mostly affected by commuters or weekly workers, where the maximum pressure occurs during weekdays in all seasons (+6.6% average users presence than weekends). Results provide valuable input to further analyses connected, for example, to the correlation between human activities and lake-water quality and/or prediction models for anthropic pressure and tourism fluxes on lakes that are foreseen for the future development of this work.

We used two years of high frequency measurements and monitoring of 5-m deep and hypereutrophic Lake Ormstrup, Denmark to study the dynamics of temporary stratification and its effects on oxygen concentrations, nutrient cycling, greenhouse gas emissions and fish habitat use. Temporary stratification followed by complete mixing of the water column occurred several times each summer, but its duration was highly variable between years despite only small climatic variations. Anoxia at depths greater than 2-3 m developed within a few days after stratification. During anoxia fish accumulated in the upper 2 m and high accumulation of phosphate (up to 1.34 mg/l), ammonia (up to 2.32 mg/l) and greenhouse gases (methane up to 5 mg/l) occurred at depths greater than 2-3 m that were released at mixing. Lake Ormstrup is an example of how very dynamic, unpredictable, and variable mixing conditions develop each summer with significant implications for fish habitat use, nutrient dynamics and greenhouse gas emissions. This might adjust our view of these lakes in a management and climate change perspective.					; Baktoft, Henrik/E-6581-2011; Skov, Christian/X-6511-2019; Davidson, Thomas/C-6542-2011; Søndergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019; Sondergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019	Nielsen, Anders/0000-0002-5885-4100; Kragh, Theis/0000-0002-9760-2571; Baktoft, Henrik/0000-0002-3644-4960; Davidson, Thomas/0000-0003-2326-1564; Skov, Christian/0000-0002-8547-6520; Sondergaard, Martin/0000-0002-1514-0482													0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2023	850	1					65	79		10.1007/s10750-022-05039-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-022-05039-9		OCT 2022											WOS:000869614700007

Patterns of Rotifer Diversity in the Chihuahuan Desert	DIVERSITY-BASEL												Desert aquatic systems are widely separated, lack hydrologic connections, and are subject to drought. However, they provide unique settings to investigate distributional patterns of micrometazoans, including rotifers. Thus, to understand rotifer biodiversity we sampled 236 sites across an array of habitats including rock pools, springs, tanks, flowing waters, playas, lakes, and reservoirs in the Chihuahuan Desert of the USA (n = 202) and Mexico (n = 34) over a period of >20 years. This allowed us to calculate diversity indices and examine geographic patterns in rotifer community composition. Of similar to 1850 recognized rotifer species, we recorded 246 taxa (similar to 13%), with greatest diversity in springs (n = 175), lakes (n = 112), and rock pools (n = 72). Sampling effort was positively related to observed richness in springs, lakes, rivers, and tanks. Nestedness analyses indicated that rotifers in these sites, and most subsets thereof, were highly nested (support from 4 null models). Distance was positively correlated with species composition dissimilarity on small spatial scales. We predicted species richness for unsampled locations using empirical Bayesian kriging. These findings provide a better understanding of regional rotifer diversity in aridlands and provide information on potential biodiversity hotspots for aquatic scientists and resource managers.

Internal iron loading and warm temperatures are preconditions for cyanobacterial dominance in embayments along Georgian Bay, Great Lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Previous work suggests that a high rate of internal ferrous iron (Fe2+) loading from anoxic sediments into overlying waters favours cyanobacteria dominance (>50% of the phytoplankton biomass) over eukaryotic algae. This Cyanobacteria-Ferrous conceptual model was assessed along the Georgian Bay coastline of Lake Huron, Ontario, in one meso-eutrophic and three oligotrophic embayments that experience natural hypolimnetic anoxia. Cyanobacteria dominated all embayments in the relatively warmer summer of 2012 but not in the much cooler summer of 2014, although hypolimnetic anoxia and internal Fe2+ loading were observed in both summers in all embayments. A cyanobacteria bloom large enough to turn the lake visibly green was observed only in warmer 2012 in the meso-eutrophic embayment. Results show that warm summer temperatures and internal Fe2+ loading are necessary preconditions for cyanobacteria dominance, while high nutrient levels are needed to form large blooms. There were no consistent patterns between dominance and total and dissolved phosphorus (P), total nitrogen, ammonium, and nitrate. Internal P loading was not a necessary precondition for dominance. While P removal programs will decrease phytoplankton biomass in eutrophic waters, oxidized surficial sediments must be maintained throughout an aquatic system to prevent cyanobacteria dominance.

Remote sensing provides an effective tool for quantifying the trophic state of inland waters by associating the trophic state index (TSI) with optically active water quality parameters. However, limited by the satellite coverage range and operation time, the long-term changes in the trophic state of the EPL region have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aims to fill this gap by generating a 35-year (1986-2020) TSI dataset of lakes in the eastern plain based on Landsat images. The TSI inversion algorithm based on the algal biomass index (ABI) was designed for Landsat series after consistency analysis. The seasonal variations of the TSI showed the highest TSI (62.0 +/- 11.4) in summer and the lowest TSI (51.6 +/- 8.0) in winter, with uncertainties caused by the limitation of ABI for extremely turbid waters and the number of Landsat seasonal images. The TSI of the EPLs increased over the past 35 years by about 8.2%. Four change patterns were defined for the long-term interannual TSI variations: increasing trend less than 50% (Mode 1) or more than 50% (Mode 2), breaking points that show a surge trend (Mode 3), and decreasing trend (Mode 4). The contribution of meteorological and anthropogenic factors was calculated using a generalized linear model, which revealed that the eutrophication of inland lakes in the EPL region is mainly affected by industrial wastewater discharge and urban expansion. The influence of these explanatory variables becomes more complex with an increase in lake area. Our research provides an estimation of the TSI for the first 35-year basin-scale in the EPL region and a comprehensive evaluation of the driving factors of inland water eutrophication. The results can be used for the effective management and restoration of lakes.

In this study, the streamflow response to future climate change and land use change and their relative effect is investigated using a Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 multi-model ensemble, in conjunction with a raster-based Xin'anjiang model to simulate future streamflows under three climate change scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5) and three land use change scenarios ("constant," "current rate," and "double rate") in the Xinjiang basin, China. The results show that the monthly streamflows in the period of 2020-2055 increase substantially at rates ranging from 5.9 to 35.5 % in the autumn and early winter months, but those decrease at rates ranging from -5.5 to -48.1 % in the other months. Annual streamflow also significantly decreases by 148-279 mm under different climate and land use change scenarios. The relative effect of climate change on annual and most monthly streamflows is significantly higher than that of land use change. However, the land use change effect becomes increasingly evident over time and can mitigate the climate change effect from January to August and enhance it in the other months. Moreover, the relative effect of land use change on streamflow is relatively greater in the dry period than that in wet period.

Profiles of the daytime atmospheric turbulence above Big Bear solar observatory	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS												Context. Space weather has become acutely critical for today's global communication networks. To understand its driving forces we need to observe the Sun with high angular-resolution, and within large fields-of-view, i.e. with multi-conjugate adaptive optics correction. Aims. The design of a multi-conjugate adaptive optical system requires the knowledge of the altitude distribution of atmospheric turbulence. We have therefore measured daytime turbulence profiles above the New Solar Telescope (NST), on Big Bear Lake. Methods. To this purpose, a wide-field wavefront sensor was installed behind the NST. The variation of the wavefront distortions with angular direction allows the reconstruction of the distribution of turbulence. Results. The turbulence is found to have three origins: 1. a ground layer (<500 m) that contains 55-65% of the turbulence, 2. a boundary layer between 1-7 km comprises 30-40% of the turbulent energy, 3. and the remaining similar to 5% are generated in the tropopause, which is above 12 km in summer and between 8 and 12 km in winter. Conclusions. A multi-conjugate adaptive optical system should thus aim at correcting the ground turbulence, the center of the boundary layer at roughly 3 km altitude and, eventually, the upper boundary layer around 6 km altitude.																			0004-6361					JUN	2012	542								A2	10.1051/0004-6361/201218844	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201218844													WOS:000305803300089

Five limnological episodes are identified in the diatom and geochemical records. The initial lake stage, Episode I (similar to 11,000-10,850 cal. yr B.P.) is characterized by the absence of biogenic production and a high influx of clastic sediments. Episode H (similar to 10,850-8650 cal. yr B.P.) is characterized by ice-free conditions during summer, highest bioproductivity, strong growth of planktic diatoms and anoxic bottom waters. This period represents the Holocene climatic optimum. Deterioration of climatic conditions commenced in Episode III (similar to8650-7000 cal. yr B.P.) as indicated by distinctly lower bioproductivity and longer persistence of winter ice on the lake. During Episode IV (similar to7000-2500 cal. yr B.P.), the diatom and pollen records indicate that temperatures were cool and the growing season was short. Finally, in Episode V (similar to2500 cal. yr B.P. to present), limnological conditions, indicated by increased organic carbon and diatom deposition, initially suggest improved conditions followed by a return to modem conditions beginning similar to500 cal. yr B.P. The pollen stratigraphy from Lake Lyadhej-To is consistent with other paleoclimatic records from northern Eurasia, confirming rapid postglacial warming, the presence of dense tree forests during the climatic optimum, and finally a gradual southward retreat of the treeline towards its modem location.

Loss of wetlands, reduction of shoreline cover and structure, cultural eutrophication, and siltation have negatively affected water transparency, abundance of macrophyte habitat, and even body condition. We review recent habitat restoration programs conducted in the Great Lakes Basin to reverse this trend. However, assessment has usually been inadequate to evaluate their success. Spawning and nursery requirements (first year of life) are examined, using a system for classifying and ranking major physical characteristics and requirements. Depth of nursery habitat is directly correlated with fish size and age. Spawning habitat is usually less critical or limiting but more easily manipulated and restored than nursery or juvenile-adult habitats. Year-class strength over 22 yr in eastern Lake Ontario was correlated positively with midsummer temperature and negatively with late summer-early fall water elevation; also, the largest year-class appeared immediately after catastrophic winterkill of a predator, white perch (Morone americana). Both implicate nursery rather than spawning associations. Adult abundance is related to the extent of macrophyte cover, which is optimal from 35 to 80% but inversely related to body size.																			0706-652X						1996	53			1			161	174		10.1139/cjfas-53-S1-161	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-53-S1-161													WOS:A1996VK06200018

Although trout living with or without white sucker, Catostomus commersoni, were similarly spatially distributed, they had different diets, suggesting a feeding niche shift of trout in the presence of sucker; we concluded that this shift is under phenotypic control because each planted strain came from similar genetic backgrounds. Sexual maturity was related to the size of individuals, regardless of the strain, and males matured before females. Almost all males and females were sexually mature in the first fall after stocking except wild females (3.0 and 75% matured during the first and second fall, respectively). Gonadosomatic indices (GSI) of domestic and hybrid females were similar during the first fall, but the GSI of domestic females was significantly higher than that of hybrid and wild strains in the second fall. Mean egg diameters were similar among the three strains during the two falls, but fecundity of domestic females, after correction for size differences, was significantly higher than that of hybrid females which, in turn, was significantly higher than that of wild ones.

Oxygen and hydrogen isotopes of stream and lake waters are ideal to characterize sources and transport pathways of incoming precipitation. In order to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics and further explore the formation reason and environmental significance, major ions and isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen were measured in lake, river and spring water samples collected in Tajikistan from September to October 2011. Ca2+ and HCO3 (-) were the dominant ions of river and spring waters, and originated mainly from carbonate weathering. The northwestern waters were of the Ca-SO4 (2-) type resulting from silicate weathering. Most lakes of Tajikistan are located in the eastern, mountainous area and are of the Mg-SO4 (2-) and Na-Cl- type, reflecting persistent, long-term evaporation under an arid climate. The hydrogen and oxygen isotope values of river and spring water in Tajikistan ranged from -129 to -65aEuro degrees and -17 to -9.3aEuro degrees, respectively, and display larger variance in spatial distribution, indicating that river and spring waters in the east are supplied mainly by glaciers and waters in the west come mainly from precipitation. Regression lines between hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in waters from the eastern (delta D = 9.2 delta O-18 + 28.0) and western (delta D = 5.5 delta O-18 - 10.7) rivers and springs differ as a consequence of different moisture sources in the two areas. Significant correlations between hydrochemistry and isotope values in lake water mainly reflect the intensity of evaporation under arid climate conditions.					li, qianyu/GXV-6594-2022														2198-7491	2198-7505				NOV	2018	5			1	SI		S127	S137		10.1007/s40710-018-0312-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40710-018-0312-9													WOS:000452594000009
J	Oroud, IM				Oroud, Ibrahim M.			The annual surface temperature patterns across the Dead Sea as retrieved from thermal images	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Satellite images capture a large scene instantaneously, enabling direct comparisons of surface-atmosphere interactions in a static time domain. The annual course of surface temperature of the Dead Sea is investigated using thermal images obtained from Band 10 onboard Landsat 8. Retrieved sea surface temperature varied from around 20 degrees C in February to 35 degrees C in July. Retrieved sea surface temperature is commensurate with extensive field measurements, with a root mean square error of 1.25 degrees C. Satellite images reveal three distinct thermal patterns. The first one is the presence of temperature variations across the open sea which may reflect differences in local meteorology and/or differential mixing with the deeper layers. The second feature is the different temperature skewness patterns between winter and summer months. A slight negative temperature skewness is observed during the period November through February, and a steep positive one during the rest of the year, with large values occurring during summer. These skewness patterns reflect the variations in the annual course of heating and cooling mechanisms occurring in the open sea and along the shallow shorelines. The third distinct feature is the presence of cold finger plumes during the cold months, extending around 4 km inside the open sea and covering an area in excess of 3 km(2). The influence of freshwater flux on evaporation from large hypersaline water bodies is investigated using a theoretical formulation derived in this paper. Results show that the effect of freshwater flux on evaporation from hypersaline lakes is a complex process determined by activity and temperature departures. Satellite images provide an excellent surrogate to field observations which are money and labor intensive, time consuming, and very limited in their spatial coverage.																			1866-7511	1866-7538				NOV	2019	12	22							695	10.1007/s12517-019-4862-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12517-019-4862-6													WOS:000497794800002
J	Weber, GE; Furch, K; Junk, WJ				Weber, GE; Furch, K; Junk, WJ			A simple modelling approach towards hydrochemical seasonality of major cations in a Central Amazonian floodplain lake	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												To identify causes of hydrochemical seasonality, dynamic mass balance models are developed. They describe a hypothetical floodplain lake designed according to literature data supplemented by unpublished data on Lago Camaleao, an island channel lake in the lower Solimoes River. The conservative model accounts for advective and atmospheric cation fluxes, the non-conservative model additionally for biogenic cation fluxes due to growth and decomposition of the macrophyte vegetation. During much of the hydroperiod, seasonal evolutions observed for Na, Ca, and Mg, were in accordance with conservative expectation. Increasing concentrations during falling water were not explained by the conservative model. Differences between predictions of the conservative, and the non-conservative model were negligible. Thus, for the evolution of Na, Ca, and Mg, biogenic fluxes are insignificant. We suggest that cation loading during falling water is caused by an abiotic process. Evolution of K was non-conservative during much of the hydroperiod. Deviations from conservative expectation due to K loading during rising, as well as during falling water, were in accordance with predictions of the non-conservative model. Hence, during rising water, macrophyte-derived influxes of K are the key factor for deviations from conservative expectation. During falling water, however, macrophyte decomposition is still poorly understood, and unknown processes causing Na, Ca, and Mg loadings might also procure additional K loading, and thus biogenic K fluxes might not be the sole cause for increasing concentrations.

Climate change affects glaciers all over the world causing glacial recession with the formation of new lakes. Glaciers of Mount Tronador (41 degrees S, Patagonia, Argentina) underwent an increase of more than 200 m in the equilibrium-line altitude (ELA), from 1994 to 2016. The proglacial Lake Ventisquero Negro showed a continuous increase in lake surface area since 2009, when a glacial outburst flood (GLOF) occurred. The Ventisquero Negro glacier is a debris-covered glacier located below the timberline; thus, the lake receives meltwater from both clean and debris-rich ice. 2. This study analyses the proglacial lake after the GLOF event, particularly the nutrient content, dissolved organic matter and bacterial respiration. Our main hypothesis was that the melting of debris-rich and clean ice would differentially affect nutrient inputs and bacterial respiration in the early ontogeny of the lake. 3. Sampling was conducted in austral spring-summer seasons (2012 to 2016) following the GLOF event. We carried out bacterial respiration experiments with lake water and two treatments enriched with clean or debris-rich ice from the glacier. Additionally, we carried out an another enrichment experiment with phosphate-P and glucose-C alone or in combination. 4. The lake exhibited high turbidity levels due to a high concentration of suspended solids. Vertical light profiles showed that almost the entire water column was aphotic. Phosphorus (P) concentration was high and was positively related to total suspended solids. Accordingly, P concentration was higher in debris-rich than in clean ice. However, the dissolved organic carbon concentrations in the lake were found to remain relatively constant through time (less than 50 mu mol/L). 5. Analysing fluorescent excitation-emission matrices, we determined that the dissolved organic matter is very simple with only two peaks, one corresponding to protein-like compounds (C1) and the other to humic-like compounds (C2), coming from clean ice and debris-rich ice, respectively. C1 was present in all samples, while C2 was comparatively more important during summer, coinciding with higher temperatures and melting. 6. This study supports the hypothesis that melting of clean and debris-rich ice would affect DOM and P input at early stages of a proglacial lake formed by the recession of a debris-covered glacier. Bacterial respiration was observed to be positively affected by debris-rich ice melting and to be P limited. Thus, P is a major controlling factor for carbon dynamics in a newly formed proglacial lake.					; Martyniuk, Nico/GXF-9085-2022; Balseiro, Esteban/Y-2743-2019	Bastidas Navarro, Marcela/0000-0002-6558-0451; Martyniuk, Nicolas/0000-0002-2423-7040; Modenutti, Beatriz/0000-0002-8683-5679; Balseiro, Esteban/0000-0002-5052-0587													0046-5070	1365-2427				NOV	2018	63	11					1341	1351		10.1111/fwb.13161	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13161													WOS:000447134100001

Seasonal evaluation of heavy metals and zooplankton distribution and their co-relationship in the Rosetta branch area of the Nile Delta in Egypt	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The River Nile is the artery of Egypt, as it presents more than 96% of the municipal, industrial, and irrigation necessities of Egypt. This study was dedicated to providing data about the effect of pollution at six stations on the River Nile at the Rosetta branch during the period from August 2019 to April 2020, using heavy metals analysis and zooplankton as biological indicators. It was found that the average of heavy metals concentration follows the descending order Al > Fe > Mn > Zn > Ni > Co. Most of the heavy metals recorded its highest values at El-Rahawy station. Zooplankton community was represented by 32 species in addition to 4 Meroplanktons. Five groups of zooplankton were recorded, viz. Rotifera (1717 org./L), Protozoa (552 org./L), Cladocera (54 org./L), Nematoda (46 org./L), and other Meroplankton (44 org./L), dominated by Rotifera followed by Protozoa, Cladocera, Nematoda, and other Meroplanktons contributing 71%, 23%, 2%, 2%, and 2%, respectively. The highest average density of total zooplankton was recorded during spring while the lowest was recorded during summer. The highest similarity of (79.12%) was observed between (Site 1) and (Site 5). Almost all diversity indices were conducted and showed its highest values in site 6. The principal component analysis conducted between heavy metals, and zooplankton showed a significant negative correlation was shown for the dominant zooplankton with the heavy metals except with cobalt. Nematoda and the rotifer Brachionus angularis recorded a positive correlation with heavy metals except cobalt.

In this study, a 1-D hydrodynamic-biogeochemical coupled model is developed to investigate their effects at a mid-depth offshore site in Lake Michigan. Model simulation shows that water surface temperature and vertical thermal structure can be well reproduced. Driven by the simulated vertical mixing, the biological model solves the transport and transformation of nutrients, plankton and detritus in the water column. Mussel grazing and excretion are added at the bottom boundary. The biological model predicts a notable decline of phytoplankton biomass and considerable increase of dissolved phosphorus (DP) in the entire water column at the end of spring. However, the reduction of phytoplankton and the increase of DP are limited to the bottom 20 m in summer as a result of the strong stratification. Model results also show that mussels can maximize particle delivery to the benthos, as the modeled benthic diffusive flux of particulate phosphorus exceeds the passive settling rate by 4.2x on average. Model simulation over a 10-month period indicates that profundal mussels have the potential to significantly change the distribution of energy and nutrients in the water column, even in a deep and stratified environment.

Modeling circulation and seasonal fluctuations in perennially ice-covered and ice-walled Lake Untersee, Antarctica	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Lake Untersee, Antarctica, is a freshwater perennially ice covered lake bounded along its north by the Anuchin glacier. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model, used on a representative wedge-shaped lake and actual bathymetry for Lake Untersee, produces estimates for circulation and long-term temperature and mixing trends. Modeled circulation is dominated by an anticyclonic gyre in front of the glacier, with slower similar to 3mms-1 flow exhibited around the lake's perimeter, allowing effective mixing throughout most of the lake with time scales of one month. Estimated velocities bound maximal glacial flour particle size at similar to 10m for effective transport throughout the lake, consistent with the sediment's mostly fine composition observed in field studies, and mixing time scales mean nonuniformities in measured O-2 concentration likely require recent or ongoing sources. Areas in which large temperature gradients prevent exchange of fluid demonstrate minimal mixing, such as the lake's upper water layers and the anoxic basin in the south, and circulation is consistently slowed in the northern sheltered bay area. Mean flow velocities fluctuate by about one fifth of their magnitude between summer and winter, and the lake's almost homothermal body temperature varies by about one tenth of a degree over the same period. While calculated temperature profiles qualitatively agree with field data, the model's long-term equilibrium temperature differs substantially, likely due to poor description of heat transfer with the glacier. Model robustness tests show results differ by approximate to 10% when either grid scale or water temperature are halved.					; Andersen, Dale/B-4816-2013	Andersen, Dale/0000-0001-8827-1259; McKay, Christopher/0000-0002-6243-1362; Steel, Harrison/0000-0002-9625-4755													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2015	60	4					1139	1155		10.1002/lno.10086	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10086													WOS:000357894500005

The instrument has not experienced a major hardware failure. It has been continuously field calibrated for extraterrestrial responses in its five aerosol channels. The instrument's cosine response was measured in 1996 and again in 2012. In our analysis of this 15 year data set, linear interpolation of these two cosine responses was used to approximate the angular response between the two characterizations. The Salt Lake City aerosol burden increased through the mid-2000s, but has dropped to its lowest level of the record since that time despite a population increase of approximately 25%. Annually, the aerosol burden is highest in midspring and midsummer with relatively coarse aerosols during the spring peak and fine aerosols during the summer peak. There is no indication of a diurnal cycle in AOD. There is a significant, but low, correlation between PM2.5 and 500 nm AOD, and a slightly lower correlation between PM10 and 500 nm AOD. The correlations between the surface-based measurements and total column AOD explain only 13% and 9% of the variance, respectively. Measurements are continuing to track future trends.					; Michalsky, Joseph/JDW-2644-2023	MICHALSKY, JOSEPH/0000-0002-7642-6396; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				APR 27	2013	118	8					3271	3277		10.1002/jgrd.50329	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jgrd.50329													WOS:000319744200020

Also, this study used a spatial analysis to estimate spatial distributions and average deposition flux. In this study, the chemical compositions of fall-out particle samples collected at Muncheon lake from May 2010 to January 2011 were analyzed by ICP and IC. The monthly trend of deposition fluxes for fall-out particles showed highest in June (107.61 kg/km(2)/day) and lowest in October (22.22 kg/km(2)/day). The average fluxes of Fe, Si, Al, Zn and Ba are 0.44, 0.24, 0.20, 0.17, 0.09 kg/km(2)/day, respectively.

J	HARDING, JS				HARDING, JS			VARIATIONS IN BENTHIC FAUNA BETWEEN DIFFERING LAKE OUTLET TYPES IN NEW-ZEALAND	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Physico-chemical conditions and macroinvertebrate faunas of 20 South Island lake outlets were investigated in summer-early autumn of 1990-94. Four outlet types were recognised: unregulated alpine, unregulated mid/low elevation, regulated hypolimnetic and regulated epilimnetic outlets. Alpine outlet waters had significantly lower (P < 0.05) alkalinities and conductivities (6-12mg l(-1) CaCO3 and 13-45 mu S cm(-1)) than all other outlets (11-36mg l(-1) CaCO3 and 36-93 mu S cm(-1)) whereas pH values were similar among outlet types. Substrate size was significantly greater in modified epilimnetic than natural mid/low elevation outlets (P < 0.01). Total number of taxa and invertebrate densities were significantly lower in alpine and hypolimnetic outlets than natural mid/low elevation outlets (P < 0.05, and P < 0.01 respectively), and distinct differences were observed in the relative abundances of major taxonomic groups. Alpine streams were dominated by the mayflies Deleatidium (Leptophlebiidae), and Nesameletus (Siphlonuridae), the gripopterygid stonefly Zelandoperla decorata and predatory hydrobiosid caddisflies; molluscs were absent, and filter-feeding hydropsychid caddisflies rare. In contrast, the hypolimnetic outlets were dominated by filter-feeding hydropsychids (87-93 % of the fauna), and no stoneflies were found. Epilimnetic and unregulated mid/low elevation outlets had similar communities, however invertebrate densities were significantly lower in regulated surface release outlets. Altitude, outlet width, velocity, conductivity, and percentage of the catchment in forest, were all implicated as factors explaining differences in community composition.																			0028-8330						1994	28	4					417	427		10.1080/00288330.1994.9516632	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1994.9516632													WOS:A1994PZ09200011

We studied the biological communities and metabolism of Laguna de Talayuelas, a Mediterranean temporary lake selected as a model to disentangle key ecological processes. The development and activity of hydrophytes were determined by hydrology. Water depth favoured differential development of emerged-floating versus submerged species. Rooted macrophytes, especially Ranunculus, extracted nutrients from the sediments, making them bioavailable for phytoplankton after senescence. During the studied period the lake showed three functional phases. The first period, with low water depth, was governed by autotrophic processes and coincided with the development of submerged macrophytes. These accounted for most lake's productivity, and a highly diverse community was maintained. A second phase occurred by late spring, coinciding with a sudden increase of the water depth after strong rainfalls; then submerged macrophytes decayed and decomposed, and respiration increased. The lake had a net heterotrophic behaviour and biodiversity decreased. During the third period, in summer, nutrients released from macrophytes decomposition favoured phytoplankton blooms. The system turned to net autotrophy but now based on phytoplankton photosynthesis. Floating macrophytes developed, though the benthic component maintained net heterotrophy.					; Mozo, Antonio/AAE-3707-2020; Camacho, Antonio/I-3417-2015; Santamans, Anna/AAA-9932-2019	C.

The influence of water quality variables on cyanobacterial blooms and phytoplankton community composition in a shallow temperate lake	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Cyanobacterial blooms and their detrimental effects on water quality have become a worldwide problem. Vancouver Lake, a tidally influenced shallow temperate freshwater lake in Washington state, U.S.A., exhibits annual summer cyanobacterial blooms that are of concern to local resource managers. Our objectives were to describe changes in phytoplankton community composition in Vancouver Lake over seasonal, annual, and interannual time scales, and to identify strong water quality predictors of phytoplankton community structure, with an emphasis on cyanobacterial blooms, from 2007 through 2010. Cluster analysis, indicator species analysis, and non-metric multidimensional scaling were used to identify significantly different phytoplankton community groupings and to determine which environmental factors influenced community changes. From 2007 through 2009, depletion of NO3-N followed by elevated PO4-P concentration was associated with increased biomass and duration of each cyanobacterial bloom. Time-lag analysis suggested that NO3-N availability contributed to interannual changes within the summer phytoplankton community. Specifically, in summer 2010, a distinct cyanobacteria community was not present, potentially due to increased NO3-N and decreased PO4-P and NH4-N availability. Our study provides a comprehensive assessment of species-level responses to water quality variables in a shallow non-stratifying temperate lake, contributes to a better understanding of phytoplankton dynamics, and may aid in predicting and managing cyanobacterial blooms.					; Rollwagen-Bollens, Gretchen/Q-5520-2017	Rollwagen-Bollens, Gretchen/0000-0002-5127-5720; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				JUN	2015	187	6							315	10.1007/s10661-015-4550-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-015-4550-2								25937495					WOS:000355917300002

Main hypotheses were that (H1) trends in trophic state were influenced not only by nutrient management, but also by winter weather and solar radiation, and (H2) the effects of management were more pronounced in the holomictic South basin than in the meromictic North basin of the lake. External loadings of phosphorus were strongly reduced during the study period, but key indicators of trophic state, including phosphorous concentration, primary production, chlorophyll aand deep-water oxygenation, showed inconsistent responses. Supporting H1, winter weather (parameterized using an index of the East Atlantic pattern) influenced temporal variation in phosphorus concentration and primary production in the North basin. Supporting H2, the effects of management on trophic state were clearer in the South basin, where most trophic-state indicators declined. Meromixis affected the restoration of the North basin lake by transmitting effects of climatic variation on trophic state. The added variability obscured the effects of restoration and caused sudden deteriorations in water quality, indicating that the restoration of meromictic lakes presents unique challenges.					; Bartosiewicz, Maciej/ISS-7638-2023; Lepori, Fabio/F-8966-2012	Lepori, Fabio/0000-0002-6438-9452; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2018	824	1			SI		229	242		10.1007/s10750-018-3575-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-018-3575-2													WOS:000448578500013

Estimation of total phosphorus loads for a large, flashy river of a highly developed watershed-seasonal and hysteresis effects	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Estimation of nutrient loads is important for the assessment of the links between phosphorus loading and biotic impairment. The challenge for many monitoring programs is to make the best use of available information (flow and concentration data) for load estimations. This study evaluates several total phosphorus loading estimation procedures using long-term (1990-2009) data from a large, highly developed watershed that flows into Lake Simcoe. The procedures involved the grouping of long-term data into 7-year moving windows, stratifying flow and concentration data, and calculating annual load for the central year of each window. A procedure involving seasonal stratification and then further stratification of the winter/spring strata by hydrograph limb performed better than stratification by flow. The former stratification distinguished more homogenous groups based on concentration versus flow relationships (significant slopes and higher r(2)) and had better sampling of flow ranges. Annual loads calculated using the Beale Ratio load estimation method ranged from 3920 to 20,642 kg (1993-2005) and were greater and more consistent than loads calculated using the method historically used to calculate loads to Lake Simcoe (the Midpoint method). It is recommended, for this river, and rivers of other regions with similar characteristics (urban/agricultural watersheds affected by seasonality and hysteresis) that sampling aims at capturing the full range of flows of the hydrograph in all seasons. Data stratified by season, hydrograph or flow should be investigated further to identify combinations of these factors; then more understanding of the concentration/flow dynamics and more accurate loads can be acquired for a system.

Greenhouse gas emission and storage in a small shallow lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Small lakes are likely to show considerable temporal variability in greenhouse gas emissions given their transient stratification and short residence time. To determine the extent that CO2 and CH4 emission and storage depends on surface meteorology, we studied a shallow lake during 2 years with contrasting rainfall and thermal stratification. Gas fluxes were estimated with wind-based and surface renewal models and compared to direct measurements obtained with floating chambers. The assessment of greenhouse gases storage revealed that the lake gained CO2 in association with rainfall in both the rainier (2011) and drier summer (2012). In 2011, stratification was less extensive and disrupted frequently. The lake was a source of CO2 and CH4, and ebullition exceeded diffusive fluxes of CH4. In 2012, stratification was more persistent, the lake was a sink for CO2 during dry periods, CO2 and CH4 accumulated in the hypolimnion later in the summer when rainfall increased, diffusive fluxes of CH4 were similar to those in 2011 mid-summer and over four times higher during overturn. Ebullition was lower in the drier summer. Fluxes measured with chambers were closer to estimations from the surface renewal model and about two times values estimated with wind-based models.

B	Omer, AM		Kowalczyk, L; Piotrowski, J		Omer, Abdeen Mustafa			ALTERNATIVE ENERGY FOR FUTURE	ENERGY COSTS, INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS AND NEW DIRECTIONS	Energy Science Engineering and Technology											Ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) provide an effective and clean way of heating buildings worldwide. They make use of renewable energy stored in the ground, providing one of the most energy-efficient ways of heating buildings. They are suitable for a wide variety of building types and are particularly appropriate for low environmental impact projects. They do not require hot rocks (geothermal energy) and can be installed in most of the world, using a borehole or shallow trenches or, less commonly, by extracting heat from a pond or lake. Heat collecting pipes in a closed loop, containing water (with a little antifreeze) are used to extract this stored energy, which can then be used to provide space heating and domestic hot water. In some applications, the pump can be reversed in summer to provide an element of cooling. The only energy used by the GSHP systems is electricity to power the pumps. Typically, a GSHP will deliver three or four times as much thermal energy (heat) as is used in electrical energy to drive the system. For a particularly environmental solution, green electricity can be purchased. The GSHP systems have been widely used in other parts of the world, including North America and Europe, for many years. Typically they cost more to install than conventional systems; however, they have very low maintenance costs and can be expected to provide reliable and environmentally friendly heating for in excess of 20 years. The GSHPs work best with heating systems, which are optimised to run at a lower water temperature than is commonly used in the UK boiler and radiator systems. As such, they make an ideal partner for underfloor heating systems. This article reviews seasonal thermal energy storage underground heat, and the potential of using heat pipe technology into the GSHP system. This research also covers soil thermal properties, estimated ground temperatures and methods of system control. It would appear to be a logical unit to rebate for a winter or summer peaking utility. The air heat pumps cannot match the lower cost of operating typical electric/gas equipment. The GSHP reduces demand and energy. Energy savings are sufficient enough to warrant added investments in the $600 to $900/ton range, especially if costs can be assumed in a 15 or 30-year mortgage.																					978-1-60741-700-2				2009							127	153																WOS:000275613700005

Migration success depends on food quality and availability at these key sites. We studied the diet composition and preferences of the Grey Plover (Pluvialis squatarola) at its migration stopover at Pomorie Lake on the South-Western Black Sea coast, Bulgaria through DNA metabarcoding of faeces collected in autumn 2020 and spring 2021. Prey availability samples were also collected from the surf zone and the supralittoral sandy shore habitats in the study area. Grey Plover had a broad diet spectrum, with 332 prey taxa in total identified by metabarcoding. Both terrestrial and marine taxa were found, suggesting that the birds use multiple coastal habitats for foraging. Terrestrial arthropods, particularly insects, predominated in the Grey Plover diet; mytilid bivalves were the most represented marine taxon. The birds had a generalist feeding strategy, with diverse prey items eaten in small quantities. Most Grey Plovers fed on insects (Diptera, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera), but some individuals showed specialisation for other taxa (mussels, spiders, polychaetes). The most abundant potential prey in the environment were not the most frequently consumed, but it is possible the prey sampling failed to capture the whole spectrum of available prey due to methodological limitations. We found no significant seasonal variation in Grey Plover diet composition, but the proportions of some prey taxa in the diet changed slightly, probably reflecting seasonal differences in their abundance and activity in coastal habitats. Our results contribute to the knowledge of Grey Plover diet, prey choice and habitat use in a little-studied region, and could help design effective conservation measures to preserve habitat quality at stopover sites for this wader and others with similar ecology.

Reliable information about current and future glaciation and runoff is crucial for water allocation, a complex task in Central Asia, where the collapse of the Soviet Union has transformed previously interdependent republics into autonomous upstream and downstream countries. Although the impacts of climate change on glaciation and runoff have been addressed in previous work undertaken in the Tien Shan (known as the 'water tower of Central Asia'), a coherent, regional perspective of these findings has not been presented until now. Here we show that glacier shrinkage is most pronounced in peripheral, lower-elevation ranges near the densely populated forelands, where summers are dry and where snow and glacial meltwater is essential for water availability. Shifts of seasonal runoff maxima have already been observed in some rivers, and it is suggested that summer runoff will further decrease in these rivers if precipitation and discharge from thawing permafrost bodies do not compensate sufficiently for water shortfalls.

Temporal variation in sediment resuspension and its influence on P concentrations and internal loading were studied in the shallow and eutrophic Kirkkojarvi basin. Gross sedimentation and sediment resuspension were estimated with sediment traps during three exposure periods in spring, midsummer, and autumn. The effects of resuspension on the concentrations of suspended solids, total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive P, and chlorophyll a were followed. The level of sediment resuspension was greatest in midsummer (July-August 63.9 g dw m(-2) d(-1)), due to strong phytoplankton blooms modifying the surface film of the sediment more prone to resuspension. The dependence of high total P concentrations (226-385 mu g L-1) on sediment resuspension and suspended solids was significant at the time. The concentrations of soluble reactive P were also high in midsummer (52-91 mu g L-1), but had a negative dependence on suspended solids. This dependence was due to algal assimilation as was proved by a negative effect of chlorophyll a on soluble reactive P. Consequently, we suggest chat the increase in the total P concentrations caused by sediment resuspension in midsummer was possibly intensified by strong algal blooms occurring at the time because strong assimilation resulting in high pH (pH 7.3 in May, 9.3-10.2 in July-August, 7.6 in October) may have increased the desorption of P from the suspended inorganic particles and intensified the P transfer into the phytoplankton biomass in midsummer.

From morning to evening hours, the time budget of waterbirds changed significantly. The differences in diurnal activities between migrants and residents were statistically significant. Foraging niche overlaps were calculated based on foraging habitats and techniques; five migrant species had exceedingly high niche overlaps (habitats 0.80-0.99; techniques 0.79-0.99). Overlap among resident birds or migrant species was much lower (habitats 0.01-0.56; techniques 0.01-0.66). Niche dimensions like the foraging habitats (1.26-3.47) and foraging techniques (1.13-4.54) and these two dimensions together (1.64-8.63) calculated the niche breadths. A mean Euclidean distance of 5.63 in Cluster analysis constructed on two niche dimensions reliably defined four distinct guilds. The post hoc test highlighted significant differences between the intra-guild niche breadths. Proportional differences in the uses of foraging habitats and techniques and temporal variations in foraging activities accommodated residents and winter migrants in the study sites. Such information would be crucially important for the conservation and effective management strategies of Indian waterbirds and their habitats, situated along the East Asian-Australian and Central Asian Flyways, which are significant tropical wintering grounds for migratory waterbirds.					; Das, Papita/K-3349-2014	Pal, Dr. Sudin/0000-0001-7195-1530; Das, Papita/0000-0002-9630-4564													1612-4642	1439-0574				APR	2023	69	2							30	10.1007/s10344-023-01648-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-023-01648-4													WOS:000945817100001

Basing on the study progresses of the sedimentation, the atmospheric model and the unique environmental background in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, and starting from December 20, 2001, we made use of a 500 NE Type aerosol sampler to collect filter samples, once a week in the past consecutive two years, in the surface air at Mt. Guanfeng, Guiyang City, China. Synchronous detailed gamma-energy spectrometric observations of Pb-210 concentrations at both Chinese and U.S. laboratories have shown that the average monthly Pb-210 concentration displays a regular U-patterns distribution of annual variations, with high values appearing in winter and low values in late spring and summer. The average annual Pb-210 concentrations are estimated to be 2.77 +/- 0.63 mBq/m(3), about 4 times the average maximum concentrations reported from quite a number of monitoring stations throughout the world. The possible factors affecting the sources of Pb-210 in the surface air in the central part of Guizhou Province are: Release of Rn-222 from the U-Ra series enriched in the soils; chemical weathering of carbonate rocks; the exploitation, processing and utilization of coal and phosphorous resources. The principal factor controlling the high Pb-210 concentrations in the surface air in the central Guizhou and their annual U-pattern distribution is the release of Rn-222. The average monthly Pb-210 concentrations show a good negative power-function relationship with increasing precipitation and also show a good negative linear-function relationship with the rise of air temperature in month grouping. Group No.1 (June to November) reflects a relatively low release of Rn-222 from soils in relatively high temperature seasons; Group No.2 (December to May) mirrors a relatively high release of Rn-222 from soils in relatively low temperature seasons. The average monthly Pb-210 concentrations simulated in terms of the precipitation and air temperature are in good consistency with the measured values, revealing that the regular U-pattern distribution characteristics of Pb-210 concentrations in the surface air in the central Guizhou are controlled predominantly by regional precipitation and air temperature. Meanwhile, it is also indicated that the magnitude of variation of air temperature and precipitation within the same year also constrains the ratio of high values over low values of average monthly Pb-210 concentrations. On a month time scale, precipitation and air temperature are a main factor affecting the release of Rn-222 from soils (rocks). In this aspect strong evidence has been obtained.

Monitoring Lake Simcoe Water Clarity Using Landsat-5 TM Images	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												This study focuses on utilizing satellite remote sensing to monitor the water clarity of Lake Simcoe, Ontario, Canada, which has been suffering from the overload of phosphorus (TP) and therefore eutrophication for decades. The dataset includes 22 cloud-free Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images, as well as the nearly simultaneous in-situ observations from 15 stations on the lake. Compared to the general model used to estimate the Secchi Disk Transparency (SDT), a parameter for water clarity measurements, an improved model is developed, from the TM images. The results of these estimations are validated using the in-situ data by linear regression, and the accuracies are measured by the coefficient of determination R (2). The results reveal an indication of high model fit between the majority of SDT predictions and the in-situ observations. Also, the improved SDT model provides higher prediction accuracies than the general one when applied to 68.2% (15 out of 22) of the images. The estimated clarity maps indicate that the turbid water is normally distributed at the nearshore areas and the northeastern region. Meanwhile, the southwestern lake has much clearer water than the other regions. In addition, the southern bay has always been suffering from a serious water quality problem even till now. The water clarity of Lake Simcoe shows strong seasonal patterns, that it is at its worst in August and September annually and much better in the other sampling seasons. On an overall scale, the lake water clarity kept relatively stable from 1987 until the fall of 1992, followed by a gradual increase until 2000, after a slight decrease, and lastly stayed consistent until the summer of 2008.					; Li, Jonathan/AAA-7712-2021	LI, Jonathan/0000-0001-7899-0049; 													0920-4741					JUN	2011	25	8					2015	2033		10.1007/s11269-011-9792-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-011-9792-3													WOS:000290585700006

Little is known about its life history and movements downstream of Kootenai Falls, Montana. Between 1998 and 2006, 19 bull trout were monitored in the Kootenai River with radio and sonic transmitters. Two bull trout life history patterns were found; 16 bull trout were likely fluvial, and two were adfluvial. Evidence of spawning was found for only about 33% of the bull trout tracked; of those, 50% were annual spawners and 50% alternate-year spawners. Temperature of the Kootenai River during spawning migration of six bull trout that made spawning migrations ranged from 7.1 degrees C to 15.0 degrees C and averaged 11.4 degrees C. Telemetry data indicated nine bull trout concentrated below Kootenai Falls during the spawning season, but it is not known if they spawned. Two tagged bull trout were located in Kootenay Lake, BC. One fish returned to the river and moved a total of 228 km from Kootenay Lake through Idaho and to Kootenai Falls. Bull trout also used several tributary streams outside of the spawning season, possibly as a thermal refuge.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				MAR	2011	26	1					65	76		10.1080/02705060.2011.553854	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2011.553854													WOS:000289598000009

As much of the evidence has come from laboratory studies, it is important to investigate the extent to which these studies reproduce the real cyclomorphic conditions occurring in nature. The present study was planned to compare the differences in the potential intensity of cyclomorphogenic factors in the laboratory and in nature. For this, we conducted two experiments in the laboratory and the field at the same time using the small cladoceran Bosmina longirostris and a predacious copepod. The results of the present experiments suggested that an abiotic factor, lower temperature acted as a key factor enhancing the changes in both the length and shape of antennules in Bosmina, which had been governed by different signals from predators. The lower temperature can be effective in helping prey bosminids to detect a severe predation threat by cyclopoid copepods, since that condition is a feature of spring and fall, a time when copepods are abundant.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2009	617						171	179		10.1007/s10750-008-9544-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9544-4													WOS:000261750800013

We conducted a lake-wide survey of Lake Kasumigaura, Japan, and analyzed the relationship between water temperature increases in spring and NH4+ and PO43- release fluxes. We also developed a numerical model to analyze how water temperature increase affects sediment temperature. Water temperature in May increased during 2010-2019 at a rate of 1.8-3.2 degrees C decade(-1). The numerical simulation results showed that the water temperature increase was accompanied by a sediment temperature increase from a minimum of 18.3 degrees C in 2011 to a maximum of 21.6 degrees C in 2015. Despite the substantial difference in the observed sediment temperature (2.9 degrees C), no significant differences in NH4+ and PO43- fluxes in May between 2013/2014 and 2015 were found. These results suggest that both water and sediment temperatures are increasing in Lake Kasumigaura in spring, but it is unclear whether this warming has affected NH4+ and PO43- releases from the sediment. However, because a nonlinear response to sediment temperature was observed, future springtime warming may accelerate NH4+ and PO43- releases.					; Shinohara, Ryuichiro/I-3595-2014; Tsuchiya, Kenji/T-1541-2019	Tsuchiya, Kenji/0000-0002-6644-1701; Shinohara, Ryuichiro/0000-0003-2716-3312; 													2040-2244	2408-9354				NOV	2021	12	7			SI		3187	3199		10.2166/wcc.2021.145	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2021.145		JUN 2021											WOS:000669450300001

PHYCOLOGIA												We characterized 8 1 isolates of picoplankton and other small planktonic coccoid green algae from Lake Itasca, Itasca State Park, MN, USA. Sequence analysis and examination by light microscopy revealed three common algae: Pseudodictyos-phaerium/Korshpalmella spp. (Chlorophyceae), Choricystis spp. (Trebouxiophyceae) and a previously undescribed autosporic coccoid. The Pseudodictyosphaerium and Korshpalmella species that were evaluated all possessed identical 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and rbcL sequences, but this 18S rDNA sequence differed from the published 18S rDNA sequence for A jurisii isolated from Europe. These chlorophycean algae were isolated from samples collected from Lake Itasca during all seasons. The 18S rDNA sequence of some of the Itasca isolates of Choricystis was nearly identical to the published sequence for C. minor; however, six different rbcL sequences were detected among the Choricystis isolates and none of these rbcL sequences matched published sequences for isolates from several lakes in Europe. The different rbcL sequence types of Choricystis had distinct seasonal distributions in Lake Itasca. These results extend our knowledge of the distribution of Pseudodictyosphaerium and Choricystis and suggest that Choricystis is even more diverse than previously thought. In addition, the distinct sequences of marker genes for Lake Itasca isolates indicate that these organisms have diverged from the European isolates. The previously undescribed alga isolated from Lake Itasca is a sister taxon to the trebolixiophyte lineage that includes Chlorella vulgaris, but differs from true Chlorella species in that it lacks a pyrenoid. Based upon this difference and molecular analyses, these isolates are described as Meyerella planktonica, gen. et sp. nov. (Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyta). All M. planktonica isolates examined possessed identical 18S rDNA, rbcL and ribosomal internal transcribed spacer sequences. Meyerella planktonica was isolated almost exclusively from winter and spring samples.																			0031-8884	2330-2968				JAN	2005	44	1					35	48		10.2216/0031-8884(2005)44[35:DAEOSC]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.2216/0031-8884(2005)44[35:DAEOSC]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000227245000005

HYDROBIOLOGIA												Reservoirs are river-lake hybrid ecosystems characterized by a marked longitudinal zonation and variable flushing rates depending on the use of stored waters. The structure of their phytoplankton is therefore subjected to the interplay between the environmental conditions of the different zones (species sorting) and the strength of the unidirectional flow (mass effect). The spatial distribution of spring phytoplankton was investigated in a tropical reservoir across its different zones. Phytoplankton displayed heterogeneous spatial patterns from the turbulent, nutrient-rich riverine zones to the relatively stable lacustrine zone. The analysis of this spatial heterogeneity revealed the relative importance of species sorting and mass effect in this morphologically complex reservoir. Different taxonomic groups showed different spatial patterns due to their specific physiological and morphological features, and as a result of the local environmental filtering. In the studied reservoir, the strength of the homogenizing effect of water flow did not smooth the spatial heterogeneity and played a weak role in constraining spring phytoplankton. Actually, water flow contributed to the spatial heterogeneity of phytoplankton by enhancing the local environmental differences caused by an operational drop in water level, and species sorting resulted as the primary forcing in determining spring phytoplankton spatial distribution.					; Naselli-Flores, Luigi/A-3824-2008	Lin, Qiuqi/0000-0002-9643-3665; Naselli-Flores, Luigi/0000-0003-3748-3862													0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2018	819	1					109	122		10.1007/s10750-018-3651-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-018-3651-7													WOS:000434373400008

Shifts in the partitioning of benthic and pelagic primary production within and across summers in Lake Myvatn, Iceland	INLAND WATERS												The relative contributions of benthic and pelagic primary production affect ecosystem function, but studies documenting natural variation in the partitioning of production (i.e., autotrophic structure) are uncommon. This study examines autotrophic structure of shallow Lake Myvatn over 7 summers (2012-2018). We used routine measurements of benthic gross primary production (GPP), pelagic chlorophyll a concentrations, and pelagic production to estimate benthic and pelagic maximum productivity (P-max) across summers. With these parameters and corresponding incident light and water clarity data, we estimated in situ benthic and pelagic GPP. Our results demonstrated substantial variation in Myvatn's autotrophic structure within and across summers. Benthic GPP often exceeded pelagic GPP. However, periods of increased phytoplankton abundance were associated with increased light attenuation and, consequently, declines in benthic GPP. These effects were strongest in 3 summers with dense cyanobacteria blooms, in which the benthic fraction of total production declined from >95% to P-max, implying that past shading by phytoplankton may decrease the photosynthetic potential of benthic producers. Moreover, variation in estimated benthic P-max values can affect the point at which autotrophic structure shifts toward pelagic-dominated conditions. Overall, our study demonstrates that the balance between benthic and pelagic production can vary greatly at intra- and interannual scales because of changes in the photosynthetic capacity of both pelagic and benthic primary producers. Understanding natural variation in lake autotrophic structure may inform how benthic and pelagic production respond to ongoing and future environmental changes.					; Ives, Anthony/A-5698-2008	Phillips, Joseph/0000-0003-2016-1306; Botsch, Jamieson/0000-0003-0670-9785; McCormick, Amanda/0000-0002-1742-0867													2044-2041	2044-205X				JAN 2	2021	11	1					13	28		10.1080/20442041.2020.1859868	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2020.1859868													WOS:000622169000001

Changing Lake Dynamics Indicate a Drier Arctic in Western Greenland	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The water balance of the Arctic tundra is shifting as permafrost stability, seasonality, and the ratio of precipitation to evaporation respond to amplified Arctic warming. While in some northern tundra locations there has been a notable increase in the number of water bodies, generally, the tundra landscape has experienced a decline in the number and area of lakes. We analyzed changes in small lake count (<10,000 m(2)), large lake count (>10,000 m(2)), and lake surface area across the periglacial tundra of western Greenland, using historical satellite and aerial imagery and weather data from the late 1960s to present. Overall, we found a decrease in lake count (21%) and surface area (2%) across our study region. Specifically, smaller ponds were particularly prone to change, with decreases of 28% in count and 15% in surface area. Shrinking lakes often became revegetated by both emergent aquatic and terrestrial vegetation, which captures potential successional trajectories following Arctic lake drying. Additionally, while annual precipitation may be increasing, it occurred primarily during the winter months in the form of snow, which may or may not contribute to the overall growing season water budget. Conversely, the peak growing season months of June, July, and August all have experienced significant increases in potential evaporation rates, thus likely creating a water deficit for much of the growing season. These results suggest that a large section of deglaciated Greenland appears likely to become drier in the summer months, which may result in widespread ecological consequences. Plain Language Summary Arctic tundra environments may become drier as the climate continues to warm, due to changes in precipitation and evaporation patterns, and losses of permanent ground ice. In many Arctic systems, lakes are widely distributed and thus can serve as an early indicator of drying conditions. We predicted that our study region of west Greenland would be particularly susceptible to drying due to low levels of precipitation and observed warming trends at a rate of approximately 0.5 degrees C per decade. Using historical and modern satellite and aerial imagery, we observed a decrease in the number of small lakes by 28% and a 15% decrease in the total area of smaller water bodies between 1969 and 2017. Additionally, we found that many of the disappeared lakes from 1969 appeared to have become vegetated. An analysis of historical weather data suggested that water losses to the atmosphere via evaporation have likely increased, especially in the summer months, which may be contributing to observed lake decline. Declining small lake area across our study region and other parts of the Arctic can have landscape-wide effects such as changes to available animal habitat, increases in the risk of fire, and to the prevalence of drought conditions.

J	Nosaka, Y; Yamashita, Y; Suzuki, K				Nosaka, Yuichi; Yamashita, Youhei; Suzuki, Koji			Dynamics and Origin of Transparent Exopolymer Particles in the Oyashio Region of the Western Subarctic Pacific during the Spring Diatom Bloom	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												The seasonal biological drawdown of the partial pressure of CO2 (CO2) in the surface waters of the Oyashio region of the western subarctic Pacific is one of the greatest among the world's oceans. This is attributable to spring diatom blooms. Transparent exopolymer particles (TEPs) are known to affect efficiency of the biological carbon pump, and higher TEP levels are frequently associated with massive diatom blooms. However, TEP dynamics in the Oyashio region remain unclear. We investigated the TEP distribution from three cruises during the spring diatom bloom periods in 2010 and 2011. TEP concentrations varied from < 15 to 196 +/- 71 mu g xanthan gum equiv. L-1 above 300 m and generally declined with depth. Vertical TEP concentrations were significantly related not only to chlorophyll a concentrations but also to bacterial abundance. Average TEP concentrations within the mixed layer (> 30 m) were significantly higher during the bloom (155 +/- 12 mu g xanthan gum equiv. L-1) than in the post-bloom phase (90 +/- 32 mu g xanthan gum equiv. L-1). In contrast, bacteria abundance within the mixed layer changed little during the bloom to post-bloom phases. These results suggest that the abundance of phytoplankton greatly contributed to dynamics of the TEP distribution. To evaluate the ability of the phytoplankton to produce TEP, an axenic strain of the diatom Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii, which is a representative species of Oyashio blooms, was examined within a batch culture system. Cell abundance-normalized TEP and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production rates changed simultaneously with growth of the strain. Although these production rates were significantly higher in the stationary phase than in the exponential growth period, values of the TEP/DOC ratio changed little throughout incubation. These findings suggest that TEP production in the Oyashio region may be enhanced by an increase in DOC production from spring diatoms.					; Yamashita, Youhei/A-3858-2012; Suzuki, Koji/A-4349-2013	Suzuki, Koji/0000-0001-5354-1044; Yamashita, Youhei/0000-0002-9415-8743; Nosaka, Yuichi/0000-0003-4573-115X; 														2296-7745					2017	4								79	10.3389/fmars.2017.00079	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2017.00079													WOS:000457690600079

Samples were obtained from a wide variety of environments, including raw sewage, secondary effluent, coagulated effluent, chlorinated and UV-irradiated effluents, river water, coagulated river water, and lake water. The virus concentrations varied widely between 0.001 and 570/liter. The same cell line also supported growth of reoviruses, which were abundant in winter (up to 95% of the viruses detected) and scarce in summer (less than 15%). The concentrations of three groups of model organisms in relation to virus concentrations were also studied. The concentrations of bacteria (thermotolerant coliforms and fecal streptococci) were significantly correlated with virus concentrations in river water and coagulated secondary effluent, but were relatively low in disinfected effluents and relatively high in surface water open to nonhuman fecal pollution. The concentrations of F-specific RNA bacteriophages (FRNA phages) were highly correlated with virus concentrations in all environments studied except raw and biologically treated sewage. Numerical relationships were consistent over the whole range of environments; the regression equations for FRNA phages on viruses in river water and lake water were statistically equivalent. These relationships support the possibility that enteric virus concentrations can be predicted from FRNA phage data.

B.; Agee, James K.; Eglitis, Andris			Effects of Prescribed Burning on Mortality and Resin Defenses in Old Growth Ponderosa Pine (Crater Lake, Oregon): Four Years of Post-Fire Monitoring	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Forests dominated by old growth ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl.) at Crater Lake, Oregon, have been viewed as good candidates for restoration via prescribed burning. Previous burn experiments in this ecosystem observed that ponderosa pine typically survived burning treatments but suffered high post-fire mortality from bark beetle attacks. This paper describes the results of four years of post-fire monitoring of ponderosa pine mortality and resin flow in areas subjected to low intensity spring burning (SB), moderate intensity fall burning (FB), or no burning (unburned controls, UC). Crown vigor estimates, correlated with ring width indices, were also included as a factor in mortality and resin flow analyses. Burn treatment was significant in both ponderosa pine mortality and resin flow, as follows: FB > SB > UC. These results suggest that resin defenses overall did not protect trees from post-fire beetle attacks. Crown vigor was positively related to both survival and resin flow. The relationships between burning, tree vigor, and resin defenses in this study suggest a complex web of interactions. Although some physiological mechanisms are still unconfirmed, these findings suggest that beetles may have been attracted to ponderosa pine following burning, perhaps via the release of volatile resin compounds. Following attraction, resin defenses appear to have been important for protecting trees from beetle attacks, with greater defenses in trees with higher crown vigor and higher growth rates. Management recommendations, including a gradual and incremental approach to fire restoration in these stands, are suggested.					; Perrakis, Daniel/JWO-0884-2024	Perrakis, Daniel/0000-0002-8917-8694; 													0885-8608	2162-4399				JAN	2011	31	1					14	25		10.3375/043.031.0103	http://dx.doi.org/10.3375/043.031.0103													WOS:000286997700003

Water temperatures in 1974-1975 were similar to those previously reported for 1966-1969. However, water transparency has increased, particularly during the spring months. NO3 concentrations have remained unchanged since 1969, and ranged from 2-8 .mu.M between 6 June 1974-22 May 1975. However, NH4 levels were reduced in the winter months when mean concentration was about 1 .mu.M. Dissolved P levels in 1966-1969 were consistently around 3 .mu.M, but never reached 1 .mu.M in 1974. Phytoplankton populations in 1974-1975 (measured as chlorophyll a) were lower than those during the 1966-1969 period, and evidence is presented that suggests that major shifts have occurred in the species composition of the phytoplankton. Whereas Kootenay Lake experienced blue-green and green algal blooms during the 1960''s, no such phenomena were observed in 1974-1975 when the plankton was dominated by diatoms. Population maxima of the 3 most common zooplankters (Cyclops bicuspidatus, Diaptomus ashlandi and Diaphanosoma leuchtenbergianum) have increased since 1966-1969.

These changes in lake ice cover must be understood in terms of resulting effects on lake ecosystems. Accurate predictions of lake ice phenology are essential to assess resulting impact. We applied the one-dimensional physical lake model FLake to analyse past variability in ice cover timing, intensity and duration of Berlin-Brandenburg lakes. The observed ice phenology in two lakes in the period 1961-2007 was reconstructed by FLake reasonably well and with higher accuracy than by state-of-the-art linear regression models. Additional modelling results of FLake for 38 Berlin-Brandenburg lakes, observed in the winter of 2008/09, were quite satisfactory and adequately reproduced the effects of varying lake morphology and trophic state. Observations and model results showed that deeper and clearer lakes had more ice-free winters, later ice cover freezing and earlier ice cover thawing dates, resulting in shorter ice-covered periods and fewer ice-covered days than shallow and less clear lakes. The 1947-2007 model hindcasts were implemented using FLake for eight Berlin-Brandenburg lakes without ice phenology observations. Results demonstrated past trends of later ice start and earlier ice end, shorter ice cover duration and an increase in ice-free winters.

A springtime peak of the phytoplankter Dunaliella viridis is followed by a peak of the sole grazing zooplankter Artemia salina. The annual time patterns of these 2 spp. are analyzed using Forrester''s feedback dynamics methodology. The goal is to obtain a model with coupled feedback loops sufficient to reproduce the major features shown in 3 yr of field data (e.g., spring phytoplankton blooms and crashes followed by zooplankton). Some details are ignored until a sensitivity analysis has revealed important needed information. For example, an average liter of water at an average depth, in a homogeneous lake was considered; only eggs, nauplii and adults were included in the brine shrimp life cycle. Emphasis is given to overall pattern reproduction and model stability. The system is driven by solar energy, but the dynamics arise primarily from the feedback loop structure. Feedback loops included are the life cycles of algae and brine shrimp; algal self-shading; algal grazing by brine shrimp; and brine shrimp starvation. The algae are hypothesized to be limited in spring by self-shading, and then by grazing until the fall disappearance of brine shrimp, when the algae become temperature- and light-limited. Brine shrimp are limited only by food. The model reproduces successfully the major features of the recurring dynamics. Proper scaling of the overall shape may require only the correction of slight errors in the estimates of active parameters. Sensitivity analysis suggests that factors affecting algal productivity, brine shrimp grazing and overwintering-egg dynamics require additional investigation. More intensive model detail in these areas should provide a better fit to the natural-system dynamics, but the major causal forces producing the predator-prey dynamics have been identified.																			0304-3800	1872-7026					1982	17	3-4					243	270		10.1016/0304-3800(82)90034-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800(82)90034-5													WOS:A1982QB49400004

The Red River is more highly saline than the Washita and creates a complex salinity gradient across the reservoir. Populations of chironomids were monitored with multiple-plate samplers in areas of high (34-113 mg l-1 Cl-), intermediate (35-60 mg l-1 Cl-) and low (4-27 mg l-1 Cl-) salinity during the spring and summer of 1978. Food availability, temperature, salinity and wind direction influenced the distribution of the 14 genera and at least 22 spp. of chironomids which colonized the multiple-plate samplers. Filter-feeders attained their highest densities in the river-arm stations in which levels of particulate organic matter (POM) were high. Algal grazers attained their highest densities in the clear intermediate area in which the plates of the samplers were covered with algal mats. Most of the genera believed to be feeding primarily on POM decreased in density as the temperature and density of Glyptotendipes sp. rose. Certain species are restricted to either the Red River arm or the Washita River arm, and this is probably a reflection of different salinity tolerances.

In the Tule Lake basin of northern California populations survived the winter in sharply reduced numbers but did not suffer a drastic crash. From April 1958 onward, despite the resumption of breeding and renewed food and cover, voles in most fields continued to decline to the point of disappearance. Breeding was fairly normal but relatively few young were successfully recruited into the population. Voles in favorable natural habitats reached less extreme numbers and declined more slowly during spring than did those in cultivated fields. Voles in Bridgeport Valley, Mono County, had nearly disappeared by Jan. 20, and were thought to have crashed in the wake of a severe precipitation-freeze episode. Tularemia was found at Tule Lake in Dec. and early Jan., but not in subsequent surveys. Neither the effects of disease nor destruction of food supply were thought to adequately explain the termination of the outbreak. Concepts of reduced viability due to crowding were compatible with observed events.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1965	46	1-2					163	171		10.2307/1935267	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1935267													WOS:A1965CLA4900015

The Indian summer monsoon (ISM) is one of the TPSE's most important moisture sources, and its characteristics are therefore key for precipitation changes. Here we present the ISM activities (ISM onset/retreat date, ISM duration, and ISM intensity) and the percentages of varied moisture sources in TPSE, using OLR datasets and Hysplit modeling with gbl reanalysis. The recent precipitation anomalies in TPSE are analyzed with CMFD reanalysis. Major findings: (1) The ISM in TPSE generally begins later, retreats earlier, is of shorter duration, and weaker in intensity. (2) Uniformly decreasing (increasing) precipitation trends are found in TPSE for periods 1979 - 2018 and 1999 - 2018 (1979 - 1998). (3) Moistures along with the ISM are the primary controls of TPSE precipitation (similar to 85% in summer); these are also verified by the generally same linear trends observed in ISM moistures and TPSE precipitation in summer. (4) The precipitation anomalies in TPSE are closely related with the ISM activities: the ISM onset date (retreat date) and its variabilities affect precipitation during May - June (September - October); precipitation during July - August correlates positively with the ISM duration and its intensity. The ISM activities impact the percentages of ISM moistures and finally affect the precipitation amount and their trends. These results will contribute to precipitation-related studies as hydrology, ecology, and paleoclimate reconstructions in TP.

The anticline comprises of the Asmari Formation which is sandwiched between two impermeable formations, the Pabdeh-Gurpi Formation at the bottom and the Gachsaran Formation at the top. There are several freshwater resources (e.g., spring, lake, qanat, and pumping wells) around this anticline without clear known hydrogeological connection of which to the Anar anticline. The comprehensive hydrogeological studies, including the use of the APLIS method, karst hydrogeology, hydrochemistry, and stable isotopes data of the lakes and surrounding springs, were carried out in the study area. Results show that the anticline has no hydrogeological connection with the Haft Barm Lakes, but hydrogeologically, there is potential for hydraulic connection with the Chehel Cheshmeh Spring. The study shows that the catchment area of the Mashayekh and Deh Gerdoo Springs is located in the northeast and a part of the southwest flank of the Anar anticline. Mean annual recharge rate in the Asmari limestone aquifer is estimated less that 38.5 % based on the APLIS approach that confirmed by water balance.					; Mohammadi, Zargham/AHA-7949-2022	saadat, habib/0000-0002-5722-0691; 													0891-2556	1878-5212				MAR	2018	33	1					29	41		10.1007/s13146-016-0317-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13146-016-0317-2													WOS:000426470400003

We tracked an adult Grey Heron with a GPS/GSM transmitter for two consecutive years (2014-2015) including two complete migrations between Dongting Lake, a wintering area, and the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, a breeding area, along with a post-breeding area in Jiamusi City. We found that the Grey Heron migrated without using stopover sites en route and traveled both by day and night. The home-range size and habitat type used varied between life stages (wintering, breeding, and post-breeding periods), but agricultural habitats were used more in winter. Our study revealed for the first time the detail of the year-round movements and habitat use of the Grey Heron.					; Yu, Hui/IVV-5482-2023; Zhenggang, Xu/ABE-9095-2020; Rotman, Yaara/AAU-8619-2020	Aharon-Rotman, Yaara/0000-0002-2142-2718; Zhenggang, Xu/0000-0002-7401-5163; Yu, Hui/0000-0001-9151-5250; Cao, Lei/0000-0002-1157-0303													1347-0558					JUL	2018	17	2					223	228		10.2326/osj.17.223	http://dx.doi.org/10.2326/osj.17.223													WOS:000440670000011

However, a definitive conclusion has not yet been reached on the multi-scale drought features in Northern China under a warming context. Drought is affected by several circulation-related variables and a deeper scientific comprehension of their synergistic effects is required. This research addresses the spatiotemporal aspects of summer drought and its causes in the northern drought-prone belt of China (NDPB), based on meteorological observation and data reanalysis. The primary findings indicate that the NDPB is very vulnerable to drought, with the uniform mode being the region's most significant spatial mode associated with summer droughts. Inter-annual variations are the primary cause of the summer drought in the NDPB when considering multi-scale changes. Regional drought has typically declined during this century because of the effect of multi-decadal scale changes, which cannot be disregarded. Considering the circulation background field, during summer drought years in the NDPB, the South Asian high is weaker and moves eastward, while the high-level westerly jet is weaker and more northerly. From Lake Baikal to Northern China, there is an anomalous anticyclonic circulation, and the mid-level subtropical high in the western Pacific is more southerly and easterly. As a result, the NDPB is governed by the unusual northerly circulation. The Mongolian and northeastern surface cyclone activity is decreasing, the low-level warm and humid airflow is feeble, and the NDPB is not experiencing anomalous water vapor transport. In the high-, middle-, and low-level arrangement, the NDPB circulations diverge at low levels and converge at high levels-unusual sinking in the vertical field results in regular droughts. Multiple circulation parameters on inter-annual, inter-decadal, and multi-decadal scales interact synergistically to impact summer droughts in NDPB. However, the synergistic elements that mainly impact various timescales differ. They are primarily influenced by northerly circulation, westerly winds, and the combined effect of the South Asian summer monsoon on inter-annual timescales. The combined impact of the upper westerly winds, northerly circulation, and East Asian, South Asian, and plateau summer monsoons significantly influences their inter-decadal timescales. The westerly winds, northerly circulation, and East Asian, plateau summer monsoons are the primary multi-decadal factors.					岳, 平/GWC-4881-2022; Wang, Pengling/B-5991-2017; Qin, Yao/K-6003-2012															2296-665X				AUG 21	2024	12								1464917	10.3389/fenvs.2024.1464917	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2024.1464917													WOS:001303864400001
J	Spak, SN; Holloway, T				Spak, Scott N.; Holloway, Tracey			Seasonality of speciated aerosol transport over the Great Lakes region	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The Community Multiscale Air Quality model (CMAQ) is used to simulate aerosol mass and composition in the Great Lakes region of North America in an annual study for 2002. Model predictions are evaluated against daily and weekly average speciated fine particle (PM2.5) and bulk (PM2.5 and PM10) mass concentration measurements taken throughout the region by the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE), Speciation Trends Network (STN), and Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNet) monitoring networks, and number concentration is evaluated using hourly observations at a rural site. Through detailed evaluation of model-measurement agreement over urban and remote areas, major features of aerosol seasonality are examined. Whereas nitrate (winter maximum) and sulfate (summer maximum) seasonal patterns are driven by climatic influence on aerosol thermodynamics, seasonality of ammonium and organic mass (OM) is driven by emissions. Production of anthropogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and summertime ozone formation both reach regional maxima over the southern Great Lakes, where they are also most strongly temporally correlated. Although primary OM is more prevalent, insufficient SOA formation leads to summertime OM underprediction of more than 50%. By comparing temporal patterns in aerosol species between model and observations, we find that elemental carbon, OM, and PM2.5 are overly correlated in CMAQ, suggesting that the model misses chemical, transport, or emissions processes differentiating these constituents. In contrast, sulfate and PM2.5 are not sufficiently correlated in CMAQ, although CMAQ simulates sulfate with a high level of skill. Performance relative to ad hoc regional modeling goals and previous studies is average to excellent for most species throughout the year, and seasonal patterns are captured.

Winter decomposition activity correlated better with water temperature than with organic C. In winter 1978 the highest value measured for organic C was 9.9 mg/l, at the temperature of 2.8.degree. C. A regression equation used to calculate the theoretical amount of organic C required to consume all the O2 in the water gave 14.9 mg/l at 2.8.degree. C and 13.3 mg/l at 4.0.degree. C. The results for the following winter (1979) suggested that much lower concentrations could cause O2 depletion, since anoxic conditions had apparently arisen at the sediment surface near the fish-breeding pool.																			0003-3847	1797-2442					1979	16	3					176	180																WOS:A1979HW38900004

However, studies of tree crowns and fallen trees, especially on flood inundated areas, remain largely unexplored. Detection of degraded tree trunks on natural environments such as water, mudflats, and natural vegetated areas is challenging due to the mixed colour image backgrounds. In this paper, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, with embedded RGB cameras were used to capture the fallen Acacia Xanthophloea trees from six designated plots around Lake Nakuru, Kenya. Motivated by the need to detect fallen trees around the lake, two well-established deep neural networks, i.e. Faster Region-based Convolution Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) and Retina-Net were used for fallen tree detection. A total of 7,590 annotations of three classes on 256x256 image patches were used for this study. Experimental results show the relevance of deep learning in this context, with Retina-Net model achieving 38.9% precision and 57.9% recall.

J	Berger, J; Krainer, K; Mostler, W				Berger, J; Krainer, K; Mostler, W			Dynamics of an active rock glacier (Otztal Alps, Austria)	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The rock glacier Innere Olgrube, located in a small side valley of the Kauner Valley (Otztal Alps, Austria), consists of two separate, tongue-shaped rock glaciers lying next to each other. Investigations indicate that both rock glaciers contain a core of massive ice. During winter, the temperature at the base of the snow cover (BTS) is significantly lower at the active rock glacier than on permafrost-free ground adjacent to the rock glacier. Discharge is characterized by strong seasonal and diurnal variations, and is strongly controlled by the local weather conditions. Water temperature of the rock glacier springs remains constantly low, mostly below 1degreesC during the whole melt season. The morphology of the rock glaciers and the presence of meltwater lakes in their rooting zones as well as the high surface flow velocities of >1 m/yr point to a glacial origin. The northern rock glacier, which is bounded by lateral moraines, evolved from the debris-covered tongue of a small glacier of the Little Ice Age with its last highstand around A.D. 1850. Due to the global warming in the following decades, the upper parts of the steep and debris-free ice glacier melted, whereas the debris-covered glacier tongue transformed into an active rock glacier. Due to this evolution and due to the downslope movement, the northern rock glacier, although still active, at present is cut off from its ice and debris supply. The southern rock glacier has developed approximately during the same period from a debris-covered cirque glacier at the foot of the Wannetspitze massif. (C) 2004 University of Washington.

Peat biostratigraphy and Holocene climate in the northwestern mountain periphery of Lake Baikal	RUSSIAN GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												We report new radiocarbon ages, pollen stratigraphy, and botanical composition of an organic sediment sequence from mountains along the northwestern side of Lake Baikal. The calendar age of the peat is ca. 9.5 kyr BP. The pollen spectra between 9.5 and 8.5 kyr ago show vegetation consisting mostly of open larch and spruce-larch forests with minor birch. The interval from 7.5 to 6.8 kyr BP is marked by broad fir spread confirmed also by the peat botanical composition. The climate inferred for the period of fir dominance combines mild winters, cool summers, thick snow cover, and abundant moisture, apparently due to more intense North Atlantic air transport. Fir percentages decrease dramatically after 6.8 kyr BP, when pines begin to spread in the Baikal watershed. The peat record bears imprint of North Atlantic cooling events identified as intervals of ice-rafted detritus deposition and low surface water temperatures. The new data allow a better insight into the regional climate and landscapes, and the reliable age model provides regional and inter-regional correlations of global change events.

Multicomponent mineral equilibrium (MME) geo-thermometer calculations at Gisenyi prospects with the highest in situ measured temperature (73.1??C) showed the reservoir temperature of 90??6??C. The MME tempera-ture estimates agreed well with Silica-based, K-Mg and Mg-Li geothermometers while the other cation geother-mometers (Na-K, Na-K-Ca, Na-K-Ca-Mg, and Na-Li) results are unreliable. Most of the non-thermal springs are Ca-Mg-HCO3 water-type while the thermal spring waters were majorly Na-HCO3. The ??D composition varied from-16.6 to-5.9%0 and from-11.8 to-5.0%0, while the ??18O ranged from-4.17 to-3.5%0 and-4.32 to-2.7%0, for ther-mal and non-thermal springs, respectively. All isotopic ratios scattered around the meteoric water lines, thus indicating their similar meteoric origin. In addition, there was no observable ??18O positive shift speculating less extent of water-rock interactions while geogenic CO2 ingress into the waters has been ascertained by both isotopic and chemical component ratios. We proposed a circulation mechanism of the thermal waters for the study area.					ndikubwimana, innocent/KIK-9433-2024														0705-3797					MAR	2022	45	1					73	86		10.18814/epiiugs/2021/021006	http://dx.doi.org/10.18814/epiiugs/2021/021006													WOS:000802284000007

Dynamics of the relative nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in a reservoir situated in a semi-arid zone (Sahela, Morocco)	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Fluctuations in total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations and in the N/P ratio (i.e. in terms of mass) were measured at the entry and exit of the Sahela Reservoir (Morocco) throughout an annual cycle. Particulate N and P concentrations in sedimenting particles in the reservoir itself were also measured. The results obtained showed that the spring floods were a major source of N and P inputs, this being especially pronounced for phosphorus that was present mainly in particulate form. In all the compartments of the reservoir analysed, the N/P ratios were high (means between 81 and 314), especially in summer (the only season when the reservoir was emptied) when the supply of P was apparently limited by the drought. However, the values of this ratio in the sedimenting particles remained lower (mean = 21), at levels characteristic of natural communities. This implies that the reservoir's biological communities preferentially store phosphorus, no doubt to maximise their activity in an environment where a large proportion of this element is not bioavailable. Furthermore, it appeared that the quantity of particulate N and P sequestrated by the sediments and the total quantities of N and P leaving the reservoir were greater than the inputs of these nutrients, underlining the importance of lateral and internal nutrient supplies. One spot measurement, made in a single month, showed that nutrient release activity from the sediments was in fact quite considerable.					; Sime-Ngando, Télesphore/M-4134-2019	Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/0000-0002-7240-5803; 													0920-4741	1573-1650				JUN	2007	21	6					983	995		10.1007/s11269-006-9068-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-006-9068-5													WOS:000246186200005
J	Hall, EK; Cotner, JB				Hall, Edward K.; Cotner, James B.			Interactive effect of temperature and resources on carbon cycling by freshwater bacterioplankton communities	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Planktonic heterotrophic prokaryotes play an essential role in all aquatic ecosystems due to their short generation times and access to dissolved organic carbon and nutrients. In order to understand how rising temperatures and nutrient loading affect the biogeochemistry of whole lake ecosystems, it is essential to understand the interactive effects that temperature and resources have on the metabolism of natural bacterioplankton communities. To address this question we sampled bacterial communities from 1 mesotrophic and 1 oligotrophic lake in Clearwater County, Minnesota, USA, in winter and summer. Each community was exposed to a combination of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus additions at 4 different levels (ambient, 2 x, 5 x, and 10 x ambient) and 4 temperatures (4, 14, 24 and 34 degrees C). Community metabolic response to temperature depended on the resource treatment, and the season when the community was sampled. Bacterial respiration increased more with temperature than bacterial growth, resulting in decreased bacterial growth efficiencies at higher temperatures. This result was most pronounced in the high resource treatments, while at lower resource levels the results were more ambiguous. In addition, differences between seasons and lakes suggested that the bacterial communities had adapted or acclimated to in situ temperature such that communities sampled from cold temperature environments had higher respiration at high temperatures than those sampled from warmer environments. These results suggest that the effect of temperature on carbon cycling mediated by the bacterial community depends on both the in situ resource pool and the extent to which the bacterial community is acclimated to a specific temperature regime.

Benthic larval densities were assessed weekly or biweekly by collecting Ekman dredge (15 .times. 15 cm) samples; prevalence of adults was studied from their weekly accumulations in New Jersey light traps. Eleven spp. of midges were collected; Tanytarsus spp., Chironomus decorus (Johannsen) and Procladius freemani Sublette were quantitatively important. Larvae of Tanytarsus spp. were dominant prevailing at 100-2500/0.09 m2 (= 1 ft2) and were highest in the spring and summer months when as many as 50,000 adults/trap/wk were collected. The seasonal quantitative composition of adult Tanytarsus spp. and Chironomus spp. generally correlated with their prevailing larval numbers, but Procladius spp. did not follow this pattern. Two applications of the insect growth regulator diflubenzuron (25% WP [wettable powder]) at 0.012 ppm during April-Aug. 1977 gave excellent control of the midges for 2-3 wk after each treatment. In laboratory studies, chlorpyrifos was highly toxic to Tanytarsus spp. and C. decorus, was relatively less toxic to P. freemani. Temephos and fenthion were very active against Tanytarsus spp., but temephos was ineffective against P. freemani. Fenthion showed poor activity against C. decorus and P. freemani; malathion also was only slightly toxic to P. freemani. Some new synthetic pyrethroids, exceptionally toxic to Tanytarsus spp. (LC90 values 0.023-0.058 ppb), were also highly active against C. decorus and P. freemani.

J	McDowell, RW				McDowell, Richard W.			Effect of land use and moisture on phosphorus forms in upland stream beds in South Otago, New Zealand	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Land use can influence stream sediment composition and water quality, whereas moisture status affects sediment phosphorus (P) bioavailability to algae. Declining upland surface-water quality in South Otago, New Zealand, may reflect land-use changes from sheep-to dairy-farming. I sampled sediment (0-20 cm) from streams draining 12 dairy- and 12 sheep-farmed catchments in spring (wet) and autumn (dry). P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and the EDTA-fractionation scheme were used to determine different P forms and infer P bioavailability. Significantly more P was present in the sediment of streams draining dairy-than sheep-farmed catchments. Total P did not differ with the moisture regime; however, changes occurred in the following P fractions: acid-soluble organic P, NaOH-P, CaCO3 approximate to P, Fe(OOH)approximate to P and residual organic P. Extraction for P-31 NMR analysis removed 78-85% of sediment total P and isolated five P classes. More bioavailable P such as orthophosphate (23-40% of P extracted) and diesters (2-6% of P extracted) was present in dry than in wet sediments, and in sediments draining dairy streams than in those from sheep-farmed catchments.

J	Klich, M; Lankester, MW; Wu, KW				Klich, M; Lankester, MW; Wu, KW			Spring migratory birds (Aves) extend the northern occurrence of blacklegged tick (Acari: Ixodidae)	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Birds that had migrated northward across Lake Superior were captured upon reaching landfall at Thunder Cape (48 degrees 18' N, 88 degrees 56' W) at the southwestern tip of the Sibley Peninsula, northwestern Ontario, from 9 May to 9 June 1995. Twenty-one of 530 birds examined (6 of 55 species) had a total of 34 ticks; 1 blue jay, Cyanocitta cristata, had a northern fowl mite, Ornithonyssus sylviarum (Canestrini & Fanzago). Four blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis Say, larvae were found on an American robin, Turdus migratorius, and 2 on a chipping sparrow, Spizella passerina. This tick was not found on small mammals at Thunder Cape. Twenty-six larvae and a nymph of the rabbit tick, Haemaphysalis leporispalustris (Packard) were found on 1 American robin, 2 Swainson's thrushes, Catharus ustulatus, 1 whitethroated sparrow, Zonotrichia albicollis, 1 common yellowthroat, Geothlypis trichas, 1 blue jay, and 12 chipping sparrows. A nymph of H. chordeilis (Packard) occurred on 1 chipping sparrow. Results demonstrate that northward migrating birds transport larvae of I. scapularis to areas of Ontario where the tick does not appear to have become established in small mammal populations. Spring migrants may be more involved in the dispersal of I. scapularis larvae than previously thought. Cooler temperatures and shorter seasons experienced in the more northerly, continental parts of the established distribution of this tick may extend the life cycle, resulting in a predominance of larvae rather than nymphs being acquired by northward-bound birds in early spring. Consequently, the role of spring migrating birds in the northward spread of I. scapularis and of borreliosis should be reevaluated.																			0022-2585					JUL	1996	33	4					581	585		10.1093/jmedent/33.4.581	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/33.4.581								8699451					WOS:A1996UT91700010

The literature shows that PCDD/Fs are widespread in various environmental media including air, water, sediment, and soil. PCDD/Fs concentrations in air were relatively low in most regions, with only a few areas considered polluted. Many studies reported seasonal trends, with higher and lower concentrations in winter and summer, respectively. We analyzed the factors affecting the concentrations of dioxins in air and summarized the causes of seasonal changes. As hydrophobic organic compounds, PCDD/Fs readily accumulate in sediments. The distribution of dioxins in sediment in Bohai Sea area was mainly introduced and the factors affecting concentrations of dioxins were studied. The levels of dioxins in soil in different regions varied greatly, with higher levels in areas close to pollution sources. We examined the dioxins concentrations in soil in places where the levels were very low (including the Tibet Plateau and other remote areas), contaminated areas, and other areas. Apart from the contaminated areas, the dioxins concentrations in soil were low. The results of the relatively low number of studies that have investigated PCDD/Fs in water have reported no obvious pollution in some waters, apart from Dongting Lake. PCDD/Fs levels across China are similar to those worldwide. Point sources, mainly related to local geographic, economic, and historical factors, were the most common source of contamination. E-waste dismantling and chemical production has the greatest impact on PCDD/Fs in different media. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Overall, 47% of 339 feeding observations were on carcasses of White-railed Deer ((Odocoileus virginianus), 23% on fish, 11% on other mammal species, 10% on offal and human garbage, and 9% on birds. Only 35% of food items were of aquatic origin. Diet composition varied significantly by region, and eagle age. Garbage and offal formed 39% of feeding observations for immatures, but only 17% for adult eagles. Two-thirds of our observations were in the upper St. Lawrence River. where deer carcasses on the ice accounted for 62% of feeding records. Contaminant exposure could be relatively low for wintering eagles feeding on prey of terrestrial origin compared to those feeding on aquatic mammals, ducks, gulls and fish.																			0008-3550					OCT-DEC	1995	109	4					418	425																WOS:A1995TY60500005
J	Luko, G; Torma, P; Weidinger, T				Luko, Gabriella; Torma, Peter; Weidinger, Tamas			Intra-Seasonal and Intra-Annual Variation of the Latent Heat Flux Transfer Coefficient for a Freshwater Lake	ATMOSPHERE												In the case of lakes, evaporation is one of the most significant losses of water and energy. Based on high-frequency eddy-covariance (EC) measurements between May and September of 2019, the offshore heat and water vapor exchanges are evaluated for the large (600 km(2)) but shallow (3.2 m deep) Lake Balaton (Transdanubian region, Hungary). The role of local driving forces of evaporation in different time scales (from 20 min to one month) is explored, such as water surface and air temperatures, humidity, atmospheric stability, net radiation, and energy budget components. EC-derived water vapor roughness lengths and transfer coefficients (C-q) show an apparent intra-seasonal variation. Different energy balance-based evaporation estimation methods (such as the Priestley-Taylor and the Penman-Monteith) confirm this observation. Furthermore, this has suggested the existence of an intra-annual variation in these parameters. This hypothesis is verified using ten years of water balance measurements, from which, as a first step, evaporation rates and, second, transfer coefficients are derived on a monthly scale. C-q is highly reduced in winter months (1 x 10(-3)) compared to summer months (2.5 x 10(-3)) and strongly correlated with net radiation. The application of time-varying C-q significantly increases the accuracy of evaporation estimation when the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory-based aerodynamic method is applied. The determination coefficient increases to 0.84 compared to 0.52 when a constant C-q is employed.

J	Puckett, NN				Puckett, Neil N.			Combining underwater and terrestrial research approaches in the Great Basin Desert, Walker Lake, Nevada	JOURNAL OF ISLAND & COASTAL ARCHAEOLOGY												Underwater and inundated prehistoric archaeology is usually celebrated because it highlights unique cultural behaviors (e.g., Windover and Old World bogs), preserves organic materials exceptionally well (e.g., Little Salt Springs and Bouldnor Cliff), or identifies early human presence (e.g., Page Ladson and Hoyo Negro). However, as research has progressed, it is increasingly clear that underwater archaeology is an essential tool for understanding how humans adapt to changing landscapes and the water/land boundaries around them. When appropriate, archaeologists should consider the dynamics of changing water levels, where nearby human occupations may preserve, and whether terrestrial or inundated landforms may help answer research questions. In the Great Basin USA, Nevada's Walker Lake is an ideal location for applying this approach. As a lake that has undergone repeated rise and fall over the last 15,000 years, research on human behavior and regional adaptations must consider landforms that have been subject to inundation and are now above and/or below the current waterline. This paper discusses identification and analyses of sites around Walker Lake, investigations revealing intact buried terrestrial landforms under the lake, and how this research provides an improved picture of human behavior and landscape adaptations in the Western Great Basin.

Internal seiche modes and bottom boundary-layer dissipation in a temperate lake from acoustic measurements	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Measurements with Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) and a thermistor string were used to investigate the seasonal variation of internal seiches in a 5-km-long temperate lake and the dissipation induced by the seiches in the bottom boundary layer. Velocity data, from a bottom-mounted 1.2-MHz ADCP were analyzed by cross-spectral analysis to determine the seiche modes. The first vertical mode was generally dominant but the second mode made a significant contribution at times and was present throughout the summer season. The modal periods, which were consistent with normal mode analysis, exhibited a marked seasonal change that correlated closely with the evolution of stratification. Measurements in the bottom boundary layer, by another ADCP, in pulse-pulse coherent-mode sampling at 4 Hz, allowed determination of the rate of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation via the Structure Function Method. Episodes of energy dissipation similar to 10(-7) W kg(-1) occurred during peak flow (similar to 0.05 m s(-1)) in the seiche motion (period, 10 h) and coincided with times of significant Reynolds stress. Between these episodes, dissipation fell below the noise level (similar to 5 x 10(-9) W kg(-1)). The ratio of internal wave energy to the boundary-layer dissipation rate implies a decay time of similar to 75 h, which is similar to that for energy decay in strong seiches, indicating that boundary-layer dissipation makes a substantial contribution to energy loss from seiche motions. A major mixing event in August caused by near-resonant wind forcing brought metalimnion water to the surface and induced substantial mixing.

The walls consisted of transparent polyethylene foil (thickness 0.15 mm) and the bottom was covered by netting of mesh size 7.9 mm. The corrals were supported by oil-spill booms and surrounded by wodden docks. Temperature, oxygen and pH stratifications in the corrals generally mimicked the conditions in the lake in 1979 and 1980, although the thermocline in the corrals was situated slightly closer to the surface. The effect of fish removal on zooplankton community structure and interfering algae (Oscillatoria) was investigated during 1979 and 1980. Juvenile roach (Rutilus rutilus) (mostly of age 2+) equivalent to approx. 230 kg ha-1 were added to one of the enclosures in 1979 and 1000 kg ha-1 in 1980, while there were no fish in the other corral. The absence of fish had apparently no major effect on water chemistry, phytoplankton and zooplankton, and the enclosures closely resembled the lake during autumn 1979. The experiments in 1980, initiated during the spring phytoplankton peak, gave high abundance of carnivorous cyclopoid copepods in the enclosure without fish. This was followed by even lower numbers of efficient filter-feeders than in the lake, in which fish were the main zooplankton predator. As a result, filter-feeders were unable to influence successional patterns and species composition of phytoplankton, even when roach were absent.																			0003-9136					OCT	1987	110	4					533	552																WOS:A1987K740600004

Seasonal and regional variations of metal contamination and condition indicators in yellow perch (Perca flavescens) along two polymetallic gradients.: I.: Factors influencing tissue metal concentrations	HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT												This study examined relationships among water, sediment, diet, and fish tissue metal (Cd, Cu, Ni, Se, and Zn) concentrations in yellow perch from metal gradients in two regions (Sudbury (S), Ontario, and Rouyn-Noranda (RN), Quebec, Canada) in two seasons (spring and summer). The objectives of this study were (1) to examine the influences of aqueous and dietary metal contamination on yellow perch liver and kidney metal accumulation; (2) to compare the seasonal and regional variations in gut content and tissue metal concentrations along the two gradients studied; and (3) to investigate the potential of metals for tissue accumulation under conditions of life-long chronic exposure. Our results suggest a greater aqueous than dietary influence on tissue metal concentrations for all metals examined except Cd, where the opposite was observed. Metals did not accumulate in older fish, except for Cd that accumulated with age in RN, but not S, fish. Regional, but also metal-specific differences in metal handling capacities are proposed. Fish from neither region appeared capable of regulating tissue Cd concentrations, but fish from both regions regulated Zn tightly. Sudbury fish appeared better at regulating tissue Cu, Ni, and perhaps also Se concentrations than RN fish, suggesting acclimation or selection for metal tolerance. There were several significant seasonal effects on tissue metal concentrations. However, close examination of the dataset does not allow proposing the presence of a season-linked mechanism explaining these variations, precluding a modeling approach and implying that repeat sampling within and among years is required for proper ecological risk assessment.

All of the species are new reports for the area, while Cypria sywulae Meisch, 2000 is a new record for the Turkish ostracod fauna. The first 2 axes of canonical correspondence analysis explain 74.1% of the variance between 15 species and 5 environmental variables. The influence of water temperature on species distribution was significantly higher (P = 0.02) than that of the other ecological factors. The most frequently occurring species were clustered into 3 main groups based on their ecological characteristics using unweighted pair group mean averages. Among the species, cosmopolitans showed a tendency to display wide ranges of tolerance values. Cypridopsis vidua (O. F. Muller, 1776) was the only species showing a significant (P = 0.03) negative correlation to habitat type (lentic versus lotic). Our results support the idea that once ecological characteristics of individual species are known, it is possible to use such knowledge in reconstructing past ecological conditions. However, application of this idea may not be limited to local/alpha species diversity. Indeed, our results suggest that studying gamma/regional diversity (Erzincan and environs) allows extending conclusions over a larger geographical scale and wider range of ecosystems.

Moreover, the lake is inhabited by the glacial relict crustacean Mysis relicta, currently found in only three other lakes in Germany. In the present study, the role of M. relicta in the diet of ciscoes was investigated. Between 2001 and 2002 ciscoes, mysids and zooplankton were caught in Lake Breiter Luzin and stomach contents of ciscoes were analysed. There were seasonal changes in the food items in the stomachs, largely reflecting changes in prey availability. The main food items were copepods (45-81%) and mysids (5-26%). Cladocerans had high amounts in the diet only in summer. Seasonal changes in selectivity were also noted for most prey groups. There were also some consistent patterns of prey preference, with an overall preference for mysids. In general, the prey composition in cisco stomachs did not show significant diet changes, but there were some significant differences between day and night feeding in single prey groups, such as cladocerans. Diet composition of ciscoes varied with the different depth strata in which the fish were caught. With increasing depth, the proportion of mysids in the diet significantly increased, whereas that of copepods significantly decreased. Between C. albula and C. lucinensis, no distinct differences in feeding were evident. Mysids provided an additional and important food resource to ciscoes, and were mainly consumed when the availability of other prey organisms decreased, as in autumn and in the deeper strata of the water column. However, mysids preyed on the same food organisms as ciscoes, indicating a strong competition for food between fish and mysids. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

The main cause of severe ice cover over the Bohai Sea was the strong negative AO. Six of seven winters with severe ice were associated with a strong negative AO during the period 1954-2010. The Siberian high (SH) in the 2009/10 winter was close to normal. The influence of El Nino on the Bohai Sea was not significant. In contrast, the mild ice conditions in the Great Lakes were mainly caused by the strong El Nino event. Although the negative AO generally produces significant colder surface air temperature (SAT) and heavy ice cover over the Great Lakes, when it coincided with a strong El Nino event during the 2009/10 winter the El Nino-induced Pacific-North America (PNA)-like pattern dominated the midlatitudes and was responsible for the flattening of the ridge-trough system over North America, leading to warmer-than-normal temperatures and mild ice conditions over the Great Lakes. This comparative study revealed that interannual variability of SAT in North America, including the Great Lakes, is effectively influenced by El Nino events through a PNA or PNA-like pattern whereas the interannual variability of SAT in northeastern China, including the Bohai Sea area, was mainly controlled by AO and SH.					; WANG, DongXiao/B-4445-2012	Wang, Jia/0000-0003-4154-9721; 													1558-8424					SEP	2011	50	9					1922	1935		10.1175/2011JAMC2675.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2011JAMC2675.1													WOS:000295161800011

Plots had been planted with white pine (Pinus strobus L.) and white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) seedlings. Light (PAR), soil moisture and temperature were monitored and recorded throughout the growing season. Forest floor and soil mineral (0-20 cm layer) samples were collected from all experimental plots, except those which had plastic mulching. Foliar samples were collected in autumn and analysed for N, P and K and storage compounds. Seedling mortality was 20 % higher in unscarified plots. Combined silvicultural treatments increased productivity as much as 14 times, but scarification reduced soil carbon and nutrient capital 2-3 fold. Herbicide application reduced soil carbon by at least 20 %. Foliar nutrient, protein, starch and lipid contents in autumn were little affected by treatment.

People living near the shores of this river are frequently exposed to destructive floods that impair local cities and communities. Unfortunately, design flood predictions are hampered by uncertainty since the standard flood records are much shorter than the requested return period and the climate is also expected to change in the coming decades. Here we combine systematic historical and paleo information in an effort to improve flood frequency analysis and better understand potential linkages to both climate and non-climatic forcing. Specifically, we (i) compile historical flood data from the existing literature, (ii) produce high-resolution X-ray fluorescence (XRF), magnetic susceptibility (MS), and computed tomography (CT) scanning data from a sediment core covering the last 10 300 years, and (iii) integrate these data sets in order to better estimate design floods and assess non-stationarities. Based on observations from Lake Flyginnspen, receiving sediments from Glomma only when it reaches a certain threshold, we can estimate flood frequency in a moving window of 50 years across millennia revealing that past flood frequency is non-stationary on different timescales. We observe that periods with increased flood activity (4000-2000 years ago and < 1000 years ago) correspond broadly to intervals with lower than average summer temperatures and glacier growth, whereas intervals with higher than average summer temperatures and receding glaciers overlap with periods of reduced numbers of floods (10 000 to 4000 years ago and 2200 to 1000 years ago). The flood frequency shows significant non-stationarities within periods with increased flood activity, as was the case for the 18th century, including the 1789 CE ("Stor-Ofsen") flood, the largest on record for the last 10 300 years at this site. Using the identified nonstationarities in the paleoflood record allowed us to estimate non-stationary design floods. In particular, we found that the design flood was 23 % higher during the 18th century than today and that long-term trends in flood variability are intrinsically linked to the availability of snow in late spring linking climate change to adjustments in flood frequency.

Temporal structure of the peritrich ciliate assemblage in a large Neotropical lake	ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES												Background: Periphytic communities are usually composed by prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes and small metazoans and could be found in any submerged surface in aquatic environments. Ciliates generally are the dominant organisms in periphytic communities where they can form assemblages of complex taxonomic composition. Among these ciliate taxa, peritrichs are very common organisms found in periphyton; also, they are easy to collect, be easily recognized, and have been widely used to evaluate and monitor ecological and ecotoxicological investigations. Several studies have been focused on periphytic communities in freshwaters from the Northern Hemisphere, with very little data on similar environments in the South. In the present study, we analyzed the structure and temporal dynamics of the ciliate peritrich community in a Neotropical shallow lake, comparing the fluctuation of the peritrich community with environmental factors. Results: Peritrichia comprised a total of 22 morphospecies throughout the year with genera Epistylis and Vorticella the most diverse and abundant genera. Peritrich density was considerably higher during fall and winter, demonstrating a clear seasonal cycle. Small, solitary species showed no pattern of dominance during any particular stage of succession, reaching abundance peak any time during the sampling period. On the other hand, large colonial species were abundant only in the last half of each successional cycle. Species abundance was correlated to temporal and environmental drivers. Conclusion: Our results support the hypothesis of a temporal pattern of succession in the community of peritrich ciliates that composes the periphyton of the studied lake with different responses by individual species to successional time, year, season, and environmental factors.

Sex Differences in Residency of Adult Spotted Seatrout in a Louisiana Estuary	MARINE AND COASTAL FISHERIES												Spotted Seatrout Cynoscion nebulosus is the most highly sought after recreational species along the U.S. Gulf coast. However, movement information for this economically and ecologically important species is currently limited to data from mark-recapture studies. We used remote acoustic telemetry, a high-resolution, fisheries-independent technique, to examine the residency of adult Spotted Seatrout (n = 172) in a Louisiana estuary, Calcasieu Lake (approximate to 300km(2)). An estuarine-wide array of 60 receivers was deployed for a 2.5-year period (May 2007-October 2009) to detect and quantify how long fish were present in the estuary and determine the proportion of fish that emigrated from the system. We then determined how these metrics (detection period and emigration) were related to fish size, sex, and season of release. Emigration was highly seasonal and occurred exclusively during late spring and summer when water temperatures exceeded 24 degrees C. Surprisingly, male Spotted Seatrout, regardless of their size, were more likely than females to permanently emigrate from the estuary (i.e., not return within the 1-year battery life of transmitters) as evidenced by their shorter mean detection periods (males = 134 d, females = 177 d) and higher incidence of emigration (29-42% of males, but only 14-16% of females emigrated). Assessment and management strategies for this species may be improved by explicitly considering this behavioral difference between sexes. Namely, conducting stock assessments at a finer spatial scale (i.e., estuarine-specific versus state-wide) appears warranted given the high estuarine fidelity of females (approximate to 85%), which exacerbates their potential for localized depletions due to anthropogenic stressors (e.g., fishing pressure, habitat alteration, or pollution).																			1942-5120					JAN 1	2013	5	1					79	92		10.1080/19425120.2013.781559	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19425120.2013.781559													WOS:000329369900008
J	Reid, SM; Mandrak, NE				Reid, Scott M.; Mandrak, Nicholas E.			Effect of diel period and season on seining effort required to detect changes in Lake Erie beach fish assemblages	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Using beach seining data from Lake Erie beaches, we examined the effect of diel period and season on two common study objectives considered sensitive to sampling effort: (1) has fish assemblage composition changed between two sampling time periods?, and (2) how many samples are necessary to provide a representative sample of the fish assemblage? Across a range of effect sizes and power levels, sample sizes were estimated for species richness, total fish abundance, round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) abundance and emerald shiner (Notropis atherinoides) abundance. For most sampling periods and effect sizes, several hundred to several thousand seine hauls were estimated to be required for detecting large-scale (e.g. basin-wide) changes in round goby and emerald shiner abundance. Depending on the indicator of interest, night seining (either spring or fall) was interpreted as the most efficient approach. For both seasons, sampling effort beyond 40 to 50 night seine hauls results in few additional species being detected. Both species accumulation curves and estimated sample sizes indicate that less effort is required to detect species richness changes than fish abundance. For most effect sizes and power levels, estimates of the number of seine hauls required to detect changes in fish abundance are unrealistically large for most monitoring programs. More practical monitoring strategies could be achieved by adopting alternative indicators (e.g. guilds), a more liberal significance level (p = 0.1), a paired-site sampling design, or including reference sites.																			0167-6369					JUN	2009	153	1-4					73	82		10.1007/s10661-008-0337-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-008-0337-z								18491208					WOS:000265917200006

The presence of magma volatiles in thermal water serves as a key signal of volcanic activity, making their monitoring crucial. However, other factors such as water-rock interactions can markedly obscure the water chemistry. The hydrogeochemical understanding of each hot spring site is essential in clarifying the source of components in hot springs. Based on the knowledge, the changes sourced from magma volatiles can be identified and help efficient monitoring of volcanic activities. In this study, nine spatially distributed hot spring sites were observed and monitored for 3 years in TVG. The monitored items include pH and major ions SO42-, Cl-, concentrations of total B, Na, Mg, Ca, K, Si, Al, Fe, Sr, Ba, Sigma RFE, along with their ratios (B/Cl-, Cl-/SO42-). Additionally, strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr), hydrogen isotopes (delta 2H), and oxygen isotopes (delta 18O) were also measured, albeit at a lower frequency. Based on the field observation and the comprehensive geochemical observation, we fully discussed the hydrogeochemical characteristics of each hot spring site. Recommendations are provided along with a database of three years' worth of monitoring results, offering valuable information for future monitoring efforts.																			1367-9120	1878-5786				DEC	2025	294								106807	10.1016/j.jseaes.2025.106807	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jseaes.2025.106807		SEP 2025											WOS:001585366500001

High P concentrations originate from external and internal sources. In most Norwegian lakes, agriculture is a main external contributor of P. Two long-term, integrated studies of the relationship between agricultural management, transfer of P and suspended sediments (SS) from agricultural areas and the total P (TP) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations of the receiving lake were carried out in Norway. The Grimestad subcatchment/Aker Lake system (1993-2000) represents a cereal-growing area with mixed livestock production, while the Time subcatchment/Froyland Lake (1986-2000) system represents a grass and dairy cow production system. A comparison of the two systems showed that the mean annual concentration of SS in the Grimestad Stream was 20 times the corresponding concentration in the Time stream. The difference in transparency (secchi depth) of the two lakes reflected this difference. The losses of TP and SS from the Grimestad subcatchment increased significantly during the monitoring period. In the Time stream, there was a significant downward trend in concentrations of TP. Corresponding to the measured inputs, the TP concentration of the Aker Lake (recipient of Grimestad Stream) increased slightly during the monitoring period, while the TP concentration of the Froyland Lake (recipient of Time Stream) showed a slightly decreasing trend. Loads of TP from the Grimestad subcatchment during spring (March-April) described 70% of the variation in TP concentration of the Aker Lake the following summer. The TP concentration in the Time stream in November-December also were correlated (r(2) = 0.6) to the TP concentration in the Froyland Lake the following summer. The annual TP concentrations of the lakes were not very well correlated to the measured Chl-a in the lakes, partly because of bio-manipulation, which was performed in both lakes during the monitoring period.

Quantitative reconstruction of past landscapes from pollen data using the Prentice-Sugita approach requires estimates of fall speed and relative pollen productivity for all taxa modelled. This study presents estimates of pollen productivity and fall speeds for key southern African savanna taxa, providing a basis for the improved interpretation of fossil pollen records from this extensive and heterogeneous biome. The work was carried out in 5 steps. (1) Modern pollen assemblages from 34 surface sediment samples were analysed. (2) Vegetation around each sampling site was surveyed in concentric circles to a radius of 50 m, and data from existing park surveys were analysed to extend the survey distance to 5 km. (3) Fall speeds for the main pollen taxa were estimated using Stoke's Law of particle settling velocity. (4) Vegetation data were weighted using three different distance-weightings, one incorporating the different particle fall speeds. (5) Extended R-Value analysis was carried out on the pollen and distance-weighted plant abundance datasets using HUMPOL software to estimate relevant source area and relative pollen productivity for the main pollen taxa present. Results showed the Relevant Source Area of Pollen surrounding the sites to be 600-900 m radius, and Poaceae/Cyperaceae were found to be twice as productive (PPE 2.03) as the arboreal taxa analysed (PPE 0.50-0.99). The problems encountered in calculating pollen productivity estimates in savanna environments are discussed and improvements for future studies are suggested.					; Bunting, Mairi/I-7191-2013	Bunting, M.

These are characterized by different mean numbers of gill-rakers, mean adult fish length and age at maturity. During summer and autumn, D-whitefish live both in demersal and pelagic habitat. R- and S-whitefish live mainly in the demersal habitat, as do juvenile fish of all morphs. Prior to 1981, the total white fish yield was approximately 0.7 kg ha-1. A commercial pelagic gill-net fishery with bar mesh sizes 35 to 39 mm started in 1981, and by 1982 total yield had increased to about 1.6 kg ha-1. Commercial catches were dominated by D-whitefish. Catch per unit effort (CPUE, no. of fish) of this morph decreased from 10.8 in 1982 to 3.6 in 1984, and stayed around 4 in 1985 and 1986. CPUE of R- and S-whitefish showed no obvious downward trend, but varied between 0.7-2.1, and 0.1-0.3 fish per net night, respectively. The commercial nets were clearly selective, catching more of the larger fish (TL > 35 cm), and fish with the higher condition coefficient in the pelagic stock. As a consequence, the main changes in the pelagic whitefish stock over the sampling period 1982-1986 were reduction in fish size (length and weight), and reduction in the size-at-age of adult pelagic D-whitefish.																			0165-7836	1872-6763				FEB	1989	7	1-2					85	97		10.1016/0165-7836(89)90009-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0165-7836(89)90009-X													WOS:A1989T889500008

The sedimentary record includes one volcanic ash (tephra) layer, which has a completely different composition than the host sediment in terms of organic content, grain size, and mineralogy. According to the geochronology (Pb-210 and Cs-137), this ash layer corresponds to the eruption of Llaima Volcano in 1956-1957. The tephra deposition had an impact on chironomid assemblages producing, among other changes, an increase in Parakiefferiella and a decrease in Ablabesmyia, although no noticeable change was detected in the diversity index. When compared with other studies, our results also show an impact in terms of the presence of chironomid head capsules within the tephra. The presence of these head capsules could result from the effects of percolation, since the coarse grain size of the tephra particles provides large interstitial spaces. The recovery in the abundances of some taxa after the tephra input, suggests the lake is probably restoring the conditions prevailing before the tephra fall.					; Barra, Ricardo O/A-5543-2009; Araneda, Alberto/MAH-3037-2025; Bertrand, Sebastien/G-9744-2011; Barra, Ricardo/A-5543-2009	fagel, nathalie/0000-0002-8231-8295; Barra, Ricardo O/0000-0002-1567-7722; Araneda Castillo, Alberto/0000-0001-8483-6611; Bertrand, Sebastien/0000-0003-0374-4040; 													0716-078X	0717-6317				JUN	2007	80	2					141	156																WOS:000247548600002

This chapter reviews previous studies of the El Chichon volcano-hydrothermal system and proposes a conceptual model of the aquifer structure based on more than 15 years of fluid geochemical monitoring (major and rare-earth elements, delta O-18-delta D, Sr-87/Sr-86). This model contains two aquifers: (1) Aquifer 1, located beneath the crater in the volcanic deposits, produces a total thermal water discharge of 220 L/s and feeds the flank 'Agua Caliente-Agua Tibia' spring group; (2) Aquifer 2, much deeper and with a lower total discharge of 7 L/s, is located in the evaporite-limestone basement and feeds the flank 'Agua Salada-Agua Salada new' spring group. The deep waters from Aquifer 2 have a much higher salinity than Aquifer 1 waters (25,000 vs. 2,200 mg/L Cl) and can be associated with oil-field brines. The crater lake chemistry and dynamics are mainly controlled by the steam condensation from Aquifer 1 waters and by the activity of the Soap Pool springs. Their chemical and isotopic composition can be associated with the volcanic Aquifer 1 water by a model of a single step liquid-vapor separation. Finally, El Chichon volcano is located in a non-classic volcanic arc and rather peculiar local and regional tectonic setting, as supported by CO2 flux surveys and He and C isotope systematics of emitted gases.

Seasonal and interannual variability in the taxonomic composition and production dynamics of phytoplankton assemblages in Crater Lake, Oregon	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Taxonomic composition and production dynamics of phytoplankton assemblages in Crater Lake, Oregon, were examined during time periods between 1984 and 2000. The objectives of the study were (1) to investigate spatial and temporal patterns in species composition, chlorophyll concentration, and primary productivity relative to seasonal patterns of water circulation; (2) to explore relationships between water column chemistry and the taxonomic composition of the phytoplankton; and (3) to determine effects of primary and secondary consumers on the phytoplankton assemblage. An analysis of 690 samples obtained on 50 sampling dates from 14 depths in the water column found a total of 163 phytoplankton taxa, 134 of which were identified to genus and 101 were identified to the species or variety level of classification. Dominant species by density or biovolume included Nitzschia gracilis, Stephanodiscus hantzschii, Ankistrodesmus spiralis, Mougeotia parvula, Dinobryon sertularia, Tribonema affine, Aphanocapsa delicatissima, Synechocystis sp., Gymnodinium inversum, and Peridinium inconspicuum. When the lake was thermally stratified in late summer, some of these species exhibited a stratified vertical distribution in the water column. A cluster analysis of these data also revealed a vertical stratification of the flora from the middle of the summer through the early fall. Multivariate test statistics indicated that there was a significant relationship between the species composition of the phytoplankton and a corresponding set of chemical variables measured for samples from the water column. In this case, concentrations of total phosphorus, ammonia, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and alkalinity were associated with interannual changes in the flora; whereas pH and concentrations of dissolved oxygen, orthophosphate, nitrate, and silicon were more closely related to spatial variation and thermal stratification. The maximum chlorophyll concentration when the lake was thermally stratified in August and September was usually between depths of 100 m and 120 m. In comparison, the depth of maximum primary production ranged from 60 m to 80 m at this time of year. Regression analysis detected a weak negative relationship between chlorophyll concentration and Secchi disk depth, a measure of lake transparency. However, interannual changes in chlorophyll concentration and the species composition of the phytoplankton could not be explained by the removal of the septic field near Rim Village or by patterns of upwelling from the deep lake. An alternative trophic hypothesis proposes that the productivity of Crater Lake is controlled primarily by long-term patterns of climatic change that regulate the supply of allochthonous nutrients.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2007	574						179	204		10.1007/s10750-006-0352-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0352-4													WOS:000242361600011

M.; Hoff, John T.; Wania, Frank			Changes in surface area and concentrations of semivolatile organic contaminants in aging snow	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												During the winter of 1999/2000 five snowpacks at Turkey Lake Watershed east of Lake Superior were sampled immediately after failing and again after several days of aging for the analysis of specific snow surface area and the concentrations of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The snow surface could be determined with a relative coefficient of variation of 6% using frontal chromatography, measuring the retention of ethyl acetate, a substance with known adsorption coefficient on the ice surface. The snow surface area of fresh snow varied from 1000 to 1330 cm(2)/g and was higher for snow failing during colder days. The aged snow samples had consistently lower surface areas ranging from 520 to 780 cm(2)/g, corresponding to an average loss of half of the initial surface area during aging. The rate of loss of surface area was faster at higher temperatures. Dieldrin, alpha-HCH, and gamma-HCH were the most abundant OCPs in snowmelt water, but endosulfan, chlordane-related substances, heptachlor epoxide, pp'-DDT, pp'-DDE, and chlorinated benzenes were also consistently present. Three midwinter snowpacks that aged during relatively cold temperatures generally experienced a loss of PCBs and OCPs that was of the same order of magnitude as the observed loss of snow surface area. However, no relationship between the extent of loss and the strength of a contaminants' sorption to snow was apparent. Few significant changes in snowpack concentrations of OCPs and PCBs were observed in a snowpack that fell at relatively high temperatures and aged under colder conditions. Concentrations of UPS and PCBs increased in a late-winter snowpack that aged while temperatures rapidly increased to above freezing. Concentrations of pp'-DDE and endosulfan-II that increased in snowpacks that saw simultaneous decreases in the levels of pp'-DDT and endosulfan-I hint at the occurrence of sunlight induced conversions in snow. While surface area decreases clearly contribute to the loss of semivolatile organic compounds from metamorphosing snowpacks, other confounding factors play a role in determining concentration changes, in particular in wet snow.

The shallow heat flow and deep temperature distribution are crucial for understanding the process of plate subduction and magma activity. In these areas, the shallow temperature and heat flow fields are strongly disturbed by the bottom water temperature variation (BTV). Thus, its background heat flow needs to be obtained by long-term observation. After a comprehensive analysis of the technical characteristics of the existing long-term seafloor heat flow observation techniques, we proposed a scheme for tethered long-term seafloor heat flow monitoring system (TLHF), and since 2013, carried out a series of pre-developments and tests in the South China Sea, Xingycou Lake, Huguangyan Maar Lake, and Kangding shallow borehole in the Xianshuihe fault zone. The results show: (1) the self-developed long-period and low-power miniature temperature loggers can continuously work for one year in an environment of 2 similar to 36 degrees C. The tethering-type launch and recovery scheme is still feasible even under the conditions of steep terrain, 1.5 knots of velocity and without dynamic positioning. (2) In northern South China Sea, the BTV generally increases as the water depth becomes shallower, whose disturbance to the shallow temperature field cannot be ignored in shallow area. For example, the BTV is only 0.025 similar to 0.053 degrees C during 17 days in Dongsha waters with a depth of 2600 similar to 3200 m but up to 0.182 similar to 0.417 degrees C within 2 days in Xisha waters with a depth of 850 similar to 1200 m. In summer, the seafloor heat flow on the northern slope of the Taixinan Basin (with a water depth of 763 m) from 0.69 W . m(-2) at the shallow surface to -0.25 similar to-0.05 W . m(-2) at a depth of 0.83 m. (3) In Xingycou Lake and Huguangyan Maar Lake, the BTV amplitude gradually decreases and the phase lags during the process of conduction to the deep. That causes the intensity and direction of the heat flow to vary with change of seasons. In Zhonggu Village of Kangding City, the shallow ground temperature is high to 35 similar to 36 degrees C in winter but low to 28 similar to 32 degrees C in summer due to heavy rainfall in summer, and fluctuates synchronously at different depths. The surface heat flow is 0.504 W . m(-2) at the depth of m, and rises to 0.901 W . m(-2) at the depth of m. That indicates the upwelling of thermal fluid from the deep part of the Xianshuihe fault zone. These preliminary work has laid a solid foundation for the development and application of the TLHF system.					zeng, xin/AAR-2909-2020; Pang, Zhonghe/B-3809-2012; guo, xingwei/G-8641-2013; Wang, Yingchun/N-1864-2018; shi, xiaobin/AAD-5273-2019; Wei, Xiaodong/NDT-6124-2025														0001-5733					FEB	2022	65	2					427	447		10.6038/cjg2022P0190	http://dx.doi.org/10.6038/cjg2022P0190													WOS:000776144900002

Urea Fluctuations in Stream Baseflow across Land Cover Gradients and Seasons in a Coastal Plain River System	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Urea-N is a component of bioavailable dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) that contributes to coastal eutrophication. In this study, we assessed urea-N in baseflow across land cover gradients and seasons in the Manokin River Basin on the Delmarva Peninsula. From March 2010 to June 2011, we conducted monthly sampling of 11 streams (4 tidal and 7 nontidal), 2 wastewater treatment plants, an agricultural drainage ditch, and groundwater underlying a cropped field. At each site, we measured urea-N, DON, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), NO3--N, and NH4+-N. In general, urea-N comprised between 1% and 6% of TDN, with the highest urea-N levels in drainage ditches (0.054 mg N/L) and wetland-dominated streams (0.035-0.045 mg N/L). While urea-N did not vary seasonally in tidal rivers, nontidal streams saw distinct urea-N peaks in summer (0.038 mg N/L) that occurred several months after cropland fertilization in spring. Notably, the proportion of wetlands explained 78% of the variance in baseflow urea-N levels across the Manokin watershed. In wetland-dominated basins, we found urea-N was positively related to water temperature and negatively related to DOC:DON ratios, indicating short-term urea-N dynamics at baseflow were more likely influenced by instream and wetland-driven processes than by recent agricultural urea-N inputs. Findings demonstrate important controls of wetlands on baseflow urea-N concentrations in mixed land-use basins.					; Buda, Anthony/ABA-3525-2021; Boyer, Elizabeth/D-6617-2013; Kennedy, Casey/JSK-2720-2023	Boyer, Elizabeth/0000-0003-4369-4201; 													1093-474X	1752-1688				FEB	2019	55	1					228	246		10.1111/1752-1688.12716	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12716													WOS:000457616200015
J	Warren, WJ; Jeter, RM; Kimbrough, RC; Zak, JC				Warren, WJ; Jeter, RM; Kimbrough, RC; Zak, JC			Population patterns and antimicrobial resistance of Aeromonas in urban playa lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY												Bacteria belonging to the genus Aeromonas are indigenous to aquatic environments. Once regarded as unimportant human pathogens, reports of opportunistic infections caused by these organisms have appeared increasingly in the medical literature. To estimate the potential for human infection by Aeromonas where limited water resources are being used intensively, we studied the spatial and temporal variation and incidence of antimicrobial resistance among environmental isolates of Aeromonas from two urban playa lakes in Lubbock, Texas. Aeromonas population densities varied seasonally, with the highest densities occurring from mid-April to late October. The greatest range of densities was 100-fold, from 2.50 to 255.17 colony-forming units per 0.1 mL of water sample. Densities also varied with water depth, although the variation did not display a consistent pattern. One hundred fifty-one Aeromonas isolates were divided into 10 species or subspecies groups by using the BIOLOG identification system. Nine isolates displayed resistance to co-trimoxazole, tetracycline, and cefuroxime, and none was resistant to more than one of these antimicrobial agents. In summary, the results of this study showed that the densities of Aeromonas peak in the late spring and again in late summer, times when human activity around the playa lakes is also high. Thus, we infer that human exposure to these potential pathogens varies seasonally. Compared to other published studies, the incidence of antimicrobial-resistant Aeromonas is relatively low in urban playa lakes in Lubbock, Texas. Nevertheless, resistant organisms were detected.																			0008-4166	1480-3275				JUN	2004	50	6					397	404		10.1139/W04-029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/W04-029								15284885					WOS:000223348900002

Geographic patterns of the climate sensitivity of lakes	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Climate change is a well-recognized threat to lake ecosystems and, although there likely exists geographic variation in the sensitivity of lakes to climate, broad-scale, long-term studies are needed to understand this variation. Further, the potential mediating role of local to regional ecological context on these responses is not well documented. In this study, we examined relationships between climate and water clarity in 365 lakes from 1981 to 2010 in two distinct regions in the northeastern and midwestern United States. We asked (1) How do climate-water-clarity relationships vary across watersheds and between two geographic regions? and (2) Do certain characteristics make some lakes more climate sensitive than others? We found strong differences in climate-water-clarity relationships both within and across the two regions. For example, in the northeastern region, water clarity was often negatively correlated with summer precipitation (median correlation = -0.32, n = 160 lakes), but was not correlated with summer average maximum temperature (median correlation = 0.09, n = 205 lakes). In the midwestern region, water clarity was not related to summer precipitation (median correlation = -0.04), but was often negatively correlated with summer average maximum temperature (median correlation = -0.18). There were few strong relationships between local and sub-regional ecological context and a lake's sensitivity to climate. For example, ecological context variables explained just 16-18% of variation in summer precipitation sensitivity, which was most related to total phosphorus, chlorophyll a, lake depth, and hydrology in both regions. Sensitivity to summer maximum temperature was even less predictable in both regions, with 4% or less of variation explained using all ecological context variables. Overall, we identified differences in the climate sensitivity of lakes across regions and found that local and sub-regional ecological context weakly influences the sensitivity of lakes to climate. Our findings suggest that local to regional drivers may combine to influence the sensitivity of lake ecosystems to climate change, and that sensitivities among lakes are highly variable within and across regions. This variability suggests that lakes are sensitive to different aspects of climate change (temperature vs. precipitation) and that responses of lakes to climate are heterogeneous and complex.

Diversity of anammox bacteria and abundance of functional genes for nitrogen cycling in the rhizosphere of submerged macrophytes in a freshwater lake in summer	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												Purpose Submerged plants make an important contribution to nitrogen cycling in lakes including in the rhizosphere microenvironment through microbial activities. The main objective of this study was to investigate the abundance of functional genes for nitrogen cycling and the ecological relationship between these genes in the rhizosphere sediment of a freshwater lake in summer. Materials and methods Sediment from the rhizosphere of four submerged macrophytes (Ceratophyllum demersum, Hydrilla verticillata, Potamogeton maackianus, and Vallisneria spiralis) was sampled in Lake Liangzi, China, in summer. The anammox bacteria community structure and abundance of five functional genes for nitrogen cycling, ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), anammox 16S rRNA, and nitrite reductase genes (nirK and nirS) in the sampled sediment, were determined. Results and discussion A total of 100 anammox gene sequences were grouped into eight operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and genus Ca. Kuenenia was the dominant species in Lake Liangzi in summer. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) revealed that gene copies of AOA amoA (2.42 x 10(6) copies g(-1)) were more than one order of magnitude higher than those of AOB amoA (1.98 x 10(5) copies g(-1)). The nirS gene (4.13 x 10(8) copies g(-1)) was more abundant than the nirK gene (7.28 x 10(7) copies g(-1)). There was no significant difference in the abundance of the AOB amoA gene among the rhizosphere of the four macrophytes. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed a positive correlation between the abundance of the anammox 16S rRNA gene, AOA amoA and AOB amoA, which suggested two of these microbes may have provided a substrate for anammox bacteria in summer. Conclusions The diversity of anammox in the rhizosphere of submerged macrophytes of the freshwater lake in summer was very low, but the plant species could affect the abundance of most nitrogen circulating bacteria, especially for anammox bacteria. Anammox 16S rRNA gene was positively correlated with four other functional genes, indicating that all four genes had significant effects on anammox bacteria.

Distribution of Crenarchaeota Representatives in Terrestrial Hot Springs of Russia and Iceland	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Culture-independent (PCR with Crenarchaeota-specific primers and subsequent denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) and culture-dependent approaches were used to study the diversity of Crenarchaeota in terrestrial hot springs of the Kamchatka Peninsula and the Lake Baikal region (Russia) and of Iceland. Among the phylotypes detected there were relatives of both cultured (mainly hyperthermophilic) and uncultured Crenarchaeota. It was found that there is a large and diverse group of uncultured Crenarchaeota that inhabit terrestrial hot springs with moderate temperatures (55 to 70 degrees C). Two of the lineages of this group were given phenotypic characterization, one as a result of cultivation in an enrichment culture and another one after isolation of a pure culture, "Fervidococcus fontis," which proved to be a moderately thermophilic, neutrophilic (optimum pH of 6.0 to 7.5), anaerobic organotroph.

For example, ascending temperatures induce an increase in cyprinid fish metabolism and swimming ability. Spring upstream migrations driven by the search for resources may be related to these increases. Conversely, downstream migrations in autumn follow a decrease in temperature. When fish migrations are driven by a search for resources, for example, food availability and reproduction, or to avoid predators, then the temperature effect can be reduced to approximately the threshold temperatures that induce up- and/or downstream movement. To test this assumption, we tracked the seasonal migrations of the common bream Abramis brama between a reservoir and its tributary using radio tags with temperature sensors during a 5-year period. Upstream migrations of the species into the tributary were not motivated by seeking temperatures different from those in the reservoir, that is, fish body temperatures in both environments were comparable across seasons. However, for long-distance migrations, increasing temperature did support upstream migrations. Temperature did not determine the direction or intensity of short-distance migration of the species between the reservoir and the tributary. No significant influence of temperature was recorded for the downstream migrations according to the results of the generalised additive mixed model (GAMM1), which related movement distance as the explanatory variable to the signed fish body temperature as the response. The second model (GAMM2) relating fish body temperature as the explanatory variable to the signed movement distance as the response obtained a threshold value of 19.1 degrees C for the upstream migrations and 1.5 degrees C for the downstream migrations of the common bream.

Through polder construction and aquaculture activities, paddy fields and aquaculture ponds have decreased the lateral connectivity of water level fluctuations in the lake. However, the impacts of water level fluctuations on habitat suitability, which can be seen using high-resolution images analysis, often cannot separate disturbances caused by the paddy fields and aquaculture ponds, and it is difficult to capture the actual impact of water level fluctuations on wetland habitats. Based on remote sensing image data and hydrological data, we selected Caizi Lake as a study site and comparatively analyzed the changes in wintering waterbird habitats in a water level sequence under the two scenarios. Our work showed that paddy fields and aquaculture ponds should be considered as potential options for creating more suitable habitats for migratory waterbirds if combined with reasonable and effective management of the water level within the paddy fields and aquaculture ponds. The present study results could facilitate the management and sustainable utilization of Caizi Lake wetlands and provide support for creating small habitats by managing the water levels of paddy fields and aquaculture ponds.

J	GARDARSSON, A				GARDARSSON, A			WATERFOWL POPULATIONS OF LAKE MYVATN AND RECENT CHANGES IN NUMBERS AND FOOD-HABITS	OIKOS												Waterfowl populations of Lake Myvatn, Iceland, were estimated in 1975-1976. Fifteen duck species bred. The most abundant breeding species were Aythya fuligula (about 3000 .male..male.), A. marila (1700) and Bucephala islandica (700). These species produced about 0.7 fledged young/female in 1975 and about 1.9 in 1976. The difference in production was associated with weather. Males of Anas strepera, A. penelope, A. fuligula, A. marila, B. islandica and Mergus serrator from large areas in North Iceland molted at Myvatn as did about 500-600 non-breeding Cygnus cygnus. Comparison of molting numbers with spring censuses in the presumed areas of origin of the molters suggests that spring censuses were highly accurate for diving ducks but relatively inefficient for Anas spp. Wintering waterfowl were mainly B. islandica (> 1000) and smaller numbers of Mergus merganser, Anas platyrhynchos and C. cygnus. Diving ducks probably removed about 1.5-2 g dry wt m-2 yr-1 invertebrate food from Myvatn and other lentic waters in the basin and about 10-15 g in the upper Laxa river. Densities of breeding ducks were similar at Myvatn (about 125 pairs km-2 water) to other shallow lakes in the region; they were lower than on the Laxa (223) but much higher than in West Iceland (27). Breeding populations of A. marila, Melanitta nigra and Clangula hyemalis have decreased in recent decades. Their decline is associated with changes in food availability. Eurycercus lamellatus (Cladocera) was the preferred food of the ducklings but it declined between the B. islandica population remained unchanged from 1960-1976; A. fuligula and M. serrator may have increased. The food of these 3 spp. did not change. The diverse waterfowl populations are probably maintained by long-term temporal heterogeneity, in addition to short-term of spatial heterogeneity.

The distance between the paired birds while feeding was grouped into three categories: <1 m, 1-3 to and >3 m. Nearly 90% of the distances recorded between paired males and females were within three meters. The degree of vigilance increased with distance apart for females, but not for males. The scanning rate of males was significantly, higher than that of females at <1 m and at 1-3 m respectively, but no significant difference occurred when the distance between them was >3 m. These results are discussed in relation to mate competition and wintering strategy; it is suggested that staving close together is the optimal strategy for members of Ruddy Shelduck pairs.

J	ROSSI, GE; MUNTAU, H; TARTARI, G				ROSSI, GE; MUNTAU, H; TARTARI, G			THE EVOLUTION OF COPPER CONCENTRATIONS IN LAKE ORTA, ITALY	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Experimental results from a triennial sampling campaign (1986-1989) in Lake Orta (northern Italy) were analysed to define the state of lake pollution with respect to total Cu concentration, as determined by the "residual" Cu load before water acidity neutralization (liming) experiments in 1989 and 1990. The model's framework consists of a system of two linear differential equations with constant coefficients, complemented by a computer program to solve the equations numerically in the case when the time dependence of the coefficients must be taken into account. It is applied to both the lake-sediment and to the epilimnion-hypolimnion system. On the basis of an assessed Cu mean residence time in the lake of approximately 5 years, the total Cu concentration in equilibrium with the residual Cu load is approximately 33 mg Cu m-3 ("pre-liming" Cu concentration, approximately 38 mg m-3). The effect of possible internal Cu loading is shown to be negligible, while the annual evolution of the metal distribution coefficient, suspended matter concentration and mixing coefficient is shown to make the epilimnetic Cu concentration oscillate between a summer and a winter value. Finally, the short-term effect of epilimnetic water acidity neutralization is briefly discussed.																			0304-3800					OCT 15	1992	64	1					23	45		10.1016/0304-3800(92)90048-J	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800(92)90048-J													WOS:A1992JV48700003

The total concentrations of the PFASs in the water and sediment of Yangtze River ranged from 2.2 to 74.56 ng/L and 0.05 to 1.44 ng/g dry weights (dw), respectively. The PFAS concentrations were correlated to some selected water quality parameters such as pH, total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN) and conductivity in water, and some sediment properties, such as total organic carbon (TOC), TP, and TN in sediment. The monitoring results for the water and sediment samples showed no obvious seasonal variations. Among the selected 18 PFASs, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was the dominant PFAS compound found both in water and sediment for the two seasons with its maximum concentration of 18.03 ng/L in water and 0.72 ng/g in sediment, followed by perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) with its maximum concentration of 41.9 ng/L in water in Wuhan, whereas the lowest concentrations of PFASs were observed at Poyang lake. The annual loadings of PFOA, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), PFBS, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and the total PFASs in the Yangtze River were 6.8 tons, 2.2 tons, 8.2 tons, 0.88 tons, and 20.7 tons, respectively. Wuhan and Er'zhou of Hubei contributed the most amounts of PFASs into the Yangtze River. A correlation was found between some PFASs, for example PFBS and PFOS, which suggests that both of these PFASs originate from common sources in the region. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Stepanauskas, R; Laudon, H; Jorgensen, NOG				Stepanauskas, R; Laudon, H; Jorgensen, NOG			High DON bioavailability in boreal streams during a spring flood	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Riverine inputs of nitrogen is an important factor that controls productivity of coastal marine waters. Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) comprises most of the N in boreal rivers. During spring floods, DON flux may exceed the baseflow flux by several orders of magnitude. However, little is known about the biological availability of spring flood DON and, thus, its potential effect on coastal productivity. We have investigated the dynamics of DON bioavailability and chemical composition during a spring flood in two streams in northern Sweden. Potential bioavailability was determined by employing bacterial regrowth bioassays with brackish medium and a coastal bacterial inoculum. In addition, concentrations of urea and amino acids and the proportion of D-isomers in fetal dissolved amino acids were analyzed because a high proportion of D-isomers is suggested to indicate old and refractory organic material. During the flood, potential DON bioavailability increased from 19-28% at baseflow to 55-45% during peak how in the two streams, while DON concentration remained relatively constant. At the end of the hood, bioavailability returned to the baseflow values. Potential DON bioavailability was positively correlated with the concentration of dissolved combined amino acids and the proportion of L-enantiomers of amino acids. However only 5-18% of DON was identified as urea and free and combined amino acids, suggesting that bacteria also utilized other DON compounds. Our results imply that a major portion of the annual export of labile nitrogen occurred during a few weeks of spring flood.

LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Freshwater dinoflagellates may form dense blooms during winter in ice-covered lakes. Unlike their marine counterparts, freshwater dinoflagellates are rarely considered to be potential toxin producers. Here we tested whether the winter species Peridinium aciculiferum produces a toxin(s) and investigated the potential adaptive function of that toxin, i.e., predator defense or inhibition of competitors (allelopathy). Using traditional toxicity bioassays (Artemia toxicity test and hemolytic activity assay). we detected the production of a toxic substance by P. aciculiferum cells from both the field and from laboratory cultures. Cultures deprived of phosphorus and in stationary phase showed highest toxicity. Potential predators, such as Daphnia galeata (Cladocera) and Eudiaptomus graciloides (Copepoda), were apparently not harmed by P. aciculiferum toxicity. However, the naturally coaccurring competitor Rhodomonas lacustris (Cryptophyceae) was killed by P. aciculiferum. An allelopathic substance(s) caused the cells of R. lacustris to form blisters and subsequently lyse. We concluded that our results support the hypothesis that P. aciculiferum is allelopathic, but not that toxins serve as predator defense. We therefore suggest that allelopathy may be an adaptive strategy of winter dinoflagellates, which could allow them to outcompete other phytoplankton species and thereby dominate the algal biomass.					; Rengefors, Karin/K-5873-2019	Legrand, Catherine/0000-0001-7155-3604; Rengefors, Karin/0000-0001-6297-9734													0024-3590	1939-5590				DEC	2001	46	8					1990	1997		10.4319/lo.2001.46.8.1990	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2001.46.8.1990													WOS:000172466500013

Great Lakes coastal wetlands as suitable habitat for invasive mute swans in Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Great Lakes coastal wetlands provide critical habitat and food resources for more species than any other Great Lakes ecosystem. Due to past and current anthropogenic disturbances, coastal wetland area has been reduced by >50% while remaining habitat is frequently degraded. Invasive mute swans have contributed to the degradation of coastal wetlands by removing submergent vegetation and competitively excluding native species from breeding areas and food resources. Despite current control practices, mute swan population estimates in Michigan are similar to 8000, comparable to population estimates in the entire Atlantic Flyway of North America. We collected local abiotic data and adjacent land cover data at 3 scales from 51 sites during 2010 and 2011 and conducted 2 mute swan detection surveys each year during the summer and fall. We developed a single-species, single-season occupancy-based habitat suitability model to determine current and potential mute swan habitat among Great Lakes coastal wetlands. We found mute swans occupied heterotrophic coastal wetlands adjacent to urban areas, which were high in ammonium and oxidation-reduction potential and low in nitrates, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity. Our model provides managers with a valuable tool for rapidly identifying mute swan habitat areas for control efforts, particularly the need for targeting mute swan populations in or near urbanized areas. Our model will also aid managers in monitoring areas that mute swans may invade and prioritizing coastal wetland areas for restoration efforts.

In Atlantic Canada, despite an increase of cyanobacterial blooms in the last decade, little is known about the toxigenic potential and the taxonomic affiliation of bloom-forming cyanobacteria. In this study, we employed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and metagenomic approaches to assess the potential for cyanotoxin and other bioactive metabolite production in Harvey Lake (oligotrophic) and Washademoak Lake (mesotrophic) in New Brunswick, Canada, during summer and early fall months. The PCR survey detected the potential for microcystin (hepatotoxin) and anatoxin-a (neurotoxin) production in both lakes, despite a cyanobacterial bloom only being visible in Washademoak. Genus-specific PCR associated microcystin production potential with the presence of Microcystis in both lakes. The metagenomic strategy provided insight into temporal variations in the microbial communities of both lakes. It also permitted the recovery of a near-complete Microcystis aeruginosa genome with the genetic complement to produce microcystin and other bioactive metabolites such as piricyclamide, micropeptin/cyanopeptolin, and aeruginosin. Our approaches demonstrate the potential for production of a diverse complement of bioactive compounds and establish important baseline data for future studies of understudied lakes, which are frequently affected by cyanobacterial blooms.

The goal of this study is to detect seepage locations in the embankment dam for remediation purposes and map bedrock location across the area using nondestructive geophysical measurements. Surveys were completed along the crest and downstream toe of the dam to map subsurface conditions with a focus on seepage detection. The seismic surface wave data were analyzed using two different methods: Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) and Full Waveform Inversion (FWI). Both MASW and FWI methods were shown to be capable of resolving the bedrock layer below the dam, but the FWI method, provided a higher resolution image of the subsurface conditions compared to MASW method. However, the MASW and FWI provided little guidance regarding the seepage path through the dam. The CCR and ERT surveys, on the other hand, were shown to be very valuable for seepage detection. The seepage paths of the embankment dam were detected by comparing the resistivity measurements acquired in a wet winter and a dry summer. These seepage regions correspond well with previous sinkholes observed in the pool area following a drought. Additionally, new drilling in the two regions which showed differences in resistivity indicated the areas contained highly fractured limestone with evidence of solution cavities. It seems that the highly fractured limestone becomes fully saturated during the wet season causing very low resistivity values for these layers in wet seasons, but it quickly loses the water during the dry season leading to a highly resistive material in dry seasons. Therefore, seasonal resistivity measurements can be considered as a useful method for locating potential weak zones of earthen hydraulic structures in a cost-effective and timely manner.

Fluid Mechanics of the Dead Sea	ANNUAL REVIEW OF FLUID MECHANICS												The environmental setting of the Dead Sea combines several aspects whose interplay creates flow phenomena and transport processes that cannot be observed anywhere else on Earth. As a terminal lake with a rapidly declining surface level, the Dead Sea has a salinity that is close to saturation, so that the buoyancy-driven flows common in lakes are coupled to precipitation and dissolution, and large amounts of salt are being deposited year-round. The Dead Sea is the only hypersaline lake deep enough to form a thermohaline stratification during the summer, which gives rise to descending supersaturated dissolved-salt fingers that precipitate halite particles. In contrast, during the winter the entire supersaturated, well-mixed water column produces halite. The rapid lake level decline of O(1 m/year) exposes vast areas of newly formed beach every year, which exhibit deep incisions from streams. Taken together, these phenomena provide insight into the enigmatic salt giants observed in the Earth's geological record and offer lessons regarding the stability, erosion, and protection of arid coastlines under sea level change.

An understanding of biofilm adsorption property is therefore essential to predict how biofilm contributes to mobility and bioavailability of pollutant ions in the environments. The aim of this study is investigating adsorption properties of biofilm, i.e., existing in the biofilm polymer and clarifying the ability of biofilm as an adsorbent in the biosorption of pollutant ions. The biofilms applied in this study are natural biofilms formed on the surface of stones collected from Lake Biwa. The characterization of the biofilm polymer is revealed by electrophoretic mobility measurements and acid-base titrations. To clarify the ability of biofilm for biosorption of pollutant ions, we study the adsorption kinetics of lithium ion to biofilms formed in winter and spring. The followings are observed as results of this study: 1) both negative and positive charged sites exist on biofilm polymer; 2) the ion adsorption by biofilm polymer is a physicochemical process where the electrostatic interaction between ion and the charged sites in biofilm polymers is a main driving force; 3) the adsorbing ion promotes ions desorption from biofilms through ion exchange mechanism; 4) the biofilms components change seasonally and appear to affect the ability of biofilms to adsorb ions. From all of similar studies, this study is the first one investigating utilization of natural biofilms formed in different seasons for biosorption of heavy metal ion i.e., lithium ion. This study also reveals that biofilm may become a promising adsorbent for pollutant ions. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Aquatic connectivity and fish metacommunities in wetlands of the lower Great Lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Although many local and regional variables structure fish assemblage composition, few studies have assessed the effects of aquatic connectivity on fish assemblages in wetlands. Fish and habitat surveys were conducted in 12 wetlands across the lower Great Lakes basin in the spring and fall of 2003 and 2004. Spatial and temporal connectivity were classified into four connectivity classes to evaluate the interaction between aquatic connectivity and fish assemblage structure. Sequential, nested analysis of covariance was used to model the effect of habitat area and connectivity at long- and short-term time scales on aggregate descriptors of assemblage structure (i.e., species richness, piscivore richness, abundance, and diversity). Although no species-area relationship was detected, increases in connectivity were shown to positively affect species richness and piscivore richness. A variation decomposition method indicated that a combination of aquatic connectivity, followed by environmental and area variables, was most influential in structuring fish assemblages at short-term time scales. Connectivity thus influences both the local species pool present, as well as the abundance of these species within a wetland. Future fundamental and applied studies (e.g., climate change predictions, impact of humans on water budget, wetland management) on wetland fish assemblages should include connectivity as an important structuring process.

Monthly sediment samples in 2009 ending in October, together with the samples from different seasons (May, July, October, and December) in 2008, were collected at 6 sites in a Chinese large shallow eutrophic lake (Lake Taihu). The sediment OPB numbers ranged from 2.2 x 10(6) to 1.79 x 10(8) cells g(-1) (dry weight) at different sampling sites and in different seasons, with the average being 3.88 x 10(7) cells g(-1) (dry weight). Its number was highest at the most polluted site and peaked in spring and summer, which can be explained by the enrichment of organic matter in sediment. Furthermore, there existed a significant positive relationship between the OPB numbers and alkaline phosphatase activities in the sediment. The 6 OPB strains isolated from the sediment were distinct in terms of their colony morphology on the yolk agar, biochemical characteristics and phosphorus release abilities. According to the 16S rDNA sequences, these OPB belong to Bacillus cereus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Stenotrophomonas sp., Bacillus cereus, Xanthomonas sp., Pseudomonas sp. They were distinguished from the OPB species recorded in a Chinese small shallow eutrophic lake whose sediment organic content was remarkably higher. Taken together, organic matter shaped the OPB community not only quantitatively but also qualitatively, which in concert facilitated the enzymatic hydrolysis of organic phosphorus in lake sediment.																			0149-0451	1521-0529					2011	28	8					660	666		10.1080/01490451.2010.511438	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490451.2010.511438													WOS:000297016800002

One of the valuable elements of such areas may be water reservoirs and their accompanying springs. An example of such a recreational area is the so-called Palowice Lake District (southern Poland), which includes three water reservoirs, ten breeding ponds and two springs from which water is taken. Water from the springs is considered to be of very good quality and is regularly consumed by residents of nearby towns as well as tourists. The quality of these waters is influenced by natural factors such as weathering of rocks, evapotranspiration, atmospheric deposition, climate change, but also by anthropogenic factors such as industrial effluents, domestic activities, tourist traffic and agricultural activities. However, the results of research conducted in the area of the springs indicate the presence of E. coli and enterococci in the water. The latter are characterized by longer survival in water. Consuming such water may lead to the development of numerous digestive system diseases, hence the issue of protecting water resources in urbanized areas, including conducting representative monitoring of the quality of these waters, is extremely important.

Past mean July air temperatures at the study site and hypolimnetic oxygen contents of the lake water were inferred from chironomid-based transfer functions. The early Holocene (c. 10 100 - 8400 cal. yr BP) is characterized by summer temperatures and hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations broadly similar to present-day conditions. The midge records give evidence of a lake- level fall at c. 7000 cal. yr BP, resulting in weakened thermal stratification of the lake water, and improvement of the hypolimnetic oxygen conditions. After c. 4000 cal. yr BP midge assemblages suggest a lake- level rise related to increased effective moisture. A secondary mid-Holocene climatic optimum with inferred mean July air temperatures of c. 12.1 degrees C was recorded between 6000 and 4400 cal. yr BP, followed by minimum values (c. 11.3 degrees C) between 3500 and 1500 cal. yr BP, accompanied by the onset of natural acidification of the lake. The late-Holocene midge assemblages suggest weakly acidic conditions, low hypolimnetic oxygen contents and a general warming trend during the last c. 1500 years, although paludification and natural acidification may have influenced the temperature reconstruction at this stage. However, the modern chironomid-inferred mean July air temperature (12.5 degrees C) is consistent with meteorological data from a nearby station. In general, the midge records reflect relatively warm and moist conditions at Lake Berkut before c. 7000 cal. yr BP, a relatively warm and dry climate at c. 7000 - 4000 cal. yr BP, and a shift to cooler and wetter climatic conditions in the region after c. 4000 cal. yr BP.

Internal Loads of Nutrients in Lake Chaohu of China: Implications for lake Eutrophication	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												This study investigated the impact of internal nitrogen and phosphorus loading on water quality of Lake Chaohu, China. Results showed that the overall mean concentration of TN and TP in lake water was 1.09 +/- 0.84 and 0.15 +/- 0.84 (SD) mg/L, respectively, indicating Lake Chaohu was highly eutrophic during the study period. Mean benthic flux of NH4+, NO3-, and PO43- were 3.56 +/- 1.52 mg N/m(2)/d, -0.14 +/- 0.40 mg N/m(2)/d, and -1.54 +/- 21.94 mu g P/m(2)/d in summer and were 3.16 +/- 1.83 mg N/m(2)/d, -0.03 +/- 0.30 mg N/m(2)/d, and -0.11 +/- 2.58 mu g P/m(2)/d in fall, respectively. In this study, lake sediments acted as both a source of NH4+ and a sink of PO43-. A scenario was used to understand the role of sediments on lake water quality. Results showed that Lake Chaohu would be eutrophic within a month under the impact of internal NH4+ loading when water was diverted to the lake. This indicates that an integrated project combining both a diversion project and dredging of sediments would be necessary for future lake restoration.

J	Strandberg, R; Alerstam, T				Strandberg, Roine; Alerstam, Thomas			The strategy of fly-and-forage migration, illustrated for the osprey (Pandion haliaetus)	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY												Migrating birds often alternate between flight steps, when distance is covered and energy consumed, and stopover periods, when energy reserves are restored. An alternative strategy is fly-and-forage migration, useful mainly for birds that hunt or locate their prey in flight, and thus, enables birds to combine foraging with covering migration distance. The favourability of this strategy in comparison with the traditional stopover strategy depends on costs of reduced effective travel speed and benefits of offsetting energy consumption during migration flights. Evaluating these cost-benefit effects, we predict that fly-and-forage migration is favourable under many conditions (increasing total migration speed), both as a pure strategy and in combination with stopover behaviour. We used the osprey (Pandion haliaetus) as test case for investigating the importance of this strategy during spring and autumn migration at a lake in southern Sweden. The majority, 78%, of passing ospreys behaved according to the fly-and-forage migration strategy by deviating from their migratory track to visit or forage at the lake, while 12% migrated past the lake without response, and 10% made stopovers at the lake. Foraging success of passing ospreys was almost as good as for birds on stopover. Timing of foraging demonstrated that the birds adopted a genuine fly-and-forage strategy rather than intensified foraging before and after the daily travelling period. We predict that fly-and-forage migration is widely used and important among many species besides the osprey, and the exploration of its occurrence and consequences will be a challenging task in the field of optimal migration.																			0340-5443					OCT	2007	61	12					1865	1875		10.1007/s00265-007-0426-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-007-0426-y													WOS:000249401700007

In July 1974, the grassland had the highest productivity among understory vegetations (228 +/- 55 kg ha(-1): mean +/- SE). In deciduous forests, palatable plants occupied only 0.1% of the biomass of 0.872 +/- 0.366 kg ha(-1), and deciduous leaves within the reach of deer (=220 cm at height) produced 0.208 +/- 0.070 kg ha(-1). However, litterfall during this period had the highest productivity, 28.7 +/- 5.3 kg ha(-1). The deer consumed litterfall (75.6% in dry weight), short grasses (17.2%), deciduous forest understory (4.1%), deciduous leaves within the reach of deer (3.0%) and conifer plantation under story (0.1%). It is suggested that the high-density deer population would be maintained by litterfall through the year instead of browsing in deciduous forests, which has been overlooked.

Such changes in boreal forest ecosystems can persist over decadal time scales or longer. In the ecotone between boreal forest and steppe in the region southeast of Lake Baikal in southern Siberia, shifts between the two vegetation types may be precipitated by variations in site specific conditions, as well as disturbance characteristics such as fire frequency and severity. Warmer, drier conditions in the region have been associated with a decrease in fire return intervals and greater burn severity that may, in turn, drive conversion of forests to steppe vegetation at a greater rate than has occurred prior to the onset of warming and drying. Stand-replacing fires in Pinus sylvestris stands in southern Siberia may lead to recruitment failure postfire, particularly on southwest to west-facing slopes, which are more often dominated by grasses. This study uses a combination of field data and remotely sensed indices of vegetation and moisture to distinguish between recruitment pathways in southern Siberia, and to study the influence of factors related to soils, topography, fire severity and winter snow cover on these. We expected that recruitment success would be associated with lower burn severity (higher NBR), higher greenness (NDVI) and moisture (NDMI), and winter snow (NDSI) postfire. We also expected phenological characteristics to differ among recruitment paths. Prior to burning, our sites are broadly similar in terms of remotely sensed indices of moisture (NDMI), vegetation (NDVI), and winter fractional snow cover (NDSI), but recruitment failure sites are generally drier and less green postfire. Initial differences in greenness and moisture among sites characterized by abundant recruitment (AR), intermediate recruitment (IR) and recruitment failure (RF) become more pronounced over the initial decades postfire. The earliest separability of AR and RF sites using remotely sensed indices occurs in the winter months 3-4 years postfire, during which time NDSI is highest for AR sites and lowest for RF. Although seasonality was important with regard to distinguishing among AR, IR and RF index values, the timing of phenological events such as start and end of season did not differ significantly among the sites.

Whether the Caisang Lake still maintains populations of wintering waterbirds is of great concern. Here, we compare the changes in waterbird populations before and after habitat alterations in Caisang Lake and assess the driving factors leading to the dramatic changes in waterbird populations. Results indicate that wintering waterbird populations were significantly impacted by altered forage availability, with species-and guild-specific responses. Dramatic habitat alterations from planting lotus caused significant declines in areas of native vegetation, mudflats, and water that may have caused associated declines in herbivores, insectivores, and fish-eating waterbirds, respectively. In contrast, the increased size of the lotus area appears to have led to an increase in omnivorous waterbirds. A food shortage, potentially caused by a large area of Caisang Lake being used for culturing crab, might be another cause of the observed decline in fish-eating waterbirds. This study demonstrates a powerful approach to systematically evaluate waterbird responses to wetland management policies. These findings are important as efforts are made to protect the wintering waterbirds from the effects of human intervention, particularly at other Ramsar wetlands.

J	Hoffsten, PO				Hoffsten, PO			Effects of an extraordinarily harsh winter on macroinvertebrates and fish in boreal streams	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Trout density and macroinvertebrate species richness, community structure and abundance were studied before and after an extraordinarily harsh winter with low temperatures and thin snow cover, in nine medium-sized streams in central Sweden. Reductions in trout density (77 %), macroinvertebrate abundance (44 %) and taxonomic richness (43 %) were documented. Large reductions were recorded in most taxa, but with blackflies, Orthocladiinae and Lepidostoma hirtum (Trichoptera) being notable exceptions. Reductions in macroinvertebrate abundance were positively related to the number of days with supercooled water. A partial least squares regression analysis showed a positive relationship between number of days of supercooling and distance to an upstream lake, and negative relationships with stream width and catchment area. Most taxa recovered to pre-disturbance levels after three years. The proportion of less vagile taxa (crustaceans, molluscs, water mites, oligochaetes, flatworms, leeches and beetles combined) was still significantly reduced after three years. Extraordinarily harsh winters can be described as pulse disturbances, inducing temporary effects on total abundance and taxonomic richness, but also with long-term effect on certain taxa, including those that are less vagile.																			0003-9136					JUL	2003	157	4					505	523		10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0157-0505	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0157-0505													WOS:000184873300005

Nutrient Dynamics at the Sediment-Water Interface: Influence of Wastewater Effluents	ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												Uptake and regeneration fluxes and concentrations of nutrients, i.e., nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), phosphate (PO43-) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), were evaluated upstream and downstream of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in the River Wandle, UK, from July to October 2019. Using chamber techniques, water-specific nutrient concentrations were measured at two exposures (3 and 10 min) to calculate fluxes. The WWTP effluent contributed to elevated concentrations and modified flux rates, resulting in significant differences at the study sites. Compared with summer, the concentrations of NO3- and DOC increased while NH4+ and PO43- decreased in autumn. Nutrient fluxes varied both temporally and spatially in uptake (i.e., storage in sediments) or regeneration (i.e., release into river water). Under the actions of physical and biological processes, the fluxes of NO3- and NH4+ showed opposite flux directions. Dissolved oxygen (DO) and bioabsorption mainly affected PO43- and DOC fluxes, respectively. Specifically, across all sites, NO3- was -0.01 to +0.02 mg/(m(2) s), NH4+ was -29 to +2 mu g/(m(2) s), PO43- was -2.0 to +0.5 mu g/(m(2) s), and DOC was -0.01 to +0.05 mg/(m(2) s). Further, we did find that these variations were related to nutrient concentrations in the overlying water. Our results provide further evidence to show that reductions in river nutrients are paramount for improving river ecological conditions. Additionally, we suggest that more research is needed to evaluate chamber-based experimental approaches to make them more comparable to in-situ flux methods.					; Zhang, Meng/GRO-1515-2022; Chadwick, Michael/ABF-6431-2020	Chadwick, Michael/0000-0003-4891-4357; Zhang, Meng/0000-0002-6218-4074; Francis, Robert/0000-0002-4598-0861													2198-7491	2198-7505				DEC	2021	8	4					1337	1357		10.1007/s40710-021-00540-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40710-021-00540-0		OCT 2021											WOS:000702576700001

Land use differences in their catchments were shown to result in estimated total nutrient surface loadings from 0.3 to 32 g m-2 a-1 phosphorus and from 4 to 240 g m-2 a-1 nitrogen. The major ions in the lochs were calcium and carbonate, but with elevated sulphate levels in all three lochs and an increase in sodium, chloride and sulphate in Forfar loch, which was affected by sewage effluent. Conductivity and total alkalinity showed marked increases with greater intensity of land use, from 64 to 439 .mu.S cm-1 and 0.5 - 3 meq 1-1. Maximum winter loch concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus ranged from 60 to just under 5 000 mg m-3 and of inorganic nitrogen from 500 to 10500 mg m-3. Maximum chlorophyll ''a'' ranged from 20 to 250 mg m-3 and comparisons indicated that above winter levels of 5000 mg m-3 N and 500 mg m-3 P, the nutrient chlorophyll relationships did not hold. Predictions of nutrient input, from land use categories and soil losses of N and P derived from other north temperate areas, were shown to be comparable with inputs calculated from loch measurements. Models predicting loch concentrations of phosphorus from inputs were comparable with measured concentrations, but predictions of chlorophyll and transparency became less accurate with higher nutrient levels. The lochs were mesotrophic (the Lowes), eutrophic (Balgavies) and hypertrophic (Forfar) under the several classification systems used. The implications of their nutrient status for lake management are discussed and the value of studying this unique lake series in a similar physical environment but with considerable chemical differences is considered.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY 30	1987	148	3					211	229		10.1007/BF00017525	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00017525													WOS:A1987H818100002

Brominated flame retardants and organochlorine contaminants in winter flounder, harp and hooded seals, and North Atlantic right whales from the Northwest Atlantic Ocean	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Various brominated flame retardants (BFRs), including polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and current-use, non-PBDE BFRs, as well as organochlorine (OC) pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), were measured in winter flounder, harp and hooded seals, and North Atlantic right whales from the Eastern United States and Canada. The concentrations of PBDEs in winter flounder and right whales were similar in magnitude to the levels of PCBs, which was unlike the pattern observed in seals. In these marine mammals, the levels of PBDEs were orders of magnitude lower than the levels of OCs and PCBs detected. Evidence existed for the accumulation of methoxylated (MeO)-PBDEs of natural origin in seals and right whales. Current-use, non-PBDE BFRs (including hexabromocyclododecane, pentabromoethylbenzene, hexabromobenzene, and pentabromotoluene) were detected in winter flounder and marine mammals. Future research should focus on monitoring PBDEs, current-use, non-PBDE BFRs, and MeO-BDEs of natural origin in marine organisms from Massachusetts and Cape Cod Bays. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Meteorological characteristics associated with PM2.5 air pollution in Cleveland, Ohio, during the 2009-2010 Cleveland Multiple Air Pollutants Study	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Cleveland, Akron, and Lorain, Ohio, exceed the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particles with a diameter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5). The 2009-2010 Cleveland Multiple Air Pollutants Study (CMAPS) and analyses were conducted to characterize the sources and processes that contribute to high PM2.5 concentrations in the Cleveland area. The results are being used in high-resolution mesoscale chemical and meteorological modeling to protect public health. This paper summarizes the meteorological measurements collected during CMAPS and describes how three-dimensional meteorological processes influence surface PM2.5 concentrations. Mixing heights were higher, boundary layer winds were stronger, flow was southerly, and ventilation was greater on most episode days compared to non-episode days. While greater ventilation typically results in lower PM2.5 concentrations, in this case the greater ventilation coincided with the transport of regional pollution by southerly winds. Stagnation, or limited transport of air parcels, occurred on the remaining episode days and was associated with limited vertical mixing and light winds. These stagnation/limited dispersion events were associated with a weak lake breeze during the summer and slow-moving, large-scale high-pressure systems with weak surface pressure gradients, resulting in light winds during the winter.

These reaction products can theoretically be stored sustainably in the lake, provided reducing conditions are maintained at the lake bottom. In a field mesocosm experiment, we tested, if reducing conditions can be maintained in an acidic mine pit lake by the addition of a complex organic substrate. An enclosure of 30 m diameter was covered by a floating foil, and whey was repeatedly added to the water column to stimulate microbial respiration. A suspension of whey was successfully mixed into the enclosure by means of a boat motor. Whey was completely dissolved and subsequently consumed by microbial respiration in the water column. This resulted in oxygen consumption leading to anoxic conditions. About 10 mmol m(-2) d(-1) oxygen permanently entered the enclosure from the atmosphere, while a minor amount of oxygen was produced by primary production. By careful monitoring and repeated additions, it was possible to keep the bottom of the enclosure permanently anoxic, even during mixing periods in autumn and spring. Fe3+, however, was not reduced significantly. A laboratory experiment revealed that microbial iron reduction was inhibited by both low concentrations of organic substrates and low temperature. Since Fe-III is a potential oxidizing agent, it is questionable, if the stability of metal-sulfides in acidic mine pit lakes can be increased by the addition of complex organic substrates.

In a study of five ponds sensitive to acid precipitation, we document seasonal acidification profiles and assess the impact of short-term acid pulses on the reproductive success of resident sunfish (Lepomis spp.). 2. Three years of water sampling at 2-3 week intervals showed substantial seasonal variation in pH and alkalinity consistent with a carbonate buffering system. Though all ponds shared a common seasonal pattern in pH, ponds with relatively low pH and alkalinity showed the greatest variation in these parameters. Spring minima may dispose some of the ponds towards episodes of extreme acidity during heavy spring rains. 3. Otolith analysis of young-of-the-year sunfish revealed recruitment failures for eggs laid early in spring in ponds with relatively low alkalinity and pH, and, in the most extreme case, missing day classes at subsequent irregular intervals even though average pH and alkalinity were well above those demonstrated to affect centrarchid fishes. 4. Age-class distributions of sunfishes revealed gaps in adult age distributions which could be traced through 3 years of the study, but there was no clear-cut relationship between pond acidification and the age structure of adult fish. 5. Seasonal profiles of acidity may enable researchers to predict the time during which a pond or lake may be highly sensitive to acid inputs. Comparative otolith analysis of young-of-the-year fishes and short-term continuous monitoring of water chemistry may provide an early warning of biological effects of acidification in sensitive bodies of water.

Optical response associated with changing summer biogeochemical conditions in a turbid lake	LIMNOLOGICA												Water quality degradation in inland water bodies during summer periods due to phytoplankton growth is a global problem. Lake Burley Griffin (LBG) in Canberra, Australia is an artificial, turbid, urban lake which is prone to water quality degradation in summer due to phytoplankton blooms. In Australia only limited (spatial, spectral and temporal) datasets are available that detail the full bio-optical condition of the water body during summer transformation processes. In this study, we conducted field campaigns in LBG to measure biogeochemical as well as inherent optical properties (IOP) during summer 2010 to understand the variability in the optical response. Optically active biogeochemical components such as total suspended solids (TSS), Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) varied over a wide range in response to changing environmental conditions during summer. The underwater optical environment was dominated by light scattering properties and the light absorption budget varied in response to changing CDOM and phytoplankton distributions. Specific inherent optical properties and spectral slopes of ICP observed here were different to other regional datasets, thus indicated the limitation in the extrapolation of optical models from other regions. Optical response as described by the scattering to absorption ratio and backscattering albedo showed that absorption due to CDOM and non-algal particulate matter (NAP) masked phytoplankton absorption features limiting the application of standard optical algorithms. A through description of bio-optical properties, relationships and their variability in response to changing summer biogeochemical conditions in a turbid optically complex lake is presented here.

Evidence from Lake El'gygytgyn, in northeast (NE) Arctic Russia, shows that 3.6 to 3.4 million years ago, summer temperatures were similar to 8 degrees C warmer than today, when the partial pressure of CO2 was similar to 400 parts per million. Multiproxy evidence suggests extreme warmth and polar amplification during the middle Pliocene, sudden stepped cooling events during the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition, and warmer than present Arctic summers until similar to 2.2 million years ago, after the onset of Northern Hemispheric glaciation. Our data are consistent with sea-level records and other proxies indicating that Arctic cooling was insufficient to support large-scale ice sheets until the early Pleistocene.

We analyzed bacteria, archaea, and microbial eukaryotes from 11 saline lakes in winter and spring by rRNA gene fingerprinting and sequencing covering large salinity (2.7-22.1%) and temperature ranges (1.5-35.3 degrees C). The highest ecological diversity (Shannon-Weaver index) was found in protists and the lowest in Archaea. Eukaryotes showed higher ecological diversity at intermediate salinities, whereas Bacteria and Archaea did not. The genetic diversity was broad and with remarkable novelty. The highest novelty was found in Archaea at the lowest saline concentrations, whereas for bacteria and protists, no differences were observed along the gradient. Euryarchaeota of the enigmatic group DHVEG-6 and phylotypes distantly related to well-known haloarchaea were present in several sites. Recurrent presence of bacterial phylotypes distantly related to Psychroflexus and Cryomorphaceae initially isolated from polar marine habitats was observed. Saline lakes contained chlorophyta, among other new groups, substantially different from green algae previously reported in marine or freshwater. The great scientific and ecological value found for macroorganisms can be extended to the idiosyncratic microorganisms inhabiting such unique habitat in Europe.

Concurrent data were available for most water-use categories from 1990 through 2008. Average monthly water withdrawals are discussed for a variety of water-use categories, and average water use per month is depicted graphically. Water quality analysis is presented and historic water quality data of Northwest Indiana, (Lake, Porter and LaPort Counties) were downloaded from USEPA website and they were examined for the trends in different water quality constituents. Individual station based analysis and regional analysis were conducted using MK Test. Water quality data indicated an improvement trend. Water withdrawals data were analyzed using regression and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models. The ANN model performed a better forecasting while compared to a linear regression model. For most water-use categories, the summer months were those of highest withdrawal and highest consumptive use. For public supply, average monthly withdrawals ranged from 2,193 million gallons per day (Mgal/d) (February) to 3,092 Mgal/d (July). North West Indiana energy production had large increases in average monthly withdrawals in the summer months (17,551 Mgal/d in February to 26,236 Mgal/d in July, possibly because of increased electricity production in the summer, a need for additional cooling-water withdrawals when intake-water temperature is high, or use of different types of cooling methods during different times of the year. Average industrial withdrawals ranged from 31,553 Mgal/d (February) to 36,934 Mgal/d (August). The North West Indiana irrigation data showed that most withdrawals were in May through October for golf courses, nurseries, and crop irrigation. Miscellaneous water withdrawals ranged from 12.2 Mgal/d (January) to 41.6.3 Mgal/d (October), commercial facilities that have high water demand in Indiana are medical facilities, schools, amusement facilities, wildlife facilities, large stores, colleges, correctional institutions, and national security facilities. Consumptive use and consumptive-use coefficients were computed by two principal methods in this study: the return flow and withdrawal method and the winter-base-rate method (WBR). The WBR method was not suitable for the industrial and miscellaneous water-use categories. The RW method was not used for public-supply facilities. The public-supply annual average consumptive-use coefficient derived by use of the WBR methods is 8 percent from 1990 to 2008 for North West Indiana; the summer average consumptive-use coefficient was considerably higher with the amount of 20 percent. The energy production annual consumptive-use coefficient was 13 percent by the WBR method, which increased to 28 percent for summer. In terms of maximum accuracy and minimal uncertainty, use of available withdrawal, return-flow, and consumptive-use data reported by facilities and data estimated from similar facilities are preferable over estimates based on data for a particular water-use category or groups of water-use categories. If monthly withdrawal, return flow, and consumptive use data are few and limited, monthly patterns described in this report may be used as a basis of estimation, but the level of uncertainty may be a greater than for the other estimation methods.																					978-0-7918-4951-4				2015									V06AT07A054															WOS:000380413000054

We measured several abiotic variables: depth, water temperature, transparency, suspended organic and inorganic matter, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, and concentrations of dissolved ions. We also investigated the composition of the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities. The pond is shallow (2 to 3 m), with warm water (21 to 31 degrees C), and becomes thermally destratified in winter. Although the pond is stratified during summer, turnover probably occurs at night at this season because of the shallow depth. The pH varied from slightly acid to neutral. Dissolved oxygen concentrations remained near saturation during the entire year. The phytoplankton was represented by 45 taxa in 8 classes, mainly Chlorophyceae (18 taxa) and Zygnemaphyceae (12 taxa). Chlorococcales sp. 1, Chlorella sp. 1, Oscillatoria sp. 1, Cosmarium sphagnicolum, and Staurastrum leptocladium were constantly present. However, most algal taxa were classified as accidental. For zooplankton, 24 taxa were recorded, consisting in large part of rotifers (11 taxa). The most representative families of zooplankton groups were the Arcellidae (testate amoebae), Brachionidae and Trichocercidae (rotifers), Chydoridae (cladocerans), and Cyclopidae (copepods). Arcella vulgaris, Ptygura sp., Moina minuta, and Mesocyclops sp. were constantly present. Young stages of copepods also occurred in each month of sampling. Similar to the phytoplankton, most zooplankton taxa were considered as accidental.

Marine-influenced microbial communities inhabit terrestrial hot springs on a remote island volcano	EXTREMOPHILES												Raoul Island is a subaerial island volcano approximately 1000 km northeast of New Zealand. Its caldera contains a circumneutral closed-basin volcanic lake and several associated pools, as well as intertidal coastal hot springs, all fed by a hydrothermal system sourced from both meteoric water and seawater. Here, we report on the geochemistry, prokaryotic community diversity, and cultivatable abundance of thermophilic microorganisms of four terrestrial features and one coastal feature on Raoul. Hydrothermal fluid contributions to the volcanic lake and pools make them brackish, and consequently support unusual microbial communities dominated by Planctomycetes, Chloroflexi, Alphaproteobacteria, and Thaumarchaeota, as well as up to 3% of the rare sister phylum to Cyanobacteria, Candidatus Melainabacteria. The dominant taxa are mesophilic to moderately thermophilic, phototrophic, and heterotrophic marine groups related to marine Planctomycetaceae. The coastal hot spring/shallow hydrothermal vent community is similar to other shallow systems in the Western Pacific Ocean, potentially due to proximity and similarities of geochemistry. Although rare in community sequence data, thermophilic methanogens, sulfur-reducers, and iron-reducers are present in culture-based assays.					; Stucker, Valerie/G-8124-2011	Stewart, Lucy/0000-0001-7352-3329; 													1431-0651	1433-4909				JUL	2018	22	4					687	698		10.1007/s00792-018-1029-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00792-018-1029-4								29713821					WOS:000434355100012

The Rapid Upstream Migration of Pre-Spawn Lake Sturgeon following Trap-and-Transport over a Hydroelectric Generating Station	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Spawning migrations of Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens are often blocked by dams, and fishway designs suitable for volitional upstream passage, particularly over high-head structures, remain elusive. Trap-and-transport has potential as a management tool but has yet to be evaluated in Lake Sturgeon. In spring 2009, six male and six female Lake Sturgeon in prespawn condition were captured using gill nets downstream of the Seven Sisters Generating Station, located on the Winnipeg River, Manitoba. Each fish received an acoustic transmitter and was released approximate to 500m upstream of the station. Four stationary receivers were deployed in the 41-km stretch of river between the Seven Sisters and Slave Falls generating stations to monitor upstream movements, while an additional four were deployed downstream of Seven Sisters to monitor potential fallback. Following trap-and-transport, all 11 detected fish were observed moving rapidly upstream through backwatered habitats, into the stretch of river where Lake Sturgeon spawning sites occur, before or coincident with the onset of the spawning period. No fallback was observed during initial ascents. While further research is required, trap-and-transport of Lake Sturgeon may be a useful tool for fisheries managers wishing to facilitate historical spawning migrations interrupted by dams.

Thresholds in the Response of Free-Floating Plant Abundance to Variation in Hydraulic Connectivity, Nutrients, and Macrophyte Abundance in a Large Floodplain River	WETLANDS												Duckweed and other free-floating plants (FFP) can form dense surface mats that affect ecosystem condition and processes, and can impair public use of aquatic resources. FFP obtain their nutrients from the water column, and the formation of dense FFP mats can be a consequence and indicator of river eutrophication. We conducted two complementary surveys of diverse aquatic areas of the Upper Mississippi River as an in situ approach for estimating thresholds in the response of FFP abundance to nutrient concentration and physical conditions in a large, floodplain river. Local regression analysis was used to estimate thresholds in the relations between FFP abundance and phosphorus (P) concentration (0.167 mg l(-1)), nitrogen (N) concentration (0.808 mg l(-1)), water velocity (0.095 m s(-1)), and aquatic macrophyte abundance (65 % cover). FFP tissue concentrations suggested P limitation was more likely in spring, N limitation was more likely in late summer, and N limitation was most likely in backwaters with minimal hydraulic connection to the channel. The thresholds estimated here, along with observed patterns in nutrient limitation, provide river scientists and managers with criteria to consider when attempting to modify FFP abundance in off-channel areas of large river systems.

J	Stachowski, P; Oliskiewicz-Krzywicka, A; Kupiec, JM				Stachowski, Piotr; Oliskiewicz-Krzywicka, Anna; Kupiec, Jerzy Miroslaw			The Natural Characteristics of the State of the Water in Lakes in the Area of Open Mine Quarry "Konin"	ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA												The lakes located within the Powidz Landscape Park are observed for many years for the decrease in the water table, which many researchers associate with mining activities, and the water drainage associated with the opencast mines. This paper presents the background to meteorological conditions, in the multi-year period from 1990/1 to 2011/12, of natural changes in water levels in the 3 lakes (Powidzkie, Budzislawskie and Wilczynskie), included in the Powidz Landscape Park (PPK), located in the north - east Wielkopolska Gniezno Lake District, near the mined pit "Jozwin III" Coal Mine "Konin". The analysis confirms the dependence of water levels on the amount and distribution of precipitation, especially in the winter half of the year. Fluctuations in the water levels of the lakes of the Powidz Landscape Park were shaped under the influence of the amount and distribution of precipitation and average air temperature in the successive hydrological years, and especially in the winter half of the year. In the hydrological years of 2004/2005 to 2010/2011, where the amount of precipitation was lower than the average of the observed multi-year, there was an observation of the decrease in the water level in lakes, in relation to the long-term average. It was found that in the period considered as the wet period, there was an increase in water levels, with at least a one year delay. The natural water level in the lakes fell, by about 2.6 m in the Wilczynski lake and by about 1,80 m in the bordering lake Budzislawskim, in relation to the multi-year period 1965 years. In total, about 32 million m3 of water disappeared from the lakes. A particularly fast falling water level was observed in the years from 1990 to 1992 and from 2003 to 2006. In the multi-year trend of declining water levels in lakes of PPK, had a correlation with frequently occurring drought in this part of Wielkopolska and the increase in average air temperature, which resulted in increased evaporation, which is often 130% of the precipitation. Thus the effects of the decrease in water level in the lakes cannot be only associated with dehydration because of the mining. This paper also presents the measures taken (damming water in the lakes and the transfer of water from nearby drained mining pits) for stopping the decrease of the water level and preserving the values of biodiversity and advantages in PPK lakes. This would also increase the level of subsurface water retention and groundwater in the nearby lakes. This would be a perfect solution, requiring little labour and costs, because most studied lakes have damming structures in their outflows. The article is an important contribution to the problem of the unambiguous determination of the causes of precipita in the lakes of Gniezno Lake District, adjacent to the mining outcrops KWB "Konin".

Electron budgets for the hypolimnion of a recovering urban lake, 1989-2004: Response to changes in organic carbon deposition and availability of electron acceptors	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Hypolimnetic electron budgets were developed for sulfate-rich, eutrophic Onondaga Lake, New York, for the summer stratification periods of 16 years (1989-2004) to describe seasonal, long-term, and interannual changes in hypolimnetic metabolism. A mass balance approach was applied to the hypolimnion to estimate the consumption of electron acceptors (e.g., O-2, NO3-) and production of reduced by-products (e.g., H2S, CH4) associated with the decomposition of organic matter. The stoichiometry of the associated redox reactions supported calculation of electron transfer in the hypolimnion and partitioning of the contributions of various metabolic pathways. In 12 of the 16 study years SO42-reduction was the most important decomposition pathway, accounting for an average of 44% of the electron transfer in the hypolimnion. Aerobic decomposition (28%), methanogenesis (19%), and denitrification (9%) were also quantitatively important mineralization processes. The relative importance of the various decomposition pathways to overall hypolimnetic metabolism varied widely in response to an abrupt decrease in organic carbon deposition in 1987, incomplete spring turnover in 1993, and improved nitrification treatment at a contributing wastewater treatment facility in 2004. Changes in the importance of the different decomposition pathways were generally consistent with the thermodynamic constraints that regulate the spatial and temporal patterns of redox processes in aquatic sediments. On average, the discrepancy between observed dissolved inorganic carbon accumulation and that calculated from the four redox pathways was 14%; potential causes for this discrepancy include storage of reduced forms of particulate organic carbon and metabolic by-products in the sediment.

Landscape controls on mercury in streamwater at Acadia National Park, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Fall and spring streamwater samples were analyzed for total mercury (Hg) and major ions from 47 locations on Mount Desert Island in Maine. Samples were collected in zones that were burned in a major wildfire in 1947 and in zones that were not burned. We hypothesized that Hg concentrations in streamwater would be higher from unburned sites than burned watersheds, because fire would volatilize stored Hg. The Hg concentrations, based on burn history, were not statistically distinct. However, significant statistical associations were noted between Hg and the amount of wetlands in the drainage systems and with streamwater dissolved organic carbon (DOC). An unexpected result was that wetlands mobilized more Hg by generating more DOC in total, but upland DOC was more efficient at transporting Hg because it transports more Hg per unit DOC. Mercury concentrations were higher in samples collected at lower elevations. Mercury was positively correlated with relative discharge, although this effect was not distinguished from the DOC association. In this research, sample site elevation and the presence of upstream wetlands and their associated DOC affected Hg concentrations more strongly than burn history.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				MAR	2007	126	1-3					97	104		10.1007/s10661-006-9334-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-006-9334-2								17273895					WOS:000244335800008

Rapid utilisation of storm water-derived dissolved organic carbon and its fractions in an urban lake	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Hypoxia occurred in the Torrens Lake, South Australia, after a 16-mm rainfall which discharged high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the Lake. This work explores the hypothesis that hypoxia was correlated with the bioavailability of DOC. Carbonaceous biological oxygen demand and a decrease in DOC from samples collected immediately after stormwater was discharged into the Lake confirmed the presence of an active aerobic microbial community. In addition, the inlet and outlet of the Lake were monitored over a 10-day period. Dissolved oxygen fell from 10 to <3 mg L-1 within 44 h as the DOC increased and then decreased. A similar pattern occurred at the outlet after a lag of 20 h. At the inlet, because minimal mixing with the Lake water occurred, the rapid decrease of DOC and its fractions was interpreted as a function of aerobic microbial activity. Aquatic humic substances (AHS) were metabolised fastest, followed by hydrophilic acids (HiA) and hydrophilic neutrals (HiN). The warm nature of Mediterranean water bodies during summer may make them more susceptible to hypoxia as the frequency of extreme droughts allow accumulation of leaf litter and other debris that is subsequently mobilised by episodic floods.

Seasonal changes and geographical differences within Archaea, considering abiotic and biotic factors (e.g. temperature, pH, total organic carbon (TOC), NH4 (+), bacteria, fungi), were analysed in this context. Water samples were collected from 8 lakes, 10 creeks and the river Inn in 2014. Qualitative-quantitative data were derived via a comprehensive set of (quantitative) PCR assays and PCR-DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) based methodology, which was evaluated concerning specificity and reliability either previously or in this study. QPCR-derived archaeal abundances reached values of 10(3) copies mL(-1) on average, with a peak in winter-spring ('Cold Peak'), and covered 0-15 % (average: 1 %) of the microbial populations. This peak correlated with significantly raised TOC and low NH4 (+) levels during the cold seasons. Stagnant waters showed significantly higher archaeal abundances and diversities than flowing ones. Among methanogens, Methanosarcinales were the most common order. PCR-DGGE data showed that the archaeal communities were site-specific and could function as an ecological marker, in contrast to the more heterogeneous and unsteady bacterial and fungal community. This is attributable to the highly heterogeneous community of methanogenic Archaea (MA, Euryarchaeota), while only two species, Nitrosopumilus maritimus and Ca. Nitrososphaera gargensis, were found to be the ubiquitous representatives of ammonia-oxidizing Archaea (AOA, Thaumarchaeota) in Alpine freshwaters. This work emphasises the diversity, distribution and seasonality of non-extremophilic Archaea in Alpine freshwaters, with a first insight into their ecophysiological potential.

J	Prowse, TD; Lalonde, V				Prowse, TD; Lalonde, V			Open-water and ice-jam flooding of a northern Delta	NORDIC HYDROLOGY					10th Northern Research Basins Symposium	AUG 28-SEP 03, 1994	SVALBARD, NORWAY	No Res Basins Comm				Flooding is critical to the ecosystem health of many river-delta environments, particularly to perched-ponds and lakes that are vertically separated from the open-water flow system. This is the case for the Peace-Athabasca Delta in northern Canada, one of the world's largest, freshwater deltas. Unfortunately, this delta has not experienced a major flood since 1974. As a result, significant drying has occurred in the higher-elevation portions of the Delta landscape. This has led to significant changes in, for example, the vegetation regime and the related small-mammal habitat. For almost two decades, popular belief was that drying of the Delta was due to a reduction in the size of open-water floods resulting from upstream flow regulation and/or changes in climate. Following a historically high flood in 1990, however, it was realized that open-water floods were relatively ineffective in flooding the perched bases. A historical analysis of hydrometric records revealed that the major peak-water levels have been produced at the time of break-up. The spring flow driving such events are more related to downstream tributary runoff than flow produced within the headwaters, above the point of regulation. Other ice factors, however, such as thickness, strength, and winter levels, may also have been important in controlling break-up severity.																			0029-1277						1996	27	1-2					85	100																WOS:A1996UD62800006

Viability was tested by feeding the oncospheres to laboratory-reared amphipods (Hyalella azteca). The percentage of surviving amphipods that became infected following exposure to oncospheres stored at 7-degrees-C declined steadily from 96 % following 4 weeks storage to 43 % after 24 weeks. Only 3 % (2 of 60) were infected following exposure to oncospheres stored for 28 weeks. Oncospheres held overwinter under natural conditions failed to produce infections. These were slightly older (29 weeks) than the oldest oncospheres maintained at 7-degrees-C in the laboratory, at the time of feeding to the amphipods. It appears that 28 weeks approaches the maximum survival time for the oncospheres of this species. Oncospheres subjected to short-term freezing also failed to produce infections when fed to amphipods. Oncospheres survived in sufficient numbers for up to 24 weeks to be of potential significance in the formation of infective pools in amphipods in the spring. However, there is a northern limit beyond which the inactive period of the amphipod host is too long for the oncospheres to bridge. Under these circumstances, they are of no consequence in the formation of the infective pool. Only 5 % (3 of 60) of the amphipods exposed to oncospheres stored at 20-degrees-C for 4 weeks became infected. Foci established in warmer conditions, as expected, are infective for much shorter periods.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				MAY	1992	70	5					935	940		10.1139/z92-133	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z92-133													WOS:A1992JD66800014
J	Straus, DM; Shukla, J				Straus, DM; Shukla, J			Distinguishing between the SST-forced variability and internal variability in mid latitudes: Analysis of observations and GCM simulations	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												It is shown that the dominant structure of the seasonal-mean mid-latitude circulation (500 hPa height) pattern over the Pacific-North America (PacNA) region forced by tropical sea surface temerature (SST)-related diabatic heating, is distinctly different from the seasonal-mean internal variability pattern that occurs in the absence of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) related SST anomalies. The separation of these two patterns is accomplished by utilizing ensemble General Circulation Model (GCM) integrations in conjunction with re-analyses. Ensemble simulations made with the GCM of the Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Studies (COLA) are compared to the re-analyses of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) for the 16 winters 1981/82-96/97. The GCM ensemble for each winter consists of 9 integrations initialized from analyses, and utilizing the observed time-varying SST. In addition, a 39-year simulation with the same GCM using climatological SSTs (with the observed annual cycle) is used. The hemispheric North Atlantic/Arctic pattern is the leading seasonal-mean empirical orthogonal function (EOF) for: (i) all GCM seasonal means in the ensemble simulations; (ii) the NCEP re-analyses; and (iii) the climatological SST integration. This mode is removed from these datasets. The total seasonal-mean variance of all GCM ensemble integrations is generally quite realistic in the PacNA region. The variance of GCM seasonal-mean deviations about the ensemble mean agrees with that in the climatological SST GCM run, but is about 20% weaker than the observed variance for 29 non-ENSO winters from the NCEP re-analyses. The ratio of the SST-forced variance (obtained from the variance of ensemble means but corrected for the finite sample size) to the internal variance (from the deviations about the ensemble mean) exceeds 2.5 in the eastern Pacific and 4.5 over Mexico. It is highly significant (99% confidence level) over most of the PacNA region. A number of techniques are used to calculate the patterns forced by SST heating and the internal variability patterns. The SST-forced mid-latitude circulation pattern is calculated in seven ways, namely: (1) as the leading EOF of the ensemble-mean GCM height field for the 16 winters; (2) as the leading mode of a singular-value decomposition (SVD) analysis of height with tropical diabatic heating from the GCM; (3) as the leading EOF las above) for NCEP re-analyses for the same 16 winters; (4) as the leading SVD mode las above) for the NCEP re-analyses for the same 16 winters; (5) as the leading EOF of height from re-analyses for the 10 winters having the five strongest warm and five strongest cold tropical SST anomalies in the last 39 years; (6) as the leading SVD mode las above) from re-analyses for these same 10 extreme-SST winters; (7) as a regression of GCM-simulated height on a tropical SST time series obtained from the first EOF mode of re-analysis tropical diabatic heating. It is found that the results of all of these techniques agree extremely well with each other, and that the leading modes in the EOF (SVD) analyses explain large amounts of variance (squared covariance), about 50% (90%). The spread of projections of individual seasonal means on the leading SVD mode of the seasonal-ensemble means, is less than the variation of the projection of the ensemble means on the SVD mode (90% significance level). We draw two conclusions: first, that the GCM ensemble means simulate the observed anomalies with high accuracy; and second, that the observed and simulated anomalies are indeed forced by tropical diabatic heating. The internal variability pattern was calculated in three different ways: (1) as the leading EOF of height of the deviations of each seasonal mean about the corresponding ensemble mean for that winter; (2) as the leading height EOF from the 39-year GCM integration forced by climatological (but annually varying) SST; and (3) as the leading height EOF from re-analyses for 29 winters not associated with very warm and cold tropical SSTs. The patterns derived from these analyses have a common structure. It is found that it is this internal variability pattern, and not the SST-forced pattern described above, that closely resembles the 'PNA' pattern of Wallace and Gutzler. The SST-forced pattern in the GCM (characterized by the heterogeneous correlation pattern of the leading SVD mode for the ensemble means) is significantly different (95% confidence level) from the internal variability pattern (characterized by the homogeneous correlation pattern of the leading EOF of the GCM deviations about the ensemble mean) over a region in western North America and the adjoining eastern Pacific, a region north-east of the Great Lakes, and a small region in the Gulf of Alaska.																			0035-9009					JUL	2000	126	567	B				2323	2350		10.1256/smsqj.56715	http://dx.doi.org/10.1256/smsqj.56715													WOS:000089094500016

Potential hydrochemical origins of different water sources were identified based on ionic indices and standard Piper plots. The findings indicate that pH, electrical conductivity, and concentrations of some major ions (Na+, HCO3-, C-l-, SO42-) were higher in factory waste, groundwater, hot springs, and Lake Basaka than those in irrigation and drainage waters. Groundwater in the study area had a different chemical composition than surface water, which was likely its recharging source. Spring and lake waters acquired characteristics similar to marine water based on their hydrochemical facies and evolution. This study indicates that the hydrochemistry of groundwater, spring water, and lake water have recently been influenced by anthropogenic pollution.					; DINKA, Megersa/LVR-4385-2024	DINKA, MEGERSA OLUMANA/0000-0003-3032-7672; 													2044-2041	2044-205X					2017	7	3					297	304		10.1080/20442041.2017.1329909	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2017.1329909													WOS:000412646100007

Fuji, central Japan was geochemically investigated. Trace vanadium was determined by neutron activation analysis or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. We found distinct differences in vanadium concentration in the water samples between the foot of Mt. Fuji and the Kofu basin. The difference was essentially explained by geological and geochemical characteristics in the areas examined. Further, we discussed the utilization trace vanadium concentrations to the hydrographic studies of the natural waters(underground water, river water and lake water) in the various locations at the foot of Mt. Fuji. The concentration values of trace vanadium of the spring water were in a relatively narrow range. This result suggests that vanadium is leached out through the simple interaction between underground water and Mt. Fuji volcanic rocks. The analytical data of the five lakes at the foot of Mt. Fuji show slightly less homogeneous distribution pattern, compared with that of the spring and ground waters. The informations of trace vanadium were useful as a sensitive indicator to trace the migration of natural water and elucidate the origin of the lakes water.																					4-431-70283-0				2000							171	176																WOS:000088358300029

To augment its depleted population, low numbers of fry and fingerlings of Atlantic coast ancestry were released into the ACF between 1965 and 1976. Restoration of Gulf striped bass was initiated in 1980 when putative Gulf fingerlings spawned from Apalachicola River (Gulf) broodfish were stocked back into the ACF. Since the initial stocking, approximately 10 million phase-I (25-50 mm) and 900,000 phase-II (150-250 mm) fingerlings have been released into Lake Seminole and the Apalachicola River, with hundreds of thousands more released into upstream reservoirs. Low levels of successful natural reproduction in the ACF were documented in 9 of the 10 years that natural reproduction was evaluated. Marked stocked fish have typically comprised 75-100% of fall age-0 samples. After stocking was initiated, striped bass harvest estimates increased as much as 10-fold during peak-season creel surveys conducted in the tailrace of Jim Woodruff Lock and Dam. A comparison of Atlantic-origin and Gulf striped bass co-stocked into an adjacent river-reservoir system over a 5-year period indicated no consistent differences in relative survival or growth through age 4. Gulf striped bass occupied coolwater thermal refuges during summer. Enhancement of thermal refuge habitats was successful, but results were short-lived. Small populations of Gulf striped bass, dependent on stocking of hatchery fish, now exist in several Gulf of Mexico tributary systems where adequate habitat is present. Genetic analysis of both mitochondrial and nuclear genomes revealed that a high percentage of fish from the ACF exhibit mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplo-types and nuclear DNA (nDNA) alleles that are absent in Atlantic populations. However, significant introgression of Atlantic nDNA alleles was documented in the extant population. Knowledge of the life history of Gulf striped bass was improved as a result of this multi-state collaboration as well as a large stocking program, new Gulf broodfish repositories, extensive genetic cataloged database, and expanded trophy fisheries. ACF Gulf striped bass restoration goals and objectives were defined, adjusted, and revised throughout the collaborative process to meet the concerns and management needs of all participating agencies.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-36-3				2013	80						25	63																WOS:000323292100004

To this point of view, field work on the wintering strategy of Greylag Geese in the Ichkeul National Park was realized during two consecutive winters (September 2001-March 2002 and September 2002-March 2003). Results showed that in this area, the Greylag Goose was a regular winter visitor, typically from the beginning of October to the end of March, when food resources were totally exhausted in all marshes. Records of diurnal time budget revealed that feeding (43%) and sleeping (20%) dominated all other activities: walking, flying alertness, and preening. The food resource depletion might be the principal responsible for the total population size decreases, the behavioral changes, and the switch of habitats used by the considered species. This situation is a kind of alarm bell to indicate a perturbation of the habitats in the Ichkeul National Park. Therefore, it is essential to use appropriate management strategies to enhance the value of this area for the bio-indicator species, in particular Greylag Goose which is very sensitive to habitat changes.																			1612-4642	1439-0574				OCT	2008	54	4					635	641		10.1007/s10344-008-0189-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-008-0189-4													WOS:000259414300011

This study deals with the role of reductive processes for the neutralization of acid soil solution within helocrene springs. Two toposequences consisting each of three profiles (forest soil, margin of fen, fen) were established to study the chemistry of the solid phase (soil pH, CEC, pedogenic Fe-and Al-oxides) and the soil solution in two small spring catchments on three dates during 1991 and 1992. Despite high acid inputs and acidified forest soils the pH of the spring outflow is near neutral, and the soil solid phases of the spring fens are not acidified. The results support the following hypothesis: Aluminum with its corresponding anion sulfate is leached with the soil solution into the water-saturated fens. Dissimilatory iron and sulfate reduction take place within the fen and generate alkalinity. Reduced iron either reacts with sulfide to form pyrite or migrates within the fen profile and precipitates in the uppermost, oxic horizons, consuming part of the generated alkalinity. Due to the higher pH values in the fens the incoming aluminum precipitates releasing acidity. The alkalinity generated exceeds the amount of acidity released by oxidation and precipitation of iron and the precipitation of aluminum. A balance of alkalinity consuming and alkalinity generating processes based on solid phases showed that iron and sulfate reduction can account for at least 67% of the neutralization of acidity entering the fen of one of the catchments. Due to shorter water retention times and higher discharge these processes are of minor importance in the other catchment.

Communities at the extreme: Aquatic food webs in desert landscapes	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Studying food webs across contrasting abiotic conditions is an important tool in understanding how environmental variability impacts community structure and ecosystem dynamics. The study of extreme environments provides insight into community-wide level responses to environmental pressures with relevance to the future management of aquatic ecosystems. In the western Lake Eyre Basin of arid Australia, there are two characteristic and contrasting aquatic habitats: springs and rivers. Permanent isolated Great Artesian Basin springs represent hydrologically persistent environments in an arid desert landscape. In contrast, hydrologically variable river waterholes are ephemeral in space and time. We comprehensively sampled aquatic assemblages in contrasting ecosystem types to assess patterns in community composition and to quantify food web attributes with stable isotopes. Springs and rivers were found to have markedly different invertebrate communities, with rivers dominated by more dispersive species and springs associated with species that show high local endemism. Qualitative assessment of basal resources shows autochthonous carbon appears to be a key basal resource in both types of habitat, although the particular sources differed between habitats. Food-web variables such as trophic length, trophic breadth, and community isotopic niche size were relatively similar in the two habitat types. The basis for the similarity in food-web structure despite differences in community composition appears to be broader isotopic niches for predatory invertebrates and fish in springs as compared with rivers. In contrast to published theory, our findings suggest that the food webs of the hydrologically variable river sites may show less dietary generalization and more compact food-web modules than in springs.					; Moran, Nicholas/AAX-8224-2021; Thompson, Ross/D-7996-2013	Wong, Bob/0000-0001-9352-6500; Thompson, Ross/0000-0002-5287-2455; Moran, Nicholas/0000-0002-7331-0400													2045-7758					OCT	2019	9	19					11464	11475		10.1002/ece3.5648	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.5648		SEP 2019						31641486					WOS:000485554600001

We used neckbands and radio transmitters to measure movements and survival of geese. We conducted aerial and ground surveys to estimate the size of goose populations. The 800-ha TLWMA refuge provided hunting season sanctuary for geese bredding in a 1,500-km2 area surrounding the refuge. Fidelity of local geese to feeding and roosting sites was strong throughtout the fall. prehunting-season flight patterns to feeding sites off the refuge continued despite heavy hunting pressure. Marked families from a given brood-rearing site fed and roosted together at rates greater than would have been expected by chance. This subflock behavior, combined with consistent flight patterns, resulted in differential mortality among brood-rearing groups. In contrast, migrants remained at TLWMA briefly, fed independently from local geese when off the refuge, and were harvested at a lower rate (P < 0.05) than local geese.

J	SCHNEIDER, DW				SCHNEIDER, DW			A BIOENERGETICS MODEL OF ZEBRA MUSSEL, DREISSENA-POLYMORPHA, GROWTH IN THE GREAT-LAKES	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												An individual growth model of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, is presented, based on weight- and temperature-specific physiological parameters taken from the literature on zebra mussels and marine mussels. Given food availability and water temperature the model can predict growth and consumption of zebra mussels in diverse environments. The model was tested with data from Lake Constance and matches observed growth fairly closely. Using the functional response of zebra mussels to increasing food concentration, the model simulates individual zebra mussel growth in novel habitats. For the Great Lakes, the following predictions were made: zebra mussels have bimodal growth patterns, with rapid growth in the spring and fall during periods of high food availability and moderate temperatures; growth rates are highest in Lake Ontario and lowest in Lake Superior, reflecting the trophic gradient in the Great Lakes; based on published weight/fecundity relationships, zebra mussels reach reproductive size in all of the Great Lakes except the main body of Lake Superior; and local eutrophication (e.g, Duluth/Superior Harbor) increases zebra mussel growth rates. Modelled consumption rates in Lakes Erie and Ontario are also consistent with rates of consumption by the zebra mussel in eutrophic and mesotrophic European lakes.																			0706-652X					JUL	1992	49	7					1406	1416		10.1139/f92-156	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f92-156													WOS:A1992JE74700013

Light and scanning electron microscopical examination made it possible to study in detail the morphology of this so far little-known species. In contrast to the original species description, no cuticular bosses are found on the body surface; in addition to the previously reported eight large cephalic papillae of the external circle, the cephalic end also bears six (2 lateral and 4 submedian) small papillae of the internal circle and a pair of inconspicuous amphids; no oesophageal teeth are present and the anterior oesophageal lobes are slightly elevated; two large, lateral, papilla-like caudal projections are present. To date P. parasiluri has been found only in Japan and the present finding represents the third documented record of this species. Philometra parasiluri probably has a pronounced annual maturation cycle with the period of the production of larvae in the late spring and summer.

Predatory demands of Bythotrephes and Leptodora in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Predatory invertebrates can be a major factor in structuring zooplankton communities. We collected zooplankton and the predatory cladocerans Bythotrephes longimanus and Leptodora kindtii at 4 stations in inner Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron during May-October 2009 and April-November 2010. Production of zooplankton prey was estimated using temperature and biomass based empirical models. Population consumption rates of Bythotrephes and Leptodora were estimated using a combination of conversion efficiency, bioenergetics and experimental based models. Bythotrephes biomass peaked in July of 2009 and 2010, and in 2010, the biomass rebounded in the fall after a late summer decline. Leptodora biomass was generally lower than that of Bythotrephes except in June 2009 and August 2010. Zooplankton biomass, production and composition showed strong seasonal patterns, with biomass more than tripling between May and June each year, largely due to an increase in biomass of Daphnia in June. By contrast, total zooplankton biomass declined by over 70% between June and July owing to declines in Daphnia biomass. Population consumption by predatory cladocerans was a large percentage or even exceeded prey production during July and August in Saginaw Bay regardless of which consumption models were used. This short term (<2 months) but pronounced predation capacity of predatory cladocerans in Saginaw Bay was mainly due to consumption by Bythotrephes rather than Leptodora. Bythotrephes likely play an important role in food web function and should be accounted for when evaluating the flow of energy within the Laurentian Great Lakes systems.

Gary			Angler Experience and Seasonal Effects on the Response of the Lake Sturgeon to Catch-and-Release Angling	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens, once widespread throughout North America, are now considered endangered in much of their natural range. However, recreational catch-and-release (C&R) fisheries targeting the Lake Sturgeon have developed in areas with strong populations. Here, we evaluated physiological and behavioral impairment of Lake Sturgeon after C&R angling. Fish were angled from the Winnipeg River and transferred to a holding pen to recover and facilitate serial sampling after angling. Measured physiological traits included blood osmolality, pH, glucose, and cortisol concentration. Behavioral impairment was measured as a binary score using reflex action mortality predictors in addition to ventilation rate. The effects of season and angler experience on these measured variables were assessed. Catch-and-release angling resulted in an immediate physiological stress response and behavioral impairment in all Lake Sturgeon regardless of treatment. Generally, we observed a recovery in acid-base balance, ion balance, and reflex impairment by 24 h; however, cortisol and glucose were elevated throughout the recovery period, possibly indicating interactive stressors of holding and repeat sampling. Angling in the summer period caused increased ventilation rate and decreased osmolality at all timepoints compared to angling in the spring. In comparison with experienced anglers, novice anglers caused higher reflex impairment in Lake Sturgeon immediately after capture. This is the first study to examine the response of wild Lake Sturgeon to C&R angling. Data show an apparent resilience of Lake Sturgeon to C&R and can be used to assess the validity of C&R as a management strategy in the conservation of Lake Sturgeon.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV	2020	149	6					709	720		10.1002/tafs.10266	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tafs.10266		NOV 2020											WOS:000586711300001

However, in cloudy and rainy areas, it is difficult to retrieve useful satellite images, especially in the rainy season. To address this problem, we used data from the HJ-1/CCD (Chinese environment and disaster monitoring and forecasting satellite/charge coupled device), GF-1/WFV (Chinese high-resolution satellite/wide field of view), and Landsat-8/OLI (Operational Land Imager) satellites to generate a time series of the bloom area from 2009 to 2016 in Dianchi Lake, China. We then correlated the responses of bloom dynamics to meteorological factors. Several findings can be drawn: (1) a higher bloom frequency and a larger bloom area occurred in 2011, 2013, and 2016, compared to the other years; (2) the frequency of blooms peaked in April, August, and November each year and expanded from north to south starting in July; (3) air temperature in spring and sunshine hours in summer greatly correlated to the yearly bloom area; (4) wind speed and sunshine hours strongly affected the short-term expansion of blooms and thereafter influenced the monthly bloom scale; and (5) rainfall had a strong short-term influence on the occurrence of blooms. Cyanobacteria blooms often occurred when wind speeds were less than 2.35 +/- 0.78 m/s in the dry season and 2.01 +/- 0.75 m/s in the rainy season, when there were 48 to 72 h of sunshine in the dry season and 35 to 57 h of sunshine in the rainy season, and when there was more than 10 mm of daily precipitation.

Upstream-downstream comparisons and experimental introduction of carcasses were used to determine how salmon carcass decomposition influenced several stream eosystem components, including total phosphorus, total nitrogen, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), NO3-, NH4+, periphyton biomass, and fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) in transport. Total phosphorus, SRP, and periphyton biomass were higher in a river reach that received a spawning run of an estimated 1200 fish than in an upstream reach that lacked spawning salmon. No upstream-downstream gradient in these components occurred in a river that did not receive a spawning run. Total phosphorus, SRP, and periphyton also were elevated where we experimentally introduced salmon carcasses, in the absence of a natural salmon run. Stable isotope analyses revealed that salmon-derived nitrogen was incorporated into grazing mayflies, and to a lesser extent into filter-feeding caddisflies. Salmon-derived carbon was not incorporated into these macroinvertebrates. These results show that salmon carcasses can be an important source of nutrients in streams even when runs are relatively small.																			0887-3593					JUN	1995	14	2					259	268		10.2307/1467778	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1467778													WOS:A1995RB46600004
J	MCLAREN, IA				MCLAREN, IA			PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF OGAC LAKE A LANDLOCKED FIORD ON BAFFIN ISLAND	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												Ogac Lake is the small (148 ha) landlocked head of a fiord with 3 distinct basins. It receives highest spring tides (maximal range 12 m, as high as 1.2 m above lake level) monthly during the open-water season through a narrow entrance. The predictable inflows displaced about 1/4 of the lake''s volume in 1957. The lake is meromictic, fresh at the surface and 28%o salinity at depth. Some 55 kg/m2 salt lost in surface outflow in summer was more than restored by the tides by the end of 1957. Deep salinities did not change between 1951 and 1962. Vertical attenuation of light is adequately accounted for by chlorophyll alone. The lake is much warmer than the nearby sea. Temperature inversions are caused by cold tidal water and perpetuated by vertical stability. The gross annual heat budget in 1957 was 22,000 cal/cm2, about the same as in the nearby sea, but higher than in a freshwater lake. Heating from below a few m to 30 m can be accounted for by radiation alone. About 20% of radiation reaching the bottom subsequently appeared as heat in the water immediately overlying the bottom, thus implying restricted horizontal transfer. O was absent below 25-32.5 m, which may approximate the compensation level in this and similar lakes. O dif-ferences between basins are partly controlled by morphometry. Distinct oxygen minima in 1957 were associated with temperature minima and caused by concentrations of zooplankton. Vertical distribution of pH parallels that of O. Specific alkalinities seem slightly higher than in normal seawater. Phosphate showed a distinct and stable minimum just above the anoxic layer and was as high as 14.3 [mu]g-at/liter within that layer. Nitrate was relatively low and maximal just above the anoxic layer. Although nutrient levels seemed partly related to morphometry in the 3 basins, no evidence of nutrient enrichment of bottom water was found in late summer. The tides contribute negligible nutrients to the lake. The character of Ogac Lake compared with similar lakes derives from the great tidal amplitude and narrow connection with the sea, as well as from its small size and sheltered setting.																									1967	24	5					981	+		10.1139/f67-088	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f67-088													WOS:A19679546100009

This study examined the geographical and seasonal distribution of microplastics in the surface water of Kumaraswamy Lake, Coimbatore. During seasons, including summer, premonsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon, samples were collected from the lake's inlet, centre, and outlet. All sampling points contained linear low-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and polypropylene microplastics. Water samples contained fibre, thin, fragment, and film microplastics in black, pink, blue, white, transparent, and yellow colours. Lake's microplastic pollution load index was under 10, indicating risk I. Over four seasons, microplastic content was 8.77 & PLUSMN; 0.27 particles per litre. The monsoon season had the highest microplastic concentration, followed by pre-monsoon, post-monsoon, and summer. These findings imply that the spatial and seasonal distribution of microplastics may be harmful to the fauna and flora of the lake.					; Selavaraju, Raja/ABH-4356-2020	Selavaraju, Raja/0000-0001-5994-1356; DAVIS, EPHSY/0000-0002-5019-3125; 													1382-6689	1872-7077				AUG	2023	101								104207	10.1016/j.etap.2023.104207	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.etap.2023.104207		JUL 2023						37385395					WOS:001040328700001
J	Rivier, IK				Rivier, IK			Composition and some ecological features of winter zooplankton in deep stratified lakes	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												For the first time, zooplankton and environmental factors have been studied in winter in the deep stratified lakes Siverskoe, Borodaevskoe, and Vydogoshch. The zooplankton consists of 18-22 species of rotifers, copepods, and cladocerans, including 15-18 specifically winter, cryophilic and eurythermic forms. The populations of zooplankters reproduce actively: males and egg-bearing females (in copepods), females with embryos and eggs in brood pouches (in cladocerans), and females with attached eggs (in rotifers) are present. In lakes Siverskoe and Borodaevskoe (depth 20-24 m), where oxygen deficiency is observed only in the bottom water layer, the zooplankton populates the greater part of the water column and forms a large aggregation in the oxycline and near the bottom. The abundance of bacteria in these zones is high (up to 4-6 x 10(6) cells/ml). In Lake Vydogoshch (depth 16 m), oxygen deficiency extends to the middle layers, and all zooplankton is distributed above the oxycline. The biomass of winter zooplankton in Lake Siverskoe in 1983 averaged 1.26 g/m(3), with a maximum of 4 g/m(3); in 1993, 1.4 and 8.04 g/m(2); the respective values in Lake Borodaevskoe were 0.98 and 3.1 in 1983 and 0.14 and 1.6 in 1993; in Lake Vydogoshch, 0.15 and 0.24 in 1983 and 1.25 g/m(3) in 1993. The development of winter zooplankton is limited by the size of the zone of oxygen deficiency and depends on the amount of food (bacterioplankton). The distribution of zooplankton in the water column and its biomass in individual layers is determined by the rate of methane formation and oxidation.																			1067-4136					MAY-JUN	2005	36	3					179	192		10.1007/s11184-005-0057-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11184-005-0057-3													WOS:000229460600006

Influenced by primary sources and the properties of chlorinated paraffins (CPs), a gradient trend of concentrations and a fractionation of composition from more to less industrialized areas were discovered. Intense seasonal variations with high levels in summer air and winter deposition samples indicated that the air and deposition CP levels were controlled mainly by the vapor and particle phase, respectively. Complex environmental processes like volatilization and fractionation resulted in different CP profiles in different environment matrixes and sampling locations, with C10-11 Cl6-7 and C-14 Cl6-7, C10-12 Cl6-7 and C-14 Cl6-8, and C11-12 Cl6-8 and C-14 Cl7-8 dominating in air, soil, and atmospheric deposition, respectively. Shorter-chain and less chlorinated congeners were enriched in air in the less industrialized areas, while longer-chain and higher chlorinated congeners were concentrated in soil in the more industrialized areas. This is suggesting that the gaseous transport of CPs is the dominant mechanism responsible for the higher concentrations of lighter and likely more mobile CPs in the rural areas.					li, jun/C-4943-2012; Zhang, Ruijie/F-3478-2010; Li, Qilu/AAC-7490-2020; Zhang, Gan/C-3528-2012; Li, Jun/C-4943-2012; Katsoyiannis, Athanasios/E-4901-2012; Cheng, Zhineng/E-2001-2011; Liu, Di/LLM-9279-2024; Wang, Yan/G-8823-2013; li, chao/HMD-6210-2023	Li, Jun/0000-0002-3637-1642; Liu, Di/0000-0003-0533-5574; Katsoyiannis, Athanasios/0000-0002-7984-9423; Cheng, Zhineng/0000-0002-6598-849X; Wang, Yan/0000-0003-0899-7899; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				MAR 19	2013	47	6					2679	2687		10.1021/es304425r	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es304425r								23448390					WOS:000316594000032

The Effect of Artificial Recharge on Hydrochemistry: A Comparison of Two Fluvial Gravel Pit Lakes with Different Post-Excavation Uses in The Netherlands	WATER												Gravel pit lakes form when gravel deposits are excavated below the water table. We studied two fluvial gravel pit lakes called De Lange Vlieter (DLV Lake) and the Boschmolen Plas (BP Lake), in the Meuse River valley (The Netherlands). Water from the Meuse River is pumped only into the DLV Lake that is used for drinking water production. The mean values, the linear trends and seasonal patterns of time series data (2003-2014), of temperature, pH, nitrate, phosphate and sulphate were compared using one-way tests of variance and tests of differences. The effects of river water infiltration on DLV Lake are (1) a change in lake water temperature; (2) an increase in nitrate concentration (3) an increase in phosphate concentration and (4) a decrease in sulphate concentration. The effects of the air blowers in DLV Lake are (1) mixing of lake water; (2) decreasing pH in spring and summer (3) water oxygenation. Linear regression analysis shows an initially increasing nitrate concentration in DLV Lake that can be explained by the input of nitrate rich Meuse river water. Instead decreasing nitrate and phosphate concentrations in BP Lake and Meuse River reflect a diminished use of fertilizers. The gravel pit lake water temperature does not reflect climatic changes but the use of DLV Lake for artificial recharge has an impact on the seasonal and long-term trends in hydrochemistry. This poses a challenge to lake managers to find the right balance between reduction of eutrophication and accumulation of nutrients and sulphate.																				2073-4441				SEP	2016	8	9							409	10.3390/w8090409	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w8090409													WOS:000385482400049

Siberian plants shift their phenology in response to climate change	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Siberia has undergone dramatic climatic changes due to global warming in recent decades. Yet, the ecological responses to these climatic changes are still poorly understood due to a lack of data. Here, we use a unique data set from the Russian 'Chronicles of Nature' network to analyse the long-term (1976-2018) phenological shifts in leaf out, flowering, fruiting and senescence of 67 common Siberian plant species. We find that Siberian boreal forest plants advanced their early season (leaf out and flowering) and mid-season (fruiting) phenology by -2.2, -0.7 and -1.6 days/decade, and delayed the onset of senescence by 1.6 days/decade during this period. These mean values, however, are subject to substantial intraspecific variability, which is partly explained by the plants' growth forms. Trees and shrubs advanced leaf out and flowering (-3.1 and -3.3. days/decade) faster than herbs (-1 day/decade), presumably due to the more direct exposure of leaf and flower buds to ambient air for the woody vegetation. For senescence, we detected a reverse pattern: stronger delays in herbs (2.1 days/decade) than in woody plants (1.0-1.2 days/decade), presumably due to the stronger effects of autumn frosts on the leaves of herbs. Interestingly, the timing of fruiting in all four growth forms advanced at similar paces, from 1.4 days/decade in shrubs to 1.7 days/decade in trees and herbs. Our findings point to a strong, yet heterogeneous, response of Siberian plant phenology to recent global warming. Furthermore, the results highlight that species- and growth form-specific differences among study species could be used to identify plants particularly at risk of decline due to their low adaptive capacity or a loss of synchronization with important interaction partners.

Olive mill wastewater as a source of organic matter, water and nutrients for restoration of degraded soils and for crops managed with sustainable systems	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Every year, worldwide olive oil production produces in a short period of time (late autumn-winter) vast quantities of olive mill wastewater (OMW). This product causes environmental and management problems due to its disposal into rivers and lakes. During the last years, OMW application (used either as crude, raw material, or as treated- with different methods- product, in order to decrease its phytotoxicity) was tested under field conditions as organic amendment; many times, the results with regard to the raise of plant growth, crop yields and enhancement of soil fertility were promising, while in some other cases phytotoxicity problems, groundwater contamination, decreased soil porosity, as well as enhanced electrical conductivity, salinity, increased soil acidity and decreased N mineralization rate occurred. On the other hand, OMW is a low-cost source of nutrients (especially N, P, K, Mg and Fe), water, and organic matter; thus, it can be successfully used for the restoration of degraded croplands, in hilly, eroded, poor in organic C, and/or semi-arid areas. Since one of the first steps in land restoration process is the enhancement of soil organic C, OMW is an excellent alternative solution for the: i) increase of organic matter, ii) improvement of soil physical properties, and iii) enhancement of productivity of degraded croplands. In addition, under certain conditions (use of treated, or diluted with water OMW in order to decrease phenol content, avoidance of exaggerate applications, suitable application rate(s) and season), OMW can be safely used as a soil amendment and low-cost organic fertilizer for crops, managed with sustainable systems. The basic purpose of this review was to present and thoroughly discuss all the beneficial aspects of OMW application with regard to: i) the restoration of degraded croplands, ii) sustainable crop management, based on the most important and recently published papers. In addition, the environmental consequences of exaggerate and untreated OMW applications, together with some solutions (strategies) adopted for eliminating soil and groundwater contamination and phytotoxicity are also presented in this review article.

In a mountain basin at 2500 m elevation in central Idaho, we studied the habitat use and movement patterns of 736 marked and 87 radio-tagged Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris) from 1995 to 1998. The goals of this study were to (i) identify and characterize R. luteiventris breeding, summer foraging, and overwintering habitats, (ii) describe the movement patterns of juvenile, male, and female R. luteiventris among these resources, and (iii) determine migration routes. Juvenile and adult R. luteiventris occupied a variety of widely distributed wetlands from late June to September. On average, 1-32% of juvenile, 6-11% of male, and 16-51% of female frogs moved from breeding ponds to summer habitats. Migratory males remained within 200 m of the breeding sites, whereas females traveled up to 1030 m to reach summer habitats. From late August through September, frogs migrated to deep (>3 m) lakes to overwinter. Frog migrations occurred quickly and often followed shortest-distance travel routes through dry, open forest even when stream corridors were available nearby. This study exemplifies the need to protect both complementary resources and the corridors connecting these anuran habitats.

However, due to the lack of recoveries of ringed individuals along the East Asian migratory flyway, and the size-dependent limitation on the use of geolocators, studies of the migration routes of small leaf-warblers are scarce. The only promising method is flight range estimation by using biometric parameters to identify migration distances and locate possible stopover sites along the flyway. The aim of this study was to estimate the flight ranges of migrant Radde's warblers Phylloscopus schwarzi, Dusky Warblers P. fuscatus and Pallas's Leaf-warblers P. proregulus at a stopover site next to Lake Baikal, Russia. For the analyses, we used the body mass, fat score and wing-length data of 809 individuals, which were trapped with mist-nets during the autumn migration periods between 2012 and 2017. Our results show that body mass, but not wing length, increased significantly among individuals with increasing fat scores in all study species. The estimated flight ranges of Pallas's Leaf-warbler (724km) and Radde's Warbler (510km) were similar to those of birds studied in a different part of Siberia, and the number of calculated stopovers was also similar between the two areas. In contrast, Dusky Warblers trapped at our study site were estimated to fly shorter distances (217km) and therefore must have stopped more frequently on their way to the wintering grounds.																			0570-7358	2341-0825				JAN	2020	67	1					57	67		10.13157/arla.67.1.2020.sc1	http://dx.doi.org/10.13157/arla.67.1.2020.sc1													WOS:000513020400005

We hypothesized that not all microorganisms (i.e., HB, HF) equally increase with nutrient levels, thus, resulting in a weaker degree of coupling between HB and HF in more eutrophic waters. During the spring-summer 2009-2011, we sampled 40 Pampean lakes situated in different watershed of Buenos Aires Province. Abundances of most microbial components were very high, even higher than those reported in the literature. HB as well as picocyanobacteria (Pcy) increases with trophic state, while no clear relationship was found between protist (HF or ciliates) and Chl-a concentrations or nutrient levels. Photosynthetic picoplankton was generally dominated by phycocyanin-rich Pcy. Lakes with high HB and low HF were abundant, which suggest these components were weakly coupled. Based on the abundance of microorganisms, we do not accumulate enough evidence to segregate Pampean lakes into two discrete groups (clear vs turbid).					; Torremorell, Ana/AAS-3083-2021	Torremorell, Ana/0000-0003-3903-6863; Unrein, Fernando/0000-0002-8592-1858; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2015	752	1					103	123		10.1007/s10750-014-2019-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-014-2019-x													WOS:000352652500009

Byproduct volume of bighead carp is significant at up to 60 % of whole fish weight. A better understanding of the nutritional composition is needed to optimize the use of these raw materials. The objective of this research was to characterize seasonal variations of fatty acid profile in different tissues (heads, bones, skin, scales, viscera, muscle and fins) of farmed bighead carp. The fatty acid composition of farmed bighead carp varied significantly with seasons and tissues. The highest lipid content was determined in viscera while the highest EPA and DHA composition were observed in muscle compared to the other tissues. Significantly higher Sigma EPA+DHA (%) was recorded in all tissues in summer (June) when compared with those of the other three seasons (p<0.05). The n-3/n-6 fatty acid ratios in summer ranged from 3.38 to 3.69, nearly three times the ratios of the other three seasons. The results indicated that farmed bighead carp caught in summer could better balance the n-3 PUFA needs of consumers. The byproducts of bighead carp can be utilized for the production of fish oil.

J	Anderson, EJ; Gronewold, AD				Anderson, Eric J.; Gronewold, Andrew D.			Does Ice Cover Cap Evaporation in Large Lakes?	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Lakes are experiencing ice declines and fundamental changes in winter conditions. For Earth's largest lakes that experience seasonal ice cover, the relationship between ice conditions and evaporation is critical to water balance estimates and global freshwater storage. Here, we analyze robust data sets of net basin supplies, satellite-derived products, and model estimates of surface turbulent heat flux for the Laurentian Great Lakes during the period 1973-2022. We show that ice cover does not have a strong relationship with lake evaporation in winter months and that often the magnitude of the ice effect on moisture flux reduction is within the range of natural variability and the uncertainty of water budget estimates. This suggests that differences in lake evaporation between cold and warm winters is driven by seasonal overlake atmospheric conditions, more broadly, and that ice cover reduces but does not determine the resultant evaporation.

Almost all the investigated floes were first-year ice, except for one located north of Alaska, which was probably multi-year ice transported from north of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago during early summer. The snow covers over all the investigated floes were in the melting phase, with temperatures approaching 0 C and densities of 295-398 kg/m(3). The snow covers can be divided into two to five layers of different textures, with most cases having a top layer of fresh snow, a round-grain layer in the middle, and slush and/or thin icing layers at the bottom. The first-year sea ice contained about 7%-17% granular ice at the top. There was no granular ice in the lower layers. The interior melting and desalination of sea ice introduced strong stratifications of temperature, salinity, density, and gas and brine volume fractions. The sea ice temperature exhibited linear cooling with depth, while the salinity and the density increased linearly with normalized depth from 0.2 to 0.9 and from 0 to 0.65, respectively. The top layer, especially the freeboard layer, had the lowest salinity and density, and consequently the largest gas content and the smallest brine content. Both the salinity and density in the ice basal layer were highly scattered due to large differences in ice porosity among the samples. The bulk average sea ice temperature, salinity, density, and gas and brine volume fractions were -0.8 degrees C, 1.8, 837 kg/m(3), 9.3% and 10.4%, respectively.

Oxidation of sulphide to sulphate drives precipitation of stellate and platy barite microcrystals in the proximal flow paths. Downstream, and in vent- and tributary-fed ponds, barite is precipitated among streamer and mat forming colonies of sulphur-tolerant microbes, including Thiothrix, Beggiatoa, Thioploca, Chromatium, Oscillatoria, fungi (dominantly Penicillium), and unicellular sulphate reducing bacteria. These microbes mediate barite saturation by adjusting redox gradients and via passive adsorption of barium ions to cell surfaces and extracellular polymeric substances. Passive biomineralization produces barite laminae in floating microbial mats, nanometric coatings, and micrometric encrustations around microbial cells and filaments, and local permineralization of Thiothrix, Beggiatoa, and Oscillatoria outer cell walls. Intracellular barium enrichment and (or) metabolic sulphur oxidation may be important to "active biomineralization" that produces nanometric barite globules on the tips of fungal hyphae, barite-filled cell cavities in Beggiatoa and Thiothrix, and baritized sulphur globules. Degradation of biomineralized cells generates detrital "microfossils," including barite tunnels, layered cylinders, solid cylindrical grains and chains of barite beads. The diversity of inorganic and biomineralized barite in the Flybye Springs flow path highlights the influence of ambient chemistry, microbial metabolism, and cellular structure on barite solubility and on the taphonomy of microfossils preserved in barite.

Based on the daily precipitation data of the northeastern China (NEC) region, and the atmospheric circulation field and temperature field data of ERA-Interim for every six hours, the NCCV processes during the early summer (June) seasons from 1979 to 2018 were objectively identified. Then, the NCCV processes were classified using a machine learning method (k-means) according to the characteristic parameters of the activity path information. The rationality of the classification results was verified from two aspects, as follows: (1) the atmospheric circulation configuration of the NCCV on various paths; and (2) its influences on the climate conditions in the NEC. The obtained results showed that the activity paths of the NCCV could be divided into four types according to such characteristics as the generation origin, movement direction, and movement velocity of the NCCV. These included the generation-eastward movement type in the east of the Mongolia Plateau (eastward movement type or type A); generation-southeast longdistance movement type in the upstream of the Lena River (southeast long-distance movement type or type B); generation-eastward less-movement type near Lake Baikal (eastward less-movement type or type C); and the generation-southward less-movement type in eastern Siberia (southward less-movement type or type D). There were obvious differences observed in the atmospheric circulation configuration and the climate impact of the NCCV on the four above-mentioned types of paths, which indicated that the classification results were reasonable.					; Chen, Haishan/W-3747-2018; Zhou, Fang/JPX-7825-2023	Zhou, Fang/0000-0002-6059-0108; Chen, Haishan/0000-0002-2403-3187; Yi, LIN/0000-0002-6496-2263; 													0256-1530	1861-9533				MAR	2021	38	3					400	412		10.1007/s00376-020-0118-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00376-020-0118-3		JAN 2021											WOS:000604803300003
J	Yamamoto, Y; Kao, SJ				Yamamoto, Yoshimasa; Kao, Shuh-Ji			Relationship between latitude and growth of bluegill Lepomis macrochirus in Lake Biwa, Japan	ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI												Seasonal changes in body size and stable isotope ratios of bluegill Lepomis macrochirus were monitored at three sites in Lake Biwa in an attempt to investigate the latitudinal variation in the fish growth pattern. delta C-13 values of bluegill tended to decrease as latitude increased, implying the presence of a thermal gradient across the lake. In contrast, delta N-15 values of bluegill increased with increasing latitude. Better digestive performance of the fish at higher latitudes was assumed to explain this result, whereas the discharge from a sewage treatment plant seemed to have a more direct impact on the extremely high delta N-15 values of bluegill at the highest latitude site. Length-weight relationships were used to assess the changes in the body weight of fish with a normalized body size. Bluegill at higher latitudes exhibited greater body weights with a prolonged duration of body weight gain. Bluegill at lower latitudes may have adapted to grow rapidly from late spring to early summer when feeding activity increases in response to increasing water temperature, while the catabolic activity remains at a low level. In contrast, bluegill at higher latitudes can continue to grow until the midsummer months owing to the lower water temperature. The seasonal growth pattern of bluegill was analyzed using a logistic-type equation. The assumption that the selection of growth rate or final body size depends on temperature may reasonably explain the latitudinal variation in the growth pattern of bluegill in Lake Biwa.

Consequently, there probably are significant disconformities within the Pahrump Group that separate unrelated, tectonically distinct episodes of basin subsidence. The Crystal Spring and Beek Spring Formations are considered to be platform-cover rocks preserved as a result of block faulting during deposition of the upper Kingston Peak Formation. The age of the Pahrump sills is in excellent agreement with the age of sills that intrude the Apache Group (central Arizona) and the Unkar Group (Grand Canyon) and supports earlier correlations of those units.

We identified 192 species of phytoplankton belonging to 8 phyla and 84 genera, of which 46.4 % of Chlorophyta, 29.2 % of Bacillariophyta, and 12.5 % of Cyanophyta. There were 14 predominant species. Marked temporal and spatial variations were observed in the phytoplankton community. The total abundance of phytoplankton ranged from 3.66 x 10(5) to 867.93 x 10(5) cells/L and total biomass ranging from 0.40 to 20.89 mg/L. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index varied from 3.50 to 8.35 with an average of 5.58, revealing high biodiversity in the phytoplankton community. There were substantial temporal changes in the dominant species, from Bacillariophyta and Cryptophyta to Cyanophyta and Chlorophyta. Phytoplankton biomass and abundance showed a similar increasing trend from February to July. Pearson correlations and Redundancy analysis revealed that the most significant environmental factors influencing phytoplankton community were water temperature (T), transparency (SD), and nutrient concentration. The positive correlation between the key water bird areas and phytoplankton biomass indicated that the droppings of wintering water birds had an important influence on the phytoplankton community in the upper lake of Shengjin Lake.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2015	22	18					14144	14156		10.1007/s11356-015-4640-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-4640-2								25966883					WOS:000360844200048

For FD. specific growth rates were slightly higher for triploids (2.79%/d) than for diploids (2.60%/d), but final mean weight at 108 d did not significantly differ. For SC and TS, there were no significant differences in final mean weight or specific growth rates after 138 or 122 d,. respectively. Feed conversion ratios and fish mortality in the raceways did not differ significantly between diploids and triploids, except for SC for which mortality rates were slightly higher for triploids (4.0%) than diploids (2.1%). Possible differences in agonistic behavior between diploids and triploids were assessed by video observation of size-matched pairs (diploid-diploid, diploid-triploid. or triploid-triploid). There were no significant differences between diploid and triploid fish of any strain in the number of chases or counterattacks. To determine whether there were ail), differences in susceptibility to stocking and handling stressors, each strain was transported at high density for 4 h. then stocked into (1) tanks with ambient hatchery well water (control), (2) tanks with either high pH and high temperature (FD) or high temperature (TS and SC, or (3) the tail end of the raceway from which it came. There were no significant differences in mortality after 96 h between diploid and triploid fish for any of the three strains for and of the treatments. Poststocking survival of FD in a small, spring-fed lake was assessed by gill netting in the spring after fall stocking. No significant difference in overwinter survival was noted between diploid and triploid FD. Overall. the data indicate that triploid SC, FD, and TS rainbow trout perform equally well in the hatchery as diploid fish.																			1522-2055					JAN	2006	68	1					63	73		10.1577/A05-026.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/A05-026.1													WOS:000235596400010

In this paper we compare 245 continental hydrological records and 11 long and continuous continental and marine cores with results from the IPSL general circulation model to discuss hydrological changes between 59 and 29 ka in North Tropical Africa, North (Mediterranean) Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Despite a generally glacial context, wet conditions widely expanded giving place to numerous lakes, rivers and wetlands. The major result of our study is to show that humid conditions appeared much earlier and were more prevalent in the Arabian Peninsula than in Africa, due to the conjunction of monsoon rains in summer and Mediterranean rains in winter. The mechanisms driving MIS 3 humidity in our study area involve global cooling factors such as greenhouse concentrations and ice volume, which have impacted available moisture, orbital forcing, which impacts monsoon circulation and amplitude and sensitivity to the state of the AtlanticMeridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).					; Lézine, Anne-Marie/A-5618-2013	LEZINE, Anne-Marie/0000-0002-3555-5124; 													1631-0713	1778-7025					2023	355				2		229	246		10.5802/crgeos.240	http://dx.doi.org/10.5802/crgeos.240													WOS:001167673800011

However, few individuals were generally recorded per 1 m(3) of water. Bryocamptus minutus was the most abundant species of copepod at an esker site, the other species recorded being Attheyella crassa, Bryocamptus pygmaeus, Moraria brevipes and Parastenocaris phyllura, and some species from the genus Diacyclops. At a shore bank infiltration site M. brevipes was the most numerous species. However, one esker site examined did not have any animals. Springs, which were grouped into those in a natural state and those under anthropogenic influence, had some species in common with esker groundwater, but also Paracyclops fimbriatus, Acanthocyclops robustus, Acanthocyclops vernalis, Diacyclops bicuspidatus, Megacyclops viridis, and the harpacticoid species Bryocamptus cuspidatus, Bryocamptus echinatus and Canthocamptus staphylinus. Of the spring copepods, P. fimbriatus appeared to withstand the influence of road de-icing with NaCl, but numbers of Moraria brevipes were reduced under this influence. Bryocamptus echinatus was more numerous in springs having a high oxygen content and high pH. The species found in esker groundwaters and springs were in part the same evidently cold-stenotherm species which inhabit the profundal zone of oligotrophic lakes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Neotropical ostracode oxygen and carbon isotope signatures: implications for calcification conditions	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Calcitic valves of non-marine ostracodes are important geochemical archives. Investigations of the relationship between the ranges of oxygen and carbon isotope values of modern ostracode populations and their host water provide important information on local or regional conditions and influences. Here we present the first delta O-18(ostracode) and delta C-13 of the freshwater ostracode species Cytheridella ilosvayi along with the isotopic composition of the waters in which the ostracodes calcified, delta D-water, delta O-18(water), delta C-13(DIC) values-covering a large geographical range (Florida to Brazil). With this data we extended a newly developed approach based on the estimation of delta O-18 values of monthly equilibrium calcites as references for the interpretation of delta O-18(ostracode) values. The expected apparent oxygen isotope fractionation between CaCO3 and H2O is correlated with temperature with smaller values occurring at higher temperatures as valid at isotope equilibrium (delta O-18(calcite)_(eq)). Uncertainties about the expected equilibrium calcites derive from incomplete knowledge of high-frequency variations of the water bodies caused by interplay of mixing, evaporation, and temperature. Coincidence between delta O-18(ostracode) and delta O-18(calcite)_(eq) is restricted to few months indicating a seasonal calcification of Cytheridella. There is a characteristic pattern in its difference between mean delta O-18(ostracode) and delta O-18(calcite)_(eq) which implies that Cytheridella provides a synchronous life cycle in its geographical range with two calcification periods in spring (May, June) and autumn (October). This ubiquitous life cycle of Cytheridella in the entire study area is considered to be phylogenetically inherited. It might have originally been adapted to environmental conditions but has been conserved during the migration and radiation of the group over the Neotropical realm.

The geographic distributions of summer precipitation around both 9kaBP and 4kaBP were realistically captured by CAM2, compared to the proxy data collected from 80 stations. Among all orbital parameters, the precession plays a major role in computing solar radiation, which dominates the variations of summer precipitation over China during the Holocene. The summers around 9kaBP were the wettest in China. Later on, the precipitation gradually reduced to the minimum around 0kaBP by about 10%. This tremendous change occurred from the Northeast China and the eastern Inner Mongolia extending southwestwards to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, especially over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.					; Yang, Bao/O-1541-2013; ZHOU, Tianjun/C-3195-2012; LIU, ZHIPENG/GWQ-5972-2022; Huang, Jianbin/AAP-5941-2020; Ren, Guoyu/J-9953-2012	Ren, Guoyu/0000-0002-9351-4179; ZHOU, Tianjun/0000-0002-5829-7279; 													1006-8775					JUN	2011	17	2					103	112		10.3969/j.issn.1006-8775.2011.02.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.3969/j.issn.1006-8775.2011.02.002													WOS:000291934900002
J	JAMES, WF; BARKO, JW				JAMES, WF; BARKO, JW			SEDIMENT RESUSPENSION, REDEPOSITION, AND FOCUSING IN A SMALL DIMICTIC RESERVOIR	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Rates of seston (dry mass) sedimentation, estimated from sediment traps (ST rates) and sediment cores (SC rates), were determined at four water depths to examine seasonal and annual sedimentation patterns in Eau Galle Reservoir, Wisconsin (USA). Annual ST rates overestimated annual SC rates at water depths less-than-or-equal-to 4 m, suggesting that sediment resuspension and redeposition in relatively shallow regions of the reservoir caused the overestimate. In contrast, annual ST and SC rates were similar at depths >4 m, suggesting minimal sediment resuspension and redeposition in deeper regions of the reservoir. Using variations in daily ST rates estimated during the autumn overturn of 1987, we developed a conceptual framework for estimating sediment resuspension, redeposition, and focusing. Resuspension of shallow sediments during this particular period accounted for over 50% of the annual ST rate at depths less-than-or-equal-to 4 m. At the same time, focusing of resuspended shallow sediments to deeper regions accounted for about 20% of the annual ST rate at depths >4 m. Our results indicate that during autumn overturn in this reservoir, peaks in sedimentation in the deep, profundal region, estimated from sediment traps, may reflect sediment focused from shallow regions rather than sediment resuspended from the profundal region.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAY	1993	50	5					1023	1028		10.1139/f93-118	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f93-118													WOS:A1993LR75800017

Scott			Pollen and macrofossil evidence of Late Pleistocene and Holocene treeline fluctuations from an alpine lake in Colorado, USA	HOLOCENE												High-resolution pollen, plant macrofossil and magnetic susceptibility (MS) data are presented from an alpine lake sediment core from west-central Colorado, recording changes in vegetation and sedimentation for the latest Pleistocene and Holocene (c. the last 12.5 ka; 1 ka = 1000 cal. yr BP). During the Younger Dryas chron (c. 12.9-11.5 ka), Artemisia steppe or tundra grew around the lake, but by the earliest Holocene (10.7-9.5 ka) a subalpine Picea and Abies parkland was established there. Picea remained important through the early Holocene, but also bristlecone and lodgepole pines (Pinus aristata and P. contorta) grew around the lake. Warming conditions are indicated from 9.5 ka, lasting until c. 4.5-3.5 ka, which may have been the warmest period, with greatest development of monsoonal conditions. Trees subsequently retreated downslope from Kite Lake c. 150-200 m during the last 3.5 ka, establishing their present treeline position. A decrease in total Pinus and increases in Artemisia and pinon (P. edulis) indicate a trend toward progressive climate cooling and enhanced winter precipitation. These long-term climatic trends correlate with Holocene changes in summer insolation.

G.; Lohmann, Rainer			Significance of Population Centers As Sources of Gaseous and Dissolved PAHs in the Lower Great Lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Polyethylene passive samplers (PEs) were used to measure concentrations of gaseous and dissolved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the air and water throughout the lower Great Lakes during summer and fall of 2011. Atmospheric Sigma(15)PAH concentrations ranged from 2.1 ng/m(3) in Cape Vincent (NY) to 76.4 ng/m(3) in downtown Cleveland (OH). Aqueous Sigma(18)PAH concentrations ranged from 2.4 ng/L at an offshore Lake Erie site to 30.4 ng/L in Sheffield Lake (OH). Gaseous PAH concentrations correlated strongly with population within 3-40 km of the sampling site depending on the compound considered, suggesting that urban centers are a primary source of gaseous PAHs (except retene) in the lower Great Lakes region. The significance of distant population (within 20 km) versus local population (within 3 km) increased with subcooled liquid vapor pressure. Most dissolved aqueous PAHs did not correlate significantly with population, nor were they consistently related to river discharge, wastewater effluents, or precipitation. Air water exchange calculations implied that diffusive exchange was a source of phenanthrene to surface waters, while acenaphthylene volatilized out of the lakes. Comparison of air water fluxes with temperature suggested that the significance of urban centers as sources of dissolved PAHs via diffusive exchange may decrease in warmer months.					; McDonough, Carrie/HLG-7161-2023; Muir, Derek/F-6183-2011; Lohmann, Rainer/B-1511-2008	Muir, Derek/0000-0001-6631-9776; McDonough, Carrie/0000-0001-5152-8495; Lohmann, Rainer/0000-0001-8796-3229													0013-936X	1520-5851				JUL 15	2014	48	14					7789	7797		10.1021/es501074r	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es501074r								24918966					WOS:000339227500016

A chironomid-based reconstruction of summer temperatures in NW Iceland since AD 1650	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Few studies currently exist that aim to validate a proxy chironomid-temperature reconstruction with instrumental temperature measurements. We used a reconstruction from a chironomid percentage abundance data set to produce quantitative summer temperature estimates since AD 1650 for NW Iceland through a transfer function approach, and validated the record against instrumental temperature measurements from Stykkisholmur in western Iceland. The core was dated through Pb-210, Cs-137 and tephra analyses (Hekla 1693) which produced a well-constrained dating model across the whole study period. Little catchment disturbance, as shown through geochemical (Itrax) and loss-on-ignition data, throughout the period further reinforce the premise that the chironomids were responding to temperature and not other catchment or within-lake variables. Particularly cold phases were identified between AD 1683-1710. AD 1765-1780 and AD 1890-1917, with relative drops in summer temperatures in the order of 1.5-2 degrees C. The timing of these cold phases agree well with other evidence of cooler temperatures, notably increased extent of Little Ice Age (LIA) glaciers. Our evidence suggests that the magnitude of summer temperature cooling (1.5-2 degrees C) was enough to force LIA Icelandic glaciers into their maximum Holocene extent, which is in accordance with previous modelling experiments for an Icelandic ice cap (Langjokull).

As the dense inflow passed through the epilimnion of the steep-sided lake, it entrained relatively large quantities of water. The resulting mixture of dense inflow and entrained epilimnetic water sank to the bottom of the lake. The removal of water from the epilimnion due to entrainment reduced the epilimnetic thickness. This opposes the normal process of epilimnetic deepening due to wind and convective cooling. The flux of fluid entrained into the dense inflow was calculated to be between 4 and 14 times the inflow, depending primarily on the thickness of the epilimnion. The entrainment had four major effects: (1) it reduced the residence time of the epilimnion from half a year to less than a month; (2) it removed the freshwater cap that resulted from spring ice melt; (3) it enabled fall turnover, which further enhanced deep oxygen content and helped to prevent meromixis from developing in the lake; and (4) it produced a rapid decline in contaminant (i.e., zinc) concentrations in the epilimnion, which received dissolved metals inputs from oxidized sulfide minerals exposed in the subaerial walls of the lake. Given the wide variety of inflows to inland water bodies, some of which are at least seasonally dense, an understanding of the mechanisms detailed here can inform lake management in general, and more specifically, management of water quality in mine-impacted water bodies.

We examined seasonal monitoring data and a dated sediment core from Lake Poyang, a large floodplain lake located on the Yangtze floodplain in the SE China. Multivariate analysis based on contemporary data (diatoms and water quality) revealed that the seasonal changes in the diatom assemblage of the lake were correlated with water temperature and Secchi depth (SD), although the weak spatial effect was not negligible. During the dry winter season, low water temperature, low SD, and high nutrient levels, were accompanied by high abundances of planktonic Aulacoseira species along with Stephanodiscus hantzschii, a species well adapted to cold and eutrophic waters. During the summer wet season, however, when water temperature and SD were high and nutrient levels low, benthic and epiphytic diatoms, such as the genus Achnanthes, dominated. Sediment records of diatoms and geochemistry were used to estimate long-term variation in the ecological condition of the lake. During the past similar to 60 years, the lake has shifted from a natural hydrologically connected, oligotrophic lake dominated by benthic and epiphytic diatoms to a poorly hydrologically connected, eutrophic state driven by nutrient-tolerant planktonic and eutrophic diatoms. Furthermore, our results indicate that the proposed Poyang dam may severely affect the water quality and ecosystem of the lake by altering its seasonal hydrology.

Bighorn sheep response to road-related disturbances in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) use of Sheep Lakes mineral site, Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, USA, has decreased since 1996. Officials were concerned that human disturbance may have been contributing to this decline in use. We evaluated effects of vehicular traffic and other road-related disturbance on bighorn use of Sheep Lakes in the summers of 2002 and 2003. We found that the time and number of attempts required by bighorn to reach Sheep Lakes was positively related to the number of vehicles and people present at Sheep Lakes. Further, the number of bighorn individuals and groups attempting to visit Sheep Lakes were negatively affected by disturbance associated with the site. The number of vehicles recorded the hour before bighorn tried to access Sheep Lakes best predicted an animal's failure to cross Fall River Road and reach Sheep Lakes. We conclude that human and road-related disturbance at Sheep Lakes negatively affected bighorn use of the mineral site. Because Sheep Lakes may be important for bighorn sheep, especially for lamb production and survival, the negative influence of disturbance may compromise health and productivity of the Mummy Range bighorn sheep.																			0022-541X	1937-2817				SEP	2007	71	7					2329	2337		10.2193/2006-486	http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/2006-486													WOS:000249351100029

The apparent activation energies for alkaline phosphatase activity in seawater and sediments were 53.8 and 48.6 kJ mol(-1), respectively. The K-m and V-max were 10.6 mM and 89 mug of 4-nitrophenol g(-1) h(-1) and 8.42 mM and 145 mug of 4-nitrophenol L-1 h(-1) for sediments and seawater, respectively. Both types of enzymatic activity reached high values in seawater and sediments; in the confined areas of the salt-pond the values were around 100 mug of 4-nitrophenol L-1 h(-1) for seawater and higher for sediments. In general, clear seasonal evolutions for both types of enzymatic activity were found in the seawater, with maxima at the end of summer and minima in winter. No seasonal pattern was evident in the sediment. Stratification of phosphorus regeneration was observed in the sediment column but there was no stratification at depths greater than 15 cm.					; Blasco, Julian/A-5319-2008	Gomez-Parra, Abelardo/0000-0002-9814-4218; Blasco, Julian/0000-0002-9750-383X													0185-3880					SEP	2004	30	3					403	416		10.7773/cm.v30i3.332	http://dx.doi.org/10.7773/cm.v30i3.332													WOS:000223682800003
J	Romanov, AA				Romanov, A. A.			Ecological and Geographical Structure and Dynamics of Spring Migration of Water and Semiaquatic Birds on the Putorana Plateau	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												The ecological and geographical differentiation and dynamics of the spring migration of water and semiaquatic birds of the Putorana Plateau are analyzed. In 1988-2007, eight points were surveyed in the northern, southern, western, and eastern parts of the region on an area of 250 000 km2 using the method of route census. The water and semiaquatic avifauna of the Putorana Plateau during the spring migration includes 68 species. The tundra species (53%) from among the Anseriformes and Charadriiformes, accounting for 94%, make a significant contribution to the avifauna formation. Birds fly to the north, east, and west. They make stops at the river deltas that are freed from snow and ice early. The species distributed at stopover sites everywhere (38%), locally (22%), and pointwise (40%) are distinguished. Bird population density at stopovers is from 15 to 227 (on average (n = 8) 94) ind./km of shoreline. The population of birds on lakes is always much smaller than on adjacent river sections. The vast majority of individuals of almost all migratory species are united in monospecific and (rarely) polyspecific flocks. The entire spring migration of water and semiaquatic birds on the Putorana Plateau takes place from May 19 to June 27 and lasts on average (n = 10) 23 days. The main passage runs from May 25 to June 17 and lasts an average of (n = 8) 7 days. Spring migration is most intense in the west of the Putorana Plateau, where at least 20 000-30 000 individuals of aquatic and semiaquatic birds fly through the surveyed points. The passage is much weaker in the center and, especially, in the east of the region. There are 19 species among the dominants of water and semiaquatic habitats, including the common teal, Eurasian wigeon, northern pintail, grey-tailed tattler, and little stint.																			1995-4255	1995-4263				FEB	2024	17	1					1	14		10.1134/S1995425524010116	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1995425524010116													WOS:001184596500009

The Breitenbach is an unpolluted foothill stream in Hesse, Germany, which runs through an area of fine-grained sandstone. The stream lacks a porous, continuously oxygenated, hyporheic zone. Sediment cores were collected at monthly intervals, from September 1990 to August 1991, at four sites along the stream, to depths of 10 cm. They were subdivided into 2 cm layers, and live Ciliata were counted directly in diluted samples. Their abundance varied greatly, the observed maximum being about 4000/ml sediment in March 1991. There was no longitudinal gradient of ciliate abundance, and it showed no clear seasonal pattern at one site; but at the other three sites it peaked in spring and early summer. At two sites, bacterivorous Ciliata were normally dominant, but peak abundances resulted from increased numbers of herbivorous species. Depth distribution of Ciliata peaked in the 0-2 cm sediment layer. Some so-called sapropelic taxa (genera Metopus, Brachonella and Caenomorpha) were normally observed only below 2 cm depth; but during periods of low discharge they also occurred in the top layer of sediment. Biomass was up to 170 mu g wet weight/ml sediment. Small ciliata (< 60 mu m) were strongly dominant all the time, and seasonal variation of biomass was essentially parallel to numerical abundance.																			0932-4739					DEC 7	1998	34	4					436	445		10.1016/S0932-4739(98)80012-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0932-4739(98)80012-6													WOS:000077910200011

E-0 (mm) has been calculated according to Ivanov's formula based on the monthly values of air temperature (t, degrees C) and relative air humidity (f, %) for six weather stations of the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management. The data were collected using the Statistica software ver. 13 and the QGIS software ver. 3.80. The results indicate statistically significant trends in the increase of E-0 during the period 1952-2018, and that it is particularly high during the spring and summer months, which should be associated with a statistically significant increase in air temperature and a decrease in relative humidity at all examined stations. The results also indicate an exceptionally high increase in evaporation since the end of the 20th century and in the 21st century, which reflects a potentially higher risk of permanent changes in hydrological conditions. The research results point to the major role of climatic factors in the often-dramatic decreases in water resources observed in the 21st century, particularly in lakes and small watercourses. The progressing reduction of water resources may cause permanent changes in physical and chemical conditions in waterbodies.

J	Sommaruga, R; Psenner, R				Sommaruga, R; Psenner, R			Ultraviolet radiation in a high mountain lake of the Austrian Alps: Air and underwater measurements	PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY												Global UV radiation was measured with a portable multichannel filter radiometer at the surface and underwater in a high mountain lake (2417 m above sea level) of the Austrian Alps during 16 days in summer 1995. During this period, total column ozone values that changed only by 34 Dobson units explained a significant part of the variability in UVB radiation at 305 mm as indicated by the negative correlation with the ratio 305:340 nm (r(s) = -0.810, P < 0.01). High radiation at the surface combined with high water transparency allowed substantial UVB radiation to reach the bottom of this lake. The diffuse attenuation coefficient for downward irradiance at 305 mn changed within 2 weeks from 0.24 m(-1) (10% at 9.6 m depth) to 0.32 m(-1) (10% at 7.2 m depth). This change in attenuation was related to the development of phytoplankton after the ice break-up as indicated by a six-fold increase in chlorophyll-a concentrations during this period. Our results suggest that phytoplankton and/or phytoplankton-derived organic substances are important for the UV attenuation in this oligotrophic lake.

There is an urgent need to understand the fate of BPs in the aquatic environment. In this study, we studied the biodegradation of eight BPs in Taihu Lake and discussed the effect of humic acid (HA), which was extracted from Taihu Lake sediment, on the disappearance of BPs. Under aerobic conditions, bisphenol AF (BPAF) and bisphenol S (BPS) were recalcitrant to biodegradation in the lake water. The half-lives for bisphenol F (BPF), bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol B (BPB), bisphenol E (BPE), bisphenol Z (BPZ), and bisphenol M (BPM) ranged from 34 to 75 days in the Taihu Lake water collected in October 2018 and 12-72 days in that collected in May 2019. The biodegradation of BPs in summer was significantly higher than that in autumn. The presence of HA promoted the disappearance of BPs from Taihu Lake water by adsorbing and binding BPs. The disappearance rate of BPs accelerated with increasing concentrations of HA. However, the presence of HA decreased the biodegradation of BPs. When the concentration of HA was 10 mg/L, the single-adsorption capacities for BPS, BPA, BPB, BPM and BPAF were 3.18-10.33 mg/g in the Taihu Lakewater with little desorption. BP adsorption and desorption in the BP mixtures were different from that in the single BPs. Competitive desorption occurred among the mixtures. The results of this study are the first to indicate the biodegradation of eight BPs in natural lake water and the possible effect of HA on the fate of BPs in the environment. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

J	Sergio, F				Sergio, F			Relationship between laying dates of black kites Milvus migrans and spring temperatures in Italy:: rapid response to climate change?	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY												Many Holarctic bird species have been shown to be laying progressively earlier in response to global warming. Most studies have been conducted on small-bodied species at northern latitudes. In Italy, black kite Milvus migrans populations are concentrated near large pre-Alpine lakes, whose water temperatures have been increasing steadily in recent decades. Annual black kite laying dates have become 10-11 days earlier during the last nine years. This shift was related to temporal variations in spring air temperatures, with earlier laying in warmer springs. The progressive advancement in laying dates was not associated with an increase in population level productivity, despite the fact that productivity declined with laying date at the individual territory level within years. Avian response to climate change may be occurring more rapidly than previously thought, even in relatively long-lived species, and not only at the most northern latitudes or highest elevations. Because this change has occurred so rapidly, and because laying dates match annual variations in spring temperatures, the response must be facultatively driven by prevailing conditions, rather than genetic in response to natural selection.

In these regions, Tychonema bourrellyi was identified only recently, with anatoxin-a (ATX-a) producing populations developing with high biomasses in spring and early summer. The increasing development of T. bourrellyi and the associated risk for ATX-a exposure may have a negative impact on the use of water resources. In this regard, recent molecular tools proved to be suitable for the analysis and surveillance of toxigenic microorganisms, providing significant advances in water quality management. In this study, we designed species-specific primers based on the rbcLX genes, for the identification and cell quantification of T. bourrellyi in environmental samples, for PCR and qPCR (SYBR Green) applications. The application of this assay for environmental analyses was validated on Lake Garda samples, showing a significant correlation with densities estimated by light microscopy (LM). Moreover, densities estimated by both LM and qPCR were highly correlated with concentrations of ATX-a. This sensitive method can be used for the long-term study of T. bourrellyi population dynamics, and its fast monitoring in the alpine region, improving risk assessment evaluations and the management of waters.

J	Opdal, AF; Lindemann, C; Aksnes, DL				Opdal, Anders Frugard; Lindemann, Christian; Aksnes, Dag L.			Centennial decline in North Sea water clarity causes strong delay in phytoplankton bloom timing	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												With climate warming, a widespread expectation is that events in spring, such as flowering, bird migrations, and insect bursts, will occur earlier because of increasing temperature. At high latitudes, increased ocean temperature is suggested to advance the spring phytoplankton bloom due to earlier stabilization of the water column. However, climate warming is also expected to cause browning in lakes and rivers due to increases in terrestrial greening, ultimately reducing water clarity in coastal areas where freshwater drain. In shallow areas, decreased retention of sediments on the seabed will add to this effect. Both browning and resuspension of sediments imply a reduction of the euphotic zone and Sverdrup's critical depth leading to a delay in the spring bloom, counteracting the effect of increasing temperature. Here, we provide evidence that such a transparency reduction has already taken place in both the deep and shallow areas of the North Sea during the 20th century. A sensitivity analysis using a water column model suggests that the reduced transparency might have caused up to 3 weeks delay in the spring bloom over the last century. This delay stands in contrast to the earlier bloom onset expected from global warming, thus highlighting the importance of including changing water transparency in analyses of phytoplankton phenology and primary production. This appears to be of particular relevance for coastal waters, where increased concentrations of absorbing and scattering substances (sediments, dissolved organic matter) have been suggested to lead to coastal darkening.

Here we assess the role of weather conditions on the distribution and abundance of the enigmatic glossy ibis (Plegadis falcinellus) in Northeast Algeria in both wintering grounds and in breeding areas in a survey spanning from 2011 to 2019. During the study period, cooler years were wetter and warmer years were drier. The wintering population size in the region could be estimated to 200-300 individuals. The number of individuals in wintering grounds increased in recent years in one site (Berrihane), but it did not show a strong association with weather conditions prior to wintering. Four breeding colonies were detected in highly-vegetated ponds with in-water trees where the number of breeding pairs was the highest. Extinction was recorded for two colonies (50% of colonies) where one permanently disappeared and one exhibited a series of extinctions and recolonizations across years. The estimated colony size was larger at El Dakhla (60-105 pairs) than El Chatt (0-42 pairs), Fezara Lake (25-41 pairs), and Tonga Lake (0-2 pairs). Climate conditions seemed to correlate with the number of pairs in one site (El Chatt) such that warm and dry years were associated with lower number of individuals. We discuss that disturbance and pollution might play a role in colony establishment but the number of pairs is positively related to the extinction of a nearby colony, suggesting that those refuge colonies are crucial for the persistence of the species in the area. This study presents historical data on the occurrence and abundance of a relatively unstudied species and gives new information on its climatic sensitivity which might be helpful for predicting future climate change impacts.					; Abdelkrim, SI BACHIR/AAI-5826-2020; atoussi, sadek/O-3901-2019; Zebsa, Rabah/ABD-4489-2021	Zebsa, Rabah/0000-0001-8214-9500; Si Bachir, Abdelkrim/0000-0001-8501-1830; Bensakhri, Zinette/0000-0001-5024-1329													1505-2249					DEC	2021	69	3-4					193	204		10.3161/15052249PJE2021.69.3.005	http://dx.doi.org/10.3161/15052249PJE2021.69.3.005													WOS:000806055300005

Generalized Additive Models of Climatic and Metabolic Controls of Subannual Variation in pCO2 in Productive Hardwater Lakes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Spatiotemporal variation in climate and weather, allochthonous carbon loads, and autochthonous factors such as lake metabolism (photosynthesis and respiration) interacts to regulate atmospheric CO2 exchange of lakes. Understanding this interplay in diverse basin types at different timescales is required to adequately place lakes into the global carbon cycle and predict CO2 flux through space and time. We analyzed 18years of data from seven moderately hard lakes in an agricultural prairie landscape in central Canada. We applied generalized additive models and sensitivity analyses to evaluate the roles of metabolic and climatic drivers in regulating CO2 flux at the intra-annual scale. At mean conditions with respect to other predictors, metabolic controls resulted in uptake of atmospheric CO2 when surface waters exhibited moderate primary production but released CO2 only when primary production was very low (<8g/L or when dissolved nitrogen was elevated (>2,000g/L), implying that respiratory controls offset photosynthetic CO2 uptake under these conditions. Climatically, dry conditions increased the likelihood of in-gassing, likely due to evaporative concentration of base cations and/or reduced allochthonous carbon loads. While more research is required to establish the relative importance of climate and metabolism at other timescales (diel, autumn/winter), we conclude that these hard fresh waters characteristic of continental interiors are mainly affected by metabolic drivers of pCO(2) at daily-monthly timescales, are climatically controlled at interannual intervals, and are more likely to in-gas CO2 for a given level of algal abundance than are soft water, boreal ecosystems.					; Leavitt, Peter/A-1048-2013; Simpson, Gavin/KFQ-1110-2024	Sauer, Heather/0000-0002-0208-8179; Hayes, Nicole/0000-0002-5664-9939; Simpson, Gavin/0000-0002-9084-8413; Finlay, Kerri/0000-0001-6835-8832; Leavitt, Peter/0000-0001-9805-9307; Wiik, Emma/0000-0001-5359-6678													2169-8953	2169-8961				JUN	2018	123	6					1940	1959		10.1029/2018JG004506	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JG004506													WOS:000438667200011

Dynamics of purple sulfur bacteria in a meromictic saline Lake Shunet (Khakassia, Siberia) in 2007-2013	MICROBIOLOGY												According to the results of seasonal monitoring, in 2007-2013 purple sulfur bacteria morphologically similar to Thiocapsa sp. Shira_1 (AJ633676 in EMBL/GenBank) predominated in the anoxygenic phototrophic community of the water column of the meromictic Lake Shira (Khakassia, Siberia). No pronounced seasonal periodicity in the total cell number in the water column was revealed during the period of observation. In some years cell number during the period when the lake was covered with ice was reliably higher than in summer. The absence of seasonal periodicity was probably due to the low amplitude of seasonal variations in temperature and illumination in the redox zone, resulting from its relatively deep location (12-16 m). The year-to-year dynamics was characterized by a reliable decrease of the total cell number in 2009-2010 and maxima in 2007 and 2011-2012. Canonical correlation analysis revealed that water temperature in the redox zone was the best predictor of the PSB abundance in Lake Shira. Water temperature, in turn, depended on the depth of mixing of the water column. Intense mixing in 2009-2011 was probably responsible for decreased PSB abundance in the lake. On the other hand, the absence of deep winter mixing, resulting in stable conditions in the chemocline, favored the preservation of relatively high PSB biomass. Prediction of circulation depth, which depends mainly on the weather conditions and dynamics of the water level, is required for prediction of PSB abundance in Lake Shira. These results may be useful for paleolimnological reconstructions of the history of the lake based on the remnants of purple sulfur bacteria in bottom sediments.

Artificial waterway design affects fish assemblages in urban estuaries	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Fishes were collected from residential canal estates leading directly off natural estuaries and artificial lakes with control tidal exchange in south-east Queensland, Australia, to test the model that the difference in artificial waterway design affects fish assemblages. A total of 17 779 fish representing 52 species was caught, including 23 species of economic importance (45% of the catch). Total fish abundance and species richness differed little among sites within or between the two artificial habitats (canals and lakes) in either of the seasons sampled (winter and spring). Multivariate analysis showed, however, that assemblages differed among sites within the same artificial habitat. The differences were best explained by the distance sites were from open water, while salinity, water temperature and dissolved oxygen explained little of the variability. Most species were found in canals and lakes, but there were enough differences in composition between the habitats to detect a difference in both seasons (significant ANOSIM tests). Salinity was lower in lakes because of the tidal restrictions, and while this was only weakly correlated with differences in fish assemblages, it had the most explanatory power of any environmental variable. New recruits arrived later in lakes than canals, perhaps because of the barriers to tidal flow. A survey the following year showed that differences among individual lakes were consistent through time, offering insights into the influence of different tidal barriers on fish assemblages. The design change from canals to lakes has a minor influence on fish assemblages and alters the timing of recruitment.

The results show centennial variations in ISM precipitation, with two remarkably dry intervals from 750 to 1167 AD and from 1733 AD to the present and two relatively wet intervals from 898 BC to 750 AD and from 1167 to 1733 AD. A comparison between the record at Lake Lugu and the pollen record at Lake Erhai (both in the northwestern Yunnan Province) suggests that dry climate conditions prevailed during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and over the last 100-200 years, whereas relatively humid conditions prevailed during the Little Ice Age (LIA). These characteristics are generally similar to those of the climate patterns in extensive areas dominated by the ISM (e.g., southwestern-southern China, southeastern-southern Tibetan Plateau, northeastern India Himalayas, southern Oman, and equatorial eastern Africa), but anti-phased with the climate patterns in the wide areas dominated by the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) (e.g., northern-northeastern China and north-central Japan). We speculate that both the variations in the sea surface temperature (SST) over the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean, the ocean atmosphere coupling processes and the migration of the mean position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) should be responsible for the hydroclimatic contrasts over the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) region on centennial timescales during the last 2,000 years.

J	Mei, Y; Lu, JK; Han, D; Xu, LL; Han, YH				Mei, Yi; Lu, Junke; Han, Dan; Xu, Lili; Han, Yuhang			Research on the spatial form effects of thermal comfort on urban waterfront trails in summer - a case study of West Lake in Hangzhou, China	JOURNAL OF ASIAN ARCHITECTURE AND BUILDING ENGINEERING												The waterfront trail is a crucial outdoor activity area for urban residents, but the increasing high temperature in summer has negatively affected the quality of outdoor activities. To address this issue, this article examines the relationship between the spatial form of the waterfront trails and thermal comfort, using the West Lake Hangzhou trails as an example. Seven waterfront trail spaces were selected for the study, and six spatial structure parameters and three climatic parameters were measured on three representative summer days. The Rayman model was then used to calculate the Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) value of each sample plot based on five climate parameters, human body parameters, and Sky View Factor (SVF). The results indicate that the primary spatial form factors affecting the microclimate and thermal comfort of the waterfront trails in summer are the average tree height, the average tree spacing, and the ratio of shadow-generating side tree height to the trail width. The average tree height significantly impacts thermal comfort, followed by the tree spacing and the shadow-generating side tree height ratio to the trail width. These parameters primarily affect the thermal comfort of the waterfront trails through air temperature and wind speed. The study's findings can guide the design of waterfront trail spaces and help create waterfront trails that combine climate comfort and landscape.					韩, 雨航/KHV-3107-2024; Xu, Lili/GYJ-8139-2022	Lu, Junke/0009-0005-3043-9211													1346-7581	1347-2852				MAR 3	2024	23	2					773	788		10.1080/13467581.2023.2238035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13467581.2023.2238035		JUL 2023											WOS:001039559000001

Trace Element Concentrations in Wintering Waterfowl from the Great Salt Lake, Utah	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												The Great Salt Lake (GSL) is an important region for millions of migratory waterbirds. However, high concentrations of some trace elements, including Hg and Se, have been detected within the GSL, and baseline ecotoxicological data are lacking for avian species in this system. We collected common goldeneye (Bucephala clangula), northern shoveler (Anas clypeata), and greenwinged teal (A. crecca) from the GSL during the winters of 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 to evaluate sources of variation in liver trace element concentrations. Hg concentrations were among or exceeded the highest values reported in the published literature for common goldeneye, northern shoveler, and green-winged teal. Average Hg (total) concentrations of common goldeneye peaked in midwinter, whereas average Se concentrations peaked during late winter. During late winter, 100% and 88% of female goldeneye contained elevated concentrations of Hg [>= 1.0 mu g/g wet weight (ww)] and Se (>= 3.0 mu g/g ww), respectively, and 5% and 14% contained potentially harmful amounts of Hg (>= 30.0 mu g/g ww) and Se (> 10.0 mu g/g ww), respectively. Similarly, 30% and 16% of male goldeneye contained potentially harmful concentrations of Hg and Se, respectively. Concentrations of Hg and Se were elevated in 100% and 79%, respectively, of northern shoveler samples (sexes combined) collected during February. We suggest that waterfowl contain biologically concerning amounts of Hg and Se during winter while on the GSL and further research is needed to evaluate the effect of these elements on GSL waterbirds.

J	BRUN, GL; HOWELL, GD; ONEILL, HJ				BRUN, GL; HOWELL, GD; ONEILL, HJ			SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF ORGANIC CONTAMINANTS IN WET PRECIPITATION IN ATLANTIC CANADA	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Wet precipitation samples were collected on a monthly basis from three locations in Atlantic Canada for the period 1980-1989 and analyzed for organochlorine pesticides, total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlorinated benzenes, and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The compounds most commonly detected included the pesticide lindane (gamma-HCH) and its decomposition product alpha-HCH, fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, and PCBs. Statistical analysis of alpha-HCH and gamma-HCH data indicated a significant decrease in concentration of these compounds after 1983, probably the result of curtailing the agricultural use of lindane in North America and on other continents. Seasonal patterns were observed with maximum concentrations/loadings occurring during the spring and fall. Fluoranthene was the dominant PAH compound and was detected in almost every sample. Fluoranthene and other PAHs were shown to follow seasonal patterns, with increasing concentrations during the colder months of the year (December to April). Spatial influences were also observed, indicating both localized and long-range atmospheric source inputs. Abnormally high annual mean concentrations of PCBs ranging between nondetectable levels and 0.220-mu-g/L were measured during the 1981-1986 period at the Prince Edward Island station. Spatial variations for PCBs in the Atlantic Region were significant and attributed in part to localized source inputs. Seasonal patterns similar to the PAHs were also observed. Concentrations dropped to nondetectable levels after 1984 at all sites with the exception of a few sporadic observations.																			0013-936X					JUL	1991	25	7					1249	1261		10.1021/es00019a004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00019a004													WOS:A1991FU94500012
J	Gu, JJ; Zhou, LZ				Gu, Jingjing; Zhou, Lizhi			Intestinal Microbes of Hooded Cranes (Grus monacha) Wintering in Three Lakes of the Middle and Lower Yangtze River Floodplain	ANIMALS												Simple Summary Intestinal microbes are critical to host health, and are affected by environmental factors. In this study, we investigated the intestinal microbes of Hooded Cranes wintering at three lakes with different environmental characteristics in the middle and lower Yangtze River floodplain in China, aiming to provide insights into the effects of habitat size and protection status of birds on their intestinal microbes. We found that the Hooded Cranes at the smaller lake had higher intestinal bacterial and fungal diversity than those at the larger lake. In addition, more diverse and abundant pathogens were found in the gut of Hooded Cranes that lived in the relatively poorly protected habitat than those that lived in well-protected habitat. This study contributes a new perspective for understanding the intestinal microbes of wintering migratory waterbirds at different habitats, and will help to understand the survival status of the vulnerable waterbirds at different habitats for their better conservation. Intestinal microbes participate in life activities of the host, and are affected by external environmental factors. Different habitat sizes and protection status provide different external environmental selection pressures for the same wintering waterbirds, which may be reflected in their intestinal microbes. Hooded Cranes are vulnerable migratory waterbirds with similar numbers wintering at three different lakes in the middle and lower Yangtze River floodplain, Poyang, Caizi, and Shengjin Lakes. Here, we analyzed the characteristics of intestinal bacterial and fungal communities of Hooded Cranes wintering at the three lakes to clarify the effect of habitat size and protection status on intestinal microbes, using high-throughput sequencing technology. Our results showed that community composition and diversity of intestinal microbes were significantly different among lakes with different habitat size and protection status. The Hooded Cranes at Shengjin Lake (small) had higher intestinal microbial alpha-diversity (for both bacteria and fungi) than those at Poyang Lake (large), which might be induced by social behavior of more waterbirds per unit area. The Hooded Cranes at Caizi Lake (relatively poorly protected habitat) had more diverse and abundant intestinal potential pathogens than Shengjin Lake (well-protected habitat). Our results indicated that the environmental pressure of a habitat might affect intestinal microorganisms and more attention might be needed for the vulnerable waterbirds at the habitat of poor protection status.

The accelerating temperature increase trend has driven similar trends in the century-long increase in snow thickness, loss of lake ice, increases in active layer thickness, lake water TOC (total organic carbon) concentrations and the assemblages of diatoms, and changes in tree-line location and plant community structure. Some of these impacts were not evident in the first warm period of the 20th Century. Changes in climate are associated with reduced temperature variability, particularly loss of cold winters and cool summers, and an increase in extreme precipitation events that cause mountain slope instability and infrastructure failure. The long term records of multiple, local environmental factors compiled here for the first time provide detailed information for adaptation strategy development while dramatic changes in an environment particularly vulnerable to climate change highlight the need to adopt global mitigation strategies.

The data suggest that general charcoal levels were low in the late-glacial period and increased steadily through the last 11 000 years with increasing fuel biomass. At local scales, fire occurrence is governed by the interaction of site controls, including vegetation, local climate and fire weather, and topography. At subregional scales, patterns in the long term fire-episode frequency data are apparent: The Coast Range had relatively few fires in the Holocene, whereas the Klamath-Siskiyou region experienced frequent fire episodes. Fire regimes in the northern Rocky Mountains have been strongly governed by millennial- and centennial-scale climate variability and regional differences in summer moisture. At regional scales, sites in present-day summer-dry areas show a period of protracted high fire activity within the early Holocene that is attributed to intensified summer drought in the summer-dry region. Sites in summer-wet areas show the opposite pattern, that fire was lower in frequency than present in the early Holocene as result of strengthened monsoonal circulation then. Higher fire-episode frequency at many sites in the last 2000 years is attributed to greater drought during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and possibly anthropogenic burning. The association between drought, increased fire occurrence, and available fuels evident on several time scales suggests that long-term fire history patterns should be considered in current assessments of historical fire regimes and fuel conditions.					; Bartlein, Patrick/E-4643-2011; Briles, Christy/B-2402-2015	Marlon, Jennifer/0000-0002-8299-9609; Briles, Christy/0000-0003-2596-6349; Bartlein, Patrick/0000-0001-7657-5685; 													1049-8001	1448-5516					2008	17	1					72	83		10.1071/WF07025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF07025													WOS:000253219200008

It commonly forms a dense canopy on the water surface in the growing season (June-September), which hampers the local water quality and habitat of submerged macrophytes, and releases nutrients to the water after death in autumn and winter, resulting in the deterioration of local water quality. At present, there are many and positive research studies on the short-term effects of harvesting water chestnut on water quality and aquatic plants, but long-term observation results are lacking. In response to the above problems, we studied responses of water quality and aquatic plant community to the removal of Trapa in littoral zone of a northern bay in Erhai from August 2014 to January 2017. This could be the first attempt to discover the long-term effects of floating-leaved vegetation management in the freshwater ecosystem. The results showed that the artificial removal of Trapa significantly improved the local water quality in the growing season, for example, the concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), dissolved nitrogen (DN), total phosphorus (TP), and dissolved phosphorus (DP) in the non-Trapa zone (NTZ) were much lower than the concentrations of those in the adjacent Trapa zone (TZ). And the biomass of aquatic macrophyte community (BAMC) was significantly increased in the NTZ, up to the maximum value of about 21 kg/m(2) in fresh weight. However, the diversity indexes of the community in the NTZ declined. Therefore, we suggested that although the removal of Trapa improved the water quality and increased the productivity of the submerged aquatic plant community, it reduced the species diversity of the aquatic plant community in the long run. This is another issue that we need to pay attention to in the later management in Erhai Lake.

Five months under ice: biologging reveals behaviour patterns of overwintering freshwater turtles	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Winter in temperate regions is characteristically the coldest period of the year. Species in these regions adapt to freezing temperatures with physiological or behavioural mechanisms to mitigate the threats of cold exposure. For aquatic species, taking refuge under the ice minimizes the risk of experiencing freeze injury. The northern map turtle (Graptemys geographica (LeSueur, 1817)) is one species that overwinters under the ice of lakes and rivers. Here, we observed the behaviour of free-ranging map turtles at a known overwintering site throughout an entire winter using biologgers equipped with tri-axial acceleration, temperature, and depth sensors. We observed that map turtles maintain localized locomotor activity at the overwintering site continuously during the winter. The extent and patterns of locomotor activity and habitat use varied between adult females, adult males, and juvenile females. Adult females were observed at the shallowest depths, coldest temperatures and moved the least, whereas juvenile females were observed at the deepest depths, warmest temperatures and moved the most. All groups remained at temperatures near freezing (0.98-1.39 degrees C) and at average depths ranging from 1.34 to 1.7 m. These behavioural patterns are consistent with a strategy to survive the winter while remaining aerobic and likely reflect differences in physiological demands.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010; Bulté, Grégory/AAU-4650-2021; MacMillan, Heath/J-6943-2012	Robichaud, Jessica/0000-0002-9721-6873; Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659													0008-4301	1480-3283				2022 OCT 27	2022										10.1139/cjz-2022-0100	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2022-0100		OCT 2022											WOS:000930641300001

MODERN RECORDS OF THE EUROPEAN HEDGEHOG (ERINACEUS EUROPAEUS, ERINACEIDAE, EULIPOTYPHLA) IN SOUTHEASTERN FENNOSCANDIA	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												Southeastern Fennoscandia, which encompasses the Republic of Karelia and the adjacent districts of the Leningrad and Arkhangelsk regions, until lately remained an area of Russia's European North especially poorly prospected as regards the status of the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus). Modern (20012022) records of this species obtained through the authors' original observations and based on reports received from respondents, altogether covering 212 hedgehogs and 182 encounters, are analyzed. Spatio-temporal patterns in the species' records in the region are demonstrated, viz. an expanding distribution area and a growing frequency of encounters from northwest to southeast. The northernmost records are shown (64.368 degrees N, 30.383 degrees E), including yearlings (63.624 degrees-63.924 degrees N, 30.466 degrees-30.901 degrees E, northern taiga subzone), as well as the first reports of the species east of Lake Onego both in Karelia and the Arkhangelsk Region. The studies have revealed habitat preferences and the rate of use of urban territories in the north of the distribution range: high shares of records come from deciduous (34.0% of the total number of animals reported) and mixed (19.3%) forest sites, as well as farmland (10.8%), second-home communities (16.5%), and rural settlements (9.0%). Hedgehog encounters in cut-over places, pine and spruce stands, wetlands, abandoned hamlets, and solitary buildings in the woods were few (0.5-6.1%). Most of the records were a result of accidental sightings by humans (80.8%), while domestic dogs spotted 19.2% of the hedgehogs. The earliest encounters in spring were recorded on 25.04-11.05, the latest in autumn on 2-17.09. The number of hedgehog encounters during their active life period was the lowest in April (1.1%), growing sharply in May and June (16.7 and 17.8%, respectively), peaking in July and August (30.0 and 24.4%), and falling sharply in September (10.0%). Some of the population parameters were determined: an average brood was 2.8 young of the year, whose share amounted to 24.5% of the total number of records; active single animals prevailed among adults (86.3%), and much smaller shares belonged to active pairs (7.6%) and females with litter (6.1%). The main cause of the deaths was road killing by vehicles (77.4%). Climate warming and forest structure alterations may be reasons to expect further expansions of the area of hedgehog encounters, e.g., to transformed and urbanized boreal areas.

Early Holocene humidity patterns in the Iberian Peninsula reconstructed from lake, pollen and speleothem records	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Comparison of selected, well-dated, lacustrine, speleothem and terrestrial pollen records spanning the Holocene onset and the Early Holocene (ca. 11.7-8 cal kyrs BP) in the Iberian Peninsula shows large hydrological fluctuations and landscape changes with a complex regional pattern in timing and intensity. Marine pollen records from Alboran, the Mediterranean and off shore Atlantic sites show a step-wise increase in moisture and forest during this transition. However, available continental records point to two main patterns of spatial and temporal hydrological variability: i) Atlantic-influenced sites located at the northwestern areas (Enol, Sanabria, Lucenza, PRD-4), characterized by a gradual increase in humidity from the end of the Younger Dryas to the Mid Holocene, similarly to most North Atlantic records; and ii) continental and Mediterranean-influenced sites (Laguna Grande, Villarquemado, Fuentillejo, Padul, Estanya, Banyoles, Salines), with prolonged arid conditions of variable temporal extension after the Younger Dryas, followed by an abrupt increase in moisture at 10-9 cal kyrs BR Different local climate conditions influenced by topography or the variable sensitivity (gradual versus threshold values) of the proxies analyzed in each case are evaluated. Vegetation composition (conifers versus mesothermophilous taxa) and resilience would explain a subdued response of vegetation in central continental areas while in Mediterranean sites, insufficient summer moisture availability could not maintain high lake levels and promote mesophyte forest, in contrast to Atlantic-influenced areas. Comparison with available climate models, Greenland ice cores, North Atlantic marine sequences and continental records from Central and Northern Europe and the whole Mediterranean region underlines the distinctive character of the hydrological changes occurred in inner Iberia throughout the Early Holocene. The persistent arid conditions might be explained by the intensification of the summer drought due to the high seasonality contrast at these latitudes caused by the orbital-induced summer insolation maximum. New records, particularly from western and southernmost Iberia, and palaeoclimate models with higher spatial resolution would help to constrain these hypotheses. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Members of the subfamily Goodeinae are a group of small-bodied freshwater fish with specialized reproduction (viviparity- matrotrophy). They are found in the highlands of central Mexico, most of them endemic. The aim of this study was to conduct a comprehensive investigation to evaluate the annual reproductive cycle of seven species of goodeines (splitfins). We carried out our study in the subtropical Lake Zacapu, Mexico, with bimonthly sampling from May 2019 to March 2020. We obtain the fertility, size at first maturity (L50), sex ratio, and gonadosomatic index. Our result shows that populations of goodeines have high fertility compared to other populations of the same species in other aquatic systems and also to other species of goodein. We found that males mature at smaller sizes than females, the observed proportion of females was greater than males in all the goodeines. Lake Zacapu goodeines have two reproductive peaks, one in spring (April to June) and another in fall (September to November). These tactics (fertility rates, sex ratio, reproductive period) and strategies (viviparity-matrotrophy) favor reproductive success in this environmentally stable subtropical lake in the highlands of Mexico.

Annual amplitudes of solar radiation lead to variations of the intertidal H2O2 accumulation with concentrations between 1 and 4 mu mol liter(-1) during summer, while winter concentrations were mostly <0.5 mu mol liter(-1). Diurnal variations of H2O2 accumulation over daily low-tide periods in intertidal environments are determined by the incident solar radiation, the concentration of UV-absorbing dissolved organic carbon in the water, as well as the concomitant biological and chemical H2O2 degradation within the sediment surface. The efficiency of photosynthetic available radiation (PAR), UVA and UVB photons for photochemical H2O2 production was assessed using cut-off filters in the UVB and in different UVA ranges. UVB photons (295-320 nm) displayed an 11-fold higher efficiency compared to UVA (335-370 nm) and a 340-fold higher efficiency compared to PAR photons (>400 nm). A 10% ozone reduction leads to a doubling of UVB surface irradiance at 300 nm, which entails a 30 and 40% increase of the apparent intertidal H2O2 concentrations. Progressive stratospheric ozone depletion via UVB-induced H2O2 formation will have yet unpredictable effects on boreal and Antarctic intertidal ecosystems.

Five major climatic stages were identified: (1) From 12 to 10.5 cal. ka BP, a cold and dry climate prevailed, corresponding to the Younger Dryas in the North Atlantic; (2) from 10.5 to 9.2 cal. ka BP, precipitation increased rapidly but was interrupted by a pronounced cold and dry phase at about 10 cal. ka BP; (3) from 9.2 to 6.2 cal. ka BP, the Holocene climatic optimum was reached and maintained; (4) from 6.2 to 2.5 cal. ka BP, the climate gradually became cooler and drier; (5) from 2.5 cal. ka BP to the present, a climatic reversal toward wetter conditions occurred. The trend of our reconstructed Asian summer monsoon precipitation record is similar on orbital and millennium timescales to that of other records from the Asian monsoon region. Although the maximum monsoon intensity recorded in the Muge Co sediments lagged the peak of Northern Hemisphere insolation by similar to 3.0ka, the strengthening trend was in phase with the rise in the Western Pacific Warm Pool sea surface temperature. Therefore, we suggest that the tropical ocean temperatures may have been the major driver of Asian summer monsoon precipitation in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. In addition, other factors such as sea-level rise and temperature in the North Atlantic region may have played an important role in the evolution of the Asian summer monsoon since the last deglaciation. However, human activity may have affected the monsoon proxies during the last 2.5ka, and further studies are needed to distinguish the effects of climate and human disturbance.

J	Shimada, T				Shimada, T			Daily activity pattern and habitat use of Greater White-fronted Geese wintering in Japan: Factors of the population increase	WATERBIRDS												During 20 years, numbers of Greater White-fronted Geese (Anser albifrons) wintering in Japan have increased 5.6 times (ca. 46,000 in 1999), with over 80% of the geese concentrated around Lake Izunuma-Uchinuma, in northern Japan. Detailed information on the wintering ecology of the geese had not been investigated in Japan and the daily activity pattern and habitat use of the geese were studied around the lake in three winters (October-February), 1996/97, 1997/98 and 1998/99. The daily activity pattern, i.e., flight timing and behavior relating to environmental factors (light intensity, snowfall, temperature and wind speed), was similar to that for several other geese species in temperate areas. The geese wintering in Japan depended exclusively on rice in fields; they foraged in stubble fields, where the density of rice grains was much higher than that in plowed fields. However, the area of stubble fields around the lake has decreased from 1980 to 2000, while combine harvesters replaced machinery, which only cut the rice plants (reapers). The amount of rice grains left in the fields by the combine harvesters was 8.7 times than the reapers. The replaced cropping machinery increased the abundance of food and might facilitate an increase in geese numbers.																			1524-4695					SEP	2002	25	3					371	377		10.1675/1524-4695(2002)025[0371:DAPAHU]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/1524-4695(2002)025[0371:DAPAHU]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000177616500013
J	Bachmann, RW				Bachmann, Roger W.			Climate Change for Lakes in the Coterminous United States in Relation to Lake Warming from 1981 to 2023	WATER												The goal of this study was to look at changes in mean air temperatures, minimum air temperatures, maximum air temperatures, dew points, and precipitation over each of 1033 lakes in the coterminous United States over the summer months in the years 1981-2024. Near-surface water temperatures in the same lakes were calculated with equations using 8-day mean daily air temperatures, latitude, elevation, and the year of sampling. Over the past 43 years, there have been changes in air temperatures over many lakes of the United States with generally increasing trends for minimum air temperatures and mean air temperatures during the months of June through September. The greatest increases have been in daily minimum air temperatures followed by the mean daily air temperatures. Maximum daily air temperatures did not show a statistically significant increase for the summer season but did show a significant increase for the month of September. Along with the changes in the climate, the near-surface water temperatures of the lakes of the United States on average showed increases of 0.33 degrees C decade-1 for the four summer months and increases for each of the summer months.																				2073-4441				JUL 18	2025	17	14							2138	10.3390/w17142138	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17142138													WOS:001539643900001
J	Shafi, ME				Shafi, Manal E.			A comprehensive review of summer mortality syndrome in fish: Causes, climate impact, and mitigation strategies	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED VETERINARY AND ANIMAL RESEARCH												Global warming poses a significant threat to aquatic animals, particularly fish production, because of the rising summer temperatures, leading to issues such as summer mortality syndrome. This issue could impact fish farms, leading to 30%-100% mortality rates and significant financial losses. This study aims to identify the underlying causes of summer mortality syndrome in fish and to evaluate modern mitigation strategies to protect aquaculture systems effectively. Mortality rates of stocked fish ranged between 30% and 70%, with some instances reaching 100%. The reasons behind summer mortality syndrome are complex and multifactorial. Contributing factors include pathogenic agents such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, as well as poor management practices and unfavorable environmental conditions. Most types of bacteria that caused mortality rates in many fish species were Aeromonas spp., Flexibacter columnaris, Flavobacterium columnare, Pseudomonas spp., and Enterobacteriaceae, namely Edwardsiella tarda, Yersinia spp., and Streptococcus spp. To mitigate the impact of this syndrome, several protective measures can be implemented. These include applying some nutritional inventions such as herbal additives, nology, and improved management practices. By addressing these factors comprehensively, the risk of summer mortality syndrome can be significantly reduced. This review provides further evidence regarding the effects of summer mortality syndrome in fish. The main causes of this phenomenon are pathogens and poor management. Nutritional additives and vaccinations were effective ways to mitigate these harmful effects to maintain fish production. Further research is needed to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of these mitigation strategies and to develop guidelines for sustainable fish farming practices under changing climatic conditions.

Impacts on water-column properties	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Two billabongs on the floodplain of the Murrumbidgee River, Australia, were partitioned in half with impermeable plastic barriers for four months from summer to winter 1995. The densities of carp were manipulated to establish high-and low-carp biomass treatments in each billabong. Final standing stocks of carp in the high-and low-carp treatments of each billabong were 1181 and 101 kg ha(-1), and 669 and 348 kg ha(-1), respectively. Turbidity, phytoplankton biomass and total and dissolved phosphorus concentrations were similar in both ends of each billabong before the establishment of the plastic barriers. Throughout the experimental period, turbidity and phytoplankton biomass were significantly higher in the high-carp treatment in both billabongs. However, the two billabongs had different temporal patterns for both turbidity and phytoplankton biomass. Concentrations of total phosphorus were usually greater in the high-carp end of each billabong but there was no consistent pattern for dissolved phosphorus. Carp had a significant impact on turbidity and intensity of algal bloom but this varied with carp biomass and billabong sediment type, and factors other than carp usually contributed to most of the variation in measured water quality.

J	FROST, WE				FROST, WE			THE FOOD OF PIKE, ESOX-LUCIUS L, IN WINDERMERE	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												Food of pike was investigated from 3060 specimens, ranging from 1.05 to 105 cm long collected by gill-net, seine-net and hand-net. Pike of 10.5-17.5 mm feed entirely on Entomostraca. Pike of 20-105 cm feed almost entirely on fishes. Perch occur in diet at all times but predominate from May to Oct., char are eaten only in Nov. and Dec.; trout are eaten to a greater extent from Oct. to Feb.; sticklebacks and minnows are eaten in spring and summer. Such seasonal variations are associated with changes in habit of food spp. Increase in size of pike is associated with increase in size of food organisms eaten. Among pike of 1.05-20 cm this is effected by change from Entomostraca to perch fry; among pike of 20-105 cm there is a change of fish spp. eaten and of size of individuals. Pike selects larger and older individuals of perch and trout populations in lake. 83% of small pike with food in their stomachs compared with 52% for large pike is probably associated with difference in size of food animals eaten. Lowest percentage of feeding fish is found about spawning time, highest after this time. Comparison of fish eaten by pike with those present in lake leads to conclusion that abundance and availability rather than selection by pike determine spp. eaten. Feeding habits of pike have marked effect on survival of fish in Windermere and so affect numbers of spp. and structure of their populations.																			0021-8790	1365-2656					1954	23	2					339	360		10.2307/1985	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1985													WOS:A1954XX16300006
J	Ladouche, B; Aquilina, L; Nathalie, D				Ladouche, Bernard; Aquilina, Luc; Nathalie, Doerfliger			Chemical and isotopic investigation of rainwater in Southern France (1996-2002): Potential use as input signal for karst functioning investigation	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Several recharge processes may be defined for karst systems. However, their respective influence is difficult to determine from spring-water chemistry without a good knowledge of the input signal, i.e. rainfall chemistry. Given the little data published concerning rainfall chemistry in the French Mediterranean area, two rainfall gauges networks were installed - one along a transect from the Mediterranean coast to the most elevated part of the Herault region, which was monitored over two hydrological cycles (1996-1998), and a second on the catchment area of the main karst aquifer of the Gard region (Fontaine de Nimes karst system), which was monitored over four hydrological cycles (1998-2002). The main objective of this study was to characterize the input signal of Mediterranean karst systems by analysing the chemical and isotopic compositions of rainfall, in particular with reference to spatial, intraseasonal and inter-annual variations. Rainwater samples were collected and analysed for major ions, trace elements (B, Br and Sr) and stable water isotopes (delta O-18, delta H-2). The major results of this study are the following: the degree of fluctuation in concentrations of major elements and stable water isotopes in the rainwater depend strongly on elevation and distance from sea. Higher rainfall concentrations are systematically associated with areas nearest to the Mediterranean coast. Rainfall of Atlantic and Mediterranean origins may be differentiated - rainfall of Mediterranean origin is characterized by a higher deuterium excess and generally enriched in heavy isotopes. This rainfall is predominant during the autumn. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Failure Investigation and Rehabilitation of a Steel Sheet Pile Bulkhead	PORTS 2019: PORT ENGINEERING					15th Triennial International Conference on Ports - Connect Innovate Transform	SEP 15-18, 2019	Pittsburgh, PA	PIANC, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Coasts Oceans Ports & Rivers Inst, Ports & Harbors Comm				The United States Coast Guard (USCG) Winter Moorings facility in Algonac, Michigan, consists of a 200-foot (61-meter) long solid-fill wharf owned by the city of Algonac (City) and leased by the USCG. The wharf, comprised of a steel sheet pile bulkhead and timber deck, is used for supporting USCG 140-foot (43-meter) Bay Class Ice Breaking Tugs to break up ice within the Great Lakes and inland waterways. In spring of 2013 the wharf suddenly failed, resulting in substantial settlement of the bulkhead, deck, and backland area, and translation over the entire 200-foot (61-meter) length of the bulkhead. The repair project for the bulkhead featured an aggressive schedule to restore operations to the facility and had a limited construction budget to minimize financial exposure for the leased property. To meet the budgetary constraints, the USCG used an innovative design which included the re-use of suitable portions of the existing anchor system, non-traditional material selection, and a simplified mooring and berthing system. This paper discusses the factors that led to the bulkhead failure; the techniques used to efficiently evaluate the failure; the challenges associated with the design; and the design approaches used to meet the construction budget.																					978-0-7844-8261-2				2019							197	206																WOS:000566206900019

We noted that the spawning period of pumpkinseed commenced earlier in Lake Banyoles than in more northern lakes. Pumpkinseed and freshwater blenny larvae were collected by tow net in both the limnetic (at 4-4.5 m) and littoral zones (at 0-0.5 m), during daylight (no samples were taken during night). Freshwater blenny larvae were more abundant than pumpkinseed larvae. Both of them were more abundant in 1993 than in 1994 (pumpkinseed: 1.61 ind. 100 m(-3) vs. 0.70 ind, 100 m(-3); freshwater blenny: 3.95 ind. 100 m(-3) vs. 1.90 ind. 100 m(-3)) and in both years they were uniformly distributed in the lake, without differences between the areas considered. The pumpkinseed larvae migrated at 3.5 mm TL into the limnetic zone, and returned to the vegetation of the littoral zone as juveniles. The freshwater blenny larvae were also planktonic (3.5-14 mm TL) but were distributed in both the littoral and limnetic zone before benthic settlement. The larval distribution is discussed on the basis of a trade-off between foraging and predation risk.

The physicochemical parameters of the geothermal feature, such as temperature, pH, and heavy metal concentration, can influence the alpha and beta diversity of microbial life in these environments, as can spatiotemporal differences between sites and sampling. In this study, water and sediment samples were collected and analyzed from eight geothermal sites at Yellowstone National Park, including six hot springs, a mud volcano, and an acidic lake within the same week in July 2019, and these geothermal sites varied greatly in their temperature, pH, and chemical composition. All samples were processed and analyzed with the same methodology and taxonomic profiles and alpha and beta diversity metrics determined with 16S rRNA sequencing. These microbial diversity results were then analyzed with respect to pH, temperature, and chemical composition of the geothermal features. Results indicated that predominant microbial species varied greatly depending on the physicochemical composition of the geothermal site, with decreases in pH and increases in dissolved heavy metals in the water corresponding to decreases in alpha diversity, especially in the sediment samples. Similarly, sites with acidic pH values had more similar microbial populations (beta diversity) to one another than to relatively neutral or alkaline pH geothermal sites. This study suggests that pH and/or heavy metal concentration is a more important driver for microbial diversity and population profile than the temperature for these sites and is also the first reported microbial diversity study for multiple geothermal sites in Yellowstone National Park, including the relatively new mud volcano Black Dragon's Caldron, which erupted in 1948.

Modeled tephra ages from lake sediments, base of Redoubt Volcano, Alaska	QUATERNARY GEOCHRONOLOGY												A 5.6-m-long lake sediment core from Bear Lake, Alaska, located 22 km southeast of Redoubt Volcano, contains 67 tephra layers deposited over the last 8750 cal yr, comprising 15% of the total thickness of recovered sediment. Using 12 AMS C-14 ages, along with the Cs-137 and Pb-210 activities of recent sediment, we evaluated different models to determine the age-depth relation of the core, and to determine the age of each tephra deposit. The selected age model is based on a mixed-effect regression that was passed through the adjusted tephra-free depth of each dated layer. The estimated age uncertainty of the 67 tephras averages +/- 105 yr (95% confidence intervals). Tephra-fall frequency at Bear Lake was among the highest during the past 500 yr, with eight tephras deposited compared to an average of 3.7/500 yr over the last 8500 yr. Other periods of increased tephra fall occurred 2500-3500, 4500-5000, and 7000-7500 cal yr. Our record suggests that Bear Lake experienced extended periods (1000-2000 yr) of increased tephra fall separated by shorter periods (500-1000 yr) of apparent quiescence. The Bear Lake sediment core affords the most comprehensive tephrochronology from the base of the Redoubt Volcano to date, with an average tephra-fall frequency of one every 130 yr.

The two populations showed different life-cycle and diapause characteristics. The major differences were found in the number of generations per year (three versus two), the timing of induction and termination of diapause, temperature and oxygen conditions during diapause migration to the sediment, and habitat selection for wintering. Diapause initiation occurred at about 12 h light : 12 h dark in one population, but about 8 h L : 16 h D in the other. Higher habitat temperatures (approximately 5-degrees-C) seemed to allow completion of a further generation in the warmest lake. The population descending early into the hypolimnion utilized the deep profundal sediment as a diapausing habitat. These specimens were most likely physiologically prepared for diapause, including tolerance to low-oxygen or anoxic conditions. The population with an additional generation, probably not yet in the complete diapause phase, avoided low-oxygen conditions and utilized mainly the oxygenated part of the profundal sediment as a diapausing habitat. The major part of both populations diapaused in the sediment, but a small fraction was in ''active diapause'' in the plankton during winter. In these populations of T. oithonoides, day length, modified by habitat temperature, seemed to influence diapause initiation, whereas habitat distribution during winter seemed to be influenced by the combined effect of diapause ontology and oxygen conditions in the potential wintering habitat.																			0008-4301					AUG	1993	71	8					1663	1672		10.1139/z93-233	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z93-233													WOS:A1993LX16800025
J	Campbell, DH; Muths, E; Turk, JT; Corn, PS				Campbell, DH; Muths, E; Turk, JT; Corn, PS			Sensitivity to acidification of subalpine ponds and lakes in north-western Colorado	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Although acidifying deposition in western North America is lower than in many parts of the world, many high-elevation ecosystems there are extremely sensitive to acidification. Previous studies determined that the Mount Zirkel Wilderness Area (MZWA) has the most acidic snowpack and aquatic ecosystems that are among the most sensitive in the region. In this study, spatial and temporal variability of ponds and lakes in and near the MZWA were examined to determine their sensitivity to acidification and the effects of acidic deposition during and after snowmelt. Within the areas identified as sensitive to acidification based on bedrock types, there was substantial variability in acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC), which was related to differences in hydrological flowpaths that control delivery of weathering products to surface waters. Geological and topographic maps were of limited use in predicting acid sensitivity because their spatial resolution was not fine enough to capture the variability of these attributes for lakes and ponds with small catchment areas. Many of the lakes are sensitive to acidification (summer and autumn ANC < 100 mueq L-1), but none of them appeared to be threatened immediately by episodic or chronic acidification. In contrast, 22 ponds had minimum ANC < 30 mueq L-1, indicating that they are extremely sensitive to acidic deposition and could be damaged by episodic acidification, although net acidity (ANC < 0) was not measured in any of the ponds during the study. The lowest measured pH value was 5(.)4, and pH generally remained less than 6(.)0 throughout early summer in the most sensitive ponds, indicating that biological effects of acidification are possible at levels of atmospheric deposition that occurred during the study. The aquatic chemistry of lakes was dominated by atmospheric deposition and biogeochemical processes in soils and shallow ground water, whereas the aquatic chemistry of ponds was also affected by organic acids and biogeochemical processes in the water column and at the sediment-water interface. These results indicate that conceptual and mechanistic acidification models that have been developed for lakes and streams may be inadequate for predicting acidification in less-understood systems such as ponds.

The purpose of this study is to examine the following questions: 1) Do refugees and non-refugees differ in self-rated health? 2) Do refugees and non-refugees differ in cancer risk awareness? and 3) Are lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity participation, and weight status risk or protective factors of cancer risk awareness? Methods. A self-administered or interviewer-administered survey were collected from adults with a refugee background from spring to fall in 2017 in Salt Lake County, Utah. Free clinic data (a non-refugee comparison group) were collected using a self-administered survey from May to June in 2017 from a free clinic in Salt Lake County, Utah. Results. Refugees reported better self-rated health and were less likely to be obese/overweight, have family history of cancer, and have healthy diet. Refugees reported lower levels of cancer risk awareness than free clinic non-refugee patients. Having a healthy diet was associated with higher levels of cancer risk awareness. Conclusion. Future studies should examine cultural differences related to cancer risk awareness among refugee populations.

The thermal springs are a result of a geothermal anomaly developed in the Bile Herculane area, along a narrow and deep graben. In late 1970s, the Romanian government began the construction of the Cerna-Motru-Tismana hydropower system. Dams were built on these rivers, including their main tributaries, forming Cerna Lake and Motru Lake. Waters from the resulting impoundment, Cerna Lake, were directed through tunnels to Motru Lake and then to the power station at Tismana Lake. Due to this anthropogenic impact, the volume of water available to recharge the thermal water reservoir was substantially diminished. A study was requested by the government, to determine the effect of water withdrawal from the Cerna River on the thermal water reservoir and to evaluate potential hydrogeologic connections between the Cerna River, its tributaries, and the thermal water reservoirs. In 1988, an additional dam was built on the Cerna River, 5 km north of Bile Herculane (forming Prisaca Lake) to supply power, water, and recharge the thermal water reservoirs. Selected results of this study, with emphasis on the geology, hydrogeology, and recharge areas of the main springs of MehedinA i pound Mountains south of Arsasca Valley, are presented in this paper. Several sinking streams were identified in the northern part of the study area, near the boundary between non karstifiable rocks and limestones. Monitoring of selected springs during dye studies performed in July 2010 is still ongoing. At the time of publication, no dye had been detected in the monitored springs. The long residence times reflects the complexity of the geology in the area. The sinking stream and the springs being monitored are in limestone units separated by 300 m of low primary permeability flysch deposits.

During February-March 1998 water samples were taken from lakes, rivers, wells, hot springs, and springs. They were analysed for delta D, delta(18)O, and Cl- concentration to determine the contribution of lake water to river discharge and downgradient groundwater field. The results indicate that the influence of leakage from Lake Ikeda is confined to the area east-south of the lake, where a mixing of lake water, local rainwater, and sea water takes place. For certain rivers and springs, lake water contributes more than 80% of the discharge. Many of the wells and hot springs represent a 7-100% lake-water contribution. Leakage of lake water is most likely to occur through the southern caldera walls, where thick volcanic aquifers are hydraulically connected to Lake Ikeda. The study showed that leakage from Lake Ikeda was found to play a predominant role in the groundwater regime of the district.																			0144-7815		1-901502-01-5				1999		258					183	192																WOS:000085488000022

Bloom samples taken in August and September represent healthy bloom biomass, whereas samples from October represent decomposing bloom biomass. To improve our understanding of the complex interior structure in the phycosphere, bloom samples were separated into large (>100 mu m), medium (10-100 mu m) and small (0.2-10 mu m) size aggregates. Species richness and library coverage indicated that pyrosequencing recovered a large bacterial diversity. The community of each size aggregate was highly organized, indicating highly specific conditions within the Microcystis phycosphere. While the communities of medium and small-size aggregates clustered together in August and September samples, large-and medium-size aggregate communities in the October sample were grouped together and distinct from small-size aggregate community. Pronounced changes in the absolute and relative percentages of the dominant genus from the two most important phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were observed among the various size aggregates. Bacterial species on large and small-size aggregates likely have the ability to degrade high and low molecular weight compounds, respectively. Thus, there exists a spatial differentiation of bacterial taxa within the phycosphere, possibly operating in sequence and synergy to catalyze the turnover of complex organic matters.

INSIGHTS INTO THE ECOLOGY OF CRYPTORCHESTIA GARBINII ON THE SHORES OF THE URBAN LAKE TEGEL (BERLIN, GERMANY)	VIE ET MILIEU-LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT												Talitrid amphipods find their optimal zonation in humid substrates, from the supralittoral of sandy beaches, to damp wracks cast up on river and lake banks, to the moist soil of gardens, and are known to adjust behavior in order to fit within a broad range of environmental constraints. The stones along urban shores of Lake Tegel offer shelter to a resident population of Cryptorchestia garbinii; while the stones can offer a stable shelter, the lakeshore undergoes seasonal changes. To investigate how C. garbinii responds and copes with changes in such urban habitat, we carried out a preliminary study to assess mobility and daily activity of a resident population. The population was sampled with pitfall traps, emptied in the morning and in the evening avoiding dusk and dawn. Sampling lasted 48 hours in each season, along one year. A test for survival in water on 14 adults was paired with the summer sampling. A consistent pattern of activity was found: only the traps closest to the stones contained talitrids (including in condition of 0 degrees C air temperature), except in winter when the soil was frozen, incorporating the stones. The night captures were consistently more numerous than the daylight ones. All individuals survived in water, with a female observed to release live offspring. The results indicate a steadily nocturnal mobility, yet limited to less than one meter on the land side. The connectivity potential of this riparian-hopper hence relies either on the alongshore dimension or via water.																			0240-8759						2019	69	2-3					187	191																WOS:000508224800013

Monthly collections of lake sediment cores were made using PVC tubes. Core sections of sample sediments ranged from 76 to 117 cm. The vertical distribution of the worms showed no diurnal variation; therefore diel vertical migration was not evident. Seasonal downward migration started in April, and upward migration started in October. From December to March, almost all worms remained in the near-surface sediment layer (surface to 30 cm deep), while from July to September almost all worms remained deeper than 30 cm. However, few individuals migrated deeper than 90 cm. No discontinuous layers were found in grain size composition, water content, loss on ignition, particulate carbon, nitrogen or phosphorus. In deep sediment there was no free oxygen, as evidenced by negative ORP values. For 4 months in summer, R. hiemalis aestivated, probably utilizing anaerobic respiration. It appeared that R. hiemalis moved deeper in the sediment in response to sediment temperature, because sediment temperatures in the deep layers seemed to converge at around 20-21 degrees C in the summer months. The life history traits of seasonal vertical migration and summer aestivation perhaps arose as an adaptation to the climatic conditions accompanying the geographical origin of R. hiemalis, and they also serve to minimize predation risk during summer when most invertebrate predatory fishes are active.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	2006	564	1					87	93		10.1007/s10750-005-1710-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-1710-3													WOS:000237511800010

We conducted enclosure experiments in a shallow eutrophic lake, in which a biomass gradient of the filter-feeding planktivore, silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix Valenciennes, was created, and subsequent community changes in both zooplankton and phytoplankton were examined. 2. During a summer experiment, a bloom of Anabaena flos-aquae developed (approximate to 8000 cells mL(-1)) solely in an enclosure without silver carp. Concurrent with, or slightly preceding the Anabaena bloom, the number of rotifer species and their abundance increased from seven to twelve species (1700-14 400 organisms L-1) after the bloom in this fish-free enclosure. Protozoans and bacteria were generally insensitive to the gradient of silver carp biomass. 3. During an autumn experiment, on the other hand, large herbivorous crustaceans were more efficient than silver carp in suppressing the algae, partly because the lower water temperature (approximate to 24 degrees C) inhibited active feeding of this warm-water fish and also formation of algal colonies. Heterotrophic nanoflagellate and bacterial densities were also influenced negatively by the crustaceans. 4. Correspondence analysis (CA) was applied to the weekly community data of zooplankton and phytoplankton. A major effect detected in the zooplankton community was the presence/absence of silver carp rather than the biomass of silver carp, whereas that in the phytoplankton community was the fish biomass before the Anabaena bloom, but shifted to the presence/absence of the fish after the bloom.

To elucidate the hydrologic responses to changing climate and the effects on lake mixing processes we measured the stable isotope (delta(18)O and delta D) and tritium concentrations of water and ice samples collected in the Lake Fryxell watershed from 1987 through 1990. Stable isotope enrichment resulted from evaporation in stream and moat samples and from sublimation in surface lake-ice samples. Tritium enrichment resulted from exchange with the postnuclear atmosphere in stream and moat samples. Rapid injection of tritiated water into the upper water column of the lake and incorporation of this water into the ice cover resulted in uniformly elevated tritium contents (>3.0 TU) in these reservoirs. Tritium was also present in deep water, suggesting that a component of bottom water was recently at the surface. During summer, melted lake ice and stream water forms the moat. Water excluded from ice formation during fall moat freezing (enriched in solutes and tritium, and depleted in O-18 and H-2 relative to water below 15-m depth) may sink as density currents to the bottom of the lake. Seasonal lake circulation, in response to climate-driven surface inflow, is therefore responsible for the distribution of both water isotopes and dissolved solutes in Lake Fryxell.

Standing crop was correlated with dissolved P loading when mixing of the water column was taken into account. A regression applicable to lakes of all depth was given as a log-log function with predictive confidence intervals for summer mean values. Boundary conditions for the exclusion of certain lakes were determined. For lakes of mean depth G 25 m areal loading accounted for 97% of the variance in summer phytoplankton standing crop. P inputs to shallower systems were adjusted to give a simple approximation of the influence of mixing processes and the ratio of bottom area to overlying water volume. Annual primary productivity seemed to be a more complex and variable function of P loading than was summer standing crop. The former correlated well with the morphoedaphic index. Productivity and standing crop showed well-defined trends in relation to other variables, but point scatter was so great that more exact definition of these functions was not justified.																									1977	34	12					2255	2270		10.1139/f77-304	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f77-304													WOS:A1977ED63800001

Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), a salmonid well adapted to northern conditions, faces multiple stressors in the Arctic, including water chemistry modifications, that could negatively impact the gill microbiota dynamics related to the host's health. In the context of increasing environmental disturbances, we aimed to characterize the taxonomic distribution of transcriptionally active taxa within the bacterial gill microbiota of Arctic char in the Canadian Arctic in order to identify active bacterial composition that correlates with environmental factors. For this purpose, a total of 140 adult anadromous individuals were collected from rivers, lakes, and bays belonging to five Inuit communities located in four distinct hydrologic basins in the Canadian Arctic (Nunavut and Nunavik) during spring (May) and autumn (August). Various environmental factors were collected, including latitudes, water and air temperatures, oxygen concentration, pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), salinity, and chlorophyll-a concentration. The taxonomic distribution of transcriptionally active taxa within the gill microbiota was quantified by 16S rRNA gene transcripts sequencing. The results showed differential bacterial activity between the different geographical locations, explained by latitude, salinity, and, to a lesser extent, air temperature. Network analysis allowed the detection of a potential dysbiosis signature (i.e., bacterial imbalance) in fish gill microbiota from Duquet Lake in the Hudson Strait and the system Five Mile Inlet connected to the Hudson Bay, both showing the lowest alpha diversity and connectivity between taxa.																			2165-0497					MAR 5	2024	12	3								10.1128/spectrum.02943-23	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.02943-23		FEB 2024						38329329					WOS:001158963200001

The primary objective was to identify hydrologic conditions and other factors that enhance production of phytoplankton biomass in the floodplain waters. Recent reductions in phytoplankton have limited secondary production in the river and estuary, and increased phytoplankton biomass is a restoration objective for this system. Chlorophyll a was used as a measure of phytoplankton biomass in this study. Chlorophyll a concentrations were low (<4 μg l(-1)) during inundation by the river when flow through the floodplain was high, but concentrations rapidly increased as river inflow decreased and the floodplain drained. Therefore, hydrologic conditions in the weeks following inundation by river inflow appeared most important for producing phytoplankton biomass in the floodplain. Discharges from local streams were important sources of water to the floodplain before and after inundation by the river, and they supplied dissolved inorganic nutrients while chlorophyll a was increasing. Discharge from the floodplain was enriched in chlorophyll a relative to downstream locations in the river and estuary during the initial draining and later when local stream inflows produced brief discharge pulses. Based on the observation that phytoplankton biomass peaks during drainage events, we suggest that phytoplankton production in the floodplain and biomass transport to downstream locations would be higher in years with multiple inundation and draining sequences.																			0018-8158					FEB 1	2004	513	1-3					129	139		10.1023/B:hydr.0000018178.85404.1c	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:hydr.0000018178.85404.1c													WOS:000220784200013
J	Justus, B; Meredith, B				Justus, Billy; Meredith, Bradley			Water quality of potential reference lakes in the Arkansas Valley and Ouachita Mountain ecoregions, Arkansas	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												This report describes a study to identify reference lakes in two lake classifications common to parts of two level III ecoregions in western Arkansas-the Arkansas Valley and Ouachita Mountains. Fifty-two lakes were considered. A screening process that relied on land-use data was followed by reconnaissance water-quality sampling, and two lakes from each ecoregion were selected for intensive water-quality sampling. Our data suggest that Spring Lake is a suitable reference lake for the Arkansas Valley and that Hot Springs Lake is a suitable reference lake for the Ouachita Mountains. Concentrations for five nutrient constituents-orthophosphorus, total phosphorus, total kjeldahl nitrogen, total nitrogen, and total organic carbon-were lower at Spring Lake on all nine sampling occasions and transparency measurements at Spring Lake were significantly deeper than measurements at Cove Lake. For the Ouachita Mountains ecoregion, water quality at Hot Springs Lake slightly exceeded that of Lake Winona. The most apparent water-quality differences for the two lakes were related to transparency and total organic carbon concentrations, which were deeper and lower at Hot Springs Lake, respectively. Our results indicate that when nutrient concentrations are low, transparency may be more valuable for differentiating between lake water quality than chemical constituents that have been useful for distinguishing between water-quality conditions in mesotrophic and eutrophic settings. For example, in this oligotrophic setting, concentrations for chlorophyll a can be less than 5 mu g/L and diurnal variability that is typically associated with dissolved oxygen in more productive settings was not evident.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				JUN	2014	186	6					3785	3800		10.1007/s10661-014-3657-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-3657-1								24532342					WOS:000335156600036

We present the results of a multiple year study on a breeding population of Sand Martins along the River Po in Northern Italy through ringing breeding birds at nesting colonies (2002-2014). There was a trend for the abundance of the studied population to fluctuate. Recapture data were analysed to obtain apparent survival probabilities which differed between the sexes, but not between years. No apparent relationship was found between survival and three different meteo-climatic indices (North Atlantic Oscillation, Sahel rainfall and Lake Chad rainfall). During the 1980s and 1990s, winter survival was positively correlated with rainfall in the winter quarters. Although rainfall in the winter quarters has been more stable during the past 15 years, Sand Martin populations are still decreasing. Our findings suggest that the relationship with rainfall no longer holds, and that current population declines may be unrelated to climate in the winter quarters.

Agricultural Best Management Practice Abundance and Location does not Influence Stream Ecosystem Function or Water Quality in the Summer Season	WATER												Best management practices (BMPs) are tools commonly used to mitigate negative impacts of agriculture on water quality; however, the relationship between BMPs and aquatic ecological function is unknown. Our research goal was to determine the association between both stream ecosystem metabolism and water quality, and the abundance and location of four different BMPs in agricultural catchments. Dissolved oxygen was measured over a two-week period in mid-June and used to estimate ecosystem metabolism of 13 headwater streams representing a gradient of BMP implementation in Southern Ontario, Canada. Stepwise regression analyses were used to associate stream metabolism and water quality with metrics describing the abundance and location of BMPs within each catchment. Studied streams exhibited rates of metabolism comparable to catchments from other agricultural regions. However, metrics of BMP implementation were not associated with either stream metabolism or water quality. Our results suggest that BMPs in the studied agricultural catchments are not improving water quality or mitigating water quality impacts on stream metabolism during the summer season. We propose that seasonality of catchment hydrology and time lag effects associated with past agricultural land use may be masking the mitigation benefits of BMPs on stream ecosystem conditions during the summer season.					; Yates, Adam/Y-1532-2019	Yates, Adam Gordon/0000-0002-2239-9046; 													2073-4441					DEC	2015	7	12					6861	6876		10.3390/w7126661	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w7126661													WOS:000367533700012

Snowfall undercatch is often overlooked in temperate regions, but is very significant in cold regions where snow makes up the majority of the precipitation. Evaporation is-often over-estimated in cold regions. The Arctic tundra is sometimes referred to as a desert because of the very low annual precipitation. However, the abundance of lakes proves that the area has a large excess of water resulting in relatively low evapotranspiration and high annual runoff coefficients. Snow accumulation can also be deceiving. Large bare areas in winter mask the storage of large quantities of snow in depressions and on the lee side of hills. The absence of runoff and stream flow during most of the year and the small size of streams are not indicative of minimal water yield since much of the flow occurs during melt conditions in spring. The lack of data and incomplete understanding of cold region hydrology suggest the need for an explicit technique to handle uncertainty.

J	Holopainen, IJ; Tonn, WM; Paszkowski, CA				Holopainen, IJ; Tonn, WM; Paszkowski, CA			Tales of two fish: The dichotomous biology of crucian carp (Carassius carassius (L)) in northern Europe	ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI												Crucian carp, a common Eurasian cyprinid fish, shows striking dichotomies in several aspects of its physiology and ecology, at both the individual and population levels. These dichotomies consistently reflect the communities and ecosystems in which they occur, contrasting crucian carp that occur in ''monocultures'' (single-species fish assemblages) in ponds with those occurring in multi-species assemblages, primarily in lakes. Dichotomies also occur in the physiological state of individuals between summer and winter. All these dichotomies, involving differences in morphology and population structure, population dynamics and life history, reflect in an integrative way the adaptive strengths and limitations of a unique species. In numerous northern ponds, dense monocultures of crucian carp an sealed in by thick ice and snow to live more than six months in dark, anoxic waters at near freezing temperatures. In summer, these populations experience temperatures of up to 30 degrees C during a relatively brief period of vigorous growth and repeated bouts of reproduction in almost continuous daylight. Crucians in lakes experience a more benign abiotic environment and, with densities that can be orders of magnitude lower than those in ponds, are likely unaffected by intraspecific interactions. However, co-occurring species present a challenging biotic environment. Crucian carp is exceptionally vulnerable to predation and populations persist via three kinds of refugia. Aided by extreme physiological adaptations, crucian carp can be the sole piscine inhabitant of seasonally harsh but productive small ponds, the refugium habitat, where they form dense monocultures of stunted individuals. The structural complexity offered by dense beds of macrophytes in productive larger lakes, the other common habitat (habitat refugium) of crucian carp, ensures survival of a few offspring, even in the presence of piscivores. The risk of predation still remains high for crucians until a certain length (and/or body depth), the size refugium, is attained. Crucian carp's unique anoxia tolerance, accompanied by many exceptional structural and functional features, and the species' suitability for laboratory studies, has recently raised crucian carp to a status of a physiological model species like its relative, the goldfish. Moreover, the dichotomy found in the structure of natural populations has made crucian carp an attractive model for ecological studies in competition and predation. Crucian carp's resistance to adverse environmental conditions further suggests promising economical use in aquaculture to produce hybrids endowed with higher survival capacity than common carp.

The model has been calibrated using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation method. The model results show, among others, that the largest change in water temperature in a projected future climate occurs in April-May when a 4.6-7.6 degrees C increase in epilimnion and 2.7-4.4 degrees C increase in whole-lake monthly mean temperature occurs compared to the climate of 1961-1990. This corresponds to a large decrease in the probability of ice cover in March - April. In winter and early spring a negative correlation was obtained between lake water and air temperatures in a projected future climate due to the thermal buffering feature of the lake ice and snow cover. The uncertainties connected to the choice of the general circulation model and the boundary condition forcing for the regional atmospheric climate model were often significantly larger than the uncertainties connected to MyLake model parameter values.

Over the past two decades, phenological mismatch - the temporal misalignment between animals' peak nutrient demand and optimal resource availability - has emerged as a significant conservation challenge. This issue is particularly worrisome for migratory birds, which must accumulate energy reserves to meet the elevated metabolic demands of migration between breeding and wintering grounds. In Poyang Lake, a crucial wintering ground along the East Asian-Australasian flyway, increasing asynchrony between vegetation growth and the migration of herbivorous waterbirds significantly impedes conservation efforts and presents a major management challenge for this Ramsar wetland. This study evaluates the efficacy of mowing, a grassland management measure, in regulating plant growth processes and restoring food resources for geese. In-situ mowing experiments were conducted with varying timings in Carex wet meadows, the primary foraging habitats of geese. Optimal mowing times were identified, and the maximum goose carrying capacity was assessed by comparing Carex growth and nutritional dynamics with goose dietary requirements. The results reveal that mowing effectively slows down the aging process of Carex, and protein content is identified as a critical limiting factor for geese foraging. Different mowing timings extend the suitable foraging period by 11-25 days. Estimates suggest varying carrying capacities with different mowing timings, supporting goose populations ranging from 133 to 2,046 in Changhuchi Lake during wintering. The optimal mowing window is early October, avoiding dates before late September and after late November. Moreover, multiple-stage mowing is recommended to accommodate different wintering stages. The study highlights mowing as a potential habitat restoration approach for goose conservation, effectively mitigating the challenges imposed by phenological mismatch directly and indirectly caused by anthropogenic activities.					; Yu, Xiubo/A-5875-2016	WEN, LI/0000-0003-3783-3826; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				NOV	2024	370								122360	10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.122360	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.122360		SEP 2024						39243644					WOS:001311814600001

Precipitation/moisture variations between the northeastern and southeastern Tibetan Plateau show an out-of-phase pattern on decadal, centennial, and millennial time scales during the Holocene, influenced by interactions between the summer monsoon system and the westerlies. However, conflicting proxies exist in some regions on millennial time scale, and it is vital to detect and evaluate the detailed processes responsible for such a dipolar pattern. Here, we select and summarize well-dated Holocene records of pollen-based vegetation, oxygen isotope composition (518O) of authigenic carbonates and cellulose, hydrogen isotope composition (5D) of long-chain n-alkanes from leaf wax, and chronology of aeolian activity and soil development from various geological archives, including lake sediments, peat bogs, aeolian deposits, cave speleothems, and tree rings from the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. We find a longterm decreasing trend in summer monsoon precipitation across the eastern Tibetan Plateau during the Holocene, indicated by declining arboreal pollen percentages, enhanced values of 518O from lakes in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SETP), speleothems, and tree-ring cellulose, as well as enhanced 5D values across the entire eastern margin of the plateau. A summary of the chronology of aeolian sand and paleosol on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (NETP) reveals enhanced aeolian activity during the early Holocene and increased soil development from the middle Holocene onwards. These data, combined with those indicating increased lake levels and decreased lake-water 518O values in the region, suggest that the effective moisture on the NETP increased throughout the Holocene. Our findings indicate that increased non-monsoon-season precipitation with the strengthening intensity of the westerlies, against a background of possible decreasing summer evaporation, provided increased moisture to the NETP, ultimately resulting in a Holocene dipolar pattern of humidity variations between the northern and southern parts of the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. The inference that the seasonality of precipitation controlled moisture variation in the study region is supported by high-resolution climate proxies and meteorological data on centennial and decadal time scales during the last millennium. Additionally, we propose a conceptual framework of hydroclimatic processes in a land-lake system to reconcile contradictions between different indicators. The present study not only clearly summarizes the Holocene climate change on the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, but it also highlights the critical importance of distinguishing terrestrial and lacustrine signals in paleolimnological studies, and of noting associated differences that may potentially result from proxy sensitivity to seasonal climate changes.

Initially, a mathematical model is developed in the Engineering Equation Solver (EES) for the heat pump system and the submerged coils in a lake. System performance is determined for the submerged slinky copper coils under the various operating conditions. Afterwards, parametric analysis is performed considering different influencing parameters, such as the lake water temperature, ambient temperature, and mass flow rate of the circulating fluid at constant lake depth of 4 ft. The experimental setup is developed for 3.51 kW cooling capacity after cooling load calculation for a small room. In the current study, slinky copper coils are used to exchange heat with lake water. The experimental setup is installed in Taxila, Pakistan, and the system's performance is analyzed during selected days. After experimentation based on hourly and daily operation characteristics, it is observed that the lake water temperature has significant influence on the heat transfer rate between slinky coil and lake water. While the lake water temperature in summer decreases and increases in winter with the depth. The resulted daily average coefficient of performance (COP) of the system is within the range of 3.24-3.46 during the selected days of cooling season. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the LWHP systems can be considered a viable solution for Pakistan having a well-established canal system.					; Mustafa, Azeem/IWM-0744-2023; Abbas, Muhammad Mujtaba/C-6101-2019; Shahzad, Muhammad Kashif/AAB-9877-2022	Shahzad, Muhammad Kashif/0000-0002-4801-3519; Ali, Muzaffar/0000-0003-4276-5215; Mustafa, Azeem/0000-0002-2950-0530; 														2227-9717				SEP	2019	7	9							553	10.3390/pr7090553	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr7090553													WOS:000489121800006

This change in the vegetative cover affected use of these plots by several other rodent species and by foraging birds. The mechanism producing this change probably involves a combination of decreased soil disturbance and reduced predation on large-sized seeds when kangaroo rats are absent. Species diversity of summer annual dicots was greater on plots where kangaroo rats were present, as predicted by keystone predator models. However, it is not clear whether this was caused directly by activities of the kangaroo rats or indirectly as a consequence of the increase in grass cover. No experimental effect on species diversity of winter annual dicots was detected. Our study site was located in a natural transition between desert scrub and grassland, where abiotic conditions and the effects of organisms may be particularly influential in determining the structure and composition of vegetation Under these conditions kangaroo rats have a dramatic effect on plant cover and species composition.

Chara growth was found to be seasonal, with maximum growth occurring from late April to July During this period, pH rose to > 10 while the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and calcium fell as a result of photosynthesis and calcification. Large gradients in pH, water temperature and irradiance were found within the Chara sward and measurements showed that most growth and photosynthesis occurred within the upper 20 cm of the water column. Chara oospore formation was also found to be seasonal but dependent upon environmental conditions. delta O-18(w), rose rapidly during summer as evaporation progressed and this was correlated with the delta O-18(DIC), and to some extent with delta O-18(c), of the Chara encrusted calcite. However, extreme isotopic disequilibrium was observed between the delta O-18(c) and the delta O-18(w) and also between the delta C-13(c) and the delta C-13(DIC). This arose from the high pH allowing atmospheric CO2 to enter the water and combine directly with OH-. It is concluded that, within shallow eutrophic lakes containing Chara swards, inferences of climate (e.g. air temperature) cannot be made from observations of the isotopic composition of Chara carbonates. However in combination with other geochemical data, disequilibrium events may be identifiable in ancient lake basins and taken as evidence for lake shallowing and/or eutrophication.

Pelagic-benthic coupling: deep benthic zone response to winter diatom bloom sinking in oligotrophic Lake Alchichica, Puebla, Mexico	HIDROBIOLOGICA												The aim of this study is to recognize the existence of a pelagic-benthic coupling in the oligotrophic, tropical Lake Alchichica through analysis of the response of the deep benthic zone to the winter diatom bloom deposition. The water column phytoplankton biomass and the sedimentary chlorophyll a were analyzed along an annual cycle. Alchichica is a warm monomictic lake circulating in winter and stratified over the rest of the year. The presence of turbulence and nutrient availability during the mixing period, favor the development of a diatom bloom composed by large species (e. g., Cyclotella atchichicana) which are nottotally consumed and settle down. The deep benthic zone responds to the sinking of the winter diatom bloom with the prompt development -and permanence for an extended period- of hypolimnetic anoxia, which in turns prevents the establishment and development of the benthic fauna in Lake Alchichica, and favors the internal loss of nitrogen through denitrification, and accordingly, promotes nitrogen to be the limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth.

MINOR CONSTITUENTS BY OPTICAL EMISSION-SPECTROSCOPY	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												A hydrogeochemical study to determine the abundance of the chemical elements in the water of Linsley Pond [USA] was initiated in 1965. This particular aspect of the investigation involved the elements which could be detected by optical emission spectroscopy. These were Li, Ag, Be, Hg, B, Sn, Bi, V, Mo and Co. A study of the vertical distribution of these elements showed that during the autumnal homothermal period only Sn and V did not show maxima in the deepest waters. During the period of ice cover all elements except Co and Mo exhibited peaks in the deep hypolimnion. At this time V was more concentrated in the ice than in the surface water beneath. All 10 elements exhibited maxima in the lower waters at the time of spring turnover. Bi, Sn, V and Li showed no consistent rise in concentration in the deep hypolimnion during the period of summer stagnation. The minor element composition of the density current which occurred beneath the ice, the effect of vegetative growth and decay on their distribution in the lake, and their distribution within a few plants living in and near the inlet are presented.																			0003-9136						1976	78	3					279	309																WOS:A1976CK83000001

Influence of environmental conditions on late-summer cyanobacterial abundance in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT					8th Conference on the State of Lake Huron: Ecosystem Change, Habitat and Management	2007	Honey Harbour, CANADA	Aquat Ecosyst Hlth & Management Soc, Lake Huron Binatl Partnership				The relationships among environmental conditions and phytoplankton assemblages were characterized during late summer (2003-2005) in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron. Differences among sampling stations, arising primarily from spatial disparities in water-column optical properties and nutrient availability, were evident. Cyanobacteria and diatoms dominated phytoplankton assemblages, with the greatest total chlorophyll a concentrations occurring at the innermost portions of the Bay. Microcystis abundance was greatest in the Bay's upper reaches and decreased with increasing distance from the mouth of the Saginaw River. A suite of variables, indicative of annually-distinct meteorological and hydrological conditions and phosphorus-laden inflows, were identified to (collectively) best 'group' stations in a manner consistent with that of phylogenetic-group chlorophyll a concentrations and cyanobacterial biovolumes. However, a great deal of variability between abiotic and biotic patterns remained unexplained and several abiotic variables singularly corresponded with Microcystis abundance. Taken together, it appears that multiple environmental conditions (including annual/episodic meteorological patterns, seasonal/intermittent riverine inflows, annual phosphorus loading, etc.) interact with taxon-specific physiological traits to holistically influence late-summer phytoplankton abundance throughout inner Saginaw Bay.

This flood pulse and its long-term dynamics under the Mekong River basin's (MRB) fast socio-economic development and climate change need to be identified and understood. However, existing studies fall short of sufficient time coverage or concentrate only on changes in water level (WL) that is only one of the critical flood pulse parameters influencing the flood pulse ecosystem productivity. Considering the rapidly changing hydroclimatic conditions in the Mekong basin, it is crucial to systematically analyse the changes in multiple key flood pulse parameters. Here, we aim to do that by using observed WL data for 1960-2019 accompanied with several parameters derived from a Digital Bathymetry Model. Results show significant declines of WL and inundation area from the late 1990s in the dry season and for the whole year, on top of increased subdecadal variability. Decreasing (increasing) probabilities of high (low) inundation area for 2000-2019 have been found, in comparison to the return period of inundation area for 1986-2000 (1960-1986). The mean seasonal cycle of daily WL in dry (wet) season for 2000-2019, compared to that for 1986-2000, has shifted by 10 (5) days. Significant correlations and coherence changes between the WL and large-scale circulations (i.e., El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)), indicate that the atmospheric circulations could have influenced the flood pulse in different time scales. Also, the changes in discharge at the Mekong mainstream suggest that anthropogenic drivers may have impacted the high water levels in the lake. Overall, our results indicate a declining flood pulse since the late 1990s.					; Liu, Junguo/B-3021-2012; Kummu, Matti/C-4797-2011; Varis, Olli/G-6506-2011; Chen, Aifang/AAG-6613-2019; Chen, Deliang/A-5107-2013; Wang, Jie/NPI-6740-2025; Tang, Qiuhong/AAD-9832-2022	Chen, Aifang/0000-0002-3237-3122; Liu, Junguo/0000-0002-5745-6311; Varis, Olli/0000-0001-9231-4549; Wang, Jie/0000-0003-2520-2920; Kummu, Matti/0000-0001-5096-0163; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				SEP	2021	35	9							e14327	10.1002/hyp.14327	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14327													WOS:000700789300021

However, it is unclear which factor has been most important. In this study, we analyzed leaf wax delta C-13 and delta D and glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) in sediments from Lake Kushu, Rebun Island, northern Japan, and discuss changes in climate over the past 17,000 years. The GDGT-based temperature, the averaged chain length, delta C-13 and delta D of long-chain n-fatty acids indicated that the climate was cold during the Oldest Dryas period similar to 16 ka and warm in the early Middle Holocene from similar to 9 to 6 ka. This climate change is consistent with the sea surface temperature in the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition, but inconsistent with changes in the TWC in the Sea of Japan. The results imply that the summer climate of northern Japan was controlled mainly by changes in the development of the North Pacific High via changes in the position of the westerly jet and East Asian summer monsoon rainfall, whereas the influence of the TWC was limited over a millennial timescale.					; Yonenobu, Hitoshi/AAB-1500-2021; Tarasov, Pavel/ABG-3993-2020; Suzuki, Kenta/ABC-2336-2021; IRINO, Tomohisa/D-9282-2018; Chen, Xuanyu/AAG-1549-2019; Yamamoto, Masanobu/A-6990-2012	Suzuki, Kenta/0000-0001-6391-7471; CHEN, XUANYU/0000-0001-6226-9492; 														2296-6463				JUN 14	2021	9								704332	10.3389/feart.2021.704332	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2021.704332													WOS:000667052100001

Featuring the largest high-elevation inland lake zone in the world, comprehensive and comparative studies on the evolution of lake stratification and mixing and their driving forces are still quite limited. Here, using valuable temperature chain measurements in four large lakes (Nam Co, Dagze Co, Bangong Co, and Paiku Co) and a "small lake" adjacent to Nam Co, our objectives are to investigate the seasonal and diurnal variations of epilimnion depth (E-p, the most important layer in stratification and mixing process) and to analyze the driving force differences between "small lake" and Nam Co. Results indicate that E-p estimated by the methods of the absolute density difference (<0.1 kg m(-3)) from the surface and the Lake-Analyzer were quite similar, with the former being more reliable and widely applicable. The stratification and mixing in the four large lakes showed a dimictic pattern, with obvious spring and autumn turnovers. Additionally, the stratification form during heat storage periods, with E-p quickly locating at depths of approximately 10-15 m, and, after that, increasing gradually to the lake bottom. Additionally, the diurnal variation in E-p can be evidenced both in the large and small lakes when temperature measurements above 3 m depth are included. For Nam Co, the dominant influencing factors for the seasonal variation of E-p were the heat budget components (turbulent heat fluxes and radiation components), while wind speed only had a relatively weak positive correlation (r = 0.23). In the "small lake", radiation components and wind speed show high negative (r = -0.43 to -0.59) and positive (r = 0.46) correlation, with rare correlations for turbulent heat flux. These reported characteristics have significance for lake process modeling and evaluation in these high-elevation lakes.					; Ma, Yaoming/AAA-3248-2021; Wang, Lu/R-5075-2016; Ma, Weiqiang/AFK-3927-2022; Wang, Binbin/GPX-5567-2022	Su, Zhongbo/0000-0003-2096-1733; Wang, Yan/0000-0002-0663-1298; Ma, Weiqiang/0000-0003-4334-8042; La, Zhu/0000-0001-5110-9901; 														2073-4441				MAY 31	2023	15	11							2094	10.3390/w15112094	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15112094													WOS:001006417900001

Seats from foxes with dens inside the goose colony contained eggs more frequently than those of foxes that depended more on small mammals outside the colony. Foxes were opportunistic in their feeding habits, as prey use was linked to the nesting cycle of geese, coinciding to periods of egg, goose, and gosling abundance. However, diets in spring, i.e., before geese arrive, reflected the importance to arctic foxes of caching geese and eggs from the previous summer at Karrak Lake. We suggest that large increases in nesting populations of lesser snow and Ross's geese may have beneficial implications for arctic fox populations over a large area.

MODELLING SURFACE-AIR-TEMPERATURE VARIATION OVER COMPLEX TERRAIN AROUND ABISKO, SWEDISH LAPLAND: UNCERTAINTIES OF MEASUREMENTS AND MODELS AT DIFFERENT SCALES	GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												P>Many ecological, physical and geographical processes affected by climate in the natural environment are scale-dependent: determining surface-air-temperature distribution at a scale of tens to hundreds of metres can facilitate such research, which is currently hampered by the relative dearth of meteorological stations and complex surface temperature characteristics, particularly in mountain areas. Here we discuss both the couplings and mismatch of present climatological data at different scales, ranging from similar to 50 m to 100 km, and provide a novel model of the surface-air-temperature distribution in topographically heterogeneous regions. First, a comparison of the large-scale weather station measurements and gridded climate reanalysis (ERA-40) data is used to define regional climatology in the Swedish sub-Arctic and obtain the mesoscale temperature lapse rates. Second, combined with temperature measurements obtained from transects set among complex terrain, key microclimatic characteristics of the temperature distribution are identified, showing few temperature inversions when the wind speed exceeds 3 m s-1, while temperature inversions prevail during calm nights. Besides wind, there is a pronounced winter temperature stratification around the large Lake Tornetrask, and variations in topography are found to have a strong influence in shaping the microscale temperature pattern through their effect on solar radiation during summer. A monthly 50-m scale temperature-distribution (topoclimate) model is built based on the above findings, and model validation is conducted using further fieldwork measurements from different seasons. We present results of surface-air-temperature distribution for the Abisko region, and discuss how these results help reconcile the scale mismatch mentioned above.

Spatial and temporal patterns of microcrustacean assemblage structure and secondary production in a wetland ecosystem	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. In contrast to extensive studies of zooplankton in lakes, the role of microcrustaceans in wetlands is not well studied. In this study, spatial and temporal patterns of microcrustacean assemblage structure and secondary production were quantified over a 2-year period in a southeastern U.S.A. wetland. 2. Thirty-two species, including 19 cladocerans, 10 copepods and three ostracods, generated different temporal patterns of density and production between vegetated (Nymphaea) and non-vegetated (open-water) zones reflecting species-specific differences in life histories. 3. Summer assemblages were dominated by small, planktonic filter-feeders, typified by high annual production/biomass (P/B) and daily production. In contrast, winter assemblages were dominated by larger, epibenthic detritivores with low P/B and high biomass. Seasonal shifts in the relative importance of planktonic species in the warmer months to benthic and epiphytic species in the cooler months suggest that energy flow pathways through microcrustaceans may vary seasonally. 4. Total annual production was higher during both years in the Nymphaea zone (13.0 g and 13.6 g DM m(-2) year(-1)) than the open-water (8.2 and 6.3 g DM m(-2) year(-1)), and was similar between years for the entire wetland pond (12.3 and 12.2 g DM m(-2) year(-1)). 5. Although wetland ecosystems have been the subject of considerable ecological research in the past 20 years, our study is one of the few to demonstrate a highly diverse and relatively productive microcrustacean assemblage. Such comprehensive production studies can be used to quantify the ecological importance of microcrustaceans in freshwater wetland ecosystems.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JUL	2009	54	7					1406	1426		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02193.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02193.x													WOS:000266637400003

The macroinvertebrate benthic community of a shallow Mediterranean lake (Lake Pamvotis, NW Greece) was studied. The benthic assemblage was sampled monthly at five sites during a period of I year (Apr. 1998-Mar. 1999). In addition hypolimnetic water quality variables were monitored over the same period at each site. The aim of the study was (a) to describe the intra-annual and spatial variability in benthic communities, (b) to relate possible community changes to environmental conditions and (c) to evaluate the responses of the lake's ecological status on community indices. The benthic fauna of Lake Pamvotis was found to be very limited with a total of 10 species belonging to five taxonomic groups. The oligochaete community comprised 80% of the total benthic fauna with Potaniothrix bavaricus as a new record for the Lake Pamvotis and Potamothrix hammoniensis, being the dominant benthic species represented more than 61% of the total benthic fauna. Chironomus plumosus was the most abundant chironomid species contributing with about 6% of the total benthic fauna, and Chaoborus flavicans with 19% was the important dipteran. Almost all benthic species showed the same intra-annual seasonal pattern, with peak population densities during spring and early summer except P. hammoniensis which predominated during the whole sampling period. Dissolved oxygen and temperature seemed to be the main environmental factors affecting community indices. Benthic communities are affected by human disturbances in Lake Pamvotis shifting their composition to more tolerant taxa, reflecting also the eutrophic to hypertophic character of the lake.

Polymictic pool behaviour in a montane meadow, Sierra Nevada, CA	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												We observed polymictic behaviour in stream pools in Long Meadow, Sequoia National Park, Californiapart of the Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory. Stream pools stratified thermally during the day time and were isothermal at nightthis pattern persists from the middle of summer into the fall. We found that four characteristics typical of a mountain meadow environmentlow stream flow, open sky, cold groundwater discharge, and elevated organic carbon concentrationsare particularly conducive to pool stratification. Incoming shortwave radiation was the dominant energy input to heat pool water while nighttime emitted longwave radiation was the major cooling mechanism. Relatively cold groundwater discharge into the pool bottom increased density stratification within the pool. Elevated DOC concentrations increased the capacity of the pool to absorb photosynthetically active radiation and also promoted stratification. Stream velocities in the meadow were generally insufficient to meet threshold Richardson numbers and mix the pools during the daytime; smaller stream cross sectional areas would have potential for destabilizing pools in the daytime. We propose a conceptual model for describing polymictic stream pools and assessing the potential for polymictic pools to occur. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Gao, KL; Duan, AM; Chen, DL				Gao, Kailun; Duan, Anmin; Chen, Deliang			Interdecadal summer warming of the Tibetan Plateau potentially regulated by a sea surface temperature anomaly in the Labrador Sea	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Downward clear-sky longwave radiation, which is related to atmospheric water vapour content, has been suggested as an important factor causing an interdecadal increase in boreal summer surface temperature over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). We reveal the relationship between the 2 m air temperature (t2m) and water vapour over the TP in boreal summer, as well as the mechanism modulating the change in atmospheric water vapour. In recent decades, spatiotemporal variations between water vapour and t2m in boreal summer over the TP have shown synchronicity at the decadal scale. Moreover, Rossby wave trains which originate over the Northwest Atlantic and trigger an anomalous anticyclone between the northeastern TP and Baikal Lake are suggested to play a crucial role in decadal warming over the TP. First, the anomalous anticyclone, with an equivalent barotropic structure, can directly heat near-surface air across the northeastern TP. Second, it promotes net water vapour input into the northeastern TP, leading to an increase of the total water vapour content over the entire TP, ultimately contributing to warming. Finally, a linear baroclinic model experiment further indicates that the Rossby wave trains are mainly associated with interdecadal increases in sea surface temperature (SST) in the Labrador Sea, with the SST in Baffin Bay playing a secondary role.

From observed data from 123 stations for the period 1962-2012, the characteristics of cold-season (November-February) SEP in this area were analyzed. Results showed that SEP occurred throughout the late autumn and winter. In all, 1173 SEP days were identified during the 51 years, of which snow days accounted for 73.7% and rain and snow-rain days accounted for 16.1% and 10.1%, respectively. December had the largest number of SEP snow days, followed by January and November. November was the most productive month in terms of SEP rain and snow-rain days. Intense SEP snowfall mainly affected the inland hill area of the peninsula, whereas light SEP snowfall reached farther inland. SEP rainfall shared a similar pattern with snowfall. The SEP frequency showed a significant interannual variability and a nonsignificant upward trend over the period analyzed. SEP was most likely to occur when the temperature difference between sea surface and 850 hPa over the Bohai Sea was above 10 degrees C, indicating a dominant influence of low-level cold-air advection over the sea on the generation and development of the weather phenomenon. A significant negative correlation was also found between the area of sea ice in the Bohai Sea and intense SEP snowfall, indicating that sea ice extent had an important effect on SEP variability over the peninsula. In the case of extremely intense SEP events, a deeper East Asian trough at the 500-hPa level developed over the southwest of the study area and temperature and geopotential height contours were orthogonal to each other, indicating strong geostrophic cold-air advection over the Bohai Sea and the Shandong Peninsula. The extremely intense SEP events were also characterized by anomalous low temperature and high relative humidity in the lower troposphere, which contributed to greater gravitational instability in the study area.					; Ren, Guoyu/J-9953-2012	Ren, Guoyu/0000-0002-9351-4179; 													1558-8424	1558-8432				JUN	2018	57	6					1291	1308		10.1175/JAMC-D-17-0200.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-17-0200.1													WOS:000437091300004

J.; Begin, Yves; Nicault, Antoine			Spring flood reconstruction from continuous and discrete tree ring series	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												This study proposes a method to reconstruct past spring flood discharge from continuous and discrete tree ring chronologies, since both have their respective strengths and weaknesses in northern environments. Ring width or density series provide uninterrupted records that are indirectly linked to regional discharge through a concomitant effect of climate on tree growth and streamflow. Conversely, discrete event chronologies constitute conspicuous records of past high water levels since they are constructed from trees that are directly damaged by the flood. However, the uncertainty of discrete series increases toward the past, and their relationships with spring discharge are often nonlinear. To take advantage of these two sources of information, we introduce a new transfer model technique on the basis of generalized additive model (GAM) theory. The incorporation of discrete predictors and the evaluation of the robustness of the nonlinear relationships are assessed using a jackknife procedure. We exemplify our approach in a reconstruction of May water supplies to the Caniapiscau hydroelectric reservoir in northern Quebec, Canada. We used earlywood density measurements as continuous variables and ice-scar dates around Lake Montausier in the James Bay area as a discrete variable. Strong calibration (0.57 < 0.61 < 0.75) and validation (0.27 < 0.44 < 0.58) R(2) statistics were obtained, thus highlighting the usefulness of the model. Our reconstruction suggests that, since similar to 1965, spring floods have become more intense and variable in comparison with the last 150 years. We argue that a similar procedure can be used in each case where discrete and continuous tree ring proxies are used together to reconstruct past spring floods.																			0043-1397					JUL 9	2011	47								W07516	10.1029/2010WR010131	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2010WR010131													WOS:000292612400002
J	Demiryürek, M				Demiryurek, Mehmet			A Research on the Sheiks of Hala Sultan Tekke in Cyprus (1570-1878)	BELLETEN												The tomb of Umm Haram bint Milhan, a lady of the kin of Mohammad, is in Larnaca, near the Salt Lake. Generally, it is considered that she took part in the first military expedition of Cyprus by the Muslim and in the spring of A.D. 649 left Syria with her husband Ubada ibn as-Samit, for the conquest of Cyprus. When the army landed in Cyprus she died by a fall from her mule on the spot where she is buried. Having conquered Cyprus, the Ottomans attached importance to her tomb and some properties were allocated for her tomb as vaqfs and Turbeddars were appointed to protect her tomb. Even though the aforementioned tomb has not been known exactly whether it was built before the Ottomans, it is understood that the tomb and its protectors (turbedars) were existing in the first years of the 17th century and onwards. Although the tomb was important for the Turkish Cypriots called her "Hala Sultan Tekke" and nominated turbedars, it has not been made a comprehensive research to reveal its Turbedars under the Ottoman Rule (1570-1878). Therefore, the aim of this study is to unearth its Turbedars or Seyhs and make a contribution its history during the period under question.

This study analysed environmental features, macroinvertebrate assemblages (MIB) and functional feeding groups in outlet, inlet and tributary streams (i.e. streams other than the main stem) of a stream-lake network in Chilean Andean lakes, to verify if lake outlets reflect an ecotone condition. Permutational analysis of variance and canonical analysis of principal coordinates based on environmental features and MIB revealed a significant difference between stream types. Higher taxa richness was found in tributaries, whereas population densities, equitability and diversity indices varied between stream types. Eighty-five taxa were identified, with 7% of taxa found exclusively in outlets, 5% in inlets, and 22% in tributaries. Collector-gatherers were dominant in all stream types and there was no statistical differences among feeding groups and stream types. The distance-based linear model identified water temperature, % rock, % sand, and % FPOM coverage as having significant influence on richness and density of MIB in summer, while water temperature and %FPOM coverage were significant in spring. Our results suggest that lake outlets house MIB different than lake inlets and tributaries, as well as environmental variables, supporting the idea that Andean lake outlets reflect an ecotone condition.					; Valdovinos, Claudio/AAQ-1625-2020	Salvo, Jacqueline/0009-0009-5805-7628; Fierro, Pablo/0000-0001-9996-2821; Valdovinos, Claudio/0000-0002-9126-3978													0028-8330	1175-8805				APR 3	2021	55	2					375	392		10.1080/00288330.2020.1784239	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.2020.1784239		JUL 2020											WOS:000547421800001

Lake Chapala, the largest freshwater body in Mexico, has experienced persistent turbidity and sediment influx since the 1970s, primarily due to upstream erosion and reduced water inflow. In this study, we utilized Landsat satellite imagery in conjunction with near-synchronous in situ reflectance measurements to monitor spatial and seasonal turbidity patterns between 2023 and 2025. The surface reflectance was radiometrically corrected and validated using spectroradiometer data collected across eight sampling sites in the eastern sector of the lake, the area where the highest rates of horizontal change in turbidity occur. Based on the relationship between near-infrared reflectance and field turbidity, second-order polynomial models were developed for spring, fall, and the composite annual model. The annual model demonstrated acceptable performance (R2 = 0.72), effectively capturing the spatial variability and temporal dynamics of the average annual turbidity for the whole lake. Historical turbidity data (2000-2018) and a particular case study in 2016 were used as a reference for statistical validation, confirming the model's applicability under varying hydrological conditions. Our findings underscore the utility of empirical remote-sensing models, supported by field validation, for cost-effective and scalable turbidity monitoring in dynamic tropical lakes with limited monitoring infrastructure.

The effect of temperature on the coupling between phosphorus and growth in lacustrine bacterioplankton communities	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Phosphorus (P) routinely limits microbial growth in freshwater ecosystems. The growth rate hypothesis (GRH) relates growth to biomass P content mechanistically through changes in ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA). Although the GRH has been shown in cultured bacteria, less well understood is how GRH relationships are affected by interactions with environmental parameters such as temperature. To address this, we evaluated the relationship between bacterial biomass P, RNA: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ratio, and growth rate in 47 northern temperate lakes. Although RNA: DNA ratio was positively correlated with bacterial biomass P : carbon (C), we found no correlation between growth rate and RNA: DNA or between growth rate and biomass P : C. There was, however, a significant effect of temperature on biomass P : C. We investigated the effect of temperature more directly using filter-separated bacterial communities from two lakes during two seasons while experimentally manipulating temperature and resources. For the summer communities, bacterial production (BP) and biomass P were positively correlated, and the slope of that relationship increased with increasing temperature. In winter communities, BP and biomass P were again positively correlated; however, the slope of that relationship decreased with increasing temperature. The slope of the relationship between BP and biomass P is a metric of nutrient use efficiency and was strongly influenced by temperature. More importantly, bacterioplankton demonstrated seasonal acclimation or adaptation to in situ temperature, suggesting that studies evaluating multiple communities in time and space fail to find a clear relationship between temperature and bacterial metabolism because bacterial communities are locally adapted to in situ temperature.

The plant remains could have become carbonised during food preparation, or when fuel included seeds. Rich and diverse floras were retrieved from 40 soil samples, in all 534 seeds, grains, spikelets, culm fragments and leaflet fragments which were attributed to 30 taxa in the flora of Egypt, Wild grasses from almost all samples represent 83% of the plant remains. Quantitative correlation between plant remains and archaeological contexts is discussed. The highest density of plant remains was recorded from pot-holes (in which pots were stood), while sediments recovered near querns show the lowest. The economy of the site was apparently based mainly on herding associated with the gathering of grasses which suggests that the climate at Farafra during the middle Holocene (6077-4511 cal B.C.) was wetter than today's, with winter and summer rainfall. A reconstruction of the vegetation around the site comprises reed plant cover, aquatic and wetland plants and desert savanna.																			0939-6314	1617-6278				DEC	2001	10	4					235	246		10.1007/PL00006935	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/PL00006935													WOS:000174351400006

Gradually, however, eutrophication and climate warming significantly changed the lake environment. From the 1970s to the 2010s, total phosphorus and chlorophyll a levels increased two- and threefold, respectively, while the average June-September surface temperature increased by 0.34 degrees C decade'. The highest population biomass of the young-of-the-year vendace in autumn, 6-18 (mean = 14) kg ha(-1). was recorded in 1973-1989, a period of sustainable fishery. Overfishing in 1990-1999 reduced autumn biomass of young-of-the-year vendace biomass to 3-11 (mean = 6) kg ha(-1), allowing the competing planktivores perch (Percafluviatills), roach (Rutilus rutilus), and smelt (Osmerus - eperlanus) to increase and consume a larger part of the plankton resources. Eutrophication and climate warming appear to have favoured these species, and the new resource division persisted even after the vendace population recovered.

The slow recovery is attributed to the reoxidation and release of stored sulphur in catchments. Reduced sulphur retained in previous years when sulphur deposition was higher is exposed to air and oxidized during severe droughts, then exported during subsequent wet periods Elevated stream SO42- concentrations and export rates occur in the autumns of years with prolonged severe droughts, particularly in catchments with extensive wetlands. Drought in our study catchments occurred in years following strong El Nino events. When the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) was strongly negative (1976-77, 1982-83, 1986-87, 1991-92, 1993-94) the frequency of occurrence of drought the following summer in small catchments with shallow overburden was extremely high. A lake's rate of recovery from acidification depends upon the amount of excess reduced S that has been stored in anoxic zones in the catchment (largely a function of the extent of wetlands) during years of elevated S deposition rates, and the frequency and severity of droughts. If long-term changes in global or regional climate alter the frequency or magnitude of El Nino-related droughts, the recovery of acidified lakes will be affected.

These lakes are important water reservoirs and sensitive to TP climate changes. They regulate regional water circulations, and further influence local ecosystems. Many lakes in ITP are surrounded by conspicuous paleoshorelines indicating much higher past lake levels. Previous studies found that lakes in the western ITP (west of similar to 86 degrees E) apparently expanded to higher levels than those to the east during the Holocene high lake level stage, however, there is no in-depth study on the reasons for the spatial differences of high lake levels within the ITP. In this study, we first identify Holocene lake level (or lake extent) changes over the ITP by combining published lake level variation data with our reconstruction of Dagze Co lake level variations. We then investigate spatial differences in the magnitude of lake expansions and explore the underlying forces driving these differences using the transient climate evolution of the last 21 ka (TraCE-21ka) and Kiel Climate Model (KCM) simulation results. We find that lakes in the ITP expanded to their highest levels during the early Holocene when the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) greatly intensified. After the mid-Holocene, lake levels fell as a result of the weakening of the ISM. The early Holocene northward shift of the westerly jet and a positive phase of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) resulted in the intensification of southwesterly winds on the southwest TP flank. Concurrently, westerly winds over the TP weakened, causing a differential increase in water vapor transport to the ITP with higher precipitation levels in the southwestern ITP and lower levels to the northeast. These wind-driven differential precipitation levels caused lakes in the southwestern ITP to expand to higher levels than those in the central, northern and northeastern ITP. During the early Holocene, expansion of lakes in the northwestern ITP was enhanced by an increase in glacier melt water besides the increased summer rainfall associated with the intensified ISM.

J	Denison, B				Denison, Brandi			Dancing for Snow: Tourism, Entrepreneurship, and Race in the American West	RELIGION AND AMERICAN CULTURE-A JOURNAL OF INTERPRETATION												Starting in 1960, ski resorts in the American West invited American Indian dancers to perform snow dances to address low snowfall. The first documented snow dance was associated with the 1960 Winter Olympics at Lake Tahoe, and snow dances have occurred throughout the twenty-first century, including a 2012 dance at the Vail Ski Resort. In most instances, ski resorts declare the dance successful when snow falls. These snow dances and the related rain dances are best understood in the context of white tourism to the American West and its settler-colonial legacy. I argue that these weather dances are the products of a dynamic relationship between white-owned businesses and American Indian performers in the arid American West, and they have produced racialized ideas of the "sacred"-specifically, an authentic experience that connects settler-colonists to the natural world, facilitated through American Indian spiritual practices. This connection often increases the profitability of businesses that exploit the natural world but also provides an opportunity to express Indigenous communicative agency. I situate the settler-colonial notion of the sacred alongside Indigenous ritual practice, entrepreneurship, and self-determination, using newspapers and anthropological reports.																			1052-1151	1533-8568				WIN	2024	34	1					34	64		10.1017/rac.2025.2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/rac.2025.2		FEB 2025											WOS:001428892400001

This variability is rarely captured by environmental monitoring but is crucial for accurately assessing the magnitude of lake CO2 emissions. However, it is unknown to what extent temporal variability needs to be captured to understand important drivers of lake carbon cycling such as climate and land management. We used environmental monitoring data of Swedish forest lakes collected in autumn (n = 439) and throughout the whole open water season (n = 22) from a wet and a dry year to assess temporal variability in effects of climate and forestry on CO2 concentrations across lakes. Effects differed depending on the season and year sampled. According to cross-lake comparisons based on autumn data, CO2 concentrations increased with annual mean air temperature (dry year) or catchment forest productivity (wet year) but were not related to colored dissolved organic matter concentrations. In contrast, open water-season averaged CO2 concentrations were similar across temperature and productivity gradients but increased with colored dissolved organic matter. These contradictions resulted from scale mismatches in input data, lead to weak explanatory power (R-2 = 9-32%), and were consistent across published data from 79 temperate, boreal, and arctic lakes. In a global survey of 144 published studies, we identified a trade-off between temporal and spatial coverage of CO2 sampling. This trade-off clearly determines which conclusions are drawn from landscape-scale CO(2 )assessments. Accurate evaluations of the effects of climate and land management require spatially and temporally representative data that can be provided by emerging sensor technologies and forms of collaborative sampling. Plain Language Summary Lakes interact with the atmosphere by exchanging greenhouse gases !in such as carbon dioxide that have implications for the global climate. In order to predict future carbon dioxide exchanges, the effects of climate and land management need to be determined. Here we show that the apparent effects of climate and forestry on carbon dioxide concentrations in temperate, boreal, and arctic lakes are inconsistent and depend on whether lakes are sampled during autumn or throughout the year and whether it was a wet or dry year. To accurately quantify effects, hundreds of lakes would need to be sampled at least six times per year. Published literature suggests that this is unrealistic. This implies a need for new automated measurement technologies and collaborative teamwork to provide representative data and allow accurate predictions of the effects of climate and land management.

J	Elliott, JA; Jones, ID; Page, T				Elliott, J. Alex; Jones, Ian D.; Page, Trevor			The importance of nutrient source in determining the influence of retention time on phytoplankton: an explorative modelling study of a naturally well-flushed lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Two models were used to examine the relationship between hydraulic retention time, nutrient source and total chlorophyll in a shallow lake (Bassenthwaite Lake, UK). The first model was a derivation of the Vollenweider model and the second was the phytoplankton community model, PROTECH. The adapted Vollenweider model produced two different responses to changing the retention time that were phosphorus source dependent. If the phosphorus was totally from a point source, then annual mean chlorophyll steadily declined with increasing flushing rate. However, when a diffuse source was used, the chlorophyll changed little and even increased with short retention times (retention time < 40 days). The PROTECH model produced some similar responses but they were more season dependent. Winter mean chlorophyll always declined with decreasing retention time, regardless of nutrient source, but the summer mean curves were source dependent and similar to those produced by the adapted Vollenweider model. Further simulations with PROTECH using a standardized flow regime provided strong evidence as to the mechanisms behind these responses. Analysis showed that the decline in chlorophyll with decreasing retention time was the prevalent response of the PROTECH simulations due to flushing loss of both nutrients and algae. Furthermore, the curve formed an asymptote at long retention times because other factors (e. g. light) limited growth; retention times >100 days had little effect on chlorophyll. However, with a diffuse phosphorus source and short retention times, an increase in biomass was observed when the nutrient was limiting for growth.

However, the treatment efficiency of surface flow constructed wetlands (SFCWs) in winter is generally low. To enhance the nutrient removal performance of SFCWs in winter, we developed a novel hardy submerged plant-benthic fauna system by adding Chironomus riparius (C. riparius) larvae and planting Potamogeton crispus L. in SFCWs. Compared to a system without C. riparius, the paired system greatly enhanced TN and TP removal with the average removal efficiencies of 54.73% and 94.76%, respectively. Furthermore, the paired system improved NO3--N removal efficiency by 29.51% and reached NH4+-N removal efficiency as high as 86.20% simultaneously. The mass balance analysis indicated that C. riparius larvae enhanced substrate absorption and plant uptake in the CWs. The results of microbial analysis agreed with the nutrient removal performance, showing that C. riparius larvae influence the abundance and community structure of microbes related to N removal. As a whole, this study provides a promising ecological strategy for performance intensification of SFCWs in winter.

In this study, different mineral particles with various chemistries (i.e., hematite, biotite, K-feldspar, quartz, muscovite, aragonite, serpentine, olivine, barite, apatite, and pyrite) were incubated for ten days in two Tengchong hot springs, one alkaline (pH similar to 8.34) with a high temperature (similar to 82.8 degrees C) (Gumingquan, short as GMQ) and one acidic (pH similar to 3.63) with a relatively low temperature (similar to 43.3 degrees C) (Wenguangting, short as WGT), to determine the impacts of minerals on the microbial communities taxonomic and functional diversities. Results showed that the mineral-associated bacterial taxa differed from those of the bulk sediment samples in the two hot springs. The relative abundance of Proteobacteria, Euryarchaeota, and Acidobacteria increased in all minerals, indicating that these microorganisms are apt to colonize on solid surfaces. The alpha-diversity indices of the microbial communities on the mineral surfaces in the WGT were higher than those from the bulk sediment samples (p < 0.05), which may be caused by the stochastically adhering process on the mineral surface during 10-day incubation, different from the microbial community in sediment which has experienced long-term environmental and ecological screening. Chemoheterotrophy increased with minerals incubation, which was high in most cultured minerals (the relative contents were 5.8 - 21.4%). Most notably, the sulfate respiration bacteria (mainly related to Desulfobulbaceae and Syntrophaceae) associated with aragonite in the acidic hot spring significantly differed from other minerals, possibly due to the pH buffering effect of aragonite providing more favorable conditions for their survival and proliferation. By comparison, aragonite cultured in the alkaline hot spring highly enriched denitrifying bacteria and may have promoted the nitrogen cycle within the system. Collectively, we speculated that diverse microbes stochastically adhered on the surface of minerals in the water flows, and the physicochemical properties of minerals drove the enrichment of certain microbial communities and functional groups during the short-term incubation. Taken together, these findings thereby provide novel insights into mechanisms of community assembly and element cycling in the terrestrial hydrothermal system associated with hot springs.

The first sedimentological phase of the record from 6030 to 4200 cal yr BP is characterised by low productivity and high detrital input indicating surface runoff processes due to enhanced rainfall. This interpretation is in agreement with other hydrological reconstructions reporting increased precipitation also in CE Europe, NE Mediterranean and also inferred summer and winter latitudinal temperature gradients (LTG) (as defined by Davis and Brewer, 2009), showing a strong connectivity between basin-lacustrine dynamics and the establishment of the dominant, Atlantic, atmospheric circulation pattern in the area. The lacustrine system was more stable between 4200 and 2500 cal yr BP when clastic inputs diminished and biological productivity increased. During this interval, the coherence of Lake Ighiel's multi century detrital events, identified in a range of proxy-data (albeit different in frequency and magnitude), with flood activity in central Europe (the Alps) suggests a common moisture forcing (Atlantic and periodically Mediterranean influences). In contrast, different reconstructions from the NE Mediterranean indicate a distinct NW-SE hydro-climatic gradient. A more complex and variable trend is depicted in Lake Ighiel sedimentation during the last similar to 2500 years showing a variable detrital trend likely reflecting an intriguing hydrological pattern which is in agreement with intervals of increased aridity phases during a generally moister period. Comparing our sedimentological results with published pollen records from the nearby area clearly indicates anthropogenic imprints during the Dacian-Roman Period and especially from the Middle Ages towards the present. The similar to 6000-year long sedimentary record of Lake Ighiel contributes to our understanding of mid and late Holocene palaeohydrological changes in the Carpathians and highlights the importance of latitudinal gradients in driving hydrological variability in continental Europe.

Landslide-dammed paleolake perturbs marine sedimentation and drives genetic change in anadromous fish	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Large bedrock landslides have been shown to modulate rates and processes of river activity by forming dams, forcing upstream aggradation of water and sediment, and generating catastrophic outburst floods. Less apparent is the effect of large landslide dams on river ecosystems and marine sedimentation. Combining analyses of 1-m resolution topographic data (acquired via airborne laser mapping) and field investigation, we present evidence for a large, landslide-dammed paleolake along the Eel River, CA. The landslide mass initiated from a high-relief, resistant outcrop which failed catastrophically, blocking the Eel River with an approximately 130-m-tall dam. Support for the resulting 55-km-long, 1.3-km(3) lake includes subtle shorelines cut into bounding terrain, deltas, and lacustrine sediments radiocarbon dated to 22.5 ka. The landslide provides an explanation for the recent genetic divergence of local anadromous (ocean-run) steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) by blocking their migration route and causing gene flow between summer run and winter run reproductive ecotypes. Further, the dam arrested the prodigious flux of sediment down the Eel River; this cessation is recorded in marine sedimentary deposits as a 10-fold reduction in deposition rates of Eel-derived sediment and constitutes a rare example of a terrestrial event transmitted through the dispersal system and recorded offshore.																			0027-8424					NOV 22	2011	108	47					18905	18909		10.1073/pnas.1110445108	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1110445108								22084068					WOS:000297249800017

The interannual component of variability was stronger than fine-scale seasonal dynamics. The interannual variations followed a trend whereby abundance of meio- and macrobenthos as well as biomass of the latter was high in 1985, dropped in 1986 and 1987, and rose again in 1988. As the trend could not be explained by local environmental data, explanation was sought by invoking wider-scale climatic and hydrological processes. Data for severity of winters preceding each year of study as well as trends in atmospheric circulation patterns, wind regimes, river runoff characteristics, and near-bottom conductance (used as a proxy for seawater intrusions into the lagoon) were compared to seasonal anomalies in meiobenthic abundance as well as in macrobenthic abundance and biomass. The seasonal mean meiobenthic log abundance anomalies produced no significant correlation with any of the variables tested. In contrast, the seasonal mean log macrobenthos abundance and biomass anomalies were significantly negatively correlated with winter severity proxies (mean winter temperature and cold sum) and flow rate determined with time lags generally longer than one month. The results provide indication of differences in responses of meio- and macrobenthic communities to climatic (winter severity) and hydrological changes, the long-term effects being visible primarily within the macrobenthos. However, establishing sound causal relationships requires longer time-series of data.

Periphyton communities were examined in three unique but hydrologically connected habitats in the lower Muskegon River: river, wetland, and lake. Our study addressed several major questions: (1) what are the effects of nonpoint source pollutants on periphyton structure and function, (2) to what degree do environmental conditions, including the pollutant delivery system and hydrologic conditions, affect periphyton response, and (3) do periphyton communities show synchronous responses to nonpoint source pollution? Nutrients were added over a 21-day period in each of the four seasons over 2 years. The effect of road salt on metabolism was evaluated in the winter and spring seasons in the river habitat only. In general, the periphyton community showed complex responses to the NPS amendments, but there was little evidence of nutrient limitation in this system based on community structure, biomass accrual, metabolism, or alkaline phosphatase activity. This result was unexpected given the relatively low ambient concentrations of phosphorus. We discuss the possibilities that nutrient delivery was ineffective or that herbivory and/or irradiance might have constrained periphyton growth, but ultimately conclude that our results suggest that periphyton communities in the lower Muskegon River watershed were (1) nutrient-replete, (2) tolerant of short-term salt additions, and (3) influenced more by local conditions (habitat) than by regional (watershed) factors. In systems where nonpoint source pollutant delivery is diffuse and hydrologic residence time is short, the influence of nonpoint source pollutants on periphyton may be either modest or too difficult to detect using traditional endpoints.					; Steinman, Alan/B-8723-2014; Biddanda, Bopaiah/AAB-1705-2019	Steinman, Alan/0000-0002-4886-4305; 													1386-2588	1573-5125				NOV	2011	45	4					439	454		10.1007/s10452-011-9366-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-011-9366-8													WOS:000296632800001

Based on the newly released daily rainfall data, two dominant intraseasonal variation (ISV) modes are identified over the LYRB during boreal summer (May-August), with spectral peaks occurring on day 15 (the biweekly mode) and day 24 (the 21-30-day mode). These two modes have comparable intensities, and together they account for above about 57% of the total intraseasonal variance. Both ISV modes exhibit baroclinic structures over the LYRB at their extreme phases. However. the genesis and evolutions associated with the two modes are different. Considering the genesis of their extreme wet phases over the LYRB, the biweekly mode is initiated by a midlatitude jet stream vorticity anomaly moving southeastward, while the 21-30-day mode is primarily associated with a low-level westward propagation of an anticyclonic anomaly from 145 degrees to 120 degrees E, which reflects the westward extension of the western North Pacific subtropical high (WNPSH). The development of the biweekly mode at LYRB is enhanced by the northwestward movement of a low-level anticyclonic anomaly from the Philippine Sea to the south of Taiwan, which is a result of the enhancement of the WNPSH resulting from its merger with a transient midlatitude high. In contrast, the development of the 21-30-day mode is enhanced by an upper-level trough anomaly moving from Lake Baikal to far east Russia. These two ISV periodicities are also found to be embedded in their corresponding source regions. The new knowledge on the sources and evolutions of the two major LYRB ISV modes provides empirical predictors for the intraseasonal variation in the subtropical EA summer monsoon.

To explore how the application of wetland sediments to agricultural soils affects soil Pb and Cu speciation, sediments from the Baiyangdian Lake are considered in this study. Changes in the speciation of Pb and Cu in soils planted with winter wheat before and after the application of wetland sediments were determined in addition to the concentrations of Pb and Cu in the different organs of winter wheat. As the sediment application rate increased, the amounts of exchangeable Pb and Cu, Pb and Cu bound to carbonates, iron and manganese oxides, and organic matter, and the residual Pb and Cu contents in the soil increased. The accumulation of Pb and Cu in the plant organs decreased as follows: root > stem and leaf > grain. However, the concentrations of Pb and Cu in the wheat grains did not exceed the Chinese standard limits. The winter wheat yield and above-ground biomass increased before decreasing. With increasing sediment application, the amount of Pb taken up by the winter wheat from the soil generally increased, and the amount of Cu taken up by the winter wheat generally increased and then decreased. This research has important practical implications for the effective utilization of lake and wetland sediments.																			1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	4					2550	2556																WOS:000400806100009
J	Tirok, K; Gaedke, U				Tirok, K; Gaedke, U			Spring weather determines the relative importance of ciliates, rotifers and crustaceans for the initiation of the clear-water phase in a large, deep lake	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Clear-water phase (CWP) is an important event in seasonal plankton succession. We examined the influence of all herbivorous zooplankton on its initiation under different weather and climatic conditions using up to 19 years of observations from the large, deep Lake Constance (Europe) and estimates of relative clearance rates. A CWP occurred regularly, even if daphnid biomass was still very low. CWP was attributed to strong grazing either by a daphnid-dominated zooplankton community or by a diverse assemblage consisting of micro- and meso-zooplankton. Both types of zooplankton communities occurred with approximately the same frequency. The timing of the CWP was unrelated to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) but correlated with the wind-dependent intensity of deep vertical mixing 3 months earlier, during early spring. Less mixing enabled early growth of phytoplankton, ciliates and rotifers despite low temperatures, which prevented daphnid development at this time. This resulted in enhanced grazing of ciliates and rotifers, which increased the importance of phytoplankton less edible for most ciliates, rotifers and daphnids. Ciliates clearly dominated the grazing pressure on phytoplankton throughout spring, maintaining high biomasses together with the phytoplankton for up to 2 months.

J	Reichwein, P				Reichwein, PearlAnn			The origins of the Canadian Birkebeiner Ski Festival: invented traditions, winter sportscapes, and heritage sport tourism in sustainability and the UNESCO Beaver Hills Biosphere	JOURNAL OF HERITAGE TOURISM												The Canadian Birkebeiner Ski Festival emerged as the world's third Birkebeiner cross-country ski loppet in 1985, emulating the Norwegian Birkebeiner and the American Birkebeiner. This study examines the early years of the Canadian Birkebeiner as a heritage sport tourism event with routes near Edmonton, Alberta, that became an annual festival and attraction in western Canada. Invented tradition, sportscapes, and heritage sport tourism are a conceptual frame to analyse how the Festival represented the Birkebeiner legends, how skiers and skiing constituted landscapes, and how the event contributed to sustainability. The Canadian Birkebeiner resulted in a winter sport festival and sportscape that shaped cross-country skiing, trails, and public lands, and was indicative of fluid social relations and rural place making by means of skiing. Based on archival and oral history sources, the study argues the Canadian Birkebeiner was an invented tradition that originated with a ski loppet instrumental in the negotiation of terrain for cross-country skiing that contributed to winter sportscapes and heritage sport tourism in the Cooking Lake-Blackfoot Provincial Recreation Area, and, ultimately, within the UNESCO Beaver Hills Biosphere. It contributes to studies of winter events with local and broader implications for sustainable heritage tourism.																			1743-873X	1747-6631				JAN 2	2024	19	1					129	147		10.1080/1743873X.2023.2256898	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1743873X.2023.2256898		SEP 2023											WOS:001072142700001

The Ossola valley	CLIMATIC CHANGE												In this paper, we study centennial trends of climate and snow cover within the Ossola valley, in the Western Italian Alps. We pursue different tests (Mann Kendall MK, bulk, and sequential/progressive MKprog, Linear Regression, also with change point detection, and moving window average MW) on two datasets, namely (i) dataset1, daily temperature, precipitation, snow depth for 9 stations in the area, during 1930-2018, and (ii) dataset2, snow depth and density, measured twice a month (from February 1(st) to June 1(st)) for 47 stations during 2007-2023. We also verify correlation with glacier retreat nearby. In dataset1, we highlight a positive trend for minimum temperature with MK, and Linear Regression. Using MKprog/MW, a negative change of snow cover depth, and duration starting from the late 1980s is found. In dataset2, despite the annual variability in snow cover and 2022-2023 winter drought, we assess the maximum snow water equivalent (SWE) to be delayed with respect to maximum snow depth at high altitude (over a month above 2.700 m a.s.l.), highlighting the effect of settling in decreasing snow depth during spring. We also present a formula linking through Linear Regression the Day of the Year of SWE peak to altitude, relevant to assess the onset of thaw season. Due to the high altitude of the stations, and the paradigmatic nature of the Ossola Valley, hosting Toce River, a main contributor to the Lake Maggiore of Italy, our results are of interest, and can be used as a benchmark for the Italian Alps.					; Dresti, Claudia/ITT-6857-2023	STUCCHI, LEONARDO/0000-0002-8456-7236; 													0165-0009	1573-1480				JUN	2023	176	6							78	10.1007/s10584-023-03548-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-023-03548-7													WOS:001004955000001

However, studies on river stratification have been restricted to rivers below dams or reservoirs affected by their water release and lacked examination of diel stratification and its impact on phytoplankton, in particular. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the degree of thermal stratification, its environmental drivers, and the response of water quality and phytoplankton community against stratification in the mid-lower reach of the Nakdong River, whose morphology has been highly modified, including the construction of eight weirs. We implemented vertical temperature profiling at three study sites, both seasonally and diurnally. From this data, we calculated three stratification indices: relative water column stability (RWCS), Schmidt stability (S), and maximum temperature gradient (Max). These indices showed that most sites experienced diel stratification during summer (mean = RWCS 74.3, S 41.5 J m-2, Max 0.9 degrees C m-1). Principal component analysis showed that stratification significantly led to seasonal and diel variations in the water environment. Solar radiation and air temperature were positive controllers, while a negative controller (in this case, the river flow rate) existed only for diel variation in the stratification. The seasonal shifts in phytoplankton community structure were either insensitive or showed a limited response to the stratification indices. In summer, Microcystis cell abundance and accumulation into the surface water was positively affected by the diel variations in the stratification indices and thermocline instead of with other temperature and nutrient variables. Overall, the results suggest that the river has summer stratification, which is involved in amplifying cyanobacterial bloom intensity. Without a suppressing factor, summer stratification is expected to be recurrent in the river, and thus mitigating the developed stratification is needed by promptly regulating the river flow.

J	Höfer-Öllinger, G				Hoefer-Oellinger, Giorgio			Karst hydrogeological investigations in Salzburg, Austria	GRUNDWASSER												The mountains in the province of Salzburg consist to a large extent of rocks prone to karstification. Between 1967 and 1981, several tracer tests have been carried out in order to determine residence times and catchment areas of springs. Since 2007 these karst areas have been investigated using more modern methods. Five areas (Untersberg, Hagengebirge, Tennengebirge, Leoganger Steinberge and Kitzsteinhorn) are presented here. Beneath the Untersberg, a central underground lake with a surface around 10,000m(2) extends over 3km. Its lake level fluctuates by around 50m. Previously assumed connections between the karst groundwater and the porous aquifers in the surrounding valleys can be excluded. In Hagengebirge, karst head fluctuations exceeding 220m have been documented instrumentally. The most important spring has low mineralization in the dry season and during high discharge periods. With a rising water table, sulfate-bearing evaporite rock masses with lower permeability become flooded which mineralizes the karst groundwater. Water mineralization increases significantly only during periods of decreasing discharge after rain events or snow melt. Head fluctuations in Tennengebirge vary locally between 5 and 75m. Continuous monitoring revealed a lifter system in the Leoganger Steinberge during a flood event, as well as the influence of a nearby hydropower plant on runoff, temperature and electric conductivity of the Kesselfall springs.																			1430-483X	1432-1165				MAR	2020	25	1			SI		15	29		10.1007/s00767-019-00439-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00767-019-00439-6		DEC 2019											WOS:000501372600002

Measuring the uptake of BMPs, including the implementation of conservation tillage, helps gauge the success of policies and programs to promote adoption. Satellites are one way to monitor BMP adoption and Synthetic Aperture Radars (SARs) are of particular interest given their allweather data collection capability. This research investigated coherent change detection (CCD) to determine when farmers harvest and till their fields. A time series of both Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) images was acquired over a site in the Canadian Lake Erie basin, during the autumn of 2021, when farmers were harvesting and tilling fields of corn, soybeans and wheat. 16 CCD pairs were created and coherence values were interpreted based on observations collected for 101 fields. An m-chi decomposition was applied to the RCM data, and the Volume/Surface (V/S) ratio was calculated as an additional source of information to interpret results. Change events due to harvest, tillage, autumn seeding and chemical termination resulted in coherence values below 0.20. The mean and standard deviation for fields with observed change was 0.18 & PLUSMN; 0.03. Coherence values were 0.42 & PLUSMN; 0.15 for fields where no change was noted. Tests confirmed that the coherence associated with changed and unchanged fields was significantly different. Coherence values could also differentiate between some types of management events, including tillage and harvest. CCD could also separate harvest as a function of crop type (corn or soybeans). V/S ratios declined after tillage events but increased after both harvesting and chemical termination. Narrowing the date of harvest and tillage is as important as detecting change. To meet this requirement, Sentinel-1 and RCM CCD products with values below 0.20 (indicating change had occurred), were graphically overlaid. With this approach, the timing of corn harvest was identified as occurring within a 5-day window. The tilling of corn, soybeans and wheat was narrowed to a 4-day window. The results of this research confirmed that CCD can be used to capture change due to autumn agricultural activities, and this technique can also separate change due to harvest and tillage. Finally, this study demonstrated that when data from different SAR missions are combined in a virtual constellation, timing of harvest and tillage can be more precisely defined.

Techniques used varied among areas, but virological and histopathological examination of birds was done in each area. The major clinical sign in cormorants was inability to fly, often with unilateral wing or leg paralysis. Focal nonsuppurative inflammation was present in the brain and spinal cord of cormorants and pelicans. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was isolated from cormorants, a pelican, and a ring-billed gull (Larus delawarensis) from Saskatchewan. Cormorants from Alberta were positive for NDV in an immunofluorescent test. Most of the viruses were classed as velogenic and all had a similar monoclonal antibody profile to viruses from the 1970 to 1974 panzootic. Approximately half of cormorant, pelican, and gull eggs collected from affected colonies in the spring of 1991 had antibody to NDV. Antibody was also present in cormorant eggs from the Great Lakes. No unusual mortality was detected at any colony in 1991. Fledgling cormorants and gulls from colonies where mortality occurred in 1990 did not have antibody to NDV in June-July 1991. The overall extent of mortality among water birds and the source of the virus were not determined.

This study comprehensively evaluates the long-term effects of dredging on the environmental risk and bioavailability of HM (Cu, Ni, Zn, Pb, Cd, Cr, and As) in Lake Taihu, China, by comparing simulated dredged treated (D) and undredged (UD) sediment cores under in-situ conditions for one year. Threshold effect level (TEL), geological accumulation index (Igeo), potential ecological risk index (RI), and ratios of secondary phase and primary phase (RSP) methods were used to assess the environmental risk of sediment HM; and the diffusive gradient in thin-films (DGT) technique was applied to assess the bioavailability of sediment HM. The results indicate that Cd was the most polluted metal assessed by the Igeo and RI method, and that dredging significantly reduced the total content of sediment HM, particularly for Cu, Zn, and Cd, and its Igeo and RI index, but caused a slight effect on its fractionation and distinct effect on RSP index. These indices changed independently and seasonally. Porewater analysis suggested higher HM concentrations in summer and winter may cause corresponding deterioration in overlying water. DGT analysis suggested a large proportion of metal-DOM complexes and showed that dredging reduced the bioavailability of Ni, Cd, and As but had a mixed impact (effective and/or ineffective impact varied with seasons) on other metals. These findings highlight the complexity of dredging effects on sediment HM dynamics, underscoring the importance of seasonal monitoring and multi-geoengineering techniques targeted at total and specific metals.

Basic knowledge of this apex predator has revealed concerns of invasive behaviour and questions regarding its utilization as a biomanipulation species. However, a method enabling its regulation to a required level has not yet been developed. We simulated the impact of angling on the catfish population by method of hook-lines in two post-mining lakes with a monitored population consisting of tagged individuals and in two reservoirs as reference sites. Further, the efficiency of hook-lines as a reducing device was examined and the economic aspects were determined. Catfish population in localities where the species is unwanted or invasive may be efficiently reduced to a harmless level by hook-lines and angling (depending on the approach of anglers). The most efficient time of the year seems to be spring to early summer with catch efficiency of 5.4 individuals per 10 baits in one day. The catch efficiency markedly decreased during the second part of the year and did not exceed 2.8 individuals per 10 baits in one day. Mean size of catfish had negative impact whereas catfish biomass had positive impact on the catch efficiency. Trophic status and number of catfish in the locality had no impact on the catch efficiency. According to model, 11-18 bait-days per 1 ha per season is efficient to decrease catfish population to 10% of the original size. Both angling and hook-lines are very simple, they are financially and time bearable mechanisms of catfish regulation in any condition. However, catfish play an important role as a biomanipulative species in many localities. In this case where catfish is beneficial, angling presents a real threat of population collapse and loss of the biomanipulative effect.
