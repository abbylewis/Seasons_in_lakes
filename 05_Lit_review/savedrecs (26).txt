J	Zhang, ZQ; Yao, Q; Bianchette, TA; Liu, KB; Wang, GP				Zhang, Zhenqing; Yao, Qiang; Bianchette, Thomas A.; Liu, Kam-biu; Wang, Guoping			A multi-proxy quantitative record of Holocene hydrological regime on the Heixiazi Island (NE China): indications for the evolution of East Asian summer monsoon	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												The Holocene hydrological regime on the Heixiazi Island is critical for understanding the evolution of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) for the island's climate-sensitive location on the northern fringe of the EASM domain. In this paper, a marsh depression on the central island was selected to reconstruct the locally hydrological variation and to discuss its indications for the Holocene EASM evolution. This work is based on multi-proxy (magnetic susceptibility, grain size, loss-on-ignition, and carbonate content) analyses of 22 modern sedimentary samples with a water-level gradient of 0-66cm and 100 cored sedimentary samples covering last similar to 9.0ka BP. The proxies' hydrological significance was previously interpreted by the 22 modern samples using linear regression equations to construct their relationships to water-level changes. Among these proxies, the magnetic susceptibility, carbonate content, as well as the Md and sand fraction of grain size exhibit high-level relationships against the water-level changes with R-2>0.6. Thus, these four proxies' linear-regression equations were selected and used on the 100 cored samples, and the Holocene water-level changes in the studied depression were quantitatively reconstructed. It shows that two relatively high water-level stages with strengthened EASM occurred during 8.0-4.5ka BP and 3.0-1.4ka BP, which were alternated by three low water-level stages with declined EASM during similar to 9.0-8.0ka BP, 4.5-3.0ka BP, and 1.4-0ka BP, respectively. Among these fluctuations, the highest water-level stage with most strengthened EASM which is defined as the Holocene Monsoon Maximum occurred during 6.4-4.5ka BP. Such a new evolution pattern of the EASM can be further supported by a large variety of records from monsoon-margin regions. We suggest the Holocene EASM evolution was generally associated with the thermal conditions in both the inner Eurasia landmass and the West Pacific Ocean, with an exception of the weak EASM before 8.0ka BP due to the enhanced Siberia High with the dominance of the Eurasia ice sheet in the early Holocene.					; Liu, Kam-Biu/B-4966-2012; Wang, Guoping/A-8140-2008	zhang, zhenqing/0000-0003-2820-6775; Yao, Qiang/0000-0003-4833-7510													0930-7575	1432-0894				JUN	2019	52	11					6773	6786		10.1007/s00382-018-4544-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4544-1													WOS:000469016700027

For eight species, counts were compared with a national index constructed from similar counts at numerous lakes and coastal sites. For Crested Grebes and Mute Swans there was a correlation between counts at Lake Takern and the national index, suggesting that they simultaneously vary in number over a large geographic area. Indirect gradient analysis (PCA) revealed a strong temporal trend in the data, which was covaried out in a partial PCA to expose residual patterns. This ordination separated Pochards and Tufted Ducks at one end of the first axis from Cormorants and Goosanders at the other. A direct gradient analysis, with biomass of submerged macrophytes (recorded for 14 of the 25 years) as the sole environmental variable, showed that bird species composition varied significantly with plant biomass. The piscivores, Cormorants and Goosanders, were abundant in years with small amounts of plant biomass, while several species were most abundant in years with large amounts. Our analyses suggest that the abundance of submerged macrophytes is an important determinant of the bird community composition in eutrophic lakes.

J	Landi, P; Bertagnini, A; Rosi, M				Landi, P; Bertagnini, A; Rosi, M			Chemical zoning and crystallization mechanisms in the magma chamber of the Pomici di Base plinian eruption of Somma-Vesuvius (ItaIy)	CONTRIBUTIONS TO MINERALOGY AND PETROLOGY												Products of the Pomici di Base plinian eruption of Somma-Vesuvius consist of pumice and scoria fall deposits overlain by lithic-rich phreatomagmatic deposits. The plinian fall, which represents most of the magma volume involved in the eruption, ranges in composition from trachyte (SiO2 = 62.5 wt%) to latite (SiO2 approximate to 58 wt%) in the lower one-third of the deposit, whereas the upper two-thirds of the total thickness consists of latitic scoriae with fairly uniform composition (SiO2 approximate to 55-56 wt%). All the products have very low content of phenocrysts (from 4 wt% in trachyte pumice to 1 wt% in the latite scoriae), most of which are not in equilibrium with the host rock. Minerals not in equilibrium, both in trachytic and latitic rocks, consist of discrete crystals of sanidine and plagioclase wetted by trachytic glass and felsic aggregates with interstital trachytic glass. Trends of major and trace elements are consistent with crystal-liquid fractionation processes and rule out syn-eruptive mixing processes between latitic and trachytic magmas. We suggest that discrete crystals and crystal aggregates not in equilibrium with the host rock represent fragments of the crystallising boundary layer at the upper walls of the magma chamber, which were wrenched and admired into the magma during the ascent. This process diversifies the mineral assemblage and increases the crystal content of the rocks. We propose that diffusive crystallization processes operating at the wall of the chamber allowed the formation of a two-fold layered reservoir with a more mafic, homogeneous lower body and a more evolved, compositionally graded upper body. Around one-quarter of crystals adhering to the upper part of the magma chamber were admired into the magma during the eruption. The absence of significant syn-eruptive mixing processes and the major role played by diffusive crystallization are consistent with a low aspect ratio magma chamber (width/height <1).

The strength of stratification substantially influences the transport of dissolved oxygen from the surface to the bottom water of a lake. In recent years, the decrease in dissolved oxygen at the bottom of the northern part of the Lake Biwa, the largest freshwater lake in Japan, has been observed. The main cause of this is considered to be the change in stratification, which depends on weather and climate conditions. In the present study, numerical simulations were carried out to investigate the effect of strong wind on the structure of stratification in Lake Biwa. The baseline simulation was conducted using actual meteorological data, and experimental simulations were conducted using meteorological data with modified wind speed and direction. The numerical experiments showed that if the magnitude of the wind is strong enough, the stratification collapses and the wind can enhance the vertical mixing in the bottom layer even in the summer season with strong thermal stratification. In a stratified season, when the strong wind blows predominantly in one direction, the rate of the vertical mixing changes by the wind direction. Moreover, as the duration of the strong wind extends, vertical mixing easily occurs.					; Koue, Jinichi/HHM-4256-2022	Shimadera, Hikari/0000-0002-2233-8446; KONDO, AKIRA/0000-0001-8621-2378; MATSUO, Tomohito/0000-0002-9379-4385; Koue, Jinichi/0000-0003-2542-614X													2186-2982	2186-2990				MAY	2018	14	45					35	40		10.21660/2018.45.7166	http://dx.doi.org/10.21660/2018.45.7166													WOS:000429530100006

Seasonal variations in Greenland Ice Sheet motion: Inland extent and behaviour at higher elevations	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												We present global positioning system observations that capture the full inland extent of ice motion variations in 2009 along a transect in the west Greenland Ice sheet margin. In situ measurements of air temperature and surface ablation, and satellite monitoring of ice surface albedo and supraglacial lake drainage are used to investigate hydrological controls on ice velocity changes. We find a strong positive correlation between rates of annual ablation and changes in annual ice motion along the transect, with sites nearest the ice sheet margin experiencing greater annual variations in ice motion (15-18%) than those above 1000 m elevation (3-8%). Patterns in the timing and rate of meltwater delivery to the ice-bed interface provide key controls on the magnitude of hydrologically-forced velocity variations at each site. In the lower ablation zone, the overall contribution of variations in ice motion to annual flow rates is limited by evolution in the structure of the subglacial drainage system. At sites in the upper ablation zone, a shorter period of summer melting and delayed establishment of a hydraulic connection between the ice sheet surface and its bed limit the timeframe for velocity variations to occur. Our data suggest that land-terminating sections of the Greenland Ice Sheet will experience increased dynamic mass loss in a warmer climate, as the behaviour that we observe in the lower ablation zone propagates further inland. Findings from this study provide a conceptual framework to understand the impact of hydrologically-forced velocity variations on the future mass balance of land-terminating sections of the Greenland Ice Sheet.

Development and validation of a reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction for tilapia lake virus detection in clinical samples and experimentally challenged fish	JOURNAL OF FISH DISEASES												Tilapia lake virus (TiLV) is an emerging pathogen associated with high mortalities of wild and farm-raised tilapia in different countries. In this study, a SYBR green-based reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay targeting segment three of the virus was developed to detect and quantify TiLV in clinical samples and experimentally challenged fish. All 30 field samples with clinical signs and history consistent with TiLV infection were positive for TiLV as detected by the developed RT-qPCR method. The RT-qPCR technique provided 100 and 10,000 times more sensitive for virus detection than those offered by the RT-PCR and virus isolation in cell culture methods, respectively. The detection limit of the RT-qPCR method was as low as two viral copies/mu l. Moreover, the RT-qPCR technique could be applied for TiLV detection in various fish tissues including gills, liver, brain, heart, anterior kidney and spleen. Significantly, this study delivered an accurate and reliable method for rapid detection of TiLV viruses that facilitates active surveillance programme and disease containment.					; Sirikanchana, Kwanrawee/I-4356-2019; SURACHETPONG, WIN/N-9650-2019	SURACHETPONG, WIN/0000-0002-5707-3476; Tattiyapong, Puntanat/0000-0002-9722-5569; Sirikanchana, Kwanrawee/0000-0001-7273-4060; 													0140-7775	1365-2761				FEB	2018	41	2					255	261		10.1111/jfd.12708	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfd.12708								29027697					WOS:000419719200008

Comparison of growth physiology, morphology, and smolt indicators in juvenile Lake Superior brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) strains in reference to life history variation	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Lake Superior supports fluvial, adfluvial, and lacustrine populations of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). Adfluvial and lacustrine populations (termed coasters) are known for their large size and are coveted by anglers; however, little is known about their migratory habits or physiology. This study examined physiology and morphology of age 1+ lacustrine, adfluvial, and fluvial strains of brook trout in a laboratory setting. All strains in the study grew; however, there were no differences in growth rate, condition, relative mass, morphology, white muscle metabolic enzymes, or gill Na+, K+-ATPase that clearly associated with putative life history strategy. Both thyroxine and triiodothyronine varied over the study period, and the fluvial (resident) strain consistently showed lower thyroid hormone levels than the three coaster strains. We conclude that the populations compared differed at the strain level, but do not show physiological or morphological variability that clearly associates with life history strategy; the exception was that populations demonstrating the coaster phenotype had increased concentrations of plasma thyroid hormones, which may be linked to growth potential or other coaster-related characteristics such as migration.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				OCT	2012	69	10					1596	1609		10.1139/F2012-083	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F2012-083													WOS:000309959900004
J	Zhu, D; Wu, Y; Chen, H; He, YX; Wu, N				Zhu, Dan; Wu, Yan; Chen, Huai; He, Yixin; Wu, Ning			Intense methane ebullition from open water area of a shallow peatland lake on the eastern Tibetan Plateau	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Methane fluxes from a shallow peatland lake (3450 m a.s.l., 1.6 km(2) in area, maximum depth <1 m) on eastern Tibetan Plateau were measured with floating chamber method during May to August, 2009. The overall average of methane emission rate during the study period was 34.71 +/- 29.15 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1). The occurrence of ebullition among the overall methane flux from Lake Medo was about 74%. The average rate of ebullition was 32.45 +/- 28.31 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), which accounted for 93% of the overall average of methane emission. Significant seasonal variation was found for occurrence (P < 0.05) and rate (P < 0.01) of ebullition, both peaking synchronously in mid-summer. Both the occurrence and rate of ebullition were found positively related to sediment temperature but negatively related to lake water depth. The high methane production in the lake sediment was likely fueled by organic carbon loaded from surrounding peatlands to the lake. The shallowness of the water column could be another important favorable factor for methane-containing bubble formation in the sediment and their transportation to the atmosphere. The methane ebullition must have been enhanced by the low atmospheric pressure (ca. 672 hPa) in the high-altitude environment. For a better understanding on the mechanism of methane emission from alpine lakes, more lakes on the Tibetan Plateau should be studied in the future for their methane ebullition.

We determined the short-term effects of nutrient enrichment and predation on the microbial food-webs of oligotrophic Lake Manapouri and eutrophic Lake Hayes, New Zealand, in summer, by adding calanoid copepods (Boeckella hamata Brehm) and cladocerans (Daphnia carinata King) to in situ enclosures in the presence and absence of added nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus). In Lake Manapouri, bacteria and phytoplankton, but not picocyanobacteria, increased in response to nutrients; Daphnia reduced the densities of phytoplankton, bacteria, heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF), and ciliates; and Boeckella lower the densities of HNF and ciliates. In Lake Hayes, the growth of bacteria, HNF, and phytoplankton, including eukaryotic picoautotrophs, was enhanced by enrichment; Daphnia depressed the concentrations of picoautotrophs and HNF, whereas Boeckella decreased the density of ciliates. In both lakes, Boeckella removed ciliates at higher rates per unit biomass than Daphnia. Our study provides clear evidence of stimulation and inhibition of picoplankton by nutrients, and of potential consumer-mediated control of microbial food-webs by crustacean zooplankton.																			0028-8330	1175-8805				SEP	2001	35	4					695	710		10.1080/00288330.2001.9517036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.2001.9517036													WOS:000173845300006

Geochemical drivers of manganese removal in drinking water reservoirs under hypolimnetic oxygenation	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Manganese (Mn) is a naturally occurring contaminant commonly found in drinking water supplies. In lakes and reservoirs, water authorities increasingly use in situ treatment by hypolimnetic oxygenation (HOx) systems to remove metals such as Mn from the water column. HOx systems introduce dissolved oxygen (DO) to the bottom waters (hypolimnion) to promote oxidation and subsequent removal of metals from the water column. Previous laboratory studies have shown the importance of individual geochemical drivers (pH, alkalinity, mineral surfaces) on Mn oxidation, but few studies have examined the influence of these drivers of Mn removal in concert. In this study, we conducted field monitoring and laboratory experiments to examine how pH, alkalinity and the presence of mineral particles influence Mn removal at two drinking water reservoirs in southwest Virginia, both with HOx systems: Falling Creek Reservoir (FCR) and Carvins Cove Reservoir (CCR). Both reservoirs have had historical issues with elevated (>0.05 mg/L) Mn concentrations during seasonal stratification (May-October). Watershed geology contributes to differences in pH and alkalinity between the reservoirs, with FCR having lower historical medians of hypolimnetic pH and alkalinity (6.6 and 18 mg/L CaCO3, respectively) than CCR (7.2 and 62 mg/L CaCO3, respectively). Results of laboratory experiments examining the influence of pH on Mn removal showed substantial Mn loss within 14 days only under high pH (10) conditions. Mn removal did not occur at pH 6 or 8 over the same 14-day period. In experiments with pH 10 and alkalinity >70 mg/L CaCO3, near-total Mn removal occurred within 2 h. Mn removal occurred concurrently with precipitation of microscopic (<5 mu m) particles, followed by formation of macroscopic (>100 mu m) particles. Particles of both size classes were identified as Mn oxides (MnOx). These observations suggest that increasing pH and alkalinity promotes Mn oxidation and subsequent removal from solution. Results of experiments with pH 10 and alkalinity >70 mg/L CaCO3 suggest that heterogeneous oxidation by MnOx partially drives rapid Mn removal. Thus, initial formation of MnOx creates a positive feedback loop that can enhance additional Mn loss. In experiments using water collected from FCR and CCR, we observed rapid Mn removal in unfiltered water (0.002-0.05 d(-1)) but no significant removal of Mn in filtered water. These results, in combination with results of analysis of particles collected from reservoir water, suggest that minerals present in the water column likely catalyze MnOx formation. Together, our experimental results suggest that heterogenous oxidation is an important process of Mn removal, while pH and alkalinity variations of the range expected in natural freshwaters contribute less to differential Mn removal. The formation of MnOx particles during in situ oxygenation, as well as the presence of suspended minerals that occur naturally in water columns, play an important role in promoting Mn oxidation and should be accounted for in Mn removal treatment strategies.					; Schreiber, Madeline/A-5356-2009	Breef-Pilz, Adrienne/0000-0002-6759-0063; 													0883-2927	1872-9134				OCT	2024	172								106120	10.1016/j.apgeochem.2024.106120	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2024.106120		JUL 2024											WOS:001287522200001

In the past few years, deep reinforcement learning has been widely used to solve various decision-making problems. However, due to the characteristics of neural networks, it is very easy to fall into local minima when facing small scale discrete space path planning problems. Traditional reinforcement learning uses continuous updating of a single agent when algorithm executes, which leads to a slow convergence speed. Although some scholars have done some improvement work to solve these problems, there are still many shortcomings to be overcome. In order to solve the above problems, we proposed a new asynchronous tabular reinforcement learning algorithms framework in this paper, and present four new variants of asynchronous reinforcement learning algorithms. We apply these algorithms on the standard reinforcement learning environments: frozen lake problem, cliff walking problem and windy gridworld problem, and the simulation results show that these methods can solve discrete space path planning problems efficiently and well balance the exploration and exploitation.					; Zhao, Xingyu/LTC-9191-2024	Zhao, Xingyu/0000-0001-6541-3445; 													0924-669X	1573-7497				DEC	2019	49	12					4303	4318		10.1007/s10489-019-01501-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10489-019-01501-9													WOS:000496315100014

Phytoplankton community responses in a shallow lake following lanthanum-bentonite application	WATER RESEARCH												The release of phosphorus (P) from bed sediments to the overlying water can delay the recovery of lakes for decades following reductions in catchment contributions, preventing water quality targets being met within timeframes set out by environmental legislation (e.g. EU Water Framework Directive: WFD). Therefore supplementary solutions for restoring lakes have been explored, including the capping of sediment P sources using a lanthanum (La)-modified bentonite clay to reduce internal P loading and enhance the recovery process. Here we present results from Loch Flemington where the first long-term field trial documenting responses of phytoplankton community structure and abundance, and the UK WFD phytoplankton metric to a La-bentonite application was performed. A Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) analysis was used to distinguish natural variability from treatment effect and confirmed significant reductions in the magnitude of summer cyanobacterial blooms in Loch Flemington, relative to the control site, following La-bentonite application. However this initial cyanobacterial response was not sustained beyond two years after application, which implied that the reduction in internal P loading was short-lived; several possible explanations for this are discussed. One reason is that this ecological quality indicator is sensitive to inter-annual variability in weather patterns, particularly summer rainfall and water temperature. Over the monitoring period, the phytoplankton community structure of Loch Flemington became less dominated by cyanobacteria and more functionally diverse. This resulted in continual improvements in the phytoplankton compositional and abundance metrics, which were not observed at the control site, and may suggest an ecological response to the sustained reduction in filterable reactive phosphorus (FRP) concentration following La-bentonite application. Overall, phytoplankton classification indicated that the lake moved from poor to moderate ecological status but did not reach the proxy water quality target (i.e. WFD Good Ecological Status) within four years of the application. As for many other shallow lakes, the effective control of internal P loading in Loch Flemington will require further implementation of both in-lake and catchment-based measures.

J	Jennings, MJ; Kampa, JM; Hatzenbeler, GR; Emmons, EE				Jennings, MJ; Kampa, JM; Hatzenbeler, GR; Emmons, EE			Evaluation of supplemental walleye stocking in northern Wisconsin lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Supplemental stocking of walleye Sander vitreus is an important component of fishery management programs in North America. We conducted an experimental study in 23 northern Wisconsin lakes over a 4-year period to assess differences in year-class strength with and without supplemental stocking. These study lakes all hosted walleye fisheries targeting mixed-recruitment populations (i.e., ones with both natural reproduction and supplemental stocking). We tested for differences in catch per effort (CPE) between stocked and nonstocked years using a general linear mixed model. Catch per effort of age-0 walleyes was 2.3 greater per shoreline mile when lakes were stocked, suggesting that stocking increases year-class strength by about 0.13 age-0 walleyes/acre. Catch per effort values approximated a Poisson distribution, most lakes showing low CPE of age-0 walleyes whether or not they were stocked. Stocked fingerlings were marked with oxytetracycline as fry to determine the percent contribution of stocked fish to the year-class and to estimate 3-month survival. The mean survival of stocked fingerlings until autumn was 3.4%. Results for individual lakes varied, and these differences may be useful for managers in prioritizing waters for stocking. One lake showed strong survival of stocked fish and increases over nonstocked year-classes during both stocking events; this is consistent with literature reports documenting successful supplemental stocking in 5% of case histories.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2005	25	3					1171	1178		10.1577/M04-218.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M04-218.1													WOS:000231336800040
J	Fort, M				Fort, Monique			Natural hazards versus climate change and their potential impacts in the dry, northern Himalayas: focus on the upper Kali Gandaki (Mustang District, Nepal)	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												In the Himalayas, the consequences of climate change are a fairly debated issue, mainly questioning the availability of water resources to the lowland population. North of the monsoon Himalayas, a semi-arid, continental climate prevails and settlements rely economically mostly on irrigated crops, high altitude rangelands, trade and tourism. The upper Kali Gandaki (Mustang) is situated in this area, with sharp contrasts between valley bottoms (<3,000 m) and high, glaciated peaks (up to >8,000 m). The impacts of climate change may appear in different ways. Gullying is common, and might increase with greater climate variability. Increased ground instabilities (earth-flows and occasional debris flows) affecting extensive shale/marly substrates are also expected, linked to changes in snow cover and seasonality. Similarly, the combination of higher snowfall and rapid melting may favour the occurrence of flash floods. The possibility of glacial outburst floods is less probable because of the present limited glaciation. Eventually, permafrost melting may induce rock avalanches down the steepest cliffs and might impact the adjacent valley floors. Collectively, these hazards will affect irrigation canals and fields, new infrastructures and the associated growing settlements. Water availability in the near future is more difficult to predict; however, any change in the amount and nature of precipitation may affect groundwater reserves, hence spring discharge and runoff, with consequences for agricultural products. Eventually, the overall potential increase in natural hazards may jeopardize the development of small markets and the good connection of these upper valleys to the main urban centres of Nepal, a country with a very low economic and social capacity to adjust.																			1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2015	73	2			SI		801	814		10.1007/s12665-014-3087-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-014-3087-y													WOS:000347446400024

Occurrence, spatiotemporal distribution, and ecological risks of steroids in a large shallow Chinese lake, Lake Taihu	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Steroids have been frequently detected in surface waters, and might pose adverse effects on aquatic organisms. However, little information is available regarding the occurrence and spatiotemporal distribution of steroids in lake environments. In addition to pollution sources, the occurrence and spatiotemporal distribution of steroids in lake environments might be related to lake types (shallow or deep), lake hydrodynamics, and sorption-desorption processes in the water-sediment systems. In this study, the occurrence, spatiotemporal distribution, and ecological risks of 36 steroids in a large shallow lake were evaluated by investigating surface water and sediment samples at 32 sites in Lake Taihu over two seasons. Twelve and 15 analytes were detected in aqueous and sedimentary phases, respectively, with total concentrations ranging from 0.86 to 116 ng/L (water) and from 0.82 to 16.2 ng/g (sediment, dry weight). Temporal variations of steroid concentrations in the water and sediments were statistically significant, with higher concentrations in winter. High concentrations of steroids were found in the seriously polluted bays rather than in the pelagic zone of the lake. Strong lake currents might mix pelagic waters, resulting in similar concentrations of steroids in the pelagic zone. Mass balance analysis showed that sediments in shallow lakes are in general an important sink for steroids. Steroids in the surface water and sediments of Lake Taihu might pose potential risks to aquatic organisms. Overall, our study indicated that the concentrations and spatiotemporal distribution of steroids in the large shallow lake are influenced simultaneously by pollution sources and lake hydrodynamics. Capsule: Steroids in the large shallow Lake Taihu showed clear temporal and spatial variations and lake sediments may be a potential sink of steroids. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Characterizing the PAHs in surface waters and snow in the Athabasca region: Implications for identifying hydrological pathways of atmospheric deposition	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The composition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons present in snow and surface waters in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) was characterized in order to identify major contributors to the organics detected in rivers and lakes in the region. PAH concentrations, measured by three monitoring programs in 2011, were used to compare the PAH compositions of snow and surface waters across the AOSR. The 2011 dataset includes total (dissolved + particulate) concentrations of thirty-four parent and alkylated PAH compounds in 105 snow, 272 river, and 3 lake samples. The concentration of PAHs in rivers varies seasonally, with the highest values observed in July. The timing of increases in PAH concentrations in rivers coincides with the high river discharge during the spring freshet, indicating that this major hydrological event may play an important role in delivering PAHs to rivers. However, the composition of PAHs present in rivers during this period differs from the composition of PAHs present in snow, suggesting that direct runoff and release of PAHs accumulated on snow may not be the major source of PAHs to the Athabasca River and its tributaries. Instead, snowmelt may contribute indirectly to increases in PAHs due to hydrological processes such as erosion of stream channels, remobilization of PAH-containing sediments, increased catchment runoff, and snowmelt-induced groundwater inputs during this dynamic hydrologic period. Better understanding of transformations of PAH profiles during transport along surface and subsurface flow paths in wetland-dominated boreal catchments would improve identification of potential sources and pathways in the region. The compositional differences highlight the challenges in identifying the origins of PAHs in a region with multiple potential natural and anthropogenic sources particularly when the potential transport pathways include air, soil and water.

J	Becker, A; Herschel, A; Wilhelm, C				Becker, A; Herschel, A; Wilhelm, C			Biological effects of incomplete destratification of hypertrophic freshwater reservoir	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This paper describes results of partial destratification of a large reservoir with complex morphology. In order to reduce phytoplankton growth by light limitation, the upper 20 m of the water column were destratified in the Bleiloch Reservoir (Thuringia, Germany). Temperatures, phytoplankton, and zooplankton were investigated before and during aeration to determine the effects of the partial destratification on plankton. The measure induced an increase of phytoplankton dynamics. Since 1991 nuisance cyanobacteria blooms increased in the hypertrophic Bleiloch reservoir (Thuringia, Federal Republic of Germany), as light conditions improved due to a reduction of coloured wastewaters supplied by a cellulose mill. Warm inflowing water formed an upper layer, which reached the bubble plume near the dam, and was only weakly affected by the deeper mixed water body. The water column stability decreased, which caused an overturn 2-3 weeks earlier, because the hypolimnion warmed up faster. These physical effects of the destratification delayed the seasonal succession of phytoplankton. Cyanobacteria were suppressed but diatoms and chlorophytes became more abundant. Copepods maintained higher population densities throughout the summer. During artificial mixing, the algal diversity increased, not only because k-strategists selected a stratified water column, but also because episodic thermal instability enabled r- and k-strategists to co-exist in a competitive environment.																			0018-8158					APR	2006	559						85	100		10.1007/s10750-005-4428-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-4428-3													WOS:000235138900005
J	LEMMEN, DS; GILBERT, R; SMOL, JP; HALL, RI				LEMMEN, DS; GILBERT, R; SMOL, JP; HALL, RI			HOLOCENE SEDIMENTATION IN GLACIAL TASIKUTAAQ LAKE, BAFFIN ISLAND	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Tasikutaaq Lake, on Cumberland Peninsula, Baffin Island, receives inflow and fine sediment from a 448 km2 drainage basin, 21% of which is glacier covered. During the summer of 1983 the lake remained essentially isothermal between about 4 and 6.degree.C. The suspended sediment concentration of inflow never exceeded 100 mg L-1, with overflow and homopycnal flow dominant. Surface sediments are clearly laminated, although varves are not apparent. The sediments are very fine, with less than 3% sand in all but the most proximal sites. Average sedimentation rates between 1976 and 1983 ranged from about 4 mm a-1 to 0.25 mm a-1 down lake from the point of inflow. The absence of varves is a function of the low rates of sediment accumulation and the long residence time of the fine sediments in the water column. Three sediment cores up to 135 cm in length reveal marked changes in sediment characteristics and diatom assemblages through the Holocene. During the late Foxe Glaciation it is likely that glacier ice contacted the lake, with retreat upvalley recorded by thinly varved (?) silts. By 7580 .+-. 140 BP ice had retreated to near its present margins. The earliest diatom assemblage in the cores is dominated by small Fragilaria spp., typical of late glacial, pioneering environments. Sedimentation rates during much of the Hypsithermal were about five times less than at present, with the resulting massive sediments having "nonglacial" characteristics despite the presence of glacial ice in the drainage basin. A planktonic diatom flora suggests that summer lake ice cover was minimal at this time. A climatic deterioration at about 4500 BP marks the onset of the Neoglacial, recorded by a shift in the diatom assemblage to species characteristic of more shallow water environments. Retreat from Neoglacial moraines is recorded by clearly laminated sediments and increasing accumulation rates. In general, laminated sediments relate to periods of high sediment input associated with glacial retreat, whereas massive sediments relate to low sediment input in association with glacial stabilization or advance.

Yangtze River is a world class river with complex river-lake relations in the middle reaches. As the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) and other controlled reservoirs in the main stream and tributaries have been put into operation, the water regimes of the main stream in the middle reaches and Poyang Lake have been changed by water impounding and sediments trapping, clean water discharged from reservoirs, accelerating the evolution of the relationship of river and lake. After entering the 21st century, autumn droughts become more serious in Poyang Lake basin; the relationship between river and lake becomes tense. In light of the hydrological data in Poyang Lake since 2000s, this article made quantitative analyses of the influences of the human activities on the variation of the Poyang Lake level by authors. The results indicate that the main stream of Yangtze River, particularly the regulation of Three Gorges Reservoir, exerts a profound influence on the variation process of the Poyang Lake level. The regulation influence of the Upper Reach of the Yangtze River's Reservoir Group (URYRRG) could spread to Tangyin area in the middle of the lake in October.

Prevalence of acute mountain sickness among Finnish trekkers on Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania: an observationl study. High Alt. Med. Biol. 9: 301-306, 2008.-The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of acute mountain sickness (AMS) among trekkers on Mount Kilimanjaro during the winter season of 2006-2007. A A total of 130 Finnish trekkers at Marungu route were asked to complete daily a Lake Louise self-report and clinical assessment score questionnaire with the help of a trainee Finnish guide during their trek to Kilimanjaro. A Lake Louise questionnaire score >= 3 indicated AMS. Altogether 112 mountaineers or travelers [54 men, 58 women, mean age 51 +/- 10 (SD) years] were studied. Fifty-nine travelers (53%) reached Gillman's Point or Uhuru Peak. The incidence of AMS among Finnish Kilimanjaro trekkers was 75%. The most common high altitude symptoms were headache, followed by sleeping problems and fatigue or weakness. The incidence of AMS is high among trekkers climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. The main reason for this seems to be rapid ascent. Kilimanjaro treks normally have a fixed timetable, and for commercial reasons there is little opportunity to spend extra days for acclimatization in the camps. Some contributing factors are preventable, so we recommend an educational program for all the trekking agencies that guide on this peak and, in particular, the Tanzania-based guiding agencies, which, typically, are driving these very fast ascent rates.

The incubations (4 day) were performed at 5 m intervals from the surface to the bottom using natural phytoplankton and zooplankton assemblages, with enrichments of phosphorus and nitrogen. The phytoplankton community was only limited by nutrients in the upper 5 m (epilimnion), as indicated by change in chlorophyll concentration. Nutrient enrichments had the greatest effect on the phytoplankton net growth in June and July. High light inhibited the phytoplankton net growth at the surface. Low light intensities limited phytoplankton at 20 m and below, and at the end of the growing season already around 10-15 m. A deep chlorophyll maximum in the hypolimnion in June-August was not limited by either light or nutrients. The results showed variation in grazers' impact on phytoplankton. These results suggest the importance of nutrient limitation only in the epilimnion with light inhibition at the surface, light limitation in the hypolimnion, and varying impact of zooplankton grazing in influencing the development of the phytoplankton in Castle Lake.

We examined decadal variability in the carbon isotope (delta C-13) composition of subfossil zooplankton (Branchiopoda: Cladocera) in seven large clear perialpine lakes, including three previously studied sites, to decipher different patterns in summer surface CO2 concentrations. Generalized additive models were used to examine whether and how these patterns connect to changing nutrient regimes and anthropogenic warming over the past century. In all but one of the lakes shifts in cladoceran delta C-13 values coincided with turning points in the eutrophication history, broadly implying decreasing summer surface CO2 concentrations driven by phosphorus fertilization of pelagic primary production. Yet where nutrient concentrations remained below mesotrophic levels, the positive relationship between delta C-13 and phosphorus diminished indicating that the strong biotic control of CO2 concentrations was overwritten, probably by catchment inorganic carbon inputs and internal biochemical processes. Even under extensive nutrient loading, the connection was further weakened in lakes with high catchment to lake area ratio attributable to increased catchment interference and shorter water residence times. Warming of the perialpine region was also imprinted in the isotope records, yet the temperature effects appeared modest and were restricted to three smaller lakes with lower drainage ratios. In these lakes, warming contributed to declining cladoceran delta C-13 values likely partially driven by epilimnetic deepening increasing CO2 in surface waters. Overall, our results manifest the broad heterogeneity of lake responses to global change and point to the importance of hydrogeomorphic context in shaping the sensitivity and responses of lake CO2 to changing nutrient regimes and warming at the regional scale.

This study examined changes in wetland vegetation evolution of two deltas, namely Ganjiang Main-branch Delta wetland (GMD) and Ganjiang Southern-branch Delta wetland (GSD), in autumns from 1973 to 2009. Wetland vegetation evolution monitoring using Landsat remotely sensed imageries was related to changes in hydrology stemming including the annual peak, lowest water levels and number of flooded days at four characteristic water levels (10, 13, 15 and 17 m) from natural climatic variations. Results showed that the annual peak water level of GMD (Xingzi station) decreased by 5.78 m and the annual lowest water level decreased by 2.27 m; while the annual peak water level of GSD (Tangyin station) decreased by 6.41 m and the annual lowest water level decreased by 2.53 m. The number of flooded days at water levels 15 and 17 m indicated a consistent trend while flooded days at water levels 10 and 13 m were significantly different. Vegetation coverage of both deltas showed trends of increasing and expanded fan-shaped towards the middle of the lake area. The annual peak and lowest water levels had negative correlation with the vegetation coverage areas for both deltas. The flooded days at water level 13 m had the greatest effect on the vegetation coverage area at GMD; while the flooded days at water level 17 m had the greatest effect on the vegetation coverage area at GSD.

Part I. Analysis of ion and trace metal concentrations	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												This study provides a description of water chemistry in river-lake systems located in central Mongolia, at the borderline of permafrost occurrence. The analysis involved water samples collected from two river-lake systems: Baydrag River-Boon Tsagaan Lake system, and Shargalyuut/Tuyn Rivers-Orog Lake system. In the water samples, ions and trace elements were detected and quantified. Additionally, the parameters of pH, electrical conductivity (SEC), total dissolved solids (TDS) and total organic carbon (TOC) were determined. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on the sample results. Water chemistry is mostly influenced by geochemical and hydrometeorological processes. Permafrost thawing could increase the concentration of nitrogen (NH4+, NO3-) as well as Na+ and Ca2+, Cl- and SO42-. However, it may also be an effect of other factors such as livestock farming. Seasonal drying out of lakes (e.g., Lake Orog) may also influence water chemistry by deflation of evaporites from exposed lake beds and, at the same time, with lower concentration of chemical compounds in water. The PCA shows that water samples can be divided into two groups. The first group contains lake samples, where water chemistry is shaped by prevailing evaporation processes, whereas the second includes samples from rivers and springs.

Advances in the use of molecular tools in ecological and biodiversity assessment of aquatic ecosystems	LIMNETICA					19th Congress of the Iberian-Association-of-Limnology (AIL)	JUN 24-29, 2018	Coimbra, PORTUGAL	Iberian Assoc Limnol, Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Univ Coimbra, Associacao Promocao Conhecimento Ecologia Aquqtica				Conservation and sustainable management of aquatic ecosystems is a priority in environmental programs worldwide. However, these aims are highly dependent on the efficiency, accuracy and cost of existent methods for the detection of keystone species and monitoring of biological communities. Rapid advances in eDNA, barcoding and metabarcoding promoted by high-throughput sequencing technologies are generating millions of sequences in a fast way, with a promising cost reduction, and overcoming some difficulties of the traditional taxonomic approaches. This paper provides an updated broad perspective of the current developments in this dynamic field presented in the special session (SS) "The use of molecular tools in ecological and biodiversity assessment of aquatic ecosystems" of the XIX Congress of the Iberian Association of Limnology (AIL2018), held in Coimbra, Portugal. Developments presented are mainly focused on the Iberian Peninsula (Portugal and Spain, including Atlantic Macaronesian islands) but include studies in France, Germany, Finland, Russia (Siberia) and South America. The networks within which these researchers are involved are yet even broader, profiting from existing molecular facilities, and traditional taxonomic expertise, which can be viewed as a characteristic of this new research area. It was evident in the SS that the use of molecular tools is widespread, being used to study a diversity of aquatic systems, from rivers' headwaters to estuaries and coastal lagoons, and volcanic, mountain and frozen lakes to hot springs. The organisms targeted are likewise varied and include fish, macroinvertebrates, meiofauna, microalgae such as diatoms and dinoflagellates, other protists, fungi, and bacteria (cyanobacteria and other). Some studies address the whole biodiversity (i.e., all species present independently of the taxonomic group) from environmental samples of water, biofilms and preservative solution from field samples (e.g., ethanol from macroinvertebrate samples). Great advances were acknowledged in the special session, namely in the use of metabarcoding for detecting hidden biodiversity, juvenile stages, low-abundance species, non-indigenous species and toxicity potential, and ultimately for ecological monitoring of diatoms and invertebrates. Yet, several drawbacks were highlighted and need further work, which include: taxonomic gaps in the reference databases (including gaps at species level and on intraspecific variability) or absence of public databases (e.g. for meiofauna), still high sequencing costs, the need of a substantial bioinformatics effort, difficulties in establishing the amount of environmental sample necessary for a good DNA extraction and the need for testing different genetic markers to obtain accurate results.					; Garcia-Vazquez, Eva/Y-7293-2019; Feio, Maria Joao/AAF-2628-2021; Filipe, Ana Filipa/B-5573-2008; Nieminen, Marko/F-9250-2011; Feio, Maria/AAF-2628-2021; Goncalves, Vitor/F-2725-2012; Barquín Ortiz, José/N-5010-2014; Cordeiro, Rita/IWE-1059-2023; Almeida, Salomé/U-9484-2019; Vieites, David/B-4481-2009; Duarte, Sofia/H-3323-2013; Fais, Maria/H-4108-2018; Ardura, ba/B-3355-2019; Cordeiro, Rita/A-9421-2017; Garcia Raventós, Aina/AAV-7235-2020; Sáinz-Bariáin, Marta/B-4770-2018; Barquin Ortiz, Jose/N-5010-2014; Beja, Pedro/A-7851-2008; Diaz-de-Quijano, Daniel/AAC-2814-2021; Fonseca, Maria/HOA-7676-2023; PLANES, Serge/ABF-1360-2021; Costa, Filipe/B-5890-2009; Trusova, Maria/N-6568-2018; Murria, Cesc/L-4620-2013; Gonçalves, Vítor/F-2725-2012	Ardura Gutierrez, Alba/0000-0003-2598-6534; Beja, Pedro/0000-0001-8164-0760; Feio, Maria Joao/0000-0003-0362-6802; Filipe, Ana Filipa/0000-0001-7862-2676; Goncalves, Vitor/0000-0002-5737-296X; Sainz Bariain, Marta/0000-0001-9427-3680; Garcia-Vazquez, Eva/0000-0002-8429-838X; Vieites, David/0000-0001-5551-7419; Duarte, Sofia/0000-0002-0181-0676; Fais, Maria/0000-0003-1189-2545; Fonseca, Amelia/0000-0002-1668-2363; Cordeiro, Rita/0000-0001-8713-6370; Martins, Filipa/0000-0003-4191-5031; Barquin Ortiz, Jose/0000-0003-1897-2636; Diaz-de-Quijano, Daniel/0000-0002-2231-5957; Almeida, Salome/0000-0001-7240-7967; Ivanova, Elena/0000-0002-3220-103X; Garcia-Raventos, Aina/0000-0003-2373-179X; Costa, Filipe/0000-0001-5398-3942; Murria, Cesc/0000-0003-4319-0804; 													0213-8409	1989-1806					2020	39	1					419	440		10.23818/limn.39.27	http://dx.doi.org/10.23818/limn.39.27													WOS:000509685900028

These changes reflect the hydrological conditions in the drainage system as well as residence time of C-14 in the mixed surface layer of the lake and its lower brine. Long-term isolation of the lower brine led to C-14 decay and an increase in the reservoir age. Yet, enhanced runoff input with atmospheric C-14 brings the reservoir age down. The highest reservoir age of 6 ka was recorded after the sharp fall of the Dead Sea at similar to8.1 ka cal BP. The lower reservoir age of zero was recorded between 36 and 32 ka cal BP, when the Lake Lisan mixed layer was frequently replenished by runoff.

The studied samples displayed a variable range between (delta(56)Fe-2.03 parts per thousand and 0.36 parts per thousand. Aerosols and phytoplanktons have similar or slightly heavier Fe isotope compositions relative to the average of igneous rocks. Fe isotope compositions of riverine Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) were mainly affected by the types of tributaries. Suspended particulates collected from tributaries seriously contaminated with coal mine drainages displayed negative delta(56)Fe values (-0.89 parts per thousand to -0.31 parts per thousand) during summer, and there were significant increases of delta(56)Fe values in winter, except AR2, which was polluted with both coal mine drainage and sewage effluent. Characteristics of lakes have important influences on Fe isotope compositions of suspended particulates, lake sediments, and porewaters. The epilimnetic particulate Fe of Lake Hongfeng had delta(56)Fe=-0.04 parts per thousand to 0.13 parts per thousand, while lighter Fe isotope compositions were measured for particulate Fe from Lake Aha, ranging from -0.42 parts per thousand to -0.09 parts per thousand. Sediments collected from Hon Wu (HW) station of Lake Hongfeng have an average delta(56)Fe value of 0.09 parts per thousand and their corresponding porewaters have lighter Fe isotope compositions, ranging from -0.57 parts per thousand to -0.31 parts per thousand; no significant variations have been observed. For the Liang Jiang Kou (LJK) station of Lake Aha, the content of reactive Fe and the concentration of sulfate were all high. Due to the reactive Fe recycling, including dissimilatory Fe reduction, adsorption, and Fe sulfide formation, porewaters sampled near the sediment surface have been found to have a delta(56)Fe value as low as -2.03 parts per thousand and an increase up to 0.12 parts per thousand, with a burial depth of 10 cm. In contrast, an opposite variation trend was found for LJK sediments. Sediments sampled at 1-cm depth had a value of delta(56)Fe=-0.59 parts per thousand and decrease as low as -1.75 parts per thousand with burial depth. This investigation demonstrated that significant Fe isotope fractionations occur in surface environments. Fe isotope compositions of particulate Fe were seriously affected by Fe sources, and Fe biogeochemical recycling has an important influence on Fe isotope fractionations in lake sediments, especially when there are significant amounts of reactive Fe and sulfate.

J	Hansen, AM; Hairston, NG				Hansen, AM; Hairston, NG			Food limitation in a wild cyclopoid copepod population: direct and indirect life history responses	OECOLOGIA												We studied the effects of food limitation on the population dynamics of the freshwater cyclopoid copt pod Diacyclops thomasi in Oneida Lake, New York. In the field population. maximum juvenile abundance coincided seasonally with high phytoflagellate concentration. During the clear-water phase (a seasonal period of low algal density), D. thomasi disappeared from the water column, but fourth-instar copepodids (CIV) were found encysted in developmental arrest in the sediment. Laboratory assays of the effect of the density of two types of food on copepod life history parameters showed that temporal variation in the concentration of relatively small phytoflagellates significantly affected stage-specific development times. This food limitation was most pronounced during the clear-water phase, and supplementation of the diet with a laboratory-cultured phytoflagellate, Chlamydomonas, prevented food limitation. Although developmental arrest appears to be controlled primarily by photoperiod, availability of the larger, more mobile food, Euglena, also influenced the percentage of individuals entering developmental arrest in the laboratory. An investigation of the spatial and temporal emergence pattern in the field revealed that CIV copepodids started to emerge in late autumn and that emergence rates were significantly greater at deepwater locations (9-12 m water depth) compared with shallow-water locations (5-7 m). The clear-water phase in Oneida Lake is an annual event. probably produced by intense grazing by Daphnia pulicaria and Daphnia galeata. Food limitation is thus very likely a recurrent phenomenon for D, thomasi. This apparent seasonal competitive impact of Daphnia on Diacyclops affects both nauplii and immature copepodids. Diacyclops shows two types of responses to the food limitation: (1) the physiological response of slowed active development, and (2) the adaptive response of developmental arrest.																			0029-8549	1432-1939				JUL	1998	115	3					320	330		10.1007/s004420050523	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004420050523								28308422					WOS:000074877400005

The differences of bacteriological parameters among sites across beach horizontal profile were determined. Maximal value of the total bacteria numbers (8.59 +/- 0.73 X 10(7) cells g(-1) dw), biomass (15.2 +/- 4.4 mu g C g-1 dw) and cell volume of bacterium (0.056 +/- 0.011 mu m(3)) was noted at the waterline and bacterial secondary production was highest in the dune (172.3 +/- 86.6 mu g C g(-1) dw d(-1)) and at the waterline (119.9 +/- 40.5 mu g C g(-1) dw d(-1)). Marked differences in the level of bacteriological parameters between surface and subsurface sand layers were estimated. In the sea, at the waterline and in the middle of the beach higher numbers of bacteria, their biomass and secondary production were found in the surface (0-1 cm) than in the subsurface (5-10 cm) sand layers. A reverse situation was observed in the dune.																			1505-2249						2008	56	3					405	414																WOS:000259286800003

In aquatic mating species, vocalization is typically associated with breeding, including intraspecific agonistic behavior and mate attraction. Ringed seal (Pusa hispida) produces a diverse range of aquatic vocalizations. However, the connection between these vocalizations and reproductive behavior is unclear. The Saimaa ringed seal (P.h.saimensis) also produces a variety of underwater vocalizations, with knocking calls especially suggested to be connected to the breeding season. In this study, we used four passive hydrophones during two successive winters, deployed in the breeding habitat of ringed seals in Lake Saimaa, to further explore vocalization behavior. A total of 13,197 vocalization events were identified in the recordings. Only a single vocalization type was recorded and classified as quick knocks. We identified a strong temporal pattern, with vocal activity peaking in April. This peak coincides with the end of the nursing period when mating is assumed to occur. Based on this and earlier studies, we propose that this specific call type is emitted for mate attraction or defense of underwater mating territory. This study pinpoints the timing of the mating season of Saimaa, the ringed seal and provides further insight into the behavior of this endangered subspecies.

J	Chang, JC; Woodward, C; Shulmeister, J				Chang, Jie Christine; Woodward, Craig; Shulmeister, James			A snapshot of the limnology of eastern Australian water bodies spanning the tropics to Tasmania: the land-use, climate, limnology nexus	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The present study investigates 45 natural and artificial water bodies extending across the whole of eastern Australia from the tropics to Tasmania. A broad variety of physio-chemical, land-use and climatic parameters were measured. Reservoirs and other artificial water bodies responded to stressors in their catchments in a similar fashion to natural lakes, but tended to be less nutrient rich, possibly because of shorter residence times and active management. Salinity and pH were strongly correlated in the dataset. Bedrock had a strong influence on pH in freshwater lakes, whereas all highly saline lakes were alkaline, irrespective of bedrock. High concentrations of anions in saline lakes precluded the existence of acid conditions by binding available hydrogen ions. Almost all lakes fell on salinity axes that indicated marine origin for their salts. An assessment of the total nitrogen to total phosphorus molar ratios from the lakes in the present dataset indicated that productivity in Australian lakes could be limited by both nitrogen and phosphorus. Future research using macro-nutrient enrichment experiments should be pursued to confirm this preliminary observation. There was a strong positive correlation between regional aridity and lake eutrophication. This is typical of semi-arid and seasonally arid environments and reflects the concentration of nutrients owing to evaporative flux in shallow basins with high residence times.

To understand the ecological features of methanotrophs in association with plants in the methane emitting environments, we investigated the community composition and methane oxidation of methanotrophs associated with duckweeds in a fresh water lake. Duckweeds collected from Lake Biwa, Japan over three summers showed methane consumption activity between 0.0067 and 0.89 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) (wet weight), with the highest values occurring from the end of July to August. The methanotrophic community on duckweeds consisted primarily of gamma-proteobacterial groups including the genera Methylomonas and Methylocaldum. Further analysis of co-cultures of a methanotroph isolate with sterilized duckweed revealed that the duckweed plant as well as the duckweed spent culture supernatant exerted an enhancing effect on methane oxidation. These results indicate that duckweeds not only provide a habitat for methanotrophs but also stimulate methanotrophic growth. (C) 2019, The Society for Biotechnology, Japan. All rights reserved.

The results were, firstly, to show the Rhone entered in the thermocline, passed around the north shore of the lake by Coriolis's force, and it became clear that it reached the central level of the main basin called the "Grand Lac". Secondly, thanks to the detailed observations of CTD probe at 1m intervals, we found that Rhone inflow was divided into two or more depths, connected with the thermal staircases in the thermocline. There is a possibility that the Upper Rhone intrusion (cold and very turbid) causes double-diffusive convection.

Productivity decreased with increasing depth, and therefore, decreasing light intensity. Relations between productivity and chlorophyll a content, productivity and light intensity, phytoplankton productivity efficiency and light intensity, productivity and water temperature were investigated, as was the photosynthetic index.

Agassiz, 1865 invades the Fayum, Egypt	BIOINVASIONS RECORDS												In 2013, the invasive marine ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was first recorded in a true lake, Birket Qarun in the Fayum, Egyptian Desert. In 2014, it expanded in numbers and was also recorded in lake El Rayan II, south of Birket Qarun. Both lakes are saline, with Birket Qarun currently more concentrated than seawater. In the hot summer of 2015, a huge mortality was recorded, with only few larvae surviving. Whereas previous invasions were made possible by transportation in ship ballast water, trucks transporting mullet fry from aquaculture facilities in the Nile Delta to Birket Qarun and Lake Rayan II triggered the Fayum invasion. This is the first ever record of a ctenophore in an inland environment. We do not expect this invasion to be permanent, but it may damage the lake fisheries in the years ahead.																			2242-1300					MAR	2016	5	1					21	24		10.3391/bir.2016.5.1.04	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/bir.2016.5.1.04													WOS:000419952000004

Jannicke; Hobaek, Anders; Persson, Jonas; Skjelbred, Birger; Lovik, Jarl Eivind			Shifted dynamics of plankton communities in a restored lake: exploring the effects of climate change on phenology through four decades	CLIMATE RESEARCH												Lake surface temperatures have increased globally in recent decades. Climate change can affect lake biota directly via enhanced water temperatures, shorter ice cover duration and prolonged stratification, and indirectly via changes in species interactions. Changes in the seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton and zooplankton can further affect whole lake ecosystems. However, separating the effects of climate change from the more direct and dominating effects of nutrients is a challenge. Our aim was to explore the ecological effects of climate change while accounting for the effects of re-oligotrophication in Lake Mjosa, the largest lake in Norway. While restoration measures since the 1970s have resulted in strongly reduced nutrient levels, the surface water temperature has increased by almost 0.4 degrees C decade(-1) during the same period. We analysed long-term trends and abrupt changes in environmental and biological time series as well as changes in the seasonal dynamics of individual plankton taxa. The general long-term trends in phenology were diverging for phytoplankton (later peaks) vs. zooplankton (earlier peaks). However, individual taxa of both phytoplankton and zooplankton displayed earlier peaks. Earlier peaks of the phytoplankton group Cryptophyceae can be explained by increased spring temperature or other climate-related changes. Earlier onset of population growth of certain zooplankton species (Limnocalanus macrurus and Holopedium gibberum) can also be explained by climatic change, either directly (earlier temperature increase) or more indirectly (earlier availability of Cryptophyceae as a food source). In the long run, climate-related changes in both phytoplankton and zooplankton phenology may have implications for the fish communities of this lake.

Results from pooled material from the years 1987-1989 and 1996 (southern Finland, 11 populations) indicated that Anodonta piscinalis (n = 1,359) is the main host (total mean prevalence 71% and intensity +/- SE of infection 16.4 +/- 0.6). Pseudanodonta complanata (n = 106) was infected occasionally (3% and 1.3 +/- 0.3), whereas Unio pictorum (n = 108) and U. tumidus (n = 17) were not infected. Results from 17 A. piscinalis populations showed that P. rylovi occurs in southern Finland but not in northern Finland. In A. piscinalis, the mean intensity of infection was higher in lake populations than in river populations. Both host age and length had a negative relationship with the intensity of P. rylovi infection. Host sex did not affect the intensity of infection. Egg sacs of P. rylovi were found from June to August. There was a tendency for higher intensities of infection in autumn. Infection by the digenean Rhipidocotyle fennica had no effect on the intensity of P. rylovi infection.

This finding is relevant from the phycological, biogeographical and ecological points of view, and is the second world record of the species after one single known locality (Lake Manindjau, Sumatra, Malaysia), from which the species was collected and described around 130 years ago. The species was collected under summer base-flow conditions in four Mediterranean temporary/seasonal streams in 2018 and 2019. New information about the species' morphological characteristics and ecological preferences in the Iberian Peninsula is presented. A comparative description of the observed specimens with previously published data, some biogeographical aspects of findings, certain biological facets of the sponge-algal association, and its conservation status, are discussed.

Application of fast repetition rate fluorometry to phytoplankton photosynthetic parameters in freshwaters	PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH												Fast repetition rate fluorometry (FRRF) was successfully applied to various studies in modern oceanography. In this study, for the first time, the seasonality of phytoplankton photosynthetic parameters in a deep alpine lake was observed using FRRF in combination with the traditional C-14 incubation technique. Special attention was given to the differences in photosynthetic behaviour during mixed and stratified conditions, characterised especially during summer by a deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) dominated by the filamentous cyanobacterial species Planktothrix rubescens. Maximum light-utilisation efficiency (alpha*(14C)) was in the range of 0.01-0.03 mgC (mg Chl-a)(-1) h(-1)(mu mol phot. m(-2) s(-1))(-1), while maximum quantum yields for carbon fixation (Phi(C,max)) varied from 0.01-0.07 molC (mol phot.)(-1). Higher values occurred during thermal stratification indicating acclimation of the phytoplankton assemblage. These findings were supported by FRRF-based estimates, although cyanobacterial blooms could not be characterised by FRRF-excitation due to methodological deficiencies. In general, however, instantaneous photosynthetic rates measured by FRRF-excitation correlate well at sub-saturating light-intensities with conventional C-14-uptake rates, although they operate on different time-scales.					; Dokulil, Martin/J-3464-2019	Dokulil, Martin/0000-0002-6369-1457; 													0166-8595	1573-5079				APR	2006	88	1					19	30		10.1007/s11120-005-9018-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-005-9018-8								16847741					WOS:000238151800004

Sinter with different characteristics is distributed on the surface and in the fracture of moraine in Gangdise Glacial Period, or covered on different terraces (T-1-,T-5) and river bed of Changmaqu River. Based on geomorphic distribution and petrologic features, sinter can be divided into 6 suites. Suite 1 is travertine and the others are geyserite. At present, there is no better method to date for Quaternary sinter, especially geyserite. Before this paper, there are five ESR dates from Targiia geyserite. But we do not know fully about their geomorphic distribution of sampling sites. Two methods of U-series dating, bulk analysis of a whole-sample and total-sample-dissolution isochron techniques ( i. e., TSD scheme), are used in this paper. Chronologic explanation with geomorphic distribution is given as the following: Suite I is formed in late stage of interstade in the Last Glaciation of the late Late Pleistocene, i. e. MIS 3. Suite 2, the Penultimate Glacial Period of the late Middle Pleistocene, MIS 8 similar to 7. Suite 3, the Last Interglacial Period in the early Late Pleistocene, MIS 5. Suite 4, during the late stage of interstade of the Last Glaciation and the early stage of Last Glacial Maximum in the late Late Pleistocene, MIS 3 similar to 2. Suite 5, the Last Glacial Maximum of the late Late Pleistocene and the Postglacial period of the Holocene, MIS 2 similar to 1. Suite 6 is existing geyserite. Refering to ESR dates from other scientists, this paper thinks that the Targjia thermal sinter is formed in five stages: 403 similar to 202ka BP, about 99ka BP, 39 similar to 25ka BP, 17 similar to 4ka BP and the present. In the early period of stage 3, there was a activity of travertine.																			1000-0569	2095-8927				MAR	2006	22	3					717	724																WOS:000237332500021

Some of the most sensitive components of such ecosystems are the perched basins: small ponds and lakes that are hydraulically isolated from the main flow system. The biological structure and productivity of these basins are highly dependent on flooding and flushing associated with high stage events. Major flooding of the Peace-Athabasca Delta, one of the world's largest and most productive deltas, has not occurred since 1974, the time of the last major ice-jam event. Prior to this, the Delta also experienced an extensive drying period, from 1958-1971, as one of its main rivers became regulated. As a result, extensive changes have occurred in the vegetation regime and associated wildlife habitat. Recognizing the historical role of ice-jam flooding, attempts are being made to induce flooding through regulation of the natural flow system using ice. The changing hydroecology of this flood-dependent ecosystem, common approaches related to regulation effects and river ice covers, and the unique strategies used to construct artificial ice darns and/or initiate ice jams, are all reviewed.																			0886-9375					JUL-OCT	1996	12	4-5					447	457		10.1002/(SICI)1099-1646(199607)12:4/5<447::AID-RRR404>3.0.CO;2-Y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1099-1646(199607)12:4/5<447::AID-RRR404>3.0.CO;2-Y													WOS:A1996VK75500008
J	JONASSON, PM; THORHAUGE, F				JONASSON, PM; THORHAUGE, F			POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF POTAMOTHRIX-HAMMONIENSIS IN PROFUNDAL OF LAKE ESROM WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND COMPETITIVE FACTORS	OIKOS												P. hammoniensis (Michaelsen) (Tubificidae, Oligochaeta) forms a monoculture in the deeper profundal of Lake Esrom [Denmark]. In shallower profundal Psammoryctes barbatus Grube comprises about 5% of the tubificid population. Life cycle and population dynamics of P. hammoniensis are influenced by environmental and competitive factors. Density of mature specimens was greatest in the deep profundal. Variable length of stratification period (low O2 content) causes changes in growth, predation pressure and fluctuations in population size. Early autumn overturn in successive years resulted in lowered density due to increased predation. Predators are fish and carnivorous invertebrates. Anaerobic conditions reduced breeding activity and fecundity. High densities of Chironomus anthracinus (Zett.) decreased growth and fecundity of P. hammoniensis and delayed breeding until the worms were 4 yr old. Low densities of C. anthracinus resulted in high densities of P. hammoniensis which bred when 3 yr old. At shallower depths growth is faster, fecundity greater, the average new generation larger, greater mortality is compensated by higher fecundity and shorter life cycle. The shallow water population seems to be controlled mainly by predation and the deep water population by competition.																			0030-1299	1600-0706					1976	27	2					193	203		10.2307/3543898	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3543898													WOS:A1976BU82800002

In a five-month cultivation study, we aim to reduce various forms of nitrogen and phosphorus in the water-sediment system of eutrophic lakes amended with biochar/Effective Microorganisms (EMs) combined with different means. Self-organizing maps revealed that in the absence of exogenous contamination, the nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the water-sediment systems were greatly driven by the temporal variation in cultivation, followed by the depth of the water-sediment system and different amendments. The contents of nitrogen and phosphorus, especially NH3-N and SRP, in overlying- and pore-water gradually decreased with cultivated time and increased with depth due to the biological purification and the nutrient deposition. During summer months, the activity of biota promoted the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus, while the decomposition of phytoplankton released the more amounts of DOM (mg/L of DOC) left in water. Based on the temporal and depth variation of nutrients, the amended-groups impacted the overall levels of nitrogen and phosphorus through altering microbial activity and adjusting nutrient redistribution in the water-sediment systems. As an ideal carrier, biochar promoted microbial colonization and biofilm growth, while its-supported EMs improved the microbial activity of amended sediments. Thus, the application of biochar-supported EMs (BE) achieved the most desired repairs in removing nitrogen, phosphorus and DOM in water-sediment system and increasing their immobilization in sediment. The combination of biochar-supported EMs with aeration (BE.A) decreased the overall levels of nitrogen and DOM, but promoted the release of phosphorus in water due to its strong suspended particles' affinity. Additionally, BE.A and BE showed desirable resistance to highly-polluting wastewater inputs. This study provided practical theories for biochar-immobilized microbes to alleviate eutrophication and cycle of nutrients and DOM during summer months.

Considerable differences were recorded among reservoirs in their environmental parameters, zooplankton composition, species diversity and abundance. High abundance and dominance of rotifers as well as higher species diversity in the zooplankton were observed in more productive, eutrophic reservoirs Konde 1 and Konde 3 compared to the oligotrophic Spilje Reservoir characterised by prevalence of planktonic crustaceans. Dominant rotifer species in eutrophic reservoirs were Brachionus falcatzts, Brachionus angularis and Hexarthra mira; Spilje Reservoir was dominanted by Kellicottia longispina, a species characteristic for less productive waters. The significant correlation between trophic state index and rotifer abundance indicates that rotifers are useful biological indicators of water ecological status.

J	Scarabotti, PA; Demonte, LD; Pouilly, M				Scarabotti, Pablo A.; Danilo Demonte, L.; Pouilly, Marc			Climatic seasonality, hydrological variability, and geomorphology shape fish assemblage structure in a subtropical floodplain	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												We applied a multiscale approach to understand the patterns of longitudinal, lateral, and temporal variability in fish assemblage structure of a large floodplain river and explored their relationships with climatic seasonality, hydrological variability, and floodplain geomorphology. We studied the fish assemblage structure of 35 connected lakes along a 600-km section of the Parana River over 5 y. Longitudinal changes in fish assemblage structure were associated with a latitudinal climatic gradient, whereas temporal changes were associated with climatic seasonality and hydrological variability. Longitudinal and seasonal changes in assemblage structure were probably based on different thermal preferences of species that migrate seasonally along the main river axis. Extraordinary floods in summer promoted downstream dispersal of several species, which increased similarity between downstream and upstream regions. Thermal seasonality of this subtropical system was a strong factor driving temporal changes in assemblage structure, and the effects of the hydrological regime largely depended on flood pulses coincident with periods of warmer temperatures. Fish assemblages varied secondarily along a lateral gradient represented by types of geomorphic units distributed in the floodplain. The geomorphic units generated patchy environmental heterogeneity at the landscape scale that resulted in discontinuous patterns of fish assemblage structure. Assemblage composition was more similar among lakes belonging to similar geomorphic units but situated at geographically distant regions than among lakes belonging to different geomorphic units situated in the same region. Therefore, patterns in fish assemblage variation at regional and landscape scales appear to be determined largely by the dispersal and selection of suitable habitats by fish across the hierarchy of spatial and temporal scales.																			2161-9549	2161-9565				SEP	2017	36	3					653	668		10.1086/693441	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/693441													WOS:000407373600016

The measurements were made in autumn 1987 on Lake Ontario, using a rotatin microwave system mounted on a research tower operated by the Canada Centre for Inland Waters. The results show that at intermediate incidence angles the NRCS on the lake generally increases faster with wind speed than it does on the ocean. We attribute this to the larger atmospheric drag coefficients which exist on the lake compared with the ocean, and we show that the results are more consistent with a dependence of the NRCS on wind stress than on wind speed near the surface. We find a stratification dependence of the NRCS similar to that previously reported at C band and show that at 40 degrees and 60 degrees incidence angles this dependence can be removed by parameterizing the NRCS in terms of either the friction velocity or neutral wind speed. At a 20 degrees incidence angle the stratification dependence is not removed by this procedure.																			2169-9275	2169-9291				MAY 15	1995	100	C5					8791	8813		10.1029/95JC00364	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/95JC00364													WOS:A1995QY34500020

So far, the urban park ponds have been rarely studied (especially in Poland) in this respect. The analyses of the park ponds water in Zywiec were conducted during the vegetation season in 2016, in monthly intervals. The phytoplankton biomass was calculated by comparing the shape of algae to geometrical figures and based on the chlorophyll a concentrations. The chlorophyll a concentrations and values of the planktonic algae biomass remained at a low level. The species composition showed the dominance of diatoms (i. a. Achnanthes lanceolate (Brebisson ex Kutzing) Grun. in Cl. & Grun., Encyonema sp. (Kutzing) Krammer). The highest values of the planktonic algae biomass were observed in the summer season. The ponds in the Habsburgs Park in Zywiec have great aesthetic and recreational values and therefore more frequent monitoring is necessary.

J	Duigan, CA; Birks, HH				Duigan, CA; Birks, HH			The late-glacial and early-Holocene palaeoecology of cladoceran microfossil assemblages at Krakenes, western Norway, with a quantitative reconstruction of temperature changes	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Cladoceran microfossil remains were analysed from a sediment core taken from a lake basin at Krakenes, western Norway. The sequence included immediate post-glacial conditions (ca. 12,300 C-14 BP), the Allerod, Younger Dryas, and early Holocene to approximately 8,500 C-14 BP. The interpretation of changes in the cladoceran assemblages is based on the known ecology of the taxa, the documented environmental history of the study sequence, the variations in the organic content of the sediment, the radiocarbon dates, and the results of analyses of other biotic groups, including diatoms, macrophytes, and chironomids. In addition, a quantitative reconstruction of changes in air temperature is presented for the study period. This reconstruction is based on transfer functions developed from a separate Swiss surface-sediment cladoceran data set. The cladoceran assemblages throughout the sequence are dominated by littoral chydorid taxa. Bosmina, Daphnia, and Simocephalus represent the open-water component of the zooplankton. Chydorus piger and Daphnia were the only immediate post-glacial pioneer taxa. A rapid proliferation of the open-water and littoral cladoceran taxa began with the onset of the Allerod and persisted for approximately 1,000 yrs. At the start of the Younger Dryas a local glacier formed and drained into the lake, causing a sudden decline in chydorid diversity, with only Chydorus sphaericus and Acroperus harpae persisting throughout this period. Chydorid diversity started to recover in the upper Younger Dryas and continued in the early Holocene. Progressive acidification and oligotrophication are also discernible from the cladoceran assemblages present in the Holocene. The reconstructed mean summer air temperature was from 8-21 degrees C, with prediction errors of 1.8-2.5 degrees C. The Allerod was only slightly warmer than the Younger Dryas period, but a progressive increase in temperature is apparent during the early Holocene. In conclusion, the results of this study provide a further demonstration of the value of cladocera as indicators of a variety of palaeoenvironmental parameters, including temperature.

Data were obtained by microstratigraphical analysis of diatom frustules in the annually laminated sediment deposited at 17 m depth in the lake. On the basis of the recurring seasonal sequence of diatoms within most of the laminations, a successional, or ranking order of the taxa was obtained and 4 rank preference groups were identified: low-rank, mid-rank, high-rank and low- and high-rank taxa. Analyses of supra-annual population fluctuations, autocorrelation between the yearly abundances and specific year-to-year variability revealed notable differences in population dynamics. Pairwise correlation analysis between log-transformed yearly abundances produced a statistically significant aggregation of negative correlations between the low-rank taxa (the typical spring-maximum diatoms); positive correlations were significantly aggregated among the pairs with one low- and one high-rank taxon. Taxa with affinity to years with high diatom production, and others with apparent insensitivity to gross production fluctuations were identified by analysis of correlations between the yearly totals of plankton diatom production and the volumetric contribution of each taxon to the yearly totals.																			0030-1299	1600-0706					1984	43	1					30	40		10.2307/3544242	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3544242													WOS:A1984SR54400005

Amazonian aquatic systems comprise a dynamic mosaic of heterogeneous habits but are understudied and there is limited information about the mechanisms that shape bacterial community composition (BCC). There is a consensus that environmental selection (species sorting) and dispersal processes (source-sink dynamics) act in concert to shape the composition of these communities, but the relative importance of each mechanism may vary dramatically through time and between systems. Applying 16S rRNA gene amplicon high-throughput sequencing, we studied factors and processes that modulate BCC in an Amazonian floodplain lake and used source-tracking models to trace the main dispersal sources of microorganisms in the whole floodplain system during a full hydrological cycle. Our source-tracking models indicated that dispersal processes were predominant, explaining most of the BCC variability throughout the study period. We observed more sources contributing to the sink community during the falling water than rising water period, when contributions from the Solimes River dominated. There was a clear seasonal pattern in BCC, closely related to environmental variables, suggesting that the successful establishment of dispersing bacteria also depends on environmental filtering that is linked to water flow. In summary, source-sink dynamics and species sorting were strongly affected by water exchange and connectivity with the main river that varied throughout the flood pulse cycle. Our results demonstrated the influence of lateral transport and temporal dynamics on BCC in Amazonian floodplain lakes that could ultimately impact regional carbon budgets and biogeochemical cycles.					forsberg, bruce/AAE-4092-2020; Sarmento, Hugo/W-3805-2019; Sarmento, Hugo/A-7655-2008; Amaral, João Henrique/AAC-4315-2022; de Melo, Michaela/AAE-6608-2019; Barbosa, Pedro/KPA-6836-2024	Barbosa, Pedro/0000-0001-9858-964X; de Melo, Michaela/0000-0002-8545-4153; Sarmento, Hugo/0000-0001-5220-7992; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				JAN	2019	64	1					108	120		10.1111/fwb.13198	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13198													WOS:000453853500009

The diet compositions of specimens from two sites (A and B) on a river in Southern Brazil were compared according to the size of individuals and seasonal period. The collections were performed monthly from March 2005 to February 2006, where the stomach contents of 290 specimens were assessed. Food items for A. aff. fasciatus were basically composed of plants and insects, especially leaf fragments, seeds, fruits, filamentous algae, aquatic and terrestrial insects and insect fragments. At site A, the most common items were insect and plant fragments. Conversely at site B, plant fragments were more representative. In general, all items of animal origin showed the highest feeding index values at site A, whereas at site B detritus and grass items were more abundant. The composition of items varied seasonally, with higher diversity of items being recorded during the spring at both sites. Smaller individuals preferred items of animal origin, while the larger ones consumed mainly items of plant origin.

The park provides more than 2,000 feet of shoreline public access. The City expanded the marina in 2013 by installing a new breakwater and additional moorage facilities. The City had limited funds for the project and was looking for cost-effective measures to reduce overall project costs while increasing moorage opportunities. The existing marina was expanded by removing a section of existing breakwater and expanding the marina parallel to the shoreline. In order to reduce project costs, an innovative design was implemented that used horizontal steel sheet piling bolted to vertical steel H-piling and battered pipe piling for the vertical-wall breakwater. This innovative application of a common construction material reduced the overall construction costs significantly and expedited the construction schedule to allow the park to open in time for the summer season while providing the protection needed for the marina from the high wave exposure at the site.																					978-0-7844-7991-9				2016							333	342																WOS:000389434300034

When water resources management is systematically and efficiently managed, it produces clean water sources without pollution. Therefore, it is very essential to assess the water quality status for assuring the good quality of water to the consumer. The objective of the study is to identify the status of water quality index in the catchment ecosystem of UniSZA Lake, Terengganu. Six water sam-plings were carried out for each two weeks during dry season where six parameters were mea-sured and Malaysian Department of Environment-Water Quality Index (DOE-WQI) was calculated and classified based on the Interim National Water Quality Standards, Malaysia (INWQS). Results for chemicals parameters for dissolved oxygen range from 1.24 to 16.76 mg/L, biochem-ical oxygen demand range from 0.41 to 3.20 mg/L, chemical oxygen demand range from 18.67 to 111.33 mg/L, and ammoniacal nitrogen range from 0.05 to 10.03 mg/L. Results for physical parameters for total suspended solid range from 1.40 to 117.0 mg/L and pH range from 6.29 to 9.94. Overall, the WQI calculated for UniSZA Lake falls in Class II and Class III means that it is safe for recreational body contact and could support aquatic organism.

It is a perennially ice-covered, max. 169 m deep, ultra-oligotrophic lake. In contrast to earlier studies, we found clear evidence for physical and chemical stratification in the summer of 1991-92. However, the stratification was restricted to a trough, c. 500 m wide and up to 105 m deep, in the south-western part of the lake. There, the water body was distinctly stratified as indicated by sharp vertical gradients of temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and electrical conductivity. The water column was anoxic below 80 m. The chemical stratification is also indicated by changes of ionic ratios. Moreover, there was some evidence for methanogenesis and bacterial sulphate reduction in Lake Untersee.																			0954-1020					MAR	1997	9	1					43	45		10.1017/S0954102097000060	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954102097000060													WOS:A1997WM78000006

ANALYSIS OF ECOLOGICAL CONDITION OF THE NURA RIVER ACCORDING TO THE BASIC BIOGENIC ELEMENTS	NEWS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN-SERIES OF GEOLOGY AND TECHNICAL SCIENCES												The Nura River is an important water artery of Central Kazakhstan, feeding the network of lakes of the Korgalzhyn Nature Reserve, normal functioning of which depends on the quality of incoming Nura river waters, since the river flows through the territory of two regions undergoing technogenic and anthropogenic pollution. Assessment of quality of waters flowing into lakes is an important element in monitoring studies. The article assesses the ecological state of the Nura River by biogenic elements in three observation points - the village of Romanovka, the village of Sabyndy, the village of Korgalzhyn during the period from 2015 to 2018. An analysis of the dynamics of receipt of basic biogenic elements, such as ammonium salt, nitrite nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, and phosphates was carried out. The results of the analysis indicate pollution of the river in all the investigated points with ammonium salts and nitrite nitrogen. The content of nitrate nitrogen and phosphates does not exceed the maximum permissible concentrations (MPCs). The main source of pollution can probably be nearby settlements, the main activity of which is related to agriculture. The main periods of pollution are the summer seasons in all years. The investigated points on the degree of pollution belong to a moderate level of pollution.					; Abileva, Gulmira/AAU-4651-2020	Omarbaeva, Ainur/0000-0002-1308-9740; Abileva, Gulmira/0000-0003-3398-1477; Zhamangara, Aizhan/0000-0002-2348-1711; Zhapparova, Bazargul/0000-0002-7591-2667; Szoszkiewicz, Krzysztof/0000-0002-8196-333X													2224-5278	2518-170X				SEP-OCT	2019		5					237	243		10.32014/2019.2518-170X.148	http://dx.doi.org/10.32014/2019.2518-170X.148													WOS:000504062100029

Sediment and particulate organic carbon budgets of a subarctic estuarine fjard: Lake Melville, Labrador	MARINE GEOLOGY												Sediment and particulate organic carbon (POC) budgets constructed for oceanic regions provide a means to quantify the burial of POC, providing a baseline against which future change can be measured. Here we developed the first mass balance budgets of sediment and POC (terrestrial and marine) for the Lake Melville system (LMS; Goose Bay and Lake Melville) in central Labrador using previously published data (Pb-210-based mass accumulation rates, river discharge, and total suspended solids) together with measurements of %OC and delta C-13 signatures within dated sediment cores collected from the LMS basins and water from main tributaries and Groswater Bay. A two end-member mixing model was used to establish fractions of terrigenous and marine POC. Overall, our mass balance budgets show that the Churchill River is the major supply of sediment (16.7 +/- 7.8 x 10(8) kg y(-1)) and POCterr (18.4 +/- 6.6 x 10(6) kg y(-1)) to the LMS, accounting for 47% and 56% of the total input to the system, respectively. Although the Churchill River drains directly into Goose Bay along with the smaller Goose River, the majority of sediment (12.9 +/- 7.8 x 10(8) kg y(-1)) and POCterr (11.8 +/- 7.0 x 10(6) kg y(-1)) is transported eastward through the surface water plume into Lake Melville. Inputs of POCmar from autochthonous primary production, estimated by applying an empirical relationship between sediment-surface flux of POCmar and water depth, to Goose Bay (1.8 x 10(6) kg y(-1)) and Lake Melville (98.3 +/- 4.7 x 10(6) kg y(-1)) increase with increasing distance from the Churchill River. To investigate the potential changes to the sediment load of the Churchill River to the LMS following impoundment at Muskrat Falls, we calculated the sediment increase using the median reservoir shoreline erosion potential. This approach showed that the delivery of sediment and POCterr to the LMS by the Churchill River may double during the two years following impoundment of the lower Churchill River.					; Macdonald, Robie/A-7896-2012	Macdonald, Robie/0000-0002-1141-8520; 													0025-3227	1872-6151				JUN	2020	424								106154	10.1016/j.margeo.2020.106154	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.margeo.2020.106154													WOS:000535718600013
J	Norstedt, G; Östlund, L				Norstedt, Gudrun; Ostlund, Lars			Fish or Reindeer? The Relation between Subsistence Patterns and Settlement Patterns among the Forest Sami	ARCTIC ANTHROPOLOGY												The subsistence patterns of the Sami of northern Fennoscandia in early modern times are poorly understood. In this study, we use a map from AD 1671 of a Swedish forest-Sami district in order to explore the subject. The map includes 38 summer settlement symbols, all placed close to rivers and lakes. We compare this settlement pattern with ethnographic descriptions of forest-Sami groups and find that it is consistent with a fish-centered subsistence pattern but not with a reindeer-centered one. In literature, the Sami of Sweden are generally said to have transitioned from a hunting economy to reindeer pastoralism, while fishing has been seen as a supplementary subsistence mode. Since fishers tend to differ from hunters and herders in terms of social organization and sedentism, it is important to consider the possibility of a fish-centered subsistence pattern when discussing arctic and subarctic societies.

Although the outcrops of jade are located far away, the material was widely used. Green jade was employed for making tools, whereas ornaments were made of white or light-colored jade. The choice was motivated by durability, color, translucency, and rarity. Binocular microscopy was used to reconstruct manufacturing technologies. Most artifacts belong to the Glazkovo culture. Calibrated radiocarbon dates of burials with jade items, corrected for the reservoir effect, fall within the 4597-3726 BP interval.

Spatiotemporal Snowfall Trends in Central New York	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Central New York State, located at the intersection of the northeastern United States and the Great Lakes basin, is impacted by snowfall produced by lake-effect and non-lake-effect snowstorms. The purpose of this study is to determine the spatiotemporal patterns of snowfall in central New York and their possible underlying causes. Ninety-three Cooperative Observer Program stations are used in this study. Spatiotemporal patterns are analyzed using simple linear regressions, Pearson correlations, principal component analysis to identify regional clustering, and spatial snowfall distribution maps in the ArcGIS software. There are three key findings. First, when the long-term snowfall trend (1931/32-2011/12) is divided into two halves, a strong increase is present during the first half (1931/32-1971/72), followed by a lesser decrease in the second half (1971/72-2011/12). This result suggests that snowfall trends behave nonlinearly over the period of record. Second, central New York spatial snowfall patterns are similar to those for the whole Great Lakes basin. For example, for five distinct regions identified within central New York, regions closer to and leeward of Lake Ontario experience higher snowfall trends than regions farther away and not leeward of the lake. Third, as compared with precipitation totals (0.02), average air temperatures had the largest significant (p < 0.05) correlation (-0.56) with seasonal snowfall totals in central New York. Findings from this study are valuable because they provide a basis for understanding snowfall patterns in a region that is affected by both non-lake-effect and lake-effect snowstorms.																			1558-8424	1558-8432				DEC	2014	53	12					2685	2697		10.1175/JAMC-D-14-0084.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-14-0084.1													WOS:000346284300004

Since then the species has expanded from a solely littoral habitat in Upper Lake Constance, but now makes seasonal migrations into the pelagic zone. This behavioral change has been accompanied by a drastic increase in stickleback abundance. In order to integrate information about feeding of sticklebacks in Upper Lake Constance over two consecutive years, stomach content analysis was combined with seasonal stable isotope analysis on two types of tissue (muscle and liver). Isotope values were also obtained for zooplankton, whitefish larvae and eggs. We calculated the contribution of potential food sources for sticklebacks' diet using a Bayesian mixing model (SIMMR). Furthermore, we determined stickleback trophic position, and delta N-15 and delta C-13 values were compared with those of other fish species of Lake Constance. The results of the Bayesian model as well as the stomach content analysis showed clear evidence of stickleback predation on fish eggs and larvae. Stickleback delta N-15 values were elevated during winter and comparable to those of piscivorous pike, while delta N-15 values of zooplankton were reduced, and those of whitefish larvae were similar to those of sticklebacks after accounting trophic fractionation of N isotopes. Trophic position calculations further identified sticklebacks as piscivorous, while the delta C-13 values of the liver and stomach content analysis suggests that a benthic-pelagic species pair may exist in Lake Constance. These findings support the hypotheses that sticklebacks in Lake Constance can display piscivorous feeding behaviour on sympatric fish species, most likely whitefish larvae and eggs.

A slight reduction in number of taxa present occurred below pH 6, with the fauna below 3 m dominated by the Diptera. Although epibenthic gastropods were rare, in contrast with European studies, Amphipoda, Ephemeroptera and Pisidium were common in the least buffered lake, which experiences spring pH values as low as 4.7. There were little relation between the pH or alkalinity, and the abundance, and biomass of the fauna at depths greater than 3 m. However, biomass of the littoral fauna increased significantly in the lakes with lower pH, as a result of an increase in large littoral species normally susceptible to fish predation.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1985	128	1					31	38		10.1007/BF00008937	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008937													WOS:A1985ASS9300004

Environmental and climatic changes in central Chilean Patagonia since the Late Glacial (Mallin El Embudo, 44° S)	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Multi-millennial environmental and climatic changes in central Chilean Patagonia (44-49 degrees S) during the Last Glacial-Interglacial cycle have been of particular interest as changes in the position and strength of the southern westerlies are the major forcing factor conditioning the environmental dynamics. Recent attempts to reconstruct regional environmental and climatic signals from central Chilean Patagonia reveal some discrepancies and unclear issues among the records. This paper presents the 13 ka pollen and charcoal records from Mallin El Embudo (44 degrees 40'S, 71 degrees 42'W) located in the deciduous Nothofagus forest in the middle Rio Cisnes valley. The paper aims to (1) establish the timing and magnitude of local vegetation changes and fire activity since the Late Glacial and (2) integrate these results at the regional scale in order to discuss the discrepancies and depict the environmental and climatic dynamics in central Chilean Patagonia since the Late Glacial. Open landscapes dominated by grasses associated with scattered Nothofagus forest patches dominated the middle Rio Cisnes valley between 13 and 11.2 ka suggesting low effective moisture but also indicating that landscape configuration after glacial retreat was still ongoing. At 11.2 ka, the sudden development of an open and quite dynamic Nothofagus forest probably associated with the synchronous high fire activity occurred, suggesting a rise in effective moisture associated with dry summers. Since 9.5 ka, the record reflects the presence of a closed Nothofagus forest related to higher effective moisture conditions than before combined with moderate dry summers that may have triggered a high frequency of low-magnitude crown fires that did not severely affect the forest. The forest experienced a slight canopy opening after 5.7 ka, probably due to slightly drier conditions than before followed by a sudden change to open forest conditions around 4.2 ka associated with fire and volcanic disturbances. Around 2 ka, the recovery of a closed Nothofagus forest related to slightly wetter conditions (similar to present) occurred and persisted under highly variable climatic conditions up to 0.1 ka when massive forest burning and logging due to European settlements occurred. Central Chilean Patagonian climatic and environmental changes at millennial-centennial timescales since the Late Glacial were driven by changes in the southern westerlies latitudinal position and/or intensity, but during the late Holocene fire, volcanism and humans arose as forces contributing to environmental dynamics.

Chlorophyll a concentration is low (0.2-0.4 mug-l-1) and there is no discernable spring increase. The phytoplankton is largely dominated by flagellates. Bacterioplankton exhibits a seasonal pattern of abundance ranging from 1.0 x 10(8).l-1 in July to 3.25 x 10(8).l-1 in September. Changes in bacterial abundance probably relate to temperature and grazing by heterotrophic and mixotrophic flagellates. Total flagellated protozoan concentrations ranged between 25-136 x 10(2).l-1. Autotrophic and heterotrophic flagellate abundances were coupled and peaks in their abundance oscillated with peaks in bacterioplankton concentration. Four species of ciliated protozoa, dominated by oligotrichs, particularly the plastidic Strombidium, inhabit the lake. The plankton is characterised by the presence of flocs which act as loci for bacteria, flagellates and amoebae and feeding sites for the ciliates and the two sparce metazoan components of the plankton. Crooked Lake is extremely oligotrophic but nonetheless supports a plankton community with a low species diversity and simple trophodynamics.																			0722-4060					SEP	1992	12	3-4					411	416																WOS:A1992JP99800009
J	Basaula, R; Sharma, HP; Paudel, BR; Kunwar, PS; Sapkota, K				Basaula, Rajendra; Sharma, Hari Prasad; Paudel, Babu Ram; Kunwar, Prabesh Singh; Sapkota, Kumar			Effects of invasive water hyacinth on fish diversity and abundance in the Lake Cluster of Pokhara Valley, Nepal	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Water hyacinth (Pontederia crassipes) invasion is a growing global issue which poses a threat to aquatic life. As in the global context, the water hyacinth invasion is increasing rapidly in the lakes of Pokhara valley which is listed in Ramsar sites. Its effect on aquatic life is little known. This study examined the effects of water hyacinth invasion on the diversity and abundance of fishes in lakes of Pokhara Valley. We estimated the seasonal fish diversity and abundance in water hya-cinth presence (HP) and absence (HA) habitats between 2019 and 2020. The study found that water hyacinth invasion has a negative impact on fish diversity and abundance in the lakes of Pokhara Valley. Twenty fish species were recorded, with family Cyprinidae being the most abundant. Fish abundance was higher in the winter season and in habitats with water hyacinth presence. The invasive Oreochromis niloticus was the most abundant fish in both habitats, but more so in habitats with water hyacinth presence. The exotic fish species Ctenopharyngodon idella had greater abundance in habitats with water hyacinth presence while Ciprinus carpio had greater abundance in habitats without water hyacinth. Exotic fish species abundance was positively correlated with water hyacinth coverage. The findings suggest that water hyacinth invasion negatively impacts native fish species, with the diversity of native species being low in habitats with water hyacinth presence. The study recommends regular stock enhancement programs for native fish species, control and management of invasive weeds, and further study to support the conservation of native fisheries resources and the livelihood of the fishery-dependent community.

J	Hardiman, JM; Johnson, BM; Martinez, PJ				Hardiman, JM; Johnson, BM; Martinez, PJ			Do predators influence the distribution of age-0 kokanee in a Colorado reservoir?	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Seasonal changes in reservoir conditions such as productivity, light, and temperature create spatiotemporal variation in habitat that may segregate or aggregate predators and prey, producing implications for the distribution, growth, and survival of fishes. We used hydroacoustics to document the diel vertical distribution of age-0 kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka relative to environmental gradients at Blue Mesa Reservoir, Colorado, during May-August of 2002. Temperature, light, and zooplankton density profiles were examined relative to foraging conditions for kokanee and their primary predator, lake trout Salvelinus namaycush. Age-0 kokanee displayed large diel vertical migrations in May despite the lack of an energetic advantage before reservoir stratification. Age-0 kokanee minimized near-surface foraging at this time, perhaps to avoid predation by visual predators, such as lake trout, in the well-fit surface waters. Strong reservoir stratification in midsummer appeared to provide a thermal refuge from lake trout that the kokanee exploited. By August vertical migrations were shallow and most kokanee remained in the epilimnion throughout the day. Although the energetic implications of the late-summer strategy are unclear, it appears that kokanee were responding to changes in their predator environment. A robust model for kokanee diel vertical migration across a range of systems should include a predator avoidance component.																			0002-8487					NOV	2004	133	6					1366	1378		10.1577/T03-1234.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T03-1234.1													WOS:000224970100006

Ongoing archaeological work in the area provides an opportunity to link palaeoenvironmental and archaeological data to improve our understanding of human adaptations to dryland environmental change. A combination of stable isotope analysis, mineral magnetic analysis, an investigation of the particle size distributions and uranium-thorium dating, together with supporting image processing of remotely sensed data, indicates a trend of falling groundwater level since the late Pleistocene, manifested by former lakes, swamps and springlines. Archaeological evidence shows how human activity has adapted to these environmental changes.

Corresponding long-term shifts in stream temperature and invasive fish migration	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												By investigating historic trapping records of invasive sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) throughout tributaries to the Laurentian Great Lakes, we found that upstream spawning migration timing was highly correlated with stream temperatures over large spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, several streams in our study exceeded a critical spring thermal threshold (i.e., 15 degrees C) and experienced peak spawning migration up to 30 days earlier than in the 1980s, whereas others were relatively unchanged. Streams exhibiting warming trends and earlier migration were spatially clustered and generally found on the leeward side of the Great Lakes where the lakes most affect local climate. These findings highlight that all streams are not equally impacted by climate change and represent, to our knowledge, the first observation linking long-term changes in stream temperatures to shifts in migration timing of an invasive fish. Earlier sea lamprey migration in Great Lakes tributaries may improve young of the year growth and survival but not limit their spatial distribution, making sea lamprey control more challenging.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAY	2018	75	5					772	778		10.1139/cjfas-2017-0195	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2017-0195													WOS:000430798800011

SUSPENDED LOAD IN THE AKTRU RIVER AND PECULIARITIES OF ITS REGIME OVER THE LAST 50 YEARS	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL												Mountain rivers with glacier-derived nourishment bring an appreciable quantity of water-borne dust - stream load. The principal supplier of fragmentary materials is glaciers. The glacier attrites the foot of massive materials to the smallest rates - less than a thousandth of a millimeter. At the same time the stream load has larger items - river gravel and granule round stone. However, despite a significant mountain rivers' turbidity regular water observation of this phenomenon is not realized in every region of our country. Water observation was realized at the hydrometeostation Aktru for a month by a standard instrument - the bathometer. Water measurement was made at the same time. The records of water measurement were fixed by the logger Valdai. The water rate was obtained daily by a hydrometric current meter for the period of 14 to 23 of July. Diurnal variations of water depend on the solar altitude - the max is at 2.00-4.00 p.m. when the sun is at zenith. At this time the bulk of water reaches the section line of the measurements. The min of the water level is at 8 a.m. At night the ablation reduces to a minimum. The water level decreases. The abrupt jump of turbidity on July 14, 2012 is considered separately. On this day at 4 p.m. the turbidity of 27500 g/m(3) was registered. For reference, in 1962 the max level of turbidity was 6820 g/m(3), in 1958 - 1560 g/m(3), in 1957 - 1487 g/m(3). Yet, I.M. Kolushkina, V.V. Vasilyev, I.K. Kovalev marked that the 1962 turbidity was anomalously high. It happened because of the extended rain period on July 13-14. At the same time earth falls and mudflows moved down from the flanks of the mountain the dome of the three lakes. The max turbidity of glacial origin was 5181 g/m(3). The flood of the airborne hirst of 2012 with 16.4 kg/s is greater than that of 1962 with 8.99 kg/s. The max of water turbidity was on July 14, 2012 with 357 kg/s. The measurements were made in the upper zone of the Aktru River at different times of the day. Altogether, the max turbidity of the Small Aktru in 2012 was 1824 g/m(3) in 1962 it was 4582 g/m(3) on August 1. Another part of observations in 2012 was sediment gradation analysis. The selection of samples was realized at the different levels of spring flood including but not limited to July 14. The results of the grain-size analysis indicate that sediments are mainly (30% to 60%) composed of particles with the size of 0.5 to 0.1 mm. The composition of the sediments of July 14 is different. The particles are 0.1-0.05 mm.																			1561-7793	1561-803X				APR	2014		381					226	231		10.17223/15617793/381/37	http://dx.doi.org/10.17223/15617793/381/37													WOS:000420993400037

To address this issue, we reconstructed a multiproxy-based Holocene climate history from the sediments of Kanas Lake and neighboring Tiewaike Lake in the southern Altai Mountains. The results show an exceptionally warm climate during similar to 6.5-3.6 kyr is indicated by the silicon isotope composition of diatom silica (delta Si-30(diatom)) and the biogenic silica (BSi) content. During 4.7-4.3 kyr, a peak in delta Si-30(diatom) reflects enhanced lake thermal stratification and periodic nutrient limitation as indicated by concomitant decreasing BSi content. Our geochemical results indicate a significantly warm and wet climate in the Altai Mountain region during 6.5-3.6 kyr, corresponding to the Altai Holocene Climatic Optimum (AHCO), which is critical for promoting prehistoric human population expansion and intensified cultural exchanges across the Central Asian steppe during the Bronze Age. The impact of climate change on Holocene human activity in the Altai-Sayan region of Central Asia is unclear. Here, the authors use pollen, biogenic silica, and isotope records from lake cores to show that the climate prompted human population expansion and intensified cultural exchange during the Bronze Age.

Val; Guo, Laodong			Spatiotemporal variations in the abundance and composition of bulk and chromophoric dissolved organicmatter in seasonally hypoxia-influenced Green Bay, Lake Michigan, USA	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Green Bay, Lake Michigan, USA, is the largest freshwater estuary in the Laurentian Great Lakes and receives disproportional terrestrial inputs as a result of a high watershed to bay surface area ratio. While seasonal hypoxia and the formation of "dead zones" in Green Bay have received increasing attention, there are no systematic studies on the dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and its linkage to the development of hypoxia. During summer 2014, bulk dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analysis, UV-vis spectroscopy, and fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) coupled with PARAFAC analysis were used to quantify the abundance, composition and source of DOM and their spatiotemporal variations in Green Bay, Lake Michigan. Concentrations of DOC ranged from 202 to 571 mu M-C (average = 361 +/- 73 mu M-C) in June and from 279 to 610 mu M-C (average = 349 +/- 64 mu M-C) in August. In both months, absorption coefficient at 254 nm (a(254)) was strongly correlated to bulk DOC and was most abundant in the Fox River, attesting a dominant terrestrial input. Non-chromophoric DOC comprised, on average, similar to 32% of bulk DOC in June with higher terrestrial DOM and similar to 47% in August with higher aquagenic DOM, indicating that autochthonous and more degraded DOM is of lower optical activity. PARAFAC modeling on EEM data resulted in four major fluorescent DOM components, including two terrestrial humic-like, one aquagenic humic-like, and one protein-like component. Variations in the abundance of DOM components further supported changes in DOM sources. Mixing behavior of DOM components also indicated that while bulk DOM behaved quasi-conservatively, significant compositional changes occurred during transport from the Fox River to the open bay.

A multi-proxy reconstruction of climate during the late-Pleistocene to early Holocene transition in the northeastern, USA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												A multiproxy record from Twin Ponds, VT, is used to reconstruct climatic variability during the late Pleistocene to early Holocene transition. Pollen, ostracodes, delta O-18, and lithologic records from 13.5 to 9.0 cal ka BP are presented. Pollen- and ostracode-inferred climatic reconstructions are based on individual species' environmental preferences and the modern analog technique. Principal components analysis of all proxies highlights the overall warming trend and centennial-scale climatic variability. During the Younger Dryas cooling event (YD), multiple proxies show evidence for cold winter conditions and increasing seasonality after 12.5 cal ka BP. The early Holocene shows an initial phase of rapid warming with a brief cold interval at 11.5 cal ka BP, followed by a more gradual warming; a cool, wet period from 11.2 to 10.8 cal ka BP; and cool, dry conditions from 10.8 to 10.2 cal ka BP. The record ends with steady warming and increasing moisture. Post-YD climatic variability has been observed at other sites in the northeastern United States and points to continued instability in the North Atlantic during the final phases of deglaciation.

However, groundwater studies are quite hard and complex for many regions besides consuming time and cost. This study focused on the groundwater potential mapping in Beysehir Lake Basin. Mainly, fuzzy-analytic hierarchy process (fuzzy-AHP) integrated with GIS was used to determine potential zones for groundwater. Seven parameters, namely lithology, lineament, drainage density, land use, slope, soil type, and rainfall were evaluated and Groundwater Potential Index (GWPI) was calculated using weight and rating coefficients of each parameter. According to obtained results, GWPI varies from 0.07665 to 0.28243 in the basin. The low, moderate, and high groundwater potential classes were determined with quantile classification method. The groundwater potential map demonstrates that the high groundwater potential area is located around the lake shore, in the alluvium and limestone fields because high permeability rates depend on soil type, low slope, karstic structure, and agricultural activities in these regions. In addition, the distribution of the springs confirms with groundwater potential area determined with this study.

In this study we want to identify the most suitable habitat and organisms for comparisons. For this, we needed to study the effects of seasonality, habitat variability and diversity. Therefore, we studied the benthic meiofaunal communities in the sediment and hard substrates of Lake Ohrid's littoral and profundal sediments as well as littoral rotifers collected monthly and seasonally between 2000 and 2010. Our results showed that, among the over two million meiobenthic organisms per square meter, nematodes dominated the profundal (mean proportion: 91%) and littoral (mean proportion: 87%) sediments; whereas, rotifers were the most abundant group in littoral periphyton (mean proportion: 64%). The community composition was very typical of each habitat-type, homogeneous in the profundal and more heterogenous in the littoral. Rotifer communities were only significantly less diverse and abundant in winter. Thus, a comparison of ancient lake nematodes living in the deep profundal is potentially quite valuable. However, littoral communities are less stable in terms of seasonality and heterogeneity. (C) 2020 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Wu, BB; Wang, GQ; Jiang, H; Wang, JF; Liu, CM				Wu, Binbin; Wang, Guoqiang; Jiang, Hong; Wang, Jingfu; Liu, Changming			Impact of revised thermal stability on pollutant transport time in a deep reservoir	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Thermal stability (Schmidt stability) and water age, which are significantly related to water quality and algae bloom in deep reservoirs, are two crucial indicators of stratification strength and pollutant transport time, respectively. Here, the original Schmidt stability, which was derived from a one-dimensional assumption, was theoretically extended to a three-dimensional water body. In addition, a three-dimensional model was verified for the case study of Hongfeng Reservoir in China based on data from 2009 and 2010. Although the revised stability was similar to the original stability of Hongfeng Reservoir, which occurred at a relatively low level, the greater stratification in other deep water bodies would enhance their difference. Air temperature and water depth were the most important factors of the temporal variation in stability and the spatial variation in stability, respectively. The pollutant transport processes in the Hongfeng Reservoir was very complex with alternate appearances of overflow, interflow and underflow, depending on the season. The spatial water age was primarily determined by the morphometry and the inflow/outflow (with the highest water age in North Lake), whereas the vertical difference in the water age among the layers was primarily controlled by thermal stratification. Negative linear relationships between the average stability and the water ages of the bottom layers in three representative sites during summer were observed. Positive linear relationships between the average stability and the water ages of the surface layers were also observed. These findings enable a better understanding of the hydrodynamic and pollutant transport processes in a deep reservoir. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Simulation of the Holocene climate evolution in Northern Africa: The termination of the African Humid Period	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					32nd International Geological Congress	AUG 20-28, 2004	Florence, ITALY					The Holocene climate evolution in Northern Africa is studied in a 9000-yr-long transient simulation with a coupled atmosphere-ocean-vegetation model forced by changes in insolation and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. The model simulates in the monsoonal domains a significant decrease in precipitation under influence of the orbitally forced reduction in summer insolation. In the Western Sahara region, the simulated mid-Holocene transition from humid to arid conditions (the termination of the African Humid Period) is highly non-linear with the occurrence of centennial-scale climate fluctuations due to the biogeophysical feedback between precipitation and vegetation cover. This result is in agreement with proxy data from the Western Sahara region. The other monsoonal regions experience a more gradual climate evolution that linearly follows the insolation forcing, which appears in disagreement with available lake level records.

The Pivotal Role of Evaporation in Lake Water Isotopic Variability Across Space and Time in a High Arctic Periglacial Landscape	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Rapidly changing climate is disrupting the High Arctic's water systems. As tracers of hydrological processes, stable water isotopes can be used for high quality monitoring of Arctic waters to better reconstruct past changes and assess future environmental threats. However, logistical challenges typically limit the length and scope of isotopic monitoring in High Arctic landscapes. Here, we present a comprehensive isotopic survey of 535 water samples taken in 2018 and 2019 of the lakes and other surface waters of the periglacial Pituffik Peninsula in far northwest Greenland. The delta 18O, delta 2H, and deuterium-excess values of these samples, representing 196 unique sites, grant unprecedented insight into the environmental drivers of the regional hydrology and water isotopic variability. We find that the spatial variability of lake water isotopes can best be explained through evaporation and the hydrological ability of a lake to replace evaporative water losses with precipitation and snowmelt. Temporally, summer-long evaporation can drive lake water isotopes beyond the isotopic range observed in precipitation, and wide interannual changes in lake water isotopes reflect annual weather differences that influenced evaporation. Following this, water isotope samples taken at individual times or sites in similar periglacial landscapes may have limited regional representativeness, and increasing the spatiotemporal extent of isotopic sampling is critical to producing accurate and informative High Arctic paleoclimate reconstructions. Overall, our survey highlights the diversity of isotopic compositions in Pituffik surface waters, and our complete isotopic and geospatial database provides a strong foundation for future researchers to study hydrological changes at Pituffik and across the Arctic. Water isotopes can help us track how rapidly changing climate is disrupting High Arctic water systems, but the challenging Arctic environment has limited the monitoring required to understand these isotopes. To address this, we collected 535 water isotope samples from lakes and other waters on the Pituffik Peninsula in northwest Greenland in 2018 and 2019. We found that differences in lake water isotopes are mainly due to water evaporation and how connected a lake is to sources of precipitation and snowmelt that can replace evaporated water in the summer. The information we collected about isotopes is a good starting point for other scientists who want to study how water is changing, not just in Pituffik, but also in the whole Arctic. Our findings tell us that if we only collect water samples once or twice, or only in one place, we might not get the full picture of what is happening with the isotopes across the whole region. To get a better understanding of how the climate is changing in the High Arctic, water isotopic samples should be collected from a wide range of locations over long periods of time. Five hundred and thirty five water isotope samples taken over 2 years in Pituffik, Greenland, provide insight into High Arctic isotope hydrology Spatially, lake water isotopic composition reflects the degree that evaporation losses are offset by precipitation and snowmelt recharge Evaporation drives summer-long lake water isotopic evolution and best explains interannual isotopic differences					Welker, Jeffrey/C-9493-2013; Kopec, Ben/ABH-9846-2020; Bailey, Hannah/AAN-9643-2021; Akers, Pete/J-7590-2017	Akers, Pete D./0000-0002-2266-5551; Bailey, Hannah/0000-0002-8913-8473; Kopec, Ben/0000-0002-6249-9156													0043-1397	1944-7973				OCT	2024	60	10							e2023WR036121	10.1029/2023WR036121	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023WR036121													WOS:001334208400001

The Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) arrived in Lake Ontario (USA/Canada) about 20 years ago with a documented history of annual offshore-inshore migrations in its native range. Here we combined nearshore, fixed-plot video with offshore trawl data to document the annual migration of this population over multiple years. This behaviour was correlated with seasonal, nearshore temperature changes. The population size structure and mean fish length of returning fish were smaller than those of out-migrating fish. The out-migrating population contained an estimated 37.7 metric tonnes of phosphorous; and we estimated roughly 20 metric tonnes were translocated to and remained in offshore waters over the winter months, representing an important nutrient subsidy to a variety of offshore piscivorous fish. Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) have incorporated Round Goby extensively into their diet and consume a size range of fish matching the size range of missing Round Goby that fail to return to the nearshore. We conclude Round Goby are an important prey within the food web of Lake Ontario and translocate roughly 6.5% of the monthly total phosphorous load entering from surface waters. Further investigations of the nutrient content, population size structure and fate of migrating Round Goby in Lake Ontario are warranted to clarify the extent of this prey and nutrient subsidy in ongoing assessments of lake condition.					; Weidel, Brian/LFR-6469-2024	Mehler, Knut/0000-0003-1302-3343; Bruestle, Eric/0000-0002-3637-8764; pennuto, christopher/0000-0002-0584-4005													0906-6691	1600-0633				APR	2021	30	2					151	161		10.1111/eff.12568	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12568		FEB 2021											WOS:000616729400001

To test the hypothesis that partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and CO2 evasion vary throughout a day due to biological processes driven by solar radiation, we conducted in-situ pCO(2) and ambient water measurements over eleven 10-h periods in a subtropical, eutrophic shallow lake from November 2017 to May 2018. In-situ measurements were performed at 7:00, 10:00, 14:00, and 17:00 Central Standard Time of the United States (CST), and CO2 evasion rates were estimated based on the field pCO(2) records. Strong daily declining trends of pCO(2) and CO2 flux were found throughout the seasons except for one winter day with unusually low temperatures. At 7:00, 10:00, 14:00, and 17:00 CST of a day, average pCO(2) were 1131, 839, 345 and 205 mu atm, respectively, while average CO2 fluxes were 80, 67, -10, and -34 mmol m(2) h(-1). Significant differences were found in average pCO(2) between any two measured time points in a day, while significant reductions in CO2 flux were observed between 10:00 and 14:00 CST and between 14:00 and 17:00 CST. pCO(2) and CO2 flux dynamics were most likely driven by the air-water exchanges during nighttime hours and mainly driven by aquatic metabolism in the daytime. These findings suggest possible large uncertainties in the estimation of carbon emitted from trophic lakes, highlighting the need for further research on diurnal pCO(2) fluctuation from different aquatic ecosystems to improve CO2 evasion estimation.					; Xu, Y./A-7681-2014	Xu, Zhen/0000-0003-4269-4226; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				MAR	2019	570						486	494		10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.01.016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.01.016													WOS:000460709400040

Here, we demonstrate its application to model structure identification, by ranking the constituent hypotheses and identifying the critical elements for progressive revision of the model. Our case study is Lake Oglethorpe - a small monomictic impoundment in South-eastern Georgia, USA. Recent studies indicate that the warm temperate regional climate affords an extended growing season -typically from March to October - which promotes bacterial productivity in the lake. The result is a summer food web dominated by microbial processes. in contrast to the conventional phytoplankton-dominated food chains typically observed in the cold temperate lakes of Europe and North America. Starting with a simple phytoplankton-based food web model and a qualitative definition of system behaviour, we use the RSA procedure to establish the critical role of bacteria-mediated decomposition in Lake Oglethorpe, thus justifying the inclusion of microbial processes. Further analysis reveals the importance of size-dependent selective consumption of phytoplankton and bacteria. Finally, we discuss important practical implications of this novel application of the RSA regarding sampling efficiency and statistical robustness.																			0273-1223						2001	43	7					271	278		10.2166/wst.2001.0435	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2001.0435								11385857					WOS:000169081600034
J	DEHAAN, H				DEHAAN, H			SOLAR UV-LIGHT PENETRATION AND PHOTODEGRADATION OF HUMIC SUBSTANCES IN PEATY LAKE WATER	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The in situ photodegradation of aquatic humic substances by underwater UV light (300-400 nm) in peaty lake water was studied. The photodegradation of aquatic humic substances (HS) occurred at depths where UV light with wavelengths <320 nm can penetrate. The daily photodegradation rate of aquatic HS under a cloudless summer sky in the northern Netherlands appeared to be of the same order of magnitude as that of the mean daily pelagic photosynthetic fixation of dissolved inorganic C in typically oligotrophic humic lakes. However, the measured UV degradation of aquatic HS on a yearly basis is small compared to the approximate annual primary production of temperate lake phytoplankton (8%) and submerged macrophytes (3%) under fertile conditions. The measured UV-light-driven HS degradation implies a higher turnover of organic C in humic lakes than believed so far.																			0024-3590					JUL	1993	38	5					1072	1076		10.4319/lo.1993.38.5.1072	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1993.38.5.1072													WOS:A1993MZ48500016

We found that precipitation was a source of both MeHg and THg to boreal ecosystems, but at lower rates than in industrialized regions of North America and Scandinavia. MeHg concentrations in precipitation ranged from 0.010 to 0.179 ng L(-1) and were highest when events originated west of the ELA. THg concentrations in precipitation ranged from 0.95 to 9.31 ng L(-1) and were highest when the events came from the southeast. There was no relationship between THg and MeHg over time in precipitation. Inputs of both MeHg and THg to ecosystems were highest during summer months.					; St. Louis, Vincent/G-6842-2011	Kelly, Carol/0000-0003-2473-7560; 													0049-6979					FEB	1995	80	1-4					405	414		10.1007/BF01189690	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01189690													WOS:A1995RM44200045

The hydrology of the Albufera Lake, located in the center, combines natural contributions with complex human management. The aim of our study was to develop a new methodology to accurately detect the volume of flood water in complex natural environments which experience significant seasonal changes due to climate and agriculture. The study included 132 Landsat images, covering a 15-year period. The algorithm was adjusted using the NDWI index and simultaneous measurements of water levels in the rice fields. The NDVI index was applied to monitor the cultivated area during the summer. Lake inflows and residence times were also evaluated to quantify how the hydrodynamic of the lake is conditioned by the agricultural management. The algorithm developed is confirmed as a useful ecological tool to monitor the flood cycle of the wetland, being able to detect even the lowest water levels. The flood dynamics are consistent over the fifteen years, being in line with the rice cultivation cycle. Water renewal in Albufera lake is altered with respect to that expected according to the rainfall recorded in the study area, so an improvement in the water management of the hydrological basin is required to optimize the runoff during the rainiest months.

Through assessing the degree of thermal stratification by calculating the dimensionless parameter of thermal resistance to mixing (RTRM) indices from 2008 to 2010, it indicated that the water body of Xiangxi River was stratified strongly in the summer months. The analysis of the degree of thermal stratification with both the meteorological and hydrodynamic factors showed thermal stratification intensity was more sensitive to meteorological factors in Xiangxi River. Through the analysis of the relationship between thermal stratification and water quality, the results indicated that the concentration of Chlorophyll a was higher in the epilimnion affected by the thermal stratification, which could cause algal bloom. The results may further help to evaluate the thermal stratification role in eutrophication process and algal bloom formation in Xiangxi River.

Age, growth and reproduction of non-native largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides (Lacepede, 1802) populations in two temperate African impoundments	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												This study aims to improve the understanding of the establishment success of Micropterus salmoides by assessing growth, maturity and reproductive seasonality of two populations from the temperate region in South Africa. Results are compared to those from other populations to test previously proposed hypotheses that the (i) extent of the spawning season, (ii) longevity, and (iii) growth performance are environmentally temperature dependent. Micropterus salmoides were sampled monthly between March 2010 and March 2012 from Wriggleswade and Mankazana impoundments using either angling or multi-meshed (35, 45, 47, 57, 65, 73, 77, 93, 106, 118, 150 and 153mm) multifilament gillnet fleets, and a 1m seine net. The assessed populations in South Africa performed as expected compared to other introduced populations. Age at maturity (1.3-2years) and length at maturity (232-254mm FL) were similar to other temperate populations. A well-defined, spring spawning season conformed to findings in other temperate populations. Using sectioned sagittal otoliths it was shown that fish were long-lived (14years). Growth rates differed significantly between the two assessed populations but both were slower growing than tropical and subtropical introduced populations. Growth performance (phi: 2.77-2.99) was similar to other temperate populations. These results indicate that the biology of introduced M.salmoides populations in South Africa is comparable to those of other temperate populations and supports the environmental temperature-dependent hypothesis.

For practical reasons, a radar altimeter can only record reflected echoes within its range window. Therefore, water surface elevation must fall within the range window. To this end, the Sentinel-3 radar altimetry mission is configured with a new tracking function (i.e., open loop) to position its range window based on an onboard a priori elevation of ground targets. We found that Sentinel-3 is unable to observe recently built reservoirs due to the incorrect onboard elevations. To overcome this issue, four approaches are proposed to improve the a priori elevation for inland water bodies, particularly reservoirs. These approaches can significantly increase data availability of Sentinel-3 over reservoirs and can be used to prepare the onboard elevations of reservoirs and lakes for future missions such as Sentinel-6, Sentinel-3C/-3D, and the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission.

The model effectively captures observations of both vertical and temporal trends in dissolved oxygen, as well as temporal trends in chlorophyll-a, phosphorus, zooplankton biomass, and several key processes. The model was used to develop a relationship between external phosphorus load and hypolimnion oxygen conditions, and then to establish load-response envelopes that account for inter-annual variability in physical conditions driven by variation in meteorological drivers. The curves provide a valuable tool for reassessing phosphorus loading targets with respect to reducing hypoxia in Lake Erie. (C) 2014 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Th,,,, inventories of both fallout radionuclides are an order of magnitude higher than that which can be supported by the direct atmospheric flux at this latitude. The elevated values may be explained by fallout onto the catchment during the winter being delivered directly to the lakes during the annual thaw. Two of the lakes (Sombre and Heywood) show marked increases in sediment accumulation after c. 1950. This appears to be associated with a documented rise in temperature in the South Orkney Islands, which has caused extensive deglaciation at Signy Island.

We describe two new species: Hygrobates lacrima Pesic sp. nov. (Montenegro) and H. limnocrenicus Pesic sp. nov. (Montenegro, North Macedonia). Although both species are morphologically similar, the average K2P-distance between DNA-barcode sequences from H. limnocrenicus sp. nov. and its closest relative H. setosus was 12.43% (SD = 1.47), and between H. lacrima sp. nov. and its closest relative H. nigromaculatus 15.87% (SD = 1.74). The new species exhibit distinct differences in terms of habitat preference: H. lacrima sp. nov. inhabits pools and shallow eddies along faster flowing waters, whereas H. limnocrenicus sp. nov. prefers deeper, fast flowing water, typically found in the outflow of a limnocrenic springs or lake outlets. The finding of these two new species suggests that efforts to investigate mites of the H. nigromaculatus-complex in the Balkans should be intensified.

Use of Trapa beds by animals may vary with the growth stage of Trapa, but little is known regarding when and how animals use Trapa and nearby, non-Trapa habitat. To clarify seasonal habitat use by the Trapa-feeding chrysomelid beetle (Galerucella nipponensis), we examined seasonal changes in the density of G. nipponensis from Trapa beds and from adjacent emergent vegetation. Furthermore, to determine whether habitat use by beetles is associated with their physiological state, we measured their oviposition and foraging activities. The density of G. nipponensis in each life-stage changed seasonally, with a high density of adults inhabiting emergent vegetation in July, after beetle densities in Trapa beds had declined. Adults collected from Trapa beds showed active egg-laying and foraging activities, while beetles collected from emergent vegetation were in reproductive diapause. This is the first report of G. nipponensis leaving its host plant to initiate summer diapauses in another habitat type.

Trend analysis of reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) provides useful information for understanding the crop water requirements associated with climate change. In this study, monotonic trends were analyzed in monthly, seasonal, and annual timescales at the nine stations selected from Urmia Lake basin. The Mann-Kendall method was used for trend detection. Significant autocorrelation coefficients were taken into account in analysis using the modified version of Mann-Kendall method. In order to estimate the slope of trend line, the Sen's estimator method was used. The ET0 values estimated using the standard recommended form of the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith. The results showed that more than 66.6% of the annual ET0 time series had positive trends which were significant at 0.10 level. The highest slope of annual ET0 trends belonged to the station Marageh, which was equal to 17.34 mm/year. In the seasonal scale, all of the sites (except Tekab) exhibited significant upward trends for spring season in 0.1 level. In the monthly timescale, unless 6.5% of the tested time series, all of them had downward trends. Analysis of the impacts of climatic variables on trends in ET0 showed that the reason for increasing trends in ET0 was attributed to the increasing trends in both mean air temperature and wind speed, as well as the decreasing trend in the mean relative humidity. Wise use of fresh water in this fragile ecosystem is recommended for future sustainable agricultural activities.

J	Liu, FJ; Williams, MW; Caine, N				Liu, FJ; Williams, MW; Caine, N			Source waters and flow paths in an alpine catchment, Colorado Front Range, United States - art. no. W09401	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												[1] Source waters and flow paths of streamflow draining high-elevation catchments of the Colorado Rocky Mountains were determined using isotopic and geochemical tracers during the 1996 snowmelt runoff season at two subcatchments of the Green Lakes Valley, Colorado Front Range. A two-component hydrograph separation using delta(18)O indicates that new water dominated ( 82 +/- 6%) streamflow at the 8-ha Martinelli catchment and old water dominated ( 64 +/- 2%) at the 225-ha Green Lake 4 (GL4) catchment. Snowmelt became isotopically enriched as the melt season progressed, complicating the interpretation of source water models. Thus old water may be underestimated if the temporal variation in delta(18)O of snowmelt is ignored or extrapolated from point measurements to the catchment. Two-component hydrograph separations for unreacted and reacted waters using a single geochemical tracer were not always meaningful. Three-component hydrograph separations using end-member mixing analysis indicated that subsurface flow contributed more than two thirds to the streamflow at both catchments. Talus fields contributed more than 40% of the total discharge during summer at the GL4 catchment. A conceptual model was established for flow generation based on these results. It is suggested that surface water and groundwater interactions are much more important to the quantity and quality of surface water in high-elevation catchments than previously thought.

However, the Guandu has suffered from massive domestic and industrial pollution for more than two decades, leading to high levels of dissolved total phosphorus, cyanobacteria, and enteric bacteria observed during the summers of 2020 and 2021. The use of Phoslock, a palliative compound, was not effective in mitigating the levels of phosphorus in the Guandu River. Furthermore, potable water driven from the river had levels of 2-MIB/geosmin and a mud smell/taste. With all these problems, several solutions are proposed for improving the Guandu River water quality, including establishment of (i) sewage treatment plants (STPs), (ii) strict water quality monitoring, (iii) environmental recovery (e.g., reforestation), and (iv) permanent protected areas. The objective of this paper is to verify the poor water quality in the Guandu and the ineffectiveness and undesired effects of Phoslock.

The results from almost half of the sites were very similar and showed that rivers were of moderate quality. Chlorophyta, Cryptophyta and Euglenophyta were common at sites with higher concentrations of phosphorus and nitrates, the presence of modifications, silty river bottom and higher pH. Nuphar lutea or Cladophora agg. were dominant species in the group of macrophytes and macroscopic algae. Diatoms occurred in significantly higher densities at sites with lower concentrations of nutrients, no or minor modifications, sandy river bottom and higher water conductivity, where Elodea canadensis, Glyceria maxima and Sparganium emersum were dominant macrophyte species.					; Staniszewski, Ryszard/AAF-4337-2020	Jusik, Szymon/0000-0002-2028-1618; Staniszewski, Ryszard/0000-0003-0941-4798; Messyasz, Beata/0000-0002-4371-3591													1018-4619	1610-2304					2014	23	2A					581	588																WOS:000333072400011

Annual ice volume changes 1976-2008 for the New Zealand Southern Alps	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												New Zealand has a long, continuous record of annual end-of-summer-snowline measurements for a set of Southern Alps 'index glaciers' from 1977 to present. These index glaciers are used to estimate annual mass balance and volume water equivalent changes for the over 3000 glaciers on the Southern Alps. Two methods are employed to monitor ice volume changes. Method I deals with the rapid to normal response time glaciers, which tend to be small to medium in size. It uses mass balance gradients and glacier areas to convert changes in snowlines to changes in ice volume water equivalent. Ice volume changes for the period 1976-2008 are calculated for each index glacier, and then extrapolated to most other glaciers of the Southern Alps, using the New Zealand glacier inventory. Method II deals with 12 protracted response glaciers, which tend to be large in size. These have been slow in reacting to a long-term regional warming trend. Instead they still largely retain the ablation areas of a century ago and are in a state of disequilibrium with the present climate. These valley glaciers have recently sustained substantial ice losses that are not able to be detected using Method I. Mass balance deficits and ablation from the 12 large protracted response glaciers are estimated using a geodetic approach based on topographic and lake changes determined from repeated surveys. Results show that estimated ice volume (in water equivalents) for the Southern Alps has decreased from 54.5 km(3) in 1976 to 46.1 km(3) by 2008. This equates to a rate of -0.3 km(3)a(-1) over the last three decades, but this is considerably less than the rate of ice volume loss estimated for the previous 100 years. More than 3000 small and medium-size glaciers account for just 29% of the overall ice volume loss from the Southern Alps, while 71% of the loss occurs from the 12 large protracted response glaciers. Terminus calving contributes 0.8 km(3) and down-wasting of ice tongues in the ablation zone contributes 5.2 km(3). Some preliminary results show that ice volume changes are related to changes in circulation over the New Zealand region. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	NAUWERCK, A				NAUWERCK, A			CYCLOPS-SCUTIFER SARS IN LAKE LATNJAJAURE, SWEDISH LAPLAND	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In Latnjajaure, an ultra-oligotrophic mountain lake in Swedish Lapland, Cyclops scutifer is always present in considerable numbers. During a developing time of 3 years from egg to adult, losses remain low. High survival rates may be explained by lack of predators, even if there is selfcontrol by cannibalism. Temperature, not food supply, appears to be the most important growth steering factor. During more than 9 months of winter, the population is accumulated in water layers below 15 m depth. After the ice-break (July), the adults display diurnal vertical migration, and the distribution pattern in the lake appears extremely patchy. Food search and mating advantages are possible reasons for this behaviour.																			0018-8158					FEB 4	1994	274	1-3					101	114		10.1007/BF00014632	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014632													WOS:A1994MX84100013

MACROZOOBENTHOS OF THE DANUBEAN LAKE CRIVOE IN THE CONDITIONS OF ANTHROPOGENOUS INFLUENCE	VISNYK OF DNIPROPETROVSK UNIVERSITY-BIOLOGY ECOLOGY												In the summer of 2009 macrozoobenthos of the danubean Lake Crivoe, located in the Odessa area was studied. 26 species of sponges, annelids, crustaceans, insects, gastropods and bivalves were revealed. In the upper and middle part of the lake 24 were found, in the lower one 9 species were detected. Oligochetes, and larvae of dragonflies and chironomids are characterised by the greatest number (up to 300 spec/m(2)), the greatest biomass was found for gastropod molluscs (to 17 g/m(2)). The total maximal number of the macrozoobenthos reached 880 spec/m 2 and biomass - 40.2 g/m(2). Benthic faunas of two lakes, Crivoe and Lung, were compared.																			2310-0842	2312-301X					2012	20	1					28	33		10.15421/011204	http://dx.doi.org/10.15421/011204													WOS:000433811000004

However, research on the surface morphol-ogy of lake ice and its interaction with climate is scarce. A large-scale linear structure has repeatedly appeared on satel-lite images of Chagan Lake in recent years. The Geostation-ary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), with a 1 h revisit, and Land-sat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), with a spatial resolu-tion of 30 m, provide the possibility for the study of hourly changes in the large-scale linear structure. We merged the Landsat and GOCI images, using an Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM), and extracted the lengths and angles of the linear structure. We monitored the hourly changes in the surface morphol-ogy during the cold season from 2018 to 2019. The average length of the linear structure in the completely frozen period was 21141.57 +/- 68.36 m. The average azimuth angle was 335.48 +/- 0.23?, nearly perpendicular to the domain wind in winter. Through two field investigations during the two re-cent cold seasons, we verified the linear structure as being ice fractures and ridges. The evolution of surface morphology is closely associated with air temperature, wind, and shoreline geometry.

J	MATTSON, WJ				MATTSON, WJ			ROLE OF INSECTS IN DYNAMICS OF CONE PRODUCTION OF RED PINE	OECOLOGIA												The mortality of red pine [Pinus resinosa] cones was studied for several consecutive years using life tables in 8 different stands in the northern Great Lakes States. Usually, < 20% of a cohort of female flowers survived to maturity. Insects were the main source of mortality and were primarily responsible for annual fluctuations in the abundance of mature cones. Insects were probably responsible, along with late summer weather (especially precipitation), for influencing the rate of initiation and differentiation of flower bud primordia, as shown in a model of the flowering-cone production processes. The devastation of developing cone crops by insects may actually enhance flower primordia production and the future abundance of feeding and breeding sites for cone insects.																			0029-8549	1432-1939					1978	33	3					327	349		10.1007/BF00348117	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00348117								28309596					WOS:A1978EW72000006

However, despite its strong declines in some systems, information on its life history is rudimental. We explored variation in life history patterns of M. salemaai and how this varies with key environmental gradients at the southern range of its distribution. We found that body mass of reproductive females and individual larvae varied among lakes and increased with phosphorus concentrations, whereas growth rates were associated positively with temperature. However, even across strongly contrasting nutrient conditions, M. salemaai had invariant life history timing with a single, synchronised winter recruitment followed by parent mortality. This contrasts with variable reproductive timing of the species reported across the Baltic Sea, probably owing to differences in ambient conditions or genotypes. The highly variable body size at maturity likely facilitates matching of reproduction with seasonal pulses of planktonic food across a broad range of growing conditions. We conclude that current population declines of M. salemaai warrant further investigations into the temporal plasticity of environmental matching.

Temperature Effects Explain Continental Scale Distribution of Cyanobacterial Toxins	TOXINS												Insight into how environmental change determines the production and distribution of cyanobacterial toxins is necessary for risk assessment. Management guidelines currently focus on hepatotoxins (microcystins). Increasing attention is given to other classes, such as neurotoxins (e.g., anatoxin-a) and cytotoxins (e.g., cylindrospermopsin) due to their potency. Most studies examine the relationship between individual toxin variants and environmental factors, such as nutrients, temperature and light. In summer 2015, we collected samples across Europe to investigate the effect of nutrient and temperature gradients on the variability of toxin production at a continental scale. Direct and indirect effects of temperature were the main drivers of the spatial distribution in the toxins produced by the cyanobacterial community, the toxin concentrations and toxin quota. Generalized linear models showed that a Toxin Diversity Index (TDI) increased with latitude, while it decreased with water stability. Increases in TDI were explained through a significant increase in toxin variants such as MC-YR, anatoxin and cylindrospermopsin, accompanied by a decreasing presence of MC-LR. While global warming continues, the direct and indirect effects of increased lake temperatures will drive changes in the distribution of cyanobacterial toxins in Europe, potentially promoting selection of a few highly toxic species or strains.					; Perez-Martinez, Carmen/K-1219-2014; Elersek, Tina/AAL-5672-2021; Montes-Pérez, Jorge/HKO-6043-2023; Kaloudis, Triantafyllos/AGV-0349-2022; Visser, Petra/NJT-4667-2025; Obertegger, Ulrike/A-8254-2010; Gomà, Joan/C-8485-2017; Panksep, Kristel/G-1677-2017; Grabowska, Magdalena/E-2079-2018; Soria, Juan/M-1699-2014; Dunalska, Julita/I-3290-2018; Karpowicz, Maciej/GQH-3334-2022; Moreno-Ostos, Enrique/R-6782-2019; BRAVO, ANDREA G/L-8378-2014; Laas, Alo/G-7992-2016; Paerl, Hans/ABE-7384-2020; De Senerpont Domis, Lisette Nicole/C-2902-2008; Obrador, Biel/A-1856-2009; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012; Vegas-Vilarrúbia, Teresa/B-2973-2008; Ibelings, Bas/B-4237-2011; Santamans, Anna/AAA-9932-2019; Frąk, Magdalena/AAJ-2651-2020; Rochera, Carlos/M-2932-2014; Ubeda, Barbara/AAT-6839-2020; Kruk, Marek/I-8348-2012; Mozo, Antonio/AAE-3707-2020; Salmaso, Nico/O-8968-2015; Delgado Martin, Jordi/H-7819-2015; Ramos-Rodriguez, Eloisa/K-2819-2014; Mankiewicz-Boczek, Joanna/J-2427-2018; Pérez-Martínez, Carmen/K-1219-2014; Demir, Nilsun/H-7762-2012; Maliaka, Valentini/AGC-7710-2022; Leira, Manel/G-3283-2013; Tsiarta, Nikoletta/MEQ-0365-2025; Blaha, Ludek/N-6343-2013; karan, tunay/K-7356-2019; , merbay/AAB-9694-2020; Budzyńska, Agnieszka/AAC-6860-2020; Tuvikene, Lea/H-8799-2016; Flaim, Giovanna/C-7622-2016; Carey, Cayelan/D-4874-2016; Marce, Rafael/H-5147-2012; Seelen, Laura/B-2253-2014; Maronic, Dubravka/AAH-3995-2021; Yağcı, Meral/AAY-6875-2021; Tavşanoğlu, Ülkü/AGK-9942-2022; köker, latife/AAB-7634-2020; Goncalves, Vitor/F-2725-2012; Maliaka, Valentini/M-6801-2017; , reyhan/AAB-8612-2020; Fránková, Markéta/ABC-7501-2021; Pasztaleniec, Agnieszka/AAO-9883-2021; Panksep, Kristel/H-3360-2016; Nawrocka, Lidia/KFA-0262-2024; Catalán, Núria/I-3262-2018; Domis, Lisette N. de/C-2902-2008; Camacho, Antonio/I-3417-2015; Zutinic, Petar/AGR-1031-2022; Grossart, Hans-Peter/E-6705-2017; Gołdyn, Ryszard/J-1093-2018; Mazur-Marzec, Hanna/J-8511-2017; Wilk-Wozniak, Elzbieta/A-4218-2008; Christoffersen, Kirsten Seestern/K-8423-2014; Catalan, Nuria/I-3262-2018; Cillero Castro, Carmen/HSF-4094-2023; Cerasino, Leonardo/G-8466-2011; Napiorkowska-Krzebietke, Agnieszka/I-3874-2018; Antao- Geraldes, Ana Maria/J-8566-2014; Pełechaty, Mariusz/HDN-8393-2022; Pęczuła, Wojciech/T-6681-2018; ozen, arda/A-6066-2010; levi, eti/H-7858-2016; Salmi, Pauliina/AAM-4868-2020; Karakaya, Nusret/ABI-5101-2020; TUNCA, Hatice/GOP-3221-2022; Flaim, Giovanna/AAD-5013-2020; Wasilewicz, Michal/JQJ-5370-2023; Bańkowska-Sobczak, Agnieszka/AFT-2442-2022; Toporowska, Magdalena/AAO-6763-2020; beklioglu, meryem/ABA-1630-2020; Chmura, Damian/A-1301-2016; Goma, Joan/C-8485-2017; Ozkan, Korhan/C-5013-2011; Gkelis, Spyros/N-3484-2015; Boscaini, Alberto/I-7538-2019; KOÇER, Mehmet Ali Turan/B-3333-2019; Ferriol, Carmen/AAC-4591-2020; Marcé, Rafael/H-5147-2012; Peczula, Wojciech/T-6681-2018; Koreiviene, Judita/GNM-7260-2022; özen, arda/ABH-2224-2020; ONGUN SEVİNDİK, Tuğba/JAN-7028-2023; BRAVO, ANDREA/O-8687-2019; CESUR, MEHMET/AAL-5471-2020; Straile, Dietmar/A-4065-2008; Montero, William/ABG-7984-2020; Ozhan, Koray/J-3836-2015; Yilmaz, Mete/AAB-3685-2021; Kocer, Mehmet Ali Turan/B-3333-2019; Teurlincx, Sven/B-8490-2016; Bulut, Cafer/MVY-8279-2025; TRIANTIS, THEODOROS/C-3471-2015; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022; Toporowska, Magdalena/T-9828-2018; Krstic, Svetislav/JED-9857-2023; Udovič, Marija/IZE-0991-2023; ÇELİK, KEMAL/I-5815-2017; Gonçalves, Vítor/F-2725-2012; Raposeiro, Pedro/E-8991-2010; Rosinska, Joanna/J-2864-2012; Hernandez, Armand/K-6606-2012; Carballeira, Rafael/CAJ-1467-2022; Alp, Mehmet Tahir/F-9226-2015; Alp, Mehmet/F-9226-2015; Ochocka, Agnieszka/HKO-2499-2023; geraldes, Ana/J-8566-2014; Vasconcelos, Vitor/A-8933-2008; cerasino, leonardo/G-8466-2011; Galvez, Jose/AAN-4367-2020; Kangro, Kersti/D-8972-2015; Maraşlıoğlu, Faruk/ABE-2510-2021	Goldyn, Ryszard/0000-0001-8325-5161; Pelechata, Aleksandra/0000-0002-7487-8348; Perez-Martinez, Carmen/0000-0001-8777-4487; C.

L.; Suzuki, Koji			An unusual journey of non-migratory Whooping Cranes	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												In 2000, an adult pair of non-migratory Grus americana (Whooping Crane) left Florida and settled in Michigan for the summer. On 21 November, the pair left Michigan and was radio-tracked south to the north shore of Lake Erie. The next day, only the female was detected. She was tracked to Kissimmee Prairie, FL, her release site as a subadult. This female flew from Michigan to Florida in 11 days, only stopping for 2 of those days. Her movement and flight behavior approximated natural Whooping Crane migration behavior. That this adult female could return to her release area and physiologically prepare for a long flight suggests migration is both learned and innate. Our conclusions help refine reintroduction techniques possible for migratory cranes.																			1528-7092	1938-5412					2007	6	3					551	558		10.1656/1528-7092(2007)6[551:AUJONW]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/1528-7092(2007)6[551:AUJONW]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000249790000014

The Canadian investigations involved simultaneous measurements of total vapour-phase mercury concentrations in air sampled immediately above the water surface and over land nearby. A diurnal cycle was observed for mercury emissions from Eagle Lake, with day-time volatilization rates significantly larger than night-time rates. The Swedish field measurements employed a flux chamber. This device was used to determine the rates at which volatile mercury species were emitted from the lakes. Volatilization occurred from each of the Swedish forest lakes during the warmer seasons of the year (with near-surface water temperatures in the 13-23-degrees-C range). For day-time measurements, volatilization rates were generally 3-10 ng Hg m-2 h-1. Day-time fluxes were, on average, about 2.5-times larger than night-time fluxes. Experiments conducted during the winter season (with water temperatures just above the freezing point) indicated very little, if any, emission of volatile mercury species from the lake surface.					; Munthe, John/AEX-9259-2022	Munthe, John/0000-0001-6118-5561; 													0048-9697					SEP 7	1992	125						47	66		10.1016/0048-9697(92)90382-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0048-9697(92)90382-3													WOS:A1992JR72300007

Seasonal Patterns in White Crappies' Consumption and Growth: Influences of Varying Water Temperatures and Prey Availability	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Crappies Pomoxis spp. are popular sport fishes but often fail to achieve sizes that are acceptable to anglers. While many factors may contribute to episodes of suboptimal growth in crappies, insufficient densities of prey fish and high summer water temperatures (>27 degrees C) have been considered to be key underlying causes. We examined the influences of prey fish size, prey availability, and water temperature on the consumption and growth of white crappies P. annularis (ages 1-3) in three Missouri reservoirs over five successive years. Monthly growth rates were estimated using aging analyses, while consumption was estimated using a bioenergetics model. All age-groups grew fastest in the reservoir that was warmest but in which prey fish availability was the highest. Diet analyses coupled with bioenergetics modeling suggested that white crappies were able to maintain positive growth rates at temperatures exceeding 27 degrees C by maximizing consumption rates when adequate prey fish resources were available. When sufficient prey fish resources were unavailable, white crappies fed on invertebrates and often ceased growing or lost weight, even during periods with suitable water temperatures. Our study documents the importance of adequate prey fish resources for maintaining positive growth rates of white crappies, especially during periods of adverse temperature conditions.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					2012	141	3					681	696		10.1080/00028487.2012.675898	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2012.675898													WOS:000306462100012
J	Jeffries, MO; Morris, K; Liston, GE				Jeffries, MO; Morris, K; Liston, GE			A method to determine lake depth and water availability on the north slope of Alaska with spaceborne imaging radar and numerical ice growth modelling	ARCTIC												Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and numerical ice growth modelling were used to determine maximum water depth and water availability in two areas of the North Slope in northwestern Alaska. SAR images obtained between September 1991 and May 1992 were used to identify when and how many lakes froze completely to the bottom, and how many lakes did not freeze completely to the bottom. At Barrow, on the coast, 60% of the lakes froze completely to the bottom in mid-January alone, and by the end of winter 77% of the lakes were completely frozen. In contrast, 100 km to the south in the 'B' Lakes region, only 23% of the lakes froze completely, and there was no sudden freezing of many lakes as occurred at Barrow. A physically based, numerical model was used to simulate ice growth on the lakes. The simulated maximum ice thickness is 2.2 m. Consequently, any lake where some part of the ice cover does not freeze to the bottom has some water more than 2.2 m deep. For those lakes where the ice cover had frozen completely at some time in the winter, the simulated ice growth curve provides the ice thickness at the time each lake had frozen completely to the bottom and thus the lake's maximum water depth. At Barrow, 60% of the lakes are between 1.4 m and 1.5 m deep, and 23% are more than 2.2 m deep. At the 'B' Lakes, 77% of the lakes are more than 2.2 m deep. Thus, there is a considerable contrast in lake depth and water availability between the Barrow and the 'B' Lakes regions. This method is simple to implement, and the relatively inexpensive SAR data have good spatial and temporal coverage. This method could be used to determine lake depth and water availability on the entire North Slope and in other polar and subpolar areas where shallow lakes are common.																			0004-0843	1923-1245				DEC	1996	49	4					367	374																WOS:A1996WA04100008
J	Muenich, RL; Kalcic, M; Scavia, D				Muenich, Rebecca Logsdon; Kalcic, Margaret; Scavia, Donald			Evaluating the Impact of Legacy P and Agricultural Conservation Practices on Nutrient Loads from the Maumee River Watershed	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The recent resurgence of hypoxia and harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie, driven substantially by phosphorus loads from agriculture, have led the United States and Canada to begin developing plans to meet new phosphorus load targets. To provide insight into which agricultural management options could help reach these targets, we tested alternative agricultural-land-use and land-management scenarios on phosphorus loads to Lake Erie. These scenarios highlight certain constraints on phosphorus load reductions from changes in the Maumee River Watershed (MRW), which contributes roughly half of the phosphorus load to the lake's western basin. We evaluate the effects on phosphorus loads under nutrient management strategies, reduction of fertilizer applications, employing vegetative buffers, and implementing widespread cover crops and alternative cropping changes. Results indicate that even if fertilizer application ceased, it may take years to see desired decreases in phosphorus loads, especially if we experience greater spring precipitation or snowmelt. Scenarios also indicate that widespread conversions to perennial crops that may be used for biofuel production are capable of substantially reducing phosphorus loads.

The system of shallow water and temperature evolution equations is discretized with the modified Utnes scheme [4], which is characterized by a semi-decoupling algorithm. The continuity equation is rearranged to Helmholtz equation form. The upwinding Tabata method [3] is used to approximate convective terms. Averaged flow fields under prevailing wind conditions in August were calculated. The temperature variations were also simulated during the flood period in summer 1997. Simulation results are presented and limitations of the model are discussed.																					978-80-85823-61-5				2013							177	184																WOS:000397546900019

Here, late Pleistocene-Holocene EAM rainfall intensity is reconstructed using a well-dated northeastern China closed-basin lake area record located at the modern northwestern fringe of the EAM. The EAM intensity and northern extent alternated rapidly between wet and dry periods on time scales of centuries. Lake levels were 60 mhigher than present during the early andmiddle Holocene, requiring a twofold increase in annual rainfall, which, based on modern rainfall distribution, requires a similar to 400 km northward expansion/migration of the EAM. The lake record is highly correlated with both northern and southern Chinese cave deposit isotope records, supporting rainfall "intensity based"interpretations of these deposits as opposed to an alternative "water vapor sourcing"interpretation. These results indicate that EAM intensity and the northward extent covary on orbital and millennial timescales. The termination of wet conditions at 5.5 ka BP (similar to 35 m lake drop) triggered a large cultural collapse of Early Neolithic cultures in north China, and possibly promoted the emergence of complex societies of the Late Neolithic.

J	ROBARTS, RD				ROBARTS, RD			EFFECT OF RAINSTORMS ON HETEROTROPHIC BACTERIAL-ACTIVITY IN A HYPERTROPHIC AFRICAN LAKE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Hartbeespoort Dam is a hypertrophic man-made lake which is located in the Transvaal Province of South Africa. This region has recently experienced its most severe drought of the century. However, on three occassions in the summer rainy seasons of 1984 and 1985, majro rainfalls (> 50 mm) occurred which caused large inflows to the lake. Inflowing river water entered as a density current causing marked silting of the water. Within the epilimnion (0-10 m) prior to these rainfalls there was usually no variation of bacterial numbers with depth, but heterotrophic bacterial activity (glucose uptake) decreased with depth concomitant with primary production. With the increased river inflow bacterial numbers did not increase but bacterial activity at the bottom of the epilimnion (10 m) increased to as high as 2.7 .mu.g C l-1 h-1 in January 1985, reversing the depth profile of bacterial activity within the epilimnion. This resulted in decreased glucose concentrations (K1 + Sn) and turnover times. Heterotrophic activity per cell increased by between 2.5 and 5 times. These data demonstrate that storm events are important phenomena causing short-term changes in the metabolic activity of planktonic heterotrophic bacteria in lakes.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY 30	1987	148	3					281	286		10.1007/BF00017530	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00017530													WOS:A1987H818100007

Lipid composition and seasonal changes in the mollusk were studied in the natural habitat. In addition to common nonpolar and polar lipids, small amounts of alk-1-enyldiacylglycerol ethers and significant quantities of ceramide aminoethyl phosphonate were present. Total lipid content changed during the year, primarily because of decreased triacylglycerols in winter. The fatty acid compositions of the lipids, remarkably different from that of marine bivalves, and even from other freshwater animals, was especially rich in the .omega.6 fatty acids, linoleic and arachidonic (.apprx. 25%), and poor in the .omega.3 acids, 20:5 and 22:6. The .omega.6/.omega.3 acid ratio was .apprx. 2, which is very high compared to marine bivalves. The fatty acid composition and the .omega.6/.omega.3 acid ratio were constant during the whole year, suggesting a very stable diet rich in vegetal detritus and poor in diatoms. The influence of environmental temperature fluctuation with season on fatty acid composition was negligible. Modest proportions of 22:2 nonmethylene-interrupted (NMI) acids were detected and confirmed by mass spectrometry. 20:2 NMI acids were absent.																			0024-4201	1558-9307					1981	16	2					109	113		10.1007/BF02535683	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02535683													WOS:A1981LF25500005

Hh1 proved to be the best index. The mean spatial overlapping of rotifers was negatively correlated with Hh1 both in the periods of stratification and in the whole periods of observation (stratification plus overturn). The rotifer species diversity was positively correlated with Hh1 only in the periods of stratification during some years.																			0044-4596						1985	46	6					813	823																WOS:A1985AVK7500011

In this study, we revealed the coexistence, ecological risk, and multiple factors affecting variations and sources of PPAHs and SPAHs (nitrated PAHs (NPAHs), oxygenated PAHs (OPAHs)) in the surface sediment-pore water system from a typical urban river in Northern China. The concentration ranges of sigma 26PPAHs, sigma 10NPAHs, and sigma 4OPAHs in the surface sediments were 153.0-5367.4, not detected (N.D.)-105.4, and 42.2-1177.0 ng center dot g-1 dry weight, and fell within 0.6-38.8, N.D.-297.9, and N.D.-212.6 ng center dot mL-1 in the pore waters. The t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (SNE) coupled with the partitioning around medoids (PAM) elucidated spatiotemporal the variations in PAHs, emphasizing the impacts of industrial activities and sewage discharges. Besides the geochemical and hydrochemical conditions, SPAHs were affected by the potential secondary formation, especially during the wet season. The method comparisons indicated the advantages of principal component analysis-multivariate linear regression (PCA-MLR) and n-alkanes model on source identification. PAHs mainly originated from fossil fuel combustion and vehicular exhaust. The top risk quotient (RQ) values for PAHs occurred in the urban and industrial sections. A majority of the surface sediment samples emerged with low to moderate exposure risks, while all the pore water samples showed high exposure risks. The RQs of OPAHs were significantly higher (p < 0.01) than those of PPAHs. The results suggested the secondary formation of SPAHs as an important role in ecological risks of PAHs in the urban river system.

The upper surfaces of the islands are covered with dry white sediments, mostly aragonite or calcite.

For PER, atrazine and NTA, the input and the seasonal variation in the vertical distribution could be described successfully by applying simple box models as well as a one-dimensional vertical model. In the case of PER, it was possible to reconstruct the input history for a long time period (9 years), and it was found that the stagnant boundary layer model was well suited for estimating the average gas exchange rate of this volatile compound between the lake and the atmosphere. Atrazine showed, except for a short time period during the summer, a very conservative behavior in the lake. For NTA, an average in situ rate constant of 0.035 d(-1) was determined for its elimination from the water column. The elimination was attributed primarily to biodegradation. The results of this study demonstrate nicely the power of the combined use of mathematical models, including computer simulations, and field measurements for assessing the environmental behavior of organic pollutants.

The record of the oxygen isotopes from the stalagmites reveals that the undulation characteristics between the cooling event of the glacial period and the warming event of the interglacial period in the research area can compare well to those of ice cores, lake sediments, loess and deep sea sediments on the scale of ten-thousand years or millennium time scale. The climate undulation provided by the record of the stalagmites has a coherence with the global changes and a tele-connection to the paleoclimate changes in the north polar region. Our results suggest that the direct dynamics of paleo-monsoon circulation changes reflected in the record of the stalagmites might be caused by changes of the global ice volume, and in turn related to various factors, including the solar radiation strength at the mid-latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, the southern extension of the ice-rafted event in the North Atlantic, and changes of the equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature at the low-latitudes. Using delta(18)O values, we have calculated the temperatures and the results show that the temperature difference between the penultimate glacial period (with an average temperature of 8.1 degreesC, and a minimum temperature range from 0.65 degreesC to -1.43 degreesC at stage 6) and the last interglacial period (with an average temperature of 18.24 degreesC at sub-stage 5e) was about 10 degreesC. This temperature difference from the record of the stalagmites corresponds in general to the record temperature variation (about 10 degreesC) of measured ice cores. The climate records from the three stalagmites in the two caves have shown that the circulation strength of the Asian summer monsoon and the winter monsoon in the penultimate glacial period and the last interglacial period had a clear change. With the TIMS-U series method, termination II of the penultimate glacial period has been precisely dated at an age of (129.28 +/- 1.10) kaBP for the three stalagmites in the south of Guizhou Province, China. This borderline age represents the-beginning of the last interglacial period or the boundary. between the Middle Pleistocene and the Late Pleistocene, and. corresponds to the beginning age of the last interglacial period shown by the ice cores and in the SPECMAP curve of the marine oxygen isotopes. The chronology determination of termination II is not only of stratigraphic and chronological significance, but also lays an important foundation for discussing the short time scales of climate oscillation and rapidly changing events of paleoclimate in the circulation region of the East Asian monsoon.

The ARTEMIS under-ice AUV docking system	JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS												The ARTEMIS docking system demonstrates autonomous docking capability applicable to robotic exploration of sub-ice oceans and sub-glacial lakes on planetary bodies, as well as here on Earth. In these applications, melted or drilled vertical access shafts restrict vehicle geometry as well as the in-water infrastructure that may be deployed. The ability of the vehicle to return reliably and precisely to the access point is critical for data return, battery charging, and/or vehicle recovery. This paper presents the mechanical, sensor, and software components that make up the ARTEMIS docking system, as well as results from field deployment of the system to McMurdo Sound, Antarctica in the austral spring of 2015. The mechanical design of the system allows the vehicle to approach the dock from any direction and to pitch up after docking for recovery through a vertical access shaft. It uses only a small volume of in-water equipment and may be deployed through a narrow vertical access shaft. The software of the system reduces position estimation error with a hierarchical combination of dead reckoning, acoustic aiding, and machine vision. The system provides critical operational robustness, enabling the vehicle to return autonomously and precisely to the access shaft and latch to the dock with no operator input.					; Blankenship, Donald/G-5935-2010	Lawrence, Justin/0000-0001-7520-5914; Schmidt, Britney Elyce/0000-0001-7376-8510; Lindzey, Laura/0000-0003-3475-0996													1556-4959	1556-4967				MAR	2018	35	2					299	308		10.1002/rob.21740	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rob.21740													WOS:000424259400008

Regression relationships between Al, Fe, and various metals were calculated from the data set. The use of these relationships to identify enhanced metal contents in the Chenier Plain soils is presented. Statistical analyses showed an average Al concentration of 1.6% with a maximum concentration of 4.8% and a minimum concentration of 1.3 mg kg(-1). Al concentration in the sediments was positively correlated at the 1% significance level to Cu (r = 0.577**), Pb (r = 0.936**), Cr (r = 0.969**), Ni (r = 0.830**), Cd (r = 0.617**), and Zn (r = 0.506**), but only a 5% significance correlation was found with Mn (r = 0.148*). Average Fe concentration was 1.2% with a maximum value of 3.4% and a minimum concentration of 9.3 mg kg(-1). Fe concentration in the sediments was positively correlated at the 1% significance level to Cu (r = 0.586**), Pb (r = 0.847**), Cr (r = 0.875**), Ni (r = 0.932**), Cd (r = 0.803**), Zn (r = 0.551**), and Mn (r = 0.479**). These relationships were used to evaluate sites for metal contamination. Data from two known contaminated sites, Capitol Lake (Baton Rouge, LA) and Bayou Trepagnier (LA), fell well outside the prediction limits developed with the Chenier Plain Al and Fe metal regression lines for Cr and Zn. Pb and Cd at Capitol Lake were also elevated beyond the metal/Al prediction developed for the Chenier Plain, but the prediction was not out of range when using the metal/Fe regression. Samples from additional sites with no known metal contamination fell within the predictive limits of the regression equations except for Cd and Pb at some sites. Data presented showed that metal/Al and metal/Fe regression relationships can be used as a tool for identifying areas of potential metal contamination in the coastal zone, but must be regionally correlated.

Comparing water-level policies in a boreal reservoir: How wave and ice energy can help maintain walleye spawning habitat	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Water levels in reservoirs affect the timing and depth of wave and ice forces that help maintain walleye Sander vitreus) spawning habitat. We studied how changes in a water-level management policy ("rule curve') in 2000 affected these forces on 3 lakes of the Narriakan Reservoir, a large boreal reservoir on the border of Canada and the United States. The 2000 rule curve increased mean water levels (0.1 m) during open-water seasons and caused a significant increase in the amount of time each year that wave energy over suitable spawning substrates suspended <0.2 mm sediments at known spawning locations (6-18%,P < 0,01). Conversely, a decrease in the mean range (0.7 m) of water-level elevations during winter seasons caused an 11% decrease (P < 0.01) in the interaction of ice with spawning substrates at known spawning locations. However, ice scour still affected those substrate elevations that were used frequently by walleye during typical spawning seasons. Our findings suggest that water level management is important for maintaining suitable walleye spawning habitats, and that policies can be designed to optimize those habitat conditions.

To study effects of cyanobacterial blooms on plankton diversity and composition, we analyzed data of cyanobacterial, eukaryotic phytoplankton, metazoan zooplankton, and physicochemical samples collected from 24 sites for four seasons in 2017 and 2018 from the large, shallow Lake Taihu. We found that cyanobacterial abundance significantly correlatedwith phytoplankton biomass, species richness, functional richness and evenness, and zooplankton biomass, Shannon's diversity, Simpson's evenness, and functional evenness and richness. High cyanobacterial abundance during summer did not result in low species and functional diversities for both phytoplankton and zooplankton compared with other seasons. Species and functional diversities of sites with high cyanobacteria abundance were not significantly lower than other sites with relatively low cyanobacteria abundance. Structure equation modeling indicated that cyanobacteria had direct influence on phytoplankton and zooplankton compositions. Physicochemical and temporal-spatial factors had direct influence on phytoplankton and zooplankton, and had indirect influence on phytoplankton and zooplankton through direct influence on cyanobacteria. Variance partitioning analysis quantified that cyanobacteria alone and interactions with physicochemical and spatial-temporal factors explained about 10% of phytoplankton variation and 26% of zooplankton variation. Our results indicate that cyanobacteria have substantial effects on phytoplankton and zooplankton biodiversity and community composition. Physicochemical and spatial-temporal factors could potentially obscure the detection of cyanobacterial effects on plankton in Lake Taihu that has cyanobacterial blooms in all seasons.

Sirosa (phalaris) and Dactylis glomerata cv. Porto (cocksfoot) was evaluated for 5 pH treatments at 2 field sites on acidic soils. At one site (Beechworth) the soil was strongly acidic [pH(CaCl2) less-than-or-equal-to 4.2] to depth (80 cm) and contained concentrations of CaCl2-extractable aluminium (Al) >11 mug/g. At the other site (Lake Rowan) the soil pH (0-10 cm) was 5.0 and Al concentrations were <1 mug/g. At Beechworth, lime incorporated at 5.5 t/ha improved establishment of phalaris but plant density declined, and by 30 months after sowing, phalaris plant densities were similar to treatments receiving no lime. Establishment of cocksfoot was less affected by lime application than phalaris, and plant densities were similar to those of phalaris by 26 months after sowing. However, there were no differences between pasture species where no lime was applied. Considerable re-establishment of cocksfoot seedlings occurred regardless of soil treatment. Despite the reported relative sensitivity of phalaris to Al in solution culture experiments, at Beechworth phalaris had more root development at depth than cocksfoot or annual pasture. Although concentrations of Al in the subsoil were high, the perennial deep root system of phalaris may give it an advantage over cocksfoot in terms of survival over summer. A larger root system at depth may give phalaris greater potential than cocksfoot for reducing nitrate leaching and soil acidification. On less acidic soils at the Lake Rowan site, lime application did not affect establishment of either phalaris or cocksfoot. Phalaris had greater persistence than cocksfoot at Lake Rowan. Dry summer conditions at Lake Rowan were the likely cause of poor persistence of cocksfoot. More drought-tolerant cocksfoot cultivars are required if this species is to be a useful perennial grass for pastures in ley cropping areas of Victoria and southern New South Wales.																			0816-1089						1992	32	8					1069	1075		10.1071/EA9921069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EA9921069													WOS:A1992KU62200011

The TLm of unionized hydrogen sulfide for channel catfish fry ranged from 0.8 ppm at pH of 6.8 to 0.53 at pH 7.8. At pH 7.0 the TLm of this gas is 1.0 ppm for fingerling catfish, 1.3 for advanced fingerlings, and 1.4 for adult channel catfish. Small fish were also killed more quickly when exposed to these concentrations. Maximum concentrations of H2S are produced in the spring. Channel catfish populations can be maintained by continued stocking of adult fish or by raising the pH with agricultural limestone, which in turn lowers the toxic unionized hydrogen sulfide.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1967	96	1					31	+		10.1577/1548-8659(1967)96[31:EOHSOC]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1967)96[31:EOHSOC]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A19679678700005

The research area included the Osa river basin (northern Poland), which is located in a lake district. The research was based on historical cartographic materials published in 1900-1947 (German 1:25,000 'Messtischblatt' topographic maps) and modern topographic maps from 2010 (The 1:50,000 Digital Map of the Hydrographic Division of Poland [MPHP]. The number of lakes increased from 173 to 235, while the total surface area of the lakes fell by 107.55 ha. The largest number of lakes belonged to the 1.0-5.0 ha range on both MPHP and Messtischblatt maps. It was in this range that the largest increase in number of lakes and lake area relative to the historical maps was found. A significant reduction in area of lakes was recorded in the group of lakes with an area from 50 to 100 ha.

Population declines resulting from increased anthropogenic pressure have been observed. For semelparous diadromous lampreys, the marine phase remains largely a black box, making targeted management and conservation measures difficult to implement. Here, we collated a database of 168 904 hauls from both fisheries-dependent and fisheries-independent surveys between 1965 and 2019. Lampreys were observed in only 254 hauls (< 1% lamprey presence); 421 sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus and 300 European river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis were identified. Sizes ranged from 13 to 92 cm and from 14 to 42 cm, respectively. The majority of lampreys (61%) were caught by mobile demersal gear types. The highest presence of both species was recorded within the Greater North Sea, followed by the Bay of Biscay. L. fluviatilis was observed closer to the coast than P. marinus. For both lampreys, there was an increase in size with distance from the coast. P. marinus were predominantly < 60 cm and observed from August to February, indicating that these were sexually immature juveniles migrating out to sea. For L. fluviatilis, the majority were thought to be adults (> 20 cm) and occurred in autumn, indicating inshore migration. Our observations provide insight into the ecology of lampreys at sea and highlight study locations and gear types, which may be more pertinent for future research. Greater awareness is needed during surveys to collate catch information on lampreys and improve understanding of their ecology and phenology at sea.					; Laurent, Beaulaton/B-6391-2013; Acou, Anthony/B-1214-2010; Elliott, Sophie/JBR-7909-2023	Rivot, Etienne/0000-0002-5442-121X; Deleys, Noemie/0000-0002-8400-5997; Acou, Anthony/0000-0001-5166-0912													1863-5407	1613-4796					2021	44						409	419		10.3354/esr01113	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/esr01113													WOS:000649277100027
J	Zhang, Q; Carroll, JJ; Dixon, AJ; Anastasio, C				Zhang, Q; Carroll, JJ; Dixon, AJ; Anastasio, C			Aircraft measurements of nitrogen and phosphorus in and around the Lake Tahoe Basin: Implications for possible sources of atmospheric pollutants to Lake Tahoe	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) into Lake Tahoe appears to have been a major factor responsible for the shifting of the lake's nutrient response from N-limited to P-limited. To characterize atmospheric N and P in and around the Lake Tahoe Basin during summer, samples were collected using an instrumented aircraft flown over three locations: the Sierra Nevada foothills east of Sacramento ("low-Sierra"), further east and higher in the Sierra ("mid-Sierra"), and in the Tahoe Basin. Measurements were also made within the smoke plume downwind of an intense forest fire just outside the Tahoe Basin. Samples were collected using a denuder-filter pack sampling system (DFP) and analyzed for gaseous and water-soluble particle components including HNO3/NO3-, NH3/NH4+, organic N (ON), total N, SRP (soluble reactive phosphate) and total P. The average total gaseous and particulate N concentrations (+/- 1sigma) measured over the low- and mid-Sierra were 660 (+/- 270) and 630 (+/- 350) nmol N/m(3)-air, respectively. Total airborne N concentrations in the Tahoe samples were one-half to one-fifth of these values. The forest fire plume had the highest concentration of atmospheric N (860 nmol N/m(3)-air) and a greater contribution of organic N (ON) to the total N compared to nonsmoky conditions. Airborne P was rarely observed over the low- and mid-Sierra but was present at low concentrations over Lake Tahoe, with average (+/- 1sigma) concentrations of 2.3 +/- 2.9 and 2.8 +/- 0.8 nmol p/m(3)-air under typical clear air and slightly smoky air conditions, respectively. Phosphorus in the forest fire plume was present at concentrations similar to10 times greater than over the Tahoe Basin. P in these samples included both fine and coarse particulate phosphate as well as unidentified, possibly organic, gaseous P species. Overall, our results suggest that out-of-basin emissions could be significant sources of nitrogen to Lake Tahoe during the summer and that forest fires could be important sources of both N and P,.

Documentation of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque, 1817) recovery and spawning success from a restored population in the Mississippi River, Missouri, USA	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens are considered rare and were nearly extirpated in the Mississippi River in Missouri by 1931 as a result of overfishing and habitat fragmentation. Propagation efforts have been implemented by the Missouri Department of Conservation since 1984 as means to restore the lake sturgeon population. Although recent population increases have been observed, a formalized evaluation to determine if lake sturgeon are self-sustaining in the Missouri portion of the Mississippi River has not been completed. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to: (i) determine the proportion of reproductive individuals, (ii) evaluate seasonal movement patterns of adults, and (iii) validate purported spawning locations within the Mississippi River in Missouri. Lake sturgeon catch data indicated that approximately 11 percent of the population are reproductively mature. Additionally, telemetry data confirms that the greatest movement by adult lake sturgeon occurs during spring, which suggests spawning behavior. Finally, it was possible to document lake sturgeon embryos and emergent fry larvae below Melvin Price Locks and Dam 26 in the Upper Mississippi River near St. Louis, Missouri. Water velocity, depth, and substrate size were measured at this location and embryos were collected and hatched in the laboratory. River gage data suggest that spawning behavior may have been elicited by a large influx of water during a drawdown period of water above the dam. This study represents the first documented spawning of A.fulvescens in the Mississippi River and highlights the success of recovery efforts in Missouri.

Since these lakes play a significant role in ice sheet dynamics and bed lubrication, their continuous monitoring in a warming Arctic is becoming essential. The 31st ACM SIGSPATIAL competition (GISCUP 2023) aims to automate the detection of these lakes using satellite imagery. In this paper, we present two solutions to this problem based on image segmentation techniques: a DeepLabv3+ model that ranked first, and a U-Net-based approach that ranked fourth. We provide details about our implementations and explain the rationale behind our choices and the challenges we faced. Our results contribute to the understanding of supraglacial lake fluctuations and offer a valuable tool for ongoing environmental monitoring.					; Perez Ortiz, Edwyn/HGD-8377-2022	Chapuis, Bertil/0000-0003-3168-5375; Perez-Uribe, Andres/0000-0003-3062-2575; Marquis, Remy/0009-0003-8800-2050															979-8-4007-0168-9				2023							29	32		10.1145/3589132.3629970	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3589132.3629970													WOS:001156830400015

Influences of human activity and climate on the stock-recruitment dynamics of whitefish, Coregonus lavaretus, in Lake Geneva	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												P>Analysis of long-term catches from the deep peri-alpine Lake Geneva, showed a shift in the stock-recruitment relationship of Coregonus lavaretus (L.), a target species of commercial fishing. This change was mainly related to large-scale meteorological factors. Higher spring water temperatures may have improved larval survival and hence recruitment of whitefish via: (1) a better match between the hatching date of whitefish larvae and development of their zooplankton prey; and (2) the positive temperature effect on larval growth. In Lake Geneva, changes in regulatory mechanisms coupled with stocking and improved water-quality have led to an explosion in the C. lavaretus population in recent years. These results highlight the relevance of long-term changes in the stock-recruitment relationship for management of aquatic ecosystems that are sensitive to climate forcing.

Spectral differences were detected between different water areas. Seventeen aquatic complexes or types were classified separately on the basis of changes in water characteristics and depth, bottom quality and vegetational succession. The vegetation in summer 1983 was recorded in this way and reviewed against previous mappings in order to illustrate the multitemporal aspects of Landsat studies. Landsat classification could be used equally effectively in large area control, offering as it does the possibility of mapping the distribution of certain types of coastal environment over large areas by means of reflected radiation intensities.																			0304-3770	1879-1522					1985	21	4					325	346		10.1016/0304-3770(85)90075-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(85)90075-0													WOS:A1985AHV9900002
J	Fu, MM				Fu, Minmin			Revisiting Western United States Hydroclimate During the Last Deglaciation	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												During the last ice age, the western United States was covered by large lakes, sustained partly by higher levels of precipitation. Increased rainfall was driven by the atmospheric circulation associated with the presence of large North American ice sheets, yet Pleistocene lakes generally reached their highstands not at glacial maximum but during deglaciation. Prior modeling studies, however, showed nearly monotonic drying since the last glacial maximum. Here I show that iTraCE, a new transient climate simulation of the last deglaciation, reproduces a robust peak in winter rainfall over the Great Basin near 16 ka. The simulated peak is driven by a transient strengthening and southward shift of the midlatitude jet. While meltwater forcing is an important driver of changes to the North Pacific Jet, changing orbital conditions and rising atmospheric CO2 also shift the jet south and contribute to wetter conditions over the western US during deglaciation.

High biomasses (ca. 400 g m (2) DW) of freshwater macroalgae Chara spp. were found in all ponds. However, higher biomasses (ca. 900 and 1600 g m (2) DW for aerial and root parts, respectively) were found for broadleaf cattails Typha spp. with perennial structures. Biomasses of Chara were mainly controlled by seasonal variations and water level of the ponds. Metal contents in Chara vulgaris beds were higher than those in Chara globularis and, with less than half of the biomass corresponded to the same range than those found in Typha. For the latter, the highest contents of metals were found in the root system. Sediments of the ponds were moderately contaminated and the concentrations of the four metals were very low in the water (often under detection level). Translocation factors of the contaminants from sediment to plants were very low (parts per thousand) for all species and phytoextraction of metals from the sediment seemed not to be the main effect of the spontaneous vegetation. However, this latter prevent pollutant transfers provided that the dry and crumbly Chara are collected during summer before being blown outside the pond by strong winds. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In Lake Ontario, sediment down-flux rates and corresponding contaminant down-flux rates were highest in winter during periods of unstratified thermal conditions, and generally increased with depth due to the influence of resuspended bottom sediments during all sampling periods. Lake Ontario suspended sediments exhibited the highest concentrations of metals; concentrations of mercury and lead frequently exceeded guideline values for bottom sediments. Contaminant levels in Lake Ontario suspended sediments were similar to concentrations in bottom sediments in the same area. There was a spatial trend toward higher suspended sediment metals concentrations from the eastern basin to the western basin of Lake Erie, which is similar to the trend in bottom sediment contamination. In the eastern basin of Lake Erie, which is the deepest area of the lake, there was no trend in down-flux rate with depth in 2001; however, down-flux rates increased with depth in 2002. Suspended sediments in the western basin of Lake Erie were determined to be largely resuspended bottom sediments; all western basin samples collected in the study exceeded the guideline value for mercury (0.486 mu g/g).																			0167-6369					JUL	2007	130	1-3					149	161		10.1007/s10661-006-9385-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-006-9385-4								17057964					WOS:000246732600014
J	Xue, JB; Zhong, W				Xue JiBin; Zhong Wei			Holocene climate variation denoted by Barkol Lake sediments in northeastern Xinjiang and its possible linkage to the high and low latitude climates	SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES												The climate over the closed inland Barkol Lake, which is located in northeastern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, is significantly influenced by westerly winds today. To improve our understanding of past climate processes in westerly wind influenced regions in northwestern China, a 250-cm sediment section was retrieved from this lake. After taking the carbon reservoir effect into consideration, the chronological sequence of this section was reconstructed based on seven conventional radiocarbon dates of bulk samples, and the bottom age of this section was determined to be about 9400 cal a BP. Multi-proxy datasets, including delta O-18(car), delta C-13(car) of authigenic carbonate, and total organic carbon were examined using wavelet analysis and singular spectrum analysis methods. Results show that the Holocene in the Barkol Lake region can be divided into four stages: (1) a cold and dry early stage before similar to 8000 cal a BP; (2) a moderately warm and wet middle stage between similar to 8000 and 6000 cal a BP; (3) a warm and dry stage, along with a cooling-wetting tendency from 6000 to 2700 cal a BP; and (4) a fluctuating cooling and wet stage between 2700-800 cal a BP, and a drier stage since 800 cal a BP. The general trend of Holocene climatic changes revealed by Barkol Lake sediments was in agreement with that of adjacent regions. We infer that climatic changes during the Holocene in the Barkol Lake region were influenced not only by high latitudes, especially the North Atlantic region climate, but also tropical low-latitude processes, such as the El Nio/La Nia-Southern Oscillation. This study demonstrates that the enhanced activities of ENSO may have played an important role in climatic changes in northeastern Xinjiang during the Holocene. Our results also suggest that climatic patterns may be temporally different in the northern Xinjiang area in response to the changing predominant control of either the Westerly or the Asian summer monsoon, depending on the contrast of their relative strengths.

It is of great scientific significance to study the vertical physical and chemical indexes and phytoplankton characteristics of the Qiandao Lake to reveal the aquatic ecosystem structure of the thermally stratified lake. Conventional observation uses in-situ profile instruments, which is time consuming and labor intensive. In recent years, lidar has shown increasing oceanic applications; however, it has not yet been extensively applied in inland water. There are no studies using lidar for detecting subsurface plankton layer in Qiandao Lake. In this study, we investigated the applicability of this technology for identifying subsurface plankton layer. A simple and fast phytoplankton layer detection method was introduced. The lidar-detected layer was found to well correspond with that of the in-situ measured subsurface chlorophyll maximum layer (SCML) and phycocyanin maximum layer.

One core contains a major 27-28 month period and several lesser lines of marginal statistical significance. The strong signal suggest a record of a northern latitude quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). The record in seasonal riverine sedimentation covers a period of half a millennium. Corresponding data from the "downriver" estuarine (piston) core fail to show a QBO-like period but disclose periods of 3.6, 3.8, 7.6 and 19.1 years, some of which may be tidal, though their statistical significance is probably questionable. As a working hypothesis the watershed serves as a large area seasonal precipitation concentrator similar to the case of the Harding ice field and Skilak lake. Alaska. If so. what is witnessed is an equatorial to polar transport of moisture modulated by the equatorial QBO. An alternate model would be based more directly upon temperature, i.e. glacial melt. Combination of these cannot be ruled out. No evidence for solar forcing at an 11-yr period is found in either core, contrary to Skilak Lake, Alaska varve data.																			0921-8181					NOV	1992	98	1					57	65																WOS:A1992KB34200007

Seasonal effects of food quality and temperature on body stoichiometry, biochemistry, and biomass production in Daphnia populations	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Food quality and temperature can affect zooplankton production in lakes by altering organismal metabolism. However, the influence of these factors on consumer nutritional physiology and population biomass remains relatively understudied in natural populations. Here, we examined seasonal changes in body stoichiometry, biochemistry, and population biomass in two Daphnia species collected from two separate lakes differing in dietary phosphorus (P) supply. Food quality, measured as seston carbon:P (C:P) ratios, varied throughout the study in each lake, and water temperatures generally increased across the growing season. Daphnid elemental composition was correlated with food quality in both populations, but relationships between daphnid body stoichiometry and temperature were consistently stronger as Daphnia body C:P ratios and content of major biochemical pools declined simultaneously throughout the summer, which largely coincided with increased water temperatures. Warmer temperatures were associated with relaxed %P-RNA coupling as daphnid body RNA content declined and P content remained relatively high. These responses combined with temperature related decreases in Daphnia body %lipids and %C appeared to explain declines in daphnid body C:P ratios in both lakes over the growing season. Seasonal changes in population biomass were related to both food quality and water temperature in the lower nutrient lake. Biomass production under more eutrophic conditions however was unrelated to food quality and was instead associated with seasonal temperature changes in the higher nutrient lake. Overall, our study shows that seasonal changes in temperature and resource quality may differentially affect consumer stoichiometry and biomass production in lake ecosystems by altering consumer elemental metabolism.					; Wagner, Nicole/HNQ-6584-2023; Prater, Clay/I-5674-2019; Frost, Paul/AAT-6633-2021	Prater, Clay/0000-0002-9864-6242; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2018	63	4					1727	1740		10.1002/lno.10803	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10803													WOS:000440928800018

Its capabilities to study the rhythmic processes in plankton ecosystems were demonstrated using the natural testing in Lake Baikal in summer. The results of in situ measurements of plankton to detect the synchronization of collective biological rhythms with medium parameters are presented and interpreted. The most significant rhythms in terms of the correlation of their parameters with medium factors are identified. The study shows that the correlation with water temperature at the mooring site has the greatest significance and reliability.

However, the lake area has decreased in recent decades due to sediment influx. The rate of this decline and the areal evolution of Phewa Lake due to artificial damming and sedimentation is disputed in the literature due to the lack of a historical time series. In this paper, we present an analysis of the lake's evolution from 1926 to 2018 and model the 50-year trajectory of shrinkage. The area of Phewa Lake expanded from 2.44 +/- 1.02 km(2) in 1926 to a maximum of 4.61 +/- 0.07 km(2) in 1961. However, the lake area change was poorly constrained prior to a 1957-1958 map. The contemporary lake area was 4.02 +/- 0.07 km(2) in April 2018, and expands seasonally by 0.18 km(2) due to the summer monsoon. We found no evidence to support a lake area of 10 km(2) in 1956-1957, despite frequent reporting of this value in the literature. Based on the rate of areal decline and sediment influx, we estimate the lake will lose 80% of its storage capacity in the next 110-347 years, which will affect recreational use, agricultural irrigation, fishing, and a one-megawatt hydroelectric power facility. Mitigation of lake shrinkage will require addressing landslide activity and sediment transport in the watershed, as well as urban expansion along the shores.

Spatial and temporal variability of bacterial indicators and pathogens in six California reservoirs during extreme drought	WATER RESEARCH												California has one of the largest systems of surface water reservoirs in the world, providing irrigation water to California's agriculturally productive Central Valley. Irrigation water is recognized as a vehicle for the microbial contamination of raw produce and must be monitored according to new federal regulation. The purpose of this study was to further understanding of the variability of fecal indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli and fecal coliforms) and pathogens (E. coli O157:147 (O157), non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) and Salmonella) along both horizontal and vertical profiles within California reservoirs. Monthly sampling was conducted in six reservoirs located in the foothills of the Western Sierra Nevada during the summer irrigation season and extreme drought conditions of 2014 (n = 257). Concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria were highly variable between reservoirs (p < 0.05) and along the horizontal profile (p < 0.001) from upstream to downstream, with higher concentrations typically found outside of the reservoirs than within. Though many of the reservoirs were thermally stratified, bacterial concentrations were not associated with water temperature (p > 0.05) or any one particular depth strata (p < 0.05). However, prevalence of Salmonella and STEC (16/70 and 9/70 respectively) was higher in the deep strata than in mid or surface layers. We found no statistical association between samples collected downstream of reservoirs and those from the reservoirs themselves. Continued monitoring and modeling of both bacterial indicators and enteric pathogens are critical to our ability to estimate the risk of surface irrigation water supplies and make appropriate management decisions.

J	Fox, KR; Lytle, DA				Fox, KR; Lytle, DA			Milwaukee's crypto outbreak: Investigation and recommendations	JOURNAL AMERICAN WATER WORKS ASSOCIATION												In March and April 1993, the largest US waterborne disease outbreak occurred in Milwaukee, Wis., causing illness in more than 400,000 people. The etiological agent responsible for most cases was Cryptosporidium. Milwaukee was served by two water treatment plants that used raw water from Lake Michigan. Before the outbreak, severe spring storms caused the lake's turbidity and bacterial counts to rise dramatically During the outbreak, effluent produced by one plant had a turbidity approaching 2.5 ntu, a high reading that indicated an increase in particulates passing through the plant. The increase may have also meant an increase in passage of Cryptosporidium oocysts. This article discusses the investigation by the Water Supply and Water Resources Division (formerly the Drinking Water Research Division) of the US Environmental Protection Agency into what may have happened to allow the oocysts to pass through the treatment plant.																			0003-150X					SEP	1996	88	9					87	94		10.1002/j.1551-8833.1996.tb06615.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/j.1551-8833.1996.tb06615.x													WOS:A1996VH20800011

Interannual variability in trophic status of shallow lakes on the Boreal Plain: Is there a climate signal?	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												[1] We explored relations between climate and trophic status of shallow lakes (lake area > 5 ha, mean depth < 3.2 m) located on the subhumid western Boreal Plain of Canada. Correlation and regression analyses were used to assess the association between indicators of climate and satellite-based estimates of trophic status (chlorophyll alpha (Chl alpha)). Chl a was derived using red band reflectance of Landsat satellite images for 76 lakes, which were then averaged for each year to produce a landscape median for summer (August) over a 20-year period from 1984 and 2003. Our results showed that climate was related to interannual changes in trophic status. Average May temperature was positively correlated to Chl a, suggesting the importance of conditions in the early part of the growing season. Growing season effective precipitation (P - PET) was negatively correlated to Chl a such that wetter conditions seemed to lead to a dilution of Chl a. Very wet years resulted in a larger Chl a drop than one expected by a linear model, suggesting greater water contribution from the landscape. P - PET explained 64% of the variance in Chl a using a nonlinear regression tree. Our study offers clues as to how shallow lake systems may behave on the subhumid Boreal Plain as a function of future climate change.

To accomplish this, water samples were collected from different locations and during different months. The trophic status of these sampling sites ranged from eutrophic to hypertrophic. Cluster and multidimensional scaling analyses revealed that the temporal transition in the diversity of the bacterioplankton occurred primarily in response to a cyanobacterial bloom, and that all samples could be divided into normal-bloom, peak-bloom and winter period groups. Spatial differences in the bacterial diversity were also detected among the three sampling sites, with diversity being found to be strongly correlated with the gradient of the trophic status of the three sampling sites. In addition, these temporal and spatial changes could be characterized by several specific DGGE bands. The results were further analyzed by canonical correspondence analysis, which revealed that the bacterioplankton diversity of Lake Taihu was primarily associated with temperature, pH, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and dissolved oxygen. Of these factors, TN and TP were only shown to be significant influencing factors at Wuxi, which had the highest trophic level.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				AUG	2009	31	8					885	897		10.1093/plankt/fbp028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbp028													WOS:000267889300009

The relative impact of urbanization and precipitation on long-term water level variations in the Yangtze River Delta	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The combined and individual hydrological impacts of climate variation and urbanization have been extensively discussed over the past few decades, yet little is known about the relative impact of each. In this paper we took one of the most developed regions worldwide, Yangtze River Delta, as an example to analyse the long-term relative impacts of precipitation and urbanization change on water level alterations, based on precipitation, water level series, and annual impervious area data from 1960 to 2015. Abrupt changes detection in the water level series divided the data into the pre-impact period (1960-1988) and impacted period (1989-2015), and relative impacts of precipitation and urbanization on the water level increase from pre-impacted to impacted period, as well as their spatial and seasonal variations were estimated with the elasticity method. The results indicated that the urbanization change showed no distinct influence on the water level rise in the pre-impact period, while the precipitation played distinct roles only during summer months in the impacted period; the precipitation dominated two thirds of the water level rise in flood season, and in non-flood season the urbanization controlled the two thirds of the water level rise; spatially, the water level variations in old and new urban area were dominated by precipitation and urbanization process respectively; compared with precipitation amount, the water level correlated more strongly to the contribution ratio of precipitation. The results would provide a good reference for flood control and water resource management in the river basin, especially in the economically developed areas. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This resulted in increased nutrient concentrations and abundance of all major phytoplankton divisions. During this seven-year study, conducted between 1979 and 1987, average annual chlorophyll a levels increased from 12-13 mg/m3 to 19-22 mg/m3. Water clarity declined, and this was attributable to higher algal biomass and not to increases in abiotic turbidity. Summer blue-green algal density and relative abundance to the phytoplankton increased over time coincident with macrophyte elimination. Densities of rotifers, cladocerans, and total zooplankton decreased approximately 1.5 years after macrophyte removal. This decline was likely due to increased abundance of planktivorous fishes.																			0270-5060					MAR	1992	7	1					81	95		10.1080/02705060.1992.9664673	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1992.9664673													WOS:A1992HK69500010

Analyses demonstrated higher relative concentrations of plant-available soil nutrients and higher density of plants on flooded emergent wetlands as compared to infrequently flooded, unconsolidated shore sites. Flooding resulted in anaerobic soil conditions and increased concentrations of nutrients for wetland plants. The density of emergent wetland plants was highest where the topographic conditions and water level led to duration of flooding between 50 and 85% of the growing season. The effects of long-term water level fluctuations on wetlands were measured from historical aerial photographs of low, average, and high lake level conditions (1938 to 1980). An increase in water levels of 0.3 m reduced the extent of coastal wetlands by 18%. Historical aerial photos demonstrated and a model predicted that 13% of the total wetlands measured at low lake levels remained in the study area at the highest lake level sampled.

However, it is difficult to describe the relationship between the reflectance and the concentration of non-optically active substances due to their weak optical characteristics, and machine learning has become a viable solution for this problem. Therefore, based on machine learning methods, this study estimated four non-optically active water quality parameters including the permanganate index (CODMn), dissolved oxygen (DO), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP). Specifically, four machine learning models including Support Vector Machine Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) were constructed for each parameter and their performances were assessed. The results showed that the optimal models of CODMn, DO, TN, and TP were RF (R2 = 0.52), SVR (R2 = 0.36), XGBoost (R2 = 0.45), and RF (R2 = 0.39), respectively. The seasonal 10 m water quality over the Zhejiang Province was measured using these optimal models based on Sentinel-2 images, and the spatiotemporal distribution was analyzed. The results indicated that the annual mean values of CODMn, DO, TN, and TP in 2022 were 2.3 mg/L, 6.6 mg/L, 1.85 mg/L, and 0.063 mg/L, respectively, and the water quality in the western Zhejiang region was better than that in the northeastern Zhejiang region. The seasonal variations in water quality and possible causes were further discussed with some regions as examples. It was found that DO would decrease and CODMn would increase in summer due to the higher temperature and other factors. The results of this study helped understand the water quality in Zhejiang Province and can also be applied to the integrated management of the water environment. The models constructed in this study can also provide references for related research.					shi, zhou/A-2283-2015; shi, Zhou/M-7845-2019	shi, zhou/0000-0003-3914-5402; 														2072-4292				FEB	2024	16	3							514	10.3390/rs16030514	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16030514													WOS:001160149200001

The empirical relationships between nutrient (total nitrogen, TN; total phosphorus, TP) and chlorophyll a (Chla) level are widely used as a theoretical basis for lake eutrophication management. Here, seasonal environmental variables and Chla from 2005 to 2020 in Chinese shallow eutrophic Lake Taihu were examined and Chla-nutrient equations in the entire period and annually from 2005 to 2020 were explored using 95% quantile regression model. The results showed robust linear relationships of logChla-logTN and logChla-logTP in the vast majority of cases. Based on Chla-nutrient equations in the entire study period, 0.69 mg/L TN and 52 mu g/L TP are recommended as nutrient threshold in Lake Taihu. Furthermore, the results revealed increasing Chla sensitivity to nutrient for each study month (i.e. February, May, August, and November) from 2005 to 2020, whose drivers included increase in water temperature and water level, decrease in wind speed, mass ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus, and grazing effect. It is noteworthy that atmospheric stilling is likely to be the key climatic factor promoting annual peak Chla in Lake Taihu. For one, the deviations of the sub-index of Trophic State Index indicated that light is a critical limiting factor of summer Chla in Lake Taihu. For another, calmer water mainly due to atmospheric stilling decreased near 40% non-algal turbidity and a substantially increased buoyant cyanobacteria during the study period, improving phytoplankton "light niche". Thus, increasing algal sensitivity to nutrient occurred until the additional algal-turbidity induce further light limitations or the exhaustion of TN (or TP) cause nutrient limitation. Given atmospheric stilling is a global phenomenon, this study would affect future algal bloom mitigation efforts in shallow lakes as temperature is always the focus in the recent literatures on global climate change.					xu, hai/JEP-5422-2023; Zhang, Yunlin/N-5464-2014	, Zou/0000-0001-9697-5168; Zhang, Yunlin/0000-0002-3382-4570													0301-4797	1095-8630				MAR 15	2022	306								114476	10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.114476	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.114476		JAN 2022						35051816					WOS:000878688000002

Annual load declined by 40-50% during the last years (1991-97). Phosphorus retention fluctuated strongly during the seasonal cycle between -200 and +100 kgP d(-1) and from year to year between -44% and + 26% of the P import. At the end of the eighties, the P retention capacity of the sediment was exceeded and Muggelsee became a source of phosphorus. The lake regained its ability to retain P in the sediments after external load reduction in the 1990s. However, the internal load of P reached the level of the external one. The release of P during summer was strongly related to the import of nitrate. On long-term average (1979-1997), less than 1% of the P input was retained in Muggelsee. About 24% of the nitrogen load were removed in the lake on annual mean. This rate decreased during the last years.					; Köhler, Jan/C-2633-2014	Kohler, Jan/0000-0003-1894-2912; 													0018-8158	1573-5117					1999	408						159	166		10.1023/A:1017023717324	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017023717324													WOS:000084892400018
J	Li, Q				Li, Qian			Eocene ctenodactyloid rodent assemblages and diversification from Erden Obo, Nei Mongol, China	HISTORICAL BIOLOGY												New ctenodactyloid occurrences (Yuomys magnus sp. nov., Gobiomys neimongolensis and Gobiomys exiguus) from the 'Lower Red' to the 'Upper Red' beds of the Erden Obo section in Nei Mongol, China are reported. Here, we present an updated review of the ctenodactyloid rodents from the Erden Obo section. We have recognised eight species and one indeterminate species belonging to six genera: Advenimus, Chenomys, Gobiomys, Tamquammys, Simplicimys, and Yuomys. The ctenodactyloids show an initial burst in diversification in the upper part of the 'Basal Red' of the early Eocene. A maximum richness peak is present at the lower part of the 'Basal White' which falls near the boundary of early and middle Eocene. Gobiomys, the only surviving genus from the 'Middle Red' to the 'Upper Red' beds, shows that the diversity of ctenodactyloids declined rapidly after late middle Eocene. Based on the study of the abundant ctenodactyloid rodents, we recognise some evolutionary tendencies among Eocene ctenodactyloids.																			0891-2963	1029-2381				AUG 9	2019	31	7					813	823		10.1080/08912963.2017.1395422	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08912963.2017.1395422													WOS:000473026400001

The lake water is brackish, alkaline, unpolluted, and abundant in SO42- and Mg2+. The lacustrine ecosystem of Lake Sayram has been intensely investigated. However, profiles of the microbial communities in the lake remain largely unknown. In this study, taxonomic compositions of the planktonic and sedimentary bacterial communities in Lake Sayram were investigated using 16S rRNA metagenomics. The lacustrine bacterial communities were generally structured by environmental conditions, including the hydrological and physicochemical parameters. Proteobacteria was the dominating phylum. In the lake water, the genera Acinetobacter and Ilumatobacter held an absolute predominance, implying their metabolic significance. In the bottom sediment, biogeochemically significant bacteria and thermophilic or acidothermophilic extremophiles were recovered. In contrast to the planktonic bacteria, an appreciable portion of the sedimentary bacteria could not be classified into any known taxonomic unit, indicating the largely unknown bacteriosphere hiding in the bottom sediment of Lake Sayram.

The red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) is one of the most invasive species worldwide, with a documented ability to deplete basal food resources and alter the structure of aquatic food webs. The red swamp crayfish has extensively invaded the Poyang Lake wetland, located in the middle reach of the Yangtze River basin. Here, we use an isotopic mixing model (MixSIAR) with data from stable isotope ratios (delta C-13, delta N-15) to estimate relative contributions of potential resources to the biomass of red swamp crayfish and ten common native species, and we use hierarchical clustering analysis to assess basal resource breadth and interspecific similarity of invasive and native species. We hypothesized that red swamp crayfish and several native species have similar trophic niches and may compete for basal resources. Results from the mixing model demonstrated seasonal variation in the basal resource of all species, including the red swamp crayfish and native snails, prawns, and fishes. Submerged macrophytes and detritus were estimated to be the most important sources during the rising-water season; during the high-water season, emergent macrophytes and detritus were most important; and during the falling-water season, detritus, POM, and floating macrophytes were most important. Resource overlap was substantial between the invasive crayfish and dominant native species, particularly the freshwater snail (Bellamya aeruginosa), indicating the potential exists for negative impact from competition under conditions of resource limitation.

Core MAG14-2A (194 m) contains a middle Pleistocene to Holocene record, whereas core NAS15/19 (4.36 m) covers only the late Holocene. Surficial sediments from springs and shallow-water sites were sampled in both basins. MAG14-2A rests on trachyte dated at 1.08 Ma. Diatoms are rare in the oldest sediments, but well preserved after about 545 ka, documenting a trend from less to more saline water. Core MAG14-2A contains fifteen facies, five of which are diatomaceous. In contrast, NAS15/19 is dominated by two facies, each containing well-preserved diatoms. Both sequences are distinct from others of similar age in the Kenya Rift in lacking pedogenic horizons, reflecting the location of Lake Magadi and Nasikie Engida in a tectonic sump where aquatic environments were maintained by geothermal and meteoric springs. Canonical Correspondence Analysis distinguishes three assemblages in the modern surface muds of Lake Magadi and Nasikie Engida, but with no pre-Holocene counterparts. Eleven diatom zones are recognised in MAG14-2A: Zones D2 to D10 contain rare to common diatoms dominated by Aulacoseira granulata and its varieties, Aulacoseira agassizii, Thalassiosira faurii, Thalassiosira rudolfi and Cyclotella meneghiniana. Individual samples commonly include a mixture of benthic and planktonic taxa and saline and freshwater species. These assemblages indicate waters that ranged between pH 7.4 and 11.5 with conductivities of similar to 300 to > 25,000 mu S cm(-1). Correlations with the neighbouring Olorgesailie and Koora Basins indicate four major environmental phases that affected the south Kenya Rift during the last million years with fresh to moderately saline water, or land surfaces, developing during Phase I (1000 to 750 ka). These environments gave way to generally wetter conditions and freshwater lakes in all basins during Phase II (similar to 750 to 500 ka). Phase III (similar to 500 to 325 ka) was characterised by drier conditions with paleoenvironments becoming more variable and dry during Phase IV (325 ka to present).					; Sier, Mark/AAA-8778-2020; Deocampo, Daniel/A-9830-2010; Rabideaux, Nathan/K-7572-2015; De Cort, Gijs/J-9565-2019	Rabideaux, Nathan/0000-0002-3406-0541; De Cort, Gijs/0000-0001-7437-4943; Owen, Richard Bernhart/0000-0001-5267-5366; Sier, Mark Jan/0000-0002-4145-0556; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				MAR	2021	65	3					315	333		10.1007/s10933-020-00173-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-020-00173-7		JAN 2021											WOS:000608651500001

J	Wasmund, N				Wasmund, N			Occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in the Baltic sea in relation to environmental conditions	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												Cyanobacterial blooms occur regularly in summer in central parts of the Baltic Sea. They are mainly composed of Aphanizomenon sp. and Nodularia spumigena. Both species have almost similar ecological requirements and can roughly be considered a uniform functional group. In order to identify factors that might favour bloom development, water quality data from monitoring programmes were compared with bloom distribution. A salinity from 3.8 to 11.5 PSU proved important for the spatial distribution of the bloom development. The bloom's onset was triggered by temperatures approximating 16 degrees C provided that global radiation was > 120 W/m(2) (daily mean) and wind speed was < 6 m/s. Nutrient concentrations decreased immediately before the bloom. The bloom's development ceased with poor weather conditions characterized by low irradiation or high wind speed.																			0020-9309						1997	82	2					169	184		10.1002/iroh.19970820205	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19970820205													WOS:A1997XK40000004
J	Hudak, D; Rodriguez, P; Donaldson, N				Hudak, David; Rodriguez, Peter; Donaldson, Norman			Validation of the CloudSat precipitation occurrence algorithm using the Canadian C band radar network	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The ability of CloudSat to detect precipitation in cold season cloud systems is examined using data from the Environment Canada C band weather radar at King City, Ontario. The factors complicating the comparison are the time mismatch, the differences in sensitivity, and the changes to the geometry of cross section with range from the ground radar, W band radar attenuation, and the effect of ground clutter. A total of 40 overpasses with precipitation were observed over the King City radar from September 2006 to April 2007. In about 14% of the precipitation profiles, time mismatches were diagnosed. When these cases were removed, the skill scores of the CloudSat precipitation occurrence product were excellent. The most frequent cause of a false detection was an incorrect precipitation threshold in the algorithm. The most frequent cause of a miss in detection was ground clutter removal of valid echoes by the algorithm. Overall, the CloudSat algorithm handled the effect of attenuation very well. Improvement to the algorithm would arise from a better tuning of the precipitation threshold, a threshold of -10 dBZ instead of -18 dBZ being more appropriate for winter storms in the Great Lakes area, and more effective ground clutter filtering in the lowest four range bins of the CloudSat data. The methodology employed here and the 1456 verified precipitation profiles from CloudSat can serve as a framework for a test bed to evaluate precipitation products from CloudSat.																			2169-897X					SEP 19	2008	113	D18							D00A07	10.1029/2008JD009992	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2008JD009992													WOS:000259396400003

Distribution, abundance, and vertical migrations of Leptodora kindtii in a mainstem Missouri River reservoir, Montana	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Leptodora kindtii, a large, mobile, predaceous cladoceran zooplankter has been shown to make diel vertical migrations in some localities. L. kindtii were sampled in summer in the headwaters of Fort Peck Reservoir, Montana, USA, to assess and compare their day/night abundance in three habitat types (riverine, transitional, and reservoir), to determine if L. kindtii mean size and abundance differed vertically and horizontally, and to determine if their distribution differed under different turbidities and water temperatures. L. kindtii were sampled in six periods from 22 July to 10 September 2002 using a bongo net towed at set depths. Abundance displayed a patchy, highly variable distribution among periods and habitat types and among samples within periods and habitat types. Greatest abundances were found within the reservoir habitat type. Diurnal phase was not significantly related to L. kindtii abundance at depth. Highest daytime abundances were found at 1.25m or deeper for five of six sample periods. Highest nighttime abundances were found at 1.25m or deeper in three of the six sample periods. Significant interaction was found between diurnal phase and depth in five of six periods. In general, higher L. kindtii abundance was observed in association with higher water temperatures and lower turbidities.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				APR 3	2014	29	2					171	186		10.1080/02705060.2013.844736	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2013.844736													WOS:000334039500002

Thermokarst Lakes, Ecosystems with Intense Microbial Processes of the Methane Cycle	MICROBIOLOGY												Thermokarst lakes are formed as a result of thawing of ice-rich permafrost, causing development of land depressions which in flat areas are filled with water in the case of positive water balance. Activation of the thermokarst process is one of the possible indicators of permafrost degradation under the conditions of global warming. Thermokarst lakes occur in the areas of continuous, discontinuous, and sporadic permafrost, i.e., in Siberia, Alaska, Canada, and northern Scandinavia. Specific microbial communities adapted to long-term exposure to low temperatures develop in such lakes. They vary in the rates of aerobic and anaerobic metabolism depending on the mineral composition of bottom sediments, availability of organic matter, limnological and hydrological features of the lakes. High rates of methane emission are characteristic of a number of thermokarst lakes. Recent studies of thermokarst lakes revealed active methane formation via various methanogenic pathways, as well as aerobic and anaerobic methane oxidation by diverse methanogenic and methanotrophic bacteria and archaea. The question of what mechanisms and microorganisms are involved in anaerobic methane oxidation, which may be responsible for up to 80% of methane consumption in thermokarst lakes, remains, however, open. The microorganisms actively functioning beneath the ice during the long winter season, while highly important for northern aquatic ecosystems, also remain insufficiently studied. Almost no serious microbiological research on thermokarst lakes has been carried out in Russia, although permafrost occupies up to 65% of its territory, thermokarst process is common, and thermokarst lakes are numerous.					; Kallistova, Anna/D-7810-2014; Rusanov, Igor/Q-5874-2018	Kallistova, Anna/0000-0003-4088-4093; 													0026-2617	1608-3237				NOV	2019	88	6					649	661		10.1134/S0026261719060043	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0026261719060043													WOS:000512067800001

Changes in the population of this species were investigated over the last 23 years through literature reviews, field monitoring, and surveys undertaken from 1993 to 2016. Data from 111 sites were collected and analyzed for population assessment. including 11 known breeding sites in Madagascar (n= 6), Mayotte (n= 4), and Europa (n = 1). Trend analyses were done with surveys from 1993-2016 (omitting 1996) and population estimates from the last 5 years of surveys, 2012-2016. The species occurred in all types of wetlands including lakes, ponds, marshes, rivers, mangroves, pasture wet meadow, and rice fields. During the non-breeding season (May-September), many pond-herons migrate to eastern and central Africa; however, some birds (911 records) remained in Madagascar and Mayotte during austral winter. Data show the current population estimated at similar to 1100 breeding birds in the total breeding area. The population has declined significantly. with 41.6% and 52.9% declines, respectively, at the two colony sites in Tsimbazaza and Tsarasaotra parks with the longest history of breeding. Main threats to the species are habitat destruction, collection of eggs and fledglings, predation. and human disturbance at all breeding sites.

Similar tendency of increased transparency measured by penetration of photosynthetic solar radiation (blue, green and red light components) was reported, while the turbidity measured by absorbance at 550 nm did not show separation between invaded and uninvaded waters. Hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentration, oxygen saturation and pH were significantly higher in waters with Dreissena spp. during the time of thermal summer stratification. In reservoirs, the strength of Dreissena effect on all three recorded variables depends strongly on water level fluctuations.

Integration of MODIS-derived metrics to assess interannual variability in snowpack, lake ice, and NDVI in southwest Alaska	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Impacts of global climate change are expected to result in greater variation in the seasonality of snowpack, lake ice, and vegetation dynamics in southwest Alaska. All have wide-reaching physical and biological ecosystem effects in the region. We used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) calibrated radiance, snow cover extent, and vegetation index products for interpreting interannual variation in the duration and extent of snowpack, lake ice, and vegetation dynamics for southwest Alaska. The approach integrates multiple seasonal metrics across large ecological regions. Throughout the observation period (2001-2007), snow cover duration was stable within ecoregions, with variable start and end dates. The start of the lake ice season lagged the snow season by 2 to 3 months. Within a given lake, freeze-up dates varied in timing and duration, while break-up dates were more consistent. Vegetation phenology varied less than snow and ice metrics, with start-of-season dates comparatively consistent across years. The start of growing season and snow melt were related to one another as they are both temperature dependent. Higher than average temperatures during the El Nino winter of 2002-2003 were expressed in anomalous ice and snow season patterns. We are developing a consistent, MODIS-based dataset that will be used to monitor temporal trends of each of these seasonal metrics and to map areas of change for the study area.

J	Izaguirre, G; Taylor, WD				Izaguirre, G; Taylor, WD			A Pseudanabaena species from Castaic Lake, California, that produces 2-methylisoborneol	WATER RESEARCH												Castaic Lake, a large reservoir in Southern California, experienced a two-month episode of the musty-smelling compound 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) in the fall of 1993. MIB levels in the water column reached or exceeded 150 ng/l. A Pseudanabaena bloom coincided with the off-flavor event. Fourteen odorous strains of the cyanobacterium were isolated, and eight of them were analyzed by gas-chromatographic methods to verify the presence of MIB in culture. The concentrations of MIB in culture ranged from 36 to 445 mu g/l: This is the first documented report, to our knowledge, of a major MIB episode in United States drinking water that was attributable to Pseudanabaena, an organism not generally recognized as a taste-and-odor producer.

The nonlinearity of water quality variables due to the complex chemical and physical processes in a body of water makes the modeling process difficult. This study used an artificial neural network (ANN) approach, a powerful computational tool for nonlinear relationships, to develop a model that estimates the summer concentration of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in US lakes using interrelated and easily measurable water quality parameters. Two ANN models, using regional and national data sets, and one linear regression model were trained, tested, and validated using three inputs (pH, conductivity, and turbidity) that were statistically correlated with the outputs. The prediction accuracy of the ANN models consistently outperformed the linear regression model. The statistical accuracy of the ANN models for regional data sets was superior to that of the national data set. A sensitivity analysis showed that pH was the most predictive parameter for nutrients. These results indicate that the ANN modeling technique can be a screening tool for an overall estimation of nutrient concentrations in regional lakes.

The Wood Lake, Ontario, H4 ordinary chondrite, a new Canadian meteorite	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The Wood Lake meteorite was found in the Muskoka region of Ontario in July 2003. We examine the mineralogy, physical properties, shock, and weathering state of this recently reported Canadian meteorite. Bulk physical properties for Wood Lake (bulk density 3.57 +/- 0.10 g/cm(3), grain density 3.64 +/- 0.01 g/cm(3), and magnetic susceptibility log chi = 5.17) are typical of slightly weathered H chondrite falls and consistent with visual observations of its observed low weathering state (W1). Reconnaissance X-ray micro computed tomography of a Wood Lake fragment yields a similar bulk density (3.56 g/cm(3)) and allows for a three-dimensional description of the meteorite. Petrographic and electron probe microanalysis examination of the Wood Lake meteorite reveal sharp definition of chondrule margins, occasional mesostasis chondrule glass, only minor development of recrystallized matrix feldspar, and little variation in silicate chemical compositions, indicating Wood Lake to be an H4 ordinary chondrite. Mineral chemistry for Wood Lake olivine (Fa(18.6) (+/-) (0.7), n = 26) and low-Ca pyroxene (Fs(17.5) (+/-) (2.6), n = 16) agrees well with H chondrite averages for these minerals. The bulk of the stone has undergone a low to moderate level of shock (S3), as indicated in thin section by undulose optical extinction and the presence of planar dislocations in olivine and pyroxene grains. Moderate distortion of olivine crystal structures observed using in situ micro X-ray diffraction quantifies the shock deformation as a full width half maximum (FWHM chi) of 3.38 degrees +/- 1.13 degrees (16 reflections from seven olivine grains), consistent with shock stage S3 ordinary chondrites. Wood Lake is confirmed as a new Canadian meteorite find that likely arrived on Earth not long before it was recovered.

An impending water crisis in Canada's western prairie provinces	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Canada is usually considered to be a country with abundant freshwater, but in its western prairie provinces (WPP), an area 1/5 the size of Europe, freshwater is scarce. European settlement of the WPP did not begin until the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Fortuitously, the period since European settlement appears to have been the wettest century of the past two millennia. The frequent, long periods of drought that characterized earlier centuries of the past two millennia were largely absent in the 20th century. Here, we show that climate warming and human modifications to catchments have already significantly reduced the flows of major rivers of the WPP during the summer months, when human demand and in-stream flow needs are greatest. We predict that in the near future climate warming, via its effects on glaciers, snow-packs, and evaporation, will combine with cyclic drought and rapidly increasing human activity in the WPP to cause a crisis in water quantity and quality with far-reaching implications.

Geology of the Mid-Miocene Rooster Comb Caldera and Lake Owyhee Volcanic Field, eastern Oregon: Silicic volcanism associated with Grande Ronde flood basalt	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The Lake Owyhee Volcanic Field (LOW) of eastern Oregon consists of rhyolitic caldera centers and lava fields contemporaneous with and spatially related to Mid-Miocene Columbia River flood basalt volcanism. Previous studies delineated two calderas in the southeastern part of LOW near Owyhee Reservoir, the result of eruptions of two ignimbrites, the Tuff of Leslie Gulch and the Tuff of Spring Creek. Our new interpretation is that these two map units are differentially altered parts of a single ignimbrite produced in a major phreatomagmatic eruption at similar to 15.8 Ma. Areas previously mapped as Tuff of Spring Creek are locations where the ignimbrite contains abundant clinoptilolite +/- mordenite, which made it susceptible to erosion. The resistant intracaldera Tuff of Leslie Gulch has an alteration assemblage of albite +/- quartz, indicative of low-temperature hydrothermal alteration. Our new mapping of caldera lake sediments and pre- and post-caldera rhyolitic lavas and intrusions that are chemically similar to intracaldera Tuff of Leslie Gulch point to a single similar to 20 x 25 km caldera, which we name the Rooster Comb Caldera. Erosion of the resurgently uplifted southern half of the caldera created dramatic exposures of intracaldera Tuff of Leslie Gulch cut by post-caldera rhyolite dikes and intrusions that are the deeper-level equivalents of lava domes and flows that erupted into the caldera lake preserved in exposures to the northeast. The Rooster Comb Caldera has features in common with more southerly Mid-Miocene calderas of the McDermitt Volcanic Field and High Rock Caldera Complex, including formation in a basinal setting shortly after flood basalt eruptions ceased in the region, and forming on eruption of peralkaline ignimbrite. The volcanism at Rooster Comb Caldera postdates the main activity at McDermitt and High Rock, but, like it, begins similar to 300 ky after flood basalt volcanism begins in the area, and while flood basalts don't erupt through the silicic focus, are contemporaneous with the latest stages of eruptions nearby. High Rock and McDermitt rhyolites are associated with propagation of Steens Basalt dikes to the south, and LOW rhyolites with later propagation of Grande Ronde Basalt dikes to the north and north-northwest.

Chloride Balance in Freshwater System of a Highly Anthropized Subalpine Area: Load and Source Quantification Through a Watershed Approach	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Recent studies have highlighted an increase of chloride in many lakes worldwide, with negative effects on chemical and physical properties of inland waters and freshwater biota. In this study, we assessed the long-term trend (1993-2017) of chloride in Lake Iseo, located in the midlatitudes, and analyzed its relationship with discharge data of the inflows and hydrological and hydroclimatic changes. Additionally, we performed a specific annual survey, collecting water samples at a biweekly frequency in tributaries, calculating chloride load, and comparing the result with the chloride increase observed in lacustrine water. The combined use of Geographic Information System (GIS) and multivariate analyses allowed identification of possible sources of chloride and their seasonal dynamic within the mixed-land-use watershed: impervious surface and deicing salt, population and sewage effluents, livestock, and rainwater. Their potential contribution to total mass balance was assessed, cross-checking the results between chloride source evaluation and load estimation. Chloride load from wastewater treatment plants played an important role, albeit we highlighted that the main source was the road deicing salt, with a primarily winter contribution. The increased anthropization in the watershed was likely the main cause of the chloride enhancement. This study demonstrates that the problem of salinization can also affect lakes located in the midlatitude areas and provides a reproducible method for the identification and quantification of the different sources. Our results will help to better understand the potential sources of salinity in rivers that may reveal processes controlling the salinization of freshwater systems, with implications for future management practices.					; Nava, Veronica/E-6989-2018; Nava, Veronica/LDG-5826-2024; Bonomi, Tullia/K-8482-2019; Rotiroti, Marco/A-9941-2015; Zanotti, Chiara/IAR-1822-2023	LEONI, BARBARA/0000-0001-9448-9457; FUMAGALLI, MARIA LETIZIA/0000-0002-2993-6692; Nava, Veronica/0000-0002-2770-1937; Bonomi, Tullia/0000-0001-6374-5163; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				JAN	2020	56	1							e2019WR026024	10.1029/2019WR026024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019WR026024													WOS:000520132500040

The research embraced 22 lakes in Poland over the period 1961-2010. Strong relations were found to hold between NAO and individual characteristics of ice phenology. In a negative NAO phase, one can observe a later appearance of ice phenomena and ice cover compared with the average values, ice cover persisting even 30 days longer and being thicker even by more than 10 cm. In turn, in a positive NAO phase the duration of ice phenomena and ice cover is shorter, the cover being less thick and solid. The observed spatial differences in the effect of NAO on the pattern of ice phenomena in Poland show this matter to be fairly complex. The most significant factor changes in climatic conditions, which manifest themselves in the continentality of the climate growing eastwards.					; Wrzesiński, Dariusz/I-5765-2019; Ptak, Mariusz/O-3217-2015	Wrzesinski, Dariusz/0000-0001-5025-1447; Choinski, Adam/0000-0001-9006-0952; Ptak, Mariusz/0000-0003-1225-1686													1895-6572	1895-7455				DEC	2015	63	6					1664	1684		10.1515/acgeo-2015-0055	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/acgeo-2015-0055													WOS:000368428100010

However, detailed carbon balances of the stream-lake continuum are rare. Combining eddy covariance (EC) measurements of lake-atmosphere net ecosystem CO2 exchange with measurements of fluvial C fluxes (dissolved organic C, DOC; particulate organic C, POC; dissolved inorganic C, DIC), and in-lake sedimentation, we here present a detailed annual C balance of an oligotrophic clearwater lake in the eastern European Alps. The C flux into the lake was 1522 Mg C year(-1) by DIC (93%), DOC (6%), and POC (0.7%). The largest C losses were fluvial exports (1595 Mg C year(-1)) of DIC (93%), DOC (6%), and POC (0.8%), while sedimentation accounted for 7.3 Mg C year(-1). The residual of all fluvial and sedimentation fluxes revealed the lake as a net sink of atmospheric CO2 of 77 Mg C year(-1). The EC measurement confirmed a small positive or negative contribution of atmospheric exchange to the lake C balance. In-lake transfer among C pools was only significant for the flux from DIC to POC (8.4 Mg C year(-1)), which, following our model, is the transfer through primary production in summer. Fluvial DOC and DIC fluxes were controlled by discharge; POC retention and sedimentation depended on the meteorological season and in-lake residence time. Following our findings, we conclude that hydrology acted as the most important control for the C balance of this clearwater mountain lake by controlling inflow, outflow, and sedimentation fluxes.

Twilight on Ligeia: Implications of communications geometry and seasonal winds for exploring Titan's seas 2020-2040	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH												Titan's lakes and seas are targets of particular interest for future exploration. We review candidate splashdown areas in Ligeia and Kraken Mare, and Ontario Lacus. Titan's thick and dense atmosphere means that landing dispersions of spacecraft are dominated by uncertainties in wind drift, and thus the feasibility of landing safely in the sea with a simple Huygens-like descent system (i.e. without guidance or propulsion) is dependent upon these uncertainties being small enough that the landing point dispersion lies within the sea. Because Titan's winds vary with season, notably through the formation of a high-speed stratospheric jet in the winter hemisphere, landing point dispersions are seasonally-dependent as well as latitude-dependent. Ligeia Mare, at 78 degrees N, sees relatively small dispersions but offers viable Direct-to-Earth (DTE) communication only until 2024. A wide part of Kraken Mare (450 x 90 km) at 70 degrees N can be comfortably reached at all times, and is viable for assured Direct-to-Earth communication until 2026, or with a relay spacecraft thereafter. The seasonal geometry permits DTE from the northern seas again after 2040. Wind dispersions are always too large for Ontario, unless a steerable parachute or similar system is used to tighten the landing ellipse. (C) 2015 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Increased nitrogen deposition in wetfall and changes in climate currently affect Green Lakes Valley within the Colorado Front Range. Research conducted within the alpine links chronic nitrogen inputs to a suite of ecological impacts, resulting in increased nitrate export. The atmospheric nitrogen flux decreased by 0.56 kg ha(-1) year(-1) between 2000 and 2009, due to decreased precipitation; however alpine nitrate yields increased by 40 % relative to the previous decade (1990-1999). Long term trends indicate that weathering products such as sulfate, calcium, and silica have also increased over the same period. The geochemical composition of thawing permafrost, as indicated by rock glacial and blockfield meltwater, suggests it is the source of these weathering products. Furthermore, mass balance models indicate the high ammonium loads within glacial meltwater are rapidly nitrified, contributing similar to 0.5-1.4 kg N ha(-1) to the growing season nitrate flux from the alpine watershed. The sustained export of these solutes during dry, summer months is likely facilitated by thawing cryosphere providing hydraulic connectivity late into the growing season. This mechanism is further supported by the lack of upward weathering or nitrogen solute trends in a neighboring catchment which lacks permafrost and glacial features. These findings suggest that reductions of atmospheric nitrogen deposition alone may not improve water quality, as cryospheric thaw exposes soils to biological and geochemical processes that may affect alpine nitrate concentrations as much as atmospheric deposition trends.

Atmospheric blocking is predicted using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS), and PM2.5 concentration in Seoul of the same period are obtained from the surface measurements of the National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER). We define blocking indices using two methods: the anomaly method and the gradient method. Correlation analysis establishes the relationship between the blocking and PM2.5 concentrations in Seoul. The result based on the anomaly method exhibits strong positive and negative correlation coefficients respectively over the East Sea and Japan and the vicinity of Lake Baikal. The correlation coefficient from the blocking index of the gradient method reveals a similar pattern, and the maximum values are found within the longitude range of 130-150 degrees E Building on the relationship between PM2.5 in Seoul and the blocking index, we perform PM2.5 prediction using the GFS forecast of the atmospheric blocking index. The prediction shows reliable performance at least up to a five-day forecast. This atmospheric blocking based dynamical and statistical PM2.5 prediction can be a useful tool for mid-range PM2.5 forecast.																			1352-2310	1873-2844				FEB 1	2021	246								118141	10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.118141	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.118141		JAN 2021											WOS:000613544600005

Round Goby Detection in Lakes Huron and Michigan-An Evaluation of eDNA and Fish Catches	FISHES												Aquatic surveys for fish in large water bodies (e.g., Laurentian Great Lakes of North America) often require a flexible approach using multiple methods, surveying different depths, and sampling across seasons, especially when the target species is elusive in its natural habitat. The round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) is an invasive, bottom-dwelling fish inhabiting rocky areas of all five Great Lakes. While trawl surveys are typically used for abundance assessments, angling has been demonstrated as a means of supplementing surveys with additional data. Yet, round goby abundance and distribution is still not well described. Recently, with considerable success, scientists have explored sampling environmental DNA (eDNA) to complement traditional monitoring techniques for population abundance estimates, early detection of invasive species, and spawning or migration events. Therefore, we collected eDNA from water samples alongside bottom trawls and hook and line angling in Lakes Huron and Michigan to detect round goby. eDNA samples were analyzed by both droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) to maximize the likelihood of detection. Overall, round goby was captured in 23% of the trawls, but the eDNA based methods detected round goby in 74% and 66% of samples by ddPCR and qPCR, respectively, mostly in samples collected at <30 m depths, and mostly in the fall. More studies comparing eDNA based methods to traditional monitoring, especially trawls in large open waters, may contribute to a better understanding of using eDNA in population assessments.

Seasonal changes in peatland surface elevation recorded at GPS stations in the Red Lake Peatlands, northern Minnesota, USA	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Northern peatlands appear to hold large volumes of free-phase gas (e.g., CH4 and CO2), which has been detected by surface deformations, pore pressure profiles, and electromagnetic surveys. Determining the gas content and its impact in peat is challenging because gas storage depends on both the elastic properties of the peat matrix and the buoyant forces exerted by pore fluids. We therefore used a viscoelastic deformation model to estimate these variables by adjusting model runs to reproduce observed changes in peat surface elevation within a 1300 km(2) peatland. A local GPS network documented significant changes in surface elevations throughout the year with the greatest vertical displacements associated with rapid changes in peat water content and unloadings due to melting of the winter snowpack. These changes were coherent with changes in water table elevation and also abnormal pore pressure changes measured by nests of instrumented piezometers. The deformation model reproduced these changes when the gas content was adjusted to 10% of peat volume, and Young's modulus was varied between 5 and 100 kPa as the peat profile shifted from tension to compression. In contrast, the model predicted little peat deformation when the gas content was 3% or lower. These model simulations are consistent with previous estimates of gas volume in northern peatlands and suggest an upper limit of gas storage controlled by the elastic moduli of the peat fabric.					; Rosenberry, Donald/C-2241-2013	Rosenberry, Donald/0000-0003-0681-5641; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				DEC	2013	118	4					1616	1626		10.1002/2013JG002404	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2013JG002404													WOS:000329871400023
J	Gu, Q; Yu, Q; Grogan, P				Gu, Qian; Yu, Qiang; Grogan, Paul			Cryptogam plant community stability: Warming weakens influences of species richness but enhances effects of evenness	ECOLOGY												Community stability is a fundamental factor sustaining ecosystem functioning and is affected by species richness and species evenness. The Arctic is warming more rapidly than other biomes, and cryptogam plant species (specifically lichens and bryophytes in this study) are major contributors to tundra biodiversity and productivity. However, to our knowledge, the impacts of warming on cryptogam community stability and the underlying mechanisms have not been investigated. We conducted a 13-year summer warming experiment in mesic birch hummock tundra vegetation near Daring Lake in the continental interior of low Arctic Canada and recorded patterns of cryptogam species abundance in several different growing seasons. Warming decreased the stability of total community abundance, had no effects on species richness, but increased species evenness and species synchrony. Structural equation model analyses indicated that higher species richness was the principal factor associated with the stronger community abundance stability in the control plots and that this effect was driven primarily by a negative correlation with species synchrony. By contrast, higher species evenness was the principal factor associated with the weakened community abundance stability in the warming plots, and this effect was driven primarily by a positive correlation with species synchrony. Our study suggests that climate warming could reduce cryptogam plant community stability in low Arctic tundra and, therefore, decrease important ecosystem services, including carbon storage and food availability to caribou in northern regions.

Preface: Impacts of extreme climate events and disturbances on carbon dynamics	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The impacts of extreme climate events and disturbances (ECE +/- D) on the carbon cycle have received growing attention in recent years. This special issue showcases a collection of recent advances in understanding the impacts of ECE +/- D on carbon cycling. Notable advances include quantifying how harvesting activities impact forest structure, carbon pool dynamics, and recovery processes; observed drastic increases of the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and dissolved methane in thermokarst lakes in western Siberia during a summer warming event; disentangling the roles of herbivores and fire on forest carbon dioxide flux; direct and indirect impacts of fire on the global carbon balance; and improved atmospheric inversion of regional carbon sources and sinks by incorporating disturbances. Combined, studies herein indicate several major research needs. First, disturbances and extreme events can interact with one another, and it is important to understand their overall impacts and also disentangle their effects on the carbon cycle. Second, current ecosystem models are not skillful enough to correctly simulate the underlying processes and impacts of ECE +/- D (e.g., tree mortality and carbon consequences). Third, benchmark data characterizing the timing, location, type, and magnitude of disturbances must be systematically created to improve our ability to quantify carbon dynamics over large areas. Finally, improving the representation of ECE +/- D in regional climate/earth system models and accounting for the resulting feedbacks to climate are essential for understanding the interactions between climate and ecosystem dynamics.

(common carp) linked to seasonal changes and host ages in Lake Manyas, Turkey	BULLETIN OF THE EUROPEAN ASSOCIATION OF FISH PATHOLOGISTS												In the current study, the metazoan parasite fauna of Cyprinus carpio L. in Lake Manyas, Turkey, was determined by on-site surveys carried out between January 1997 and November 1998. Five parasite species were found: Dactylogyrus extensus (Monogenea) on the gills; Bothriocephalus acheilognathi (Cestoda); Caryophyllaeus laticeps, (Cestoda) and Pseudocapillaria tomentosa (Nematoda) in the intestine; and Argulus foliaceus (Crustacea) on oral cavity, gills, fins and skin. Among these species, P. tomentosa was recorded for the first time in Turkey. Changes in prevalence and mean intensity of the parasites were found as follows: for D. extensus 41.5%, 20.20 +/- 17.71; for B. acheilognathi 13.2%, 3.43 +/- 2.52; for C. laticeps 7.54%, 1.67 +/- 0.65; for R tomentosa 19.4%, 4.29 +/- 3.23; for A. foliaceus 22.0%, 13.03 +/- 10.69. The infection levels were higher in 1997 for D. extensus, P. tomentosa and A. foliaceus but higher in 1998 for C. laticeps and B. acheilognathi. The infection levels were higher in summer for all the parasite species, except for C. laticeps. D. extensus, B. acheilognathi and A. foliaceus were found on all host fish ages with erratically changing levels. The others were observed only on some of the host fish age.

J	Cargnelli, LM; Gross, MR				Cargnelli, LM; Gross, MR			The temporal dimension in fish recruitment: Birth date, body size, and size-dependent survival in a sunfish (bluegill: Lepomis macrochirus)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Many fish species are protracted spawners, producing fry over a several-week breeding season. We demonstrate that this time dimension has important implications for recruitment by relating the body size and survival of yearlings to the day that they were born. The production of bluegill sunfish fry was estimated throughout the 1993 spawning season in Lake Opinicon, Ontario. In 1994, yearlings were collected and otolith daily growth rings used to determine their 1993 date of birth. We found that yearling body size decreased with date of birth in 1993. There was a progressive decline in body size across the eight spawning bouts, resulting in a 50% difference in the size at age 1 of early- and late-born fry. This difference is apparently due to the longer growing season available to early-born fry. Fry born earlier in the season also had strikingly higher survivorship to age 1 than fry from the middle- or late-season bouts. Fry produced during the first trimester increased 231% in representation among yearlings. This increased survivorship is probably due to increased over-winter survivorship and possibly also size-selective predation. These results highlight the importance of the temporal dimension in understanding the nature of fish recruitment.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				FEB	1996	53	2					360	367		10.1139/cjfas-53-2-360	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-53-2-360													WOS:A1996UK63200014
J	Becker, MW; Daw, A				Becker, MW; Daw, A			Influence of lake morphology and clarity on water surface temperature as measured by EOS ASTER	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Relationships between lake morphometric parameters and nighttime lake surface temperatures were investigated in North American temperate lakes using the ASTER kinetic temperature (AST08) product. Nighttime ASTER kinetic temperature measurements were found to be a good analogue for nighttime surface temperatures. Linear regression between ASTER and buoy-measured temperatures in a test lake were better during the evening (R-2=0.98) than the day (R-2=0.90), presumably due to the greater influence of radiation and latent heat fluxes during daylight hours. Nighttime lake surface temperatures measured in three ASTER scenes were significantly correlated to logarithm of lake area, maximum lake depth, Secchi depth (a measure of lake clarity) and lake order (a measure of lake connection with surface drainage), during October and November. Nighttime lake surface temperatures were significantly correlated only With lake area in July. We hypothesize that morphology was more strongly related to surface temperature in the fall months due to lake turnover during that season. This study suggests that satellite derived thermal data may be useful for calculation of lake heat budgets and evaporation rates, provided surface temperatures are measured in well-mixed lakes.

Our results provide a detailed bathymetric map of the fjord complex around the island of Skjoldungen in Skjoldungen Fjord and the outer part of Timmiarmiut Fjord and show far greater depths compared to the International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean. The hydrography collected shows different properties in the fjords with the bottom water masses below 240m in Timmiarmiut Fjord being 1-2 degrees C warmer than in the two fjords around Skjoldungen, but data also illustrate the influence of sills on the exchange of deeper water masses within fjords. Moreover, evidence of subglacial discharge in Timmiarmiut Fjord, which is consistent with satellite observations of ice melange set into motion, adds to our increasing understanding of the distribution of subglacial meltwater.

Heat transport in the Red Lake Bog, Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												We report the results of an investigation on the processes controlling heat transport in peat under a large bog in the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands. For 2 years, starting in July 1998, we recorded temperature at 12 depth intervals from 0 to 400 cm within a vertical peat profile at the crest of the bog at sub-daily intervals. We also recorded air temperature I m above the peat surface. We calculate a peat thermal conductivity of 0.5 W m(-1)degrees C(-1) and model vertical heat transport through the peat using the SUTRA model. The model was calibrated to the first year of data, and then evaluated against the second year of collected heat data. The model results suggest that advective pore-water flow is not necessary to transport heat within the peat profile and most of the heat is transferred by thermal conduction alone in these waterlogged soils. In the spring season, a zero-curtain effect controls the transport of heat through shallow depths of the peat. Changes in local climate and the resulting changes in thermal transport still may cause non-linear feedbacks in methane emissions related to the generation of methane deeper within the peat profile as regional temperatures increase.

The calculated values of temperature coefficient Q10 for the same temperature intervals differed markedly in the acute experiments and upon adaptation to temperature. In the temperature interval 6.4 to 1.6.degree. Q10 for the acute experiments and upon adaptation to temperature were 2.12 and 5.30, respectively. A sharp decrease of metabolism in winter was noted, which is accounted for by the marked decrease of the intensity of feeding and by the necessity of utilization of the internal reserves.																			0044-4596						1979	40	5					740	745																WOS:A1979HP46000011

Chlorophyll and PP at optimum light were low in the smallest and largest lakes and increased systematically to values nearly five times higher in midsized lakes (approximately 10(3) ha). Daily PP per square metre of lake surface and annual PP per cubic metre of the mixed layer also varied in this manner, but annual PP per square metre was high in large lakes (despite their low density rates) because of their long growing seasons. Additional data are needed to determine whether the photosynthesis maximum in midsized lakes is inherently size related or an accidental statistical result. Intraannually, chlorophyll-based photosynthesis parameters (P(m)B, alpha(B)) were similar in all lake sizes, but interannually they varied by two to three times; this interannual variation was significantly correlated with total rainfall during May and June. Implications for extrapolating experimental results from small to large lakes, selecting lakes for interregional comparison studies, and predicting how climatic warming would affect phytoplankton photosynthesis are discussed.																			0706-652X					DEC	1992	49	12					2445	2459		10.1139/f92-270	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f92-270													WOS:A1992KL53200002

(Eurasian watermilfoil). Aqueous endothall concentrations were below the minimum detectable level of 0.002 mg/L within 72 hr after treatment and below the minimum detectable level in sediments (0.01 mg/kg) within 96 hr. Both dilution and biodegradation probably contributed significantly to rapid transport and degradation. Endothall was not detected in fish tissue on any sampling day. Concentrations considerably less than the label-recommended dose rate for partial surface treatment were measured, indicating that AQUATHOL may be used in sensitive aquatic environments with minimal nontarget effects.																			0090-4341	1432-0703				MAR	1988	17	2					195	199		10.1007/BF01056025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01056025													WOS:A1988L787300009

Monthly fish samplings (October 2014-September 2015) were conducted in Vistonis Lake in northern Greece, a peculiar ecosystem with brackish waters in its southern part and high salinity fluctuations in its northern part. Fish gills and liver responses to the changes of the physico-chemical parameters were tested biochemically and histologically. Heat shock protein levels appeared to be correlated with salinity fluctuations, indicating the adaptation of A. vistonicus to the particular environment. The latter is also enhanced by increased Na+-K+ ATPase levels, in response to salinity increase during summer. The highest mitogen activated protein kinases phosphorylation levels were observed along with the maximum mean salinity values. A variety of histological lesions were also detected in the majority of the gill samples, without however securing salinity as the sole stress factor. A. vistonicus cellular stress responses are versatile and shifting according to the examined tissue, biomarker and season, in order for this species to adapt to its shifting habitat.					; Mouchlianitis, Foivos/ACW-8055-2022; Antonopoulou, Efthimia/N-4233-2015; Berillis, Panagiotis/H-4826-2019; Feidantsis, Konstantinos/IWM-6962-2023	Tsakoumis, Emmanouil/0000-0002-7166-3202; Feidantsis, Konstantinos/0000-0001-7606-0024; Mouchlianitis, Foivos/0000-0003-3050-0877; Berillis, Panagiotis/0000-0001-5072-2245; Tsoulia, Thomais/0000-0001-8419-8656; Antonopoulou, Efthimia/0000-0003-4565-6962; Bobori, Dimitra/0000-0003-0414-5963; 														2076-3417				NOV	2021	11	22							11021	10.3390/app112211021	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app112211021													WOS:000778205300056

Their morphology is similar to modern crayfish burrows, and this demonstrates that burrowing behavior was established early in the evolution of this group. The new discoveries show that the earliest Permian crayfish were distributed in high paleolatitudes of southernmost Pangea, where they lived in freshwater lakes fed by glacial meltwater. Modern crayfish habitat, used as a guide to crayfish temperature tolerance, indicates that summer temperatures of streams and lakes mar the South Pole that supported the crayfish probably reached 10-20 degrees C during Permian-Triassic interglacial intervals.

In many modeling studies, microzooplankton has been either entirely neglected, or else, data were often not available for validation, or agreement between the observed and the simulated abundances was rather poor. In this study, we compare the simulation results from several alternative models considering different formulations of ciliate growth in a hydrodynamically driven 1D nutrient-phytoplankton-multiple zooplankton model, with long-term datasets from the deep, monomictic Lake Constance. We show that the parameterization of the limitation of ciliate growth with a constant specific mortality rate and/or predation by copepods leads to uncontrolled ciliate blooms. In contrast, implementation of a density-dependent mortality rate enables reproduction of algae-ciliate dynamics over a variety of environmental settings encompassed by the 14-year dataset spanning 21 years in a lake undergoing oligotrophication. Considering the numerous processes that can be responsible for the dampening of ciliate blooms, our findings suggest that employing a simple density-dependent mortality term offers a pragmatic solution for the challenge of including the microzooplankton, characterized by an overwhelming complexity of trophic interactions, in ecosystem models.					; Straile, Dietmar/A-4065-2008; Kerimoglu, Onur/E-4953-2013	Kerimoglu, Onur/0000-0003-4289-4404; Straile, Dietmar/0000-0002-7441-8552; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2014	731	1					173	189		10.1007/s10750-013-1551-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-013-1551-4													WOS:000334493700013

C for 8 weeks. For both size classes, ration (grams of food per fish per day) increased with temperature. Instantaneous growth (percent body weight per day) was best at 20-30.degree. C. In the small size class it was higher at 30.degree. C than at 20-25.degree. C. Conversion efficiency results were highest at 10-30.degree. C and 15-25.degree. C for the small and large size classes, respectively. Relative to seasonal water temperatures in Lake Opinicon [Ontario Canada], the period of greatest expected growth was June to September. Instantaneous growth (percent total length per day) was high from June to August in the field population. Times of greatest prey biomass, however, were in May and September. Despite the times of maximum temperature and growth not coinciding with that of greatest prey abundance, the field growth rates were comparable to laboratory values. This suggested that food was not limiting in Lake Opinicon and that the brown bullheads achieved their potential growth relative to length of the growth season.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1985	63	6					1510	1515		10.1139/z85-224	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z85-224													WOS:A1985AMX1900042
J	Mccarthy, KP; Destefano, S				Mccarthy, Kyle P.; Destefano, Stephen			Effects of Spatial Disturbance on Common Loon Nest Site Selection and Territory Success	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The common loon (Gavia immer) breeds during the summer on northern lakes and water bodies that are also often desirable areas for aquatic recreation and human habitation. In northern New England, we assessed how the spatial nature of disturbance affects common loon nest site selection and territory success. We found through classification and regression analysis that distance to and density of disturbance factors can be used to classify observed nest site locations versus random points, suggesting that these factors affect loon nest site selection (model 1: Correct classification = 75%, null = 50%, K = 0.507, P < 0.001; model 2: Correct classification = 78%, null 50%, K = 0.551, P < 0.001). However, in an exploratory analysis, we were unable to show a relation between spatial disturbance variables and breeding success (P = 0.595, R(2) = 0.436), possibly because breeding success was so low during the breeding seasons of 2007-2008. We suggest that by selecting nest site locations that avoid disturbance factors, loons thereby limit the effect that disturbance will have on their breeding success. Still, disturbance may force loons to use sub-optimal nesting habitat, limiting the available number of territories, and overall productivity. We advise that management efforts focus on limiting disturbance factors to allow breeding pairs access to the best nesting territories, relieving disturbance pressures that may force sub-optimal nest placement.

The intensity of photosynthesis of these filaments was studied. The plankton was collected with a "Dzhedi" [JD] (large model) system closing net made of No. 70 silk sieve with a vertical catch. The samples taken were washed into clean half-liter bottles. After careful stirring, small (about 110 ml.) bottles with ground stoppers of white Jena glass were filled with the concentrated suspension of plankton obtained. Half of the bottles were placed in a light-impermeable sac and all were lowered in a special support at a depth of 0.5 where they were exposed for 1 or 2 days. After exposure O2 in the water of the bottles was determined by the Winkler method. The number of dead M. baicalensis cells at the time of the experiment amounted to not more than 20-25% of their total number, and, as a rule, increased somewhat with depth. A single day series of observations was made 9-10 July 1963 in bright, calm weather, with algal samples taken from various depths to 300 m. Observations in 22-25 July 1963 were made during a heavy fog throughout the exposure period, with algae taken from depths to 500. Results of the tests indicate that M. baicalensis retains viability down to 500 m. On 9 July, the intensity of photosynthesis of M. baicalensis, taken from a depth of more than 100 m, was approximately the same as the values found in March-April 1950. On 22-24 July the intensity of photosynthesis of Melosira taken from the same depths was approximately half as great, which may be due to the considerably reduced illumination during these days, but which may also have been associated with the high concentration of algae in the experimental vessels. The maximaum concentration of algae in the experiments was observed in the superficial layer. The intensity of photosynthesis of Melosira from 0-5-m layer was considerably lower than in that extracted from greater depths. This was apparently associated with its reduced viability at the end of vegetation. Thus, at the end of spring and the beginning of summer, when there is some rise in the temperature of the superficial layers of water in Lake Baikal, the mass dying off of M. baicalensis does not occur at all. The bulk of its cells (up to 80-75%) drop to greater depths of Lake Baikal, of the order of 500 m, and, possibly, even to the bottom, in a viable state, retaining the capacity to photosynthesize when placed in a zone of illumination.																			0002-3264						1964	155	3					673	+																WOS:A19649744A00062

We evaluated variations in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE), an indicator of fish biomass, across orthogonal gradients of light extinction and mean depth in 16 small Swedish lakes (mean depth 1.7-4.8 m, surface area 1-10 ha). Multiple regression coefficients indicated that the effect of light extinction on CPUE was negative, and that the relationship was more negative for deeper lakes than it was for shallower lakes. The pattern was strongest for lakes with mean depths between 2.1 m and 3.5 m. We estimated that 26% of small lakes in boreal Sweden fall within this mean depth range. These results contribute to the growing understanding of how variations in water color and lake morphometry influence patterns of fish biomass across the boreal landscape.

Comparative characteristics of the lipid status of gills of juvenile Atlantic salmon infected with glochidia of the freshwater pearl mussel living in rivers of the European North	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												A comparative study of the lipid status of gills of juvenile Atlantic salmon infested with glochidia of the freshwater pearl mussel inhabiting the Vuokinyoki (White Sea basin) and Syuskyuyanyoki (basin of Lake Ladoga) rivers in the fall is carried out. The most infested gills of juvenile salmon and the lower water temperature (1.3 degrees C) in the Vuokinyoki River reveal higher cholesterol levels and cholesterol/phospholipids ratios, which are due to the influence of infection factors; thereby they slow down biochemical processes. It is noted that variations in the lipid composition in juvenile salmon the gills of which are infected with glochidia reflect the development of adaptive responses that maintain homeostasis of juveniles under invasion.

J	Grote, T; Suriano, Z				Grote, Todd; Suriano, Zachary			Temporal and spatial patterns of hydroclimate variability related to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation in Michigan, USA	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Teleconnections play an influential role in driving atmospheric circulation and hydroclimatic variability at regional and global scales. While hydroclimatic conditions are associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) throughout North America, to date there has been limited study on the influence of the PDO on the hydroclimate of Michigan. Using statistical analyses, this study quantified the mean monthly streamflow, precipitation and temperature characteristics in climate divisions and stream gage stations in both the Upper and Lower Peninsulas of Michigan during the warm (+) and cool (-) phases of the PDO from 1967 to 2018. Streamflow is greater statewide during PDO+ phases compared to during PDO- phases, and most prominent from August to February. During the peak month of streamflow difference by PDO phase, November, there was a streamflow increase of nearly 26% during PDO+ phases compared to the long-term mean. In relation, mean monthly precipitation increased (decreased) statewide from August to November during PDO+ (PDO-) phases, with decreased (increased) monthly precipitation from December to July. This study advances our understanding of the PDO's influence on hydroclimatic variability in Michigan, presenting novel results at intra-seasonal scales in this highly impactful and populated region.

Modeling Past and Future Acidification of Swedish Lakes	AMBIO												Decades of acid deposition have caused acidification of lakes in Sweden. Here we use data for 3000 lakes to run the acidification model MAGIC and estimate historical and future acidification. The results indicate that beginning in about 1920 a progressively larger number of lakes in Sweden fell into the category of "not naturally acidified" (a dagger pH > 0.4). The peak in acidification was reached about 1985; since then many lakes have recovered in response to lower levels of acid deposition. Further recovery from acidification will occur by the year 2030 given implementation of agreed legislation for emissions of sulphur (S) and nitrogen (N) in Europe. But the number of catchments with soils being depleted in base cations will increase slightly. MAGIC-reconstructed history of acidification of lakes in Sweden agrees well with information on fish populations. Future acidification of Swedish lakes can be influenced by climate change as well as changes in forest harvest practices.

J	Kleeberg, A				Kleeberg, A			Phosphorus sedimentation in seasonal anoxic Lake Scharmutzel, NE germany	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The seasonal course of phosphorus (P) fractions of sinking particulate matter has been studied at the deepest location of dimictic eutrophic Lake Scharmutzel (29.5 m) by paired sediment traps at 9 and 27 m water depth from May 1996 to December 1997. Relatively large depositional fluxes and considerably variable P fluxes, mainly carried by allochthonous particles, diatoms in spring, and iron during overturns transport almost 60% of the average water column P pool to the sediment surface. The contribution of resuspension and sediment focusing (24-34%) is relatively small. A sequential chemical P extraction of the matter entrapped revealed that ,loosely adsorbed` P contributed to 5-14%, organic bound P to 55-68%, and Ca-associated P to 3-6% of the annual P flux, depending on season and depth. The redox-sensitive (iron bound) P ranged from only 12% of the annual P flux during anoxic sulfidic conditions to 28% during oxic conditions. On an annual basis, 16-18% of sedimenting P was recycled within the water column, and 71-75% of total primary P flux was recycled at the sediment surface. Ultimately, 10-23% of P became incorporated into recent sediments indicating the long residence time for P and a high internal resupply of P for primary production.																			0018-8158					MAR	2002	472	1-3					53	65		10.1023/A:1016356714276	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1016356714276													WOS:000176811800007

Here we report an alkenone-based summer temperature record over the past -12,000 years, in addition to two updated alkenone records, from Northwest China, providing new insights into the climatic status right after the event. Our results indicate that exceptional terrestrial warmth, up to -6 degrees C, occurred around 4200-2800 years ago during the Bronze Age, superimposed on the long-term Holocene cooling trend. The exceptional warmth in Northwest China, together with other climate anomalies elsewhere, suggests an unusual large-scale climatic reorganization at 4200-2800 years ago when solar activity remained high, with important implications to the climate background for cultural developments during the Bronze Age.

Zsd may vary across lakes globally, driven by natural and human activities (climate, land use/land cover, lake morphological characteristics, etc.). Based on Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) imagery, we explored the driving factors of Zsd spatiotemporal patterns in lakes across Eastern China (including the Northeast Plain and Mountain Lake (NPML) Zone and the Eastern Plain Lake (EPL) Zone). Spatially, the responses of driving factors were assessed using feature importance and partial dependence in the random forest model. The results showed that the impacts of natural factors on the spatial variations of Zsd (accounting for 52.00 % of contributions) are comparable to that of human activities (accounting for 48.00 % of contributions). The dynamic sediment ratio (DSR = the square root of the surface area divided by the average depth) showed the highest impact (accounting for 19.64 % of contributions). Thus, small lakes have relatively small DSR indices, making them less susceptible to wind-and wave-induced sediment resuspension, leading to higher Zsd than large lakes. Seasonally, the variations could be linked with the East Asian monsoon climate, characterized by hot and rainy summers. Moreover, the month with the highest Zsd was postponed from June-July in EPL lakes (south) to August-September in NPML lakes (north), consistent with the movement of the rainfall belt of the East Asian monsoon. This study could facilitate the knowledge of water quality in Eastern China as well as other developed areas and provide support for the sustainable development and management of lakes.

We identified several highly represented, putative eukaryotic, circular, single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viral genomes. Among these, we discovered a genotype similar in both sequence and genomic architecture to a virus previously reported from a hyperthermal lake that shares characteristics of both single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) and single-stranded DNA viruses. We used quantitative polymerase chain reactions to study the prevalence and viral load of both positive-sense and negative-sense strands of the Daphnia mendotae-associated (Cladocera) hybrid virus (DMClaHV) over a summer season in Oneida and Cayuga lakes. DMClaHV had high prevalence within Daphnia populations, where viral load and the proportion of virus-positive individuals were higher preceding host population decline. DMClaHV viral load was different between two species of Daphnia (D. mendotae and D. retrocurva), and the dynamics between viruses and their hosts varied between the two lakes. We detected DMClaHV in eggs (ephippia) retrieved from Oneida Lake sediments with an estimated age of 30 yr. Using transmission electron microscopy, we observed small (20 nm diameter) virus-like particles in Daphnia that were well away from gut tissues and not associated with intracellular parasites. Because Daphnia plays a critical role in many lake ecosystems, DMClaHV may have important effects on herbivory and thus carbon flow through the lake ecosystem.

Flow velocities and suspended matter concentrations decreased severely, causing an increased transparency of the watercolumn. In the eastern and northern compartments, the previously pronounced seasonal variation disappeared. Reduction of the freshwater load and decreasing nutrient concentrations in the adjacent North Sea coastal waters resulted in lower nitrite + nitrate and silicate concentrations. Autumn phosphate concentrations remained at the same level as before the nutrient reduction. Silicate was a limiting nutrient during the pre-barrier period and nitrogen and silicate were limiting during the post-barrier period. Annual patterns in chlorophyll-a concentrations in the western and central compartments showed no obvious trend; in the eastern and northern compartments higher values were measured from 1985 onwards. Primary production during the period 1980-1990 varied between 176 and 550 g C M-2 yr-1. The annual primary production in the western compartment had decreased, while in the central and eastern compartments annual primary production did not change: the formerly existing gradient disappeared. In the northern compartment higher chlorophyll-a concentrations and high annual production suggest that the phytoplankton could benefit from the increased transparency while nutrient concentrations were still high enough to support phytoplankton growth. Changes in photosynthetic physiological parameters were observed which suggested shade adaptation. This is in contrast to improved light conditions and reduced nutrient availability. The apparent incoherence with light-shade adaptation theory may be explained by the species shift that occurred. As a result of the opposite effects of a more favourable light climate and a reduced nutrient availability, together with the resulting species shift, the annual primary production showed a large degree of ho meostasis.

Species composition and places of development of blood-sucking midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) in the subzone of the southern taiga of the Tyumen region	UKRAINIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Materials are presented on the study of the development of preimaginal phases and the place of brood of blood-sucking slugs in the subzone of the southern taiga of the Tyumen region. Currently, it is relevant to study the fauna of the slimy, as they are carriers of a number of infectious and invasive diseases of animals and humans. The purpose of our studies is to study the breeding sites of blood-sucking slopes of the subzone of the southern taiga of the Tyumen region and factors affecting their abundance. We conducted a series of counts in three different types of saplings: the lowering of the microrelief in the boggy meadow, the creek of the stream and the reservoir of artificial origin, overgrown with sedge to reveal the number of larvae in the soil. The places of development of the preimaginal phases of the slimy are found in 6 types: lakes, rivers, streams, unstable water bodies, marshes and marshy meadows. As a result of the studies, 10 species of slugs adapted to different biotopes were identified. The level of preimaginal phases of mackerel is determined by the meteorological conditions that developed during the summer seasons.

TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL SHIFTS IN HABITAT USE BY BLACK BRANT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING FLIGHTLESS MOLT	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												Each year thousands of Pacific Black Brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) undergo flightless wing molt in the Teshekpuk Lake Special Area (TLSA), Alaska, in two distinct habitats: inland, freshwater lakes and coastal, brackish wetlands. Brant lose body mass during wing molt and likely must add reserves upon regaining flight to help fuel their 2,500 km migration to autumn staging areas. We characterized movements and habitat use by Brant during post-molt (the period immediately following the recovery of flight) by (1) marking individual Brant with GPS (global positioning system) transmitters, and (2) conducting a series of replicate aerial surveys. Individuals molting in inland habitats promptly abandoned their molt wetland during the post-molt and moved into coastal habitats. Consequently, inland habitats were nearly deserted by early August when Brant had regained flight, a decrease of >5,000 individuals from the flightless period of early July. Conversely, coastal molting Brant largely remained in coastal habitats during the post-molt and many coastal wetlands were occupied by large flocks (>1,000 birds). Our results indicate that inland, freshwater wetlands were less suitable post-molt habitats for Brant, while coastal wetlands were preferred as they transitioned from flightless molt. The immediacy with which Brant vacated inland habitats upon regaining flight suggests that food may be limiting during molt and they are not selecting inland molt sites strictly for food resources, but rather a balance of factors including predator avoidance and acquisition of protein for feather growth. Our data clearly demonstrate that patterns of habitat use by Brant in the TLSA change over the course of the molt season, an important consideration for management of future resource development activities in this area.

The model integrates field chemical and ecological data with results from laboratory toxicological experiments. Frequent spring depressions of pH to below 5.0, measured in the littoral zone of Plastic Lake during 1982, were predicted to cause a mortality of 35.2% to a theoretically constructed amphipod population. A time trend simulation suggested that population decline of H. azteca in similar anthropogenically acidified lakes could be caused by such direct mortality due to short-term pH fluctuations. Assumptions and factors not considered by the model which could exacerbate or mitigate the effects of acidic snowmelt to H. azteca are discussed.						france, robert/0000-0002-9171-8426													0706-652X	1205-7533				JUN	1987	44	6					1112	1121		10.1139/f87-134	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f87-134													WOS:A1987J496900002

In this study, arsenic concentrations were found to be below detection limits in natural river water, although the high background concentrations of HCO3- and the pH all favor arsenic release. Lake water had the highest arsenic concentrations due to intense evaporation. The impact of mining on arsenic release was assessed using a mixing model composed of three end-members: KS02 (a post-mining sample), R07 (a river water sample), and S12 (spring water that contains arsenic). The results indicated that mining operations are likely responsible for a small proportion (2.0%) of direct release of arsenic from deep thermal water, and that most arsenic was released by desorption from Fe oxyhydroxides. The mixing model also revealed that so far, mining operations have accelerated carbonate dissolution, but have not led to arsenopyrite oxidation. Therefore, HCO3- concentrations increased during mining, which along with the pH (> 7.0), led to desorption of arsenic from Fe oxyhydroxide.

Assimilation of satellite images into a sediment transport model of Lake Michigan	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												In this paper we develop and examine several schemes for combining daily images obtained from the Sea-viewing Wide Field Spectrometer (SeaWiFS) with a two-dimensional sediment transport model of Lake Michigan. We consider two data assimilation methods, direct insertion and a kriging-based approach, and perform a forecasting study focused on a 2-month period in spring 1998 when a large storm caused substantial amounts of sediment resuspension and horizontal sediment transport in the lake. By beginning with the simplest possible forecast method and sequentially adding complexity we are able to assess the improvements offered by combining the satellite data with the numerical model. In our application, we find that data assimilation schemes that include both the data and the lake dynamics improve forecast root mean square error by 40% over purely model-based approaches and by 20% over purely data-based approaches.

J	Medina-Sánchez, JM; Villar-Argaiz, M; Carrillo, P				Medina-Sánchez, JM; Villar-Argaiz, M; Carrillo, P			Modulation of the bacterial response to spectral solar radiation by algae and limiting nutrients	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The response of bacterial production (measured as [H-3]TdR incorporation rate) to spectral solar radiation was quantified experimentally in an oligotrophic high-mountain lake over 2 years. Bacterial responses were consistent: ultraviolet-B (UVB) was harmful, whereas ultraviolet-A (UVA) + photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and PAR enhanced bacterial activity. Full sunlight exerted a net stimulatory effect on bacterial activity in mid-summer but a net inhibitory effect towards the end of the ice-free period. 2. Experiments were undertaken to examine whether the bacterial response pattern depended on the presence of algae and or was modulated by the availability of a limiting inorganic nutrient (phosphorus, P). In the absence of algae, [H-3] TdR incorporation rates were significantly lower than when algae were present under all light treatments, and the consistent bacterial response was lost. This suggests that the bacterial response to spectral solar radiation depends on fresh-C released from algae, which determines the net stimulatory outcome of damage and repair in mid-summer. 3. In the absence of algae, UVB radiation inhibited bacteria when they were strongly P-deficient (mean values of N : P ratio: 46.1), whereas it exerted no direct effect on bacterial activity when they were not P-limited. 4. P-enrichment of lake water markedly altered the response of bacteria to spectral solar radiation at the end of ice-free period, when bacteria were strongly P-deficient. Phosphorus enrichment suppressed the inhibitory effect of full sunlight that was observed in October, both in whole lake water (i.e. including algae) and in the absence of algae. This indicates that the bacterial P-deficiency, measured as the cellular N : P ratio, was partly responsible for the net inhibitory effect of full sunlight, implying a high bacterial vulnerability to UVB.

J	Kinder, K				Kinder, Kimberley			Planning by intermediaries: making cities make nature in Amsterdam	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A												This analysis of urban wetland restoration in the Netherlands examines how theories of distributed agency are changing the way planners approach city-building tasks. Illusions of a static, prehuman nature are falling by the wayside, and the negative environmental consequences of urban expansion are gaining notoriety. Green Design strategies that, among other things, espouse bringing nature back into the city alleviate many problems. But ecoconscious planners working on Amsterdam's IJburg neighborhood have set their sights higher by attempting to turn cities into nature's womb. And instead of making this nature directly through nurseries and fisheries, planners are instead working to create a field of action that will spontaneously create wild nature at a considerable distance from planners' hands. In reviewing these experiments, this paper shows how planners marshal lake currents, plant spores, and flying birds alongside bulldozers and cranes to build homes and make wetlands.																			0308-518X					OCT	2011	43	10					2435	2451		10.1068/a4464	http://dx.doi.org/10.1068/a4464													WOS:000298067700013

Therefore, various relaxation methods for the outdoor thermal environment are often planned, e.g. utilizing of the cooling effect of a water face, arrangement of water permeable material, planting trees etc. In this paper, a coupled simulation of CFD and radiation transfer is conducted in order to evaluate the outdoor thermal environment in riverside detached single houses near to Tokyo in Japan. The effects of various relaxation methods in summer described above are estimated from the results of this simulation. Furthermore, an optimum design of the outdoor thermal environment for the Lake Town is studied.

Establishing irrigation potential of a hillside aquifer in the African highlands	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Feeding 9 billion people in 2050 will require sustainable development of all water resources, both surface and subsurface. Yet, little is known about the irrigation potential of hillside shallow aquifers in many highland settings in sub-Saharan Africa that are being considered for providing irrigation water during the dry monsoon phase for smallholder farmers. Information on the shallow groundwater being available in space and time on sloping lands might aid in increasing food production in the dry monsoon phase. Therefore, the research objective of this work is to estimate potential groundwater storage as a potential source of irrigation water for hillside aquifers where lateral subsurface flow is dominant. The research was carried out in the Robit Bata experimental watershed in the Lake Tana basin which is typical of many undulating watersheds in the Ethiopian highlands. Farmers have excavated more than 300 hand dug wells for irrigation. We used 42 of these wells to monitor water table fluctuation from April 16, 2014 to December 2015. Precipitation and runoff data were recorded for the same period. The temporal groundwater storage was estimated using two methods: one based on the water balance with rainfall as input and baseflow and evaporative losses leaving the watershed as outputs; the second based on the observed rise and fall of water levels in wells. We found that maximum groundwater storage was at the end of the rain phase in September after which it decreased linearly until the middle of December due to short groundwater retention times. In the remaining part of the dry season period, only wells located close to faults contained water. Thus, without additional water sources, sloping lands can only be used for significant irrigation inputs during the first 3 months out of the 8 months long dry season.					; Schmitter, Petra/C-8086-2014; Tilahun, Seifu/ABE-2501-2020; Atanaw, Fasikaw/AGL-4262-2022; Schmitter, Petra/R-6278-2019	Tilahun, Seifu/0000-0002-5219-4527; Schmitter, Petra/0000-0002-3826-7224; Barron, Jennie/0000-0002-3292-3438; steenhuis, tammo/0000-0003-0508-9350													0885-6087	1099-1085				APR 15	2020	34	8					1741	1753		10.1002/hyp.13659	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13659		FEB 2020											WOS:000511762300001

Flow prediction in high altitude ungauged catchments: A case study in the Italian Alps (Pantano Basin, Adamello Group)	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES					Workshop on New Frontiers of Hydrology	JUL, 2009	Rome, ITALY	Natl Res Council (CNPq), Sapienza Univ, Princeton Univ				We develop a simple model to evaluate the daily flow discharges in the ablation season for the 11 km(2) Pantano basin in the Retiche Italian Alps, based upon the data gathered during a three years field campaign. The Pantano basin embeds the Venerocolo debris covered and the Avio debris free glaciers, covering 2.14 km(2) in the Adamello Group, where the widest Italian glacier Adamello is located. First, degree-day models based upon air temperature are tuned to calculate snow and ice melt at daily scale. Glaciers' meteorological data are collected from an automatic weather station (AWS), operating on the glacier during summer 2007. The melt factors in the debris covered areas of the glacier are estimated against debris thickness, using a data driven parameterization. The flow discharge from the catchment is estimated using semi distributed flow routing for the ablation seasons of four years, from 2006 to 2009. The predicted discharges are compared to those derived from inverse reservoir's routing at the Benedetto lake, catching the basin outflow. The proposed approach is valuable as a tool to investigate the hydrology of poorly gauged glacierized areas, including those with debris covered ice, widely diffused and yet poorly understood. Pending accurate parameterization the approach is usable for water resources evaluation and for long term assessment of the climate change impact on the glacierized areas within the Alps.

In our study, two cases of HCD were analyzed; both of them were reported in people swimming in Lake Pluszne. In the summer of 2018, a sample of 397 snails was collected at swimming sites in that area. Five Lymnaea stagnalis (1.9%) were found to host cercariae of bird schistosomes. Positive samples were selected by amplification of the Internal Transcribed Spacers (ITS) gene region. Sequence analysis confirmed that they were homologous with European isolates of Trichobilharzia szidati. The cases reported in this article are the first confirmed cases of HCD in this lake. This study demonstrates that there is a rationale for conducting screening studies of regions with a high recreational potential.

Historical simulations of three intense TCs making landfall in Pearl River Delta (PRD) were first conducted using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The same cases were then re-simulated by superimposing near- (2015-2039) and far- (2075-2099) future temperature and humidity changes onto the background climate; these changes were derived from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) multi-model projections according to the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario. Peak intensities of TCs (maximum surface wind in their lifetimes) are expected to increase by similar to (3) 10% in the (near) far future. Further experiments indicate that surface warming alone acts to intensify TCs by enhancing sea surface heat flux, while warmer atmosphere acts in the opposite way by increasing the stability. In the far future, associated storm surges are also estimated to increase by about 8.5%, computed by the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model. Combined with sea level rise and estimated land vertical displacement, TC-induced storm tide affecting PRD will increase by similar to 1m in the future 2075-2099 period.

The effects of plant growth, water C:N:P ratio and their interaction on microbial diversity in the rhizosphere were studied in synthetic wastewater in planted and unplanted wetlands during three different seasons. The physiological profile of microbial community-level in each wetland was assessed using substrate utilization patterns gathered via BIOLOG (TM) ECO plates. Plant had a significant effect on AWCD parameter, since the planted wetlands usually had a higher the total microbial activity than the unplanted over the study period. The Shannon, Simpson and McIntosh indices in the planted wetlands were apparently higher than those in the unplanted wetlands under any C:N:P ratio influent condition especially in summer. It was also shown that the unplanted wetlands have a greater shift of the interstitial microbial community than the planted at different seasons, since plant rhizospheres produce a more ecologically stable system in order to resist against shifts in microbial community composition in response to C:N:P ratio change in wastewater. Principal component analysis and clustering analysis indicated that influent C:N:P ratio would induce similar microbial species in the planted wetlands and detach them from the unplanted wetlands.

J	Morris, K; Bailey, PCE; Boon, PI; Hughes, L				Morris, Kay; Bailey, Paul C. E.; Boon, Paul I.; Hughes, Leesa			Effects of plant harvesting and nutrient enrichment on phytoplankton community structure in a shallow urban lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The utility of shallow water bodies in urban environments is frequently compromised either by dense beds of submerged plants or cyanobacterial blooms associated with nutrient enrichment. Although submerged plants are often harvested to facilitate recreational uses, this activity may alter the phytoplankton community, which in turn, also may restrict the use of the lake. We tested whether (i) plant harvesting reduced the abundance of flagellate algae and increased the abundance of cyanobacteria, and (ii) whether increasing levels of nutrient enrichment caused shifts in the dominance of heterocytous cyanobacteria, non-heterocytous cyanobacteria and Chlorophyta, in a shallow urban lake in Southern Australia as has been observed for shallow Danish lakes in previous studies. These predictions were tested with large (3000 1), replicated mesocosms in a warm, highly productive, shallow lake densely colonised by the submerged angiosperm, Vallisnaria americana Michaux. The heterokont algae, Chlorophyta, Cyanobacteria and Cryptophyta were the most numerous algal divisions in the lake. The Euglenophyta, although uncommon in early summer, became more abundant towards the end of summer. The Dinophyta and Charophyta were rare. The abundance of the heterokont algae and Euglenophyta was significantly reduced by plant harvesting even after plants had partially re-established 18 weeks after initial harvesting. The decline in the Euglenophyta in response to plant harvesting is consistent with earlier findings, that the relative abundance of flagellate algae tends to be greater in the presence of submerged plants. Contrary to our prediction, we found that the Cyanobacteria did not increase in response to plant harvesting, however the response may be altered under higher nutrient levels. Algal responses to nutrient enrichment in the presence of dense V. americana plants generally followed the patterns observed in shallow Danish lakes despite the large differences in climatic conditions. Both studies found that the abundance of heterocytous cyanobacteria declined at higher levels of nutrient enrichment, whereas non-heterocytous cyanobacteria and chlorophytes increased.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2006	571						77	91		10.1007/s10750-006-0230-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0230-0													WOS:000240308500006

Spatial and temporal trends in zooplankton assemblages along a nearshore to offshore transect in southeastern Lake Michigan from 2007 to 2012	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Zooplankton were collected at a nearshore (15 m depth), a mid-depth (45 m) and an offshore site (110 m) near Muskegon, Michigan during March-December in 2007-2012. On a volumetric basis, biomass was lower at the nearshore site relative to the mid-depth site, but overall biomass at the nearshore and offshore sites did not differ. Differences in zooplankton assemblages among sites were due largely to Diaptomidae, Limnocalanus macrurus, Daphnia galeata mendotae, Cyclops, and either Bosmina longirostris or Bythotrephes longimanus. Diaptomidae were the most abundant group, accounting for 56-66% of zooplankton biomass across sites. Herbivorous cladocerans accounted for 14-22% of zooplankton biomass across sites, with B. longirostris dominant at the nearshore site and D. g. mendotae dominant at the mid-depth and offshore sites. Bythotrephes was the most abundant predatory cladoceran at all sites although, at the nearshore site, it was only abundant in the fall. There was a higher percentage of large-bodied zooplankton groups in the offshore and mid-depth zones relative to the nearshore zone. Declines in zooplankton biomass relative to the 1970s have occurred across all sites. In addition to seasonal variation within a site, we noted annual variation, especially at the offshore site, with the zooplankton assemblage during 2007-2008 differing from that found in 2010-2012 due to increases in D. g. mendotae and Cyclops and decreases in B. longimanus and L. macrurus in 2010-2012.

This study aimed at assessing the impact of management options on sustainable water allocation in environmentally sensitive catchments of Mubuku and Sebwe of Lake Edward-George basin in Western Uganda. We used hydro-meteorological data analysis techniques to quantify the available water. We applied Mike Hydro model to allocate water to the different ongoing developments in the catchment based on 2015 and 2040 water demand management scenarios. We used the Nile Basin Decision Support System to assess the sustainability of the different water management scenarios for sustainable water resources use. Reliability computation did not consider hydropower in this study. Results show that water available in 2015 was 60 MCM/YR and 365 MCM/YR for Sebwe and Mubuku, respectively and is projected to decrease by 15% and 11% by the year 2040 under climate scenario RCP8.5. We project water demand to rise by 64% for domestic, 44% for livestock, 400% for industry, 45% for hydro power and 66% for irrigation by 2040. Mubuku water demand is projected to increase from 5.2 MCM in 2015 to 10.7 MCM in 2040. Mubuku available water is projected to fall from 364.8 to 329.8 MCM per annum. Sebwe water demand is projected to increase from 9.7 MCM in 2015 to 22.2 MCM in 2040 and its available water is projected to fall from 60 to 52 MCM per annum by the year 2040 from 2015. Water managers ought to allocate water based on the reliable water allocation which prioritizes domestic and environmental water demands, allocates 90% of industrial demand, 70% of irrigation and 60% of livestock demand. We recommend institutionalizing this model to guide water allocation in the Mubuku-Sebwe sub catchments. Water users should employ more efficient water use techniques to achieve high reliability and sustainable water resources management.					; Mwanjalolo, Majaliwa/Y-6651-2019	Gabiri, Geofrey/0000-0001-7855-1476; Mwebaze, Caroline Ednah/0000-0003-0800-5220														2073-4441				AUG	2021	13	15							2009	10.3390/w13152009	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13152009													WOS:000682286300001

In cold regions the existence of ice is very common in rivers and lakes during the winter. Even with underwater intakes their presence becomes a problem when supercooling appears. Frazil ice grows rapidly and adhere to the grids coming to clog the pipe systems that feed facilities such as hydroelectric power plants, factories or even municipal supplies. This phenomenon leads to severe problems, even resulting in the closure of the plant affected. This paper presents a review on the main aspects of this problem in certain industries and an analysis of its causes and possible solutions as well as an analysis of use cases.

Pollen record reflected the dynamics of vertical vegetation zones and temperature change. Spectral analysis on pollen percentages/concentrations of Pinus and Quercus, and a temperature proxy, revealed similar to 500-year quasi-periodic cold-warm fluctuations during the past 5350 years. This similar to 500-year cyclic climate change occurred in EA during the mid-late Holocene and even the last 150 years dominated by anthropogenic forcing. It was almost in phase with a similar to 500-year periodic change in solar activity and Greenland temperature change, suggesting that similar to 500-year small variations in solar output played a prominent role in the mid-late Holocene climate dynamics in EA, linked to high latitude climate system. Its last warm phase might terminate in the next several decades to enter another similar to 250-year cool phase, and thus this future centennial cyclic temperature minimum could partially slow down man-made global warming.

J	de Boer, WF; Rydberg, L; Saide, V				de Boer, WF; Rydberg, L; Saide, V			Tides, tidal currents and their effects on the intertidal ecosystem of the southern bay, Inhaca Island, Mozambique	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Sediment characteristics and tidal currents were studied in the 1500 ha intertidal area south of Inhaca Island, Mozambique. The tide is semi-diurnal with a range at spring of about 3 m. The area connects directly to the ocean through the Ponta Torres Strait and (indirectly) through several narrow tidal channels ending up in Maputo Bay. Velocities of up to 0.75 m s(-1) were measured in the Ponta Torres strait. After Low Water, Indian ocean water starts entering the tidal flats, while entrance from the Maputo Bay side is delayed by one to several hours. With only one tide gauge and one current meter at hand, we found indications of a higher mean sea level on the oceanic side (probably due to ocean wave set up) and a mean flow in the Ponta Torres Strait directed towards Maputo Bay. A storm from the SW had a particularly strong influence on the sea level of Maputo Bay, and for a period of a few days the current flowed constantly towards Maputo Bay. Measurements in the innermost Saco channel indicated higher velocities during ebb than during flood. The resulting residual current will increase sedimentation in the bay, a process which is confirmed by aerial photographs and could be linked to the sanding of the coral reefs and the mangrove extension in the area. Extensive sandbanks are situated around both inlets as a result of the higher current velocities in these areas, thereby inhibiting the settlement of finer sediments and organic matter. Where the two flows meet, formation of mudflats and seagrass beds are favoured. Mudflats are found mainly below High Water Neap, exposed only during spring tides. This longer inundation period favours the settlement of finer material and organic matter. The area and location of the substrates have great influence on the richness and abundance of the benthic fauna, as grainsize and organic matter have been correlated with richness and abundance in other studies.																			0018-8158					JUN 15	2000	428	1-3					187	196		10.1023/A:1004030605474	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004030605474													WOS:000088580200013

The results showed an allelopathic effect related to flowers: Germination of L. sativa was inhibited 30% by throughfall, 60% by stemflow, and 75% by soil percolates during the blossoming of A. dealbata, while radicle growth of L. sativa was inhibited 23%, 33%, and 48% by the same solutions. Climatic factors, particularly rainfall some days before, were also important. The three types of samples showed significant toxicities during some periods of the year, particularly percolates, which retained toxicity for a longer time, due perhaps to the decomposition of flowers fallen on the ground.					; Reigosa Roger, Manuel Joaquin/K-3551-2013; Reigosa, Manuel/K-3551-2013	Carballeira Ocana, Alejo/0000-0002-5250-4185; Reigosa Roger, Manuel Joaquin/0000-0003-0527-1849; 													0006-8063					JAN	1999	40	1					87	92																WOS:000078478800010

We estimate Bayesian Holt-Winters state-space models for each CFS priority level. Using a novel dataset that combines data from the Salt Lake City Police Department's staffing and Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) systems at the daily level over seven years, we estimate the effects that staffing, overtime, call volume, and the level of proactive work (e.g., traffic stops, pedestrian stops, business checks) have on police response times. Our findings indicate that the impact of staffing on response times is significantly greater than that of other independent variables in the models. Furthermore, improvements in response times for higher-priority (i.e., more serious) CFS have a lower elasticity response to increases in staffing levels. As police agencies face increasingly complex challenges, the empirical evidence presented herein serves as a cornerstone for making informed decisions in the intricate balancing act of resources, officer well-being, and public safety priorities.

Another sample was collected from a hot spring on the shore of the soda lake, Magadi, in Kenya. Microbial cultures were enriched from Pakistani samples. Phylogenetic analysis of isolates was carried out by sequencing 16S rRNA genes. Genomic DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using integron gene-cassette-specific primers. Different gene-cassette-linked genes were recovered from the cultured strains related to Halomonas magadiensis, Virgibacillus halodenitrificans, and Yania flava and from the uncultured environmental DNA sample.

Geochemical processes affecting glacial meltwater composition with time and distance from the source glaciers include solute acquisition by soil salt leaching and solute concentrations by evaporation. Evaporation in the marginal lake melt and in isolated saline ponds appears to increase the Mg/Ca ratio of these meltwaters relative to that of meltwater streams. With progressive evaporation gypsum and calcite may precipitate, leading to the development of Na-Cl and Na-HCO3 brine ponds. These ponds may be vertically stratified with respect to temperature and salinity if they experience partial or complete freezing over the winter season. The chemical characteristics and nutrient concentrations of meltwaters in the Victoria Valley are similar to those of other drainage systems in the region, although the Ca-Cl brines reported from the Wright Valley immediately to the south were not observed. Trace element (Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, Mn and Fe) concentrations measured in the lakes and large ponds do not show any evidence of unusual enrichment in the drainage.

The sub-till lacustrine units are up to 120 cm thick, of which the upper several decimeters frequently contain thick, layered mats of aquatic moss; pollen and diatoms are common throughout both lacustrine units. A series of 23 AMS C-14 dates defines the chronology of the postglacial sequence, which records a succession from a pioneer grass- and Oxyria-dominated tundra between 10.4 and 8 ka BP, to a sedge-dominated tundra after 8 ka BP. Limiting C-14 dates place the sub-till lacustrine sediments more than 40 ka BP; 10 luminescence dates centered on 85 ka indicate they were deposited late in oxygen isotope stage (OIS) 5. The dominance of shrub and tree pollen, especially shrub birch and alder, in sub-till lacustrine samples, indicates low-arctic tundra farther north than at any time during the Holocene. Pollen concentrations are comparable to or higher than in the Holocene units. Cooling late in the interglacial is indicated by declining birch and alder pollen percentages in the upper part of the section. Diatom floras in both the sub-till and postglacial lacustrine sequences indicate similar development of lake-water chemistry, but input of silica and weathering products was greater in the older lake cycle, suggesting more vigorous catchment processes. Macrofossils in the sub-till units are characteristic of lakes ice-free in summer. Based on pollen assemblages indicating local and regional vegetation diagnostic of summer temperatures higher than the Holocene, we interpret the sub-till lacustrine units to be of interglacial character. By analogy with Holocene plant succession in central and eastern Canada, all of Keewatin and Labrador/Ungava must have been ice free throughout this interval, suggesting essentially complete deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet at the time.

Effect of evaporative weathering and oil-sediment interactions on the fate and behavior of diluted bitumen in marine environments. Part 1. Spill-related properties, oil buoyancy, and oil-particulate aggregates characterization	CHEMOSPHERE												The fate and behavior of diluted bitumen spilled in marine conditions has recently become a topic of much interest, yet, only limited knowledge is available. One of the major issues of a diluted bitumen spill on water is whether the product will sink, especially when suspended sediment is present in the water column. This study demonstrated how weathering processes influenced the key spill-related properties of a diluted bitumen product (Cold Lake Blend-Winter), and how interaction of diluted bitumen with sediment affected its tendency to float or sink in water. This study showed that the weathering states of the oils as well as the size of sediment are important factors influencing oil-sediment interactions and the tendency of the formed oil-particulate aggregates for buoyancy. When mixing with fine- and medium-sized sediments, the fresh to moderately weathered oils formed oil-particulate aggregates and sank in saltwater, while the very heavily-weathered oil formed discrete free-floating tarballs.

Estimates of CH4 emissions from the Mozhaysk reservoir (Moscow region) provided by the model showed good agreement with instrumental in situ observations for several parameters of the water ecosystem. The average CH4 flux calculated by the model is 37.7 mgC-CH4 m-2 day-1, while according to observations, it is 34.4 mgC-CH4 m-2 day-1. Ebullition makes the largest contribution to the emissions from reservoirs (up to 95%) due to low methane solubility in water and the high oxidation rate of diffusive methane flux. During the heating period, an increase in methane emission is observed both in the model and empirical data, with a maximum before the onset of the autumn overturn. An effective parameter for calibrating the diffusive methane flux in the model is the potential rate of methane oxidation. For ebullition flux, it is the parameter q10 (an empirical parameter determining the relationship between methane generation and temperature) because methane production in bottom sediments is the most important. The results of this research can be used to develop mechanistic models and provide a necessary step toward regional and global simulations of lacustrine methane emission using LAKE2.3.

J	Ghafarian, P				Ghafarian, Parvin			Impact of physical parameterizations on simulation of the Caspian Sea lake-effect snow	DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS												The southwestern coast of the Caspian Sea often experiences heavy snowfall during winter season due to the lake effect. The accurate estimation of snowfall in this region is still a challenge for weather forecasters. This study attempts to investigate the simulation of lake-effect snow (LES) event occurring along the southwest coastline of the Caspian Sea from 31 January to 4 February 2014 using Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The study evaluates the sensitivity of four microphysics (WSM6, Goddard, Morrison, and Thompson) schemes and two planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes (the Yonsei University (YSU) and the Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ)), yielding eight distinct combinations. The results indicated that all the simulations overestimated the precipitation. However, the best configurations for estimation of precipitation and snow in terms of their spatiotemporal variation were the Morrison-MYJ and the Goddard-MYJ, respectively. Analyses of the vertical profiles of hydrometeor species showed that the combination of Goddard and MYJ schemes created more snow and graupel than the other configurations. Although the combination of WSM-MYJ schemes revealed the least bias, it was not appropriate for the prediction of snow. A comparison of the two boundary layer schemes showed that the MYJ scheme simulated better intensity and distribution of precipitation than the YSU scheme compared to observations. Also, the maximum radar reflectivity of the model output was useful for identifying the location of maximum precipitation.					ghafarian, parvin/AAT-9828-2021														0377-0265	1872-6879				JUN	2021	94								101219	10.1016/j.dynatmoce.2021.101219	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dynatmoce.2021.101219		MAR 2021											WOS:000658609400007
J	HADAS, O; PINKAS, R				HADAS, O; PINKAS, R			SULFATE REDUCTION IN THE HYPOLIMNION AND SEDIMENTS OF LAKE KINNERET, ISRAEL	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Lake Kinneret is a warm (13-30 degrees C) monomictic lake. Between January and June a heavy annual bloom of the dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense dominates phytoplankton biomass (250 g m(-2)). At the beginning of the summer, degradation and decomposition of the Peridinium biomass occurs, serving as a trigger for intense sulphate reduction in the hypolimnion and sediments. 2. The rates of sulphate reduction in the sediments varied seasonally from 12 to 1700 nmol SO4-2 reduced cm(-3)day(-1) in December and July, respectively. The availability of organic matter and sulphate is high in June after the crash of the Peridinium bloom and the beginning of stratification and is lowest in December before overturn. 3. Sulphate concentrations in the hypolimnion range between 0.52 mM and 0.20 mM during mixing (January-April) and before overturn (December), respectively. The depletion in sulphate in the hypolimnion is stoichiometrically correlated to the increase in sulphide. The lake is not depleted of sulphate at any time, so the sulphate reduction process in Lake Kinneret is not limited by sulphate concentrations except in the sediments just before overturn.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				FEB	1995	33	1					63	72		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1995.tb00386.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1995.tb00386.x													WOS:A1995QH47800006

This study proposes a new method for identifying effects of land on satellite remote sensing of water quality. The new optical water types (OWT) containing the land-affected signal were derived from POLYMER-corrected imagery of the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer in reduced resolution (MERIS RR) and Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). These were then applied, as part of a larger set of existing OWTs corresponding to the variability observed in natural waters, to satellite images. The ability to identify pixels containing both water and land, and those contaminated with radiance from adjacent land, was evaluated. Our test sites include dark lakes of varying size in Sweden (Lakes Rusken, Bolmen, Ringsjo center dot n, and Ivo center dot sjo center dot n) where the classification showed high sensitivity to land near the lake shore. The land-affected signal is shown to lead to underestimations of chlorophyll-a concentration and Forel-Ule colour indices, and overestimations of turbidity in these lakes, which can be corrected after masking out the land-affected pixels. The land-affected signal is strongest in summer, both NDVI and sun zenith angle covaried with the seasonal variation of land-affected signal. Further, the results confirmed that satellite images with coarser spatial resolution are more prone to land-affected signal compared to images with finer spatial resolution, for small inland water bodies. We propose a data-driven approach for water quality processing with 'land-affected water types' as an effective way to improve the lake optical water quality monitoring from water colour sensors.					; Hunter, Peter/B-8010-2008; Liu, Xiaohan/AGS-6555-2022; Simis, Stefan/B-1703-2008; Tyler, Andrew/F-2034-2010	Simis, Stefan/0000-0002-6296-9146; Spyrakos, Evangelos/0000-0001-7970-5211; Jiang, Dalin/0000-0001-5676-5860; 													1569-8432	1872-826X				MAR	2023	117								103188	10.1016/j.jag.2023.103188	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2023.103188		JAN 2023											WOS:000920647800001

To study the interplay between lake drainage, glacier movement and crevasse activity, high-frequency seismometers and GPS receivers were deployed in networks near Gornersee during the summer ablation seasons of 2004, 2006 and 2007. We use a Rayleigh wave coherence method to locate 3289, 7939 and 4087 icequakes, respectively, primarily along well-defined surface crevasses. We calculate two-dimensional strains from triads of GPS stations and find mean differential strain rates of similar to 300 x 10(-6) d(-1) with diurnal variations up to 800 x 10(-6) d(-1). Crevasse icequake activity and glacial velocity are highest during early season, then decrease as meltwater channels erode and subglacial water pressure decreases. Glacial response to Gornersee drainage varied year-to-year, with icequake activity promoted at some crevasses and inhibited at others, suggesting syn-drainage icequakes may be indicative of local drainage patterns and small-scale features of the stress field. Diurnal pulses in icequake activity exhibit peak activity at different times of day in different locations, coincident with a southeast-to-northwest trending concentrated shear zone near the Gornergletscher-Grenzgletscher confluence, likely due to differences in the timing of peak strain rate in these regions.

J	Yunker, MB; Backus, SM; Graf Pannatier, E; Jeffries, DS; Macdonald, RW				Yunker, MB; Backus, SM; Graf Pannatier, E; Jeffries, DS; Macdonald, RW			Sources and significance of alkane and PAH hydrocarbons in Canadian arctic rivers	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Hydrocarbon measurements have been made on dissolved, suspended particulate and sediment samples collected in 1987, 1993 and 1994 from the Mackenzie River delta and shelf and in 1993 from 10 smaller Northwest Territories and Nunavut rivers that drain into the Canadian Archipelago or Hudson's Bay. Suspended particulate samples from all rivers have a resolved higher alkane pattern with a well-defined odd-even predominance consistent with a major source in terrestrial, vascular plant material. Particulate samples from the 10 smaller rivers have alkane concentrations that are similar to the Mackenzie River during summer, but PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) concentrations are approximately 10 times lower for the parent PAHs and 100 times lower for alkyl PAHs. PAHs on suspended particulate from the Mackenzie River exhibit a uniform composition typical of mature petrogenic sources, while PAHs in the smaller rivers are typical of combustion. The virtual absence of petrogenic PAHs in the smaller rivers is the single most important difference between these and the Mackenzie River. During summer the alkane and PAH composition of suspended particulate in the Mackenzie River is sufficiently homogenous to estimate directly the hydrocarbon load from the particulate load. Mackenzie River particulates and sediments have the hopane and sterane ratios characteristic of immature bitumens, shales or coals from the Devonian Canol formation that outcrops in the lower Mackenzie River valley. The erosion of organic-rich rocks from this formation is likely the source of the refractory petrogenic material found in the Mackenzie River delta and shelf. Data are insufficient to determine whether the petrogenic lower alkanes and PAHs have the same source or whether more mature petroleum also contributes. Because sediment samples (suspended and bed) from the Mackenzie delta have natural PAH concentrations that exceed the level where adverse biological effects are expected to occur, there is an urgent need to establish whether these petroleum-derived PAHs are bioavailable and if they are inducing effects in bottom fish-and other biota.

Habitat selection of a migratory freshwater fish in response to seasonal hypoxia as revealed by acoustic telemetry	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Adaptive efforts to achieve water quality objectives by modifying nutrient loading can have attendant impacts on fish habitats and fisheries. Thus, coordinating fishery and water quality management depends on knowledge of fish behavioral responses to habitat change. This study combined acoustic telemetry of fish with water quality modeling to understand how water quality management might impact fishery management. We examined habitat use of a native demersal fish, lake whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis, in Lake Erie. We focused on the summer stratified period when habitat was expected to be most limiting and used a forecast model to predict temperature and oxygen in the hypolimnion when fish were detected. As hypothesized, lake whitefish occupied a subset of available conditions with occupied habitats characterized by a cool, normoxic, hypolimnion. On some occasions fish were detected when the hypolimnion was predicted to be hypoxic, suggesting that fish were either displaced vertically or horizontally into marginal habitats or uncertainty in model predictions was high. Still, when hypolimnetic conditions were hypoxic, fish tended to move toward normoxia as expected, but when initial conditions were cold with high dissolved oxygen, fish movements were toward lower oxygen (but still normoxic) conditions. We also observed a high affinity for fish to remain near the southern shore in eastern Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. If current nutrient reduction objectives are achieved and the extent and severity of hypoxia is reduced, an expansion of lake whitefish habitat and distribution may have significance to the spatial regulation of fishing effort in Lake Erie.

In this study, a Froude-Rossby scaled physical model of Lake Ontario, North America, is used to support numerical simulations. Experimental data are consistent with available field observations and provide a more comprehensive view of lake-wide features that include, in the absence of wind, strong eastward flows along both northern and southern shorelines, a large cyclonic gyre in the Rochester basin, and smaller midlake cyclonic eddies. With a west wind (most common direction), a well-defined westward flow in the middle of the lake separates an anticyclonic gyre in the north from a cyclonic gyre in the south. A review of numerical models shows that most models can capture general features of these observed patterns but do not always reproduce all details, especially in nearshore regions. A numerical model based on the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC), with a 200-m resolution in nearshore regions, is developed.					; Zhu, Zhenduo/I-2736-2017; hui, yuan/KEH-5562-2024	HUI, YUAN/0000-0002-2227-1384; Farnham, David J./0000-0002-6690-4251; Zhu, Zhenduo/0000-0002-7711-7632; 													0733-9429	1943-7900				AUG 1	2021	147	8							05021004	10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0001908	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0001908													WOS:000667318200010

The so-called Grande del Nevado del Plomo glacier, periodically produces a surge and an ice dam that confines the Plomo river valley and forms a glacier-dammed lake. The outflow of the ice dam and the routing of flood waves down-valley are studied by means of hydrologic and hydraulic mathematical simulation for the purposes of flood-wave forecasting, the operation of a real-time hydrologic alert system, and determination of inundation maps, as well as the study of the impact on diversion dams, bridges, roads, and railroads along the river.																			0733-9429					JAN	1991	117	1					42	53		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(1991)117:1(42)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(1991)117:1(42)													WOS:A1991EP95400003

The use of virtual reality in environment experiences and the importance of realism	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Introduction: Virtual reality (VR) can be extremely useful in simulating nature when physical presence is not possible. Additionally, it allows for environments to be customised (e.g., weather, or topography) and facilitates the design of controlled experimental settings. However, VR can involve the use of expensive equipment and complex software to create highly realistic immersive experiences. But is it necessary for experiences to rival the latest Hollywood blockbuster? This paper explores whether such investment can be valuable in research on nature experiences. Studies: Two studies were conducted to examine how realism of environmental presentations impact affective responses and participant perceptions. Study One (n = 16) explored perceptions of the same lake presented to participants in the real world, in VR and as a video. Study Two (n = 120) compared participant's affective responses to one of four possible virtual environments differing in level of realism (high or low) and type (natural or built). Results: Study One showed that experiences of VR presentations fell between real and video presentations. Study Two found that more realistic VR environments evoked more positive affective and serenity responses, as well as a greater sense of presence. In both studies, participants stressed the importance of naturalistic interaction, sensory immersion, and graphical realism in the experiences, which may help explain these effects. Conclusion: The level of realism that can be attained with VR does impact affective responses and perceptions. Investment in VR for future research can be highly beneficial.

The lake is used as drinking water, for recreation and fishing. During 1 year, water samples were taken at 23 points in the bay and three contamination sources: a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), a river and a storm water outlet. Analyses included Escherichia coli, enterococci (ENT), total coliforms (TC), and heterotrophic plate counts (HPC). E. coli input flux rates from the WWTP can reach 2.5 x 10(10) CFU/s; those from the river are one to three orders of magnitude lower. Different pathogenic Salmonella serotypes were identified in water from these sources. FIB levels in the bay are highly variable. Results demonstrate that (1) the WWTP outlet at 30 m depth impacts near-surface water quality during holomixis in winter; (2) when the lake is stratified, the effluent water is generally trapped below the thermocline; (3) during major floods, upwelling across the thermocline may occur; (4) the river permanently contributes to contamination, mainly near the river mouth and during floods, when the storm water outlet contributes additionally; (5) the lowest FIB levels in the near-surface water occur during low-flow periods in the bathing season.

Spatial changes in the abundance of hepatotoxin microcystin-producing and non-microcystin producing Microcystis populations were investigated in the lake in August of 2009 and 2010. To monitor the densities of the total Microcystis population and the potential microcystin-producing subpopulation, we used a quantitative real-time PCR assay targeting the phycocyanin intergenic spacer (PC-IGS) and the microcystin synthetase gene (mcyD), respectively. On the basis of quantification by real-time PCR analysis, the abundance of potential toxic Microcystis genotypes and the ratio of the mcyD subpopulation to the total Microcystis varied significantly, from 4.08x10(4) to 5.22x10(7) copies/mL, from 5.7% to 65.8%, respectively. Correlation analysis showed a strong positive relationship between chlorophyll-a, toxic Microcystis and total Microcystis; the abundance of toxic Microcystis correlated positively with total phosphorus and ortho-phosphate concentrations, but negatively with TN:TP ratio and nitrate concentrations. Meanwhile the proportion of potential toxic genotypes within Microcystis population showed positive correlation with total phosphorus and ortho-phosphate concentrations. Our data suggest that increased phosphorus loading may be a significant factor promoting the occurrence of toxic Microcystis bloom in Lake Taihu.					yu, yang/HIZ-9682-2022														1001-0742	1878-7320					2012	24	2					284	290		10.1016/S1001-0742(11)60745-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(11)60745-6								22655389					WOS:000300653300015

MARBLED MURRELET BRACHYRAMPHUS MARMORATUS USE OF A FRESHWATER LAKE ON VANCOUVER ISLAND, BRITISH COLUMBIA, 2018-2023	MARINE ORNITHOLOGY												Marbled Murrelets Brachyramphus marmoratus are small seabirds widely distributed in nearshore waters on the west coast of North America, from Alaska to central California. A 1986 review of anecdotal records revealed that Marbled Murrelets use coastal freshwater lakes during the breeding season, possibly to forage, and in winter, possibly while prospecting for nest sites in old-growth forest. Our weekly surveys and observations on Sproat Lake (central Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada) from November 2018 to March 2023, confirmed yearround use by murrelets, with absences during the prealternate molt (beginning mid-March) and the prebasic molt (August and September), when the birds were probably at sea. Putative pairs predominated in all months, which suggests mated adults; single murrelets were recorded infrequently when pairs would have been separated during incubation. Murrelets were not observed holding prey, and fledglings were not recorded on the lake. The emerging importance of freshwater lakes and their watersheds as an aspect of Marbled Murrelet life history requires further research, particularly in light of this species' possible sensitivity to human recreational and other disturbances when using lakes. Identification of recurring use of freshwater lakes, such as Sproat Lake, by Marbled Murrelets could inform conservation actions directed toward potential nesting habitat in nearby old-growth forests.																			1018-3337	2074-1235				APR	2024	52	1					97	104																WOS:001232001800020

Coupling Automated Radon and Carbon Dioxide Measurements in Coastal Waters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Groundwater discharge could be a major, but as yet poorly constrained, source of carbon dioxide to lakes, wetlands, rivers, estuaries, and coastal waters. We demonstrate how coupled radon (Rn-222, a natural groundwater tracer) and pCO(2) measurements in water can be easily performed using commercially available gas analysers. Portable, automated radon and pCO(2) gas analysers were connected in series and a closed air loop was established with gas equilibration devices (GED). We experimentally assessed the advantages and disadvantages of six GED.. Response times shorter than 30 min for Rn-222 and 5 min for pCO(2) were achieved Field trials revealed significant positive correlations between Rn-222 and pCO(2) in estuarine waterways and in a mangrove tidal creek, implying that submarine groundwater discharge was a source of CO2 to surface water. The described system can provide high resolution, high precision concentrations of both radon and pCO(2) with nearly no additional effort compared to measuring only one of these. gases. Coupling automated Rn-222 and pCO(2) measurements can provide new insights into how groundwater seepage contributes to aquatic carbon budgets.

J	Poszig, D; Theberge, JB				Poszig, D; Theberge, JB			Gray Wolf, Canis lupus lycaon, responses to shifts of White-tailed Deer, Odocoileus virginianus, adjacent to Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												Changes in the distribution of White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus) affected the distribution of Gray Wolves (Canis lupus lycaon) within and adjacent to the Round Lake deer yard in central Ontario. This prompted us to re-examine the anti-predator benefits of yarding for deer. The distribution of deer and wolves in the study area, and locations of deer kills were documented in four periods over the winter. Road and forest deer track counts, infrared monitoring at deer migration routes, and wolf radio tracking techniques were the main methods employed. As snow depth increased, deer distribution changed from a loose aggregation in late January to a more clumped distribution in March. Three wolf packs had their territories partially or fully within the deer yard and 13 radio-collared migratory wolves and their pack mates in seven packs, left their territories in the park and followed the deer to the concentration area, resulting in a high density of wolves during the winter. The majority of wolves responded to the shifting deer distribution by staying in areas of high deer density within the yard and its periphery, and 21 of 27 kill-sites found were located in these areas. The loose aggregation of mostly small deer groups in the Round Lake deer yard meant that enhanced predator detection as well as increased confusion of the predator during an attack presumably were minor factors contributing to greater safety in the yard. As a result of the aggregation of migratory and resident wolves in the yard, the ratio of predator to prey was not lowered as it may be in other cases. Except for the possibility of enhanced escape using the trail network, there appears to be little evidence for anti-predator benefits of yarding for deer in the Round Lake deer yard.																			0008-3550					JAN-MAR	2000	114	1					62	71																WOS:000086104000006

Recordings of the lidar and CALIPSO both show that dry salt particles can be found in the atmospheric boundary layer over the lake especially in summer times.

Recent applications of spatially-explicit models have used an arbitrary spatial scale and have assumed a fixed foraging efficiency. We evaluated the effects of spatial scale, predator foraging efficiency (combined probabilities of prey recognition, attack, capture, and ingestion), and predator spatial distribution on estimates of mean growth rate potential of chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha. We used actual data on prey densities and water temperatures taken from Lake Ontario during the summer, as well as, simulated data assuming binomial distribution of prey. Results show that a predator can compensate for low foraging efficiency by inhabiting the most profitable environments (regions of high growth rate potential). Differences exist in predictions of growth rate potential across spatial scales of observation and a single scale may not be adequate for interpreting model results across seasons. Continued refinements of this modeling approach must focus on the assumptions of stationary distributions of predator and prey populations and predator foraging tactics.					; Mason, Doran/ABF-1415-2020	Mason, Doran/0000-0002-6017-4243; 													0378-1909					MAR	1996	45	3					283	298		10.1007/BF00003098	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00003098													WOS:A1996TZ51600009
J	Wang, B; Qi, QQ				Wang Bo; Qi Qianqian			Modeling the lake eutrophication stochastic ecosystem and the research of its stability	MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES												In the reality, the lake system will be disturbed by stochastic factors including the external and internal factors. By adding the additive noise and the multiplicative noise to the right-hand sides of the model equation, the additive stochastic model and the multiplicative stochastic model are established respectively in order to reduce model errors induced by the absence of some physical processes. For both the two kinds of stochastic ecosystems, the authors studied the bifurcation characteristics with the FPK equation and the Lyapunov exponent method based on the Stratonovich-Khasminiskii stochastic average principle. Results show that, for the additive stochastic model, when control parameter (i.e., nutrient loading rate) falls into the interval [0.388644, 0.66003825], there exists bistability for the ecosystem and the additive noise intensities cannot make the bifurcation point drift. In the region of the bistability, the external stochastic disturbance which is one of the main triggers causing the lake eutrophication, may make the ecosystem unstable and induce a transition. When control parameter (nutrient loading rate) falls into the interval (0, 0.388644) and (0.66003825, 1.0), there only exists a stable equilibrium state and the additive noise intensity could not change it. For the multiplicative stochastic model, there exists more complex bifurcation performance and the multiplicative ecosystem will be broken by the multiplicative noise. Also, the multiplicative noise could reduce the extent of the bistable region, ultimately, the bistable region vanishes for sufficiently large noise. What's more, both the nutrient loading rate and the multiplicative noise will make the ecosystem have a regime shift. On the other hand, for the two kinds of stochastic ecosystems, the authors also discussed the evolution of the ecological variable in detail by using the Four-stage Runge-Kutta method of strong order gamma = 1.5. The numerical method was found to be capable of effectively explaining the regime shift theory and agreed with the realistic analyze. These conclusions also confirms the two paths for the system to move from one stable state to another proposed by Beisner et al. [3], which may help understand the occurrence mechanism related to the lake eutrophication from the view point of the stochastic model and mathematical analysis.																			0025-5564	1879-3134				JUN	2018	300						102	114		10.1016/j.mbs.2018.03.019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2018.03.019								29571814					WOS:000437078500010

Slow growing char (dwarfs) had significantly higher levels of SIGMAPCB (sum of PCB congeners found) and p,p-DDE (dominating DDT-compound) than fast growing char (normals). Besides demonstrating a highly divergent growth pattern the introgressed populations also inhabit a great range of depths, and the seasonal food consumption rates may differ between extreme growth fractions, although the same major invertebrates (introduced Mysis relicta and Pallasea quadrispinosa) are consumed over the year. However, of the life history parameters differing in late spring, individual growth rate was the most important factor explaining the variation in the levels of the pollutants studied. The results support the hypothesis of a biomass ''dilution'' of pollutants in fish, illustrated by lower levels in fast growing char and higher levels in the slow-growing dwarfs. Individuals with alternative growth strategies in sympatric conspecific communities thus provide unique opportunities to study growth rate as a variable influencing levels of persistent pollutants in fish.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				DEC	1993	50	12					2574	2580		10.1139/f93-281	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f93-281													WOS:A1993NF41900006

Discovery of lake-effect clouds on Titan	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Images from instruments on Cassini as well as from telescopes on the ground reveal the presence of sporadic small-scale cloud activity in the cold late-winter north polar region of Saturn's large moon Titan. These clouds lie underneath the previously discovered uniform polar cloud attributed to a quiescent ethane cloud at similar to 40 km and appear confined to the same latitudes as those of the largest known hydrocarbon lakes at the north pole of Titan. The physical properties of these clouds suggest that they are due to methane convection and condensation. Such convection could be caused by a process in some ways analogous to terrestrial lake-effect clouds. The lakes on Titan could be a key connection between the surface and the meteorological cycle.

The major components of the underwater light field (ULF: vertical attenuation, absorption, scattering and suspensoids including plankton fractions) of Las Madres Lake, a small wind-sheltered, oligohumic lake in Central Spain, were investigated daily over a period of 3 months at the onset of vernal circulation. 2. Gilvin, arising mostly from the decomposition of reeds in the littoral in autumn, was the main component of vertical attenuation, and its variability explained the highest fraction of absorption variability. Tripton appeared to be the main factor responsible for scattering, and might have resulted from dust deposition from the surrounding mining land. The plankton community played a minor role in attenuation, absorption or scattering throughout the investigation period. 3. Vertical and horizontal mixing dynamics may control the ULF to a certain extent, as most optical properties changed within different mixing periods and poor advective exchanges may have resulted in uneven distribution of water colour in this small lake. 4. Time series analysis showed that most autocorrelations were shorter than a week, inherent properties (absorption, scattering) being delayed longer than apparent properties (attenuation, transparency) as a result of their lower dependence on solar irradiance. A 2-day lag was observed in cross-correlations between either gilvin and absorption or tripton and scattering. When different mixing periods at early circulation were considered, however, ULF components changed their relationships and delays with suspensoids and dissolved substances over such periods, probably tracking the dynamics of their controlling factors. 5. Our study, and others at daily, weekly, seasonal, interannual and long-term scales, demonstrates that ULF is a system upon which different processes are operating at different time scales. Contrary to expectations, however, the variability in the ULF does not increase with time scale and depends partly upon the trophic status of lakes.

Particularly, single weather extremes may cause changes in ice-flow velocity and terminus position. Occasionally, this can lead to substantial event-driven mass loss at the ice front. We examine changes in terminus position, ice-flow velocity, and calving flux at the grounded lacustrine Schiaparelli Glacier in the Cordillera Darwin using geo-referenced time-lapse camera images and remote sensing data (Sentinel-1) from 2015 to 2022. Lake-level records, lake discharge measurements, and a coupled energy and mass balance model provide insight into the subglacial water discharge. We use downscaled reanalysis data (ERA-5) to identify climate extremes and track land-falling atmospheric rivers to investigate the ice-dynamic response on possible atmospheric drivers.Meltwater controls seasonal variations in ice-flow velocity, with an efficient subglacial drainage system developing during the warm season and propagating up-glacier. Calving accounts for 4.2% of the ice loss. Throughout the year, warm spells, wet spells, and landfalling atmospheric rivers promote calving. The progressive thinning of the ice destabilizes the terminus position, highlighting the positive feedback between glacier thinning, near-terminus ice-flow acceleration, and calving flux.					; sauter, tobias/HSD-8208-2023; Schneider, Christoph/V-2150-2017	Werner, Niklas/0000-0002-8791-2867; Heinze, Florian/0009-0006-9212-794X; Schneider, Christoph/0000-0002-9914-3217													0022-1430	1727-5652				FEB 5	2024	70									10.1017/jog.2024.14	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jog.2024.14		FEB 2024											WOS:001174083300001

A total of nine sampling sites from upstream to downstream was explored in our study. At each site, the density of algae was identified every week during the wet season (June-October) from 2012 to 2017, and in situ detection was used for the relative 11 hydrochemical variables. The temporal and spatial characteristics of 14 variables were analyzed using a heatmap coupled with the cluster analysis method. The trend of each parameter was analyzed using the smoothing method with locally weighted regression. The nonmetric multidimensional scaling method was employed to detect the temporal and spatial similarities among algae along hydrochemical gradients. The responses of algal density to hydrochemical variables were analyzed using a redundancy analysis. The results showed that the water temperature (W-temp), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), cyanobacteria, and diatoms exhibited significant declining trends, and significant increasing trends were shown in the permanganate index, chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, and total phosphorus; the cyanobacteria exhibited certain differences with green algae and diatoms in summer and the downstream areas of the river. The temporal-spatial homogeneity of algal to hydrochemical variables showed the key influencing factors of W-temp for cyanobacteria density, chlorophyll for green algae density, DO, and pH for diatoms. The results presented here are valuable for deepening our understanding of river ecosystem evaluations and effective environmental management, as well as an important reference for the sustainable development of aquatic biological resources.

This study aims to quantify the water quality on a temporal scale in the Doorndraai dam site in sub-Saharan Africa to design possible management options. Here, an integrated approach using both in-situ measurements of water quality parameters and remote sensing data was used to derive the water quality index (WQI) and inherent optical properties of water to deduce the factors governing seasonal and annual variability. The results show that all the water quality parameters analyzed fall under the permissible limit of the World Health Organization (WHO) for drinking water, except turbidity. The average value of turbidity for the dry and wet periods was 12.52 and 3.39 NTU, respectively. WQI value ranges from good to excellent during the wet season, and poor in the dry season owing to the high values of turbidity in the water samples. Both in-situ and remote sensing-based analysis shows that during the last five years, the value of suspended particulate matter (SPM) based on Landsat-8 increased gradually in the study area. The Sentinel-2 derived modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) shows a decreasing trend in the water area due to encroachment. The strong correlation between in-situ and remote sensing data supports the usefulness of remote sensing techniques for water resource management, especially in data-scarce regions. Looking at the spatio-temporal trend of water quality evolution, the findings of this study will help local decision-makers design sustainable plans for water resource management of Doorndraai dam.					; Yunus, Ali/K-9965-2013; Huynh, Vuong Thu Minh/GYD-6908-2022; Kurniawan, Tonni Agustiono/B-8172-2008; Kharrazi, Ali/M-4097-2018; Singh, Bhupendra/JTV-4341-2023; Alshayeb, Mohammed/ACI-2349-2022; kumar, Pankaj/HPF-8395-2023; Avtar, Ram/C-7394-2012; Khedher, Khaled/AFC-9108-2022	Pulpadan, Yunus Ali/0000-0001-9545-0714; Singh, Bhupendra/0000-0002-0513-9082; Kumar, Pankaj/0000-0001-7099-7297; 													2666-0490						2022	4								100187	10.1016/j.crsust.2022.100187	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crsust.2022.100187													WOS:000903672900002
J	Anderson, L				Anderson, Lesleigh			Rocky Mountain hydroclimate: Holocene variability and the role of insolation, ENSO, and the North American Monsoon	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Over the period of instrumental records, precipitation maximum in the headwaters of the Colorado Rocky Mountains has been dominated by winter snow, with a substantial degree of interannual variability linked to Pacific ocean-atmosphere dynamics. High-elevation snowpack is an important water storage that is carefully observed in order to meet increasing water demands in the greater semi-arid region. The purpose here is to consider Rocky Mountain water trends during the Holocene when known changes in earth's energy balance were caused by precession-driven insolation variability. Changes in solar insolation are thought to have influenced the variability and intensity of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and North American Monsoon and the seasonal precipitation balance between rain and snow at upper elevations. Holocene records are presented from two high elevation lakes located in northwest Colorado that document decade-to-century scale precipitation seasonality for the past similar to 7000 years. Comparisons with sub-tropical records of ENSO indicate that the snowfall-dominated precipitation maxima developed similar to 3000 and 4000 years ago, coincident with evidence for enhanced ENSO/PDO dynamics. During the early-to-mid Holocene the records suggest a more monsoon affected precipitation regime with reduced snowpack, more rainfall, and net moisture deficits that were more severe than recent droughts. The Holocene perspective of precipitation indicates a far broader range of variability than that of the past century and highlights the non-linear character of hydroclimate in the U.S. west.

Study focus: Drought-flood alternation (DFA) is sub-seasonal precipitation anomaly, which has more serious impact on agricultural production, ecology and environment than a single drought or flood event. The study evaluated the suitability of high-resolution satellite-based precipitation product for identifying the DFA event and quantified the spatiotemporal patterns of the frequencies and intensities of DFA at various time scales. New hydrological insights for the region: The Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) product could effectively identify the DFA events at 1-month scale, with high consistency with the results based on traditional rain-gauge data, however, its performance was not very satisfactory at 3-month and 6-month scales. Drought-to-Flood (DTF) events usually occurred from March to June, while Flood-to-Drought (FTD) events mainly occurred during from July to September. Frequencies and intensities of both DTF and FTD exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity. The lake area was mainly affected by DTF events, and the Ganjiang sub-catchment was mainly affected by FTD events. Especially, the southern part of the basin was a high-risk area affected by DFA, with higher frequencies of both severe DTF and FTD events. Furthermore, although the total area affected by DFA events showed a long-term decreasing trend from 2000 to 2019, the area affected by severe DTF and FTD events was gradually expanding in Poyang Lake basin.

J	Chisnall, BL				Chisnall, BL			Habitat associations of juvenile shortfinned eels (Anguilla australis) in shallow Lake Waahi, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Small meshed G-minnow traps were used to assess the habitat associations of juvenile shortfinned eels in Lake Waahi, a shallow mesotrophic lake in the lower Waikato River basin, New Zealand. Five distinctive marginal habitats (raupo, aquatic macrophyte, reed, willow, exposed clay, and mud), and five offshore positions at various depths through the water column and distances from the margin (1-3 m and 50-500 m, respectively) were compared. Eels smaller than 400 mm were closely associated with marginal habitat. The highest catch per unit effort (CPUE) of juveniles occurred in raupo, the most complex cover. CPUE in marginal habitats declined in autumn particularly in the willows which corresponded to defoliation. Offshore sampling revealed that eels smaller than 350 mm were almost exclusively in the margins, and that larger eels were mostly offshore. Beyond 50 m from the margin, the size of eel did not change with increasing distance offshore. Eels were not caught in suspended traps (other fish were), suggesting that eels in this lake were benthic foragers. Reasons for juvenile habitat selectivity are discussed and management implications highlighted.																			0028-8330					JUN	1996	30	2					233	237																WOS:A1996VA35400008

A 1500-year record of temperature and glacial response inferred from varved Iceberg Lake, southcentral Alaska	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												We present a varve thickness chronology from glacier-dammed Iceberg Lake in the southern Alaska icefields. Radiogenic evidence confirms that laminations are annual and record continuous sediment deposition from A.D. 442 to A.D. 1998. Varve thickness is positively correlated with Northern Hemisphere temperature trends, and more strongly with a local, similar to 600 yr long tree ring width chronology. Varve thickness increases in warm summers because of higher melt, runoff, and sediment transport (as expected), but also because shrinkage of the glacier dam allows shoreline regression that concentrates sediment in the smaller lake. Varve thickness provides a sensitive record of relative changes in warm season temperatures. Relative to the entire record, temperatures implied by this chronology were lowest around A.D. 600, warm between A.D. 1000 and A.D. 1300, cooler between A.D. 1500 and A.D. 1850, and have increased dramatically since then. Combined with stratigraphic evidence that contemporary jokulhlaups (which began in 1999) are unprecedented since at least A.D. 442, this record suggests that 20th century warming is more intense, and accompanied by more extensive glacier retreat, than the Medieval Warm Period or any other time in the last 1500 yr.

However, a long-standing scarcity of high-resolution paleoclimatic records on the TP makes it unclear when the South Asian monsoon (SAM) reached the central TP. Here, we investigated the environmental magnetic properties of a lacustrine sequence (similar to 25.5-19.8 Ma) from the Lunpola Basin. Hematite is the dominant magnetic mineral with concentrations that vary with "box-shaped" peaks that mainly resulted from preferential preservation and dissolution of detrital iron oxides in alternating nonsteady state redox environments. Environmental magnetic sequences reflect distinct dry-wet cycles with a similar to 400 kyr eccentricity periodicity, which are proposed to have been driven by SAM intensity. Therefore, our study reveals that the SAM intensified and advanced northward to the Lunpola Basin by at least similar to 25.5 Ma.

A Precipitation Feature with presence of both melting layer (maximum temperature of the vertical column > 4 degrees C) and a layer of subfreezing air (2-m temperature < 0 degrees C) adjacent to the surface is considered an FRF. During 4 years of observations, GPM and Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications-2 identify approximately 3,096 FRFs globally (65 degrees S-65 degrees N). Most of them are observed over Northern Hemispheric land in the winter season. The majority of FRFs originates through the "melting process," whereas only 35 features are associated with "warm rain" process. The locations and seasonal and diurnal distribution patterns of the FRFs over the United States are well matched with the ground-based observations. The ground-based observations verify approximately 70% of the FRFs over the United States. Ku-band radar properties show that FRFs are found shallower (2-5 km) and less intense (<27 dBZ) than precipitation features in general but deeper and more intense than Snow Features. Passive microwave properties show that FRFs Tbs and Polarization-Corrected Temperature are warmer than Snow Features at all GPM Microwave Imager channels with the largest differences in 166 GHz. The enhancement in Tbs are more distinct with warm rain FRFs. FRF Tb tends to decrease as echo top height increases at all GPM Microwave Imager channels except for 183 GHz, where Tbs have lack of dependence on echo top height.					liu, chuntao/CAI-2189-2022	Adhikari, Abishek/0000-0003-2246-2997													2169-897X	2169-8996				OCT 16	2019	124	19					10385	10400		10.1029/2019JD030788	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JD030788		OCT 2019											WOS:000490112000001

Between ca. 125,000 and 73,000 yr B,P., three minimum EQF values and two intervening peaks of slightly higher EQF values are recorded. EQF increased markedly from ca. 73,000 to 13,000 yr B.P., whereas between ca. 53,000 and 20,000 yr B.P. the values recorded were relatively lower than those recorded during either the preceding or the subsequent episodes, The data imply that the East Asian winter monsoon strengthened during the periods when EQF values were high, and weakened during the intervals with low EQF values. The EQF record of Lake Biwa can be correlated with the grain-size record of the quartz fraction in Chinese loess and with the SPECMAP marine delta(18)O record, However, the EQF record apparently lags ca, 5000 yr behind the loess and delta(18)O records during stage 6/5 and 2/1 transitions and ca, 10,000 yr during stage 5/4 transition, These apparent lags could be due to problems with the chronology; alternatively, they may imply that the eolian quartz flux depended more on the extent of dust source regions than on wind intensity during these transitions.

Windows of change: temporal scale of analysis is decisive to detect ecosystem responses to climate change	MARINE BIOLOGY												Long-term ecological research has become a cornerstone of the scientific endeavour to better understand ecosystem responses to environmental change. This paper provides a perspective on how such research could be advanced. It emphasizes that a profound understanding of the mechanisms underlying these responses requires that records of ecologic processes be not only sufficiently long, but also collected at an appropriate temporal resolution. We base our argument on an overview of studies of climate impacts in limnic and marine ecosystems, suggesting that lakes and oceans respond to (short-term) weather conditions during critical time windows in the year. The observed response patterns are often time-lagged or driven by the crossing of thresholds in weather-related variables (such as water temperature and thermal stratification intensity). It becomes clear from the previous studies that average annual, seasonal or monthly climate data often fall short of characterizing the thermal dynamics that most organisms respond to. To illustrate such literature-based evidence using a concrete example, we compare 2 years of water temperature data from Muggelsee (Berlin, Germany) at multiple temporal scales (from hours to years). This comparison underlines the pitfalls of analysing data at resolutions not high enough to detect critical differences in environmental forcing. Current science initiatives that aim at improving the temporal resolution of long-term observatory data in aquatic systems will help to identify adequate timescales of analysis necessary for the understanding of ecosystem responses to climate change.

The most important food items in terms of volume were carrion and decapod crustaceans in the river, carrion and littoral benthic invertebrates in lakes and ponds containing fish, and planktonic crustaceans (Mostly Cladacera) in ponds and pools without fish. Terrestrial invertebrates, which had presumably fallen into the water, nektonic insects and whole fish were also eaten. Diet varied relatively little with turtle size and sex, although juveniles ate relatively less carrion and more littoral and benthic invertebrates than adults.

J	COMITA, GW				COMITA, GW			A STUDY OF A CALANOID COPEPOD POPULATION IN AN ARCTIC LAKE	ECOLOGY												The life cycle of Limnocalanus johanseni from a lake at Point Barrow, Alaska was studied during the summer of 1952. Duplicate plankton hauls were made during the ice-free months at time intervals that varied from 1 to 5 days using a Clarke-Bumpus plankton sampler. The instar populations were determined by counting and identifying the stages in these hauls. Hatching of the eggs was coincident with a 1[degree]C rise in water temperature, and most eggs had hatched before the large mass of ice had melted, with the result that the 1st samples contained all 6 nauplius stages. The life cycle consists of 6 nauplius and 6 copepodid stages in addition to the egg. The duration of each instar was estimated as follows: less than 4 days for nauplius stages I, n, and HI; for nauplius IV, 2 days; N V, 2.5; N VI, 5; for copepodid I, 3.5; C H, 3; C III, 4; C IV, 5; C V, 16; and C VI (adult), approx. 120 days. Sexual maturation in the adult female required 16 days or less; males required more than 16 days. Sexual reproduction occurred over 47 days or more. The means of the median lengths (mm) of all stages are: N I, 0.229; N II, 0.290; N III, 0.364; N IV, 0.434; N V, 0.575; N VI, 0.759; C I, 0.821; C II, 0.990; C HI, 1.21; C IV, 1.29; C V (male), 1.42; C V (female), 1.46; C VI (male), 1.74; C VI (female), 1.79. Growth factors between all stages were found to approximate 23 in conformity with Dyar''s law. Growth factors and chlorophyll extracts have a correlation coefficient of 0.555 at the 10% level. The adult population is bimodal with respect to size, with 74% of the adult males a mean length of 1.69 mm for, and 1.96 mm for the other 26%. For adult females 69% had a mean length of 1.69 mm, 31% a mean length of 2.06 mm. A limited food supply was offered as the explanation for this bimodality. The mortality curve for this population has the equation: log y = 3.45 - 0.00681 x. Extrapolation of this curve indicated that the population died out at the year''s end, and the lack of any free-swimming stages the following April indicated that the population wintered over in the egg stage. The regression line of log weight on length for this population is: log W = 1.19 L - 0.346. The ponderal index computed from length-weight data was found to be largest for copepodid stage V, the stage in which sexual dimorphism is first apparent.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1956	37	3					576	591		10.2307/1930182	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1930182													WOS:A1956WR62200021

While many studies have focused on remote sensing applications for monitoring long term changes in cold regions, the role of UAS for detection, monitoring, and response to rapid changes and direct exposures resulting from abrupt hazards in cold regions is in its early days. This review discusses recent applications of UAS remote sensing platforms and sensors, with a focus on observation techniques rather than post-processing approaches, for abrupt, cold region hazards including permafrost collapse and event-based thaw, flooding, snow avalanches, winter storms, erosion, and ice jams. The pilot efforts highlighted in this review demonstrate the potential capacity for UAS remote sensing to complement existing data acquisition techniques for cold region hazards. In many cases, UASs were used alongside other remote sensing techniques (e.g., satellite, airborne, terrestrial) and in situ sampling to supplement existing data or to collect additional types of data not included in existing datasets (e.g., thermal, meteorological). While the majority of UAS applications involved creation of digital elevation models or digital surface models using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry, this review describes other applications of UAS observations that help to assess risks, identify impacts, and enhance decision making. As the frequency and intensity of abrupt cold region hazards changes, it will become increasingly important to document and understand these changes to support scientific advances and hazard management. The decreasing cost and increasing accessibility of UAS technologies will create more opportunities to leverage these techniques to address current research gaps. Overcoming challenges related to implementation of new technologies, modifying operational restrictions, bridging gaps between data types and resolutions, and creating data tailored to risk communication and damage assessments will increase the potential for UAS applications to improve the understanding of risks and to reduce those risks associated with abrupt cold region hazards. In the future, cold region applications can benefit from the advances made by these early adopters who have identified exciting new avenues for advancing hazard research via innovative use of both emerging and existing sensors.

Bioaccumulation and rhizofiltration potential of Pistia stratiotes L. for mitigating water pollution in the Egyptian wetlands	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYTOREMEDIATION												The bioaccumulation and rhizofiltration potential of P. stratiotes for heavy metals were investigated to mitigate water pollution in the Egyptian wetlands. Plant and water samples were collected monthly through nine quadrats equally distributed along three sites at Al-Sero drain in Giza Province. The annual mean of the shoot biomass was 10 times that of the root. The concentrations of shoot heavy metals fell in the order: Fe < Mn < Cr < Pb < Cu < Zn < Ni < Co < Cd, while that of the roots were: Fe < Mn < Cr < Pb < Zn < Ni < Co < Cu < Cd. The bio-concentration factor (BCF) of most investigated heavy metals, except Cr and Pb, was greater than 1000, while the translocation factor (TF) of most investigated metals, except Pb and Cu, did not exceed one. The rhizofiltration potential (RP) of heavy metals was higher than 1000 for Fe, and 100 for Cr, Pb and Cu. Significant positive correlations between Fe and Cu in water with those in plant roots and leaves, respectively were recorded, which, in addition to the high BCF and RP, indicate the potential use of P. stratiotes in mitigating these toxic metals.					; Dakhil, Mohammed/U-9249-2019; Eid, Ebrahem/O-2723-2013; Galal, Tarek/AAF-7604-2019	Galal, Tarek/0000-0001-9847-1051; Dakhil, Mohammed/0000-0002-5140-1360; Eid, Ebrahem/0000-0003-2452-4469; 													1522-6514	1549-7879					2018	20	5					440	447		10.1080/15226514.2017.1365343	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2017.1365343								29053352					WOS:000429032500005

Different Influences of Bacterial Communities on Fe (III) Reduction and Phosphorus Availability in Sediments of the Cyanobacteria- and Macrophyte-Dominated Zones	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Little is known about the effects of bacterial community on iron (Fe) and phosphorus (P) cycles in sediments under different primary producer habitats in different seasons. Lake Taihu has both the cyanobacteria- and macrophyte-dominated lake zones. In this work, the abundance and structure of bacterial community was investigated using qPCR and 16S rRNA gene high throughput sequencing, respectively. Compared with the sediments in the cyanobacteria-dominated lake zone, sediments in the macrophyte-dominated lake zone had higher TP, TOC and TN contents but lower DO and Eh values. Dissolved reactive P, dissolved Fe, and their molar ratios (Fe/P) were lower in the sediments of the cyanobacteria-dominated lake zone than those in the macrophyte-dominated lake zone. Consistent with this was the significantly lower abundance of total and typical Fe redox transforming bacteria in the sediment of the cyanobacteria-dominated lake zone than those in the macrophyte-dominated lake zone. Correlation analyses also revealed positive influence of abundances of total bacteria and typical Fe reducing bacteria on dissolved Fe and Fe/P ratio. The results showed that, in the cyanobacteria-dominated open water zone, Acidimicrobiaceae was capable of Fe metabolism, contributing to higher P flux in summer. In the cyanobacteria-dominated bay, Sva0081 sediment group and Desulfobulbaceae could transform sulfate to sulfide, which resulted in the reduction of Fe (III), while in the macrophyte-dominated zones, Clostridium sensu stricto 1 could couple oxidation of organic carbon with the reduction of Fe (Ill). The present study adds new knowledge linking the bacterial communities with the physicochemical cycles of Fe and P in sediments under different primary producer habitats.					; Tsang, Dan/E-5442-2012; Ding, Ding/F-8295-2011	Tsang, Dan/0000-0002-6850-733X; 														1664-302X				NOV 14	2018	9								2636	10.3389/fmicb.2018.02636	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.02636								30487778					WOS:000450081600001

In this work, we evaluated the occurrence and the antimicrobial resistance profile of Arcobacter isolates recovered from different aquatic sources. Besides, we searched for Arcobacter spp. in seaweeds and the corresponding seawater samples. Bacteriological and molecular methods applied to 100 samples led to the isolation of 28 Arcobacter isolates from 27 samples. The highest prevalence was detected in rivers followed by artificial ponds, streams, well waters, and spring waters. Seaweeds contained a higher percentage of Arcobacter than the corresponding seawater samples. The isolates were identified as Arcobacter butzleri (96.4%) and Arcobacter cryaerophilus (3.6%). All the isolates showed a multi-drug resistance profile, being resistant to at least three different classes of antibiotics. Molecular analysis of genetic determinants responsible for tetracycline resistance in nine randomly chosen isolates revealed the presence of tetO and/or tetW. This work confirms the occurrence and the continuous emergence of antibiotic-resistant Arcobacter strains in environmental samples; also, the presence of quinolone-resistant Arcobacter spp. in aquatic sources used for water supply and irrigation represents a potential risk for human health.

Seasonal variations of virus- and nanoflagellate-mediated mortality of heterotrophic bacteria in the coastal ecosystem of subtropical western Pacific	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Since viral lysis and nanoflagellate grazing differ in their impact on the aquatic food web, it is important to assess the relative importance of both bacterial mortality factors. In this study, an adapted version of the modified dilution method was applied to simultaneously estimate the impact of both virus and nanoflagellate grazing on the mortality of heterotrophic bacteria. A series of experiments was conducted monthly from April to December 2011 and April to October 2012. The growth rates of bacteria we measured ranged from 0.078 h(-1) (April 2011) to 0.42 h(-1) (September 2011), indicating that temperature can be important in controlling the seasonal variations of bacterial growth. Furthermore, it appeared that seasonal changes in nanoflagellate grazing and viral lysis could account for 34% to 68% and 13% to 138% of the daily removal of bacterial production, respectively. We suggest that nanoflagellate grazing might play a key role in controlling bacterial biomass and might exceed the impact of viral lysis during the summer period (July to August) because of the higher abundance of nanoflagellates at that time. Viral lysis, on the other hand, was identified as the main cause of bacterial mortality between September and December. Based on these findings in this study, the seasonal variations in bacterial abundance we observed can be explained by a scenario in which both growth rates and loss rates (grazing + viral lysis) influence the dynamics of the bacteria community.

Lakes C1 and C2 contain seawater 'trapped' by isostatic uplift as the former embayments became isolated from the sea. These lakes, and Lake C3, contain varved sediments which provide an annually resolvable paleoclimatic record. By studying the major systems influencing sedimentation in one of these lakes (Lake C2) a better understanding of the climatic controls on varve formation, and hence on the paleoclimatic signal in the varved sediment record, was obtained.

James; Yamada, Yoshinori; Kawashima, Masayuki; Fujiyoshi, Yasushi			Influences of Orography and Coastal Geometry on a Transverse-Mode Sea-Effect Snowstorm over Hokkaido Island, Japan	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Sea-effect snowstorms generated over the Sea of Japan produce consistent and often heavy snowfall throughout the winter season, impacting downstream communities in northern and central Japan. Here, we use observations and Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model simulations to examine the precipitation distribution produced by transverse-mode sea-effect snowbands that interacted with the mountainous terrain circumscribing Ishikari Bay, Hokkaido Island, Japan, on 12 January 2014. The bands observed here were horizontal convective rolls aligned normal to the mean flow and were similar to 10 km wide and up to similar to 100 km long. The bands approached Ishikari Bay at intervals of similar to 10-16 min, intensifying as they progressed through a quasi-stationary, elongated enhancement region that paralleled the Shakotan Peninsula and extended into the Ishikari plain. Hydrometeor advection, through an ascent region over the northeast slope of the Shakotan Peninsula, and along clockwise-turning trajectories steered by the boundary layer directional shear, contributed to sustained precipitation enhancement along a curve in the elongated enhancement region near the entrance to Ishikari Bay. Downstream, orographic flow deflection by the coastal mountains, likely accentuated by thermal and roughness gradients along the Shakotan Peninsula's shoreline, produced convergence and ascent along the elongated enhancement region. This study demonstrates the impact of downstream topography on sea-effect snowstorms and has implications for improving the prediction of snowfall in this and other lake- and sea-effect regions.					fujiyoshi, yasushi/P-9079-2014; Kawashima, Masayuki/D-9107-2012	Campbell, Leah/0000-0001-6601-8770; Steenburgh, Jim/0000-0003-1028-4230													0027-0644	1520-0493				JUL	2018	146	7					2201	2220		10.1175/MWR-D-17-0286.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-17-0286.1													WOS:000438020200006
J	Planavsky, N; Grey, K				Planavsky, Noah; Grey, Kathleen			Stromatolite branching in the Neoproterozoic of the Centralian Superbasin, Australia: an investigation into sedimentary and microbial control of stromatolite morphology	GEOBIOLOGY												The extensive and well-preserved Neoproterozoic Acaciella australica Stromatolite assemblage of Australia is ideal for examining the relative roles of microbial and environmental influences on stromatolite branching and stromatolite macrostructure across a wide geographical area. Detailed sedimentological analyses indicate that the basal hemispheroidal section of bioherms contains abundant sediment. By contrast, the columnar sections of bioherms are composed almost exclusively of micritic laminae. These micritic laminae display little evidence for environmental, especially sedimentary, control over stromatolite morphology. The change from a hemispheroidal morphology to branching morphology is linked to variations in the relative contributions of sediment and framework growth. The shift to columns appears to be closely linked to a decrease in sediment supply that resulted in a more stable environment in which microbially mediated framework growth began to control stromatolite morphology. Branching in the A. australica assemblage stromatolites appears to be caused by shifting sedimentary and microbial control on stromatolite morphology.

We studied how transfer of important biomolecules, fatty acids, may be connected to DOC in pelagic food webs of large boreal lakes. We collected nine zooplankton taxa during three seasons from six lakes along a gradient of DOC (5-10 mg C L-1). Taxonomic identity explained 62% of the variation in zooplankton fatty acids, while the effects of DOC and season were less pronounced. This suggests that the community composition of zooplankton is important in determining the quality of food available for higher trophic level consumers. Seasonal differences in fatty acid composition were most evident in the taxa that overwinter in an active stage, and especially C18 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) accumulated toward fall. Small part of the within-taxa variation in zooplankton fatty acids was related to lake DOC concentration. However, the proportion of fatty acids indicative of bacteria or terrestrial vegetation were not linked to DOC. Instead, DOC was connected to PUFA, with zooplankton in high DOC lakes having higher 3:6 ratios. We propose that this is due to decrease of chlorophytes in phytoplankton community with increasing DOC concentration. Our results with significant among-taxa differences in zooplankton fatty acids imply that terrestrial organic matter may affect the transfer of fatty acids more profoundly if it modifies the zooplankton community composition. However, shifts in the phytoplankton community structure could also cause smaller-scale changes in zooplankton fatty acid composition.

Detecting human impacts on the flora, fauna, and summer monsoon of Pleistocene Australia	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												The moisture balance across northern and central Australia is dominated by changes in the strength of the Australian Summer Monsoon. Lake-level records that record changes in monsoon strength on orbital timescales are most consistent with a Northern Hemisphere insolation control on monsoon strength, a result consistent with recent modeling studies. A weak Holocene monsoon relative to monsoon strength 65-60 ka, despite stronger forcing, suggests a changed monsoon regime after 60 ka. Shortly after 60 ka humans colonized Australia and all of Australia's largest mammals became extinct. Between 60 and 40 ka Australian climate was similar to present and not changing rapidly. Consequently, attention has turned toward plausible human mechanisms for the extinction, with proponents for over-hunting, ecosystem change, and introduced disease. To differentiate between these options we utilize isotopic tracers of diet preserved in eggshells of two large, flightless birds to track the status of ecosystems before and after human colonization. More than 800 dated eggshells of the Australian emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae), an opportunistic, dominantly herbivorous feeder, provide a 140-kyr dietary reconstruction that reveals unprecedented reduction in the bird's food resources about 50 ka, coeval in three distant regions. These data suggest a tree/shrub savannah with occasionally rich grasslands was converted abruptly to the modern desert scrub. The diet of the heavier, extinct Genyornis newtoni, derived from >550 dated eggshells, was more restricted than in co-existing Dromaius, implying a more specialized feeding strategy. We suggest that generalist feeders, such as Dromaius, were able to adapt to a changed vegetation regime, whereas more specialized feeders, such as Genyornis, became extinct. We speculate that ecosystem collapse across arid and semi-arid zones was a consequence of systematic burning by early humans. We also suggest that altered climate feedbacks linked to changes in vegetation may have weakened the penetration of monsoon moisture into the continental interior, explaining the failure of the Holocene monsoon. Climate modeling suggests a vegetation shift may reduce monsoon rain in the interior by as much as 50%.

Little information is available on the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loss via leaching and runoff for different fertilizer types in rice-wheat agricultural systems. A field experiment was conducted to quantify and characterize the temporal dynamics of N and P loss for different fertilizer types. A rice-wheat rotation with no fertilizer (Control, CL), chemical fertilizer (CF) and organic fertilizer (OF) was conducted from 2013 to 2015 in Taihu Lake. Fertilization and precipitation resulted in varied N and P loss within and between seasons. Compared to percolation water, runoff was the dominant mechanism for N and P loss. For N loss, runoff accounted for 81-90%, 91-98% and 70-94% for CL, CF and OF, respectively. Furthermore, NH4+-N was the major form for N loss in the rice season while NO3- + NO2--N (NOx) was the major form for N loss in wheat season. Particulate P was the major form for P loss, and accounted for 65-85%, 69-85%, and 51-60% for CL, CF and OF, respectively. Further, greater downward movement of P occurred for OF but greater N for CF, resulting in reversed N and P distribution with soil depth. Compared to CF, OF reduced N loss of 19-54% but increased P loss of 45-237%. Therefore, restricted use and better management of OF such as rotating OF applications with green manure and limiting the rates of OF are strongly suggested to enhance its environmental benefits in rice-wheat system. OF brings higher income with 226439 yuan ha(-1) compared to 48885 yuan ha(-1) for CF, but lower environmental cost with 418 yuan ha(-1) compared to 538 yuan ha(-1). Those make it feasible to control non-point pollution sources adjacent to rivers and lakes.

J	WOO, MK; MCCANN, SB				WOO, MK; MCCANN, SB			CLIMATIC VARIABILITY, CLIMATIC CHANCE, RUNOFF, AND SUSPENDED SEDIMENT REGIMES IN NORTHERN CANADA	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Streamflow and sediment concentrations in northern rivers are highly variable from year to year, but the paucity of data renders it difficult to establish the norms of contemporary water and sediment discharges. With regard to suspended sediment yield, nival, proglacial, and prolacustrine regimes are recognized, depending on the sources of water and the sources and sinks of sediments in the streams. The availability of water and sediments is often asynchronous, particularly because of the presence of snow and ice in the channel and permafrost in the banks, which play both protective and enhancement roles in fluvial erosion, depending on the season. Thus, empirical relationships between sediment concentrations and streamflow may be highly tenuous. Anthropogenically induced climatic warming is likely to raise the temperature of northern winters, but the response of precipitation remains uncertain. As long as warming raises the temperature above the freezing level, rates of snow and ice melt and permafrost degradation will be accelerated, affecting future streamflows and sediment regimes. Vegetation may affect sediment yield, but the presence of lakes and wetlands will buffer against future changes. It is suggested that research on climatic change impacts should focus on the water and sediments in the channels as well as the suite of fluvial landforms in the present paraglacial and periglacial environment.																			0272-3646					MAY-JUN	1994	15	3					201	226		10.1080/02723646.1994.10642513	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02723646.1994.10642513													WOS:A1994QD51100001

The Kashmir Valley in the northwestern Himalaya, India situated at the interface of Western Disturbances and Indian Summer Monsoon moisture sources preserves undisturbed lacustrine deposits that serve as a valuable archive of past climate conditions. The spatio-temporal variability of these two monsoon moisture sources have been responsible for the Holocene climate perturbations and paleolimnological processes in the Kashmir Himalaya. The global and regional climate shifts aided by the anthropogenic forcings raises the need for a better understanding of the Holocene climate shifts and paleolimnological processes. We studied the available literature on lacustrine proxy records in order to understand the Holocene paleolimnological changes and to decipher paleoclimate, productivity and anthropogenic influences in the Kashmir valley. The analysis of the lake proxy records revealed significant changes in the regional paleoclimate conditions, lacustrine productivity and swings between drier and wetter phases. Furthermore, the region experienced a significant increase in the monsoonal precipitation during the early Holocene, followed by a progressive decline in the monsoonal rains and subsequent decreased lake water-levels and accelerated eutrophication during the late Holocene and recent times. In order to better comprehend the Holocene climate variability and its regional coherence, we compared these lake records with the regional Himalayan lakes and have elaborated about how paleolimnological processes respond to the shifting tropical-subtropical monsoon dynamics. The response of paleolimnological processes to a number of brief wet (Holocene Climate Optimum, Roman Warm Period and dry (Dark Age Cold Period and Little Ice Age) events has not been thoroughly investigated from this region, despite these events having been extensively observed from other lake systems in the Indian Himalaya. We suggest that several other lacustrine sites should be explored to generate high fidelity paleolimnology records with a stronger chronological framework to investigate the response of lacustrine processes to these short-term wet and drier phases.

Italy)	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Holo-oligomixis is one of the most important hydrodynamic characteristics of deep lakes in temperate regions, especially those of the Southern Alps. It influences such important lake chemical and biological process as the oxygenation of deep layers, recycling of nutrients, vertical migration of plankton, and reproduction, Analysis of physico-chemical data from Lago Maggiore over the years 1951-2008 has shown that in addition to ever active but relatively inefficient convective mixing, three other mechanisms act to oxygenate this lake's deep waters in winter. These are conveyor belt currents, cold and well-oxygenated tributary inflows that sink down to depths of equal density, and differential cooling of littoral waters that subsequently slide down the lake flanks. Their common outcome is to cause deep erosion of the hypolimnion. Heat content and thermal stability also are affected and are analyzed here in relation to external driving forces, examining in particular how dynamics may be altered by climate change.

Linking mineralisation process and sedimentary product in terrestrial carbonates using a solution thermodynamic approach	EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS												Determining the processes which generate terrestrial carbonate deposits (tufas, travertines and to a lesser extent associated chemical sediments such as calcretes and speleothems) is a long-standing problem. Precipitation of mineral products from solution reflects a complex combination of biological, equilibrium and kinetic processes, and the different morphologies of carbonate sediment produced by different processes have yet to be clearly demarked. Building on the groundbreaking work of previous authors, we propose that the underlying control on the processes leading to the deposition of these products can be most parsimoniously understood from the thermodynamic properties of their source solutions. Here, we report initial observations of the differences in product generated from spring and lake systems spanning a range of temperature-supersaturation space. We find that at high supersaturation, biological influences are masked by high rates of physico-chemical precipitation, and sedimentary products from these settings infrequently exhibit classic "biomediated" fabrics such as clotted micrite. Likewise, at high temperature (> 40 degrees C) exclusion of vascular plants and complex/diverse biofilms can significantly inhibit the magnitude of biomediated precipitation, again impeding the likelihood of encountering the "bio-type" fabrics. Conversely, despite the clear division in product between extensive tufa facies associations and less spatially extensive deposits such as oncoid beds, no clear division can be identified between these systems in temperature-supersaturation space. We reiterate the conclusion of previous authors, which demonstrate that this division cannot be made on the basis of physico-chemical characteristics of the solution alone. We further provide a new case study of this division from two adjacent systems in the UK, where tufa-like deposition continuous on a metre scale is happening at a site with lower supersaturation than other sites exhibiting only discontinuous (oncoidal) deposition. However, a strong microbiological division is demonstrated between these sites on the basis of suspended bacterial cell distribution, which reach a prominent maximum where tufa-like deposits are forming. We conclude that at high supersaturation, the thermodynamic properties of solutions provide a highly satisfactory means of linking process and product, raising the opportunity of identifying water characteristics from sedimentological/petrological characteristics of ancient deposits. At low supersaturation, we recommend that future research focuses on geomicrobiological processes rather than the more traditional, inorganic solution chemistry approach dominant in the past.

Spawning-related movements in a salmonid appear timed to reduce exposure to visually oriented predators	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR												Animals often exhibit extensive flexibility in movement behaviours on a range of temporal and spatial scales in response to cues that reliably predict fitness outcomes. The annual timing of movements between distinct habitats can be crucial, particularly in seasonal environments with narrow ecological windows of opportunity. In polygamous species, sexual selection may further shape sex-specific phenology and movement behaviours. Here, we characterized seasonal, daily and diel movement patterns in adult brown trout, Salmo trutta, between a lake feeding habitat and two spawning streams in northwestern Ireland, using passive integrated transponder (PIT) telemetry. Antennae positioned at the inflow and outflow of the lake were used to monitor movements of 197 lake-tagged adults between lake and stream habitats. Across 2 years in both streams, movements were overwhelmingly nocturnal and exhibited distinct seasonality, with a peak in daily detections close to the winter solstice. In both streams, seasonal movement activity of males began and peaked before that of females (protandry). Daily detection probabilities for both sexes increased as the moon waned (decreasing lunar illumination) and as river depth increased, the latter being associated with reduced water clarity. These findings are consistent with fish favouring movement between fluvial and lacustrine habitats when light (both solar and lunar) or hydrological conditions decrease their exposure to visually oriented predators. The observed protandry also suggests a role for intrasexual male competition, whereby earlier male arrival could increase mating opportunities. (C) 2020 The Authors.

The Impact of Permafrost Disturbances and Sediment Loading on the Limnological Characteristics of Two High Arctic Lakes	PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES												The physical and chemical characteristics of two High Arctic lakes were investigated at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory on Melville Island, in response to large active-layer detachments generated by extreme summer temperatures in 2007. In the two years following the permafrost disturbances, there was an elevated loading of total dissolved solids into both lakes, but no concomitant increase in suspended sediment levels. The physical dynamics of one lake were significantly altered by an internal sediment input, which was not directly related to watershed processes. The results indicate that localised permafrost disturbance in the watersheds resulted in changes to chemical conditions in these relatively deep, large lakes, while increased sediment transport from disturbances did not have a sustained impact.

Between the groups, the results differed 4 to 10-fold; the detergent-containing methods had the greater activity. Conversion tables are given to compare the results of 1 assay with another. Differences in the published relationships between ETS activity and respiration in phytoplankton-dominated plankton samples are largely explained by methodology.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1979	24	3					576	583		10.4319/lo.1979.24.3.0576	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1979.24.3.0576													WOS:A1979GY59000024

Review: Groundwater resource potential and status of groundwater resource development in Ethiopia	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												The groundwater resources potential of Ethiopia is estimated to be about 40 billion cubic meters. Groundwater has been used as the main source of water supply since the 1970s for the main cities, towns and dispersed rural communities across the country, where provision of reticulated surface-water schemes is often expensive because of initial project construction costs and poor water quality. The exponential growth of the urban population and agriculture-led industrial development have resulted in greater attention to groundwater as the potentially cost-effective water supply source. As part of the growing focus on the use of groundwater, the Ethiopian government is currently implementing irrigation projects. One plan involves nine irrigation projects covering an estimated area of 8,000ha, being developed on a pilot scale, with 9,000 test wells, 28,000 monitoring wells and 14,657 spring improvements. If this unprecedented Ethiopian groundwater-centred development plan is implemented successfully at such a scale, it is highly likely that its success will persuade other Sub-Saharan developing nations to put in place the necessary policies, regulations and investment for infrastructure and capacity development for exploring, exploiting and managing their groundwater resources.

Strong stratification during the summer differentiates these lakes from the oligotrophic South Adriatic ecosystem. The lakes are designated as a moderately eutrophicated ecosystem. Very small numbers of hydromedusae were noted, representing only the Anthomedusae and Leptomedusae. A new species of the genus Tima was found in considerable numbers of individuals. High abundance of the scyphomedusa Aurelia sp. was observed throughout the year. This species differs in terms of genetic divergence from Aurelia aurita found elsewhere in the Mediterranean and could be attributed to the boreal origin.

The role of anglers in preventing the spread of aquatic invasive species in the Great Lakes region	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The spread of aquatic invasive species (AIS) is an ongoing challenge in the Great Lakes region. Anglers play a pivotal role in preventing or contributing to the spread of these organisms. Anglers in the Great Lakes region were surveyed by mail during fall 2013 to assess their AIS-related awareness, knowledge, and concern as well as the actions they took to prevent the spread of AIS. Many anglers were aware of AIS, knowledgeable and concerned about them, and taking some actions to prevent their spread. However, certain actions, such as drying and disinfecting or rinsing equipment with hot water, were more difficult and were reported less frequently. Because many anglers already recognize the importance of taking action to prevent the spread of AIS, future outreach efforts may be able to deemphasize communication about the importance of taking action and focus more on strategies that will enable anglers to take these actions.

Gel-permeation chromatography of lake water labeled with 32PO43- was used to separate high- and low-molecular-weight fractions of P compounds. Fe3+ additions and irradiation with ultraviolet (UV) light increased the release of a labeled compound coeluting with orthophosphate from void volume fractions. Oxidation rates of Fe2+ in wholelake water were much slower than photoreduction rates, which suggest that, in UV light, Fe accumulated as Fe2+. Fe2+ concentrations decreased concomitant with a June increase in Chl a in the lake water. Biotic uptake of Fe2+ may deplete the ambient pool of both Fe2+ and Fe3+ in summer and make photosensitive processes less important at this time.

However, few studies have focused on the local drivers of short-term temporal variability in lacustrine biogeochemical variables. In the present study, measurements of physical, chemical, biological and optical characteristics of the shallow endorheic Lake 14 at Edmonson Point (74.33A degrees S, 165.13A degrees E) were made over the ice-free period in December 2006. A significant variation in most variables was observed. Possible drivers for these changes were the loss of the ice cover, an increase in solar irradiance, a change in photosynthetic activity and the evaporative loss of water. By removing relative changes due to evaporative losses, new insights were gained into the driving factors controlling the biogeochemistry and primary productivity in the shallow Antarctic lake. In particular, a decrease in phytoplankton biomass was observed and was probably linked to photoinhibition as revealed by an increase in photoprotective pigments. The absorbance by dissolved organic matter, when weighted with respect to evaporative loss, shows an overall reduction in humic-like absorption, most likely linked to photodegradation.					; Loiselle, Steven/ABA-3324-2020	Loiselle, Steven/0000-0001-7414-0389; 													0722-4060	1432-2056				JUL	2013	36	8					1147	1160		10.1007/s00300-013-1336-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-013-1336-2													WOS:000321975200007

Ordination methods were used in the comparisons, which covered a three-month period during the summer. Plankton and periphyton communities differed considerably, and shared only six common taxa. An ephemeral Dinobryon pulse occurred simultaneously in both communities, and represented the largest source of variability in community composition. Recovery from the pulse was faster in the phytoplankton than in the periphyton. Attachment to substrata, through its effect on cell turnover times and nutrient cycling, is hypothesized to provide a temporal refuge for plankton species during periods of unfavorable environmental conditions.

Site-specific and population factors, such as immunity or resistance to pathogens, complicate the universal application of a particular guideline to different lakes utilised for aquatic recreation. Data sets, covering 8 to 10 years of faecal coliform densities in 3 anthropogenically-impacted lakes in South Africa, are presented.

Application of the European Community (EC) and South African National Committee for Oceanographic Research (SANCOR) bathing water criteria on an annual (non-seasonal) basis resulted in non- to marginal compliance in respect of contact recreation, despite considerable natural attenuation of faecal coliform numbers. The results show that it may be practically feasible to apply the existing criteria on a seasonal basis.

These sediments provide an opportunity to examine questions concerning human-environmental interaction at the end of the Pleistocene Epoch, during the Younger Dryas climatic event. The sediment deposits show a relatively unchanging early Holocene environment of predominantly xeric conditions with subalpine and marsh communities nearby. Additionally, there is little evidence of culturally significant use of any specific plant species. The data shows that the overall climatic conditions in the region were slightly cooler and perhaps wetter, just prior to the end of the Late Glacial, than today. These results provide important perspective on early settlement patterns and human ecology in the far western region of North America.

The saline dust storm differs from common dust storm, especially considering the sources of the suspended particulate matter (PM), chemical composition, grain size, and circulation processes. Atmospheric particulate matters (TSP, PM10, PM2.5, and PM1) and their water-soluble ions were concurrently measured at two sites located at north and southeast part of Urmia lake from January 2013 to September 2013. Particulate matters (PMs) were measured using high volume sampler and HAZ-DUST EPAM-5000 particulate air monitors. In both of the sampling sites, the highest concentration of PM was observed during the summer season (521.6, 329.1, 42.6, and 36.5 for TSP, PM10, PM2.5, and PM1, respectively). A total of 11 inorganic water-soluble ions in the TSP and PM10 were identified by ion chromatography (IC). No statistically significant difference was found between PM's ions concentrations of two sampling sites. The average of the total measured water-soluble ions in the sampling sites was 28.75 +/- 12.9 mu g/m(3) (11.9 +/- 4.8% of total TSP mass) for TSP and 14.65 +/- 7.1 mu g/m(3) (8.7 +/- 4.4 of total PM10 mass) for PM10. Among all detected ions, sulfate was the dominant constituent followed by nitrate and sodium. This study showed that the water soluble salts compose 3-20% of the total mass of TSP and PM10. The PCA analysis showed that saline particulates formed from Urmia lake bed were the dominant source (57.6 %) of TSP.

J	Garvie, LAJ				Garvie, Laurence A. J.			Seasonal formation of ikaite in slime flux jelly on an infected tree (Populus fremontii) wound from the Sonoran Desert	SCIENCE OF NATURE												Ikaite is the calcium carbonate hexahydrate (CaCO3 center dot 6H(2)O), which precipitates below similar to 7 degrees C, first identified from Ikka Fjord in southwest Greenland and subsequently more widely reported. Here is described the serendipitous discovery of ikaite on a tree (Populus fremontii) wound from the hot Sonoran Desert, which precipitates during short cold periods in the winter, whereas monohydrocalcite forms through most of the year. The tree wound consists of infected wood, called wetwood that exudes a nutrient-rich water on which a jelly-like slime flux forms. Ikaite, along with alpha sulfur, precipitates in and on the bacterial slime flux jelly. Each tree wound occurs as an island of mineralization: all the elements for the mineral formation are supplied through the xylem sap expressed from the wetwood infection. The P. fremontii wetwood is capped and surrounded by a hard mineralized zone dominated by ikaite/monohydrocalcite, alpha sulfur, and a range of carbonates and sulfates, on which the slime flux jelly occurs. Water oozing from the wetwood is modestly alkaline (pH = 8.34), with elevated concentrations of K+ (5554.7 ppm) and S as SO42- (1662.9 ppm), with Ca2+ (151.9 ppm) and Mg2+ (270.3 ppm). This water chemistry favors the precipitation of ikaite/monohydrocalcite, both within and below the jelly. The ikaite is temperature sensitive, though the laboratory results show that it can persist for several days at room temperature in the sulfur-rich jelly. The ikaite, and associated mineralization within and around the slime flux jelly, illustrates a new, and likely, global form of bio-mediated mineralization.																			0028-1042	1432-1904				OCT	2022	109	5							48	10.1007/s00114-022-01818-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-022-01818-5								36056972					WOS:000849490200001

We use high-resolution records of macroscopic charcoal and plant remains from sediments of a lake in the Swiss Alps (Gouille Rion, 2343 m a.s.l.) to reconstruct local fire variability and vegetation dynamics over the last 12 000 years. 2. Species response to fire variability and to summer temperature was obtained by combining regression analyses between contiguous series of plant macrofossils, macroscopic charcoal and an available reconstruction of past summer temperature. 3. With a dynamic landscape vegetation model (LandClim), we simulated fire regimes using two levels of ignition frequency and moisture availability to disentangle the role of climate vs. humans on fire occurrence. The simulation results show that human disturbance was relevant in controlling the fire variability and are in agreement with pollen evidence of human impact from previous studies from Gouille Rion. 4. Our results show that fire is a natural disturbance agent in the tree line ecotone. Biomass availability controlled the fire regime until increased land use and anthropogenic fire during the past 4000 years changed species composition and vegetation structure close to the tree line. 5. Important species at the tree line ecotone such as Pinus cembra greatly benefitted from periods with temperature above the modern mean July temperature, if anthropogenic fire disturbance was not too severe, such as during the Bronze Age ( c. 4000 cal. years bp). 6. When mean July temperatures were lower than modern mean July values, Juniperus nana and Larix decidua were at an advantage over P. cembra. With increasing anthropogenic fire, open lands with J. nana replaced L. decidua and P. cembra forest stands. 7. Synthesis. Fire activity was low to moderate during the early and mid-Holocene. Intensified land use coupled with fire occurrence since the Bronze Age ( c. 4000 cal. years bp) had a larger impact on species composition near the tree line than climate change. Although climate change will alter vegetation composition, future dynamics of mountain forests will be co-determined by anthropogenic fire. For example, high fire variability may impede upslope establishment of forests in response to climatic warming as expected for this century, with serious implications for forest diversity.

Seventeen ostracod species were identified from the six stations sampled between 2008 and 2010. Numbers of species and individuals were both significantly reduced during 2010, which corresponded to a 3 m water level increase. Ostracod Watch Model (OWM) displayed distinct seasonal occurrences of five species (Candona neglecta, Cypria ophtalmica, Cypridopsis vidua, Limnocythere inopinata, Fabaeformiscandona cf. japonica) when Physocypria kraepelini was the only species encountered all year round. Approximately 77.2% of the relationship between species and environmental variables was expressed by the first two axes of Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). Electrical conductivity and water temperature (P=0.002) were the most influential variables on species. There was a significant negative correlation of seven species to conductivity. Of those (F. cf. japonica and C vidua) showed a significant positive correlation to water temperature, while C. candida was negatively correlated to water temperature (P<0.05). C. neglecta was the only species to show a positive correlation to dissolved oxygen. Tolerance limits for the most common species were higher than the mean water temperatures, but lower than mean levels of electrical conductivity. Finding the ratio of noncosmopolitan to cosmopolitan species "pseudorichness" as 1.13 suggested significant role of cosmopolitan species to species diversity. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

Study focus: This study focuses on addressing severe summer monsoon floods in the Poyang Lake region under subtropical monsoon climate conditions. Employing the Seasonal Water Yield analysis within the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs framework to investigate and assess the impacts of subtropical monsoon climate and urban dynamics on regional flood risk. By combining simulation results with analysis of regional urban distribution, the study aims to identify sensitive changes in flood hazard characteristics. Ultimately, the research seeks to enhance regional flood resilience to address climate change and urban development challenges. New hydrological insights for the region: Upon analyzing the model simulation results, we discovered that the subtropical humid monsoon climate contributes significantly, accounting for 35.98 % of surface runoff variability during the ephemeral lake region's flood season. Rapid urbanization amplifies the negative impact of land use change on surface runoff (with a contribution rate of 26.00 %). In urban agglomeration areas, surface runoff increased by 30 mm, and the area with surface runoff production of 60-90 mm increased by 120.33 km2. Implementing proactive ecological management measures around lakes and riverbanks has mitigated flood risks across 22 administrative regions, reducing high-risk flood areas by 92.15 km2. Restoration of lake flood storage capacity has significantly bolstered resilience against flood disasters.																				2214-5818				FEB	2025	57								102094	10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.102094	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.102094													WOS:001373098700001

This study assesses metal levels and potential human health risks associated with consuming Anabas testudineus and Channa striata. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry detected Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Zn in both fish species. Leachate metal concentrations meet international discharge standards, Cd, Cr, and Pb in the fish exceed the international accepted values. Gastrointestinal tract+liver samples show significant variation between species, particularly in Cd and Pb. EDI, THQ/HI, and TR for the both species fall below TDIs, lower than the limit of 1, and within the acceptable range of the US-EPA permissible limit, respectively. Fish consumption appears safe regarding carcinogenic risk, but exceeding metal limits could impact heavy metals accumulation in the local food chain. Raising public awareness is crucial, and governmental agencies and environmental organizations should enhance waste treatment technologies and enact relevant health legislation.					; Pheakdey, Dek Vimean/ITR-9899-2023; Vongdala, Noudeng/ITU-7339-2023; Xuan, Tran Dang/O-1352-2013	VONGDALA, Noudeng/0000-0002-9244-2003; Xuan, Tran Dang/0000-0001-7103-5698													1382-6689	1872-7077				JUN	2024	108								104460	10.1016/j.etap.2024.104460	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.etap.2024.104460		MAY 2024						38705363					WOS:001239547400001
J	Talling, JF				Talling, J. F.			Interrelated seasonal shifts in acid-base and oxidation-reduction systems that determine chemical stratification in three dissimilar English lake basins	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Chemical changers associated with seasonal stratification are described from three English lake basins of widely differing depth and algal production. They are biologically driven, linked to the acid-base system (pH, titration alkalinity, CO2 distribution) and to oxidation-reduction reactions (O-2 depletion, CO2 reduction and generation, HCO3- generation). The development of anoxia, in the shallowest and most productive basin, is associated with the generation of HCO3-, increase of electrical conductance, and some elevation of pH. This connection is lacking in the deeper basins with less complete depletion of O-2. Vertical gradients of pH, some exceeding 2.5 units, develop during summer stratification in all three basins. The largest are due to the photosynthetic depletion of CO2 in the epilimnion by dense concentrations of phytoplankton. Long-term records indicate an accentuation during lake eutrophication. There is also some increase of pH in hypolimnetic water when anoxic, with free CO2 partly converted to HCO3-. Depth-profiles of conductance reflect the production of HCO3- in deep anoxic regions. They can also indicate, as by minima, the descent of relatively cool flood-water.																			0018-8158					SEP	2006	568						275	286		10.1007/s10750-006-0116-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0116-1													WOS:000239393800022

In addition, bacterial 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) sequences were collected at one instance from the bloom layer and from waters above and below this zone. P. rubescens comprised up to 70% of particulate organic carbon during summer stratification and autumnal mixis and thus by far exceeded the total biomass both of other phytoplankton and of prokaryotes. A strong negative correlation was found between the estimated basin-wide biomass of P. rubescens and of heterotrophic bacteria, and there was different spatial niche preference of filamentous vs. picocyanobacteria. Only members of the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium lineage of Bacteroidetes showed an increasing tendency of association with the P. rubescens population, in particular at the onset of autumnal mixing. Although the filamentous cyanobacterium was the dominant primary producer throughout the year, it did not seem to be a carbon source for heterotrophic bacteria at all. We conclude that P. rubescens represents a powerful competitor of autotrophic and heterotrophic prokaryotes, likely due to both its specific physiological (photoheterotrophic) properties and its protection against zooplankton grazing. This competitiveness might be regarded as another reason for its mass occurrence in numerous lakes of the Northern hemisphere.					; Van den Wyngaert, Silke/JRY-5942-2023; Pernthaler, Jakob/A-2257-2008; Salcher, Michaela/A-1141-2013	Pernthaler, Jakob/0000-0001-7558-909X; Salcher, Michaela/0000-0003-1063-6523; Van den Wyngaert, Silke/0000-0001-9163-4858; Posch, Thomas/0000-0001-5145-3761													0024-3590					JAN	2011	56	1					97	109		10.4319/lo.2011.56.1.0097	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2011.56.1.0097													WOS:000290677200008

We examined 240 ponds across eight countries (seven in Europe and Uruguay) to assess how internal pond characteristics, surrounding land cover and livestock intensity, seasonal climatic variation, and climate influence nutrient concentrations across spatial and temporal scales. Nutrient concentrations were strongly associated with internal features: shallow ponds and short hydroperiods had higher total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, while thermal stratification, typically found in deeper ponds, was associated with higher TN, indicating enhanced internal nutrient recycling. Land use also played a significant role with agricultural intensity increasing nutrient concentration (both TN and TP), whereas forest cover reduced TP. Seasonal variation modulated these patterns, with higher TP concentrations observed in summer, and with dilution effects during wetter and cooler periods, particularly for TN in semi-permanent ponds. These findings underscore the combined influence of physical characteristics, landscape context, and climate variability on nutrient concentrations in ponds and highlight the need for integrated, multi-scale approaches to anticipate the impacts of global climate change effects on these ecologically valuable ecosystems.

Four functional phytoplankton groups were defined in order to represent the functional diversity of algae in the lake, and simulated simultaneously. In a 3-year application we show that model outputs are in good agreement with observations, particularly in terms of the onset of algal growth in spring, which was strongly associated with the onset of stratification, and the spatiotemporal distribution of the algae. In a long-term simulation over 21 years (1979 to 2000) the model also predicts shifts in the algal community composition attributable to the ongoing reoligotrophication of Lake Constance. This model is going to be applied for short- and long-term-prognoses for water management in Lake Constance (BodenseeOnline project).

The Chironomidae of Grothusvatn, Sandoy, Faroe Islands: climatic and lake-phosphorus reconstructions, and the impact of human settlement	HOLOCENE												Chironomids were examined as part of a multiproxy palaeolimnological study of Grothusvatn, Sandoy, Faroe Islands. A total of 37 taxa was found in the top 1 m of the core. Chironomid-inferred total phosphorus and temperature reconstructions indicate that after landnam (the Norse settlement period) total phosphorus levels rose slightly, then peaked at a temperature minimum (interpreted as the 'Little Ice Age'). Total phosphorus levels subsequently fell to only slightly above pre-settlement levels at the sediment surface. Little indication of increased erosion in the catchment after landnam was found, and it is likely that the impacts of human settlement on Grothusvatn and its catchment were slight. We therefore propose that the temperature decrease caused the increase in the lake's productivity.					; Church, Mike/F-6733-2010	Lawson, Ian Thomas/0000-0002-3547-2425; Church, Mike/0000-0001-7908-7812; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				DEC	2007	17	8					1259	1264		10.1177/0959683607085133	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683607085133													WOS:000252593700018

Ecosystem metabolism and nutrient dynamics in the main channel and backwaters of the Upper Mississippi River	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Photosynthesis and respiration are primary drivers of dissolved oxygen dynamics in rivers. We measured dissolved oxygen dynamics, aquatic ecosystem metabolism, algal abundance and nutrient concentrations at main channel and backwater sites on a reach of the Upper Mississippi River that borders the states of Wisconsin and Minnesota (U.S.A.). We asked (i) how ecosystem metabolism rates, dissolved oxygen dynamics and nutrient concentrations differed in the main channel and in backwaters, (ii) whether ecosystem metabolism relates to solar irradiance, nutrient concentration, algal abundance, temperature and river discharge and (iii) whether the relationships between ecosystem metabolism and these environmental factors differs between the main channel and backwaters. The rates of aquatic ecosystem metabolism in the main channel were among the highest reported for large rivers. Mean daily gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R) and net ecosystem production (NEP) in the main channel in the 2006 growing season were 10, 6 and 4g O(2)m(2) d(-1), respectively. Solar irradiance, discharge and temperature, rather than nutrients, accounted for most temporal variability in gross primary production (GPP). Discharge was negatively associated with GPP in the main channel and temperature positively associated with GPP in backwaters. Primary production consistently exceeded respiration in the main channel in summer, resulting in persistent oxygen supersaturation from late June to early August. Maximum chlorophyll concentrations (140g L-1) were observed in the main channel, rather than the backwaters. Nitrogen and phosphorus exhibited contrasting temporal patterns in backwaters probably reflecting differences in their sources and sinks; N declined during the growing season while P increased.

J	Ahrnsbrak, WF; Wing, MR				Ahrnsbrak, WF; Wing, MR			Wind-induced hypolimnion exchange in Lake Ontario's Kingston basin: Potential effects on oxygen	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The hypolimnion of Lake Ontario's Kingston basin exhibited significant oxygen depletion during 1991. The degree of hypolimnion oxygen depletion was consistent with what would be expected on the basis of morphology. No such depletion was observed in 1992, a year during which hypolimnetic currents in the channel west of Galloo Island flowed predominantly from Lake Ontario into the Kingston basin. The prevailing southwest winds during the summer of 1991 were anomalously persistent. Wind and current data front 1992 suggest that winds from the south-southeast, departures from the prevailing southwest winds, enable hypolimnetic flow from the main basin of Lake Ontario to replace the hypolimnion. This apparently failed to occur during 1991.																			0380-1330						1998	24	1					145	151		10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70806-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70806-8													WOS:000072958100013
J	Hondzo, M; Stefan, HG				Hondzo, M; Stefan, HG			Long-term lake water quality predictors	WATER RESEARCH												Daily water temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles in 3002 Minnesota lakes have been simulated by deterministic process-based water quality models with daily meteorological conditions from 1955 to 1979 as input. From the simulated results, indicators of lake water quality and fish habitat characteristics have been extracted and correlated selectively with normal air temperature, lake mean depth, wind-related densimetric Froude number and Lake number. A seasonal maximum Lake number was found to be a good predictor for volume averaged water temperatures, maximum water temperatures near lake bottom, seasonal stratification characteristics, volume averaged dissolved oxygen concentrations, anoxia characteristics and fish good-growth habitat. Lakes with a maximum daily Lake number bigger than 1.0, are seasonally stratified, have low hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentration, and only a fraction of lake depth available for good-growth of fish. Lakes with maximum daily Lake number less than 1.0 are polymictic, with high dissolved oxygen concentration, and with maximum depth available for good fish growth. Empirical formulas for lake water quality and stratification indicators derived from the simulation results give good predictions of temperature and dissolved oxygen characteristics estimated from measurements in seven Minnesota lakes.

Climate extremes are associated with invertebrate taxonomic and functional composition in mountain lakes	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Climate change is expected to increase climate variability and the occurrence of extreme climatic events, with potentially devastating effects on aquatic ecosystems. However, little is known about the role of climate extremes in structuring aquatic communities or the interplay between climate and local abiotic and biotic factors. Here, we examine the relative influence of climate and local abiotic and biotic conditions on biodiversity and community structure in lake invertebrates. We sampled aquatic invertebrates and measured environmental variables in 19 lakes throughout California, USA, to test hypotheses of the relationship between climate, local biotic and environmental conditions, and the taxonomic and functional structure of aquatic invertebrate communities. We found that, while local biotic and abiotic factors such as habitat availability and conductivity were the most consistent predictors of alpha diversity, extreme climate conditions such as maximum summer temperature and dry-season precipitation were most often associated with multivariate taxonomic and functional composition. Specifically, sites with high maximum temperatures and low dry-season precipitation housed communities containing high abundances of large predatory taxa. Furthermore, both climate dissimilarity and abiotic dissimilarity determined taxonomic turnover among sites (beta diversity). These findings suggest that while local-scale environmental variables may predict alpha diversity, climatic variability is important to consider when projecting broad-scale aquatic community responses to the extreme temperature and precipitation events that are expected for much of the world during the next century.

The time series analysis revealed that the total biomass as well as the biomass of the two dominant taxa the raphidophyte Gonyostomum semen and Peridinium dinoflagellates decreased (changes as indicated by trends -0.014 g m(-3) yr(-1) and -0.006 g m(-3) yr(-1), respectively), whereas the biomass of the subdominant Cryptomonas spp. did not change. The timing of ice-out, the extent of the spring circulation or the length of the stratification period could not be firmly connected to the phytoplankton phenology. Concentrations of major nutrients decreased during the period, whereas the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and water colour increased. These changes probably led to the decrease in the biomass of the dominant G. semen and Peridinium spp., and thus in the total phytoplankton biomass.

J	Welcomme, RL				Welcomme, Robin L.			An overview of global catch statistics for inland fish	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE					ICES Symposium on Fishery-Dependent Information	AUG 23-26, 2010	Galway, IRELAND					The reported global inland fish catch passed 10 million tonnes in 2008, after almost linear growth from the early 1950s. The rise coincides with an increasing number of reports of falling catches resulting from environmental degradation. It is thought that catches from inland waters were underreported in the past because of constraints on collecting the relevant data. National approaches to data collection are not generally comparable and their accuracy not usually assessed. National data processing and reporting should be audited, and training undertaken to harmonize these activities. The apparently bigger catches probably result from better reporting of actual catches rather than any increase in the amount of fish landed. Current data are sufficient only for a general overview of global inland catches of fish, rather than for the detailed analysis needed for management, policy formulation, and the valuation of inland fisheries. There is a need for improved approaches to data collection and for historical catches to be corrected to account for changes in methodologies and reporting procedures.																			1054-3139	1095-9289				SEP	2011	68	8					1751	1756		10.1093/icesjms/fsr035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsr035													WOS:000294075400022

Here we show that the phytoplankton produces large amounts of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), which is best-known as a marine compound. Lake-water DMSP concentrations in the spring season are comparable with those in the oceans, and colony water in ice exhibits extremely high concentrations. DMSP concentration of surface water correlates with plankton density and reaches a maximum in mid-April, with temperature-dependent fluctuations. DMSP is released from plankton cells into water in warm days. DMSP is a characteristic osmolyte of marine algae; our results demonstrate that freshwater plankton, Gymnodinium baicalense, has DMSP-producing ability, and efficiently uses the limited sulfur resource (only 1/500 of sea sulfate) to survive in freshwater ice. Plankton in Lake Baikal do not need an osmolyte, and our results clearly indicate that DMSP plays a cryoprotective role. DMSP, although a characteristic marine compound, could also be an important zwitterion for algae of other boreal lakes, alpine snow, and glaciers. DMSP potentially serves as a form of cryoprotection for freshwater dinoflagellates during the time of ice melting in Lake Baikal although sulfur content of the lake water is much lower than seawater and algae do not need an osmolyte in freshwater ice.					; Ohira, Shin-Ichi/AAN-5628-2020	Saeki, Kentaro/0000-0003-2401-3570; Toda, Kei/0000-0001-6577-1752; Ohira, Shin-Ichi/0000-0002-5958-339X; 														2399-3642				NOV 24	2023	6	1							1194	10.1038/s42003-023-05573-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05573-9								38001159					WOS:001109195000006

The Intraseasonal Variability of African Easterly Wave Energetics	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												African easterly waves (AEWs) and associated perturbation kinetic energy (PKE) exhibit significant intraseasonal variability in tropical North Africa during boreal summer. Consistent with East Africa (e.g., east of Lake Chad) being an initiation region for AEWs, previous studies have shown that increased East African PKE precedes and leads to increased West African AEW activity on intraseasonal time scales. In this study, reanalysis budgets of PKE and perturbation available potential energy (PAPE) are used to understand this behavior. The variability of PIKE and PAPE sources is analyzed as a function of Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) phase and a local 30-90-day West African PKE index to diagnose when and where eddy energy conversions terms are important to periods of increased or decreased intraseasonal AEW activity. In East Africa, an increased meridional temperature gradient locally enhances baroclinic energy conversion anomalies to initiate periods of increased intraseasonal AEW activity. Downstream barotropic and baroclinic energy conversions associated with strong AEWs are important for the maintenance of intraseasonal AEW activity in West Africa. Barotropic energy conversions dominate south of the African easterly jet (AEJ), while baroclinic energy conversions are most important north of the AEJ. In both East and West Africa, diabatic heating does not appear to aid intraseasonal PIKE creation. Instead, negative PAPE tendency anomalies due to the diabatic heating temperature covariance act as a negative feedback to increased baroclinic energy conversion downstream in the AEJ.

These surveys revealed a decrease in cash flow per fishing enterprise of 66%, so that by 1980 the average enterprise could not meet its capital costs. The reduction in cash flow was mainly attributable to decreased gross revenues, due to decreased catch per unit effort on traditional fishing grounds, an increase in the proportion of lower grade whitefish in the catch, and a decrease in the average number of days spent fishing per enterprise. Consideration of a freight subsidy paid to fishermen further accented the decrease in financial performance. By 1981 economic viability probably had worsened further.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1984	41	4					715	719		10.1139/f84-083	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f84-083													WOS:A1984SU52800016

Hydrological sentinels and the relative emergence of climate change signals in New Zealand river flows	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL												Hydrological impacts of climate change are prompting water resource and flood hazard management to adapt to non-stationary conditions. Among the factors influencing these policy decisions is the question of timing: when are we likely to see climate change effects? Using a national climate-hydrology model cascade over the 21(st) century, times and extents of emergence of six hydrological metrics are evaluated across New Zealand rivers. While the stringency of the emergence criteria has a significant effect on timing and extent, emergence for all metrics generally occurs after mid-century, if at all, and in the country's South Island. Looking at the first emerging metrics, in contrast, allows us to sidestep the high uncertainties of the time of emergence, revealing mean winter flows to be the most extensive sentinel of climate change in New Zealand rivers among the metrics considered. This has implications for hydrological monitoring to inform timely climate change adaptation.					; Collins, Daniel/AAY-7327-2021	Collins, Daniel/0000-0002-1984-4209; 													0262-6667	2150-3435				NOV 18	2021	66	15					2146	2154		10.1080/02626667.2021.1987439	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2021.1987439		NOV 2021											WOS:000717883300001

It consists of a wedged capacitance tip mounted at the end of a penetration pole. By appropriate placement of its reference, guard and sensor conductive surfaces, the capacitor sheds horizontal electric field lines resolving horizontal snow layers of 2.5-mm thickness. A prototype of the probe was tested at the mountain resort of Alta near Salt Lake City, Utah. There, it recorded the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant through a typical winter snow pack. Using independent calibrations, measurements of the dielectric modulus provided an accurate profile of density later confirmed by the excavation of a detailed snow cover profile.

New features of the model include a correction for snowfall undermeasurement, mid-winter snowmelt, snow density estimates and estimation of the effect of exposed vegetation on aerodynamic roughness height during blowing snow. Importantly, the model now includes algorithms to estimate the threshold wind speed for snow transport and to estimate the probability of blowing snow occurrence. The probability of blowing snow occurrence is used to scale the blowing snow fluxes horizontally so that estimates from a 1 x 1 km surface area control volume may be extrapolated to larger scales, varying fetches and vegetation types. As a demonstration, the model is operated using standard meteorological data from meteorological stations in the Canadian Prairies and compared to snow accumulation measurements at these stations. The model is also used to estimate snow accumulation for comparison to extensive field snow surveys from the Bad Lake experimental basin in west-central Saskatchewan. It is shown that the new version of PBSM can provide estimates of snow accumulation, melt, transport and sublimation from hourly to seasonal time periods for varying land surfaces.

Recent studies have explored the degree of NOM removal in groundwater. In this study, we further elaborate the NOM removal at a lakeside natural bank infiltration site that functions as a surrogate for MAR. Our objective was to quantify the carbon budget in the aquifer based on concentration measurements of dissolved (in)organic carbon, and the molecular changes in NOM using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). According to the carbon budget, only 25% of the dissolved carbon entering the aquifer was organic, and it predominantly originated from lake water. Of the inorganic majority, on average 40% was produced in the vadose zone above the groundwater table, 31% in the lake bank, 22% in the aquifer as a result of degrading organic matter of lake water, and 7% in the lake. Seasonal concentration variations suggested that the lake bank was the main carbon source in the summer, increasing the carbon concentration of infiltrating lake water, that is, 3.0 mg/L to 7.9 mg/L. FT-ICR MS results showed 4960 to 5330 individual compounds in lake and groundwater. NOM removal in the aquifer was selective: the relative abundance of oxygen-containing species decreased from 75 to 31%, while the relative abundance of sulfur-containing species increased from 15 to 57%. The average molecular weights of both species remained unchanged. The study highlighted the role of lake bank processes and sulfur-containing species in groundwater quality.

Habitat Selection and Movement Patterns of Spotted Turtles (Clemmys guttata): Effects of Spatial and Temporal Scales of Analyses	COPEIA												Habitat selection Is Important for a species' survival, and Its identification represents a crucial component in the development of conservation strategies. Habitat selection occurs when habitats are used disproportionately to their availability, and what constitutes available habitat will depend on the biology of the species under Investigation. Habitat selection and movement patterns of Spotted Turtles (Clemmys guttata) in a population near Lake Huron, Ontario, were studied over two consecutive years using radio telemetry. Selection was assessed at two spatial scales (second order, home range from population range; and third order, locations from home range) using compositional analyses. Spotted Turtles shift macrohabitat use throughout the annual cycle, therefore seasonal habitat selection was also analyzed. Selection occurred at both scales tested, and the ranking of preferred habitats differed based on the scale of analysis. Selection differed across seasons (emergence, nesting, post-nesting), but was similar between the sexes. Despite seasonal shifts In macrohabitat selection, microhabitat used did not differ seasonally, but females were more likely to choose locations with cover in the late summer compared to males. Individuals selected overwintering sites that afforded structural protection and a temperature near 0 degrees C. Movements were similar between the sexes, with a reduction In activity In July and August. The seasonal variability In habitat selection supports the need for surveys at multiple time-points within the year to fully document the critical habitat requirements of Spotted Turtles.																			0045-8511	1938-5110				FEB 26	2010		1					86	96		10.1643/CE-09-141	http://dx.doi.org/10.1643/CE-09-141													WOS:000275185500012

The data show that, following the "Climatic Optimum" of the early Holocene, neoglaciation was asynchronous: glaciers formed at different times at different sites, depending on critical altitudinal thresholds in relation to the scale of climatic variations. Neoglaciation began as early as ca. 6400 yr B.P. at Gjuvvatnet, ca. 3400 yr B.P. at Midtivatnet, and later than ca. 1000 yr B.P. at Storevatnet. These differences in glacierization provide a key to reconstructing the fluctuating decline in mean summer temperature (relative to the present) from at least +1-degrees-C during the mid-Holocene to below -2-degrees-C in the "Little Ice Age."																			0091-7613					NOV	1992	20	11					991	994		10.1130/0091-7613(1992)020<0991:ANAHCC>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0091-7613(1992)020<0991:ANAHCC>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1992JW83400008

For each experiment fish were offered different densities of the same mixture of zooplankton from Oneida Lake, NY. As density of prey increased, several measures of selectivity for Daphnia either remained unchanged or declined, while all measures of selectivity for calanoids and cyclopoids increased. At all densities small to mid-sized Daphnia were preferred to large Daphnia. Reanalyses of other studies suggests this may be the general pattern for young planktivores, despite the contrary predictions of several models of prey selection. For young planktivores, differences in the nutritional quality of zooplankton prey, including resultant growth efficiency and speed of digestion, can account for these results.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAY	1990	47	5					882	887		10.1139/f90-101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f90-101													WOS:A1990DD54900004

Daily trajectories were computed forward for eight days from an origin centered over Lake Eyre at 500 m above the ground surface. Trajectory density maps were then created within a GIS for five levels; 0-500 m agl., 500-1000 m agl., 1000-1500 m agl., 1500-2000 m agl. and 2000-5000 m agl. These show that air parcel trajectories originating from Lake Eyre can affect regions many thousands of kilometers from the Australian continent in a relatively short period of time. Importantly, under favourable atmospheric conditions these air parcels have the potential to transport dust and other aerosols. During the austral winter, trajectories extended north to the southern Philippines highlighting the potential for dust from central Australia to affect most of Indonesia. This includes the tropical rainforests of Borneo and New Guinea, and the coral reefs of northern Australia and the Indonesian archipelago. We also show the potential for transport of dust from Lake Eyre to the Antarctic and much of the South Pacific and Southern Oceans. Accordingly, dust from Lake Eyre may affect biogeochemical cycles, sediment budgets, atmospheric processes and a wide range of ecosystems over a region much larger than previously thought. This highlights the need for further research to confirm the deposition of dust in the areas mapped by the present study. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This is due to hydrogen isotopic fractionation between vapor and water in silicate melts that is significantly greater than unity for rhyolitic melts, whereas it is less than unity for basaltic melts probably resulting from hydrogen escape. The 1986 Lake Nyos gas disaster was caused by sudden release of magmatic carbon dioxide that had been gradually trapped by the crater lake. Since carbon dioxide is continuously supplied to the lake bottom in the form of CO2-rich warm spring, recurrence of gas burst is quite likely unless CO2 is removed from the lake.

We provide estimates of Weichselian Late Glacial and Early Holocene (ca. 15-8 ka BP) mean July air temperatures on the basis of changes in the fossil assemblage using a joint Norwegian-Swiss transfer function. In our study, the climate was found to be relatively cold during the Late Pleniglacial, with July temperatures ranging between 11.2 and 12.3 degrees C. With the exception of the youngest section of this interval, temperatures during the Bolling-Allerod interstadial were relatively stable and warm, with values around 13.3-14.5 degrees C. During the Younger Dryas (YD), July temperatures varied between 12.7 and 16 degrees C, and these particular results are in agreement with other climatic reconstructions from the central to the eastern part of the European continent showing no or moderate summer temperature decrease during the YD, or even a slightly warming trend. A relatively warm and climatically stable early YD phase was followed by a variable and overall cooler younger phase. At the beginning of the Early Holocene, our reconstructed July temperatures increased to 17.7 degrees C. We demonstrate that general patterns of temperature changes inferred from chironomids during the Last Glacial Termination are similar to various multi-proxy reconstructions in Europe but we observe two unusually strong and abrupt cooling events: one that may be linked with the Gerzensee oscillation at the end of the Bolling-Allerod Interstadial and another that probably corresponds to the Preboreal Oscillation, although the temperature decreases in these intervals were much more pronounced than observed in other chironomid records from Europe, suggesting that local climatic factors and ecosystem responses may have overamplified these cold events in the temperature reconstruction. However, other proxies (geochemistry, pollen) support the interpretation of climatically driven palaeoenvironmental changes such as the development of vegetation cover, changes in lake productivity, pedogenesis and erosion.					; Trubac, Jakub/J-5890-2012; Hošek, Jan/AAA-1271-2020; Kubovčík, Vladimír/CAF-1856-2022; Heiri, Oliver/JCE-4598-2023	Hosek, Jan/0000-0002-3463-0874; Trubac, Jakub/0000-0002-9470-1304; Heiri, Oliver/0000-0002-3957-5835; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				APR 1	2021	567								110239	10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.110239	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.110239		FEB 2021											WOS:000636761000010
J	LAKATOS, G				LAKATOS, G			COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF BIOTECTON (PERIPHYTON) SAMPLES COLLECTED FROM NATURAL SUBSTRATE IN WATERS OF DIFFERENT TROPHIC STATE	ACTA BOTANICA ACADEMIAE SCIENTIARUM HUNGARICAE												Comparative taxonomic and biomass analyses of biotecton samples taken from natural substrate (Typha latifolia L.) of waters of different trophic states in Hungary were conducted in the autumn of 1974. The composition of the biotecton taken from the natural substrate is in correlation with the trophic state of the given water body. The greatest species diversity can be found in the impendment of Olahret, which has a meso-eutrophic state. The qualitative and quantitative composition of the phyto- and zootecton from the eutrophic fishpond of Polgar is very similar to that in meso-eutrophic conditions. In the oligotrophic lake of Nyekladhaza, the small number of algae species and individuals, and the larger biomass are characteristic of the biotecton, in comparison with the higher degree of trophic state in the other 3 water bodies. In waters with nutrient enrichment and planktonic eutrophication, the phytotecton, like the macrophytes, is strongly reduced. This indicates an autosaprobitic state. The decrease in species diversity and cluster analysis indicate that the composition of the biotecton from the Hortobagy fishpond''s polytrophic water differs from that found in mesotrophic-eutrophic ponds.																			0001-5350						1978	24	3-4					285	300																WOS:A1978HA15900004

During winter 1995 and 1997 field trips to Rabbit Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada, a large amount of video data containing auroral curls was acquired. Analysis of this data set has led to much improved insight into the properties of these features. Observed spatial and temporal characteristics are presented, with results compared to those of earlier surveys wherever applicable. Striking parallels between the characteristics of these similar to 1 km scale size curls and the characteristics of the similar to 100 km scale size auroral "spirals" observed by the Freja UV imager are pointed out and discussed in terms of shear-driven instabilities. In addition, observations of the interesting new phenomena of "auroral kinks" and "spinning auroral patches" are briefly described.

Toolbox for the sampling and monitoring of benthic cyanobacteria	WATER RESEARCH												Benthic cyanobacteria are a nuisance because they produce highly potent toxins and taste and odour compounds. Despite this, benthic cyanobacteria remain far less studied than their planktonic counter-parts. For example, little is known about their growth or the seasonality of their secondary metabolite production. Moreover, sampling and monitoring techniques commonly used for the survey of planktonic species are not necessarily applicable to benthic forms. This study aimed to develop and validate a new sampling device for the routine monitoring of benthic mats. Molecular monitoring techniques were established and validated on environmental samples collected in a South Australian reservoir (SA-L2). A total of eight qPCR assays were applied to samples in order to track seasonal variations in cyanobacteria concentrations and associated secondary metabolite production. Next Generation Sequencing was utilised to conduct a microbial community composition analysis and to select the most appropriate substrate material for the sampling of benthic cyanobacteria. The concentration of the secondary metabolites geosmin and 2-methyl-isoborneol were quantified using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography, and concentrations of key nutrients (N, P) were quantified in water samples. The sampling device designed proved efficient and easy to use in the field. The qPCR assay designed for the amplification of the cyanobacterial MIB synthase had a high efficiency with a minimum limit of quantification of 4 cell-equivalents per reaction and identified a potential source of MIB in SA-L2 Reservoir. The peak season for benthic growth and secondary metabolite production was observed in spring. Proportionally, 35% of the variability in water geosmin concentrations can be explained by benthic actinobacterial and cyanobacterial activity, showing that freshwater benthic mats represent a significant source of taste and odour compounds.

J	Rautio, M				Rautio, M			Community structure of crustacean zooplankton in subarctic ponds - effects of altitude and physical heterogeneity	ECOGRAPHY												Crustacean zooplankton (Cladocera, Copepoda) distribution patterns, community composition and response to altitude, temperature, pH and surface area were studied in 17 fishless subarctic ponds in the Kilpisjarvi area, NW Finnish Lapland. Despite their harshness, the ponds harboured diverse groups of zooplankton. Altogether 50 species were found from ice-out in June-August 1994. There was both a marked decline in the species number and a change in the composition of pond communities with increasing altitude and decreasing temperature as well as decreasing pH. Pond surface area was least significant in determining the species composition. Ponds at low elevations harboured up to 21 species while the fell top ponds usually had <10 species. Chydoridaen cladocerans were the most dominant group even though their number greatly diminished in ponds above the timber line.																			0906-7590					JUN	1998	21	3					327	335		10.1111/j.1600-0587.1998.tb00570.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.1998.tb00570.x													WOS:000074415900011

Submerged macrophytes can influence the epiphytic algal community by directly or indirectly modifying environmental conditions (nutrients, light, etc.). From December to June of the following year, we investigated the dynamics of the dominant winter species Potamogeton crispus, its epiphytic algae, and water quality parameters in the shallow Liangzi Lake in China. The richness of epiphytic algae had a trend similar to that of P. crispus coverage, which increased in the first four months and then decreased in the following three months. The structural equation model (SEM) showed that P. crispus affected the richness of epiphytic algae by reducing nutrient concentrations (reduction in total organic carbon, total nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand) and enhancing water transparency (reduction in turbidity and total suspend solids) to enhance the richness of epiphytic algae. The results indicated that high amounts of submerged macrophyte cover can increase the richness of the epiphytic algal community by changing water quality.

Therefore, multi-date MODIS images were analyzed by GIS to calculate and identify the spatial distribution of WTI, TSM indicator. Then, the relationship between wind conditions and TSM's resuspension in Ichkeul Lake was clarified. After that, the cluster analysis and the temporal fluctuation of daily wind speed; rainfall, and the Potamogeton pectinatus phenology were used to interpret the seasonal distribution of the turbid water. Consequently, the linear correlation between WTI and observed data was found (R-2=0.66; r=0.809) and proved by ANOVA test, where P=0.00143 (<=0.05). Besides, the prevailing effects of winds on turbidity were detected, where the daily mean value of WTI was positively correlated with daily wind speed with r=0.63 and r=0.65, respectively, for P1 and P2. Thus, the turbidity increases with the increase of wind velocity. Subsequently, wind speed threshold was chosen to be 2.8m/s. Moreover, the frequent wind with velocity varied between 5 and 7m/s and may exceed the 9m/s blew from the WNW direction. Added to this, the seasonal distribution of WTI revealed that the most and moderate turbid days were detected frequently in summer season. Following the prevailing wind direction, the TSM was distributed from the center of the SSE part of Ichkeul Lake.					; IRIE, Mitsuteru/T-2486-2019	IRIE, Mitsuteru/0000-0002-5291-5435; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				MAR	2019	78	6							228	10.1007/s12665-019-8126-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-019-8126-2													WOS:000461372900002

However, seasonality in the past and under changing climates is little studied. Submonthly records of sclerochronological delta O-18 and delta C-13 values of Melanopsis shells from the Jordan River Dureijat archaeological site (JRD) in the upper Jordan River valley presented here document the hydrology of paleo-Lake Hula. These records were assessed for changes in seasonal hydrology in the lake and compared with modern shells collected from present-day waterbodies in northern Israel and with models of delta O-18(shell). Results from shells in sediments dating from the last glacial maximum (LGM) to the Bolling-Allerod imply changes in waterbody size that qualitatively parallel changes in the late Pleistocene Lake Lisan levels; Hula Lake was well buffered when Lake Lisan stood at a high stand and poorly buffered when water levels were lower. Furthermore, data from shells dated to the LGM suggest inflowing water with lower delta O-18 values than local rainfall, providing evidence for a greater proportion of snow in the catchment than today. Reconstruction of water delta O-18 and mixing-model calculations suggest that snowmelt contribution to spring water during the LGM may have been more than twice the amount in the modern-day catchment.

In the present study, we investigated the composition and seasonal variation in the diet of the introduced Japanese smelt Hypomesus nipponensis, a small planktivorous fish, in Lake Ulungur, China. The objective was to examine the ecological role of this established non-indigenous smelt through the analysis of its diet, which might give more insight into the relationship between its introduction and the collapse of the native Eurasian perch population. Results showed that the Japanese smelt had a broader feeding spectrum than had been previously reported. Of 10 taxonomic or ecological categories of food, cladocerans (54.70%) and rotifers (15.39%) were the most important food items in terms of the index of relative importance (IRI), whereas surface food and chironomid larvae were the most important by weight. Although cladocerans were consistently the most important food, rotifers and copepods, together with surface food and chironomid larvae, substituted when cladocerans were scarcer. Because both rotifers and chironomid larvae are important food of larval and young perch, introduction of Japanese smelt into the lake might be responsible for the collapse of the perch population because of the suppression of rotifers and chironomid larvae in spring through seasonal predation.					wang, yubo/M-2342-2018; zhang, hongcheng/O-9719-2015														1323-1650	1448-6059					2013	64	6					549	557		10.1071/MF12168	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF12168													WOS:000319746000006

The results of the linear trend analysis indicate that two regions of the USA evidence significant changes in monthly snowfall over the period. These areas include the Great Lakes/upper mid-west and high plains regions of the USA. In the Great Lakes/upper mid-west sector, positive linear trends are found in monthly snowfall totals for the mid-winter months (December, January, February). For the high plains region, positive linear trends are found for the month of December. Principal components analysis (PCA) is used with seasonal snowfall data in order to better understand the spatial and temporal nature of seasonal snowfall variations across the USA. The PCA isolates six spatially coherent regions in which seasonal snowfall varied similarly over the 40-year period. Only one of these regions, centred on the Great Lakes and upper mid-west, displays any long-term change in seasonal snowfall, a positive trend during the period 1945-1946 through to 1984-1985. These results are discussed in the context of man-induced and natural environmental changes.					; Mote, Thomas/U-6681-2017; Leathers, Daniel/A-3665-2010	Leathers, Daniel/0000-0001-9002-9031; Mote, Thomas/0000-0002-0021-0134; 													0899-8418					JAN-FEB	1993	13	1					65	76		10.1002/joc.3370130105	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.3370130105													WOS:A1993KJ10400004

Integrating machine learning and remote sensing for long-term monitoring of chlorophyll-a in Chilika Lagoon, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Chlorophyll-a (Chla) is recognized as a key indicator of water quality and ecological health in aquatic ecosystems, offering valuable insights into ecosystem dynamics and changes over time. This study aimed to to develop and validate a robust ML model for estimating Chla using Landsat data, produce a time series of Chl a maps, and analyze the spatiotemporal variability of Chla in Chilika Lagoon, Asia's largest brackish water lagoon. Nine ML regression models, including Extreme Gradient Boost, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, and Bagging Regression, were evaluated using Landsat imagery and field data. After extensive hyperparameter tuning, the Bagging Regression model achieved the highest estimation accuracy, with an R2 of 0.8776 and a Root Mean Square Error of 0.9190 mu g/L. This optimized model was subsequently applied to generate a time series of Chla maps for Chilika Lagoon from 2014 to 2023, revealing notable seasonal and spatial variability. Chla concentrations peaked during summer months and were generally higher in the lagoon's northwestern region, gradually decreasing towards the southern area. This approach holds promise for precise Chla monitoring in diverse lagoon environments and may aid in the assessment and management of similar coastal and inland lake ecosystems worldwide.

Fractionation of rare earth elements (REEs) and actinides (U and Th) originating from acid thermal water during artificial and natural neutralization processes of surface waters	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												In the Tamagawa geothermal area of Akita Prefecture, northern Japan, Obuki spring discharges a large amount of thermal water (similar to 9000 L/min), which is chloride-rich and acidic (pH 1.2). We have investigated changes in the physico-chemical nature and fractionation mechanisms of rare earth elements (REEs) including Y and actinides (Th and U) in the Shibukuro and Tama rivers into which acid thermal water from the Obuki spring discharges. The geochemical behavior of these elements is shown to be mainly controlled by pH-dependent sorption onto ferric and/or aluminum oxy-hydroxides (HFO and HAO). HFO is formed around pH > 3. In the upstream region, where pH is less than 4, dissolved Th is removed due to precipitation of Th(SO4)(2(s)). Whereas, under pH condition greater than 4, remaining dissolved Th is nearly completely sorbed onto suspended HFO, where hydroxyl species of Th are thermodynamically significant. Then, the Th(SO4)(2(s)) and HFO-sorbed Th are nearly completely removed in an upstream man-made lake. Dissolved U is also removed mainly by sorption onto HFO, where hydroxyl species of UO2 are predominant. A considerable portion of U is also trapped in the sediments of this lake. On the other hand, removal of REEs is nearly negligible until the lake. This is the first fractionation among REEs and actinides caused by pH-dependent sorption, and the order of removal from river water is Th > U >> REEs. The remaining dissolved U and REEs in the river waters are transported farther downstream. At pH values of >6, suspended HAO is effectively formed, and the second fractionation among REEs and U occurs. During the second fractionation, REEs are removed by HAO, whereas U largely remains as a dissolved species in river water under higher pH conditions. Lighter REEs, such as La and Ce, tend to remain in the river waters compared to the other REEs including Y. The predominant chemical species for UO 2 during the second fractionation are carbonate complex species, and relative proportions of hydroxyl species drastically decreases, resulting in prevention of U sorption onto HAO.

Use of arsenic contaminated sludge in making ornamental bricks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Arsenic contaminated sludge can be substantially found from the treatment of arsenic contaminated ground water. Lake of proper management and reuse of this sludge can create further environmental problem as there is probability of mixing with soil and water. In this paper, effort is taken in order to use of such waste. Here, effectivencss of using this sludge during the process of making ornamental brick has been analyzed and justified. The detailed study was made upon the suitability of sludge in making bricks. Results of different tests indicate that sludge proportion is the key factor for determining the quality of ornamental bricks/tiles. The compressive strength of ornamental bricks mutually decreases with increase of sludge proportion. This Study showed that arsenic contaminated sludge could be used safely up to 4 % for making ornamental bricks. Because upper than this limit, the quality of bricks or tiles may be fallen considerably.					Alam, Nazmul/C-8201-2016; Alam, Md. Nazmul/C-8201-2016; Islam, Md/ABB-2487-2021	Alam, Md.

However, current estimates are still uncertain and do not account for diel variability of CH4 emissions. In this study, we performed high-resolution measurements of CH4 flux from several lakes, using an automated and sensor-based flux measurement approach (in total 4,580 measurements), and demonstrated a clear and consistent diel lake CH4 flux pattern during stratification and mixing periods. The maximum of CH4 flux were always noted between 10:00 and 16:00, whereas lower CH4 fluxes typically occurred during the nighttime (00:00-04:00). Regardless of the lake, CH4 emissions were on an average 2.4 higher during the day compared to the nighttime. Fluxes were higher during daytime on nearly 80% of the days. Accordingly, estimates and extrapolations based on daytime measurements only most likely result in overestimated fluxes, and consideration of diel variability is critical to properly assess the total lake CH4 flux, representing a key component of the global CH4 budget. Hence, based on a combination of our data and additional literature information considering diel variability across latitudes, we discuss ways to derive a diel variability correction factor for previous measurements made during daytime only.					; Oliveira Sawakuchi, Henrique/ABA-9796-2021; Sieczko, Anna/O-2310-2015; Oliveira Sawakuchi, Henrique/K-6194-2014; Rudberg, David/JMP-4750-2023	Pajala, Gustav/0000-0001-7960-0129; Bastviken, David/0000-0003-0038-2152; Rudberg, David/0000-0003-0934-2077; Oliveira Sawakuchi, Henrique/0000-0002-6815-7261; Schenk, Jonathan/0000-0002-6191-3933; Sieczko, Anna/0000-0003-0472-7840													0027-8424	1091-6490				SEP 1	2020	117	35					21488	21494		10.1073/pnas.2006024117	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2006024117								32817550					WOS:000572974300014
J	Jaworska-Szule, B				Jaworska-Szule, Beata			Impact of Climate Change on Groundwater Resources in a Young Glacial Multi-Aquifer System	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												The aim of this study was to evaluate the trends of climate change on the Kashubian Lake District and to determine the impact of expected trends on groundwater resources. The analysis of trends in temperature and precipitation was conducted for the six-decade history of meteorological measurements at the weather station in Koscierzyna. The analysis shows the trend of temperature increase of +0.0182 degrees C/year. The highest increase in temperature is observed in the months from January to May, and in July and August. Annual precipitation also shows a growing trend. This is on average 1.847 mm/year, while the largest increase relates to the months from January to March and from October to December. These trends may contribute to an increase in the recharge rate. Precipitation grows mainly in the non-growing season. If the current trends are maintained, the sum of precipitation involved in the groundwater recharge will probably increase by 36 mm (5.5%) over the next 50 years. The groundwater flow model (MODFLOW) calculation made for these projections showed primarily a tendency for increased descending seepage between aquifers and a slight decrease in upward flow. The most significant changes are observed in the shallow layer, were spring outflows increases by 12%, and the water table rises by about one meter.																			1230-1485	2083-5906					2015	24	6					2447	2457																WOS:000365931600013
J	Risacher, F; Fritz, B; Hauser, A				Risacher, Francois; Fritz, Bertrand; Hauser, Arturo			Origin of components in Chilean thermal waters	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES												Thermal waters of northern (18 degrees-27 degrees S) and southern (37 degrees-45 degrees S) Chile occur in two very different climatic, geologic and hydrologic environments: arid closed basins with abundant evaporites in the north: humid climate and well drained valleys in the south. The origin and behavior of the main components of the two groups of waters are examined and compared to each other. The modeling of the alteration of volcanic rocks leads to water compositions very different from those observed both in the north and south. In addition to hydrothermal alteration and deep emanations, the Cl/Br ratio reveals a major contribution of saline waters to the two groups: infiltrating brines from salt lakes in the north; seawater in the south. In the north, concentrations of Cl, Br, Na, K, Ca, SO(4), Li, B, Si result from the mixing of alteration waters with recycled brines. Hydrothermal alteration is obscured by this massive saline input, except for Mg. delta(34)S values are consistent with an origin of sulfate from salar brines, which are themselves derived from deep Tertiary gypsum. In the south, two processes account for the composition of thermal waters: mixing of alteration waters with seawater and deep magmatic contribution. The mixing process controls the concentration of Cl, Br, Na, Alk, Si, K, Ca, Mg. Magmatic inputs are detectable for SO(4), Li and B. delta(34)S suggests that sulfate stems from the mixing of alteration waters with either marine SO(4) in coastal waters or with deep SO(2) in inland waters. In both the north and south, the Mg concentration is drastically lowered (<1 mu mol/L) by the probable formation of a chlorite-type mineral. In the south, very small amounts of seawater (<1% in volume) are sufficient to imprint a clear signature on thermal waters. Not only coastal springs are affected by seawater mixing, but also remote inland springs, as far as 150 km from the sea. Subduction of marine sediments in the accretive margin could be the source of the marine imprint in thermal waters of southern Chile. Seawater may be expelled from the subducted lithosphere and incorporated into the mantle source. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Detecting the infrastructural, demographic and climatic changes on macroalgal blooms using cellular automata simulation	20TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION (MODSIM2013)					20th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)	DEC 01-06, 2013	Adelaide, AUSTRALIA	CSIRO, Univ S Australia, Ctr Ind & Appl Math, Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol, GOYDER Inst, Govt S Australia, Australian Math Soc, Australian Math Sci Inst, Simulat Australia, Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl Math				Worldwide, the effects of anthropogenic nutrient loading into estuaries include a shift from sea grass to macroalgae, particularly the "bloom and bust" cycle of the ephemeral Chlorophyta. Macroalgal blooms only occur in spring and summer when rainfall prior to and during this time is low. This study describes temporal and spatial dynamics of nuisance macroalgal blooms in Avoca Lake, an intermittently closed and open lagoon lake (ICOLL) in NSW, Australia and identifies the main factors influencing algal growth in that lagoon. The dynamics are modelled using discrete cellular automata (CA) and a set of algorithms to capture the spread of the blooms. The objective at this stage is to identify the factors that contribute to the spread and ultimately to identify the factors that cause the initial outbreaks. Water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity and bioavailable nutrients (nitrogen and phosphate) were measured, at weekly intervals, throughout the Lake during the major bloom which occurred in late 2012 as these variables are all considered likely candidates for blooms. Salinity and light were identified as two most important factors influencing algal growth; blooms always started at the shallow edges of the lake or around seagrass patches where algae attached to seagrass blades were positioned closer to the surface. No bloom occurred during the same period of the previous year when there was a lot more rainfall and much lower salinity in the ICOLL. Aerial photographs taken on four occasions over this period were digitised to record the extent of macroalgal cover. The CA model is initialised using knowledge of the behavioural dynamics of the algae; notably, that usually they are first observed at the edges of the ICOLL, where the water is warm and the light is good, due to the shallow water level. Later models will be initiated with observed data at the start of the 2012 bloom and validated by comparison of the simulated data with the observed. The CA model presented in this work is a further extension of the model developed by the authors. The discrete-Laplacian description for biomass provided a method to describe the spread and growth of algae, which incorporated currents, seagrass distribution, water depth and other parameters. The results of the present study highlight that when developing a model to predict the occurrence, spread and duration of macroalgal blooms in this ICOLL; such a model must include detailed data on dissolved oxygen, turbidity, salinity and nutrients. Additional complexity arises from the periodic opening of the ICOLL to the ocean. This also influences algal biomass dynamics, and the model will assist with determining the effect of the opening on the dynamics.

We studied four small unproductive lakes in subarctic northern Sweden during one summer season. The production of new biomass in both benthic and pelagic habitats was calculated as the sum of autotrophic production by algae and heterotrophic production by bacteria using allochthonous organic carbon (OC). Whole-lake production of new biomass was dominated by the benthic habitat (86% +/- 4% [mean +/- SD]) and by primary production (77% +/- 9%). Still, heterotrophic bacteria fueled by allochthonous OC constituted a significant portion of the new biomass production in both benthic (19% +/- 11%) and pelagic habitats (51% +/- 24%). In addition, overall net production (primary production minus respiration) was close to zero in the benthic habitats but highly negative (-163 +/- 81 mg C.m(-2).d(-1)) in pelagic regions of all lakes. We conclude (1) that allochthonous OC supported a significant part of total production of new biomass in both pelagic and benthic habitats, (2) that benthic habitats dominated the whole-lake production of new biomass, and (3) that respiration and net CO(2) production dominated the carbon flux of the pelagic habitats and biomass production dominated the benthic carbon flux. Taken together, these findings suggest that previous investigations have greatly underestimated the productivity of clear-water lakes when benthic autotrophic production and metabolism of allochthonous OC have not been measured.

Their effects, however, depend on many factors including host body condition, parasite load and the life cycle of the parasite. More research into how multiple parasite taxa affect host body condition is required and will help us to better understand host-parasite coevolution. We used body condition indices, based on mass-length relationships, to test the effects that abundances and biomasses of six parasite taxa (five trematodes, Apatemon sp., Tylodelphys sp., Stegodexamene anguillae, Telogaster opisthorchis, Coitocaecum parvum, and the nematode Eustrongylides sp.) with different modes of transmission have on the body condition of their intermediate or final fish host, the common bully Gobiomorphus cotidianus in New Zealand. We used two alternative body condition methods, the Scaled Mass Index (SMI) and Fulton's condition factor. General linear and hierarchical partitioning models consistently showed that fish body condition varied strongly across three lakes and seasons, and that most parasites did not have an effect on the two body condition indices. However, fish body condition showed a highly significant humpbacked relationship with the total abundance of all six parasite taxa, mostly driven by Apatemon sp. and S. anguillae, indicating that the effects of these parasites can range from positive to negative as abundance increases. Such a response was also evident in models including total parasite biomass. Our methodological comparison supports the SMI as the most robust mass-length method to examine the effects of parasitic infections on fish body condition, and suggests that linear, negative relationships between host condition and parasite load should not be assumed.					; Maceda, Alberto/F-1185-2010; Maceda-Veiga, Alberto/F-1185-2010; Poulin, Robert/C-3117-2008; Green, Andy/A-5189-2008	Lagrue, Clement/0000-0003-3347-6497; Maceda-Veiga, Alberto/0000-0002-1736-4631; 													1932-6203					DEC 28	2016	11	12							e0168992	10.1371/journal.pone.0168992	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0168992								28030606					WOS:000391222000096

Ecosystem metabolism and greenhouse gas production in a mesotrophic northern temperate lake experiencing seasonal hypoxia	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Many lacustrine systems, despite management efforts to control eutrophication, are hypoxic during stratified periods. Hypoxia is a major concern, not only for its impact on aquatic life but also for its potential to stimulate production of the greenhouse gases, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). We investigated the drivers of hypoxia in Muskegon Lake, a temperate dimictic freshwater estuary that experiences frequent hypolimnetic mixing due to atmospheric forces, riverine inputs, and intrusion of oxic water from coastal upwelling in Lake Michigan. Primary production and respiration (R) rates obtained from a delta O-18 mass balance model were similar to other mesotrophic environments (0.56-26.31 and 0.57-13.15 mmol O-2 m(-3) day(-1), respectively), although high P/R (ae<yen>2 in mid-summer) indicated there is sufficient autochthonous production to support hypoxia development and persistence. The isotopic enrichment factor for respiration (epsilon(obs)) varied markedly and was least negative in August of both sampling years, consistent with high R rates. Hypoxic conditions were associated with accumulation of N2O but not CH4, and emissions of N2O are among the highest reported from lakes. The average N2O site preference value of 25.4aEuro degrees indicates that the majority of N2O was produced by nitrification via hydroxylamine oxidation, despite the presence of resilient hypoxia. While it has been hypothesized that denitrification acts as a sink for N2O in hypoxic lakes, it is clear that Muskegon Lake functions as a strong source of N2O via nitrification. Further considerations of lakes as global sources of N2O thus warrant a closer evaluation of nitrification-fueled N2O production.					; Biddanda, Bopaiah/AAB-1705-2019	Salk, Kateri/0000-0002-9967-2856; 													0168-2563	1573-515X				DEC	2016	131	3					303	319		10.1007/s10533-016-0280-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-016-0280-y													WOS:000391423900004

Live versus artificial bait influences on walleye (Sander vitreus) angler effort and catch rates on Escanaba Lake, Wisconsin, 1993-2015	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Walleye (Sander vitreus) support harvest-oriented fisheries that are generally assumed to be self-regulating, but many walleye populations have declined over time. Regulations (i.e., length or bag limits, closed seasons) commonly used to manage walleye primarily restrict angler effort and exploitation as opposed to influencing catch rates. We evaluated walleye angler compulsory creel survey data from Escanaba Lake, Wisconsin during 1993-2015 to test whether bait type (i.e., live versus artificial) influenced walleye angler effort, probability of a catching a walleye, total catch, catch rates (hereafter, catch per unit effort (CPUE)), and catchability. The number of walleye anglers that used live bait was significantly higher (26,250) than those that used artificial bait (2414). Angler effort differed significantly by bait type (mean live 3.4 +/- 0.04 SE and mean artificial 2.9 +/- 0.1 SE hrs/trip). The use of live bait, the use of a guide, angler effort, walleye density, and month significantly influenced the probability of a catching a walleye and the abundance of catch. CPUE was highest in April-May and declined into the summer. CPUE and catchability (q) were significantly higher for live bait anglers (CPUE mean 0.44 +/- 0.04 SE fish/hr; q mean 0.02 +/- 0.002 SE) compared to artificial bait walleye anglers (CPUE mean 0.19 +/- 0.03 SE fish/hr; q mean 0.008 +/- 0.002 SE). Our results suggest that angler catchability of walleye in Escanaba Lake was dependent on bait type. A live bait restriction may be a viable tool for reducing exploitation in open-access walleye fisheries during population rehabilitation efforts while maintaining angling opportunities.																			0165-7836	1872-6763				NOV	2019	219								105330	10.1016/j.fishres.2019.105330	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2019.105330													WOS:000488300900028

In this study, the composition of bacterial communities in the water and sediment from one of the inlets and outlets of Lake Chaohu in response to spatiotemporal changes was analyzed by Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Substantially distinct bacterial community composition was observed between the water column and sediments in both the Zhaohe (the inlet, C1) and Yuxihe Rivers (the outlet, C2). The phyla of the water samples were Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes, whereas the sediment samples were dominated by Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi and Nitrospirae. The sediment exhibited higher diversity and richness than did the water column at the two sites, with the sediment samples from the Yuxihe River showing higher richness and lower diversity than those from the Zhaohe River. The pattern of spatiotemporal changes indicated the seasonal factor, rather than the region, to be the primary cause of the observed variation in the bacterial structure in Lake Chaohu. In water samples from the two study areas, unclassified genera of Cyanobacteria dominated in winter, with members of unclassified FamilyI and unclassified Cyanobacterium. Moreover, redundancy analysis indicated that water temperature (T), total phosphorus (TP), organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN) were all determined to be related to bacterial community structure. And T and TP were the main factors influencing the water bacterial structure and that OC and TN were the main indicators determining the sediment bacterial structure. The results of this study may be useful for indicating the tendency of bacteria to respond to environmental changes in Lake Chaohu.

The phylogenetic comparison with the currently available rDNA data set showed that our sequences fall into 16 clusters, which otherwise include bacterial rDNA sequences of primarily freshwater and soil, but not marine, origin. Six of the clusters were affiliated with the alpha, four were affiliated with the beta, and one was affiliated with the gamma subclass of the Proteobacteria; four were affiliated with the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides group; and one was affiliated with the class Actinobacteria (formerly known as the high-G+C gram-positive bacteria), The latter cluster (hgcI) is monophyletic and so far includes only sequences directly retrieved from aquatic environments. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes specific for the hgcI cluster showed abundances of up to 1.7 x 10(5) cells ml(-1) in Lake Gossenkollesee, with strong seasonal fluctuations, and high abundances in the two other lakes investigated. Cell size measurements revealed that Actinobacteria in Lake Gossenkollesee can account for up to 63% of the bacterioplankton biomass, A combination of phylogenetic analysis and FISH was used to reveal 16 globally distributed sequence clusters and to confirm the broad distribution, abundance, and high biomass of members of the class Actinobacteria in freshwater ecosystems.

The Daqing River Basin (DRB), where the New Area is located, has become a new focus of hydrological scientists. The vegetation cover plays a key role in hydrological and biogeochemical cycles, serving as a reference to understand the ecological environment and water circulation status of the watershed. To analyse the current situation of climate and vegetation changes in the DRB, kriging interpolation, moving average, trend analysis of Theil-Sen median, and Mann-Kendall statistical test were used based on ground-based observation data and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. The annual mean values of NDVI showed a significant upward trend from 2000 to 2015. The fluctuations in seasonal NDVI values followed this trend correspondingly to various extents. The variations in NDVI value positively correlated with those in temperature, both on the annual scale and during summer seasons (P <= 0.05). A large improvement in the vegetation cover of DRB was observed (54.21% of the areas), mainly distributed in the northeast of Mountainous Areas of Daqing River Basin and West Plain of Baiyangdian Lake. The findings might be helpful to understand the water and energy flux cycling in the changing environment of this region, providing guiding information on river basin management and the planning and construction of New Area.

Phytoplankton plays an important role in maintaining the structure and function of these reservoir ecosystems. Understanding of seasonal succession in phytoplankton communities and its driving factors is essential for effective water quality management in drinking-water reservoirs. In this study, water samples were collected monthly at the surface layers of riverine, transitional, and lacustrine zones from May 2010 to April 2011 in Tingxi Reservoir, southeast China. The phytoplankton showed distinct seasonal shifts in community structure at both taxonomic and functional levels. Cyanophyta was the dominant group in summer, especially species of Raphidiopsis in May and Aphanizomenon in June, and cyanobacterial dominance was promoted by both warmer conditions and excessive nutrients loading. Cyanophyta was gradually replaced by Cryptophyta (e.g., Chroomonas caudata) in abundance and by Bacillariophyta (Fragilaria sp. or Synedra sp. and Melosira sp.) in biomass with decreasing temperature. It appeared that seasonal shifts in phytoplankton composition were closely related to climate, nutrient status, and hydrology in this reservoir. Our partial RDA results clearly showed that water temperature and nutrients (TN and TP) were the most critical factors driving phytoplankton community shift in the abundance and biomass data, respectively. Further, with the global warming, cyanobacterial blooms may increase in distribution, duration, and intensity. In our study, the abundance and biomass of cyanobacteria had significant and positive correlations with temperature and phosphorus. Therefore, a stricter limit on nutrient input should be a priority in watershed management to protect drinking water from the effects of cyanobacterial blooms, especially in high-temperature period.

J	JOHANNSSON, OE; BEAVER, JL				JOHANNSSON, OE; BEAVER, JL			ROLE OF ALGAE IN THE DIET OF CHIRONOMUS-PLUMOSUS F SEMIREDUCTUS FROM THE BAY OF QUINTE, LAKE-ONTARIO	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The importance of algae and different algal species to the chironomid diet was investigated through examination of the guts of chironomids taken from 5 locations in Big Bay (Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario) at 6 times during the ice-free period. A comparison of the density and condition of algal cells at the 2 ends of the gut provided information on the digestibility of each algal species and the algal biomass assimilated by the chironomids. Diatoms and 2 spp. of green algae were assimilated over much of the summer, but the blue-green algae were digested only late in the season when their populations were aged and/or dying. In terms of energy contribution, diatoms (especially Stephanodiscus spp. and Melosira spp.) were most important in May (99% of all algal biomass assimilated), Aug. (98%) and Oct. (92%); the blue-green species Microcystis aerguinosa was predominant in Sept. (76%). Only a few small greens were assimilated in June and July. The contribution of algae as a food source to chironomid energetics was small, and reached a maximum in Aug. and Sept. (15-34%). Bacteria are probably a more important food source.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1983	107	3					237	247		10.1007/BF00036693	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00036693													WOS:A1983RU37300006

The alpine lake sediments from Daye Lake in the Qinling Mountains, east-central China, were used to explore the influence of climate, vegetation and human activity on fires since the LGM, based on charcoals and black carbon. During the last glacial period, fire activity was mostly controlled by regional aridity under a weak East Asian summer monsoon, while human-induced fires were commonly dominated in the late Holocene. Fire activity was found to be linked to biomass through temperature variability. The biofuel dominated by conifers induced high intensity fires in the last glacial, and herbs contributed more to the high fire frequency over the mid-late Holocene. With predicted future rising temperatures, increased vegetation cover and extreme climate events may increase the fire risk in the region.

Variability of the horizontal gradients of the air and the water surface temperatures in the vernal frontal zone period of Lake Ladoga	OCEANOLOGY												Every year, the during springtime heating conditions, the seasonal thermal frontal zone appears in Lake Ladoga. It features high horizontal water temperature gradients. The coastal waters, stably stratified in density, interact with the waters of the open lake that are unstably stratified because of the free convection developing in the temperature range between 0A degrees C and the maximum density of the water at 4A degrees C. In Lake Ladoga, the advance of the vernal frontal zone lasts about 7-8 weeks from mid-May to the beginning of July. Both the water temperature and air temperature distributions over the water's surface show that large spatial temperature ranges exist in the vernal front reaching more than 11A degrees C. We investigated the spatial horizontal gradients of the water's surface and the air temperature using a spatial grid with a resolution of 5 km. The surface water temperature and the air temperature gradients were compared with each other as well as with the temperatures in the region of varying depths. During the spring peak of the frontal activity in Lake Ladoga, most of the fronts feature mean temperatures greater than 4A degrees C. This indicates that the thermal bar marks the offshore edge of the most extensive frontal zone.					; Naumenko, Mikhail/K-9415-2013; Гузиватый, Вадим/AFN-5197-2022	Guzivaty, Vadim/0000-0001-6359-9290; Naumenko, Mikhail/0000-0002-3055-2629; 													0001-4370					NOV	2012	52	6					735	740		10.1134/S0001437012060082	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0001437012060082													WOS:000312563700003

Examined species included sooty tern (Sterna fuscata), brown noddy (Anous stolidus), wedge-tailed shearwater (Puffinus pacificus), brown booby (Sula leucogaster), and red-footed booby (S. sula). For both locations and all metals we found significant interspecific differences. There were some consistent patterns within sites: selenium levels were two to three times higher in brown noddies compared to the other species; mercury levels in wedge-tailed shearwaters were two to five times higher than those in sooty terns or brown noddies, but were similar to levels in boobies. Cadmium levels were generally low. The significant interspecific differences in metal levels indicate that the levels for some species may not be background levels. Hawaiian sooty terns had higher lead levels than those from Johnston, but the noddies had higher selenium and mercury levels and shearwaters had higher lead and mercury levels on Johnston. Sooty terns and brown noddies had higher lead levels in Hawaii and Johnston Atoll than in Australia or the Caribbean.																			0730-7268						1992	11	6					815	822		10.1897/1552-8618(1992)11[815:LCSAMI]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1897/1552-8618(1992)11[815:LCSAMI]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1992HY97600010

To identify the drivers of biomass dynamics for epilithic algae, a 20-month study was conducted in mountain streams in Taiwan, an area characterised by different levels of riparian vegetation coverage and agricultural activity, in which a process-based model was optimally fit to field data. We found that episodic typhoon-induced floods were the major drivers shaping the seasonal variations in algal biomass. Flow-induced detachment was frequently observed in periods of higher algal biomass. In contrast, an increased flow stimulated algal growth during periods with slower flow rates. Increased temperature stimulated algal growth at sites with an open canopy cover and higher light availability but constrained biomass at sites with dense canopy shading. Overall, scraper biomass exerted less influence on algal biomass than did environmental factors. The effects of grazing were visible only at the pristine, low-stream-order site in winter. The effects of minimal algal biomass required for recovery was comparable to environmental factors only at sites with intermediate canopy cover, moderate discharge, and higher nutrient concentrations. We suggest that agricultural activity and riparian vegetation can affect epilithic algal biomass in subtropical mountain streams.

Here we investigated the relative contribution of river flooding, hurricanes, and cold fronts on elevation change in the prograding Wax Lake Delta (WLD). Sediment surface elevation was measured across 87 plots, eight times from February 2008 to August 2011. The high peak discharge river floods in 2008 and 2011 resulted in the greatest mean net elevation gain of 5.4 to 4.9 cm over each flood season, respectively. The highest deltaic wetland sediment retention (13.5% of total sediment discharge) occurred during the 2008 river flood despite lower total and peak discharge compared to 2011. Hurricanes Gustav and Ike resulted in a total net elevation gain of 1.2 cm, but the long-term contribution of hurricane derived sediments to deltaic wetlands was estimated to be just 22% of the long-term contribution of large river floods. Winter cold front passage resulted in a net loss in elevation that is equal to the elevation gain from lower discharge river floods and was consistent across years. This amount of annual loss in elevation from cold fronts could effectively negate the long-term land building capacity within the delta without the added elevation gain from both high and low discharge river floods. The current lack of inclusion of cold front elevation loss in most predictive numerical models likely overestimates the land building capacity in areas that experience similar forcings to WLD.

This lack of detailed understanding likely exists because suitable studies of meteorological variables, hydrologic processes and chemical characteristics of water bodies downstream from rock glaciers are unavailable. In this study, a rock-glacier pond in the North-Western Italian Alps was studied on a weekly basis for the ice-free seasons 2014 and 2015 by observing the meteorological variables (air temperature, snowmelt, rainfall) assumed to drive the export of solute-enriched waters from the rock glacier and the hydrochemical response of the pond (water temperature as a proxy of rock-glacier discharge, stablewater isotopes, major ions and selected trace elements). An intra-seasonal pattern of increasing solute export associated with higher rock-glacier discharge was found. Specifically, rainfall, after the winter snowpack depletion and prolonged periods of atmospheric temperature above 0 degrees C, was found to be the primary driver of solute export from the rock glacier during the ice-free season. This occurs likely through the flushing of isotopically- and geochemically-enriched icemelt, causing concomitant increases in the rock-glacier discharge and the solute export (SO42-, Mg2+, Ca2+, Ni, Mn, Co). Moreover, flushing of microbially-active sediments can cause increases in NO3- export. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Cambi, C; Dragoni, W; Valigi, D				Cambi, C; Dragoni, W; Valigi, D			Water management in low permeability catchments and in times of climatic change: the case of the Nestore River (Western Central Italy)	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												The analysis of the historical data series for rainfall and temperature in Central Italy indicates that a slight increase in temperature is occurring in this area, accompanied by a decrease of up to 3-4 mm/year in rainfall, rather significant when compared to the local average of 600-800 mm/year of rain. The causes of these trends are still not clear so that the persistency and intensity of these climatic variations in the future cannot be defined with any certainty. Nonetheless, when considering plans for water management, it is necessary to bear in mind that the duration of warm periods in the past and the increase in greenhouse gases suggest that these trends will persist. This situation is particularly worrying in an area where the Mediterranean climate-with hot and dry summers-causes the summer discharge of rivers to be very low or even nil, especially in the catchments-very common in Central Italy-made up of low permeability flysch-type rocks, with no significant aquifers. As an exemplification of the difficulties involved in water management and of the way to try to solve them, the authors present here the case of an artificial lake used to store water for the cooling of a thermo-electric power plant. The water from the Nestore River, located in an area with low-permeability, flysch-type rocks, fills the lake. A specially set up model was calibrated to simulate the lake level changes under different climatic conditions. The model indicated that a certain portion of the basin is enough for the needs of the power plant, even with severely limiting restrictions regarding the releasing of the minimum acceptable flow into the natural channel, and in the most pessimistic hypotheses of climatic variations.

Influence of macronutrient and iron enrichment on phytoplankton productivity and community dynamics: an in situ microcosm study in a drinking water supply reservoir	INLAND WATERS												This study examines the influence of macronutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and trace metals (iron and manganese) on phytoplankton productivity and community composition in Prospect Reservoir, a key component of the drinking water supply for Greater Sydney, Australia. In situ microcosm bioassays were set up at 2 sites (shallow and pelagic) during the Austral growing season (early autumn), and the responses of phytoplankton to various nutrient enrichment scenarios were assessed following an 8-day incubation period. Initial conditions and nutrient additions were compared by analyzing productivity indicators including chlorophyll a (Chl-a), total phytoplankton, and potentially toxic cyanobacteria biovolume. Phytoplankton community changes were identified using functional group classification and hierarchical cluster analysis. Productivity was colimited by nitrogen and phosphorus. Addition of these nutrients was associated with significant growth and dominance of group F, representing green algae such as Scenedesmus and Oocystis. Significant growth was also observed in meso-eutrophic groups that included the nuisance cyanobacteria Microcystis (M). An additional enhancement in Chl-a and phytoplankton biovolume in the pelagic site was observed when iron was added. Group D, represented by the nuisance taxon Synedra, seemed to dominate in low-P conditions. The study highlights the importance of informed eutrophication management strategies that address nutrient dynamics including macronutrient colimitation, macronutrient ratios, and iron to mitigate the risks associated with increased phytoplankton productivity and nuisance phytoplankton growth in drinking water reservoirs. This knowledge is particularly significant given the projected increase in macronutrient and trace metal micronutrient inputs and climate change-driven events such as bush fires and flooding.

Therefore, water characterisation and monitoring over time is important for human health and aquatic life. The basic understanding of hydrochemistry can be extracted by a trilinear piper diagram. The study also intends to develop hydro-chemical analysis for water quality at various locations in Uttarakhand to represent four major river catchments. The study attempted over 50 locations from 2010 to 2019 during pre and post-monsoon seasons. Four anions and four cations were used to understand hydrogeochemical facies. Result reveals that the most dominant hydrogeochemical facies were Ca-Mg-HCO3 in the entire region followed by Ca-Mg-Cl or Ca-Mg-SO4 facies due to limestone-dominant geology. Na-Cl or Na-SO4 facies enhanced due to agriculture activities while NaHCO3 facies due to the rapid weathering processes along the river course over the period. The study recommended for the area where the water type is either Na-Cl or Na-SO4 or Na-HCO3, intensive water resource planning should be implemented. These areas are highly vulnerable to human health costs.

All three species of Chaoborus (C. punctipennis, C. trivittatus, C. flavicans) found in Chub Lake (south-central Ontario), were analyzed seasonally. One species, C. punctipennis, was collected and analyzed from all lakes. Smaller Chaoborus tended to have higher Cd concentrations (mu-g Cd/g dry weight), and lower Cd burdens (ng Cd/Animal) than larger Chaoborus. The Cd concentrations of Chaoborus in Chub Lake were lowest during the summer, which coincided with the fastest growth of the organisms. The Cd burdens differed between species, which was attributed to differences in their asynchronous life histories. Cadmium burdens and concentrations were significantly lower in the organisms from northwestern Ontario than those from south-central Ontario. Lower atmospheric deposition rates, lower Cd concentrations in the lake water, as well as life history differences, may explain these results.																			0090-4341					OCT	1992	23	3					370	374		10.1007/BF00216247	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00216247								1456783					WOS:A1992JM34000015

Trace Metal Stream Contamination in a Post Peak Water Context: Lessons from the Cordillera Blanca, Peru	ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY												As a result of climate warming and glacier recession, glacierized watersheds will experience a decrease in dry season discharge and an increase in wet season discharge, with negative consequences for water quality. The glacierized Rio Santa watershed in Peru provides a unique opportunity to study these concerns, because it drains the mountain range with the highest density of glaciers in the tropics. The mountain range has already passed peak water due to glacier retreat, and previous studies have reported high concentrations of dissolved trace metals in the Rio Santa. During summer 2013, 40 sites along the Rio Santa watershed were sampled for river bed sediments. In addition, water samples were collected at a single location in the Rio Santa over a period of 1 year. A sequential extraction was performed on the sediments and analyzed for Al, As, Cd, Fe, Pb, and Zn concentrations. Results show a chemostatic behavior of studied trace metals and present comparable distributions of metals among phases in the Rio Santa and its tributaries. These results suggest that at least a portion of the surface sediment contamination from trace metals originates from a transfer of primary particles from contaminated tributaries. In a post peak water context, this study implies that the increase in wet season discharge related to glaciers may represent a risk of contamination spread associated with sediment transport enhancement.

Grace; Kerby, Jeffrey T.; Post, Eric			Arctic climate shifts drive rapid ecosystem responses across the West Greenland landscape	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Prediction of high latitude response to climate change is hampered by poor understanding of the role of nonlinear changes in ecosystem forcing and response. While the effects of nonlinear climate change are often delayed or dampened by internal ecosystem dynamics, recent warming events in the Arctic have driven rapid environmental response, raising questions of how terrestrial and freshwater systems in this region may shift in response to abrupt climate change. We quantified environmental responses to recent abrupt climate change in West Greenland using long-term monitoring and paleoecological reconstructions. Using >40 years of weather data, we found that after 1994, mean June air temperatures shifted 2.2 degrees C higher and mean winter precipitation doubled from 21 to 40 mm; since 2006, mean July air temperatures shifted 1.1 degrees C higher. Nonlinear environmental responses occurred with or shortly after these abrupt climate shifts, including increasing ice sheet discharge, increasing dust, advancing plant phenology, and in lakes, earlier ice out and greater diversity of algal functional traits. Our analyses reveal rapid environmental responses to nonlinear climate shifts, underscoring the highly responsive nature of Arctic ecosystems to abrupt transitions.					; Fowler, Rachel/JFA-1083-2023; Yde, Jacob/M-8839-2017; , Marian/JSL-4087-2023; Pla-Rabes, Sergi/J-9209-2012; McGowan, Suzanne/GZB-0118-2022; Heathcote, Adam/I-9253-2019; Telling, Jon/HZJ-3880-2023; Osburn, Chris/A-9339-2010; Mernild, Sebastian H./M-5516-2013	Saros, Jasmine/0000-0002-7652-9985; Fowler, Rachel/0000-0002-4906-6372; Telling, Jon/0000-0002-8180-0979; Pla-Rabes, Sergi/0000-0003-3532-9466; Kerby, Jeffrey/0000-0002-2739-9096; Heathcote, Adam/0000-0002-9633-9548; Bullard, Joanna/0000-0002-2030-0188; Northington, Robert/0000-0002-1347-0971; Osburn, Christopher/0000-0002-9334-4202; Mernild, Sebastian H./0000-0003-0797-3975													1748-9326					JUL	2019	14	7							074027	10.1088/1748-9326/ab2928	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab2928													WOS:000475794700004

The following helminths were found (listed according to frequency): Acanthocephalus lucii Muller, 1776; Camallanus truncatus (Rudolphi, 1814); Proteocephalus percae (Muller, 1780); Bunodera luciopercae (Muller, 1776); C. lacustris (Zoega, 1776); A. anguillae (Muller, 1780); P. cernuae (Gmelin, 1790) and Nicolla skrjabini (Ivanickij, 1928). The Camallanus spp. and A. anguillae were only found in perch, and P. cernuae and N. skrjabini were found only in pope. Incidence, intensity and seasonal variation in the presence of the helminth species are discussed. To determine if seasonal rhythms are present, it is necessary to study the life cycle of the parasite and life conditions and food relations of the hosts. B. luciopercae and P. percae exhibited seasonal cycles in occurrence and abundance. Both species are present as egg-producing specimens only during spring. There were no significant differences of intensity and incidence between male and female fishes, whereas such differences exist in a qualified sense between old and young fish.																			0044-5231						1979	203	3-4					241	253																WOS:A1979HY13400011

Fecal, soil and food plant samples were analyzed. Levels of Pb were normalized using Al concentrations in order to separate the effect of possible ingestion of Pb shot from that of soil or sediment accidentally ingested with food. All concentrations are expressed on a dry weight basis. Geometric means of Pb content in the feces of LWfG were 6.24 mg/kg at Evros Delta and 7.34 mg/kg at Lake Kerkini (maximum values of 28.61 mg/kg and 36.68 mg/kg, respectively); for fecal samples of GWfG geometric means were 2.39 mg/kg at Evros Delta and 6.90 mg/kg at Kerkini (corresponding maximum values of 25.09 mg/kg and 42.26 mg/kg). Soil Pb was in the range of 5.2-60.2 mg/kg (geometric mean = 22.6 mg/kg) for the Evros Delta and between 13.4 and 64.9 mg/kg (geometric mean = 28.1 mg/kg) for Kerkini. A general linear model fitted to the data showed that Pb levels were very closely dependent on Al levels in the feces from both species and at both sites indicating soil or sediment were the only significant source of Pb; species and site, as well as their interaction, were not statistically significant factors. For both species and at both sites exposure to Pb was evidently very mild and the observed levels of Pb were well below the proposed thresholds for lethal or sublethal effects of Pb poisoning. Soil ingestion appeared to gradually increase from October to December for LWfG at Kerkini, corresponding to a gradual depletion of their food source. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Encina, L; Rodríguez-Ruiz, A				Encina, L; Rodríguez-Ruiz, A			Abundance and distribution of a brown trout (Salmo trutta, L.) population in a remote high mountain lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Brown trout ( Salmo trutta) population of a remote high mountain lake ( Lake Redo, Pyrenees, 2240 m above sea level) were studied during autumn using hydroacoustic techniques. This acoustic technique was for the first time used on fish at such high altitude in Spain. Sampling using multimesh nets fish catches and echosounding recording were carried out in September 1998. Mean density of fish was estimated to be 1.82 fish per 1000 m(3) ( 597 fish ha(-1)). The results exhibited mainly a littoral habitat, with the brown trout being preferentially in the 10 - 25 m deep layer, where the water was warmer and the richness and diversity of macroinvertebrates higher. The sampling by hydroacoustic technique found a length frequency range of fish higher than the multimesh gill nets but both of them estimated similar fish proportion for the common length range. The more frequent target strength (TS) for the population was - 38 dB ( TS range - 37 to - 39 dB). Good correlation was found between TS frequency distribution obtained by echosounding and that predicted by means of a model based on the log of the fish total length from multimesh gill nets captures.					; Rodriguez Ruiz, Amadora/LKN-6032-2024	Encina Encina, Maria Lourdes/0000-0002-8218-3327; Rodriguez Ruiz, Amadora/0000-0002-6944-4633													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2003	493	1-3					35	42		10.1023/A:1025473309016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1025473309016													WOS:000184957700005

In this paper, we investigate the chemical evolution in these lakes and the pro-duction of chemical sediments by salt precipitation via evaporation. Water samples from tributary springs and three lakes (Magadi, Nasikie Engida and Natron) have been experimentally studied by in-situ X-ray diffraction during evaporation experiments to characterize the sequence of mineral precipitation. These data are com-plemented by ex-situ diffraction studies, chemical analyses and thermodynamic hydrochemical calculations producing detailed information on the activity of all solution species and the saturation state of all minerals potentially generated by the given composition. Major minerals precipitating from these samples are sodium carbonates/bicarbonates as well as halite. The CO3/HCO3 ratio, controlled by pH, is the main factor defining the Na-carbonates precipitation sequence: in lake brines where CO3/HCO3 > 1, trona precipitates first whereas in hot springs, where CO3/HCO3 MUCH LESS-THAN 1, nahcolite precipitates instead of trona, which forms later via partial disso-lution of nahcolite. Precipitation of nahcolite is possible only at lower pH values (pCO2 higher than-2.7) explaining the distribution of trona and nahcolite in current lakes and the stratigraphic sequences. Later, during evaporation, thermonatrite precipitates, normally at the same time as halite, at a very high pH (>11.2) after significant depletion of HCO3- due to trona precipitation. The precipitation of these soluble minerals increases the pH of the brine and is the main factor contributing to the hyperalkaline and hypersaline character of the lakes. Villiaumite, sylvite, alkaline earth carbonates, fluorapatite and silica are also predicted to precipitate, but most of them have not been observed in evaporation experiments, either because of the small amount of precipitates produced, kinetic effects delaying the nucleation of some phases, or by biologically induced effects in the lake chemistry that are not considered in our calculations. Even in these cases, the chemical composition in the corresponding ions allows for discussion on their accumulation and the eventual precipitation of these phases. The coupling of in-situ and ex-situ experiments and geochemical modelling is key to understanding the hydro-geochemical and hydroclimatic conditions of soda lakes, evaporite settings, and potentially soda oceans of early Earth and other extraterrestrial bodies.

Diapause eggs synchronously hatched in the same manner as the subitaneous eggs in normal lake water under both light and dark conditions. However, anoxic condition and coverage by the bottom sediments completely suppressed the hatching. The eggs exposed to anoxic water survived for at least 1 month, whereas those buried in the sediments remained viable for more than 5 months. These results suggest that the diapause eggs buried in the lake-bottom sediments will continue to be dormant even if the refractory phase is completed unless they are resuspended into the water column.																			0278-0372					FEB	1992	12	1					51	56		10.2307/1548718	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1548718													WOS:A1992HC68000006

A series of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and radiocarbon ages from sediment cores demonstrate that there has been continuous deposition of lacustrine sediments throughout the last 65 ka in Lake Gerdizty, a lake basin situated on the eastern foothills of the Urals. Below the lacustrine sequence are two till beds; the uppermost (unit B) was probably deposited by a large mountain-centred glacier complex that covered the lake basin during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 4. This till bed might be a counterpart of the Usa Moraine in the western foothills of the Polar Urals, which is dated with OSL- and Be-10 cosmogenic nuclide methods to between 68 and 58 ka, consistent with the OSL ages from the lowermost lacustrine sediments in Lake Gerdizty. During this glaciation some of the northern Uralian outlet glaciers probably merged with the adjacent Barents-Kara Ice Sheet that reached onto the adjacent lowlands forming large ice-dammed lakes on both sides of the Ural Mountains. The equilibrium line altitude (ELA) on the local ice cap was then at least 1200 m lower than at present. The pollen stratigraphy in Lake Gerditzy reflects an open tundra and steppe-like vegetation throughout MIS 3-2 (60-11,7 ka). The first significant change in vegetation, shown by an increase of dwarf-shrub communities of Salix and Betula, took place during the Lateglacial at around 15 ka or shortly after. Birch and spruce trees approached the area for the first time soon after the Holocene transition similar to 11.7 ka, and became dominant elements in the vegetation after a few hundred years. Our reconstruction suggests a very cold summer climate during MIS 4 and presumably also during the preceding MIS 5b (95-85 ka) glaciation, probably amplified by the large ice-dammed lakes that existed during these two glaciations. A somewhat milder climate prevailed during MIS 3 (60-25 ka), but a treeless vegetation nevertheless suggests that mean summer temperatures did not exceed 10-12 degrees C before the earliest Holocene.

Sediment samples originated from sites with a differentiated human influence starting with the unpolluted areas (the Bialowieza Forest/Puszcza Bialowieska, the so-called "green lungs of Poland") to the areas in the neighbourhood of small towns in northeastern Poland. Marked differences in pollution levels of the above areas were observed. The PAH contents range from 21-600 mug/kg, with a dominant share of low molecular PAHs. The sediment pollution level with trace metals was relatively low. None of the metals determined (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) occurred in an amount that could have created a risk to water organisms.

This paper reports the periodicities of the hydroclimate variations reconstructed from a lacustrine sequence at Tiancun section (TC section) in the Luoyang Basin within the Central Plains of China and the sequence covers the first half of the Holocene. Our reconstruction shows that the hydroclimate variations at the TC section during the period from -10,135 and - 5890 cal. yr BP were well corresponding with the effective soil moisture variations recorded by the stalagmite & delta;13C sequence at the Magou Cave. This corresponding relationship suggests that when the effective soil moisture increases (i.e., more negative & delta;13C values), the ratio of evaporation over precipitation in the paleolake at the TC section decreased, resulting in lower CaCO3 content. It also suggests that when the effective soil moisture increases, more inflowing water entered the paleolake, resulting in coarser sediments. Our reconstruction also shows that the hydroclimate variations or lake level variations in the Luoyang Basin were characterized by millennial-scale quasi-periodicities that were most likely paced by the changes in ITCZ (Inter-tropical Convergent Zone) position and also by alterations in ENSO-like phase. And, both (ITCZ and ENSO) were most likely regulated by the solar activity. Our further analysis shows that the hydroclimate in the Luoyang Basin also experienced centennial-scale variations. Specifically, the grain size data express the following cycles: 692-year, 538-year, 217-year, 170-year and 123-year, all at the 99% confidence level. And, the CaCO3 content data express the following cycles: 202-year, 184-year, 169-year and 85year, all at the 99% confidence level. These cycles are approximately coincident with the widely-reported solaractivity cycles.

The mid-Holocene climatic transition in the Mediterranean: Causes and consequences	HOLOCENE												In the Mediterranean there is often no clear time gap separating an early-Holocene period of nature-dominated environmental change from a human-dominated late-Holocene one. This mid-Holocene 'melange' has been the subject of debates that have often been polarised between support for climatic causation and those favouring anthropogenic explanations for changes in vegetation, river flooding, wildfire regimes, etc. One way to shed light on the causes of mid-Holocene landscape changes is to focus on natural archives, such as lake and cave isotopes, the records of which can be unambiguously attributed to climatic forcing. These primary climate proxies can then be compared and contrasted with secondary or response variables, such as pollen and microcharcoal data, which can be the product of either climate changes or human activity or both, ideally using a multiproxy approach. In addition, synthesised primary palaeoclimate data can be compared with regional-scale climate modelling simulations. Both model output and proxy data suggest an east-west division in Mediterranean climate history. They indicate that the eastern Mediterranean experienced an increase in winter-season precipitation during the early Holocene, followed by an oscillatory decline after similar to 6 ka BP. In western parts of the Mediterranean, early-Holocene changes in precipitation were smaller in magnitude and less coherent spatially, and maximum increases occurred during the mid Holocene, around 6-3 ka BP, before declining to present-day values. Coincident with and partly stimulated by these climatic changes, complex societies developed across the Mediterranean, particularly in eastern parts of the basin during the Bronze Age. In consequence, by the mid-first millennium BC, human-induced land cover conversion, a drier and more variable climate, and changed fire regimes combined to establish typical sclerophyllous vegetation and landscapes in the circum-Mediterranean region.					; Sadori, Laura/E-4774-2015	Brayshaw, David/0000-0002-3927-4362; Sadori, Laura/0000-0002-2774-6705													0959-6836	1477-0911				FEB	2011	21	1					3	13		10.1177/0959683610388058	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683610388058													WOS:000286591100001

However, the available understanding of the migration properties of W in lake sediments under various habitats is still limited. This study was designed to evaluate variations in the concentrations of soluble W, manganese (Mn), and iron (Fe) in the summer season by applying a high-resolution Peeper sampling device. According to the results, soluble W concentrations and release fluxes were higher in the pore water of sediments in algaedominated lake areas than in areas dominated by aquatic plants. This result indicates that the competition for adsorption between algae-derived dissolved organic matter and W, as well as the reductive dissolution caused by dissolved organic matter on Fe (III)/Mn (IV) (hydroxyl) oxides, contributes to the release of W from lake sediments. W uptake by aquatic plants and in-situ formation of Fe (III)/Mn (IV) (hydroxyl) oxides might be the primary factor that controls W release from lake sediments. Aquatic plants can effectively control W release from sediments. The findings of this work provide a scientific basis for the effective control of W release from shallow lake sediments.

Fish Structure in Channel Networks of a Large Anabranching Floodplain: Effect of Isolation/Connection Processes	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Channel networks of floodplain rivers are the main routes for water, sediment, organic matter, and aquatic organisms between main channels and lakes, playing a substantial role in floodplain dynamics. Despite their importance most investigations in large floodplain rivers focus on main channels and lentic water bodies. This research deals with fish assemblage variations in different lotic sites (scour holes and straight reaches) of one of the many channels which shape the wide anabranching floodplain of the middle reach of the Parana River. We considered the influence of environmental factors, such as hydro-geomorphological features and water quality of the channel, connections with surrounding lentic water bodies, seasonality, and interannual flow variations. The results showed two main ecological patterns closely related to floodplain connectivity. In-channel habitat heterogeneity has low influence on fish assemblages when minor channels are connected to significant flooded areas (sampling period 2013-2016). Spatial or temporal predictions of fish structure during these stages are not easy due to the interaction of several environmental factors. However, during very low water levels (winter of 2018) most lentic areas become isolated from the nearby channel network, and floodplain fish are forced to move into the numerous scour holes of the floodplain channels where water conditions resemble those in lentic habitats. Our work highlights the importance of in-channel characteristics of floodplain river networks and their crucial role for fish conservation, particularly during very low water stages.					; Blettler, Martin/K-3795-2017	Rabuffetti, Ana Pia/0000-0003-0106-0876; Latosinski, Francisco/0009-0001-6077-4695; Abrial, Elie/0000-0003-4563-5512; Blettler, Martin/0000-0001-5837-5241													0043-1397	1944-7973				DEC	2019	55	12					10993	11006		10.1029/2019WR025063	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019WR025063		DEC 2019											WOS:000503778400001

This paper reviews data for 1983-2002, with a focus on summer, and uses regression analysis to identify predictors of lake phosphorus concentration, cyanobacteria filament concentration and odor production. Cattle were identified as the main source of excess tributary phosphorus, but lake phosphorus was significantly influenced by factors other than tributary phosphorus, including lake level, lake bottom temperature and wind. Likewise, cyanobacteria filament concentration was significantly influenced by factors other than lake phosphorus, including sunshine, air temperature and lake-bottom temperature.

Dissolved phosphate in the water column is fairly homogeneous, at about 35 mu g P/L. Particulate P shows larger variability, 30-50 mu g/L. The main inputs of dissolved phosphate into the lake are diffusion from bottom sediments (58%) and the Jordan River inflow (41%). Input from springs is negligible (1%). Biological uptake is a minor removal pathway because in the present Dead Sea, primary production takes place only when major floods occur and dilute the upper layer, about once in 10 years. When this happens, only about 200 ton P, out of a whole-lake reservoir of ca. 5000 ton P, are removed from the biologically active upper layer of about 7 m. Chemical removal pathways, not yet investigated, such as coprecipitation with authigenic aragonite, could be of importance. The average ammonia concentration in the water column has gradually increased from 5.9 mg/L in 1960 to 8.9 mg/L, in 1991. Diffusion from the bottom sediments is a major source of ammonia to the Dead Sea. The annual input from freshwater inflows has been of lesser importance in the 1960s and 1970s. A pollution-derived increase in the ammonia concentration of the Jordan River in the 1980s may partially explain the concomitant rise in the ammonia load of the lake. It is also suggested that following the 1979 overturn, and the yearly turnovers of the 1980s, ammonia might have been produced within the oxygenated water column by mineralization. Nitrate concentration was very low, 20 mu g N/L, in the 1960s and increased to 0.2 to 0.5 mg/L in 1981. This increase is shown to be due to human pollution of the Jordan River. We conclude that nutrient concentration in the Dead Sea water column is controlled by physical and chemical factors, whereas biological effects are minimal.

Morpho-stratigraphic characterization of a tufa mound complex in the Spanish Pyrenees using ground penetrating radar and trenching, implications for studies in Mars	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												The Isona tufa mound complex (ITMC), associated with artesian springs of the Areny-Montsec aquifer, Spanish Pyrenees, is a potential analog for water constructed landforms on Mars. We used Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), trenching, sedimentological description of exposures, and radiocarbon and U-series dating methods for the geological characterization of the ITMC. Preliminary geomorphological mapping combined with sedimentological analyses permitted the recognition of the different facies and their spatial distribution. GPR surveys conducted next to an outcrop and a trench provided electromagnetic wave velocity in tufas (0.09 and 0.11 m ns(-1)) and determined the correspondence of the radar signatures with fades types. This was used to reconstruct the tufas internal structure and the depositional stages for two different contexts: (1) an upper unit representing the morphostratigraphic record of paleosprings - Tufa 1 - composed of relict tufa mounds older than 350 ka BP; and (2) a lower unit - Tufa 3 - associated with groundwater aquifer outlets (Basturs Lakes). The GPR data allowed depicting the signatures for the vent, pool, rimstone, palustrine, dam, cascade and slope facies. A relationship was inferred between the age of the tufas and the radar signature, in terms of relative amplitude and signal attenuation. Older dry tufas with advanced diagenesis and karstification are characterized by well-defined GPR reflectors and lower attenuation than younger tufas, associated with aquifer discharge and shallower water tables. U-series and radiocarbon ages obtained from the Basturs Lakes tufas indicate that these have been active since 106 ka BP during both cold and mild Marine Isotopic Stages (MIS). We hypothesize that tufas related to the deep-seated Areny-Montsec confined karst aquifer were insensitive to climate variations. Landforms reminiscent of the ITMC have been detected during the last decade on Mars. Since GPR will be part of the ExoMars Rover of the European Space Agency (ESA) mission projected for 2018, we anticipate that our results may be able to constrain the interpretation of landforms possibly related to water on Mars.

The environments develop especial hydrochemical and ecological characteristics, such as high concentrations of acidity and low biodiversity, with dominance of acidophilic organisms. Ecological criteria are assuming increasing relevance for assessing water quality, including in acid mine drainage-affected systems. Photosynthetic pigments, like chlorophyll, could be considered in this context as they are generally used to estimate phytoplankton biomass. The present work was focused on acid mine drainage and their relationships with chlorophyll a. It was developed in the historic mine of Sao Domingos (Iberian Pyrite Belt, SW Europe). The methodological approach comprised two sampling campaigns (October and February) to represent seasonal behaviour. The diversity of hydrological conditions was also considered through sampling sites established in the pit lake, acidic lagoons and affected stream. Hydrochemistry and chlorophyll a were analysed. The obtained results revealed very low pH values, with a minimum of 2.1. In general, hydrochemistry indicates higher concentrations of pollutants in summer. One of the sampling point, located in an acidic lagoon, stood out by highest concentrations, presenting maximum of sulfate (6564 mg/L), As (6.26 mg/L), and metals like Al (675 mg/L), Cd (1,30 mg/L), Zn (199 mg/L). These highest concentrations coincided with the maximum concentration of chlorophyll a (113 mu g/L). The results suggested that the more contaminated the environment, more chlorophyll a was produced. Factor analyses emphasised the relationships between acid drainage properties and the photosynthetic activity, indicating a strong pH dependency of chlorophyll a production. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to their large multimodular non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) and polyketide synthases (PKS) biosynthetic machinery, cyanobacteria have represented a significant new source of structurally bioactive secondary metabolites. Moorea as a prolific producer have yielded lots of natural products with a variety of bioactivities such as highly cytotoxicity, anticancer activity, ion channel blocking activity, brine shrimp toxicity and other activities. Some of secondary metabolites have been identified as potential lead compounds for the development of anti-cancer agents. In this review, a total of 111 bioactive marine cyanobacterial secondary metabolites from the genus Moorea, published in the 54 literatures updated to the middle of 2019 and some synthetic analogues, are discussed with emphasis on their structures and biological activities.

JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Distributions of freshwater midges, including Chironomidae, Chaoboridae, and Ceratopogonidae, were analyzed along a transect of lakes extending north from Whitehorse (Yukon Territory) to the Arctic Ocean (Northwest Territories). Abiskomyia, Mesocricotopus, Monodiamesa, and Paracladius were restricted to arctic tundra lakes, whereas Chaoborus, Pseudochironomus, Polypedilium, and Glyptotendipes were clearly associated with forest and forest-tundra environments. Many other taxa were broadly distributed with little apparent regard to latitude or ecoclimatic region. Canonical correspondence analyses revealed that midge distributions were most strongly correlated with total Kjeldahl N, maximum lake depth, pH, and summer surface water temperature. The distribution patterns suggest that subfossil midges may provide valuable proxy evidence for paleoenvironmental conditions in the Beringian region of northwestern Canada and Alaska.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Pienitz, Reinhard/0000-0002-3613-1673; Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696													0887-3593					JUN	2003	22	2					323	337		10.2307/1468001	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1468001													WOS:000183594300012

Climate and land use interactively affect lake phytoplankton nutrient limitation status	ECOLOGY												Climate-change models predict more frequent and intense summer droughts for many areas, including the midwestern United States. Precipitation quantity and intensity in turn drive the rates and ratios at which nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are exported from watersheds into lakes, but these rates and ratios are also modulated by watershed land use. This led us to ask the question, is the effect of precipitation on phytoplankton nutrient limitation dependent on watershed land use? Across 42 lakes, we found that phytoplankton in lakes in agricultural landscapes were usually P limited but shifted to strong N limitation under increased drought intensity, and that droughts promoted N-fixing cyanobacteria. In contrast, phytoplankton in lakes with forested watersheds were consistently N limited, regardless of drought status. This climate-land use interaction suggests that droughts may increase the incidence of N limitation in agriculturally impacted lakes. N limitation would likely impair valuable ecosystem services such as drinking water, fisheries, and recreation by promoting the occurrence and severity of cyanobacterial blooms.

The study lakes (873) were chosen by stratified random sampling from all Finnish lakes with a surface area greater than or equal to 0.04 km(2) (29 515 lakes in all). The chemical parameters of the lake water were determined for water samples taken in autumn 1995, Information on the fish stocks of the study lakes was collected by means of a postal questionnaire sent to local fishing authorities and lake owners. The results show that the fish community structure is cyprinid dominated, reflecting eutrophication in 2100 lakes (7% of all the target lakes). Strong fouling of the fishing gear, as well as a great abundance of unwanted species in the catch of passive gears, were considered to be a continuous problem in more than 10% of the lakes. Roach, Rutilus rutilus (L.), and bream, Abramis brama (L.), were the most common species to have increased in abundance in the study lakes, whereas burbot, Lota lota (L.), and vendace, Coregonus albula (L.), decreased, especially in highly eutrophic lakes. High total phosphorus and cyprinid dominance in lakes were found mainly in the most intensive agricultural regions in the western and southern parts of Finland.																			0969-997X					JUN	1999	6	3					173	186		10.1046/j.1365-2400.1999.00152.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2400.1999.00152.x													WOS:000082699500001

Observations of rapidly rising dissolved organic carbon concentrations in rivers draining peatlands have created concerns that those stores are beginning to destabilize(2,3). Three main factors have been put forward as potential causal mechanisms, but it appears that two alternatives-warming(2,4) and increased river discharge(3)-cannot offer satisfactory explanations(5). Here we show that the third proposed mechanism, namely shifting trends in the proportion of annual rainfall arriving in summer(6), is similarly unable to account for the trend. Instead we infer that a previously unrecognized mechanism-carbon dioxide mediated stimulation of primary productivity-is responsible. Under elevated carbon dioxide levels, the proportion of dissolved organic carbon derived from recently assimilated carbon dioxide was ten times higher than that of the control cases. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon appear far more sensitive to environmental drivers that affect net primary productivity than those affecting decomposition alone.

Drainage lakes are most common (70%), followed by headwater lakes (17%). The lakes in the survey span most of the variation in humic matter concentration found in aquatic ecosystems (total organic carbon (TOC) = 0.5-47 (mg.L-1, colour = 0-600 mg Pt.L-1. The median TOC, colour, and chemical oxygen demand (COD(Mn)) are 12 mg.L-1, 100 mg Pt.L-1, and 15 Mg O2.L-1, respectively. TOC is significantly related to other water quality parameters including the following: COD(Mn) (r2 = 0.92), colour (r2 = 0.86), total iron (r2 = 0.69), total nitrogen (r2 = 0.53), and total phosphorus (r2 = 0.41). TOC and nutrient concentrations are low in northern Finland compared with southern and central regions. Multiple linear regression shows that the proportion of the catchment area covered by peatlands is the most important catchment variable determining TC)C concentrations. In northern Finland, where catchment areas are less disturbed compared with southern regions, peatlands and latitude explain 63% of the variation in TOC. In the full set of lakes, latitude, catchment to lake area ratio, and the proportion of the catchment area covered by peatlands, upstream lakes, and fields explain 55% of the variation in TOC.

EFFECTS OF ARTIFICIAL FLOODING ON WATER QUALITY OF A FLOODPLAIN BACKWATER	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Seasonal flooding of riverine backwaters is important in maintaining diverse aquatic habitats, but anthropogenic impacts have reduced the frequency and duration of such flooding. This study, conducted in a 2.5-km-long shallow floodplain severed meander backwater adjacent to the Coldwater River in Tunica County, Mississippi, USA, compared water quality during a late summer 30-day artificial flooding period with 28-day pre-flood and 26-day post-flood periods. Flooding was simulated by pumping 0.22 to 0.35?m3?s-1 from the river into the upstream portion of the backwater. In situ parameters (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and fluorescent chlorophyll) were measured every 30?min at one site within the backwater. Solids (dissolved and suspended) and nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen) were measured at three sites in the backwater and in the river every 3 to 5?days. Decreases in the amplitude of temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH diel cycles within the backwater were observed during flooding. Changes in patterns of solids and nutrients were also associated with flooding. Complex patterns in phosphorus and nitrogen emerged as a result of utilization by autotrophs (measured as chlorophyll) and seasonal changes. Artificial flooding in a shallow floodplain water body stabilized and improved water quality for aquatic biota and is a viable method for habitat rehabilitation in these systems.

A special focus is on the element ratios (Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca), and the stable isotope composition (delta(18)O, delta(13)C), in both ambient waters and ostracod calcite. The most common species are Fabaeformiscandona pedata and F. harmsworthi with the highest frequency in all studied waters. Average partition coefficients D(Sr) of F. pedata are 0.33 +/- 0.06 (1 sigma) in females, and 0.32 +/- 0.06 (1 sigma) in males. A near 1:1 relationship of delta(18)O was found, with a mean shift of Delta(mean) = 2.2% +/- 0.5 (1 sigma) to heavier values in ostracod calcite of F. pedata as compared to ambient waters. The shift is not dependent on delta(18)O(water), and is caused by metabolic (vital) and temperature effects. Temperature-dependence is reflected in the variations of this shift. For ostracod calcite of F. pedata a vital effect as compared to inorganic calcite in equilibrium was quantified with 1.4%. Results of this study are valuable for the palaeoenvironmental interpretation of geochemical data of fossil ostracods from permafrost deposits.					; Viehberg, Finn/F-4984-2010; Wetterich, Sebastian/AAD-6569-2019; Meyer, Hanno/E-2870-2016; Mackensen, Andreas/J-8600-2013; Schirrmeister, Lutz/O-5584-2015	Viehberg, Finn/0000-0003-0253-2222; Wetterich, Sebastian/0000-0001-9234-1192; Meyer, Hanno/0000-0003-4129-4706; Mackensen, Andreas/0000-0002-5024-4455; Schirrmeister, Lutz/0000-0001-9455-0596													0921-2728					MAY	2008	39	4					427	449		10.1007/s10933-007-9122-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-007-9122-1													WOS:000254905100001

Acute exposure to PS-MPs decreased the survival rate and heart rate of prawn larvae. After chronic exposure to PS-MPs (2 and 20 mg/L) for four weeks, the oxidative stress generation in tes-tis tissue indicated a negative impact on male prawn testicular function. PS-MPs disrupted testicular germ cell quality and caused sex hormone imbalance, leading to reduced hatching success and survival of F1 larvae, despite not being exposed to PS-MPs. Steroidogenic gene expression was altered and apoptosis-related genes had higher expression in the gonads after parental exposure to PS-MPs. Decreased immunity-related enzyme activities were observed in F1 lar-vae with/without continued PS-MPs exposure, compared with those in untreated prawns. A concentration-dependent increase in bioaccumulation of PS-MPs in different tissues of larval offspring was observed. Thus, PS-MPs had multiple effects on male reproductive dysfunction and transgenerational toxicity in prawns. Our findings provide a novel insight into the reproductive toxicity mechanism of microplastics in freshwater crustaceans.

Twentieth century erosion in Arctic Alaska foothills: The influence of shrubs, runoff, and permafrost	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Recent changes in the climate of Arctic Alaska, including warmer summers and a lengthened growing season, have increased vegetation productivity and permafrost temperatures. In this study, we use (1) time series imagery to examine the landscape pattern of tall shrub distribution and expansion in Arctic Alaska and (2) lake sediments from watersheds where shrub expansion is occurring to compare twentieth century temporal trends between shrub cover, erosion, and runoff. Landsat thematic mapper data from 1986 and 2009 were used to evaluate the expansion of tall shrubs across three regional subscenes in the Arctic foothills in northeast Alaska. We found that tall shrubs occupied floodplains and streams in 1986 and have been expanding their coverage along these corridors. The interaction between shrub expansion and erosion was examined by reconstructing the last 60-100 years of erosion from sediment cores in four lakes with shrub expansion in the surrounding watersheds. Three of the four lake cores show a steadily increasing or fluctuating erosion rate until 1980, after which these cores show a synchronous decline. We postulate that the increase in shrubs since 1980 in landscape positions prone to erosion has contributed to the decline in erosion. A decrease in the magnitude and frequency of runoff events has likely also contributed to the decline in erosion. Our results indicate a general decline in erosion since 1980 that is contemporaneous with shrub expansion and peak runoff decline, punctuated by episodic erosion events in one of four catchments.

Dropstones occur in wave-rippled, fine-grained sandstones and siltstones that contain desiccation and syneresis cracks indicative of fluctuating lake levels. Five locally derived dropstones occur at the same horizon over lateral distance of 250 m and display clear evidence of deflection and penetration of laminae at the base, with thinning, onlap and draping of laminae on to clast margins and tops. Mechanisms of dropstone formation are discussed, with ice-rafting considered the most likely explanation. It is suggested that rafting was promoted by cold winters at 35 degrees S in the early Neoproterozoic, possibly in an upland setting. Interpretation of the dropstones as ice-rafted debris provides the first physical record of evidence for ice at the Earth's surface during the late Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic.

However, UAVs are often limited by battery endurance and weight constraints on the scientific payload that can be added. At S & aacute;lajiegna, the largest freshwater calving glacier in Sweden, we explored the combined use of a versatile maritime robot (uncrewed surface vehicle, USV) and a UAV to characterise S & aacute;lajiegna's short-term and seasonal calving front dynamics and mass loss. For this, a photogrammetric payload suite was integrated into the USV. Consecutive USV surveys of S & aacute;lajiegna's front, followed by point cloud based calving detection and surface-reconstruction based volume quantification, allowed for a detailed description of calving-induced terminus changes and is hence suggested as a viable alternative to the differencing of digital elevation models. By combining USV and UAV measurements, we identify sectors of high and low calving activity, a calving front retreat of up to 56 m and a thinning rate in the terminus region of 5.4 cm d-1 during the summer of 2022.

Fluted and Basally Thinned Concave-Base Points of Obsidian in the Borden Collection from Inyo County, Alta California: Age and Significance	CALIFORNIA ARCHAEOLOGY												This article describes, classifies, and provides the calculated ages of 14 basally thinned and fluted points of obsidian in the Borden collection from Rose Valley in southern Inyo County, California. With the exception of one item of Fish Springs obsidian, the specimens are all made of glass from geologic subsources in the Coso Volcanic Field. Typologically, the fragmentary and reworked artifacts appear to represent Clovis, or perhaps Clovis-derived, concave-base lanceolate points. Obsidian hydration measurements permit age calculations that range between approximately 13,793 and 11,308 calendar years ago. The calculated ages of the Borden artifacts are consistent with their discovery on landforms associated with Younger Dryas and very early Holocene wetlands. Our research results also suggest that Clovis technology may have persisted longer in California than it did in the southeastern, central, and southwestern United States.					; Erlandson, Jon/ITV-0032-2023	Erlandson, Jon/0000-0002-4705-4319; 													1947-461X	1947-4628					2018	10	1					27	60		10.1080/1947461X.2017.1391476	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1947461X.2017.1391476													WOS:000432534700002

The seasonal succession of cladoceran species was characterized and the impact of extreme climatic events on the annual pattern of species succession was assessed. Using a multivariate method, we show that the cladoceran species display marked seasonality patterns that differed in the two lakes. The differences observed between the lakes were driven by their trophic state, the plankton species composition and the abundance of predators. We show that the sensitivity of the annual pattern of species succession to extreme weather changes, illustrated by the 2003 heat wave, differs markedly in these two lakes. In Lake Annecy, the annual pattern of cladoceran succession observed in 2003 is not different from the one usually observed. In contrast, in Lake Geneva, the annual pattern recorded in 2003 is unusual and characterized by the maintenance of herbivorous cladocera during summer. These findings underline the need to consider the morphology of lakes and trophic state in the assessment of ecological responses to global warming. Our results contribute to the debate about the predictability of the impacts of climate change on aquatic ecosystems, and their extrapolation from one site to another.

A 277 year cool season dam inflow reconstruction for Tasmania, southeastern Australia	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Seasonal variability is a significant source of uncertainty in projected changes to precipitation across southeastern Australia (SEA). While existing instrumental records provide seasonal data for recent decades, most proxy records (e.g., tree rings, corals, speleothems) offer only annual reconstructions of hydroclimate. We present the first cool-season (July-August) reconstruction of dam inflow (Lake Burbury) for western Tasmania in SEA based on tree-ring width (Athrotaxis selaginoides) and mean latewood cell wall thickness (Phyllocladus aspleniifolius) chronologies. The reconstruction, produced using principal component regression, verifies back to 1731 and is moderately skillful, explaining around 23% of the variance. According to the reconstruction, relatively low inflow periods occurred around 1860, the early 1900s and 1970, while relatively high inflows occurred in the 1770s and 1810s. Highest reconstructed inflows occurred in 1816, and lowest in 1909. Comparison with available documentary and instrumental records indicates that the reconstruction better captures high rather than low flow events. There is virtually no correlation between our reconstruction and another for December-January inflow for the same catchment, a result consistent with the relationship between seasonal instrumental data. This suggests that conditions in one season have not generally reflected conditions in the other season over the instrumental record, or for the past 277 years. This illustrates the value of obtaining reconstructions of regional hydroclimatic variability for multiple individual seasons in regions where dry and wet seasons are not strongly defined. The results also indicate that the hydroclimate of the southeastern Australian region cannot be adequately represented by a single regional reconstruction.

Simulation of surface temperature and ice cover of large northern lakes with 1-D models: a comparison with MODIS satellite data and in situ measurements	TELLUS SERIES A-DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Lake surface temperature (LST) and ice phenology were simulated for various points differing in depth on Great Slave Lake and Great Bear Lake, two large lakes located in the Mackenzie River Basin in Canada's Northwest Territories, using the 1-D Freshwater Lake model (FLake) and the Canadian Lake Ice Model (CLIMo) over the 2002-2010 period, forced with data from three weather stations (Yellowknife, Hay River and Deline). LST model results were compared to those derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Earth Observing System Terra and Aqua satellite platforms. Simulated ice thickness and freeze-up/break-up dates were also compared to in situ observations. Both models showed a good agreement with daily average MODIS LSTs on an annual basis (0.935 <= relative index of agreement <= 0.984 and 0.94 <= mean bias error <= 4.83). The absence of consideration of snow on lake ice in FLake was found to have a large impact on estimated ice thicknesses (25 cm thicker on average by the end of winter compared to in situ measurements; 9 cm thicker for CLIMo) and break-up dates (6 d earlier in comparison with in situ measurements; 3 d later for CLIMo). The overall agreement between the two models and MODIS LST products during both the open water and ice seasons was good. Remotely sensed data are a promising data source for assimilation into numerical weather prediction models, as they provide the spatial coverage that is not captured by in situ data.

The studied lakes. Moreno, El Trebol, Nahuel Huapi, Gutierrez, and Morenito, located in the Patagonia region (41 degreesS, 71 degreesW, 800 m of altitude), had attenuation coefficients for UV-B that ranged from 0.36 m(-1) (Lake Moreno) to 2.8 m(-1) (Lake Morenito). The samples were inoculated with labeled carbon (NaH(14)CO3) and incubated in an illuminated chamber (UV-B = 0.35 W M-2, UV-A [320-400 nm] = 1.1 W m(-2), and PAR [400-700 nm] = 10.8 W m(-2)) at 10 degreesC. The phytoplankton cells were exposed to UV radiation (280-400 nm) + PAR (quartz tubes), and to UV-A + PAR (quartz tubes covered with Mylar-D). The total duration of the experiments was 4 h and two samples were taken from each treatment every hour. In lakes Moreno, El Trebol, Nahuel Huapi and Gutierrez, the photosynthetic inhibition increased linearly with UV-B doses, while in Lake Morenito just a slight relationship was observed. After receiving a dose of 1.25 kJ m(-2) (UV-B), phytoplankton from Lake Morenito had the highest cumulative photosynthetic inhibition (44 %), whereas in Lakes Moreno, El Trebol, Nahuel Huapi and Gutierrez the inhibition was of 22, 11, 5, and 1 %, respectively. However, at the end of incubation period and after receiving doses of 5 kJ m(-2), the most inhibited phytoplankton cells were from Lake Moreno (70 %) and the most resistant (27 %) was that from Lake Gutierrez. The kinetics of inhibition was different in each lake, and transparent lakes, with higher proportion of large cells, had higher inhibition rates. The results suggest that an increase in UV-B radiation (e.g., produced by a decrease in stratospheric ozone) would have a greater impact on microplankton from clear lakes, while pico- and nanoplankton from less transparent lakes will be less affected.																			0716-078X					JUN	2001	74	2					273	282																WOS:000170178000005

Hydrothermal carbonate chimneys from a continental rift (Afar Rift): Mineralogy, geochemistry, and mode of formation	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Carbonate chimney-like deposits up to 60 m high are scattered or arranged in rows at the shores of a desiccating hypersaline and alkaline lake from a continental rift setting (Lake Abhe, Afar Rift, Djibouti). The chimneys formed sub-aqueously in the lake water body at a higher water level than observed today. Alternating calcite and low-Mg calcite + silica concentric layers compose the chimney structures. Mineralogical and geochemical investigations of the chimneys, lake water, and hot spring (hydrothermal) fluids suggest that the chimneys are a result of rapid carbonate precipitation during the mixing of hydrothermal fluids with lake water. In contrast to the hot spring fluid, lake water is enriched in HREE and possesses a pronounced positive Ce anomaly, features that are preserved in the carbonate chimney layers. Mixing calculations based on Sr-isotope and concentration data indicate a hydrothermal fluid contribution of similar to 45% in the chimney interior, which decreases to similar to 4% in the external chimney layer. Sr in the hydrothermal fluids is predominantly leached from the underlying volcanic rocks, whereas the lake's Sr budget is dominated by riverine input. Considering the fluid mixing ratios calculated by Sr-data, the measured C and O isotope compositions indicate that chimney carbonates precipitated at temperatures between 14 degrees C (internal part) and 22 degrees C (external part) with delta C-13-carbonate mainly controlled by isotope equilibrium exchange of lake water with atmospheric CO2. The low-Mg calcite layers, including the outermost layer, have enhanced signals of lake water inheritance based on elevated concentrations of immobile elements, Sigma REE, and Sr and Ca isotope compositions. Ca-isotope data reveal that internal chimney layers formed by non-equilibrium calcite precipitation with a predominantly hydrothermal Ca source. The external low-Mg calcite layer received Ca contributions from both hydrothermal fluid and lake water, with the latter being the dominant Ca source. Highly positive delta(44)/Ca-40 of lake water likely reflects non-equilibrium Ca-carbonate precipitation during lake water evaporation with resulting Ca-44 enrichment of residual lake water. The strong degree of Ca-44 enrichment may point towards multiple lake drying and Ca-reservoir depletion events. Coupled C-O-Ca-isotope data of the sampled carbonate chimney suggest late-stage (low-temperature) hydrothermal carbonate chimney formation during strongly evaporative lake conditions at the time of low-Mg calcite precipitation. U-Th age dating suggests that the chimneys formed no earlier than 0.82 kyr BP (0.28 +/- 0.54). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

High-quality seed dispersal by fruit-eating fishes in Amazonian floodplain habitats	OECOLOGIA												Seed dispersal is a critical stage in the life history of plants. It determines the initial pattern of juvenile distribution, and can influence community dynamics and the evolutionary trajectories of individual species. Vertebrate frugivores are the primary vector of seed dispersal in tropical forests; however, most studies of seed dispersal focus on birds, bats and monkeys. Nevertheless, South America harbors at least 200 species of frugivorous fishes, which move into temporarily flooded habitats during lengthy flood seasons and consume fruits that fall into the water; and yet, we know remarkably little about the quality of seed dispersal they effect. We investigated the seed dispersal activities of two species of large-bodied, commercially important fishes (Colossoma macropomum and Piaractus brachypomus, Characidae) over 3 years in Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve (Peru). We assessed the diet of these fishes during the flood season, conducted germination trials with seeds collected from digestive tracts, and quantified fruit availability. In the laboratory, we fed fruits to captive Colossoma, quantified the proportion of seeds defecated by adult and juvenile fish, and used these seeds in additional germination experiments. Our results indicate that Colossoma and Piaractus disperse large quantities of seeds from up to 35% of the trees and lianas that fruit during the flood season. Additionally, these seeds can germinate after floodwaters recede. Overexploitation has reduced the abundance of our focal fish species, as well as changed the age structure of populations. Moreover, older fish are more effective seed dispersers than smaller, juvenile fish. Overfishing, therefore, likely selects for the poorest seed dispersers, thus disrupting an ancient interaction between seeds and their dispersal agents.

J	RICE, JA; COCHRAN, PA				RICE, JA; COCHRAN, PA			INDEPENDENT EVALUATION OF A BIOENERGETICS MODEL FOR LARGEMOUTH BASS	ECOLOGY												A bioenergetics model for largemouth bass, M. salmoides, was evaluated using idependent field data on temperature, feeding and growth of bass in Lake Rebecca, Minnesota [USA]. Model predictions of body mass based on observed temperature and daily ration estimates fell within 2 SE of observed mean body masses on 7 of 9 sampling dates over a 4-mo. period. Three statistical methods were used to evaluate the fit between predicted and observed growth. A lack-of-fit test detected no significant lack of fit between simulated and observed body masses; partitioning mean squared error showed that 76% of the variance was due to random variation rather than to systematic errors, and a reliability index indicated agreement between predicted and observed masses within a factor of 1.12. Growth simulations were relatively robust with respect to simulated errors in the input variables temperature and swimming speed, but were sensitive to errors in initial body mass. The model used observed growth to predict cumulative food consumption over the sampling season; the prediction was within 8.5% of an extrapolation from field data. Estimation of consumption rate as a constant proportion of maximum ration for the whole season was inappropriate; however, 3 intervals that used different constant proportions of maximum ration fit the data and corresponded to observed changes in bass diet.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1984	65	3					732	739		10.2307/1938045	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1938045													WOS:A1984ST68100006
J	Harris, SA				Harris, Stuart A.			The relationship of sea level changes to climatic change in northeast Asia and northern North America during the last 75 ka B.P.	AIMS ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												The Arctic air mass is the cold, dry body of air slowly moving eastwards around the North Pole in the northern hemisphere. Its southern boundary consists of four planetary waves known as the Rossby waves that mark the interface with subtropical air bringing heat polewards. The Arctic air mass is constantly being modified by the addition of heat and moisture over the oceans, as well as by winter cooling over the land masses due to limited incoming solar radiation and constant reradiation of heat into the atmosphere. The coldest air in winter is located over northeastern Siberia and moves east, cooling Canada. Warm ocean currents add large quantities of heat to the air mass moving over them, but without this addition of heat, the Arctic air mass becomes significantly colder. Research in Tibet and Northeast Asia on depression of sea level shows that during the Late Wisconsin cold event (65-10 ka B.P.), vast quantities of sea water were sequestered on land primarily as ice sheets, exposing the sea bed in the Bering Strait from 50-10 ka B.P. together with the bottom of the South China Sea between 30-20 ka B.P.. The East China Monsoon failed to reach Tibet and much of Northeast China, resulting in severe cooling of northeast Siberia and northern Tibet. This, in turn, caused severe cooling in eastern Canada together with the development of a vast, predominantly cold-based ice sheet. As the sea levels started to rise (about 19 ka B.P.), the East China Monsoon slowly redeveloped and a gradual warming took place on both continents. However, along the west side of the North American Cordillera, the Late Wisconsin glaciation only began in 29 ka B.P. but continued along the west coast until about 10 ka B.P. This paper explores the relationship of the Late Wisconsin history on the two continents, together with the mechanisms causing the landforms and climatic differences. Finally, the probable effects of these climatic changes on the early peopling of North America are discussed.

Both lakes had conspicuous deep chlorophyll maxima near the bottom of the oxygenatedzone. DCMU sensitivity experiments revealed that photosynthesis below the chlorophyll maximum in Lake Fryxell was partially due to phtosynthetic bacteria. These bacteria had notably higher protein and lower lipid labeling than overlying oxic microalgae. Protein labeling in the oxic microalgae had lower Ik and higher .alpha. values than for other photosynthetic end products, indicating that protein is synthesized more efficiently at low photosynthetic photon flux density than the other metabolites.

A new species of Gordius (Phylum Nematomorpha) from terrestrial habitats in North America	ZOOKEYS												Freshwater hairworms (class Gordiida) are members of the phylum Nematomorpha that use terrestrial arthropods as definitive hosts but reside as free-living adult worms in rivers, lakes, or streams. The genus Gordius consists of 90 described species, of which three species were described from freshwater habitats in North America. In this paper we describe a new species of Gordius from terrestrial habitats in Oklahoma, Texas, and Louisiana, United States. Oddly, each year hundreds of adult free-living worms appear after bouts of heavy rain on streets, sidewalks, and lawns during the winter season, when terrestrial arthropod hosts are not active. The new species is described based on morphological characters of adults and non-adult stages including the egg strings, eggs, larvae, and cysts. Adult males have a unique row of bristles on the ventral inner side of each tail lobe and a circular pattern of bristles on the terminal end of each lobe, which distinguishes them from all other described North American species of Gordius. The egg string, larval, and cyst morphology of this new species conform to previous descriptions of non-adult hairworm stages for the genus Gordius. However, the eggs of this new species of hairworm are unique, as they contain an outer shell separated by distinct space from a thick inner membrane. The consistent occurrence of this gordiid in terrestrial habitats, along with its distinct egg morphology, suggests that this new species of hairworm has a terrestrial life cycle.

J	Yoshimura, M; Yokoduka, T				Yoshimura, Mayumi; Yokoduka, Tetsuya			Radioactive contamination of fishes in lake and streams impacted by the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident in March 2011 emitted radioactive substances into the environment, contaminating a wide array of organisms including fishes. We found higher concentrations of radioactive cesium (Cs-137) in brown trout (Salmo trutta) than in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus nerka), and 137Cs concentrations in brown trout were higher in a lake than in a stream. Our analyses indicated that these differences were primarily due to differences in diet, but that habitat also had an effect. Radiocesium concentrations (Cs-137) in stream charr (Salvelinus leucomaenis) were higher in regions with more concentrated aerial activity and in older fish. These results were also attributed to dietary and habitat differences. Preserving uncontaminated areas by remediating soils and releasing uncontaminated fish would help restore this popular fishing area but would require a significant effort, followed by a waiting period to allow activity concentrations to fall below the threshold limits for consumption.

These lakes have been studied insufficiently. Their genesis and mechanisms of change with the surrounding landscapes are not well understood, and still disputed. During field studies in the area of the White Lakes original data were obtained on the morphology of the lakes, the chemical composition of lake water and bottom sediments, the diversity of the animal population of the lakes, as well as on the chemical composition of bogs water and soil on lake shores. The studies were conducted in late May 2009. The results characterize the spring and early summer aspect of the condition and functioning of the wetland landscapes of the watershed of the Vasyugan Mire system. The Landscape Area of White Lakes is a unique wetlands system located at the very top of the Ob-Irtysh watershed plateau. Aerial processes, as well as surface and subsurface runoff from the drainage space, influence the formation of the chemical composition of lake water. The composition and quality of water in the lakes depend on both the landscape-geochemical characteristics of drainage basins that represent different types of wetlands, and the area of their waters. The water area of the largest lake (the Big White) is 1.96 square km, the maximal depth is 5.73 m. Most part of the shoreline of the Big White and the north shore of the Medium White border open mire complexes. Local watershed between the lakes is a northern section of pine-cottongrass-sphagnum and pine-shrub-sphagnum raised bog of 3.5 x 2.5 km. Within this bog massif Small White Lake is located. The analysis of the current status of the study area is carried out in comparison with the data of the published sources. The list of sources used contains 18 items. The analysis of the previously published and original data showed some features of the formation of the chemical composition of lake waters and distribution of elements and their compounds in the environment near the White Lakes. The paper provides interesting data on zoobenthos productivity, which is abnormally high for Vasyugan lakes. The White Lakes are located on the territory of the Vasyugan Reserve that RF government plans to establish. The landscape system of the White Lakes Area is developing under the conditions of high geochemical autonomy and represents exceptional value for background monitoring of the environment on a regular and sustained basis.

These describe the zooplankton of Lake Constance in its oligotrophic (1920-1924), mesotrophic (1952-1962), and finally meso/eutrophic (1979-1995) state. Biomass increased approximately 30-fold from the 1920s to the 1950/60s and 6-fold from the 1950/60s to the 1980/90s. The former increase was evident throughout the season, the latter was restricted to the second half of the year. Daphnid biomass has not yet shown any response to the re-oligotrophication process of Lake Constance during the 1980/90s. Within the period 1979-1995, biomass in May was significantly correlated with the North Atlantic oscillation, whereas the annual average showed no response. The magnitude of inter-annual variation in spring biomass due to climate variability was as large as the long-term response to eutrophication. Because of the key role of daphnids in freshwater ecosystems, even a temporally restricted response to climate forcing might have important consequences for the ecosystem.

Rapid disappearance of perennial ice on Canada's most northern lake	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Field records, aerial photographs, and satellite imagery show that the perennial ice cover on Ward Hunt Lake at Canada's northern coast experienced rapid contraction and thinning after at least 50years of relative stability. On all dates of sampling from 1953 to 2007, 3.5 to 4.3m of perennial ice covered 65-85% of the lake surface in summer. The ice cover thinned from 2008 onward, and the lake became ice free in 2011, an event followed by 26days of open water conditions in 2012. This rapid ice loss corresponded to a significant increase in melting degree days (MDD), from a mean (SD) of 80.4 (36.5) MDD (1996-2007) to 136.2 (16.4) MDD (2008-2012). The shallow bathymetry combined with heat advection by warm inflows caused feedback effects that accelerated the ice decay. These observations show how changes across a critical threshold can result in the rapid disappearance of thick perennial ice.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019; Fortier, Daniel/E-6965-2016	Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; Mueller, Derek/0000-0003-1974-319X; Fortier, Daniel/0000-0003-0908-6157													0094-8276	1944-8007				MAR 16	2015	42	5					1433	1440		10.1002/2014GL062960	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014GL062960													WOS:000351847600022

The latest explosive eruptions of Ciomadul (Csomad) volcano, East Carpathians - A tephrostratigraphic approach for the 51-29 ka BP time interval	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The most recent, mainly explosive eruptions of Ciomadul, the youngest volcano in the Carpatho-Pannonian Region, have been constrained by detailed field volcanological studies, major element pumice glass geochemistry, luminescence and radiocarbon dating, and a critical evaluation of available geochronological data. These investigations were complemented by the first tephrostratigraphic studies of the lacustrine infill of Ciomadul's twin craters (St. Ana and Mohos) that received tephra deposition during the last eruptions of the volcano. Our analysis shows that significant explosive activity, collectively called EPPA (Early Phreatomagmatic and Plinian Activity), started at Ciomadul in or around the present-day Mohos, the older crater, at >= 51 ka BP. These eruptions resulted in a thick succession of pyroclastic-fall deposits found in both proximal and medial/distal localities around the volcano, characterized by highly silicic (rhyolitic) glass chemical compositions (ca. 75.2-79.8 wt.% SiO2). The EPPA stage was terminated by a subplinian/plinian eruption at ka BP, producing pumiceous pyroclasticfall and-flow deposits of similar glass composition, probably from a "Proto-St. Ana" vent located at or around the younger crater hosting the present-day Lake St. Ana. After a quiescent period with a proposed lava dome growth in the St Ana crater, a new explosive stage began, defined as MPA (Middle Plinian Activity). In particular, a significant two-phase eruption occurred at similar to 31.5 ka BP, producing pyroclastic flows from vulcanian explosions disrupting the preexisting lava dome of SE Ana, and followed by pumiceous fallout from a plinian eruption column. Related pyroclastic deposits show a characteristic, less evolved rhyolitic glass composition (ca. 70.2-74.5 wt% SiO2) and occur both in proximal and medial/distal localities up to 21 km from source. The MPA eruptions, that may have pre-shaped a crater similar to, but possibly smaller than, the present-day St Ana crater, was followed by a so far unknown, but likewise violent last eruptive stage from the same vent, creating the final morphology of the crater. This stage, referred to as LSPA (Latest St Ana Phreatomagmatic Activity), produced pyroclastic-fall deposits of more evolved rhyolitic glass composition (ca. 72.8-78.8 wt% SiO2) compared to that of the previous MPA stage. According to radiocarbon age constraints on bulk sediment, charcoal and organic matter from lacustrine sediments recovered from both craters, the last of these phreatomagmatic eruptions that draped the landscape toward the east and southeast of the volcano - occurred at similar to 29.6 ka BP, some 2000 years later than the previously suggested last eruption of Ciomadul.

However, knowledge of diurnal N2O emission patterns from different habitats remains limited. To understand the diurnal patterns and driving mechanisms of N2O emissions from contrasting habitats, continuous in situ observations (72 h) of N2O fluxes from an algae-dominated zone (ADZ) and reed-dominated zone (RDZ) in Lake Taihu were conducted using the Floating Chamber method. The results showed average N2O emission fluxes of 0.15 +/- 0.06 and 0.02 +/- 0.04 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) in the ADZ and RDZ in autumn, respectively. The significantly higher (p < 0.05) N2O fluxes in the ADZ were mainly attributed to differences in nitrogen (N) levels. The results also showed significant diurnal differences (p < 0.05) in the N2O emission fluxes within the ADZ and RDZ, and daytime fluxes were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than nighttime fluxes. The statistical results indicated that N2O emissions from the ADZ were mainly driven by diurnal variations in N loading and the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, and those from the RDZ were more influenced by DO, redox potential, and pH. Finally, we determined the proper time for routine monitoring of N2O flux in the two habitats. Our results highlight the importance of considering diverse habitats and diurnal variations when estimating N2O budgets at a whole-lake scale.

Recent developments in ground-penetrating radar technology have greatly increased its portability and capabilities for imaging through fresh water. The suitability of a backpack portable ground-penetrating radar (GPR) system for bathymetric mapping of ice-covered Arctic lakes was investigated by performing grid surveys on three lakes with water depths up to 19 m. It was demonstrated that GPR can now be used to quickly produce high quality bathymetric maps and sub-bottom profiles showing sediment type and lacustrine sediment thickness.

J	O'Leary, DS; Kellermann, JL; Wayne, C				O'Leary, Donal S., III; Kellermann, Jherime L.; Wayne, Chris			Snowmelt timing, phenology, and growing season length in conifer forests of Crater Lake National Park, USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY												Anthropogenic climate change is having significant impacts on montane and high-elevation areas globally. Warmer winter temperatures are driving reduced snowpack in the western USA with broad potential impacts on ecosystem dynamics of particular concern for protected areas. Vegetation phenology is a sensitive indicator of ecological response to climate change and is associated with snowmelt timing. Human monitoring of climate impacts can be resource prohibitive for land management agencies, whereas remotely sensed phenology observations are freely available at a range of spatiotemporal scales. Little work has been done in regions dominated by evergreen conifer cover, which represents many mountain regions at temperate latitudes. We used moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to assess the influence of snowmelt timing and elevation on five phenology metrics (green up, maximum greenness, senescence, dormancy, and growing season length) within Crater Lake National Park, Oregon, USA from 2001 to 2012. Earlier annual mean snowmelt timing was significantly correlated with earlier onset of green up at the landscape scale. Snowmelt timing and elevation have significant explanatory power for phenology, though with high variability. Elevation has a moderate control on early season indicators such as snowmelt timing and green up and less on late-season variables such as senescence and growing season length. PCA results show that early season indicators and late season indicators vary independently. These results have important implications for ecosystem dynamics, management, and conservation, particularly of species such as whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) in alpine and subalpine areas.

Satellite observations indicate rapid warming trend for lakes in California and Nevada	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Large lake temperatures are excellent indicators of climate change; however, their usefulness is limited by the paucity of in situ measurements and lack of long-term data records. Thermal infrared satellite imagery has the potential to provide frequent and accurate retrievals of lake surface temperatures spanning several decades on a global scale. Analysis of seventeen years of data from the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer series of sensors and data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer shows that six lakes situated in California and Nevada have exhibited average summer nighttime warming trends of 0.11 +/- 0.02 degrees C yr(-1) (p < 0.002) since 1992. A comparison with air temperature observations suggests that the lake surface temperature is warming approximately twice as fast as the average minimum surface air temperature.

Some of the wild taxa may have been collected, but many are probably here by chance. Three criteria are used as evidence for human transport and manipulation of wild plant remains: number of items, fragmentation, and carbonization. Relations between these criteria and known ethnobotanical properties of the identified plants are statistically analyzed. Results display good evidence of the gathering of edible wild fruits and seeds. Other gathering practices are not documented. Edible fruits and seeds seem to have been gathered mainly front ruderal spring weed communities and, possibly,from forest clearances and hedge communities. Fragmentaton appears to be less of a discriminating factor than number of plant remains and carbonization.

J	WELCH, EB; SCHRIEVE, GD				WELCH, EB; SCHRIEVE, GD			ALUM TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND LONGEVITY IN SHALLOW LAKES	HYDROBIOLOGIA												An evaluation of six shallow Washington State (USA) lakes, treated with alum in the 1980s, has shown that treatment effectiveness ranged from 50 to 80% and lasted for at least five years. Such effectiveness/longevity makes alum a highly cost-effective, in-lake treatment for shallow lakes. However, alum may be completely ineffective, or effectiveness may be short-lived, if much of the lake is covered with macrophytes that senesce during summer and contribute phosphorus (P) to the water. The sharp reduction in blue-green algae following alum treatments suggests that inhibition of the sediment-to-water migration rate of blue-greens may be an important mechanism for alum's effect in oxic shallow lakes. That is in contrast to the primary mechanism in stratified anoxic lakes, which involves the complexation of P in the alum floc layer under reducing conditions.																			0018-8158					FEB 25	1994	275						423	431		10.1007/BF00026731	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026731													WOS:A1994NB19800038

Ten species were present, and the numerically dominant species were Cnephia lapponica, Simulium rostratum/truncatum, and S. ornatum. Densities were very high reaching maximally >120 cm-2 in C. lapponica, and > 140 cm-2 in mixed aggregations. Along with the description of the simuliid community that of their predators was investigated. The larvae of eleven insect species of four orders were found predating on simuliid larvae. The predators with the highest average simuliid consumption were the trichopterans Halesus sp.and Hydropsyche siltalai, and the perlodid plecopterans Isoperla grammatica, and Diura nanseni. Due to differences between predator and prey phenologies, predators were variously important to different prey species. Thus, Diura nanseni primarily ingested S. ornatum, whereas Halesus sp. preyed heavily on larvae and pupae of Cnephia lapponica and Simulium rostratum/truncatum. Since Hydropsyche siltalai and Isoperla grammatica were common and present nearly at all times they had the greatest influence and affected all blackfly species. Presented data suggest that the impact from predators is greatest in the summer (July-August), after the main peak of blackfly larvae and pupae.																			0003-455X						1994	31	2					245	255																WOS:A1994PD03200004

In recent decades, rapid social and economic development has led to increased land use/land cover (LULC) changes in the Dongting Lake area, which affect the surface energy balance and hydrological processes. Its contemporary variability under climate change remains highly uncertain. Therefore, we retrieved the Land surface temperature (LST) from the Landsat 7 data and explored its relationship with the LULC types. The results showed that LST is significantly affected by surface type. LST varied significantly across LULC types, with higher LSTs in built-up land, reed beach land, forest land, and paddy fields than in water bodies, mud beaches, marshlands, and riparian forests. Water bodies play an important regulatory role in reducing LST and mitigating thermal effects on the ground. The winter LST in the study area increased by approximately 3.5 degrees C, which may be related to the decrease in the area of Dongting Lake water bodies, water fields and reed flats after the Three Gorges Reservoir was impounded. Compared with the relationship between the NDVI, DEM, and distance from the water body, the negative correlation between the NDMI and LST was stronger and more stable and had the greatest effect on LST. These insights improve the understanding of the land change consequences on the temporal dynamics of LST.

N.; Tedesco, Pablo; Garcia-Berthou, Emili			Artificial macrophytes as fish habitat in a Mediterranean reservoir subjected to seasonal water level disturbances	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Artificial macrophytes were experimentally deployed in Boadella Reservoir (NE Spain) and assessed for fish use throughout the first 3 months of the 2007 summer drawdown. In total, 1,832 individuals of seven fish species were recorded through visual censuses, with introduced perch Perca fluviatilis being the prevalent species. Fish richness and abundance were significantly higher in artificial macrophytes than in rocky shores and sandy beaches, displaying a unimodal variation through time. P. fluviatilis, Rutilus rutilus and Abramis brama were significantly more abundant in artificial macrophytes than in the other two naturally submersed habitats, where no individuals of these species were recorded. The abundances of Squalius laietanus, Lepomis gibbosus, Micropterus salmoides and Cyprinus carpio were overall greater in artificial macrophytes than in rocky shores but displayed significant habitat x time interactions. A decrease in predation risk was apparently the key-factor of the intensive use of artificial macrophytes by small fish (a parts per thousand currency sign100 mm TL) in Boadella Reservoir, since most species reduced drastically or completely the use of submerged structures when body size increased. This study demonstrates that adding artificial structures mimicking aquatic macrophytes can be an interesting tool to mitigate the adverse effects of water level fluctuations on fish assemblages in structure-less and homogeneous ecosystems, and to understand the mechanisms affecting habitat use and species replacement.

J	WARBURTON, JA; STONE, RH; MARLER, BL				WARBURTON, JA; STONE, RH; MARLER, BL			HOW THE TRANSPORT AND DISPERSION OF AGI AEROSOLS MAY AFFECT DETECTABILITY OF SEEDING EFFECTS BY STATISTICAL-METHODS	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY												Trace chemical measurements of the silver content of snow have been used to investigate the transport and dispersion of silver iodide cloud seeding aerosols into and around two large target areas in the central Sierra Nevada between 1978 and 1992. The background concentration of silver in snow samples in this region is extremely low [B-Ag = 2.0 parts per trillion (ppt); standard deviation, sigma = 1.0 ppt], and the silver from the seeding activities is readily detectable. The studies, in winter snowstorm conditions, show that targeting of the seeding aerosols was modest to poor with large variability both spatially and temporally. Analysis of several thousand snow samples over a period of several years has demonstrated that only 20% (average) of the precipitation that fell within the intended target area during seeding activities contained silver from the silver iodide seeding aerosol above the assigned ''threshold'' concentration of B-Ag + 2(sigma) = 4.0 ppt. Targeting of one of the catchment areas under southerly flow storm conditions was particularly poor ( less than 8% of the sampled snow containing detectable silver above the ''threshold'' value). Evidence is also presented of the transport of silver iodide in directions and into areas other than those intended including upwind control areas used for estimating seeding effects in the target. In one period of the study between 1987 and 1990, emphasis was placed on southerly flow storms. It was found that contamination of two control areas in the Lake Almanor region generally occurred in the early phases of these southerly flow storm periods when winds at the lower levels were from northeast to southeast prior to frontal passage. The method used for estimating the layer-averaged wind prior to storm classification for seeding purposes in this project placed equal emphasis on winds at all levels from 2000 m, the approximate elevation of the ground generators, to the similar to 10 degrees C level. Hence, aerosols released at ground level were often transported inadvertently toward the control areas by these low-level winds. The problems that these results raise in regard to the traditional use of precipitation statistics for assessing seeding effects are discussed. The results of the studies indicate that it would be necessary to produce very substantial precipitation changes in the limited areas where the seeding silver is present in the snowfall to yield a statistically acceptable change over an entire target area. The trace chemistry results presented may explain why one of the randomized cloud seeding experiments did not achieve statistically significant seeding effects and why another statistically significant result may have been misinterpreted. New seeding program designs and assessment methodologies need to be developed that not only will produce better targeting, but also positively identify the precipitation that has been impacted by the seeding process, so that seeding effects may be quantified with a higher degree of confidence.																			0894-8763					SEP	1995	34	9					1929	1941		10.1175/1520-0450(1995)034<1929:HTTADO>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(1995)034<1929:HTTADO>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1995RQ59100003

These expeditions include measurements of fluorescent characteristics at different water levels from the surface down to the bottom. Direct methods for determination of biomass and chlorophyll concentration in algae are quite laborious and do not allow in situ analysis of the results. Fluorescent methods, which are fast enough, are generally indirect and should be specially justified to provide the quantitative information about biomass or chlorophyll concentration. In this study, the results of synchronous measurements are used to examine the feasibility of empirical calibration and quantitative reconstruction of the chlorophyll content from measured fluorescent characteristics.

Berry			Hypersaline "wet patches" in Taylor Valley, Antarctica	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Spatially isolated patches of soil located in Taylor Valley, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, are sites of elevated salt content and soil moisture. During Antarctic spring, in the absence of snow melt, visibly wet (reduced albedo) patches of soil are present at the surface. The soil pore fluids are hypersaline and have average water activity of 0.74 (the water activity of a solution determines the equilibrium vapor pressure of that solution), and are an order of magnitude more saline than average soils in the Dry Valleys. These salty soils are 3-5 times more water rich than average soils. Geochemical and meteorological analyses show that these wet patches are sites of direct vapor emplacement into soil pore fluids that may ultimately be sourced by the deliquescence of soil salts. These wet patches represent a non-precipitation, non-groundwater source for water into Antarctic permafrost. Citation: Levy, J. S., A. G. Fountain, K. A. Welch, and W. B.

Since the current monthly to sub -seasonal drought -flood abrupt alternation index (DFAI) has the limitations of misjudgments, omissions and neglecting alternation speed, this study proposes a novel multiscale standardized DFAI index (MSDFAI) based on the definition of the misjudgment and omission rates as well as alternation speed. A comparative test and spatial - temporal characterization analysis in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) are conducted. The results show that the misjudgment rate of DFAI in the YRB varies between 3 % - 181 %, and its omission rate varies between 0.5 % - 45 %, which is unable to find a suitable point that will satisfy both misjudgment and omission at the same time. The alternation speed has a significant impact on the level of DFAA events, and there are 30 underestimations of DFAA events in the YRB during 1962 - 2022 when only considering the alternation intensity. The MSDFAI index makes a conditional judgment on whether a drought or flood event occurs based on the standardized precipitation index (SPI) value, which can effectively avoid these misjudgments and omissions. Meanwhile, the MSDFAI index describes the DFAA events in a more comprehensive manner by introducing the speed factor. The DFAA has a spatial pattern with relatively low frequency in the Poyang Lake basin and the middle YRB, and high frequency in the upper YRB, the Han River, and the lower YRB. The inter decadal variability of DFAA events in the YRB is characterized by a turning point in the 1990 s, when DFAA events are increased after the 1990 s. The proposed MSDFAI index can monitor DFAA events much comprehensively and effectively in the YRB, and provide technique support for identification and prevention of DFAA in the changing environment.

It is assumed that almost 50% of the discharge of Tarim River are provided by glaciers. For this reason, climatic changes, and thus changes in glacier mass balance and glacier discharge are of high impact for the whole region. In this study, a conceptual hydrological model able to incorporate discharge from debris-covered glacier areas is presented. To simulate glacier melt and subsequent runoff in the past (1970/1971-1999/2000) and future (2070/2071-2099/2100), meteorological input data were generated based on ECHAM5/MPI-OM1 global climate model projections. The hydrological model HBV-LMU was calibrated by an automatic calibration algorithm using runoff and snow cover information as objective functions. Manual fine-tuning was performed to avoid unrealistic results for glacier mass balance. The simulations show that annual runoff sums will increase significantly under future climate conditions. A sensitivity analysis revealed that total runoff does not decrease until the glacier area is reduced by 43%. Ice melt is the major runoff source in the recent past, and its contribution will even increase in the coming decades. Seasonal changes reveal a trend towards enhanced melt in spring, but a change from a glacial-nival to a nival-pluvial runoff regime will not be reached until the end of this century.

J	Caroni, R; Piscia, R; Manca, M				Caroni, Rossana; Piscia, Roberta; Manca, Marina			Indicators of Climate-Driven Change in Long-Term Zooplankton Composition: Insights from Lake Maggiore (Italy)	WATER												Freshwater zooplankton are a key component of lake food webs and a responsive indicator of changes occurring in an ecosystem's structure and functioning. A new challenge under climate change is to disentangle the effects of lake warming from changes in lake trophic conditions, and ultimately to relate them to changes in zooplankton and ecosystem functioning. In this study, we examined the zooplankton community of the large deep subalpine Lake Maggiore (Italy) over a period of four decades, spanning changes in both lake trophic conditions and climate warming. Using monthly data from the upper 50 m of water depth, we analyzed long-term trends and investigated the application of zooplankton biomass-based indices in order to provide a better understanding of the changes in the lake ecosystem over time. Examining annual and seasonal patterns of different zooplankton taxa and groups, we observed over time a decreased contribution of Daphnia sp. during the summer and a concurrent increase in microzooplankton, suggesting a change in phytoplankton control in the lake during the recent period. Our study demonstrates that zooplankton communities integrate environmental changes, and underlines the importance of long-term monitoring and the inclusion of seasonality and the entire size range of zooplankton as key components to allow the interpretation of lake ecosystem functioning in response to trophic and climatic changes.

Differential impacts of a wildfire and post-fire sedimentation event on platypus and fish populations in a Victorian upland river	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Context. Wildfire can affect freshwater ecosystems in many ways, notably when post -fire rainfall washes ash and sediment into waterways. Aims. We investigated species-specific effects of bushfire and subsequent channel sedimentation on the abundance of platypus and fish populations in the upper Buffalo River, Australia. Methods. Pre-and post -fire population surveys were conducted using fyke nets. Key results. There was no evidence that fish numbers declined because of direct fire effects. However, native two-spined blackfish and Macquarie perch numbers dropped dramatically following post -fire sedimentation, whereas non-native redfin perch increased, most likely as a result of migration from a nearby lake. Platypus captures were consistently recorded at all survey sites both before and after the fire and sediment inflows occurred, with many juveniles being recorded in the first post -fire breeding season. Conclusions. The platypus's greater resilience to post -fire sediment inflows than that of native fish presumably reflects its reliance on lungs rather than gills and its ability to take refuge in burrows. It also has a broad diet, flexible foraging behaviour, is highly vagile and typically stores enough fat to support fasting for up to 2-3 weeks. Implications. Management of fire-affected aquatic ecosystems must consider species-specific responses of freshwater vertebrates to fire.

Copper sulfate was added at concentrations of 25-360 .mu.g/l Cu to lakes and 100-3000 .mu.g/l Cu to experimental tubes in early July when A. flos-aquae filaments were about 10 mm in length. Pretreatment chlorophyll a concentrations were 48-55 .mu.g/l and blood species compositions were 90-98% of A. flos-aquae. Excellent algal control was achieved at all treatment concentrations. Typically chlorophyll a declined to 2-4 .mu.g/l after 4 days and A. flos-aquae completely disappeared. Algal biomass remained low for 2-3 wk and then gradually increased. Often Chlorophyta, diatoms and crhysophytes dominated the algal community for the rest of the ice-free season, although in 2 lakes other species of cyanophyta (Microcystis sp.) were predominant. Low concentrations ranging between 25-40 .mu.g/l Cu proved to be effective enough in these lakes. Cu concentration in the water returned to background levels after 8-10 days.																			0269-7491	1873-6424					1978	15	3					185	194		10.1016/0013-9327(78)90064-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0013-9327(78)90064-2													WOS:A1978ES46700002

To demonstrate the formation of such compounds, a pilot water plant supplied with water from Lake Trasimeno was set up at the waterworks of Castiglione del Lago (PG, Italy). The disinfectants, continuously added to prefiltered lake water flowing into three different basins, were sodium hypochlorite, chlorine dioxide and peracetic acid, an alternative disinfectant used until now for disinfecting waste waters, but not yet studied for a possible use in drinking water treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the formation during the disinfection processes of some toxic compounds that could explain the genotoxic effects of drinking waters. Differently treated waters were concentrated by solid-phase adsorption on silica Cis columns and toxicity was assessed in a line of human hepatoma cells (HepG2), a metabolically competent cellular line very useful for human risk evaluation. The seasonal variability of the physical-chemical water characteristics (AOX, UV 254nm, potential formation of THM, pH and temperature) made indispensable experimentation with water samples taken during the various seasons. Autumn waters cause greater toxicity compared to those of other seasons, in particular dilution of the concentrate at 0.51 equivalent of disinfected waters with chlorine dioxide and peracetic acid causes a 55% reduction in cellular vitality while the cellular vitality is over 80% with the all other water concentrates. Moreover it is very interesting underline that non-cytotoxic quantities of the autumnal water concentrates cause, after 2h treatment, a decrease in GSH and a statistically significant increase in oxygen radicals, while after prolonged treatment (24h) cause a GSH increase, without variations in the oxygen radical content. This phenomenon could be interpreted as the cellular adaptation response to an initial oxidative stress. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Broder, T; Knorr, KH; Biester, H				Broder, Tanja; Knorr, Klaus-Holger; Biester, Harald			Changes in dissolved organic matter quality in a peatland and forest headwater stream as a function of seasonality and hydrologic conditions	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Peatlands and peaty riparian zones are major sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM), but are poorly understood in terms of export dynamics and controls thereof. Thereby quality of DOM affects function and behavior of DOM in aquatic ecosystems, but DOM quality can also help to track DOM sources and their export dynamics under specific hydrologic preconditions. The objective of this study was to elucidate controls on temporal variability in DOM concentration and quality in stream water draining a bog and a forested peaty riparian zone, particularly considering drought and storm flow events. DOM quality was monitored using spectrofluorometric indices for aromaticity (SUVA(254)), apparent molecular size (S-R) and precursor organic material (FI), as well as PARAFAC modeling of excitation emission matrices (EEMs). Indices for DOM quality exhibited major changes due to different hydrologic conditions, but patterns were also dependent on season. Stream water at the forested site with mineral, peaty soils generally exhibited higher variability in DOM concentrations and quality compared to the outflow of an ombrotrophic bog, where DOM was less susceptible to changes in hydrologic conditions. During snowmelt and spring events, near-surface protein-like DOM pools were exported. A microbial DOM fraction originating from ground-water and deep peat layers was increasing during drought, while a strongly microbially altered DOM fraction was also exported by discharge events with dry preconditions at the forested site. This might be due to accelerated microbial activity in the peaty riparian zone of the forested site under these preconditions. Our study demonstrated that DOM ex-port dynamics are not only a passive mixing of different hydrological sources, but monitoring studies have to consider that DOM quality depends on hydrologic preconditions and season. Moreover, the forested peaty riparian zone generated the most variability in headwater DOM quantity and quality, as could be tracked by the used spectrofluorometric indices.

J	Tas, B; Gonulol, A				Tas, Beyhan; Gonulol, Arif			An ecologic and taxonomic study on phytoplankton of a shallow lake, Turkey	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												The middle Black sea region has quite large wetlands, including lakes, rivers, ponds, marshs and large reservoirs. Lake Cernek is one of the most valuable wetlands in Kizilirmak Delta. The lake and its environment have a high biodiversity due to species richness and natural habitats. Therefore, it has been recognized as a Ramsar site. The phytoplankton of lake Cernek consisted of 104 taxa belonging to Cyanobacteria, Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta, Cryptophta, Dinophyta, Euglenophyta and Xanthophyta divisions. Chlorophyta (46%) and Bacillariophyta, (23%) members were dominant species, These were followed by Cyanobacteria (16%) and Euglenophyta (11%) members.

A multi-temporal set of 87 images, acquired by Sentinel-2 satellites over three years (2016-2018), provided quantitative information for assessing the temporal evolution of key ecosystem variables in the perialpine Lake Mezzola (northern Italy), which has suffered from the impacts of a massive landslide that took place upstream of the lake basin in summer 2017. Sentinel-2 derived products revealed an increase in lake turbidity triggered by the landslide that amounted to twice the average values scored in the years preceding and following the event. Hotspots of turbidity within the lake were in particular highlighted. Moreover, both submerged and riparian vegetation showed harmful impacts due to sediment deposition. A partial loss of submerged macrophyte cover was found, with delayed growth and a possible community shift in favor of species adapted to inorganic substrates. Satellite-derived seasonal dynamics showed that exceptional sediment load can overwrite climatic factors in controlling phenology of riparian reed beds, resulting in two consecutive years with shorter than normal growing season and roughly 20% drop in productivity, according to spectral proxies. Compared to 2016, senescence came earlier by around 20 days on average in 2017 season, and green-up was delayed by up to 50 days (20 days, on average) in 2018, following the landslide. The approach presented could be easily implemented for continuous monitoring of similar ecosystems subject to external pressures with periods of high sediment loads. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

J	Wolfe, BB; Edwards, TWD				Wolfe, BB; Edwards, TWD			Hydrologic control on the oxygen-isotope relation between sediment cellulose and lake water, western Taimyr Peninsula, Russia: Implications for the use of surface-sediment calibrations in paleolimnology	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Systematic variability occurs between the oxygen isotopic composition of lake water sampled in mid-summer 1993 and cellulose extracted from surficial sediments of a suite of lakes spanning the forest-tundra transition near Noril'sk, Russia. Some tundra and all forest-tundra lakes show greater deviation from expected cellulose-water isotopic separation than forest lakes, apparently because of greater sensitivity to O-18-depleted snowmelt contributions. Cellulose derived from aquatic plants naturally integrates fluctuations in lake water delta(18)O, providing a signal that is inherently more representative of average thaw season lake water delta(18)O than the measure of instantaneous delta(18)O obtained from an individual sample of lake water. Thus, indiscriminate use of empirical cellulose-water relations derived from 'calibration' samples could lead to erroneous assessment of paleohydrology from the oxygen-isotope stratigraphy of sediment cores from arctic lakes. However, deviation from the expected cellulose-water fractionation is a source of lake-specific hydrologic information useful for qualifying paleoenvironmental interpretations and possibly constraining non-isotopic methods that rely on surface-sediment calibrations.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				OCT	1997	18	3					283	291		10.1023/A:1007997422237	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1007997422237													WOS:A1997YD26300007

In Lake Vallentunasjon, Sweden, the pelagic Microcystis-associated bacteria constituted 19-40% of the total bacterial abundance, and their contribution to the total bacterial production was 7-30%. In the sediment, the mucilage bacteria constituted only 1-5% of the total bacterial abundance, but contributed with 8-13% to the total bacterial production during the summer. Microcystis-associated bacteria thus were less active (bacterial production/cell) than ambient water column bacteria, while in the sediments the Microcystis colonies were 'hot spots' with enhanced bacterial activity as compared to other sediment bacteria.

Genetic structure in relation to movements in wild European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) in three Norwegian rivers	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The relationship among genetic structure, movements, and barriers was studied in European grayling (Thymallus thymallus). Gene flow is closely related to movement patterns, and genetic differentiation may be negatively correlated with movement. Grayling movements in the Glomma River (8149 tagged) and the neighboring Trysilelva River (4070 tagged) were different among sampling sites. Most individuals were stationary (+/- 0.5 km), but some individuals moved long distances (<= 153 km). The movement data indicated potential for gene flow between the two upstream sampling sites in the Glomma River and between the two midstream sites in the Trysilelva River. Allele frequencies at seven microsatellite loci indicated pairwise differentiation across sampling sites. Genetic structuring was generally consistent with the observed movement pattern. Isolation-by-linear-distance or number of potential barriers (dams, lakes) was not significant among sites within streams or among sites within the two southern streams. They were significant, however, if two outlying northern populations in the Pasvik River were included. Our results suggest that although grayling may move long distances, they also exhibit genetic structuring within large continuous river systems. Fish movement, often the result of flexible and adaptive behavioral strategies, is the ecological mechanism for gene flow. Movements may be the adaptive link explaining how environmental conditions affect genetic structuring.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JUN	2006	63	6					1309	1319		10.1139/F06-028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F06-028													WOS:000238285700011

Temperature controlled feeding rate, and larval size and time of day exerted no effect. The temperature optimum plateaued between 22.0 and 24.5.degree. C, decreasing logarithmically outside this range. Assimilation efficiency (AE) and organic content of the food varied seasonally, but were not correlated. Periods of high AE corresponded with the latter part of Melosira or Melosira-Stephanodiscus blooms, while periods of low AE occurred between diatom blooms and during the late summer blue-green bloom. Growth fluctuated throughout the year, being a result of the interaction of temperature and AE. Anabolic processes dominated at AE greater than 3.5%. Maximum net growth efficiency (NGE) was attained when AE .gtoreq. 6% and temperature .gtoreq. 15.degree. C. NGE was more sensitive to changes in AE than temperature. Instantaneous growth rate was more sensitive to changes in temperature. Daily ingestion (mg) exceeded body weight by as much as 460-480%, which equals the sediment-processing capacity of freshwater detritivores.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1980	37	8					1254	1265		10.1139/f80-161	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f80-161													WOS:A1980KD15600007
J	Shehu, I				Shehu, Ilir			Water and Sediment Quality Status of the Toplluha River in Kosovo	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The surface water quality and level of metal contents in the contamination of the Toplluha river sediment were determined by means of statistical techniques and pollution indicators. The samples of water and sediments were taken in five different locations along the Toplluha river in the spring period 2013 and 2019 using standard methods for analysis. International standards (WHO 2004) were used to assess the quality of water. The samples of water in some of the locations were above these criteria levels. The heavy metal contents in the sediment were in the following order: Cu > Zn > Cr > Ni > Pb > Cd. For the evaluation of the heavy metal content, some factors were applied: enrichment factor (EF), pollution load index (PLI) and index of geocctunulation (Igeo). Cu and Pb have a significance enrichment according to the calculated EF values. The Igeo index values for Cu and Zn were at a higher level. The PLI index values were at a progressive high level from stations S3 to S5. Therefore, the preliminary treatment of the discharging waters is indispensable.

Lake Van deep drilling project PALEOVAN	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A complete succession of the lacustrine sediment sequence deposited during the last 600,000 years in Lake Van, Eastern Anatolia (Turkey) was drilled in 2010 supported by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP). Based on a detailed seismic site survey, two sites at a water depth of up to 360 m were drilled in summer 2010, and cores were retrieved from sub-lake-floor depths of 140 m (Northern Basin) and 220 m (Ahlat Ridge). To obtain a complete sedimentary section, the two sites were multiple cored in order to investigate the paleoclimate history of a sensitive semi-arid region between the Black, Caspian, and Mediterranean seas. This introductory paper provides background information of the deep drilling project and an overview of the studies presented in this special volume by the PALEOVAN science team dealing with chronology, paleomagnetism, paleoenvironmental proxies, geophysical and petrophysical investigations as well as pore-water and fluid transport.

The observed shoreline sedimentology and stratigraphy indicate that the lake was expanding when the air-fall ash landed onto the lake water. The minimum estimated surface area of the 650 ka lake almost equals that of Lake Bonneville during the Provo stage in late MIS 2.

J	LAWS, EA; WOODCOCK, AH				LAWS, EA; WOODCOCK, AH			HYPER-EUTROPHICATION OF AN HAWAIIAN ALPINE LAKE	PACIFIC SCIENCE												A drought during the period 1977-1978 resulted in a roughly 4-fold reduction in the volume of Lake Waiau, a small perched body of water near the summit of a volcano in Hawaii, and an over 200-fold increase in the late-summer chlorophyll a concentration. The normal planktonic flora of the lake was replaced during this time by an almost complete monoculture of the chlorophyte Nannochloris bacillaris. Nutrients required to support this bloom appear to have been supplied by an influx of interstitial water as a result of the development of an unusual hydrostatic head between the perched groundwater around the lake and lake surface water. The lake had not fully recovered from this episode 2 yr after termination of the drought.																			0030-8870	1534-6188					1981	35	3					257	261																WOS:A1981NE06100008

Whereas both arsenate and arsenite are strongly toxic to life, a number of prokaryotes use these compounds as electron acceptors or donors, respectively, for bioenergetic purposes via respiratory arsenate reductase, arsenite oxidase and alternative arsenite oxidase. The recent burst in discovered arsenite oxidizing and arsenate respiring microbes suggests the arsenic bioenergetic metabolisms to be anything but exotic. The first goal of the present review is to bring to light the widespread distribution and diversity of these metabolizing pathways. The second goal is to present an evolutionary analysis of these diverse energetic pathways. Taking into account not only the available data on the arsenic metabolizing enzymes and their phylogenetical relatives but also the palaeogeochemical records, we propose a crucial role of arsenite oxidation via arsenite oxidase in primordial life.

J	Thomas, EK; Szymanski, J; Briner, JP				Thomas, Elizabeth K.; Szymanski, Jason; Briner, Jason P.			Holocene alpine glaciation inferred from lacustrine sediments on northeastern Baffin Island, Arctic Canada	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												With accelerated melting of alpine glaciers, understanding the future state of the cryosphere is critical. Because the observational record of glacier response to climate change is short, palaeo-records of glacier change are needed. Using proglacial lake sediments, which contain continuous and datable records of past glacier activity, we investigate Holocene glacier fluctuations on northeastern Baffin Island. Basal radiocarbon ages from three lakes constrain Laurentide Ice Sheet retreat by ca. 10.5 ka. High sedimentation rates (0.03 cm a(-1)) and continuous minerogenic sedimentation throughout the Holocene in proglacial lakes, in contrast to organic-rich sediments and low sedimentation rates (0.005 cm a(-1)) in neighbouring non-glacial lakes, suggest that glaciers may have persisted in proglacial lake catchments since regional deglaciation. The presence of varves and relatively high magnetic susceptibility from 10 to 6 ka and since 2 ka in one proglacial lake suggest minimum Holocene glacier extent ca. 6-2 ka. Moraine evidence and proglacial and threshold lake sediments indicate that the maximum Holocene glacier extent occurred during the Little Ice Age. The finding that glaciers likely persisted through the Holocene is surprising, given that regional proxy records reveal summer temperatures several degrees warmer than today, and may be clue to shorter ablation seasons and greater accumulation-season precipitation.

However, traditional point-based water quality monitoring methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, and insufficient to estimate and assess water quality at a large scale. In this paper, we constructed machine learning models for TP and TN inversion using measured data and satellite imagery band reflectance, and verified it by in situ data. Atmospheric correction was performed on the Landsat Top of Atmosphere (TOP) data by removing the effect of the adjacency effect and correcting differences between Landsat sensors. Then, using the established model, the TP and TN patterns in Dongting Lake with a spatial resolution of 30 m from 1996 to 2021 were derived for the first time. The annual and monthly spatio-temporal variation characteristics of TP and TN in Dongting Lake were investigated in details, and the influences of hydrometeorological elements on water quality variations were analyzed. The results show that the established empirical model can accurately estimate TP with coefficient (R-2) >= 0.70, root mean square error (RMSE) <= 0.057 mg/L, mean relative error (MRE) <= 0.23 and TN with R-2 >= 0.73, RMSE <= 0.48 mg/L and MRE <= 0.20. From 1996 to 2021, TP in Dongting Lake showed a downward trend and TN showed an upward trend, while the summer value was much higher than the other seasons. Furthermore, the influencing factors on TP and TN variations were investigated and discussed. Between 1996 and 2003, the main contributors to the change of water quality in Dongting Lake were external inputs such as water level and flow. The significant changes in water quantity and sediment characteristics following the operation of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) in 2003 also had an impact on the water quality in Dongting Lake.					; Guo, Hongwei/HMD-6491-2023; Jin, Shuanggen/B-8094-2008; Wang, Ning/JTS-4559-2023	Pellikka, Petri/0000-0002-5996-9268; Zhang, Yuanyuan/0000-0001-9429-6305; Wang, Ning/0000-0002-9933-0725; Jin, Shuanggen/0000-0002-5108-4828; 														2072-4292				NOV	2022	14	22							5648	10.3390/rs14225648	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14225648													WOS:000887755300001

Emission of Greenhouse Gases From Water Tracks Draining Arctic Hillslopes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Experimental and ambient warming of Arctic tundra results in emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, contributing to a positive feedback to climate warming. Estimates of gas emissions from lakes and terrestrial tundra confirm the significance of aquatic fluxes in greenhouse gas budgets, whereas few estimates describe emissions from fluvial networks. We measured dissolved gas concentrations and estimated emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from water tracks, vegetated depressions that hydrologically connect hillslope soils to lakes and streams. Concentrations of trace gases generally increased as ground thaw deepened through the growing season, indicating active production of greenhouse gases in thawed soils. Wet antecedent conditions were correlated with a decline in CO2 and CH4 concentrations. Dissolved N2O in excess of atmospheric equilibrium occurred in drier water tracks, but on average water tracks took up N2O from the atmosphere at low rates. Estimated CO2 emission rates for water tracks were among the highest observed for Arctic aquatic ecosystems, whereas CH4 emissions were of similar magnitude to streams. Despite occupying less than 1% of total catchment area, surface waters within water tracks were an estimated source of up to 53-85% of total CH4 emissions from their catchments and offset the terrestrial C sink by 5-9% during the growing season. Water tracks are abundant features of tundra landscapes that contain warmer soils and incur deeper thaw than adjacent terrestrial ecosystems and as such might contribute to ongoing and accelerating release of greenhouse gases from permafrost soils to the atmosphere.

In 1984 an enclosure experiment was carried out in order to elucidate the importance of nutrient supply from fish to phytoplankton during the critical summer period in eutrophic Lake Balaton. One enclosure was stocked with fish and the other left empty. 2. Two peaks were recorded in primary production reaching maximum values in the fish enclosure. 3. In the enclosure with fish, inorganic nitrogen concentrations increased gradually till the end of the experiment, with ammonia making up the largest component. Lower dissolved phosphorus concentrations in the fish enclosure, with its higher primary production rate, may indicate an intense cycling of this nutrient. 4. The biological and chemical changes occurring in the enclosure suggest that bream removal can be an effective tool in water quality control for Lake Balaton.

Young of the year appear to have an ultimate upper incipient lethal temperature slightly above 30.degree. C. Published values of thermal tolerance of the adults may be low because of the difficulty of obtaining healthy specimens for experimentation.

The aim is to identify environmental parameters governing spatial and temporal differences in phytoplankton density and composition. Physicochemical parameters, including nutrient concentrations, were determined in monthly surface water samples from 2015. The average concentration of key eutrophication indexes (i.e., total phosphorous (TP: 0.24 +/- 0.11 mgL(-1)), total nitrogen (TN: 2.96 +/- 1.60 mgL(-1)), and Chlorophyll a (Chl a: 38.5 +/- 11.5 mgm(-3))) substantially exceeded threshold values for eutrophic streams. Moreover, the eutrophication increased significantly downstream along the river reservoir as a consequence of an increasing fraction of agricultural and industrial land-use in the watershed. 103 phytoplankton species were identified, of which Chlorophyta was the dominated phylum (47 species), followed by Bacillariophyta (23 species) and Cyanophyta (18 species). No spatial difference in species distribution (ANOVA, p > 0.05) were found, while the temporal differences in species composition exhibited significant heterogeneity (ANOVA, p < 0.001). Phytoplankton abundance was highest in early summer (June and July), with maximum values increasing from 1.78 x 10(8) and 2.80 x 10(8) cellsL(-1) in upstream and middle reaches, respectively, to 4.18 x 10(8) cellsL(-1) furthest downstream. Cyanophyta, also known as Cyanobacteria and commonly referred to as blue-green algal, are known to constitute algae bloom in eutrophic systems. Common species are Microcystis marginata, Microcystis flos-aquae, and Oscillatoria sp. This was the dominant phyla during summer months, especially in the middle and lower reaches of the stream reservoir where it accounted for 88.9% of the phytoplankton community. Shannon weaver index (H') and Pielous's evenness index (J') were extremely low (1.91-2.43 for H' and 0.39-0.45 for J') in samples collected from the lower part of the stream during the period of algal bloom, indicating an imbalance in the phytoplankton communities. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that water temperature (WT) and possible pH, along with nitrate (NO3-N) and nitrite (NO2-N), were the most important explanatory parameters in regard to phytoplankton composition. This research provides an understanding of the role of physicochemical water quality parameters in governing algal blooms and phytoplankton composition in river reservoirs.

J	McDonald, ME; Hershey, AE; Miller, MC				McDonald, ME; Hershey, AE; Miller, MC			Global warming impacts on lake trout in arctic lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY					Symposium on Regional Assessment of Freshwater Ecosystems and Climate Change in North America	OCT 24-26, 1994	LEESBURG, VA	Amer Soc Limnol & Oceanog, N Amer Benthol Soc, US EPA, US Geol Survey				Arctic freshwater ecosystems may be sensitive indicators of climatic warming trends because they have relatively few species and simple food webs. Many of these systems are dominated by lake trout, which act as keystone predators. For arctic Alaska Toolik Lake, we have a 16-yr record of physical, chemical, and biological data. Our temperature data show a 3 degrees C increase in mean July epilimnetic temperatures. An individual-based bioenergetics model for young-of-year (YOY) lake trout in the lake was used to examine the effects of climate warming on growth of YOY lake trout. Our simulation models predicted that with a July temperature increase, YOY lake trout would need to consume >8-fold more food (>10-fold with seasonally increased temperatures) to achieve the same end-of-year size as historically surviving YOY lake trout. We have observed no increase in food availability in the lake, and recent analysis shows that primary productivity has actually decreased. If recent changes in the lake foreshadow a long-term trend, our model results suggest that YOY lake trout will not survive their first winter. Such changes, coupled with other current anthropogenic impacts in the arctic, may disrupt lake trout control of the trophic structure in arctic lakes.																			0024-3590					JUL	1996	41	5					1102	1108		10.4319/lo.1996.41.5.1102	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1996.41.5.1102													WOS:A1996VN45800033

Spatial Distribution and Seasonal Variation of Heavy Metals in Water and Sediments of Taihu Lake	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												Heavy metal distribution in aquatic ecosystems can be influenced by a variety of factors. In this study, the spatial distribution and seasonal variation of heavy metals (Cd, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cr, and Pb) in lake water and sediments of different lake zones of a large, shallow, eutrophic freshwater lake, Taihu Lake, were investigated. Metal concentrations in the river water, bloom assemblages, and macrophyte materials were also determined. The results demonstrated that metal distribution in Taihu Lake showed distinct patterns in different seasons. Metal concentrations in rivers around Taihu Lake showed some peaks that may contribute to the elevated metal concentrations in lake water and sediments. However, the metal concentrations in the river water did not fluctuate significantly with months (March, July, and December). The dissolved metal concentrations in the phytoplankton-dominated zone of the lake were significantly higher than those in the macrophyte-dominated lake zone in summer, which could be attributed to the different dominated primary producers in the two lake zones. Statistical analysis results demonstrated that the dissolved metal concentrations were positively correlated with water turbidity for all metals in July. However, the positive correlations disappeared for most metals of March and December samples. The results of this study could provide useful information for further understanding of the transportation and fates of heavy metals in different freshwater lake ecosystems.

A late quaternary ostracod record from the Tso Kar basin (North India) with a note on the distribution of recent species	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The fossil ostracod associations from a radiocarbon dated sediment core (15.3-0 cal kyr) of the high altitude (4,527 m a.s.l.) hyperhaline Tso Kar lake in North India reveal changes in ostracod species abundances and composition. These document the process of lake formation and ongoing desiccation during the latest quaternary and broadly confirm the results of previous geochemical, geomorphological and pollen analysis. The most striking feature of the core record is a period of freshwater conditions between 9.0 and 6.5 cal kyr BP, as calculated by means of an ostracod-based conductivity transfer function. This early- to mid-Holocene interval of the core correlates with similar ostracod assemblages (Cytherissa lacustris-Candona candida-Eucypris afghanistanensis) of an outcrop section at the basin margin, about 98 m above the modern lake level and marks the highest lake level under the influence of an intensified Indian Summer Monsoon. After 6.5 cal kyr BP, Limnocythere inopinata is the sole representative of the ostracod fauna in the sediment core, which suggests rising salinity conditions most probably due to lake shallowing. From 3.2 cal kyr BP to present, the near absence of ostracods in the core Tk106 is most likely a consequence of salinisation of the lake towards the hyperhaline conditions that are realised at present. Although the modern morphology and physico-chemical properties of Tso Kar lake are in contrast to the past lake conditions, most of the ostracod species, except for Limnocythere mirabilis found in the sediment core, are also identified from surface sediment and outcrop samples. In contrast, Heterocypris salina and Eucypris dulcifons are widespread in the shallow surface waters with a total dissolved solids content ranging from 0.6 to 15.0 g L-1, but are excluded from the core record and outcrop strata. At a basinal scale, the lake shrinkage and segregation into the Tso Kar and hydrologically open freshwater lake Startsapuk Tso have forced diversification of ostracod taxa, probably as an effect of the emergence of new ecological niches under enhanced "environmental pressure".																			0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2014	51	4					549	565		10.1007/s10933-014-9773-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-014-9773-7													WOS:000333057800007

However, their production and potential coverage are hampered by the harsh climate conditions. In this study, we investigated the potential for increased macrophyte production and coverage in arctic lakes in a future warmer climate. In situ growth experiments with Callitriche hamulata were performed at 2, 4, 8 and 12 m depth in combination with nutrient assay experiments at 2 m depth. In addition, growth experiments were performed in the laboratory at four temperatures (5, 10, 15 and 20 degrees C) under saturated and light-limited conditions (150 and 25 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). The results show that macrophyte growth in the low arctic lake, Badeso, is phosphorus limited, but they also indicate that nutrients are not the limiting factor for the macrophyte depth distribution. Rather the short growing season combined with low summer temperatures may limit the expansion of C. hamulata. Our study also shows that C. hamulata is a very temperature-sensitive plant, particularly around 10 degrees C. In a future warmer climate in the arctic, the thermocline in clear lakes is expected to expand deeper into the water column. Thus, at the present light conditions we can expect an expansion of both colonisation depth and coverage, which may affect the overall primary production in arctic lakes and the carbon flux and carbon cycling in the lake systems. Our findings strongly support recent predictions of increased growth and a more northerly distribution range of cold-temperature submerged macrophytes.

J	Hawley, N				Hawley, N			Response of the benthic nepheloid layer to near-inertial internal waves in southern Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												[1] Time series measurements of water transparency, water temperature, and current velocity were made at a station located in 58 m of water in southern Lake Michigan during the summer of 1995. Currents generated by near-inertial internal waves are correlated with variations in the thickness and in the vertical distribution of suspended sediment in the benthic nepheloid layer. Although a direct causal link between internal wave action and changes in the nepheloid layer could not be established, the data suggest that local resuspension by shoaling internal waves maintains the layer during the stratified period. The origin and maintenance of the benthic nepheloid layer is most likely the result of local resuspension due to a combination of internal wave action and longer-term processes.																			2169-9275	2169-9291				APR 7	2004	109	C4							C04007	10.1029/2003JC002128	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2003JC002128													WOS:000220917400002

The evening bat (Nycticeius humeralis) is a medium-sized vespertilionid that is widely distributed over a span of 17 degrees of latitude, from the Gulf of Mexico northward to the Great Lakes in North America. In the core of their range, evening bats prefer mature and commonly available trees that are located close to water sources as maternity roosts. However, data are lacking on roost selection by this wide-ranging species in the periphery of its distribution. In this study, we examined roost selection of the evening bat at the northern edge of its continental range. We radio tracked 44 evening bats in Michigan, United States, and identified 33 maternity trees. We collected variables at individual tree, plot, and landscape scales and compared roost and randomly selected trees. Although evening bats preferred roosting in Fraxinus (ash), we found that the evening bat was a generalist in its choice of roost genera, as long as the tree receives sufficient solar exposure, which is presumably important at the cool, northern edge of its range. At the landscape level, evening bats favored roosts surrounded by a less dense canopy, which would provide easy access for a flying bat and allow considerable solar radiation to strike the tree for additional warmth. We also found that evening bats preferred forest sections with more forest-farmland edges. We suspected that evening bats at the northern edge of their range show less preference in roost selection than evening bats in the core of their range. This flexibility in roost selection could allow the evening bat to expand further north if summers become warmer and other tree-roosting species decline due to white-nose syndrome, thus providing competitive release.

J	Galloway, AWE; Winder, M				Galloway, Aaron W. E.; Winder, Monika			Partitioning the Relative Importance of Phylogeny and Environmental Conditions on Phytoplankton Fatty Acids	PLOS ONE												Essential fatty acids (EFA), which are primarily generated by phytoplankton, limit growth and reproduction in diverse heterotrophs. The biochemical composition of phytoplankton is well-known to be governed both by phylogeny and environmental conditions. Nutrients, light, salinity, and temperature all affect both phytoplankton growth and fatty acid composition. However, the relative importance of taxonomy and environment on algal fatty acid content has yet to be comparatively quantified, thus inhibiting predictions of changes to phytoplankton food quality in response to global environmental change. We compiled 1145 published marine and freshwater phytoplankton fatty acid profiles, consisting of 208 species from six major taxonomic groups, cultured in a wide range of environmental conditions, and used a multivariate distance-based linear model to quantify the total variation explained by each variable. Our results show that taxonomic group accounts for 3-4 times more variation in phytoplankton fatty acids than the most important growth condition variables. The results underscore that environmental conditions clearly affect phytoplankton fatty acid profiles, but also show that conditions account for relatively low variation compared to phylogeny. This suggests that the underlying mechanism determining basal food quality in aquatic habitats is primarily phytoplankton community composition, and allows for prediction of environmental- scale EFA dynamics based on phytoplankton community data. We used the compiled dataset to calculate seasonal dynamics of long-chain EFA (LCEFA; >= C-20-omega 3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid) concentrations and omega-3 omega-6 EFA ratios in Lake Washington using a multi-decadal phytoplankton community time series. These analyses quantify temporal dynamics of algal-derived LCEFA and food quality in a freshwater ecosystem that has undergone large community changes as a result of shifting resource management practices, highlighting diatoms, cryptophytes and dinoflagellates as key sources of LCEFA. Moreover, the analyses indicate that future shifts towards cyanobacteria-dominated communities will result in lower LCEFA content in aquatic ecosystems.

J	SMITH, AT; GAO, WX				SMITH, AT; GAO, WX			SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS OF ADULT BLACK-LIPPED PIKAS (OCHOTONA-CURZONIAE)	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												Adult spatial and social relationships in a marked population of black-lipped pikas (Ochotona curzoniae) were studied during the reproductive season from April to July near Qinghai Lake, People's Republic of China. Families of pikas occupied relatively discrete home ranges that contained a burrow system with many entrances in continuous alpine-meadow habitat. Some burrow systems contained a monogamous pair of breeding adults; in others one male controlled access to two or more females. During the breeding period, adult males vigorously guarded females with which they were associated. Young from three sequential large litters occupied their natal home ranges and did not disperse during the reproductive season. Density on individual home ranges increased throughout the study, and population density reached ca. 300 animals/ha following emergence of the third litter. Most interactions among adults involved reproduction (following, approaching, mating) and occurred early in the summer. Most social interactions were affiliative and were between adults and juveniles within family home ranges. Most of these interactions involved adult males. Adult males also were responsible for most other behaviors that could be associated with vigilance and awareness of the social milieu on the meadow and with maintenance of home-range quality. There was no indication that rate of affiliative behavior differed among males from variable mating systems.																			0022-2372					MAY	1991	72	2					231	247		10.2307/1382094	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1382094													WOS:A1991FN19600001

While fresh water algae living in colder water can produce offensive fishy odors, their environmental behaviors remain poorly understood. In this study, two chrysophyte species (Synura uvella and Ochromonas sp.), which are often associated with fishy odor events, were selected to investigate the effect of temperature (8,16, and 24 degrees C) and light intensity (10, 41, and 185 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) on algal growth and odorant production. Five polyunsaturated aldehyde derivatives, including 2,4-heptadienal, 2-octenal, 2,4-octadienal, 2,4-decadienal, and 2,4,7-dectridienal, were identified as fishy/cod liver oil/fatty/rancid descriptors in the cultures of the two algae based on gas chromatography-olfactometry-mass spectrometry and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography mass spectrometry. While biomass yield increased with the increase in temperature for both species, significantly higher odorant yields (production of odorants per cell) were obtained at 8 degrees C. The total odorant production and cell yield of the odorants decreased with the increase in light intensity from 10 to 185 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1). The biodegradation half-lives for the released odorants were 6-10 hat 8 degrees C and 2-4 hat 24 degrees C, whereas the volatilization half-lives were 36-97 d at 8 degrees C and 6-17 d at 24 degrees C, suggesting that temperature dependent biodegradation was an important factor controlling the fate of fishy compounds in aquatic environments. The results of this study will help clarify why most fishy odor events occur in cooler seasons, and provide knowledge related to cold water persistence for the management of fishy odor problems associated with algae.

Once the chronology is established, environmental changes in lakes can be investigated, and the causes for those changes can often be inferred. Pb-210 and Cs-137 profiles were constructed for the sediments of Crystal Lake, Connecticut, USA. The geochronology was used to determine the historical changes in organic matter and P accumulation in the sediment. Those profiles showed two significant periods of sedimentation which correlate with major precipitation events. Decreasing P accumulation in the sediments of the lake in the last decade was also correlated with increasing eutrophication as documented by increases in epilimnetic P and decreases in transparency.

The 2007 water crisis in Wuxi, China: Analysis of the origin	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												An odorous tap water crisis that affected two million residents for several days occurred in Wuxi, China in the summer of 2007. Volatile sulfide chemicals including methyl thiols, dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide, and dimethyl trisulfide were the dominant odorous contaminants in Lake Taihu and in tap water during the crisis. These contaminants originated from the decomposition of a massive cyanobacterial bloom that was triggered by illegal industrial discharges and inadequately regulated domestic pollution. A specific emergency drinking water treatment process was quickly developed using a combination of potassium permanganate oxidation and powdered activated carbon adsorption. The emergency treatment process removed the odor from the tap water and solved the crisis successfully in several days. This experience underscores the suggestion that a combination of stresses associated with eutrophication and industrial and domestic wastewater discharges can push an aquatic system to the tipping point with consequences far more severe than would occur if the system were subjected to each stress separately.

Vegetation, climate and culture in Central Ganga plain, India: A multi-proxy record for Last Glacial Maximum	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Multi-proxy study of a 240 cm deep Lashoda Tal (lake) sediment profile, located adjacent to an archaeological mound in Central Ganga Plain, highlights the climate induced changes in the vegetation, ecology and culture since similar to 25500 cal BP. Between similar to 25500 and 22200 cal BP, the region shows grassland, incipient drainage and small ponds formed seasonally with moisture loving terrestrial thecamoeba suggesting supply of moisture in short spells under the winter monsoon regime. The sediment became sandy and invaded by trees during similar to 22200 to 14300 cal BP indicating an increase in lake levels with more aquatic pollen and algal forms portraying the strengthened monsoon and high energy fluvial system. This observation is further supported by low percentage of thecamoeba. Subsequently, the climate became increasingly supportive showing low seasonality and formation of meandering channels, which favoured aquatic weeds and meadew-cutoffs with marshy areas and dense vegetation in the vicinity during similar to 14300 to 7100 cal BP. High arboreal and non-arboreals pollen and thecamoebian diversity with, change in nature of sediment (increasing clay content) suggest the expansion of Lashoda lake ecosystem similar to 7100 cal BP. Since the last 2 millennium and until similar to 1550 AD the studied site was under immense human pressure of Kushana, Gupta and Mughal cultures, which is evident by the artifacts recovered from the mound situated near the study site. The palynological study revealed reduced monsoon, fragmentation or desiccation of lake ecosystem similar to 1550 AD, which is attributed to geomorphological changes caused by the ameliorating climate. The records of Cerealia pollen similar to 1300 cal BP indicate expansion of agricultural activities that might have affected the lake ecosystem.

MODEL CALCULATIONS OF TOTAL MAXIMUM DAILY LOADS OF MERCURY FOR DRAINAGE LAKES	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												The Watershed Analysis Risk Management Framework watershed model was enhanced to simulate the transport and fate of mercury and to calculate the fish mercury concentrations (FMC) attained by fish through the food web. The model was applied to Western Lake Superior Basin of Minnesota, which has many peat lands and lakes. Topographic, land use, and soil data were used to set up the model. Meteorology and precipitation chemistry data from nearby monitoring stations were compiled to drive the model. Simulated flow and mercury concentrations for several stream stations were comparable to available data. The model was used to perform mercury total maximum daily load calculations for two contrasting drainage lakes (Wild Rice Lake and Whiteface Reservoir). The model results for wet deposition, dry deposition, evasion, watershed yield, and soil sequestration of mercury were comparable with available actual data. The model predicted lake ice cover from November to April and weak stratification in summer, typical of shallow lakes in cold regions. The simulated sulfate decrease and methylmercury increase near the lake bottom in late summer are caused by sulfate reduction and mercury methylation that occur in the surficial sediment. Simulated FMC were within the range of observed values and the R-2 of correlation between the simulated and observed FMC was 0.77. Under the 1989-2004 base condition, the average simulated FMC of four-year-old walleye was 0.31 mu g /g for Whiteface Reservoir and 0.15 mu g /g for Wild Rice Lake. The FMC criterion in Minnesota is 0.2 mu g /g. Wild Rice Lake already meets this criterion without any load reduction. The model showed that a 65% reduction in atmospheric mercury deposition will not, by itself, allow Whiteface Reservoir to meet the criterion in 15 years. Additional best management practices will be needed to reduce 50% of the watershed input.																			1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2008	44	5					1295	1307		10.1111/j.1752-1688.2008.00224.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2008.00224.x													WOS:000259865100019
J	Lybbert, TJ; Thilmany, DD				Lybbert, TJ; Thilmany, DD			Migration effects of Olympic siting: A pooled time series cross-sectional analysis of host regions	ANNALS OF REGIONAL SCIENCE												There has been considerable opposition to the 2002 Winter Olympics, to be held in the Salt Lake City metro area. This opposition stems primarily from fears of increased population growth due to the international attention. Proponents maintain that the Games will enhance the quality and quantity of jobs in the local economy, mitigating any undesirable impacts. This paper analyzes the experiences of past North American Olympic host regions, rather than the single case of Salt Lake City, to determine whether concerns are substantiated. Findings show that most population growth effects relate to the announcement of the Olympics rather than the actual hosting of the event. While the Olympics are likely to attract jobs to the host region, the nature of this employment growth and its effect on per-capita income are questionable.																			0570-1864					AUG	2000	34	3					405	420		10.1007/s001689900017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s001689900017													WOS:000089508700005

Samples for DNA, toxin, and phycological analyses were collected from six stations throughout the summers of 2002 (78 samples) and 2003 (95 samples). DNA was amplified by PCR using primer sets specific to the nonribosomal microcystin synthetase complex (mcyB and mcyD). PCR analysis in 2002 indicated that the microcystin genes were present in the water column from mid-June through October, as 88% of the samples tested positive for mcyB and 79% of the samples tested positive for mcyD. In both years the onset of microcystin production was detected as early as mid-July by the protein phosphatase inhibition assay, reaching a maximum in 2002 of 2.9 mu g L-1 and in 2003 of 3.4 mu g L-1. Beginning in mid- to late August of both years the microcystin level at all six stations was in excess of the World Health Organization (WHO) advisory level of 1.0 mu g L-1. In the present study we compared microcystin occurrence and potential production at the six stations using protein phosphatase inhibition assay, high-performance liquid chromatography, and polymerase chain reaction analyses.

In 1984, Lake Druksiai was transformed into a cooling water reservoir of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant (INPP). The greatest impact of elevated water temperatures was on the fish species composition. Roach (Rutilus rutilus) adapted itself best to water temperatures averaging in summer month 30-degrees-C, and it grew faster, while other species became much less common. The mollusc Dreissena polymorpha Pall. became an important source of food for roach. When the long-term temperature exceeded 30-degrees-C, the rate of growth of roach slowed down.																			0020-9309						1994	79	1					139	142		10.1002/iroh.19940790113	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19940790113													WOS:A1994NM81400011

The vertical intake of its headrace was formed by means of lake tapping. A physical model was used to help understand the blasting process involving fragmented rock, water, air, and gas. Upon commissioning of the unit, swirling flows occurred unexpectedly at the intake, which gave rise to negative consequences including limitations in power output. Echo-sounding showed that the blasted piercing resulted in an irregular intake. A hydraulic model, as part of the design process, was built to examine potential countermeasures for vortex suppression. The final solution was a segmented barrier between the intake and the dam. It effectively suppressed the intake flow circulations; only minor intermittent vortices were left. The fabricated steel segments were anchored into the bedrock, stretching to 1.0 m below the lowest legal reservoir level. The local intake headloss was also reduced. The implemented solution was tested under full turbine loading and the result was satisfactory. Even during winter seasons with ice cover above the wall, the power station ran normally. The case study is expected to provide guidance for solving similar problems with vortex formation.					; Teng, Penghua/AGW-3081-2022	Yang, James/0000-0002-4242-3824; Teng, Penghua/0000-0001-7631-3503; 														2073-4441				JUL	2018	10	7							881	10.3390/w10070881	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10070881													WOS:000442579700064

A 2000-year record of flooding from the He ' rault River basin was reconstructed using magnetic susceptibility data from lagoon deposits, supported by documentary databases of floods in coastal river basins from Languedoc over the last centuries. Flooding was particularly important between 800 and 1350 cal CE, i.e. during the warm climatic conditions of the Medieval Climate Anomaly. Moreover, several periods of increased flooding occurred in the 2nd, 6th-7th, 16th, 18th and 20th centuries. Increased flooding was significantly correlated with higher air temperature in the northwestern Mediterranean and with higher sea surface temperature in the Gulf of Lions. The analysis of relationships between river flooding and atmospheric conditions shows that autumn flood events in Languedoc were generally more frequent during the positive phase of the East Atlantic pattern, which is associated with southerly to southeasterly winds in the Gulf of Lions. Besides, increased flooding could also have been controlled by forest decline and human activities after 500 cal CE. Between 1400 and 1800 cal CE, palaeobotanical data show an intensification of land use characterized by an expansion of grasslands and cultivated areas in the coastal lowlands east of the He ' rault River. Forest clearings and the development of agriculture seem to have led to a relative increase in river flooding, especially in the late Middle Ages and early modern period.

This is also true for harmful algal blooms, which have been reported to have increased in frequency. However, this research is challenging due to the ephemeral nature, small size and mostly low concentrations of microalgae in the environment. One such species is the nuisance microalga Gonyostomum semen (Raphidophyceae), which has increased in occurrence in northern Europe in recent decades. The question of whether the species has expanded its habitat range or if it was already present in the lakes but was too rare to be detected remains unanswered. The aim of the present study was to determine the genetic structure and dispersal pathways of G. semen using RAD (restriction-site-associated DNA) tag sequencing. For G. semen, which has a huge genome (32 Gbp), we faced particular challenges, but were nevertheless able to recover over 1000 single nucleotide polymorphisms at high coverage. Our data revealed a distinct population genetic structure, demonstrating a divide of western and eastern populations that probably represent different lineages. Despite significant genetic differentiation among lakes, we found only limited isolation-by-distance. While we had expected a pattern of recent expansion northwards, the data demonstrated gene flow from the northeast/east towards the southwest/west. This genetic signature suggests that the observed gene flow may be due to dispersal by autumn migratory birds, which act as dispersal vectors of resistant resting propagules that form at the end of the G. semen blooms.

J	Liao, KJ; Hou, XT; Baker, DR				Liao, Kuo-Jen; Hou, Xiangting; Baker, Debra Ratterman			Impacts of interstate transport of pollutants on high ozone events over the Mid-Atlantic United States	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												The impacts of interstate transport of anthropogenic nitrogen oxides (N0x) and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions on peak ozone formation in four nonattainment areas (i.e., Baltimore, Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, Pittsburgh-Beaver Valley and Washington, DC) in the MidAtlantic U.S. were quantified in this study. Regional air quality and sensitivities of ground-level ozone to emissions from four regions in the eastern U.S. were simulated for three summer months (June, July and August) in 2007 using the U.S. EPA's Community Multiscale Air Quality model with the decoupled direct method 3D. The emissions inventory used in this study was the 2007 Mid-Atlantic Regional Air Management Association Level 2 inventory, developed for State Implementation Plan screening modeling for the Ozone Transport Commission region. The modeling results show that responses of peak ozone levels at specific locations to emissions from ECU (i.e., electric generating unit) and non-EGU sources could be different. Therefore, emissions from ECU and non-EGU sources should be considered as two different control categories when developing regional air pollution mitigation strategies. Based on the emission inventories used in this study, reductions in anthropogenic NOx emissions (including those from ECU and non-ECU sources) from the Great Lake region as well as northeastern and southeastern U.S. would be effective for decreasing area-mean peak ozone concentrations during the summer of 2007 in the Mid-Atlantic ozone air quality nonattainment areas. The results also show that reductions in anthropogenic VOC emissions from the northeastern U.S. would also be effective for decreasing areamean peak ozone concentrations over the Mid-Atlantic U.S. In some cases, reductions in anthropogenic NOx emissions from the Great Lake and northeastern U.S. could slightly increase area-mean peak ozone concentrations at some ozone monitors in the Pittsburgh-Beaver Valley and Washington, DC areas. However, the disbenefit of the slight increase in ozone concentrations attributed to the NOx emission controls was far outweighed by the overall ozone air quality benefits over the Mid-Atlantic region.

J	Coleman, JT; Coleman, LA				Coleman, Jonathan t.; Coleman, Lucy a.			Variability in the breeding season of Black Swans Cygnus atratus in southeast Queensland, Australia	WILDFOWL												Variability in the duration of the breeding season and the mean number of annual breeding attempts recorded for Black Swans Cygnus atratus in southeast Queensland, Australia, were evaluated in relation to environmental variables. There was a significant correlation between the extent of the breeding season (measured as the number of months in which eggs were hatched) with both the number of breeding attempts made by paired birds in that year and also the number of territorial pairs recorded. This may reflect changes in the timing of breeding by individual pairs to reduce competition for favoured breeding and foraging locations. The number of breeding attempts per territorial pair in any one year was influenced primarily by summer rainfall and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), with higher values for both of these environmental variables being associated with more breeding attempts and increasing numbers of breeding pairs. We therefore suggest that the increasing numbers of breeding pairs, and also the increasing numbers of breeding attempts associated with more favourable weather conditions, may have led to the longer breeding seasons recorded for Black Swans in southeast Queensland in recent years.																			0954-6324	2052-6458					2024					7		252	265																WOS:001445333100013

Study focus: Stable isotopes of Godavari River water in a pre-monsoon (dry) and monsoon (wet) season are used to evaluate seasonal and spatial dynamics and gain insights into hydrological processes, provenance and pathways of river water from source to sea. New hydrological insights: Godavari River water isotopes shift from an evaporation- to precipitation-controlled signature between the pre-monsoon and monsoon season (p <= 0.001). Godavari waters plot below Global and Local Meteoric Water Lines (p <= 0.01), highlighting the importance of evaporation. In the monsoon season, low delta O-18 and delta D values in the downstream catchment reflect an amount/convective effect caused by Southwest monsoonal rainfall. Continuously enriched signatures in the Upper Godavari suggest year-round evaporation due to a rainfall deficit and abundant dams creating stagnant waters. The Godavari ultimately discharges an integrated, monsoon signal into the Bay of Bengal. River depth profiles reveal that Godavari waters are well-mixed in both seasons. In the pre-monsoon season, Godavari water isotopes suggest basin-wide evaporation and seawater intrusion in the delta. A data compilation (n = 399) of delta O-18 and delta D values in Indian Rivers reveals a strong seasonality for the Godavari River. sensitive recorders of monsoon precipitation variability and hydrological processes within monsoon-fed rivers.

In stark contrast, the Antarctic Peninsula experienced some of the most rapid warming on the planet at the end of the last century(2,3,7,8) causing changes to the growth and distribution of plants(9-11). Here, we show that vegetation in the Windmill Islands, East Antarctica is changing rapidly in response to a drying climate. This drying trend is evident across the region, as demonstrated by changes in isotopic signatures measured along moss shoots(12,13), moss community composition and declining health, as well as long-term observations of lake salinity(14) and weather. The regional drying is possibly due to the more positive Southern Annular Mode in recent decades. The more positive Southern Annular Mode is a consequence of Antarctic ozone depletion and increased greenhouse gases, and causes strong westerly winds to circulate closer to the continent, maintaining colder temperatures in East Antarctica despite the increasing global average(15-18). Colder summers in this region probably result in reduced snow melt and increased aridity. We demonstrate that rapid vegetation change is occurring in East Antarctica and that its mosses provide potentially important proxies for monitoring coastal climate change.					; Robinson, Sharon/B-2683-2008; Hua, Quan/F-9593-2014; King, Diana/K-1061-2019; Clarke, Laurence/N-3579-2017; Ryan-Colton, Ellen/HKV-0815-2023; Waterman, Melinda/N-5880-2019; Wasley, Jane/KHX-4880-2024	King, Diana/0000-0001-6313-4450; Ashcroft, Michael/0000-0003-2157-5965; Robinson, Sharon/0000-0002-7130-9617; Clarke, Laurence/0000-0002-0844-4453; Turnbull, Johanna/0000-0002-4214-1675; Waterman, Melinda/0000-0001-5907-4512; Wasley, Jane/0000-0001-9379-664X; 													1758-678X	1758-6798				OCT	2018	8	10					879	+		10.1038/s41558-018-0280-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41558-018-0280-0													WOS:000445927700018

Fluctuating water levels control water chemistry and metabolism of a charophyte-dominated pond	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												To investigate seasonal variability and importance of environmental drivers of ecosystem metabolism in a shallow pond characterised by low and fluctuating water depth, clear water and shortage of nutrients, we measured primary production and respiration during May-September and examined their relationships to environmental parameters (light, temperature and pH). Using a combination of free water measurements of O2, pH, temperature and conductivity, in situ mesocosm and laboratory bottle experiments, we documented extreme daily variations in environmental variables (e.g. 0-700mmol O2m-3, pH 7.5-9.5, 18-32 degrees C) and high and variable areal rates of gross primary production (GPP, 30-316mmol O2m-2 day-1) and community respiration (R, 26-318mmol O2m-2 day-1). These rates of benthic charophytes under oligotrophic conditions are comparable to those obtained by pelagic phytoplankton communities under highly eutrophic conditions. By using sediment resources, benthic charophytes can achieve high biomasses and high metabolic rates. Pond metabolism reflected the physiology of the dominant charophyte, with light-saturated photosynthesis occurring during 55% of the light hours. Experiments and photosynthetic models showed inorganic carbon limitation of GPP at pHs above 9.5 during mid-summer periods of low water levels, while R was strongly influenced by temperature. According to open water measurements of O2, the pond was net autotrophic (mean NEP=12 +/- 13 (SD)mmol O2m-2 day-1) but net heterotrophic when based on dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) dynamics (10 +/- 29mmol CO2m-2 day-1), suggesting that the significant input of DIC in inflowing water from the surrounding limestone soils mimics elevated respiration.					; Staehr, Peter/J-3693-2013; Staehr, Peter Anton Upadhyay/S-6110-2018; Sand-Jensen, Kaj/F-3041-2015	Christensen, Jesper Philip Aagaard/0009-0008-7949-7465; Staehr, Peter Anton Upadhyay/0000-0002-1580-4875; Sand-Jensen, Kaj/0000-0003-2534-4638													0046-5070	1365-2427				JUL	2013	58	7					1353	1365		10.1111/fwb.12132	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12132													WOS:000319946000005

Specular reflection on Titan: Liquids in Kraken Mare	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												After more than 50 close flybys of Titan by the Cassini spacecraft, it has become evident that features similar in morphology to terrestrial lakes and seas exist in Titan's polar regions. As Titan progresses into northern spring, the much more numerous and larger lakes and seas in the north-polar region suggested by Cassini RADAR data, are becoming directly illuminated for the first time since the arrival of the Cassini spacecraft. This allows the Cassini optical instruments to search for specular reflections to provide further confirmation that liquids are present in these evident lakes. On July 8, 2009 Cassini VIMS detected a specular reflection in the north-polar region of Titan associated with Kraken Mare, one of Titan's large, presumed seas, indicating the lake's surface is smooth and free of scatterers with respect to the wavelength of 5 mm, where VIMS detected the specular signal, strongly suggesting it is liquid.

Plough pan formation underneath topsoil is a common feature of long-term paddy soils that significantly affects water movement and nutrient runoff loss, especially during the upland season of paddyupland rotation. To characterize the nutrients that are lost from wheat fields of paddy-wheat rotation with runoff, a field experiment was conducted in a wheat field using a simulated rainfall system from November 2019 to May 2020 in Nanjing, China. The aim of this study was to investigate the temporal characteristics of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loss under different rainfall intensities (low, 30 mm h-1; middle, 60 mm h-1; high, 90 mm h-1). The results showed that the time interval from the beginning of rain to the occurrence of runoff (time to runoff, Tr) was negatively correlated with "rainfall intensity" (Ri) (P<0.01) but unaffected by soil moisture. Different rainfall intensities had no effect on the runoff coefficient (the ratio of the runoff volume over the precipitation, 0.14-0.17). The N and P loss concentrations in the nutrient discharge followed a power-function relationship that decreased over time (P<0.01), and the peak nutrient concentration appeared during the initial runoff period (0-5 min). The N and P loss rates were the highest during the middle-to-late discharge period (15-30 min) for all intensities. In terms of cumulative nutrient losses, the amounts of TN lost were similar for all rainfall intensities, while TP significantly increased with intensity. The results revealed that nitrate-nitrogen (NOX- -N) and particulate phosphorus (PP) were the predominant forms of N and P losses. Overall, during the initial runoff period, nutrient concentration peaks, whereas the nutrient loss rate is the highest during the middle-late phase of the phenomenon.																			0269-7491	1873-6424				SEP 15	2021	285								117382	10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117382	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117382		MAY 2021						34049130					WOS:000685098800009

J	Morse, B; Hessami, M; Bourel, C				Morse, B; Hessami, M; Bourel, C			Characteristics of ice in the St. Lawrence River	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING												The main objective of this paper is to describe the characteristics of brash ice in the St. Lawrence River downstream of Montreal over a period of three winters. We used two instruments deployed in the St. Lawrence River navigation channel through Lake St. Pierre to measure ice parameters: an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) and an ice-profiling sonar (IPS). This paper discusses the capacities of these instruments to quantify ice characteristics and to predict the risk of ice congestion. It was found that wind velocity and air temperature play major roles in the variation in ice parameters and, consequently, in the occurrence of ice congestion in the navigation channel through Lake St. Pierre. Comparison of the IPS and ADCP data showed good agreement and demonstrated that these two instruments can be very effective for certain ice applications.

J	MOEN, V; LANGELAND, A				MOEN, V; LANGELAND, A			DIURNAL VERTICAL AND SEASONAL HORIZONTAL DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS OF MYSIS-RELICTA IN A LARGE NORWEGIAN LAKE	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Mysis relicta was sampled intensively along a depth profile in Lake Snasavatnet using benthic trawls and vertical net hauls. Samples were made around 12.00 and 24.00 h in May, June, August and September 1984. The light regime and temperature were also recorded. Mysis relicta showed a size-dependent diurnal vertical migration and seasonal benthic horizontal migration between shallow and deep areas. The young individuals left the marsupium in spring while the adults were staying benthic in shallow areas. As they grew in size the young individuals changed habitat, migrating into the pelagic zone and the deeper benthic areas. Mysis showed a bimodal vertical distribution pattern on our deepwater station, with one density peak in the water column and another along the bottom both day and night between May and September. The bimodal distribution pattern is discussed in relation to the light regime and an asynchronic vertical migration model. The density of Mysis was low in the pelagic zone compared to the shallow benthic area throughout the sampling period. Together with the difference in distribution pattern in the pelagic and benthic zones, this may influence the distribution pattern of salmonids which seek Mysis as a food item in Lake Snasavatnet.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				JUL	1989	11	4					729	745		10.1093/plankt/11.4.729	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/11.4.729													WOS:A1989AD91900007

J	Sidagyte, E; Arbaciauskas, K				Sidagyte, Egle; Arbaciauskas, Kestutis			Resistance to low oxygen in the Ponto-Caspian amphipod Pontogammarus robustoides varies among lentic habitats of its northern invaded range	LIMNOLOGICA												The Ponto-Caspian amphipod Pontogammarus robustoides was introduced into Lithuanian inland waters more than 50 years ago and is now among the most successful local crustacean invaders. Existing as an oxyphilic species in its native range, in Lithuania it managed to establish in some lentic eutrophic waters facing long-term hypoxic conditions under winter ice cover, or shorter periods of hypoxia during the warm season. Recently, it has been observed to be further expanding in such waters. The aim of this study was to explore the possible divergence in anaerobic metabolism among introduced populations facing different selective pressures. A closed-bottle experiment was conducted using individuals from three Lithuanian lentic water bodies of different trophic status: mesotrophic, eutrophic and hypertrophic. Severe hypoxia was gradually reached, after which lactate dehydrogenase activity was significantly higher in amphipods from eutrophic and hypertrophic, than from mesotrophic environments, and was well correlated with trophic status of inhabited environments as assessed by chlorophyll a concentration. These findings suggest a physiological acclimation response to oxygen deficiency faced by the species in some environments in the northern invaded range, which may have a genetic background. Such resistance to oxygen deficiency may expand the environmental niche and promote species' spread into previously unsuitable habitats, which may pose a threat to native species residing in refuges that are currently free of the invader.

High-resolution water column survey to identify active sublacustrine hydrothermal discharge zones within Lake Rotomahana, North Island, New Zealand	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Autonomous underwater vehicles were used to conduct a high-resolution water column survey of Lake Rotomahana using temperature, pH, turbidity, and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) to identify active hydro thermal discharge zones within the lake. Five areas with active sublacustrine venting were identified: (1) the area of the historic Pink Terraces; (2) adjacent to the western shoreline subaerial "Steaming Cliffs," boiling springs and geyser; (3) along the northern shoreline to the east of the Pink Terrace site; (4) the newly discovered Patiti hydrothermal system along the south margin of the 1886 Tarawera eruption rift zone; and (5) a location in the east basin (northeast of Patiti Island). The Pink Terrace hydrothermal system was active prior to the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera, but venting along the western shoreline, in the east basin, and the Patiti hydrothermal system appear to have been initiated in the aftermath of the eruption, similar to Waimangu Valley to the southwest. Different combinations of turbidity, pH anomalies (both positive and negative), and ORP responses suggest vent fluid compositions vary over short distances within the lake. The seasonal period of stratification limits vertical transport of heat to the surface layer and the hypolimnion temperature of Lake Rotomahana consequently increases with an average warming rate of similar to 0.010 degrees C/day due to both convective hydrothermal discharge and conductive geothermal heating. A sudden temperature increase occurred during our 2011 survey and was likely the response to an earthquake swarm just 11 days prior.

J	Thibodeau, B; Hélie, JF; Lehmann, MF				Thibodeau, Benoit; Helie, Jean-Francois; Lehmann, Moritz F.			Variations of the nitrate isotopic composition in the St. Lawrence River caused by seasonal changes in atmospheric nitrogen inputs	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												We present 42 dual-isotope nitrate analyses of fresh water samples collected in the St. Lawrence River between June 2006 and July 2008. Measured delta N-15-NO3 (-) and delta O-18-NO3 (-) values correlate negatively, while delta O-18-NO3 (-) displays no negative correlation with nitrate concentration. This suggests that nitrate uptake and/or elimination by denitrification is not the main driver of observed variations in nitrate concentration and isotopic signature in the St. Lawrence River. In addition, delta O-18-NO3 (-) is negatively correlated with the seasonally variable delta O-18 of ambient water, indicating that the variation in the isotopic signature of nitrate is barely modulated by in-stream nitrate regeneration (nitrification). It rather is constrained by along-river changes in the external sources of nitrate. Given the distinct nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) isotopic signature of atmospheric nitrate, we argue that observed seasonal variations of delta N-15-NO3 (-) and delta O-18-NO3 (-) in the St. Lawrence River are due to variable contributions of snowmelt-derived water. Based on a N and O isotope mass balance, we show that total nitrate loading in the St. Lawrence River is dominated by a N input from the Great Lakes (47 +/- A 28 %) and from nitrate regeneration of both internal and external N (48 +/- A 22 %). While temporal nitrate N and O isotope dynamics in the St. Lawrence River are mainly influenced by the atmospheric N input fluctuations, with an increase in atmospheric loading during spring, atmospheric N plays overall a rather insignificant role with regards to the N budget (5 +/- A 4 %).

J	De Leeuw, JJ				De Leeuw, JJ			Food intake rates and habitat segregation of tufted duck Aythya fuligula and scaup Aythya marila exploiting zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha	ARDEA												The foraging skills of Tufted Duck Aythya fuligula and Scaup Aythya marila feeding on Zebra Mussels Dreissena polymorpha were studied in experiments under seminatural diving conditions with relevance to the IJssalmeer/Markermeer area (large lakes in the centre of The Netherlands, former Zuiderzee area), the major freshwater wintering site of both species in Europe. Daily consumption of mussels (based on fresh mass) was about two to three times the body mass of the birds because of the large water and shell content and consequently low nutritional value of mussels. Feeding costs (diving and processing food) were about 50% of daily energy expenses in winter, as revealed from doubly labelled water measurements. Food intake rates decreased with the degree of byssal thread attachment of mussels in Tufted Duck, while intake rates of Scaup were only affected when mussels grew in tightly attached clumps. Food intake rates were usually 15-25% lower in Tufted Duck than in the 25% heavier Scaup. Both species were able to swallow all mussels available in the population, though smaller mussels were slightly favoured. Scaup had higher food intake rates at low mussel densities than Tufted Duck, but intake rates seemed unaffected at densities higher than ca. 100 gFM m(-2), which is similar to giving-up densities observed in the field. Feeding activity consisted of short feeding bouts of a number of dives in quick succession to fill the esophagus with mussels, followed by longer resting pauses of 5-10 minutes to crush mussel shells in the gizzard and digest the flesh. The limited capacity to store food in the gut (less than 5% of the daily requirement) and long digestive pauses imply that diving ducks must spend a large fraction of the day on the feeding grounds. The differences in feeding skills between the two species correspond qualitatively with their spatial segregation in the IJsselmeer area when local differences in prey properties are taken into account.																			0373-2266	2213-1175					1999	87	1					15	31																WOS:000083232300002

Herein, a nano-gradient-structured nanofiltration membrane was fabricated, in which PEI with different molecular weights and TMC were utilized in a gradient interfacial polymerization process to construct the target active layer. Via this facile strategy, the grafting density of PEI and the amino group introduced were properly adjusted, and the pore size distribution and surface charge of the active layer were optimized. The fabricated active layer simultaneously possesses sub-nanometer pore size with a modified gradient structure and high interfacial positive charges, which can accurately screen lithium and magnesium. The successful grafting of secondary PEI and the high positive charge and continuity of the active layer have been demonstrated. After 150 hour operation (Mg/Li ratio of 50), PEI-70000/ PA/PES nanofiltration membrane achieved a lithium-magnesium separation factor (SLi/Mg) as high as 150 while maintaining the stable permeation flux of approximately 20 L center dot m(-2)center dot h(-1)center dot MPa-1, and the terminal Mg/Li ratio on the permeable side falls to 0.32, which exhibits significant potential for extracting Li from salt lake brines with high Mg/Li ratio with promising long-term stability.

From 1997 to 2001, the fish communities shifted from the dominance of large cyprinids to an explosion of small cyprinids and a higher proportion of piscivores in effectively biomanipulated lakes (> 200 kg ha(-1) 3 yr(-1)). The biomass of cyanobacteria decreased, and the duration of the blooms shortened and shifted towards the autumn. Decreased concentrations and slower cycling of nutrients and increased grazing by cladocerans probably affected the declined biomass of cyanobacteria. Less intensive sediment disturbance and increased phosphorus-retention in fast growing fish biomass may have turned the role of the fish assemblage from 'nutrient recycler' to 'nutrient storage'. Increased potential grazing pressure, higher proportion of edible algae, and lower chlorophyll a: total phosphorus ratio indicated strengthened herbivore control. A high mass removal catch in relation to trophic state, low background turbidity, and bearable external loading favoured the successful biomanipulation, whereas intensive cyprinid reproduction, high nutrient loading and non-algal turbidity hindered the recovery. Three important issues should be noticed before biomanipulation in Finland: (1) careful selection of target lake, (2) well-planned, effective and long-lasting biomanipulation and (3) sustainable management of piscivores.

Sediment resuspension mechanisms and their contributions to high-turbidity events in a large lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												High-resolution field data, collected during April to October of 2008-2009, were analyzed to investigate the quantitative contribution of sediment resuspension to high-turbidity events in central Lake Erie. Resuspension events were distinguished within high-turbidity events according to turbidity, fluorescence and acoustic backscatter timeseries, as well as satellite images. We observed 16 high-turbidity events, causing a total duration of similar to 20 d (out of 344 d) with elevated nearbed turbidity (> 10 NTU). Of these events, 64% were correlated with algal biomass, with the remaining 18%, 5%, and 4% being attributed to sediment resuspension by surface waves, storm-generated currents and enhanced nearbed turbulence induced by high-frequency internal waves, respectively. This is the first time that resuspension by enhanced nearbed turbulence from high-frequency linear internal wave degeneration has been observed in a large lake. Resuspension was parameterized as a function of the instantaneous critical bottom velocity, bottom shear stress and the Shields parameter. From the in situ measurements, we suggest an extended Shields diagram for silty bed material that can be used to predict resuspension in other aquatic systems with similar sediment composition (similar to 20% cohesive sediment).					; Valipour, Reza/AAZ-7695-2020	Bouffard, Damien/0000-0002-2005-9718; Valipour, Reza/0000-0001-7456-5213													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	2017	62	3					1045	1065		10.1002/lno.10485	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10485													WOS:000402907100012

This lake is located in mid-latitude cold and dry climate zone. We categorized the ice season into growth, equilibrium, and melting stages. The thickness of ice increased by an average of 0.7 cm day(-1) at the bottom of the ice during the growth stage, and during the equilibrium stage it was stable at 35.0 +/- 0.5 cm. During the melting stage, the internal melting dominated the ice ablation (1.0 cm day(-1)), followed by bottom melting (0.45 cm day(-1)) and surface melting (0.25 cm day(-1)). The net short-wave and long-wave radiative fluxes dominated the heat budget throughout the seasonal cycle. Sublimation was 1.1 cm, 73% of that in the growth stage. During the melting stage, the absorbed short-wave radiative flux promoted internal melting, enlarged the porosity, and enhanced further surface melting. The frequent negative air temperature during nighttime hindered the phase changes of the lake ice surface layer. In addition, the upward sensible heat flux in the lake water body increased from 7.8 to 14.5 W m(-2) due to the increased light transmittance by lake ice. The heat balance and heat fluxes in ice-covered lakes in mid-latitude dry climate have rarely been explored. The results increase the knowledge of lake ice geophysics and are also useful for calibration and validation of lake ice models.

Multibeam bathymetry, sub bottom profiler data and samples were acquired to allow morphological interpretations of the processes leading to the mass movements. The underwater slopes of the lake generally show gradients of 15-20 degrees, but exceed 30 degrees in places. The sediment thickness above acoustic basement interpreted from sub bottom profiler data show that the accumulation rate in the central lake basin is about 2 mm/year. Numerous channels are seen on the bathymetry as well as several slide scarps that are about 2 m high. The channels are interpreted to be caused by dense water cascading, probably induced by winter cooling. Calculations based on geotechnical tests of samples indicate that sediment layers in excess of 2 m have a factor of safety less than 1.5 on slopes above 30 degrees. Triggering of slides may thus be spontaneous due to sedimentation, but may also be triggered by oversteepening due to erosional channeling.																					978-3-319-20979-1				2016	41						191	199		10.1007/978-3-319-20979-1_19	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-20979-1_19													WOS:000381724100019

Distribution and abundance of killer whales (Orcinus orca) in Nunavut, Canada-an Inuit knowledge survey	JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM												Traditional ecological knowledge is being increasingly used in wildlife management in northern regions, and Inuit harvesters in Nunavut, Canada, have extensive knowledge about local wildlife species. We collected Inuit knowledge on killer whales (Orcinus orca) through 105 semi-directed interviews in 11 Nunavut communities from 2007 to 2010. Interviewees provided extensive information on killer whale movements, seasonal presence, distribution and abundance in the eastern Canadian Arctic. Observations from different communities were often complementary, and there was consistency in interview comments both within and among regions. Nearly all participants had seen killer whales at least once, and the whales were present every summer (July-September) in all regions, although movements depended on ice conditions. Relative abundance of killer whales varied by region, and they were reported more often in North Baffin communities than in other regions. Killer whales migrated through Hudson Strait and Lancaster Sound following their marine mammal prey. Estimates of local population sizes were variable, with suggested numbers that varied from tens to the low hundreds. Most interviewees in the Foxe Basin, Hudson Bay and north Baffin regions thought that killer whale presence was increasing. In contrast, half the South Baffin interviewees noted declines in past abundance due to the 1977 harvest of 14 whales that became trapped in a saltwater lake. Interviews provided information at a long temporal and wide spatial record. Inuit are reliable observers and continued killer whale research will be most effective if it integrates modern science approaches with the traditional skills, knowledge and experience of Inuit harvesters.																			0025-3154	1469-7769				SEP	2014	94	6					1293	1304		10.1017/S0025315413000921	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0025315413000921													WOS:000342216600026
J	Sell, AF				Sell, Anne F.			Atrophic cascade with Chaoborus:: population dynamics of ex-ephippial generations of Daphnia	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Changes in population dynamics and competitive outcome between Daphnia pulex and D. rosea in response to severe predation by Chaoborus larvae were investigated in a field experiment. In a nearly fishless lake with unusually high densities of Chaoborus flavicans and C. obscuripes, the two coexisting Daphnia species developed morphological defense structures to a different degree. An enclosure-exclosure setup was applied to investigate the population dynamics of both species in presence and absence of the predators. The field study followed the population growth of freshly hatched juveniles of D. pulex and D. rosea as they naturally emerged from ephippia in the lake's sediment during spring. Both Daphnia species have a large body size and, in enclosures with Chaoborus only, developed neckteeth and elongated tail spines as inducible defenses. Nevertheless, Chaoborus accounted for high mortality rates in ephippial neonates and strongly reduced the chance of individuals to reach maturity, especially in D. rosea, the dominant species in enclosures without Chaoborus. It is concluded that, in the first generation, when otherwise large and morphologically defended Daphnia are synchronized by ephippial origin to a population of only juveniles, atrophic cascade with Chaoborus may become highly effective.

However, their ephemeral nature makes it challenging to document ARs in climate models and estimate their contribution to hydroclimate changes recorded by time-averaged paleoclimate archives. We present new climate model simulations of Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1; 16,000 years before the present), an interval characterized by widespread wetness in the western US, that demonstrate increased AR frequency and winter precipitation sourced from the southeastern North Pacific. These changes are amplified with freshwater fluxes into the North Atlantic, indicating that North Atlantic cooling associated with weakened Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a key driver of HS1 climate in this region. As recent observations suggest potential weakening of AMOC, our identified connection between North Atlantic climate and northeast Pacific AR activity has implications for future western US hydroclimate.

Our results show that the three Triassic formations from bottom to top (Locker Shale, Mungaroo Formation and Brigadier Formation) comprise a complete depositional cycle and correspond to an undeveloped, strong, and weak monsoon periods, respectively. During the strong monsoon period of the Mungaroo Formation, the palynological evidences exhibited mixture spore-pollen characteristics of the hygrophytic assemblage (spore-pollen from the pterido-phyte spores, seed ferns and cycads pollen in humid environment of lowlands and coastal plain) and the xerophytic assemblage (pollen from the drought tolerant plants of the interior mountainous areas). The sedimentary evidences of the Mungaroo Formation show low-angle shingled progradational seismic reflection configuration. The highly seasonal variations in precipitation during deposition of the Mungaroo Formation exhibited typical "sandwiched" depositional characteristics of coarse channels sandstone (fining-upward fluvial aggradational cycles (FACs) with poor to moderately sorting and angular to subangular roundness), organic mudstone and coal seam interbedded. Finally, in contrast to today's typical examples of Poyang Lake Delta, a shallow-water braided delta conceptual depositional model of the Mungaroo Formation is formed with a large proximal and distal delta plain, and small delta front. The model results serve mainly to indicate the importance of various climate-forming factors (climate, topography, eustatic), whereas tectonic activity unlikely played any significant role in this process.

Results indicate that drought prone areas and sites exposed to domestic or municipal wastes are most heavily polluted. Major water problems are due to fecal and non-fecal contamination, high TDS, conductivity and salt content. The well waters were moderately poor in quality as compared to the hand pump water sources, which exhibited more metal and salt enrichments. Remote sites viz, springs and lakes, however, exhibited a better water quality in terms of optimum physico-chemical parameters and comparatively lesser fecal and non-fecal contamination. Use of water for drinking or agricultural purposes from such wells and hand pumps without treatment may expose population to higher health risk.																			0972-9860	1875-8568					2005	2	2					81	87																WOS:000211137700013

This study used (i) regressions to adjust weather records for local conditions, (ii) climate-driven simulation models to simulate soil moisture and temperatures, and (iii) site-specific regression models to reconstruct ion concentrations in soil solution for the past 40 years. A standardized tree-ring index was used to measure tree radial growth. The study site was a sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) dominated deciduous stand in Ontario (Turkey Lakes). Based on reconstructed data, when only climate factors were used, 63% of the year-to-year variation in growth index was explained by (i) precipitation during the growing season, and (ii) air temperatures in midwinter, during the growing season, and prior to autumnal leaf fall. The proportion of explained variance was raised to 83% when (i) precipitation was replaced with soil water content, and (ii) soil solution nitrate concentrations in August and in the preceding recuperating season were incorporated. Hence, introducing transient soil properties into tree-ring based growth analysis may substantially reduce error variance; climatic effects on tree growth depend largely on specific, season-dependent responses of transient soil properties.

Among these, 68 were able to grow in the presence of 1.5 M NaCl and 52 demonstrated the ability to grow in the selection medium containing 3.5 M NaCl. None of the isolates appeared to produce appreciable amounts of extracellular L-asparaginase. Among the isolates that produced intracellular L-asparaginase, 5 moderate and 1 extreme halophiles were selected for further study based on their observed activity level. The moderately halophilic isolates were shown to belong to the genus Halomonas while the extreme halophile was identified as a member of the genus Aidingimonas.

Paleoindians, paleolakes and paleoplayas: Landscape geoarchaeology of the Tularosa Basin, New Mexico	GEOMORPHOLOGY					Annual Meeting of the American-Association-of-Geographers	2017	Boston, MA	Amer Assoc Geographers				Karl Butzer was one of the first prehistorians to think about and write about people, ancient and modern, on the landscape. Moreover, as a geomorphologist he knew that past landscapes were as dynamic and varied as they are today - not static entities that formed the backdrop for human activity. That viewpoint is critical in understanding the physical environment faced by humans during the early peopling of the Americas (similar to 13,500 to similar to 10,000 cal YBP). North America was undergoing rapid environmental changes as the continent was coming out of the last Ice Age. In the southwestern part of the continent large paleolake levels were falling and smaller playa basins were aggrading as the area was occupied by Paleoindian groups such as Clovis, Folsom, and later First Americans. The paleolakes would have provided some resources, but modern gypsum deposits indicate that lake waters were unpotable. Numerous small depressions (playas) scattered around the floor of the Tularosa Basin contain muddy fills that span the Holocene and terminal Pleistocene, indicative of fresher water at least seasonally. Paleoindian sites tend to be clustered around these small basins and along drainages off of the mountains that flank the basin, as well as settings with good viewsheds rather than the main paleolake margins. Paleolakes were dramatic components of the late Pleistocene landscape in the southwest, but likely were not the primary attractions to the First Americans. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Summertime surface O3 behavior and deposition to tundra in the Alaskan Arctic	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Atmospheric turbulence quantities, boundary layer ozone (O-3) levels, and O-3 deposition to the tundra surface were investigated at Toolik Lake, AK, during the 2011 summer season. Beginning immediately after snowmelt, a diurnal cycle of O-3 in the atmospheric surface layer developed with daytime O-3 maxima, and minima during low-light hours, resulting in a mean amplitude of 13ppbv. This diurnal O-3 cycle is far larger than observed at other high Arctic locations during the snow-free season. During the snow-free months of June, July, and August, O-3 deposition velocities were approximate to 3 to 5 times faster than during May, when snow covered the ground most of the month. The overall mean O-3 deposition velocity between June and August was 0.10cms(-1). The month of June had the highest diurnal variation, with a median O-3 deposition velocity of 0.2cms(-1) during the daytime and 0.08cms(-1) during low-light conditions. These values are slightly lower than previously reported summertime deposition velocities in northern latitudes over tundra or fen. O-3 loss during low-light periods was attributed to a combination of surface deposition to the tundra and stable boundary layer conditions. We also hypothesize that emissions of reactive biogenic volatile organic compounds into the shallow boundary layer may contribute to nighttime O-3 loss.

MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY												The American mink Neovison vison is an invasive carnivore which may significantly affect populations of the water vole Arvicola amphibius. However, its impact on this rodent species depends on the abundance, dispersion and configuration of the habitats suitable for water voles and their accessibility for the mink. Using live-trapping, we studied the water vole and American mink populations inhabiting midfield ponds located in the vicinity of a large lake. In the same area, the mink diet was described after collecting and analysing scats. During four spring seasons, the water vole density gradually increased and no population peaks or crashes were observed. The maximum recorded density was 9.0 individuals/1 km of pond shoreline. Water voles displayed high year-to-year population turnover: less than 5% of the marked individuals were recaptured in the following year. In April-July, the exchange of individuals in the population during one-month periods was also high and usually exceeded 50%. Water vole remains were found in mink scats in all seasons, and the highest overall percentage biomass of water vole in mink diet for a two-months period reached 52.2% in May-June 2012. The results of our study show that at small water bodies adjacent to a large lake, the water vole population may withstand the impact of the invasive American mink.

J	Elarabany, N				Elarabany, Naglaa			A comparative study of some haematological and biochemical parameters between two species from the Anatidae family within migration season	JOURNAL OF BASIC AND APPLIED ZOOLOGY												Background: The study of haematological and biochemical parameters is important to evaluate the physiological status in wild birds. In order to carry out ecophysiological or conservation studies, it is important to know the baseline physiological parameters and how these vary with age, sex and life history events. Results: Haematological parameters including red blood corpuscles (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), haematocrit, haemoglobin and related RBC indices and plasma and biochemical parameters including glucose, lipid profile and liver function tests, kidney function tests and electrolyte concentration reference values were determined in two long-distance migratory species from the family Anatidae, the northern shoveler (Anas clypeata) and Eurasian teal (Anas crecca), during migration season. Data revealed significant inter-species differences for most blood and biochemical parameters. These differences are likely due to different feeding habit, diet and species-specific migration behaviour rather than phylogenetic reasons or different environmental condition as they winter at the same place (Matiez et al., Conservation Monitoring in Freshwater Habitats, 2010). Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study that performs a comparative blood analysis on northern shoveler and Eurasian teal during their overwintering period in Manzala Lake, Egypt. Due to the lack of haematological studies on both species during migration, the current results represent a contribution to understanding the physiological adaptations that facilitate the use of different habitats in these species and for establishing reference physiological values and for comparison within the same species, or even with other species in different periods with regard to their use in future conservation efforts or other studies.

There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in deposition rates between sites on Narrow Lake, on the lake shore, and on land 18 km away. Deposition of TP, but not TN, followed a distinct pattern during the open-water season; TP was highest just after ice-off (May) and decreased throughout the remainder of the open-water season. Deposition during the winter accounted for only 4 and 12% of the annual TP and TN loads, respectively. Dry fallout contributed 50 and 33% of atmospheric deposition of TP and TN, respectively. In both dry and wet fallout, dissolved P (< 0.45 .mu.m) and organic N were the predominant fractions of TP and TN, respectively. During July 1986, unusually heavy rainfalls caused an increase in TP, but not TN, concentrations in the epilimnion of Narrow Lake. Wet fallout accounted for only 9% of the observed increase of epilimnetic TP; the rest was from surface runoff from the drainage basin. The design of sampling programs to measure atmospheric deposition of nutrients to lakes is discussed.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				JAN	1989	43	1-2					119	134		10.1007/BF00175588	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00175588													WOS:A1989U751600011

J	Huo, F; Li, YP; Li, ZH				Huo, Fei; Li, Yanping; Li, Zhenhua			High-latitude lake influence on highly concentrated precipitation from cold-season storms in western Canada	WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES												Cold-season (October-March) storms, particularly severe snowstorms, are responsible for significant economic losses and have crucial impacts on freshwater availability and ecosystems in high-latitude North America. These snowstorms also contribute to destructive floods during rapid snowmelt. Thus, ecosystems and water infrastructure in Canada are highly sensitive to changes in cold-season storms under global warming. This study employs an object-based approach, specifically utilizing a storm-tracking algorithm, to investigate how cold-season storm precipitation in western Canada responds to climate change under a worst-case warming scenario. In the entire study area, peak daily precipitation greater than 50 mm day(-1) within storms significantly increases in both warm and cold seasons. The most extreme storms with highly concentrated precipitation (that is, storms with the precipitation intensity 5 times greater at the storm center compared to the area-averaged intensity), are expected to become more frequent in the future, particularly in the coastal regions and inland lake regions. More importantly, by analyzing the top 20 storms with the highest peak daily precipitation, we found that in the future, lakes will contribute more moisture to the atmosphere through increased evaporation, thereby intensifying the moisture supply and enhancing storm precipitation. Additionally, our findings indicate that future cold-season storms with highly concentrated precipitation may not increase evenly across each month. Warmer lakes in autumn, due to their high thermal inertia, will continue to provide significant local moisture to the atmosphere, which is crucial for the formation of highly concentrated precipitation. These findings suggest significant implications for understanding and predicting the impacts of climate change on storm dynamics and precipitation patterns over inland lakes.

J	Charvet, S; Vincent, WF; Lovejoy, C				Charvet, Sophie; Vincent, Warwick F.; Lovejoy, Connie			Chrysophytes and other protists in High Arctic lakes: molecular gene surveys, pigment signatures and microscopy	POLAR BIOLOGY												Microscopic analysis of the phytoplankton and other protist communities in High Arctic lakes has shown that they often contain taxa in the Chrysophyceae. Such studies have been increasingly supported by pigment analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to identify the major algal groups. However, the use of 18S rRNA gene surveys in other systems indicates that many protists, especially small heterotrophs, are underreported or missed by microscopy and HPLC. Here, we investigated the late summer protist community structure of three contrasting lakes in High Arctic polar desert catchments (Char Lake at 74A degrees 42' N, Lake A at 83A degrees 00' N and Ward Hunt Lake at 83A degrees 05' N) with a combination of microscopy, pigment analysis and small subunit 18S ribosomal RNA gene surveys. All three methods showed that chrysophytes were well represented, accounting for 50-70% of total protist community biomass and 25-50% of total 18S rRNA gene sequences. HPLC analysis supported these observations by showing the ubiquitous presence of chrysophyte pigments. The clone libraries revealed a greater contribution of heterotrophs to the protist communities than suggested by microscopy. The flagellate Telonema and ciliates were common in all three lakes, and one fungal sequence was recovered from Char Lake. The approaches yielded complementary information about the protist community structure in the three lakes and underscored the importance of chrysophytes, suggesting that they are well adapted to cope with the low nutrient supply and strong seasonality that characterize the High Arctic environment.

David			Reduced arctic tundra productivity linked with landform and climate change interactions	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Arctic tundra ecosystems have experienced unprecedented change associated with climate warming over recent decades. Across the Pan-Arctic, vegetation productivity and surface greenness have trended positively over the period of satellite observation. However, since 2011 these trends have slowed considerably, showing signs of browning in many regions. It is unclear what factors are driving this change and which regions/landforms will be most sensitive to future browning. Here we provide evidence linking decadal patterns in arctic greening and browning with regional climate change and local permafrost-driven landscape heterogeneity. We analyzed the spatial variability of decadal-scale trends in surface greenness across the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska (similar to 60,000 km(2)) using the Landsat archive (1999-2014), in combination with novel 30 m classifications of polygonal tundra and regional watersheds, finding landscape heterogeneity and regional climate change to be the most important factors controlling historical greenness trends. Browning was linked to increased temperature and precipitation, with the exception of young landforms (developed following lake drainage), which will likely continue to green. Spatiotemporal model forecasting suggests carbon uptake potential to be reduced in response to warmer and/or wetter climatic conditions, potentially increasing the net loss of carbon to the atmosphere, at a greater degree than previously expected.					; Lara, Mark/I-6049-2019; Grosse, Guido/F-5018-2011	Nitze, Ingmar/0000-0002-1165-6852; Grosse, Guido/0000-0001-5895-2141; Lara, Mark/0000-0002-4670-7031													2045-2322					FEB 5	2018	8								2345	10.1038/s41598-018-20692-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-20692-8								29402988					WOS:000424087700017
J	Burke, CM; Knott, B				Burke, CM; Knott, B			Homeostatic interactions between the benthic microbial communities and the waters of a hypersaline lake, Lake Hayward, western Australia	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												In hypersaline Lake Hayward, photosynthesis by benthic microbial communities (BMCs) is normally sufficient to supersaturate the bottom water with dissolved oxygen during periods of stratification. The BMCs are dominated by cyanobacteria such as Cyanothece in the permanently inundated centre of the lake and by Microcoleus in the seasonally desiccated littoral. However, after an unusually dry year in 1987, the salinity increased to 260 g L-1 and gypsum precipitated throughout the lake. The turbidity generated was sufficient to obscure the benthos completely despite the shallowness of the lake (<2 m). As a result, the BMCs were greatly altered and the amount of oxygenic photosynthesis was reduced. During the following winter (1988), during stratification the bottom water became anoxic and sulfurous. However, during the next few years the BMCs reestablished and were able to again supersaturate the bottom water with oxygen. Limnological and microbiological changes that occurred in this period are described and it is concluded that the BMCs function as a strong homeostatic mechanism allowing long-term stability of the present limnological characteristics of Lake Hayward. Therefore, the development of the BMCs represented a significant step in the ontogeny of the lake, which now differs distinctly from nearby lakes that do not contain such BMCs.																			1323-1650	1448-6059					1997	48	7					623	631		10.1071/MF96102	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF96102													WOS:000071752800010
J	BAKER, FC				BAKER, FC			LITTORAL MACROPHYTE VEGETATION OF SOUTHEASTERN DEVILS LAKE	TRANSACTIONS OF THE WISCONSIN ACADEMY SCIENCES ARTS AND LETTERS												With the exception of Potamogeton robbinsii and P. confervoides, there are apparently few distinct relationships in the total community of SE Devil''s Lake [Wisconsin, USA]. Environmentally, water depth seems to be the major factor in controlling the vegetative growth in the littoral zone. Bottom sediment could play a part in limiting the vegetative growth below the depth of 6 m, but at lesser depths it has little effect. Because of the relatively small size of the area sampled and the pronounced differences in the lake floor terrain, research is needed in other areas of the lake on the vegetation as a whole. The Kashawago Springs and surrounding area, the NE, and the NW portions of the lake would be of particular interest for such research.																									1975	63						66	71																WOS:A1975BK80100005

Prediction of Lake-Effect Snow Using Convection-Allowing Ensemble Forecasts and Regional Data Assimilation	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												Lake-effect snow (LES) is a cold-season mesoscale convective phenomenon that can lead to significant snowfall rates and accumulations in the Great Lakes region of the United States. While limited-area numerical weather prediction models have shown skill in prediction of warm-season convective storms, forecasting the sharp nature of LES precipitation timing, intensity, and location is difficult because of model error and initial and boundary condition uncertainties. Ensemble forecasting can incorporate and quantify some sources of forecast error, but ensemble design must be considered. This study examines the relative contributions of forecast uncertainties to LES forecast error using a regional convection-allowing data assimilation and ensemble prediction system. Ensembles are developed using various methods of perturbations to simulate a long-lived and high-precipitation LES event in December 2013, and forecast performance is evaluated using observations including those from the Ontario Winter Lake-Effect Systems (OWLeS) campaign. Model lateral boundary conditions corresponding to weather conditions beyond the Great Lakes region play an influential role in LES precipitation forecasts and their uncertainty, as evidenced by ensemble spread, particularly at lead times beyond one day. Astrong forecast dependence on regional initial conditions was shown using data assimilation. This sensitivity impacts the timing and intensity of predicted precipitation, as well as band location and orientation assessed with an object-based verification approach, giving insight into the time scales of practical predictability of LES. Overall, an assimilation-cycling convection-allowing ensemble prediction system could improve future lake-effect snow precipitation forecasts and analyses and can help quantify and understand sources of forecast uncertainty.																			0882-8156	1520-0434				OCT	2017	32	5					1727	1744		10.1175/WAF-D-16-0206.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/WAF-D-16-0206.1													WOS:000417409700003

To supplement the top-down management, a new type of water treatment technology was tested during two seasons (May-August 1996/1997), aiming at the bottom-up control of mass developments of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa. The technology is based on a combined lake-internal phosphorus precipitation and a transport of hypolimnetic water rich in free carbon dioxide into the upper layers. During the treatment periods, there were found both an increase of CO2 concentrations in the mixed layer and an extension of the period in which free CO2 was detected in the epilimnion. The concentrations of phosphorus could be lowered drastically in the whole water body. Microcystis was almost totally suppressed (1996) or appeared with a delay (1997) compared to the regular annual pattern observed before the treatment. In contrast to the preceding year (1995), diatoms played a major role in the summer phytoplankton during the treatment years (1996/1997). The two application periods are compared with respect to the influence of meteorologically determined variables.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1999	408						31	38		10.1023/A:1017097502883	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017097502883													WOS:000084892400004

The lower density cohort exhibited typical ontogenetic spatial behaviour patterns consisting of an early pelagic phase followed by a complete migration to the littoral zone by midsummer. The high-density cohort appeared to split into a faster growing littoral component and a slower growing pelagic component which persisted throughout the growing season and into the next spring. The differences in spatial behaviour between these two cohorts could not be explained by spatial patterns in prey availability. The overwinter mortality rate for the high-density cohort was approximately double that observed for the low-density cohort. No direct observations of behaviour were made of the two cohorts, but distribution and growth data, along with arguments from competition theory, support the hypothesis that interference competition is the density-dependent mechanism responsible for the aberrant ontogeny of spatial distribution of the high-density cohort. The occurrence of interference competition in which competitively superior individuals can monopolize optimal habitats, relegating other individuals to suboptimal habitats, infers an asymptotic stock and recruitment relationship.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				APR	1997	54	4					867	875		10.1139/cjfas-54-4-867	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-54-4-867													WOS:A1997XA82600015

We test this correlation using U-Pb chemical abrasion-isotope dilution-thermal ionization mass spectrometry (CA-ID-TIMS) on detrital zircon grains from basal units within these successions. ChUMP units yield CA-ID-TIMS maximum depositional ages (MDA) between 775 and 766 Ma: the Chuar Group of AZ has an MDA of 770.1 +/- 0.5 Ma (n = 1) and an additional young zircon mode at 775.7 +/- 0.3 Ma (n = 11); the Uinta Mountain Group of northern UT has an MDA of 766.3 +/- 0.5 Ma (n = 5) and contains a second young mode at 775.1 +/- 0.7 Ma (n = 3); and the basal Horse Thief Springs Formation of the middle Pahrump Group CA has an MDA of 775.4 +/- 0.7 Ma (n = 3). The ca. 775 and 770 Ma grains are interpreted to be from zircon-bearing mafic sources related to the 770-778 Ma Gunbarrel Large Igneous Province of Yukon and NW U.S.A. The 766 Ma population was either derived from the Mt Rogers complex of eastern Laurentia or could have come from conjugate margins that were in the process of rifting away, such as Tasmania. The CA-ID-TIMS dates on the Chuar Group in Grand Canyon anchor a Bayesian age model for evaluating late Tonian Earth systems. Faster sediment accumulation rates (80 + 150/-44 m/My) in the lower Chuar Group are consistent with the inception of an extensional basin related to Rodinia breakup; slower rates in the upper Chuar Group (25 + 12/-5 m/My) record are associated with relatively deeper water sedimentation and concomitant organic carbon burial during marine transgression. The model also constrains the timing of several biological events recorded in the Chuar Group, including eukaryovorous predation (>767 Ma), the first appearance of vaseshaped microfossils (similar to 741 Ma), and the ranges of Cerebrosphaera globosa (=C. buickii; 800-743 Ma) and Lanu-latisphaera laufeldii. (766-740 Ma), both proposed as possible marine index fossils for late Tonian time. Finally, the model can also be used to search for stratigraphic evidence of a purported glaciation at ca. 751 Ma.

Biotic and thermal drivers alter zooplankton phenology in western Lake Erie	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												Environmental change, particularly warming and eutrophication, can alter phenology in aquatic systems. Understanding controls on zooplankton phenology is important due to their central role in food webs. While patterns in zooplankton phenology have been well documented, we lack an understanding of how abiotic and biotic drivers influence lake zooplankton phenology during the summer. We examined the phenology of four common zooplankton taxa (Daphnia retrocurva, Skistodiaptomus oregonensis, Mesocyclops spp., Dreissenid veligers) in western Lake Erie during 1995-2022, a period with increasing eutrophication and Bythotrephes longimanus biomass. Many phenology metrics varied by 3 weeks or more from 1995 to 2022. The dominant controls of phenology were temperature and biotic factors, especially grazer-defended phytoplankton (cyanobacteria and other colonial or filamentous taxa) and the invasive predator B. longimanus, which frequently interacted. Our results show that aspects of environmental change interact to shape zooplankton phenology, which can influence phytoplankton biomass and energy flow to higher trophic levels.

A two-year monthly monitoring of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope ratios (delta H-2 and delta O-18) in a temperate catchment in Norther Europa, Latvia was undertaken. Isotope ratios in common water types - raised bog, confined groundwater, unconfined groundwater and surface water - were measured. We found characteristic signatures of isotope ratios for each of these four water types. The average isotope ratios of different water types ranged from -80.8 to -68.3 parts per thousand for delta H-2 and -11.46 to -8.76 parts per thousand for delta O-18, with standard deviations from 18 to 25 parts per thousand and 0.10 to 1.59 parts per thousand, respectively. The isotope ratios of the stream base flow were consistent with the groundwater isoscape and seasonally enriched by evaporation. Most enriched water are found in raised bogs and large lakes. The most depleted water is found in a spring discharging phreatic groundwater in a forest site with sandy soil. The most enriched water was associated with significant short-lived precipitation events, resulting in impoundment of water on the land surface and its enrichment due to evaporation. The novelty of this study is that this enriched isotope signal is propagated throughout the hydrological system, temporarily albeit significantly shifting isotope ratios of phreatic groundwater and surface runoff. Further case studies are needed to affirm if this is a regionally significant mechanism controlling isotope ratios of surface and subsurface water. The observed difference between the average delta O-18 of phreatic groundwater at two locations was 0.9 parts per thousand. We suggest that the differences are due to different land use and soil conditions.

Myles			Modeling detection probability to improve marsh bird surveys in southern Canada and the Great Lakes states	AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY												Marsh birds are notoriously elusive, with variation in detection probability across species, regions, seasons, and different times of day and weather. Therefore, it is important to develop regional field survey protocols that maximize detections, but that also produce data for estimating and analytically adjusting for remaining differences in detections. We aimed to improve regional field survey protocols by estimating detection probability of eight elusive marsh bird species throughout two regions that have ongoing marsh bird monitoring programs: the southern Canadian Prairies (Prairie region) and the southern portion of the Great Lakes basin and parts of southern Quebec (Great Lakes-St. Lawrence region). We accomplished our goal using generalized binomial N-mixture models and data from similar to 22,300 marsh bird surveys conducted between 2008 and 2014 by Bird Studies Canada's Prairie, Great Lakes, and Quebec Marsh Monitoring Programs. Across all species, on average, detection probability was highest in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence region from the beginning of May until mid-June, and then fell throughout the remainder of the season until the end of June; was lowest in the Prairie region in mid-May and then increased throughout the remainder of the season until the end of June; was highest during darkness compared with light; and did not vary significantly according to temperature (range: 0-30 degrees C), cloud cover (0%-100%), or wind (0-20 kph), or during morning versus evening. We used our results to formulate improved marsh bird survey protocols for each region. Our analysis and recommendations are useful and contribute to conservation of wetland birds at various scales from local single-species studies to the continental North American Marsh Bird Monitoring Program.																			1712-6568					DEC	2016	11	2							3	10.5751/ACE-00875-110203	http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ACE-00875-110203													WOS:000392173400003

Mortality, movement and behaviour of native mussels during a planned water-level drawdown in the Upper Mississippi River	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Managers in the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) are using reductions in the River's water levels during summer to mimic historical water regimes and rehabilitate habitats for vegetation and other species. Concerns for the unintended effects of these actions on mussel populations threatened to halt these projects. Our objective was to characterise the survival and movement of two mussel species in the UMR associated with a water level drawdown. During 2009 (no drawdown) and 2010 (0.3m summer drawdown), we glued passive integrated transponder tags to 10 Amblema plicata and 10 Lampsilis cardium at each of 11 sites. Five sites were in shallow areas expected to be minimally affected by the drawdown (reference sites), and six sites were in shallow areas expected to be directly affected by the drawdown (treatment sites). About equal numbers of sites within both the reference and treatment areas had low and high slopes. Tagged mussels were randomly allocated across sites (within years). Recovery of tagged mussels was >88% in 2009 and 2010. Mortality was similar and low (mean, c.5% in both species) among reference sites but was variable and relatively high (means, c.27% in L.cardium and c.52% in A.plicata) among treatment sites; variation in mortality among treatment sites appeared related to slope. The study found evidence of drawdown associations with net horizontal movements in A.plicata but not L.cardium. Weekly horizontal movements in both species were significantly correlated with changes in water elevation. We observed significant slope associations related to the drawdown for mortality and net horizontal movement in A.plicata. There were strong species-specific differences in the effects of the drawdown on mortality, vertical movement and horizontal movement. These results suggest that A.plicata responded to the drawdown by vertical movement into the substratum, whereas L.cardium responded by horizontal movement to deeper water. No directionality of movement was observed in either species. Collectively, these data suggest that drawdowns can influence the mortality, movement and behaviour of mussels in the UMR. However, more information on spatial and temporal distributions of mussels is needed to better understand the magnitude of these effects. Results from this study are being used by resource managers to better evaluate the effects of this management tool on native mussel assemblages.

These two compounds have been identified in environmental waters worldwide, but little is known about their occurrence in Xinjiang. In this study, 155 water samples were obtained from 37 locations across Ulungur River, Manasi River, and Tarim River in Xinjiang, and were assessed by using liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. PFOS and PFOA were detected in over 50% of the samples with mean concentrations of 3.194 ng/L for PFOS and 3.460 ng/L for PFOA. Spatial and regional distribution differences do exist among the three analyzed rivers. PFOS and PFOA in Manasi River were observed at the highest levels (especially in M10 and M11), but no aggravation occurred from 2014 to 2017. Seasonal variations of PFOS and PFOA concentrations showed that water samples collected during summer were higher than those in other three seasons. The occurrence, levels, and distribution patterns of PFOS and PFOA were investigated in the present study, which provides useful theory and data support for human health risk assessment. The findings of the present study can be considered for controlling these water pollutants in environmental waters.

Resilience of phytoplankton dynamics to trophic cascades and nutrient enrichment	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Resilience was compared for alternate states of phytoplankton pigment concentration in two multiyear whole-lake experiments designed to shift the manipulated ecosystem between alternate states. Mean exit time, the average time between threshold crossings, was calculated from automated measurements every 5 min during summer stratification. Alternate states were clearly identified, and equilibria showed narrow variation in bootstrap analysis of uncertainty. Mean exit times ranged from 13 to 290 h. In the reference ecosystem, Paul Lake, mean exit time of the low-pigment state was about 100 h longer than mean exit time of the high-pigment state. In the manipulated ecosystem, Peter Lake, mean exit time of the high-pigment state exceeded that of the low-pigment state by 30 h in the cascade experiment. In the enrichment experiment mean exit time of the low-pigment state was longer than that of the high-pigment state by about 100 h. Mean exit time is a useful measure of resilience for stochastic ecosystems where high-frequency measurements are made by consistent methods over the full range of ecosystem states.

It is shown that both species richness and cell densities increase during the winter. Among the fifty-four species identified, the major groups were Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta, and Cyanobacteria (41%, 37%, and 16%, respectively). The dominant alga on stony substrates throughout the study period was the diatom Gomphonema sp., accompanied by Cymbella sp., Navicula spp., and Nitzschia spp. The Chlorophyta were represented by Cladophora glomerata (Linnaeus) Kutzing, Tetraedron minimum (A.Braun) Hansgirg, and the Cyanobacteria by Lyngbya sp. The substrate effect on algal growth was also determined. The results show that 66%, 20%, and 14% of all epilithic algae were found on limestone, basalt, and flint, respectively. In the depth profile, two peaks of epilithic algae were revealed. The first was found at 0.25-0.70 m, dominated by the Bacillariophyta Gomphonema sp., Nitzschia spp., Navicula spp., Cymbella sp., Cocconeis sp., Achnanthes sp., and Synedra ulna (Nitzsch) Ehrenberg. A second peak was found between 1.20-1.60 m, with Chlorophyta, mainly Cladophora glomerata, being dominant. The Cyanobacteria Lyngbya sp. and Chroococcus sp. were evenly distributed at all depths.																			0792-9978						2008	56	1-2					83	90		10.1560/IJPS.56.1-2.83	http://dx.doi.org/10.1560/IJPS.56.1-2.83													WOS:000262314200012

However, due to indirect effects, some responses can be complex and difficult to predict. For example, our understanding of effects on consumers involving responses on several trophic levels is limited. Here, combining the knowledge of trophic interactions in the EU's fourth largest lake with long-term climate and catch data, we analyse potential drivers of change in this system's apex predator. We show that warm winters correlate with later poor catches of great Arctic charr (Salvelinus umbla), and that in recent years predator-prey cycles involving this species have disappeared. The likely mechanisms are trophic mismatches directly and indirectly affecting two stages of charr, the fry and the juveniles, respectively. Our study illustrates how a long-lived consumer may be subjected to double jeopardy from the effects of warming across trophic levels, and that a food web approach can aid in disentangling the chain of mechanisms responsible.

Patterns of change in the very long record of pelagic summer zooplankton in Lake Ladoga, spanning the years 1948-1993, are presented. This data is complemented with records of near-shore zooplankton communities from the past decade, the changes of which are discussed with special reference to two contrasting littoral areas: the southern bays, and the northern archipelago. In the pelagic zone the zooplankton community shows great stability throughout the entire monitoring period. According to zooplankton, the trophic state of the pelagial region may be classified as oligo-mesotrophic, with only a slight trend of eutrophication evident in the uppermost water layers. In the littoral zones more prominent eutrophication is indicated.																			0018-8158					APR 12	1996	322	1-3					173	179		10.1007/BF00031824	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00031824													WOS:A1996UT84700028

The main benefits of this site compared with others are the combination of strong UV radiation, the presence of permafrost, and geothermal activity within a dry terrain. The interaction between limited snow events and wind results in snow patches buried under a dry soil surface. This leads to ephemeral water streams that only flow during daytime hours. On this volcano, which has the highest located subsurface temperature monitoring systems reported to date, seasonal melting of the permafrost is followed by fast percolation events. This is due to the high porosity of these soils. The results are landforms, shaped by the strong winds. At this site, both thermal springs and lakes (the latter arising from melting ice) provide habitats for life; a 6480 m high lake heated by volcanic activity shows both warm and cold sediments that contain a number of different microbial species, including psychrophiles. Where the permafrost melts, thawing ponds have formed at 5900 m that are dominated by populations of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, while in the pond sediments and the permafrost itself Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Patescibacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia are abundant. In turn, fumaroles show the presence of acidophilic iron-oxidizers and iron-reducing species. In spite of the extreme conditions reported at Ojos del Salado, this site is easily accessible.

J	Bowman, JP				Bowman, JP			Psychrophilic prokaryote structural-functional relationships, biogeography and evolution within marine sediment	CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY												Prokaryote diversity has been found to be surprisingly high in cold marine sediments with numerous clades detected spread throughout many phyla. Marine benthic sediment clades are largely ecotypically distinct and autochthonous. Since almost all marine sediment prokaryotic taxa have yet to be cultivated, functionality is currently overwhelmingly cryptic for most benthic prokaryotic taxa except those falling into specific lineages for which there is cultivation or detailed biogeochemical data. Multivariate statistical comparisons of 16S rRNA gene sequence and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) data show distinct distribution patterns of prokaryotic communities in sediment layers. By comparison geographical differences and differences related to the physical texture and organic content seem to result in generally smaller differences.

Meltwater produced by wind-albedo interaction stored in an East Antarctic ice shelf	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE												Surface melt and subsequent firn air depletion can ultimately lead to disintegration of Antarctic ice shelves(1,2) causing grounded glaciers to accelerate(3) and sea level to rise. In the Antarctic Peninsula, foehn winds enhance melting near the grounding line(4), which in the recent past has led to the disintegration of the most northerly ice shelves(5,6). Here, we provide observational and model evidence that this process also occurs over an East Antarctic ice shelf, where meltwater-induced firn air depletion is found in the grounding zone. Unlike the Antarctic Peninsula, where foehn events originate from episodic interaction of the circumpolar westerlies with the topography, in coastal East Antarctica high temperatures are caused by persistent katabatic winds originating from the ice sheet's interior. Katabatic winds warm and mix the air as it flows downward and cause widespread snow erosion, explaining >3 K higher near-surface temperatures in summer and surface melt doubling in the grounding zone compared with its surroundings. Additionally, these winds expose blue ice and firn with lower surface albedo, further enhancing melt. The in situ observation of supraglacial flow and englacial storage of meltwater suggests that ice-shelf grounding zones in East Antarctica, like their Antarctic Peninsula counterparts, are vulnerable to hydrofracturing(7).					van de Berg, Willem/H-4385-2011; Drews, Reinhard/AAP-4134-2021; Lhermitte, Stef (Stefaan)/A-3385-2013; Eisen, Olaf/K-3846-2012; Pattyn, Frank/AAA-9640-2019; van den Broeke, Michiel Roland/F-7867-2011; Ligtenberg, Stefan/AAF-8290-2020; Van den Broeke, Michiel/F-7867-2011; Lenaerts, Jan/D-9423-2012; van Meijgaard, Erik/ADA-0860-2022	Drews, Reinhard/0000-0002-2328-294X; Pattyn, Frank/0000-0003-4805-5636; van den Broeke, Michiel Roland/0000-0003-4662-7565; Berger, Sophie/0000-0003-4095-9323; Lhermitte, Stef/0000-0002-1622-0177; Lenaerts, Jan/0000-0003-4309-4011; 													1758-678X	1758-6798				JAN	2017	7	1					58	+		10.1038/NCLIMATE3180	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NCLIMATE3180													WOS:000396346700016
J	JACKSON, TA				JACKSON, TA			ACCUMULATION OF MERCURY BY PLANKTON AND BENTHIC INVERTEBRATES IN RIVERINE LAKES OF NORTHERN MANITOBA (CANADA) - IMPORTANCE OF REGIONALLY AND SEASONALLY VARYING ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Mercury (Hg) concentrations in plankton and benthic invertebrates from riverine lakes of northern Manitoba were generally found to be unrelated, or inversely related, to inorganic and methyl mercury levels and Hg methylation rates in their habitats but were strongly dependent on environmental factors. The relationships suggest that the uptake of Hg by these organisms was controlled largely by suspended and sedimentary Hg-binding substances such as FeOOH, MnOOH, organic matter, sulfides, and clay. The sole exception was midsummer phytoplankton, whose Hg content was a function of Hg levels in local sediments, probably because interference by suspended detritus was minimal; during the spring flood, such interference had a predominant effect. Aeration of lake water by fluvial currents probably enhances the availability of Hg to plankton by promoting decomposition of organic matter and sulfides but decreases the availability of Hg to some benthic animals by causing MnOOH precipitation. FeOOH apparently limits Hg uptake by chironomid larvae but MnOOH limits Hg uptake by oligochates, nematodes, and pelecypods, suggesting preferential uptake of certain forms of Hg by particular biological and mineral species. Decreases in temperature may also retard Hg uptake by benthos. Biodilution has no significant effect on Hg accumulation by benthos or plankton.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				OCT	1988	45	10					1744	1757		10.1139/f88-206	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f88-206													WOS:A1988Q469800009

Mean summer seston respiration rates ranged between 4 and 80 mg O2 .cntdot. m-3 .cntdot. d-1. Rates of seston respiration were proportional to the in situ water temperature and to the concentration of Chlorophyll a. The amount of oxygen consumed in the water column and the fraction of the total oxygen deficit produced by sestonic respiration were correlated with the amount of phosphorus sedimented from the epilimnion. Fifteen to 66% of the total oxygen consumption occurred in the water column of the hypolimnion. Seston respiration was a larger proportion of the total respiration in the hypolimnion of lakes with a thick hypolimnion than in lakes with a shallow hypolimnetic water column.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	1987	44	1					146	151		10.1139/f87-019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f87-019													WOS:A1987G059200018

Between October 2006 and February 2008, fifteen consecutive one month-long samples, with air volumes ranging from 4,500 to 16,000 m(3), were taken and analyzed for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). Separate analysis of three polyurethane plugs in series in combination with frontal chromatographic theory allows for the correction of the break-through observed for the most volatile SOCs. The concentrations of Sigma 56PCB in air range from 0.10 to 2.6 pg.m(-3) and are among the lowest values ever reported. Levels of OCPs at Nam Co are generally also very low, particularly during wintertime. The concentrations of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), endosulfans, and various dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) related substances display a distinct seasonal variability consistent with the monsoon. Back-trajectory analysis reveals that higher OCP levels during summer correlate with air mass origin south of the Himalayas. A high alpha/gamma-HCH ratio and a non-racemic composition of alpha-HCH during July/August suggest that evaporation from Nam Co Lake contributes to the relatively high concentrations of alpha-HCH (averaging ca. 91 pg.m(-3)) recorded in the summertime atmosphere.

Dissolved iron (D-Fe), which is operationally defined as that passing through a 0.2-mu m pore filter, acid-labile particulate iron (LP-Fe), and chemical speciation of dissolved iron were analyzed. LP-Fe was extracted from the suspended solids (SS) on 0.2-mu m pore-size filters after a 2 h soak in 25% (4.5 M) acetic acid. The chemical speciation of dissolved iron was determined using cathodic stripping voltammetry. The concentration of D-Fe ranged from 72 to 1354 nM and that of filterable labile iron (FL-Fe) from 5 to 881 nM, and both increased markedly after two heavy rains. The increased D-Fe and FL-Fe appeared to be removed within a few days. The concentrations of LP-Fe ranged from 4.1 to 16.1 mu M, were much higher than those of D-Fe, and did not increase after the rains. There was a significant correlation (|r| = 0.88, P < 0.01) between ln[D-Fe] and pH. This suggests that the dynamics of D-Fe in the canal depend upon the cycle of adsorptive removal onto the surface of SS at high pH and desorptive supply from the surface of SS at low pH. Moreover, D-Fe concentration would also be controlled by the formation of iron oxyhydroxides amorphous particles at high pH and dissolution at low pH. The percentage of organically complexed iron ranged from 35% to 99% and varied markedly at time scales of days to weeks. There was a significant correlation (r = 0.60, P < 0.01) between the percentage of organically complexed iron and the log of the cell density of Microcystis spp.. This suggests that the growth of specific algal species affects iron speciation in the canal.					; Fukushima, Takehiko/S-9801-2019	Fukushima, Takehiko/0000-0003-2494-309X; 													1015-1621					DEC	2008	70	4					388	396		10.1007/s00027-008-8011-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-008-8011-7													WOS:000261329000004

Large areas ill the affected region are considered sensitive to acid precipitation due to geological and climatological conditions. Extensive surface water acidification has taken place, particularly, in the mountain and remote tundra regions. Critical loads and their exceedances have been calculated for 370 lakes sampled in the Kola peninsula. These data indicate that the surface waters in the Kola North are highly sensitive to acidic deposition.

Only the latter contains high concentrations of hydrolyzable tannins known to interfere with the growth of insect herbivores. We tested whether larvae grow faster on Potamogeton perfoliatus or M. spicatum and whether this is due to polyphenols in their food source. Larvae originating from the same egg clutch grew faster and larger on P perfoliatus than on M. spicatum. The same growth response was observed with larvae that spent winter diapause on either P perfoliatus or M. spicatum. These larvae were fed either with their host plant or the other macrophyte. No prior feeding effect was found, but growth of larvae reared on M. spicatum was less than when grown on P perfoliatus. Larvae from another egg-clutch reared on M. spicatum, either from lake or cultivated in aquaria, exhibited reduced growth on the lake plants. P perfoliatus contained less than 1% and M. spicatum (aquarium or field material) between 5 and 9% phenolic compounds. No differences in nitrogen content of leaves were found, but apical shoot sections of M. spicatum exhibited a significantly higher nitrogen content than P perfoliatus. Our results indicate that hydrolyzable tannins are responsible for the reduced growth of Acentria when fed with M. spicatum.

Still, these are of considerable interest due to the species biogeography and autecology as well as global climate change. Here, we used high-throughput 18S rRNA amplicon sequencing to study the microeukaryotic communities of the large subarctic freshwater lakes Labynkyr and Vorota in Yakutia, Russia, during the end of the ice cover period, from April to June. By applying the statistical methods, we coupled the microeukaryotic community structure profiles with available discrete factor variables and hydrophysical, hydrochemical, and environmental parameters. The sub-ice layer and the water column communities were differentiated due to the temporal change in environmental conditions, particularly temperature regime and electric conductivity. Additionally, the community composition of unicellular eukaryotes in lakes Labynkyr and Vorota was changing due to seasonal environmental factors, with these alterations having similar patterns in both sites. We suggest the community developed in the sub-ice layer in April serves as a primer for summer freshwater microeukaryotes. Our results extend the current knowledge on the community composition and seasonal succession of unicellular eukaryotes within subarctic freshwater ecosystems.

An extensive survey, larger and broader in scale than previous studies, was conducted in summer 2010. The highest microcystin concentration was found at southern part of Taihu, which was newly included in this survey. In northern coastal areas, total cellular concentrations of 20 to 44 mu g/L were observed. In northern offshore waters, levels were up to 4.8 mu g/L. Microcystin occurrence was highly correlated with chemical oxygen demand, turbidity, and chlorophyll-a. Extracellular/total cellular microcystin (E/T) ratios were calculated and compared to other water quality parameters. A higher correlation was found using E/T ratios than original microcystin values.

J	Golosov, S; Kirillin, G				Golosov, Sergey; Kirillin, Georgiy			A parameterized model of heat storage by lake sediments	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												A model of seasonal heat storage by lake sediments is proposed oriented at applications in climate modeling and at lake parameterization in numerical weather prediction. The computational efficiency is achieved by reformulating of the heat transfer problem as a set of ordinary differential equations for evolution of the temperature wave inside the upper sediment layer. Arising temperature and depth scales completely replace the conductivity of the sediment in the heat transfer equation and can be easily achieved from the lake water temperature observations without any data on the sediment thermal properties. The method is proposed for the scales estimation from the inverse solution of the model equations in special case of the constant water-sediment heat flux in ice-covered lakes. The method is tested on data from sediments of Lake Krasnoye, North-Western Russia. The long-term (1961-2002) modeling of temperature in German lakes Muggelsee and Heiligensee with a coupled one-dimensional model of lake water column and sediments has demonstrated an appreciable effect of the sediment heat storage on near-bottom temperatures in both lakes. Thus, incorporation of the sediment layer into lake temperature models can essentially improve, at low computational costs, the model performance, especially for shallow lakes. In addition, a better forecast of near-bottom temperature evolution on climatic scales can provide a better understanding of the response of lake benthic communities to global warming.

J	ROSA, F				ROSA, F			SEDIMENTATION AND SEDIMENT RESUSPENSION IN LAKE-ONTARIO	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												From March to Nov. 1981, seasonal variations in the weekly sedimentation rates of particulate matter were investigated at an inshore and at an offshore site in Lake Ontario. Sedimentation rates at both sites showed extremely high variability from week to week; minimum to maximum rates varied by a factor of 10 for the offshore site and by a factor of 40 for the inshore site. The variability in the offshore rates was mainly due to the amount of particulate matter in the epilimnion, and in the inshore rates was mainly due to bottom sediment resuspension. Offshore sedimentation rates of total suspended matter measured in the thermocline were a function of the total suspended matter concentrations in the epilimnion. Sedimentation rates measured in the thermocline were higher than those measured at the top of the hypolimnion showing particulate matter retention in the thermocline. Sedimentation rates measured at 5 m above the bottom at both stations were extremely variable with time and the inshore rates at times exceeded the offshore rates by a factor of 50. This major difference was observed during fall turnover, when previously sedimented material and associated contaminants were resuspended at the inshore site. Since the net downward flux is a function of epilimnetic concentrations, inshore resuspension occurs continuously but at varying intensities.																			0380-1330						1985	11	1					13	25		10.1016/S0380-1330(85)71738-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(85)71738-8													WOS:A1985AES0100002

Spatial and temporal variability in recruitment of the cyanobacterium Gloeotrichia echinulata in an oligotrophic lake	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Recruitment from dormant stages in the benthos can provide a critically important inoculum for surface populations of phytoplankton, including bloom-forming cyanobacteria. For example, water-column populations of the large (1-3-mm diameter) colonial cyanobacterium Gloeotrichia echinulata (Smith) P. Richter can be strongly subsidized by benthic recruitment. Therefore, understanding controls on recruitment is essential to an investigation of the factors controlling Gloeotrichia blooms, which are increasing in low-nutrient lakes across northeastern North America. We quantified surface abundances and recruitment from littoral sediments at multiple near-shore sampling sites in oligotrophic Lake Sunapee, New Hampshire, USA, during the summers of 2005-2012 and used this data set-the longest known record of cyanobacterial recruitment-to investigate potential drivers of interannual differences in Gloeotrichia recruitment. We found extensive spatiotemporal variability in recruitment. Recruitment was higher at some sites than others, and within seasons, recruitment into replicate traps at the same site was generally more similar than recruitment at different sites. These data suggest that local factors, such as substrate quality or the size of the seed bank, may be important controls on recruitment. Benthic recruitment probably accounted for <4%, but possibly up to 8%, of pelagic populations, within the range observed in previous studies. Across years, higher seasonal recruitment rates were associated with greater lake mixing during August, including deeper thermoclines, lower Schmidt stability, lower minimum air temperatures, and greater variability in water temperature. Taken together, our data suggest that interannual variation in Gloeotrichia recruitment may be related to regional climatic variability.					; Carey, Cayelan/D-4874-2016; Cottingham, Kathryn/AAV-3934-2021	Cottingham, Kathryn/0000-0003-3169-5047; Greer, Meredith/0000-0002-9543-4498; 													2161-9549	2161-9565				JUN	2014	33	2					577	592		10.1086/675734	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/675734													WOS:000337521400018
J	Scott, D; Irvine, JR				Scott, D; Irvine, JR			Competitive exclusion of brown trout Salmo trutta L., by rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum, in lake tributaries, New Zealand	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Spawning runs of brown trout Salmo trutta L., and rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum, were compared in three tributaries of two lakes for timing, numbers and redd characteristics. Redd characteristics for the two species in four other streams were examined. No significant differences in redd characteristics between the two species were observed, but in all lake tributaries the possibilities of superimposition of spring spawning rainbow trout on redds of brown trout were examined. A common feature was the high ratio of numbers of spawners to the area of preferred spawning gravel, and it was concluded that in the lake tributaries, superimposition resulted in increased mortality of brown trout eggs, and in one case elimination of the brown trout population. Management possibilities for control of the species proportions in comparable situations are discussed.

Light attenuation provided the best prediction of PC abundance, explaining half of the variation in summer abundance. Phycoerythrin-containing PC were particularly abundant (> 10(5) cells ml-1) in oligotrophic to mesotrophic hard-water lakes, while nonphycoerythrin types were generally found in eutrophic and colored lakes. The percentage of phycoerythrin-containing PC declined significantly with increasing light attenuation among lakes and within experimental enclosures of one lake where light attenuation was altered by nutrient additions and food-web manipulations. The relationship may be the consequence of changes in spectral quality as lakes become nutrient enriched or colored by humic material.

J	Beuving, JJ				Beuving, J. Joost			PLAYING POOL ALONG THE SHORES OF LAKE VICTORIA: FISHERMEN, CAREERS AND CAPITAL ACCUMULATION IN THE UGANDAN NILE PERCH BUSINESS	AFRICA												The 1990s saw the emergence of a thriving Nile perch export market from East Africa. This commercial table fish species is landed by migrant fishermen at villages that have sprung up along the shores of Lake Victoria, and then exported to overseas markets. By analysing the Ugandan perch fishery as a set of careers, the article shows that, although some fishermen have benefited from the perch boom, most face an uncertain and marginal existence. Few of them, however, move away in response. Analysis of an anthropological case study reveals that this is because the fishermen value the urban culture characterizing prominent village landings, expressed in particular clothing and hairstyles, the prevalence of non-kin ties, and a prospering leisure industry epitomized by the proliferation of pool tables. Hence, a cultural preference for life at the landings, rather than a universal quest for economic opportunity, drives their economic decision making.

We find that during the summer months chinook salmon inhabited epilimnetic waters with temperatures of -19-20 degrees C as far back as the late 1980s. Chinook would approach but rarely exceed their reported upper incipient lethal limit of approximately 22 degrees C, which suggests that these fish were seeking water with temperatures as high as was tolerable while otolith growth occurred. These results contrast with expected midsummer temperatures for this cold-water salmonine. Bioenergetic simulations indicate significant stress imposed upon chinook salmon. We estimate consumption to be up to 20% more and gross conversion efficiency 18% less annually relative to nominal simulations where chinook salmon are modeled nearer their preferred temperature, reinforcing previous inferences that the chinook salmon population may be near the limits of sustainability. We also find a strong negative correlation between delta O-18 and delta C-13 values. Therefore, seasonal and ontogenetic variation in delta C-13 values of chinook salmon otoliths appear to be related to metabolic rate during pelagic residence and may provide an indirect method for evaluating field activity and other aspects of fish life history.					; Patterson, William/J-6473-2012; Wurster, Christopher/A-1983-2011	Patterson, William/0000-0003-3387-708X; Wurster, Christopher/0000-0002-2866-5798; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				MAR	2005	62	3					700	713		10.1139/F04-241	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F04-241													WOS:000228664500019

The optimal water temperature for embryonic development of this population is 21 degrees C However, in some cases, the temperatures of the spawning grounds during bream spawning are much higher, becoming semi-lethal or even lethal for bream embryos. The aim of the study was to investigate the natural and artificial spawning effectiveness of bream during a 4-year study regarding the reproductive effectiveness of the wild bream population in relation to thermal fluctuation (optimal and semi-lethal) of their ecosystem during the natural spawning season. During four following seasons, the bream spawners, as well as the eggs, were collected from the spawning grounds and incubated at optimal (21 degrees C) and semi-lethal (23 degrees C) temperatures. The spawning of mature bream was artificially induced and the obtained eggs were also incubated at the same temperatures. The period of observed spawners on the spawning grounds was different in different years: the longest time of bream spawning was in the second year of the study and the shortest was during the third year of the study. In the last year, a decrease in water temperature caused a break in the spawning. Thermal changes in water temperature during the spawning season may have caused a high mortality level of bream embryos and decreased the recruitment of the next species generation.

We calibrated LM3-Eutro using a 2-year (1994-1995) dataset and performed a hindcast simulation from 1976 to 1995 to evaluate the model's ability to make predictions over an extended period of time. Results show a reasonable agreement between model output and field data over this time period. The model predicted that an annual loading of 5600 metric tons (MT) would result in a lake-wide annual total phosphorus (TP) concentration of 7.5 mu g L(-1). Using best estimates of future TP loadings, LM3-Eutro forecasts suggest that lake Michigan will remain oligotrophic and will continue to meet the 7 mu g L(-1) spring TP concentration Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement objective.

A humid Early Holocene monsoon climate is also indicated by a well-developed Holocene soil formed across the Loess Plateau during the period. Our study, like many global climate change models, suggests that millennial-scale climate oscillations with a periodicity of about 1500 years occurred throughout both wet and dry periods of the Holocene. These oscillations were pervasive and persistent following the last glacial. Multi-centennial cycles are evident in the pollen records dating to the Early Holocene. Ten dry intervals indicating a weak summer monsoon at 0-0.5, 1.2-1.9, 2.4-3.4, 5.0-7.1, similar to 7.8, 8.3-8.8, 9.2-9.7, 10.4-11.2, 11.6-12.8, and 13.3-13.8 ka are documented by multi-proxies at the SJC section. Long, intense dry events, such as at around 1.0, 3.0, and 5-7 ka, are also recorded by interruptions in Holocene soil development. Three less-intensive dry episodes at around 8.5, 9.5, and 10.0 ka in the humid Early Holocene that normally are not evident in pure eolian loess-soil sequences were documented at a high-resolution fluvial loess-soil sequence. Our study suggests cold climate events in the North Atlantic region are coeval with dry climate events (indicating a weak summer monsoon) along the East Asian Monsoon margin following the last glacial. This supports the hypothesis that Holocene climatic events are strongly correlated throughout at least the Northern Hemisphere.					; Bolang, Cheng/JFA-9440-2023; Fahu, Chen/B-2788-2011	Chen, Fahu/0000-0002-8874-1035; 													1571-0866		978-0-08-054431-1; 978-0-44-452962-6				2007	9						25	39		10.1016/S1571-0866(07)09004-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1571-0866(07)09004-5													WOS:000311224900003

Although the microbiota of silver carp has been widely studied, the data on microbial variation according to fish tissues and local habitats are lacking. In this study, the microbes in the guts and gills of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) from the hydrophyte-dominated region (zone H) and the algae-dominated region (zone A) of Taihu Lake in autumn were analyzed. Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Firmicutes were the dominant bacteria in silver carp. The microbial diversity was higher in the gills than that in the intestines, and higher in fish from zone H than that from zone A. Beta diversity analysis revealed significant differences in microbial community structures between gill and guts, and between fish from the two habitats. Gills had a higher abundance of phyla Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Deinococcus-Thermus, and a lower abundance of verrucomicrobia than the intestine. Both tissues possessed indicator taxa, while many indicator taxa in the gill were conditional pathogens. Compared to fish from zone H, fish from zone A had more abundant Cyanobacteria, and less abundant Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. PICRUSt2 analysis revealed that fish microbial functions were mainly associated with metabolism, replication, repair, folding, sorting, and degradation. These results showed that the microbial community of silver carp from Taihu Lake varied according to tissues and habitats.

Mortality of P. ponderosa greater than 22 cm diameter at breast height was higher in burned areas (19.5%) than in unburned areas (6.6%), and early-season burns had over 30% mortality. Mortality was associated with fire severity, as measured by scorch height and ground char, season of burning, and tree vigor. Pines of high, moderate, and low vigor were subjected to a prescribed burn in June; half of the trees had debris raked from tree bases as an additional treatment. Lethal heat loads (> 60-degrees-C) occurred in > 75% of samples at the soil surface and at 5 cm soil depth, with duration exceeding 5 h. Burning reduced fine-root dry weight 50-75% 1 and 5 months after burning; raking and burning reduced fine-root dry weight more than burning alone after 1 month and had similar effects to burning after 5 months. A low-vigor tree that had been raked and burned died by the beginning of the fourth dry season after burning. Present fuel loads may be too high to burn during spring if old-growth P. ponderosa are to be protected.																			0045-5067					MAY	1991	21	5					626	634		10.1139/x91-086	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x91-086													WOS:A1991FM12600011

Impacts of a recent storm surge on an Arctic delta ecosystem examined in the context of the last millennium	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												One of the most ominous predictions related to recent climatic warming is that low-lying coastal environments will be inundated by higher sea levels. The threat is especially acute in polar regions because reductions in extent and duration of sea ice cover increase the risk of storm surge occurrence. The Mackenzie Delta of northwest Canada is an ecologically significant ecosystem adapted to freshwater flooding during spring breakup. Marine storm surges during the open-water season, which move saltwater into the delta, can have major impacts on terrestrial and aquatic systems. We examined growth rings of alder shrubs (Alnus viridis subsp. fruticosa) and diatoms preserved in dated lake sediment cores to show that a recent marine storm surge in 1999 caused widespread ecological changes across a broad extent of the outer Mackenzie Delta. For example, diatom assemblages record a striking shift from freshwater to brackish species following the inundation event. What is of particular significance is that the magnitude of this recent ecological impact is unmatched over the >1,000-year history of this lake ecosystem. We infer that no biological recovery has occurred in this lake, while large areas of terrestrial vegetation remain dramatically altered over a decade later, suggesting that these systems may be on a new ecological trajectory. As climate continues to warm and sea ice declines, similar changes will likely be repeated in other coastal areas of the circumpolar Arctic. Given the magnitude of ecological changes recorded in this study, such impacts may prove to be long lasting or possibly irreversible.					; Nesbitt, Holly/KDN-0084-2024; Lantz, Trevor/J-1163-2014; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; Nesbitt, Holly/0000-0002-4455-7607; Pisaric, Michael/0000-0003-3806-8986													0027-8424	1091-6490				MAY 31	2011	108	22					8960	8965		10.1073/pnas.1018527108	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1018527108								21576496					WOS:000291106200018

Based on experimental data on the determination of concentrations of chemical elements for the long-term observation period from 1992 to 2019, a trend of reducing the content of biogenic elements over the past 14 years has been revealed. This is a consequence of reducing the anthropogenic load due to the reconstruction of treatment facilities on the Estonian and Russian sides. Analysis of intra-annual changes in the content of biogenic elements showed a steady increase in the content of nitrogen compounds during high water with maximum water runoff and an increase in phosphorus content in the autumn period. This indicates a significant influence of the waters of Lake Peipus and the Narva reservoir, which determine the intra-reservoir processes that intensify at the end of the warm season. The calculation of runoff based on experimental data of average annual water consumption and monthly determinations of concentrations of mineral, biogenic and organic substances for the period from 1992 to 2019. The calculated values of the runoff indicators are: ionic runoff 43,1 t/km2, total phosphorus 9,8 kg/km2, total nitrogen 142 kg/km2, organic carbon 2,75 t/km2, according to the background values of the runoff indicators of the Baltic region. It is important to note that for the period from 1993 to 2006; significantly higher runoff rates for phosphorus phosphates and nitrogen nitrates corresponded to the literature data on runoff from reclaimed agricultural areas, which also indicates a significant decrease in the biogenic load on the Narva River in the last decade from 2006 to 2019.																			2541-9668	2587-585X					2023	68	1								10.21638/spbu07.2023.108	http://dx.doi.org/10.21638/spbu07.2023.108													WOS:000968511800008

A comparison of simulated and measured lake ice thickness using a Shallow Water Ice Profiler	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES					Joint Meeting of the Canadian-Geophysical-Union/Canadian-Meteorology-and-Oceanographic-Society	MAY 31-JUN 04, 2010	Ottawa, CANADA	Canadian Geophys Union, Canadian Meteorol & Oceanog Soc				In northern regions where observational data is sparse, lake ice models are ideal tools as they can provide valuable information on ice cover regimes. The Canadian Lake Ice Model was used to simulate ice cover for a lake near Churchill, Manitoba, Canada throughout the 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 ice covered seasons. To validate and improve the model results, in situ measurements of the ice cover through both seasons were obtained using an upward-looking sonar device Shallow Water Ice Profiler (SWIP) installed on the bottom of the lake. The SWIP identified the ice-on/off dates as well as collected ice thickness measurements. In addition, a digital camera was installed on shore to capture images of the ice cover through the seasons and field measurements were obtained of snow depth on the ice, and both the thickness of snow ice (if present) and total ice cover. Altering the amounts of snow cover on the ice surface to represent potential snow redistribution affected simulated freeze-up dates by a maximum of 22 days and break-up dates by a maximum of 12 days, highlighting the importance of accurately representing the snowpack for lake ice modelling. The late season ice thickness tended to be under estimated by the simulations with break-up occurring too early, however, the evolution of the ice cover was simulated to fall between the range of the full snow and no snow scenario, with the thickness being dependant on the amount of snow cover on the ice surface.

J	Rosenblum, ZH; Schmeier, S				Rosenblum, Zoe Hoffman; Schmeier, Susanne			Global Wetland Governance: Introducing the Transboundary Wetlands Database	WATER												The water governance discourse focuses on the use of water from rivers-and increasingly lakes and aquifers-for a variety of human uses, often in a competing manner. Largely missing from this discourse are wetlands. Despite an increased understanding of the benefits of wetlands, global wetland area continues to decrease. Particularly in international river basins, upstream water withdrawals are having negative impacts on wetlands, and the communities that rely on them downstream. Following the framework of transboundary water cooperation, the joint management of transboundary wetlands in the context of integrated basin management may prevent conflict and lead to further collaboration. As a first step to understand how wetlands may fit into water cooperation, this research employs spatial analysis and document analysis to identify transboundary wetlands and possible institutions to manage them, providing a basis for analyzing conflict and cooperation dynamics in them. The products of this research are a database and map of 300 transboundary wetlands, including the river basins (and, when applicable, the River Basin Organizations) they fall within.

Arcellacea (Testate Lobose Amoebae) as pH Indicators in a Pyrite Mine-Acidified Lake, Northeastern Ontario, Canada	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Arcellacea (testate lobose amoebae) were examined in 24 sediment-water interface samples collected over two late August field seasons in 2010 and 2011, from James and Granite lakes, Temagami Region, Northeastern Ontario. The work was carried out to quantitatively test species-environment relationships in a lake system known to be characterized by a significant pH gradient, partially the result of contamination from the early twentieth century Northland Pyrite Mine Co., located on the shoreline in the southern basin of James Lake. Redundancy analysis confirmed that arcellacean assemblage structure was most strongly controlled by pH, explaining 14.06 % (p < 0.002) of the total variance. Q- and R-mode cluster analysis supported by detrended correspondence analysis yielded two major faunal assemblages. The Oligotrophic Assemblage (1) had a Shannon Diversity Index (SDI) ranging up to 2.45, typical of healthy boreal lakes. This assemblage characterized samples collected from higher pH stations within James and Granite lakes away from the immediate area of the mine site, while the Low pH Assemblage 2010 (2a) and Low pH Assemblage 2011 (2b) groupings were from the very low pH environments of James Lake adjacent to the former mine site. Both low diversity assemblages (SDI ranging from 0.62 to 1.22) were characterized by Arcella vulgaris, a species known to thrive in hostile lacustrine environments. Differing depositional conditions during August 2010, a probable result of different prevailing wind patterns that summer, led to allochthonous specimens of the seasonally planktic Cucurbitella tricuspis dominating the Low pH Assemblage 2010 (2a) fauna.

J	Bradbury, P; Cumming, B; Laird, K				Bradbury, P; Cumming, B; Laird, K			A 1500-year record of climatic and environmental change in Elk Lake, Minnesota - III: measures of past primary productivity	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Diatom analysis of a varved sediment core from Elk Lake, Minnesota documents important natural and human-caused shifts in primary productivity at decadal scales for the past 1500 years. Interpretations from a perspective of planktic diatom seasonal dynamics and from total phosphorus inferences based on a 111-lake training set of freshwater Canadian lakes reveal a major change to more productive environments after 1000 years ago probably caused by earlier ice-out and stronger, longer periods of lake circulation during the spring. European impacts in the region, principally logging in the Elk Lake drainage, during the past 100 years increased nutrient fluxes and turbulence during the open water season to promote blooms of Aulacoseira ambigua. High resolution (semi-decadal) diatom analyses suggest sunspot cycle periodicities that may reflect short-term changes in the character of irradiance and (or) sun-climate interactions. Total epilimnetic phosphorus inferences from the Canadian training set applied to the Elk Lake diatom record document both long-term and short-term variations in productivity and reconstruct past phosphorus values consistent with some present-day measured values at Elk Lake. The Elk Lake study underscores the need for neolimnological monitoring of both training set and target lakes as well as for the application of a multiple proxy protocol to document paleo-productivity that approaches neolimnological resolution.																			0921-2728					APR	2002	27	3					321	340		10.1023/A:1016035313101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1016035313101													WOS:000176505000003

Processes of Methane Cycle and Destruction of Organic Matter during the Ice Period in Freshwater Bodies of Various Types	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												Studies conducted in January to March at different parts of the Rybinsk Reservoir, in lakes of various types, and in a pond have demonstrated that the processes of CH4 cycle during the ice period play an important role in the destruction of C-org and functioning of the ecosystem food webs. In highly trophic polluted lakes, the formation of CH4 takes place both in silts and in the water column, and its gross production reaches a high summer level of 540-1220 mg C-org/(m(2) day). Taking into the account methanogenesis, 68-97% of the destruction of organic matter (OM) occurs due to the processes in bottom sediments. In the silts of productive lakes, only anaerobic processes cause the destruction.

Late Miocene to Early Pliocene paleohydrology and landscape evolution of Northern Chile, 19° to 20° S	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Northern Chile's forearc lies in the hyperarid Atacama Desert. The northern portion (similar to 150 km) of the forearc basin, known as the Central Depression, contains perennial streams that drain to the Pacific Ocean through canyons that are deeply incised within a pediplain. However, during the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene a lake existed in the western part of the Central Depression between 19.3 degrees S and 19.7 degrees S, indicating a forearc geomorphic landscape and paleohydrologic regime distinct from the present one. For approximately 2 Ma, this lake was large (similar to 375 km(2)) and deep (up to similar to 120 m). The catchment area sourcing the lake covered an area of 2900-5200 km(2). New 40Ar/39Ar ages of volcanic ashes intercalated with the lake deposits and the overlying fluvial deposits indicate that lacustrine diatomite-rich deposition had begun by 10.86 +/- 0.04 Ma, and the final stage of incision of a canyon through the lake deposits is younger than 3.04 +/- 0.03 Ma. Additional published age constraints demonstrate that the expanse of the lake shrunk shortly after 9 Ma, yet the water balance in the western sector of the basin permitted lacustrine diatomite deposition until more recently than similar to 6.4 Ma. Even after the sediment- hydrology balance shifted from balanced-fill to overfilled, a near-surface groundwater table led to accumulation of salt pan (salar) evaporites until more recently than similar to 3.5 Ma. The existence of a large deep lake is consistent with, but not conclusive evidence for, a wetter than modern climate in the catchment region during the Late Miocene. The ultimate demise of the paleolake system is attributed to a kilometer-scale decline of the base level of drainages downstream of the paleolake. This study takes advantage of the unique characteristic of the drainage profiles in the study region, a spatial separation between areas of deep incision east and west of a prominent knickzone, to evaluate three end member scenarios of landscape evolution that could explain the base level fall event(s). The sedimentological, stratigraphic, and geomorphological data best fit the interpretation that forearc tectonic uplift and tectonically driven coastal retreat both contributed to base level fall.

The combined approach of using the NGRDI algorithm and atmospherically-corrected Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) data showed an advantage over other popular approaches. The algorithm was then applied to 325 carefully-selected MERIS full-resolution (300-m) scenes between 2003 and 2012, with pixels of extreme turbidity (NGRDI < 0.06, corresponding to >similar to 25 mg.L-1 total suspended sediments or TSS) masked. The long-term Chl-a distribution showed significant spatial gradient and temporal variability, with Chl-a ranging between 2.4 +/- 0.2 mg.m(-3) in April and 4.4 +/- 1.0 mg.m(-3) in July and no significant increasing or decreasing trend during the 10-year period. In waters where Chl-a was retrievable (i.e., where TSS is < 25 mg.L-1), Chl-a concentration indicated a significant negative correlation with TSS concentration on a seasonal scale and a significant positive correlation with precipitation over the years. Potential eutrophic regions in the southern and eastern lake, thought to be results of limited water exchange with the main lake, were delineated based on the occurrence frequency of high Chl-a (>10 mg.m(-3)) in summer. The study not only provides, for the first time, synoptic baseline information on the lake's Chl-a distributions and potential eutrophic regions, but also demonstrates a practical approach that might be extended to assess eutrophication conditions in other inland waters.

J	Ebi, KL; Woodruff, R; von Hildebrand, A; Corvalan, C				Ebi, Kristie L.; Woodruff, Rosalie; von Hildebrand, Alexander; Corvalan, Carlos			Climate change-related health impacts in the Hindu Kush-Himalayas	ECOHEALTH												Our goal was to identify the climate change-related health risks and vulnerable populations specific to the mountainous regions of the Hindu Kush-Himalayas. We reviewed published information of the likely health consequences of climate change in mountain regions, especially the findings of a workshop for countries in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya region, organized by the World Health Organization, World Meteorological Organization, United Nations Environment Programme, and United Nations Development Programme. The main climate-related risks in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya region include the expansion of vector-borne diseases as pathogens take advantage of new habitats in altitudes that were formerly unsuitable. Diarrheal diseases could become more prevalent with changes in freshwater quality and availability. More extreme rainfall events are likely to increase the number of floods and landslides with consequent death and injuries. A unique risk is sudden floods from high glacier lakes, which cause substantial destruction and loss of life. Because glaciers are the main source of freshwater for upland regions and downstream countries, the long-term reduction in annual glacier snowmelt is expected to heighten existing water insecurity in these areas. Climate change also is bringing some benefits to mountain populations, including milder winters and longer growing seasons. Populations in mountain regions have unique combinations of vulnerabilities to climate change. The extent of the health impacts experienced will depend on the effectiveness of public health efforts to identify and implement low-cost preparedness and response measures, and on the speed at which emissions of greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced.

However, recent discoveries at the littoral of Bulgaria and Israel suggest that there may be numerous coastal settlements submerged under water in Turkey as well. The settlements of Simena, Theimussa and Aperlai in the vicinity of Kekova Island (Dolichiste) of Antalya are partially under water, and through touristic promotion they have been recognized for decades. In the course of underwater surveys conducted in the summer months of 2015, a harbour mole datable to the Hellenistic period and structures datable to the Roman period have been identified in Beymelek Lake. The present article deals with these structures now under water and explores what caused them to become submerged.

THERMAL CHARACTERISTICS OF STORMWATER RUNOFF FROM ASPHALT AND SOD SURFACES	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Urban impervious surfaces absorb and store thermal energy, particularly during warm summer months. During a rainfall/runoff event, thermal energy is transferred from the impervious surface to the runoff, causing it to become warmer. As this higher temperature runoff enters receiving waters, it can be harmful to coldwater habitat. In an urban watershed, impervious asphalt surfaces (roads, parking lots, and driveways) and pervious residential lawns comprise a significant portion of the watershed area. A paired asphalt-turfgrass sod plot was constructed to compare the thermal runoff characteristics between asphalt and turfgrass sod surfaces, to identify meteorological variables that influence these thermal characteristics, and to evaluate evaporative heat loss for runoff from asphalt surfaces. Rainfall simulations were conducted during the summers of 2004 and 2005 under a range of climatic conditions. Asphalt surface temperatures immediately prior to rainfall simulations averaged 43.6 degrees C and decreased an average of 12.3 degrees C over 60 min as rain cooled the surface. In contrast, presimulation sod surface temperatures averaged only 23.3 degrees C and increased an average of 1.3 degrees C throughout the rainfall events. Heat transferred from the asphalt to the runoff resulted in initial asphalt runoff temperatures averaging 35.0 degrees C that decreased by an average of 4.1 degrees C at the end of the event. Sod runoff temperatures averaged only 25.5 degrees C and remained fairly constant throughout the simulations. Multivariable regression equations were developed to predict (1) average asphalt surface temperature (R(2) = 0.90) and average asphalt runoff temperature (R(2) = 0.92) as a function of solar radiation, rain temperature, and wind speed, and (2) average sod surface temperature (R(2) = 0.85)and average sod runoff temperature (R(2) = 0.94) as a function of solar radiation, rain temperature, rain intensity, and wind speed. Based on a heat balance analysis, existing evaporation equations developed from studies on lakes were not adequate to predict evaporation from runoff on a heated impervious surface. The combined heat from the asphalt and sod plots was an average of 38% less than the total heat had the total area consisted solely of asphalt.																			1093-474X					OCT	2008	44	5					1325	1336		10.1111/j.1752-1688.2008.00226.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2008.00226.x													WOS:000259865100021
J	Wiegand, MC; Piedra, JIG; de Araújo, JC				Wiegand, Mario Cesar; Gonzalez Piedra, Julio Ivan; de Araujo, Jose Carlos			Vulnerability towards eutrophication of two tropical lakes in both humid (Cuba) and semiarid (Brazil) climates	ENGENHARIA SANITARIA E AMBIENTAL												This manuscript compares the eutrophication status and its possible causes in two tropical reservoirs, one in humid climate (La Juventud, Cuba) and the other in semi-arid climate (Marengo, Brazil). After estimating the trophic state of the two reservoirs in rainy and dry seasons, we evaluated the influence of hydrology and of land use on reservoir trophic level. It was found that the semi-arid tropical reservoir was eutrophic, while the reservoir on humid climate was mesotrophic. Considering that there is similar land use in the two basins and that, in the rainy season, the nutrient input in the wet basin is considerably higher than the nutrient input in the semiarid basin, the higher trophic state of the semi-arid basin is surprising. The variable that best explains this phenomenon is the water residence time, which directly influences the phosphorus residence time in the reservoir. The high water residence time in the semiarid basin reservoir (three times that of the reservoir in humid climate) is due as much to the low runoff coefficient (93 versus 595 mm per year in the reservoir in humid climate) as to the excessive water evaporation in the semiarid reservoir (1.2 times that of the reservoir in humid climate). These results indicate that semiarid reservoirs are more vulnerable to eutrophication than reservoirs in humid climate in summer periods and, therefore, the management of their basins should be more restrictive to nutrient production.					de Araujo, Jose Carlos/J-9629-2012; de Araújo, José/J-9629-2012	de Araujo, Jose Carlos/0000-0002-2649-151X; 													1413-4152	1809-4457				APR-JUN	2016	21	2					415	424		10.1590/S1413-41522016139527	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1413-41522016139527													WOS:000380826000020

In the chaparral there is an apparent shortage of palatable browse, but at Hopland there is little opportunity for competition between deer and sheep in chaparral types because sheep spend little time in chaparral. In fall, there may be some competition for the green forage that is in short supply. Food habits of deer and sheep are complementary on oak woodland ranges, and dual stocking makes more efficient use of all forage than would exclusive use by either class of stock.

The study site on the NAR was 32 km below Lake Anna, a surface-release reservoir. H. curiosum was bivoltine in both rivers with 2 summer generations and probable overwintering in the egg stage. It passed through 10 larval instars (range 9-12) in both rivers. The density of larvae was twice as great in the SAR as the NAR. Factors which probably contributed to the lesser success of H. curiosum in the NAR included bottom scouring produced by sudden increases in discharge, absence of the macrophyte Podostemum, quality of available food and alterations of the temperature regime. Of these 4 factors, temperature probably had the most significant effect. The emergence of the 2nd generation was 1 mo. later in the NAR because the reservoir delayed the normal seasonal cooling of the river. The nonoptimal temperature regime significantly reduced the fecundity of H. curiosum in the NAR. Data indicate that surface-release reservoirs may have subtle but significant effects on the life histories of benthic macroinvertebrates.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1981	59	2					305	314		10.1139/z81-046	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z81-046													WOS:A1981LE66100020
J	Kerfoot, WC				Kerfoot, W. Charles			Baltic Eubosmina morphological radiation:: Sensitivity to invertebrate predators (induction) and observations on genetic differences	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Cladocerans in the genus Eubosmina exhibit spectacular and confusing morphological diversification in the Baltic region. The paleolimnological record suggests that lineages in regional lakes diverged recently from morphologically conservative E. longispina/coregoni-like ancestors and developed strong seasonal elongation of antennules, mucrones, or dorsal humps (cyclomorphosis). Allozyme studies on Schleswig-Holstein populations by DE MELO agree with this interpretation by demonstrating: 1) genetic difference between geographically distant E. longispina populations, 2) clustering of E. coregoni forms with local E. longispina lineages, and 3) great genetic similarity among regional E. coregoni forms, despite major morphological differences. Retention of distinguishing traits (shape of dorsal humps, antennule length) in common-garden experiments emphasizes that micro-evolutionary (genetic) differences underlie "form" phenotypes. However, regression of extreme summer forms towards a more conservative morphology in laboratory culture indicates that part of the seasonal variability is attributable to developmental plasticity. Split-clone laboratory experiments demonstrate that longer antennule lengths of an exuberant form, E. coregoni kessleri from the Grosser Ploner See, are increased (induced) in the presence of predatory cyclopoids. Induction responses strengthen the notion that long-term transformations involve evolutionary responses to invertebrate predators (cyclopoid copepods, Leptodora) which colonized large lakes during post-glacial periods, with the particulars of responses showing lineage and lake specificity.																			0003-9136					SEP	2006	167	1-4					147	168		10.1127/0003-9136/2006/0167-0147	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2006/0167-0147													WOS:000241402800011

The concentrations of DGM measured in these waters (mean 7.3 +/- 9.5 pg l(-1)) are among the lowest reported in the literature, and suggest a system often near or slightly above equilibrium with Kg in ambient air. DGM exhibited both seasonal and diel trends, peaking at midday and during the summer. A simple box budget model of DGM in waters of the Everglades was developed using an interactive spreadsheet based on a mass balance among light-induced reduction of Hg-II (production of DGM), Hg-0 oxidation (removal), and Hg-0 evasion in a box (water column) consisting of a surface region with sunlight available and a lower dark region. The modeling results suggest high sensitivity of hourly DGM concentrations to DGM production rates and initial DGM levels. The sensitivity to Hg oxidation is lower than the sensitivity to DGM production. The model performance demonstrates successful simulations of a variety of DGM trends in the Everglades. In particular, it clearly demonstrates how it is possible to measure comparable rates of evasion over several Everglades sites with different DGM concentrations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The energetic effects (measured as oxygen uptake) of acute eye fluke infection on S. alpinus were negligible, but in the chronic infections mean oxygen consumption of infected fish was significantly higher than that of controls. Feeding capability of S. alpinus was studied in aquarium experiments, and uninfected healthy-eyed fish reacted to zooplankton more rapidly and caught zooplankton with better success compared to individuals with cataracts in the same school. The results suggested that to compensate energetic costs and impaired feeding capability caused by eye fluke, cataract-bearing fish spend more time foraging, which may result in increased predation risk.

To monitor changes in Ohio's Lake Erie charter fishing industry, we surveyed a random sample of 319 licensed Ohio charter captains by mail in the spring of 1999 for data from the 1998 charter season. The Ohio charter industry grew rapidly in the 1980s, peaked at 1,211 captains in 1990, and stood at 958 in 1998 despite large declines in angling effort and fish harvest of sport species. It is a marginal economic enterprise for the individual charter firm; almost 40% of Ohio captains struggle with their cash flow. Only those captains making 41 or more trips (31%) had a substantial average net profit ($5,576). Almost 93% of responding captains have modified their fishing practices due to increased water clarity in Lake Erie and 27% have added nonfishing charters to their mix of services. In 1998, the top rated concerns of the responding captains were illegal fishing practices, poor weather conditions, and business cost factors. Our 1998 survey shows that the Ohio Lake Erie charter industry continues to provide anglers ample opportunity for a great Lake Erie fishing experience. However, captains need to look for ways to expand the potential charter client pool to improve the viability of the industry.

N, K, S and Mg contents in leaves and roots were of the same order of magnitude. whereas trace-element concentrations in roots were at least one order of magnitude higher than in leaves and increased with ageing, the maximum values being recorded in winter, at the end of the life cycle. N and K concentrations fluctuated during the seasonal cycle. with the highest values recorded during the phase of vegetative activity of the plants, whilst S and Mg contents showed no seasonal variation. Sediment roots, arising from the lower, chlorophyll-less parts of the culms and growing in the bottom sediments, were distinct from water roots, emerging from the green parts of the culms and floating in water, for their particularly prominent aerenchyma, a feature probably related to oxygen limitation. The two root types showed a different capacity to accumulate macro and trace elements. The results confirm P. australis as a particularly suitable plant for phytoremediation of polluted wetlands.

During episodes, concentration changes in ions which contributed to alkalinity decreases were partially offset by smaller changes in other ions which contributed to alkalinity increases. The major contributor to alkalinity depressions was base cation dilution by snowmelt water. Alkalinity depressions were more likely to be dominated by SO42- increases in streams that were more acidic. Neither nitrate nor organic acid anions were significant contributors to alkalinity depressions. Discharge was highly correlated with alkalinity in a circumneutral stream but not in an acidic stream and is consistent with dilution being less important as a cause of alkalinity depressions as streams become more acidic.

Does global warming favour the occurrence of extreme floods in European Alps? First evidences from a NW Alps proglacial lake sediment record	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Flood hazard is expected to increase in the context of global warming. However, long time-series of climate and gauge data at high-elevation are too sparse to assess reliably the rate of recurrence of such events in mountain areas. Here paleolimnological techniques were used to assess the evolution of frequency and magnitude of flash flood events in the North-western European Alps since the Little Ice Age (LIA). The aim was to document a possible effect of the post-19(th) century global warming on torrential floods frequency and magnitude. Altogether 56 flood deposits were detected from grain size and geochemical measurements performed on gravity cores taken in the proglacial Lake Blanc (2170 m a.s.l., Belledonne Massif, NW French Alps). The age model relies on radiometric dating (Cs-137 and Am-241), historic lead contamination and the correlation of major flood- and earthquake-triggered deposits, with recognized occurrences in historical written archives. The resulting flood calendar spans the last ca 270 years (AD 1740-AD 2007). The magnitude of flood events was inferred from the accumulated sediment mass per flood event and compared with reconstructed or homogenized datasets of precipitation, temperature and glacier variations. Whereas the decennial flood frequency seems to be independent of seasonal precipitation, a relationship with summer temperature fluctuations can be observed at decadal timescales. Most of the extreme flood events took place since the beginning of the 20(th) century with the strongest occurring in 2005. Our record thus suggests climate warming is favouring the occurrence of high magnitude torrential flood events in high-altitude catchments.

This means that saline intrusion should be monitored to manage the irrigated rice-growing area. The aim of this study therefore is to develop a model to estimate the salinity of river water using satellite imagery. The imagery of Sentinel-2 was suitable for monitoring saline intrusion because of their high spatial (10-m) and temporal (10-day) resolutions. We found that the reflectance of the visible bands was correlated with electrical conductivity, which was influenced by the concentration and composition of dissolved salts. When the river water mixed with the salt water from the sea, suspended particles tended to flocculate and settle, as a result, less turbid water was more saline. The best-fitting model was obtained with the green band (coefficient of determination R-2 of 0.776, root mean square error of 4.896 dSm(-1), and mean absolute error of 3.340 dS m(-1)). The saline intrusion showed considerable spatial and temporal variability during the dry season. The salinity intrusion extended approximately 80 km inland at the end of the dry season in March in the Pathein River. The 1 ppt salt concentration line in March marked the boundary between cultivated and non-cultivated areas of paddy field, which indicates that cultivable areas were strongly affected by saline intrusion. The results show that more frequent and higher resolution monitoring than before of the Sentinel-2 can support effective water resource management.																			1611-2490	1611-2504				APR	2021	19	2			SI		283	294		10.1007/s10333-020-00837-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10333-020-00837-0		JAN 2021											WOS:000604820000001

However, most have focused on the sources of pollutants and their characteristics and distribution. Although the location of the city subjects it to unavoidable natural conditions where air pollution accumulates during the cold season, nature-based solutions have not yet been considered in the projects implemented to mitigate air pollution levels. Therefore, this study aims to determine the combined influence of geography and atmospheric factors on cold season air pollution. The spatiotemporal variations in the variables were investigated using meteorological observation data from 1991 to 2020 in the different land-use areas. Then, atmospheric stagnation conditions and air pollution potential parameters were estimated from daily radiosonde data. Subsequently, the temporal variations in air pollutants were studied and correlated with estimates of the above parameters. In the Ulaanbaatar depression, the stable cold air lake (colder than -13.5 degrees C), windless (34-66% of all observations), and poor turbulent mixing conditions were formed under the near-surface temperature inversion layer in the cold season. Moreover, due to the mountain topography, the winds toward the city center from all sides cause polluted air to accumulate in the city center for long periods. Air pollution potential was categorized as very high and high (<4000 m(2)center dot s(-1)), in the city in winter, indicating the worst air quality. Thus, further urban planning policy should consider these nature factors.

Plant and animal remains including insects found in laminated sand and mud indicate deposition in a lake surrounded by dwarf shrubs, herbs, mosses and rare trees. The insect fauna indicates a mean July temperature of 8-12 degrees C, suggesting an arctic to sub-arctic environment, while winter temperatures around -8 to -22 degrees C suggest periglacial conditions with permafrost. Luminescence dating of sediment samples gave ages from 48-29ka, and radiocarbon dating indicates deposition of plant fragments between 45 and 36ka BP.

Genetic diversity of cyanobacteria in four eutrophic lakes	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Recent studies indicate genetic diversity of cyanobacteria in eutrophic lakes is not represented well by culture collections or morphology. Yet, few studies have investigated genetic richness and evenness of cyanobacteria using culture-independent methods. We compared the genetic structure of cyanobacteria supported by four neighboring eutrophic lakes during the ice-free season. The partial phycobilincpcB/A genes plus intergenic spacer (PC-IGS) was used as a genetic marker. Sequences were phylogeneticallygrouped by maximum likelihood into genotypes representing sub-genera of the major taxa. Genotypes fell into genera commonly observed by microscopy in these lakes including Microcystis, Aphanizomenon, Chroococcus, Anabaena, and Cylindrospermopsis. Only three genotypes were shared among all four lakes, despite significant water flowage between lakes. A Parsimony P-test indicated lakes were significantly (p = 0.01) clustered on the maximum likelihood tree. Pairwise differences using Unifrac distance were moderately or not significant. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated genetic variation among all genotypes (phi = 0.06, p < 0.001) and 94% of variability occurred within lakes rather than between lakes (6%), explaining the lack of pairwise differences between lakes. Lorenze curves of genotype abundance in each lake showed genetic structure was only moderately uneven (Gini coefficients of 0.37-0.5) indicating lakes did not support dominant genotypes. Overall, results from this study suggest diversity of cyanobacteria is shaped by heterogeneity within lakes (temporally or spatially) and relatively even population structures.

Downstream Evolution and Coastal-to-Inland Transition of Landfalling Lake-Effect Systems	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												The distribution and intensity of lake- and sea-effect (hereafter lake-effect) precipitation are strongly influenced by the mode of landfalling lake-effect systems. Here, we used idealized large-eddy simulations to investigate the downstream evolution and coastal-to-inland transition of two lake-effect modes: 1) a long-lake-axis-parallel (LLAP) band generated by an oval body of water (hereafter lake; e.g., Lake Ontario) and 2) broad-coverage, open-cell convection generated by an open lake (e.g., Sea of Japan). Under identical atmospheric conditions and lake-surface temperatures, the oval lake generates a LLAP band with heavy precipitation along the midlake axis, whereas the open lake generates broad-coverage, open-cell convection with widespread, light accumulations. Over the oval lake, the LLAP band features a thermally forced and diabatically enhanced cross-band secondary circulation with convergence and ascent over the midlake axis. Downstream of the lake, flanking airstreams that avoid lake modification merge beneath the band where they experience sublimational cooling, producing a cold pool. At the upstream edge of the cold pool, a coastal baroclinic zone forms. Above this zone, ascent and hydrometeor mass growth are maximized, resulting in an inland precipitation maximum due to subsequent hydrometeor transport and fallout. Over the open lake, individual open cells grow larger and stronger with overwater extent, but a convective-to-stratiform transition begins at the coast. Here, convective vigor decays, mesoscale ascent begins, and enhanced hydrometeor growth results in an inland precipitation maximum. These results highlight variations in the coastal-to-inland transition of lake-effect systems that ultimately influence the distribution and intensity of lake-effect precipitation. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Lake-effect snow impacts many urban and rural communities, disrupting transportation and commerce, but benefiting regional winter-sports economies. Using high-resolution computer modeling with simple lake shapes, we simulated two common types of landfalling lake-effect storms: 1) intense bands that sometimes produce extreme but highly localized snowfall and 2) scattered cells that typically generate widespread lake-effect snow showers. Our analysis describes how these distinct storms transform as they move inland, affecting the distribution and intensity of snowfall over downstream communities. Knowledge of this transformation is important for understanding lake-effect storms and improving forecasts of lake-effect snowfall.					; Minder, Justin/K-5813-2017	Steenburgh, Jim/0000-0003-1028-4230; Minder, Justin/0000-0001-7182-7898; 													0027-0644	1520-0493				APR	2021	149	4					1023	1040		10.1175/MWR-D-20-0253.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-20-0253.1													WOS:000644295700007

Life outside the fishbowl: Tracking an introduced population of goldfish (Carassius auratus) in an embayment on the Laurentian Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Invasive species are a key threat to biodiversity in freshwater ecosystems; and, as such, their management can be an important part of ecosystem restoration and conservation. In Hamilton Harbour, an impaired Lake Ontario embayment, invasive species are an important threat. In the early 2000s, an increase in invasive goldfish (Carassius auratus) was identified during monitoring surveys. This population of goldfish was studied via acoustic telemetry to gain knowledge about its biology to support management control options. Hamilton Harbour goldfish exhibited seasonal patterns in site and depth use, and clear preferences for over -wintering and spawning areas. Goldfish were largely resident to Hamilton Harbour with the exception of one individual. To predict when goldfish would move into spawning areas, we examined goldfish presence, abundance, and temperature at a fishbarrier connected to the harbour and developed models to predict goldfish presence based on Cumulative Growing Degree Days (CGDD) and Day of Year (DOY). Goldfish were captured in large numbers (>100 day( -1)) at the fishway when CGDD > 25.0 and DOY > 100; therefore, we predicted that our tagged fish would move to spawning areas when these thresholds were reached. Both models accurately predicted when tagged fish moved to spawning areas which largely occurred when water temperatures were lower (>= 9.7 C) than thresholds previously identified in the literature (i.e., 15.0 C - 22.0 C). This suggested that pre-spawn/staging behaviour was detected using telemetry driven by factors including water temperature. Results from this work will inform control strategies for goldfish, including active removal during aggregation prior to spawning.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; Larocque, Sarah/0000-0002-2088-4988; 													0380-1330					FEB	2024	50	1							102253	10.1016/j.jglr.2023.102253	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2023.102253		JAN 2024											WOS:001171327200001

Protists, especially heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF), consume most of bacterial production (50-100 %) in all 3 reservoirs over an annual cycle, except for the short clear-water phase. However, with increasing trophy of the systems, ciliates become as important bacterivores as HNF. Despite large differences in reservoirs characteristics, basically the same taxonomic groups of HNF (chrysomonads, bodonids and choanoflagellates) and ciliates (small oligotrichs dominated by Halteria grandinella, vorticellids and scuticociliates) were found to be the principal bacterioplankton consumers.

Modeling hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen depletion using monitoring data	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Eutrophication increases hypoxia in lakes and reservoirs, causing deleterious effects on biological communities. Quantitative models would help managers develop effective strategies to address hypoxia issues, but most existing models are limited in their applicability to lakes with temporally resolved dissolved oxygen data. We describe a hierarchical Bayesian model that predicts dissolved oxygen in lakes based on a mechanistic understanding of the factors that influence the development of hypoxia during summer stratification. These factors include the days elapsed since stratification, dissolved organic carbon concentration, lake depth, and chlorophyll concentration. We demonstrate that the model can be fit to two datasets: one in which temporally resolved dissolved oxygen profiles were collected from 20 lakes in a single state and one in which single profiles were collected from 381 lakes across the United States. Analyses of these two datasets yielded similar relationships between volumetric oxygen demand and chlorophyll concentration, suggesting that the model structure appropriately represented the effects of eutrophication on oxygen depletion. Combining both datasets in a single model further improved the precision of predictions.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAY	2020	77	5					814	823		10.1139/cjfas-2019-0294	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2019-0294								32461710					WOS:000529378700003
J	Villani, JP; Jurewicz, ML; Reinhold, K				Villani, Joseph P.; Jurewicz, Michael L., Sr.; Reinhold, Karin			Forecasting the Inland Extent of Lake Effect Snow Bands Downwind of Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL METEOROLOGY												Determining the inland extent (IE) of lake effect snow (LES) is an ongoing operational forecasting challenge at the Albany and Binghamton National Weather Service (NWS) forecast offices, and several other NWS forecast offices in the Great Lakes region. Assuming favorable conditions for development of LES, determining how far inland snow bands will extend is critical to forecasters making decisions supporting the NWS watch/warning/advisory program and resulting impact-based decision support services. This research sought to identify which atmospheric parameters commonly have the greatest influence on how far inland LES bands travel, and to develop forecasting techniques to assist meteorologists. Single band LES events for the 2006-2009 winter seasons were examined downwind of Lake Ontario. The IE of LES bands was measured over the duration of each event and broken into quartiles. The quartiles were used to create categories for IE (short, moderate, and long). Several parameters were analyzed, using statistical correlations at data points within, and just outside of, LES bands. Box-and-whiskers plots were constructed for individual parameters relative to each IE category. The most strongly correlated parameters to IE included existence of a multi-lake/upstream moisture source connection (MLC), mixed-layer (ML) stability (represented by lake-air temperature differentials), 0-1-km bulk shear, and mean ML wind speed. LES bands featuring an MLC showed a greater tendency to progress farther inland, compared to those without. A predictive equation for forecasting IE of LES downwind of Lake Ontario was developed from a statistical model using a stepwise and backwards selection algorithm. A crossvalidation method was used to determine skill.																			2325-6184					MAY 31	2017	5	5					53	70		10.15191/nwajom.2017.0505	http://dx.doi.org/10.15191/nwajom.2017.0505													WOS:000405278000001
J	Sun, TL; Yao, SX; Huang, Q; Guo, Q; Xia, YC; Zhang, HM				Sun, Tianle; Yao, Suxiang; Huang, Qian; Guo, Qu; Xia, Yicong; Zhang, Hongmei			Possible mechanism of the mid-high-latitude synoptic-scale disturbances impact on Meiyu precipitation anomalies	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												Precipitation during the Meiyu period in East Asia demonstrated a tendency towards increased frequency of rainstorms and escalating disaster-causing potential, exhibiting significant inter-annual variations in recent years. The relationship between Meiyu precipitation (MP) anomalies, related circulation anomalies and mid-high-latitude synoptic-scale disturbances was investigated by observation and reanalysis data from 1979 to 2018 and the regional climate model (RegCM4.6). Based on the observation results, the physical mechanism of disturbance affecting MP was proposed and verified by numerical simulation experiments. The results show that, during the Meiyu periods, the variation of synoptic-scale disturbances over Lake Baikal correlates negatively with MP anomalies, where the abnormal zonal winds and the disturbance anomalies show a strong spatially consistent coherence in the upper troposphere. Compared to drought years, the weaker conversion of disturbance energy to mean flow and the convergence of anomalous Eliassen-Palm (E-P) flux induce mid-high-latitude anomalous easterly flow during the Meiyu period in flood years. The occurrence of such conditions leads to the southward shift of the East-Asian subtropical jet (STJ). Then, anomalous stronger ascending flow over the Meiyu region finally results in stronger MP. In addition, warm temperature anomaly and warm advection anomaly exist at lower latitudes in flood years, while mid-high latitudes exhibit cold temperature anomaly and cold advection anomaly, which is conducive to the southward shift of the East-Asian STJ and the increase of MP. Based on the above diagnosis, sensitivity experiments were conducted using RegCM4.6. When the mid-high-latitude synoptic-scale disturbances are amplified during flood years or flood decades, the MP correspondingly decreases, and vice versa. The simulation results also show that the convergence (divergence) of mid-high-latitude E-P flux results in a weakening (strengthening) of the westerly flow, which leads to the southward (northward) shift of the East-Asian STJ. The alteration of the STJ's position in East Asia alters the position of the ascending branch of the vertical meridional circulation corresponding to the jet stream, subsequently impacting MP. Therefore, both diagnosis and numerical simulation reveal the possible mechanism of synoptic disturbances in mid-high latitude affecting MP in Yangtze River Basin, thus enriching the study of MP anomaly mechanism during Meiyu period.					xia, yc/LMP-5351-2024														0169-8095	1873-2895				MAR	2024	298								107137	10.1016/j.atmosres.2023.107137	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2023.107137		DEC 2023											WOS:001135495600001

Attempts to monitor these black water blooms have not been successful due to their irregular nature. In May 2012, two black water blooms were observed in one of the lake's eutrophic bays. The bio-optical analyses of these blooms show that they were dominated by higher concentrations of dissolved organic matter and lower backscattering coefficients with respect to the surrounding lake conditions. We show the contribution of each optically active component to the perceived radiance and demonstrate that elevated absorption due to dissolved organic matter and phytoplankton combined with reduced backscattering led to the perception of these water areas as ''black", while the true color was dark green.

J	Kornijow, R				Kornijow, R			Cumulative consumption of the lake macrophyte Elodea by abundant generalist invertebrate herbivores	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Previous investigations have shown that macrophyte biomass call be substantially reduced by invertebrate herbivores but have not provided evidence for the links between the magnitude of the observed damage and the densities of herbivores. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the abundant occurrence of the epiphytic generalist herbivores may result in their cumulative consumption which, in turn, can be regarded as the mechanism responsible for often observed relatively high level of herbivory on freshwater macrophytes. The percentage of Elodea sp. biomass consumed by invertebrates was estimated for six European lakes, based on analysis of gut contents, daily rations and the density of epiphytic herbivores. Although the daily ration of these invertebrates when feeding upon Elodea averaged only 14.6% of their dry mass, their biomass was relatively high (from 0.163 to 1.161 g DW per 100 g DW plant). The estimated percentage oi Elodea biomass consumed during one summer month by epiphytic invertebrates ranged from 0.5 to 5.9%. These values, after extrapolating to the whole growing season would mean that the biomass of Elodea lost to herbivory was between about 2 and 23%, an estimate which are within the range of consumption reported by other authors.

J	Longstaff, TG				Longstaff, TG			An ecological reconnaissance in West Greenland	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												A pioneer ecological survey was made over 8 sq. miles in a climatically favorable part of the Godthaab district. Owing to the patchwork character of the vegetation it proved difficult to separate the animals and plants into definite communities, indicating that the marked zonation of the high arctic quickly breaks down at lower latitudes. Nevertheless an attempt is made to describe certain animal and plant communities. It is striking how little the animals fall into definite communities and how few habitats have exclusive species. For the study of animals in the field, the following subdivisions are employed: heath, willow scrub, rock domes, hummock flats, bog, pools, tarns, lakes, streams and shore-line. The diet of the commonest birds is described. A census was made of breeding pairs.																			0021-8790	1365-2656					1932	1						119	142		10.2307/974	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/974													WOS:000201317200013

Soils cool as climate warms in the great lakes region: 1951-2000	ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS												We modeled soil temperatures at 50-cm depth, using 1951-2000 air temperature and precipitation data from 194 National Weather Service stations in Wisconsin and Michigan. The accuracy and bias of the physical model used in this study were validated by comparing its output data to 22,401 actual soil temperature readings taken from sandy soils at thirty-nine forested sites throughout northern Michigan; the model was shown to have almost no temperature bias. Although mean annual air temperatures across the region show no strong spatial or temporal trends over the fifty-year period, at many sites, especially in Wisconsin, wintertime air temperatures have been increasing slightly in recent years. Conversely, mean annual soil temperatures have been decreasing at most sites in the region, some by more than 0.5 degrees C. Likewise, wintertime soil temperatures are also decreasing, especially at sites downwind from the Great Lakes-many of which are in snowbelt locations. Increasing wintertime air temperatures over the past fifty years coincide with (and probably have led to) more variable and thinner snowpacks, lessening their insulating impact and contributing to decreasing wintertime soil temperatures that our model show are occurring in the eastern and northern parts of the region. These findings illustrate the complex response of natural systems to slow atmospheric warming, and draw attention to the potential changes that are occurring in growing season characteristics, phenology, and spring runoff characteristics in the Great Lakes region.																			0004-5608	1467-8306				SEP	2007	97	3					467	476		10.1111/j.1467-8306.2007.00558.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8306.2007.00558.x													WOS:000249562400001

A 5500-year oxygen isotope record of high arctic environmental change from southern Spitsbergen	HOLOCENE												The oxygen isotope composition of chironomid head capsules in a sediment core spanning the past 5500 years from Lake Svartvatnet in southern Spitsbergen was used to reconstruct the oxygen isotope composition of lake water (O-18(lw)) and local precipitation. The O-18(lw) values display shifts from the baseline variability consistent with the timing of recognized historical climatic episodes, such as the Roman Warm Period, the Dark Ages Cold Period and the Little Ice Age'. The highest values of the record, ca. 3 parts per thousand above modern O-18(lw) values, occur at ca. 1900-1800 cal. yr BP. Three negative excursions increasing in intensity toward the present, at 3400-3200, 1250-1100, and 350-50 cal. yr BP, are tentatively linked to roughly synchronous episodes of increased glacier activity and general cold spells around the northern North Atlantic. Their manifestation in the Svartvatnet O-18(lw) record not only testify to the sensitivity and potential of high Arctic lacustrine O-18(chir) records in tracking terrestrial climate evolution but also highlight nonlinear dynamics within the northern North Atlantic hydroclimatic system. The Little Ice Age' period at 350-50 cal. yr BP displays a remarkable 8-9 parts per thousand drop in O-18(lw) values, construed to predominantly represent significantly decreased winter temperatures during a period of increased seasonal differences and extended sea ice cover inducing changes in moisture source regions.

J	Velle, G; Larsen, J; Eide, W; Peglar, SM; Birks, HJB				Velle, G; Larsen, J; Eide, W; Peglar, SM; Birks, HJB			Holocene environmental history and climate of Ratasjoen, a low-alpine lake in south-central Norway	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The Holocene environmental history and climate are reconstructed for Ratasjoen, a low- alpine lake in south-central Norway. The reconstructions are based on chironomids, diatoms, pollen, plant macrofossils, and sediment characteristics. From plant macrofossil evidence, birch trees (Betula pubescens) immigrated ca. 10,000 cal BP. The chironomid-inferred mean July air temperature was high, but may be unreliable during the early stages of the lake's history due to the high abundance of Chironomus anthracinus type, a taxon that may include several species. From ca. 9000 cal BP the inferred mean July temperature was lower (ca. 9 degreesC). Temperatures increased towards 8000 cal BP and pine ( Pinus sylvestris) reached its upper limit near the lake. July temperature may have become a significant factor controlling long-term pH in the lake, starting shortly after 8000 cal BP. High pH values were associated with periods of warm summers and lower pH values occurred during periods of colder summers. Alkalinity processes within the lake and/or the catchment are possible factors controlling this relationship. A temperature decline at ca. 5400 cal BP separated two 10.6 degreesC temperature maxima around 6400 and 4500 cal BP. The 1.5 degreesC decline in July air temperatures from ca. 4400 cal BP was paralleled by a decrease of pH from 7.2 to 6.8. Following the temperature drop, first pine and then birch trees declined and disappeared from the catchment and organic accumulation in the lake increased. The increased organic accumulation rate had a positive effect on diatom production. At ca. 2700 cal BP the temperature reached a minimum (ca. 9.2 degreesC) and correspondingly a second pH minimum was reached. Temperature decreased again slightly at ca. 400 cal BP during the 'Little Ice Age', before increasing by about 0.5 degreesC towards the present. Percentage organic carbon as estimated by loss-on-ignition appears to be better correlated with chironomid-inferred July temperatures than organic accumulation rates, at least for the last 9000 years. Accumulation rates of organic sediments are more coupled with catchment-related processes, such as erosion and major changes in vegetation, than is percentage organic carbon.

J	Rowe, L; Gibson, D; Landis, DA; Isaacs, R				Rowe, Logan; Gibson, Dan; Landis, Douglas A.; Isaacs, Rufus			Wild bees and natural enemies prefer similar flower species and respond to similar plant traits	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												Designing wildflower habitats to support beneficial insects providing pollination and pest control services is important for supporting sustainable crop production. It is often desirable to support both groups of insects, making the selection of resource plants for insect conservation programs more challenging. Moreover, the process of selecting resource plants is complicated by the array of possible options in each region, and the need to provide resources over the entire growing season. Identifying traits shared by resource plants that are attractive to both bees and natural enemies can reduce the need to evaluate new plants in each region, by providing a guide for the types of plants expected to be rewarding to these insects. Using insect visitation data collected from replicated common garden plantings of native wildflower and shrub species from the Great Lakes region of the United States, we found a high degree of correlation between the abundance of bees and natural enemies visiting native plant species. These results were used to identify a set of 15 plant species that can provide resources for these insects throughout the summer. Across all tested species, pollen quantity per flower and the week of bloom were positively correlated with some, but not all, taxonomic groupings of beneficial insects. In contrast, floral area was consistently positively associated with visitation of both natural enemies and wild bees. This trait is easy to document and can allow for efficient local testing of potential resource plants, providing a faster path to implementing insect conservation in working landscapes.

J	Smith, JT; Appleby, PG; Hilton, J; Richardson, N				Smith, JT; Appleby, PG; Hilton, J; Richardson, N			Inventories and fluxes of Pb-210, Cs-137 and Am-241 determined from the soils of three small catchments in Cumbria, UK	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY												Inventories and vertical profiles of fall-out Pb-210, Cs-137 (both weapons test and Chernobyl) and Am-241 (a decay product of Pu-241) have been measured in the soils of three catchments in Cumbria, UK. Soil types varied from mineral soils to highly organic peat bog. The Pb-210 inventor ies in different cores from the same catchment were relatively uniform, the standard deviation of measurements being around 30%. Mean annual fluxes of Pb-210 calculated from the soil inventories were 63 Bq m(-2) year(-1) (Brotherswater catchment), 63 Bq m(-2) year(-1) (Blelham Tarn catchment, and 97 Bq m(-2) year(-1) (Devoke Water catchment) per metre of rainfall. From these and earlier data published in the literature, the mean UK Pb-210 flux is estimated to be 77 +/- 14 Bq m(-2) year(-1) per metre of rainfall. Inventor ies of Cs-137 (weapons test and Chernobyl) were more variable, but mean values for each of the catchments were in agreement with independent studies. The mean weapons test deposition (decay corrected to 1986) was 2790 Bq m(-2) per metre of rainfall, con?par ed to a UK aver age of 3160 Bg m(-2) derived from extensive national surveys. Although Am-241 levels in Brotherswater soils were comparable with those expected from weapons test fall-out, significantly higher values were recorded at Blelham Tarn and Devoke Water. Well-resolved peaks in Am-241 activity some distance below the present surface suggest that this radionuclide is relatively immobile within the soil column. The depth of penetration of 75% of the inventory into the soil column was similar for Pb-210, Cs-137 (weapons) and Am-241, all being significantly greater than Chernobyl(137)Cs. The vertical profiles of Cs-137 (weapons) suggest that there has been little mobility during the 15 years since a previous study (Cawse 1983). (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Liao, S; Huang, YS				Liao, Sian; Huang, Yongsong			Group 2i Isochrysidales flourishes at exceedingly low growth temperatures (0 to 6 °C)	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Group 2i Isochrysidales (Haptophyta) microalgae were recently suggested to be the main producer of the C37:4 alkenone in high latitude oceans with seasonal sea ice, enabling potential quantitative sea ice reconstructions using C37:4%. However, the conditions favoring the growth of Group 2i are currently unclear. Phylogenetically based on small subunit 18S rDNA sequence data, Group 2i is indistinguishable from OTU8 and Hap-A previously reported in numerous saline lakes around the world, and has been found to bloom in the early spring season in Lake George, North Dakota. These observations suggest Group 2i may have a preference for low growth tem-peratures and may grow within or underneath seasonal ice. Here we performed systematic culture experiments of Group 2i RCC5486 (isolated from sea ice of Baffin Bay) at exceedingly low temperatures (0, 3, 6, 9 degrees C at 31 ppt) and different salinities (15, 21, 26, 31, 38 ppt at 3 degrees C). We found Group 2i RCC5486 displays unusually fast growth from 0 to 6 degrees C, but failed to grow at 10.5 and 12 degrees C. These data confirm that Group 2i is explicitly adapted to low temperatures in both saline lakes and high latitude ocean regions (i.e., it is a psychrophile). Salinity, on the other hand, does not significantly influence the growth rates of Group 2i RCC5486. In addition, both growth temperature and salinity show minimal influence on C37:4%, which supports the use of C37:4% as a proxy for sea ice, rather than temperature or salinity in high latitude oceans.

The principle and components of the apparatus are presented. Using the proposed apparatus, the electrical resistance characteristics of air, ice, and water from 12 to -55 degrees C were studied in the laboratory. Field measurements using this apparatus were conducted in the Wanjiazhai Reservoir in the upper Yellow River for approximately four months during the winter of 2012-2013. The results showed that the recorded ice thickness agreed with the drill-hole measurements. The differences between the recorded and the drill-hole data are between 0 and 0.02 m. The new apparatus can continuously and automatically operate in freshwater ice. It provides an effective method for monitoring the ice thickness and temperature profiles in the air, ice and underlying water. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

John; Zhang, Enlou; Li, Yanling			Diatom response to climate forcing of a deep, alpine lake (Lugu Hu, Yunnan, SW China) during the Last Glacial Maximum and its implications for understanding regional monsoon variability	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Yunnan Plateau of southwest China is strongly influenced by the Asian monsoon and is a critical area in terms of determining its development and variability since the Last Glacial Maximum. High-resolution diatom analysis of a C-14-dated sediment core retrieved from Lugu Lake, Yunnan provides a detailed history of palaeoenvironment changes from 30,000 to 10,000 cal. yr BP. A model of climate diatom interactions (linking thermal stratification, ice cover and catchment-derived nutrients) is proposed to explain the observed changes. Prior to 24,500 cal. yr BP the dominance of the planktonic Cyclotella rhomboideo-elliptica indicates a period of stable stratification and low nutrient levels, with a moderate change of temperature and precipitation in the southwest monsoon region. During the LGM (24,500-14,500 cal. yr BP), the loss of the planktonic diatoms and a switch to small Fragilaria spp. suggest an altered thermal regime in the lake (i.e. weaker stratification and possibly ice cover). From similar to 18,000 cal. yr BP, the expansion of planktonic taxa (Stephanodiscus and the Asterionella formosa) and increased %TOC are indicative of increased nutrient availability reflecting altered vegetation and soil processes due to rising regional temperatures. After 14,500 cal. yr BP, a rapid reversal to dominance by planktonic diatoms indicates a further increase in temperature and continued development of catchment vegetation and soils. The abrupt changes in diatom species composition around 24,500 and 14,500 cal. yr BP suggest that the ecological status of the lake exceeded limnological thresholds. Interestingly, however, the Younger Dryas event is not clearly recognizable in either the diatom or pollen records in the Lugu Lake sediment record. In a partial redundancy analysis, 44.2% of the variability in the total diatom assemblages in the period 30,000-10,000 cal. yr BP was accounted for by changes in summer solar radiation.The relationships between the diatom assemblages and the C/N and pollen data are further evidence of climate catchment vegetation interactions and their impact on lake functioning. The composition of diatom assemblages in the Lugu Lake sediment core reflects direct and indirect (i.e. via catchment processes) climate forcing and in particular, the strength of the southwest monsoon, which in turn corresponds to orbitally-induced variability in Northern Hemisphere summer solar insolation from 30,000 cal. yr BP to 10,000 cal. yr BP.

Eighty-three polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners were targeted in the samples. The average gas and particle PCB concentrations were found as 393 +/- 278 and 70 +/- 102 pg/m(3), respectively, and 85% of the atmospheric PCBs were in the gas phase. Bulk deposition samples were collected by using a sampler made of stainless steel. The average PCB bulk deposition flux value was determined as 6,020 +/- 4,350 pg/m(2) day. The seasonal bulk deposition fluxes were not statistically different from each other, but the summer flux had higher values. Flux values differed depending on the precipitation levels. The average flux value in the rainy periods was 7,480 +/- 4,080 pg/m(2) day while the average flux value in dry periods was 5,550 +/- 4,420 pg/m(2) day. The obtained deposition values were lower than the reported values given for the urban and industrialized areas, yet close to the ones for the rural sites. The reported deposition values were also influenced by the type of the instruments used.

THE LITTLE ICE AGE IN THE TATRA MOUNTAINS	CUADERNOS DE INVESTIGACION GEOGRAFICA												The Little Ice Age (LIA) in the Tatras was characterized by both long and short rainy periods (mostly long cold rainy summers) alternated with warm periods that sometimes were very dry. Definite, precise identification of the onset and ending of the LIA in the Tatras is not possible. Depending on the criteria adopted, the limits of the actual onset and ending vary slightly. During the LIA in the Tatras, there were no fully developed glaciers, and only glacierettes were present. New rock glaciers had not formed while the existing ones did not show any activity. The LIA, in addition to the increased intensity of morphogenic processes, was also reflected in the lives of inhabitants of this part of the Carpathians. For humans the changes were very unfavourable because they were accompanied by a shortened vegetation period and crop yield deficiency that fostered the spread famine and various epidemics.

This collection is remarkable not only as one of the largest known assemblages of bone implements in northern Europe, but also in terms of diversity of forms. The most elaborately worked objects include harpoons, often with two rows of barbs and spade-shaped bases, which are believed to date to the Late Paleolithic, and to be among the oldest organic artifacts ever found in Latvia. Four broken specimens were sampled in 2011 for accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dating, stable isotope analysis, and taxonomic attribution by ZooMS. The results support the interpretation that these artifacts were made from large cervid bones, and date all four objects to the early Preboreal (mid-10th millennium cal BC). The Lake Lubans harpoons therefore fall in the same period as similar harpoons from Denmark, northern Germany, and Poland, although only a handful of these have been dated directly.					; Meadows, John/AAU-2326-2020	Meadows, John/0000-0002-4346-5591; Simpson, Joanna/0000-0002-0939-8487													0033-8222	1945-5755					2014	56	2					581	589		10.2458/56.16957	http://dx.doi.org/10.2458/56.16957													WOS:000335960600022

It survives in rivers, bays, lakes, and water reservoirs, and it is categorized as the fourth most common causative agent of CAP leading to hospitalization. We aimed to investigate patterns in which environmental, seasonal and regional factors may affect the prevalence of Legionnaires' disease in Crete during the last two decades (2000-2022).The data used originated from the national surveillance database and included any person reported with travel-associated Legionnaires' disease (TALD) between January 2000 and December 2022. Meteorological data were collected from the National Weather Service. The meteorological variables included (max) temperature (in degrees C), cloudiness (in octas), wind speed (in knots), and relative humidity (RH) (%). The statistical analysis was based on a case-crossover design with 1:1 matching characteristic. We revealed both seasonal and regional effects on the incidence of Legionnaires' disease. Cases are significantly more frequent in autumn, in comparison to the other three seasons, while Rethymnon is the prefecture with fewer cases in comparison to Chania or Heraklion. In addition, our research showed that the majority of cases occurred during the years 2017-2018. TALD in Crete is significantly associated with temperature in degrees C and wind speed in knots. Our research suggests that temporal and spatial factors significantly influence disease cases. These results are in line with studies from foreign countries. The study results aspire to expand our knowledge regarding the epidemiological characteristics of Legionnaires' disease in relation to local, geographical and meteorological factors on the island of Crete.

The cell size of the diatoms decreased gradually with the increase in cell abundance, indicating that the population underwent vegetative reproduction followed by sexual reproduction. The observation revealed two diatom blooms in a year. The autumn bloom from early October to late November was primarily dominated by A. granulata, A. ambigua f. japonica, and F. crotonensis. The minimum cell size of the diatoms recorded was 30, 20, and 75 mu m, respectively. F. crotonensis caused another bloom from late March to early May; the minimum cell size recorded was 68 mu m. These results suggested that F. crotonensis undergoes sexual reproduction twice a year, while the other two diatom species undergo sexual reproduction once a year. Correlation matrices and redundancy analysis were performed to explore the relationship of various environmental factors to cell size reduction and restoration of the seasonally dominant diatoms, and it is suggested that water temperature and/or concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen are critical environmental variables for seasonal changes in cell abundance and/or size of the dominant diatom species. Our results demonstrated that each diatom species had distinct favorable ecological conditions for staging its life cycle. We reported the effect of various environmental factors on the cell size change of the dominant diatoms, Aulacoseira ambigua, Aulacoseira granulata, and Fragilaria crotonensis, in Lake Biwa, to know diatoms' seasonal succession and sexual reproduction both of which we have only limited information.

NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL RADIOACTIVITY IN SOME PROTECTED AREAS OF SOUTH EAST EUROPE	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY & RADIATION PROTECTION												The primary aim of this research is the investigation of natural and artificial radioactivity in protected areas of Kopaonik, Vlasina, and Rila Mountains. Soil samples (including lake sediment), drinkable spring water and conifers at mentioned locations of Southeast Europe, are chosen as study objects due to their importance for people and the environment in global. Specific activities of Ra-226, Th-232, K-40, U-238, U-235, Cs-137, Pb-210, and Be-7 are determined using gamma spectrometry and the obtained values compared with literature and mean world values. Risk assessment parameters and the soil-plant transfer factor were determined for Ra-226, K-40, (CS)-C-137, and Pb-210. This is the first radioactivity study of high mountain areas of Vlasina and Kopaonik in Serbia and Rila in Bulgaria and as such a baseline measurement and foundation for future research.

Marvan et al. were cultured from two areas in Minnesota and North Dakota, USA. These isolates were identified to species level (when possible), using light microscopy and standard monographs and then characterized by 18S rDNA sequence analysis. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that in some cases, 18S rDNA sequences from these isolates were very similar, but not identical to the sequences of other isolates of the same morphospecies from different parts of the world. However, some isolates that were identified as the same species actually belong to different lineages within the Selenastraceae, whereas other isolates with identical or nearly identical 18S rDNA sequences possessed rather different morphologies. Overall, our data suggest that the application of a broad morphospecies concept to the Selenastraceae has resulted in an underestimation of the species diversity of this family and probably erroneous conclusions about the distribution of species.																			0022-3646					FEB	2006	42	1					142	154		10.1111/j.1529-8817.2006.00169.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2006.00169.x													WOS:000235220500016

THE IMPORTANCE OF COASTAL ROOKERIES IN THE LIFE OF THE BAIKAL SEAL (PUSA SIBIRICA GMELIN 1788, PINNIPEDIA). 4. BEHAVIOR OF SEALS ON COASTAL ROOKERIES OF TONKIY ISLAND USHKANYI ISLANDS, LAKE BAIKAL, BASED ON VIDEO OBSERVATIONS	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												A remote monitoring of the behavior of the Baikal seal was carried out for the first time on one of the main islands of the Uskanyi Archipelago, allowing for a large amount of video material to be obtained during and analyzed for four seasons (2012, 2014, 2018 and 2019). Summer and autumn nerpa rookeries on coastal territories are characterized as open anonymous communities devoid of hierarchical relations or other social forms of behavior, regardless of alarm warning. Thanks to video recordings, the patterns of nerpa arrival to the haulout area have been clarified, the ways the animals land are described, as well as the main elements of animal behavior revealed, both in comfortable (peaceful) conditions and in aggressive relations with their kin. A well-developed mimic has been noted, by means of which the nerpas express a variety of emotions. One of the strong emotions is irritation, which a nerpa shows in certain life situations (an occupied place on a stone or an unsuccessful attempt to climb a stone). This emotion is revealed in the form of unkind actions taken against "guilty" relatives, the most efficient of which is doising with water. The same way the nerpa makes the competitor to free up space in the haulout. Animals are generally reluctant to leave, on average spending about 3 hours per landing, while some animals occupying particularly advantageous positions on stones or boulders can spend an almost full light day in open air. However, many stones used seem uncomfortable for lying. During the day there is a partial renewal of the haulout composition ("rotation"), and the entire haulout is renewed in cases of panic. The behavior of frightened nerpas leaving the shore is described. Except for the humans, only seagulls are capable of spooking the nerpas from stones, but the nerpas are rather afraid of them and do not panic. Yet a case of a seagull attacking a nerpa is described. The main elements of a comfortable (peaceful) behavior include body care in the form of scouring different places of the body (mainly in relation to shedding, with a previously unknown method of scouring the back against a stone being described), sleep (rest), ways of maintaining an optimal body temperature in different conditions of lying on stones. Attention is paid to body pulling and yawning as ways for restoring an adequate blood supply to muscles after sleep and low mobility. Special attention is paid to aggressive behavior as a response to fear and cowardice experienced by animals. A great role played by individual behavior is emphasized, depending not so much on physical conditions, but rather on individual psychological performance. Observations of the behavior of the Baikal seal reveal that in the same life situations not all individuals show aggression, but if they do, they express it to a different degree. Large and strong individuals can be peace-loving, whereas weak ones can be aggressive. To the main known elements of aggressive behavior of the nerpa (lightning-fast head attacks towards the enemy, strikes with fins, doising with water etc.), biting can be added, used not only in attack, but also for protection. The concepts offight, quarrel, and pushing are distinguished. It is recognized that the Baikal seal is quite aggressive to the kin and can cause them small injuries, with a case of high-degree aggression of an animal virtually devoid of one eye being described. Important roles played by "touching", tapping and scouring the neighbors in the haulout during contacts on the lay, as well as various demonstrations during conflict pacification are noted. Pacifying, calming postures include head retraction (fear of the rival), turning away the head (or glance), and lifting and holding the head high. The latter two elements of behavior, in our view, demonstrate reluctance to continue the fight (i.e. peace-loving). An unusual element of nerpa behavior is described as a ritual "whose mustache is longer," the meaning of which is unclear, as well as the case of a seagull attacking a lone nerpa, when the bird pecked the nerpa's fin to remove it from the stone.					; Vladimir, Fialkov/AAD-4361-2022; Борисович, Александр/ABA-4085-2020	Kupcinskii, Aleksandr/0000-0001-8884-8636; 													0044-5134					OCT	2021	100	10					1175	1194		10.31857/S0044513421080092	http://dx.doi.org/10.31857/S0044513421080092													WOS:000718941900010

Flood flows and channel conveyance in the Athabasca River Delta, Canada	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT												Channel conveyance, channel size and water levels in the Athabasca River Delta were investigated in detail during three summer seasons. The Athabasca Delta is between 58 degrees N and 59 degrees N, in Alberta, Canada, and is formed immediately upstream of where the river enters Lake Athabasca. Ice-free flow rates in the river and in the various distributary channels were measured by acoustic Doppler profiler, and water surface elevations by differential GPS and pressure transducer recorders. Approximate values were measured for river bank heights, and a profile of elevation for the river bank for a distance of 80 km upstream of the lake was established. Computed bankfull flows for cross-sections starting at the delta apex were found to reduce significantly in the downstream direction. High values for bankfull conveyance at the head of the delta, equivalent to 50-year return period flood flows, were noted. For medium Athabasca River flows (about 800-1100m(3)/s), a comparison was made of water surface elevations at the delta apex during the survey, and data from 1971. A significant increase of water surface height for the same flow rate, by as much as 0.8 m, is apparent, indicating rapid channel aggradation.

Densities of HNF and ciliates were high and attained a maximum of 1.4 x 10(5) and 3500 cells ml(-1), respectively. However, the high densities decreased as chlorophyll concentration increased. Since the predominant phytoplankton species was Microcystis aeruginosa (Cyaplophyccae), toxin produced by the alga possibly affected growth of protozoans. Not only HNF but also ciliates were important consumers of bacteria, and consumption of bacteria by ciliates varied at the same level as that of HNF from August to October. Bacterial turnover rate (% d(-1)) due to consumption by the protozoa ranged between 5.6 and 112 (mean 25), and there were significant relationships between densities of bacteria and specific ingestion rates (bacteria protozoan cell(-1) h(-1)) of the protozoans. These results suggest that the food linkage between bacteria and the protozoans is substantial in the pond. We could not find any significant trophic relationships between HNF and ciliates, and between the protozoans and crustaceans.					; Nakano, Shin-ichi/M-5483-2016	Manage, Pathmalal/0000-0002-2014-2060; Ishii, Nobuyoshi/0000-0002-3176-9918													0948-3055	1616-1564				NOV 27	1998	16	2					153	161		10.3354/ame016153	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame016153													WOS:000077727000006

The pattern and its implications for the weather in coastal areas are well described, and with mesoscale-resolving operational NWP models the circulation can be captured. In this study, a straightforward method to identify sea and land breezes based on the change in wind direction in the column above a grid point on the coastline is presented. The method was tested for southern Sweden using archived output from the HARMONIE-AROME model with promising results, describing both the seasonal and diurnal cycles well. In areas with a complex coastline, such as narrow straits, the concept of the land-sea breeze becomes less clear, and several ways to address this problem for the suggested method are discussed. With an operational index of the sea and land breezes, the forecaster can better understand and express the weather situation and add value for people in the coastal zone. Further, the indices can be used to study systematic biases in the model and to create climatologies of the sea and land breezes.

The 24-hour dynamics of chlorophyll a and bacteriochlorophyll d+e in poly- and mesohumic lake was significantly smaller than that in the polyhumic lake. The maximum concentrations of chlorophyll a and bacteriochlorophyll d+e were observed near the bottom border or below the euphotic zone in waters with oxygen deficits and containing sulfur hydrogen.

J	Yamamuro, M				Yamamuro, M			Abundance and size distribution of sublittoral meiobenthos along estuarine salinity gradients	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Abundance and size distribution of the sublittoral meiobenthos in the upper 3 cm of the sediment were surveyed in the eutrophic, estuarine lagoons, Lakes Nakaumi and Shinji, Japan. Samples were taken in late spring from 10 stations located along salinity gradients. The density of meiobenthos was at a minimum in the intermediate salinity zone. Nematodes in L. Shinji were significantly larger in size than in L. Nakaumi, due to the size reduction of marine species in the latter. The biomass of co-existing bivalves, which would contribute more food supply to the meiobenthic fauna, did not affect the abundance and size of meiobenthos. It was suggested that the salinity gradient was the most influential factor on the abundance and size structure of meiobenthos in estuarine lagoons where salinity is fairly constant.

Thad			Does polymixis complicate prediction of high-frequency dissolved oxygen in lakes and reservoirs?	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												As lake and reservoir ecosystems transition across major environmental regimes (e.g., mixing regime) resulting from anthropogenic change, setting predictive expectations is imperative. We tested the hypothesis that (dissolved) oxygen is more predictable in monomictic reservoirs that thermally stratify throughout the summer (warm) season compared to polymictic reservoirs that stratify intermittently. Using two-hourly vertical profiles of oxygen, we compared daily-aggregated errors of oxygen predictions from random forests across and within two monomictic and two polymictic reservoirs in the south-central (subtropical) USA. Although one monomictic reservoir was typically more predictable than the polymictic reservoirs, the hypereutrophic, small monomictic reservoir had less predictable oxygen patterns potentially related to rapid oxygen cycling and intrusions of oxygenated waters in the hypolimnion without mixing. Daily mixing did not relate strongly to model errors. Water temperature, depth, and wind were the most important predictors, but were not clearly related to season or mixing. Lastly, we compared multiple model types (regression, neural network, and process-based) in one polymictic reservoir to test how our interpretations of oxygen predictability were sensitive to model type, finding that the models generally agreed; however, the process-based model poorly predicted oxygen in the middle of the vertical profiles (5 m) where most models performed poorly due to a temporally unstable, vacillating metalimnion. Our results suggest predicting reservoir oxygen dynamics may be easier in stratified reservoirs, but eutrophication and complex hydrodynamics may cause forecasting surprises especially for those who use or manage water resources in mono- or dimictic reservoirs.

A bobber's perspective on angler-driven vectors o invasive species transmission	NEOBIOTA												Prevention of aquatic invasive species is a fundamental management challenge. With hundreds of millions of people participating in fishing trips each year, understanding angler movements that transmit invasive species can provide critical insight into the most effective locations and scales at which to apply preventative measures. Recent evidence suggests that mobile technologies provide new opportunities to understand different types of angler movement behaviour beyond what is possible with infrequently and sparsely conducted in-person boat surveys and mail questionnaires. Here we capitalise on data provided by ReelSonar's iBobber, a sonar-enabled bobber with over 5 M recorded fishing locations, globally. By quantifying geographic patterns of fishing activities and assessing how these patterns change seasonally, we explore angler behaviour across the entire continental United States in terms of fishing frequency and distance travelled between sites and characterise the attributes of fished ecosystems. We found that iBobber users (anglers) undertook 66,918 trips to 20,049 different water-bodies over a two-year period. Anglers who use iBobber were more likely to visit larger, deeper and more urbanised water-bodies and these water-bodies were over five times more likely to be a reservoir compared to a lake. Inter-water-body travel road distances averaged 93 km (SD = 277 km; range < 1-300 km) and nearly half of these movements occurred over a timespan of two days or less, a timeframe that we show falls well within the desiccation tolerance window of many prevalent plant and animal invasive species. Our study offers novel insight into spatiotemporal patterns of angler behaviour well beyond the geographical and temporal extent of conventional ground-collected approaches and carries important implications for predicting and preventing future transmission of aquatic invasive species via recreational fishing.

Spatiotemporal variations in the lake surface water temperature (LSWT) significantly impact regional ecosystem stability, carbon cycling, and regional climate. However, due to limited observations, the intra-lake heterogeneity of LSWT and its driving forces remain unclear. By employing multi-source datasets, especially observation-constrained LSWT and lake inflow data, along with the random forest method, we analyzed three TP lakes (Nam Co, Siling Co, and Paiku Co) during 2001-2019. No evident inter-annual LSWT changes were detected. Lake inflow (up to 40% contribution) was the main driver of LSWT variations from July to November, followed by air temperature. Spatially, LSWT intra-lake heterogeneity varied among lakes, with Siling Co showing the largest difference (nearly 4 degrees C) in autumn, mainly caused by river inflow locations and lake bathymetry. This study improves our understanding of the spatiotemporal variations of LWST for high-mountain lakes, providing insights for climate-change adaptation and water resources management.

Well-drained alluvial and fluvial strata of the Wasatch Formation are overlain by carbonaceous mudstone, channelized sandstone and isolated interbedded pond deposits of the lower Luman Member, which are in turn overlain by laterally extensive calcareous mudstone of the upper Luman Member, and together record a conformable progression alluvial to paludal to lacustrine environments. Here we describe alluvial, paludal and lacustrine lithofacies along a basin-scale transect through the Luman Member depocenter. Based on detailed correlation of Luman Member strata, freshwater lakes formed first in isolated regions of high subsidence to the east and west of the Rock Springs Uplift, then expanded and became more prone to carbonate deposition.																			2211-2731		978-94-017-9906-5; 978-94-017-9905-8				2015	1						13	30		10.1007/978-94-017-9906-5_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9906-5_2	10.1007/978-94-017-9906-5												WOS:000380960200003

During the Younger Dryas time the climate was cold and vegetation cover around the lake consisted of a shrub birch-willow tundra. With warming during the early Holocene birch forest expanded across the Kola Peninsula and by 9500 cat yr BP a dense birch tree forests likely extended as far north as the modern Barents Sea coastline. By about 7800 cat yr BP Alnus incana was present as an admixture to birch in wet places as far north as the Barents Sea shoreline. Scots pine expanded to north of its modern limits on the Kola Peninsula between 7900 and 3700 cat yrBP with its maximum northward progress and abundance at 7300-6200calyrBP. Although scattered pines may have grown near the coastline, pine forests did not reach the Barents Sea coastal area and the region remained covered with birth forest-tundra as much as during earlier Holocene. The expansion of birch forest and pine forest in the early to mid Holocene likely reflects the impact of higher amounts of summer radiation due to Milankovitch forcing and warmer temperatures in the North Atlantic Ocean and Barents Sea. The mid-Holocene summer warming in the Barents Sea coastal area likely ranged from 1degreesC to 1.5degreesC above modern conditions. Following 5900 cat yr BP shrub tundra communities began to replace birch forest and pines on the northernmost Kola Peninsula. The modern tundra which occupies the coastal region near Lake KP3 was established at about 3100cal yr BP. The vegetation and climatic changes evident on the northern Kola Peninsula are similar to those evident in northernmost Fermoscandia. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Such a state-of-the-art real-time system down to 250-m grid spacing was implemented in the context of the Toronto 2015 Panamerican games, Canada (PanAm). Combined with the Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) model, attention was brought to the representation of the detailed urban landscape, and to the inclusion of sub-daily variation of the Great Lakes surface temperature. Results show a refined representation of the urban coastal environment micro-meteorology with a strong anisotropy of the urban heat island reaching about 2 degrees C on average for the summer season, coastal upwelling, and mesoscale features such as cumulus clouds and lake-breeze flow. Objective evaluation at the surface with a dense observational network reveals an overall good performance of the system and a clear improvement in comparison to reference forecasts at 2.5-km grid spacing in particular for standard deviation errors in urban areas up to 0.3 degrees C for temperature and dew point temperature, and up to 0.5 m s(-1) for the wind speed, as well as for precipitation with an increased Equitable Threat Score (ETS) by up to 0.3 for the evening accumulation. The study provides confidence in the capacity of the new system to improve weather forecasts to be delivered to urban dwellers although further investigation of the initialization methods in urban areas is needed.

J	Ma, JM; Hung, H; Blanchard, P				Ma, JM; Hung, H; Blanchard, P			How do climate fluctuations affect persistent organic pollutant distribution in North America? Evidence from a decade of air monitoring	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Interannual variations of persistent organic pollutant (POP) air concentrations from the Great Lakes region and the Arctic during the 1990s are strongly associated with atmospheric low-frequency fluctuations, notably the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Pacific North American (PNA) pattern. This suggests interactions between climate variation and the global distribution of POPS. Atmospheric concentrations of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and several lighter polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) measured around the Great Lakes basin increased during the positive phases of NAO and ENSO in the spring. This implies that anomalous high air temperatures associated with NAO and ENSO enhance volatilization of POPS from reservoirs on the Earth's surface accumulated in the past. These compounds are then available for transport from source regions to more pristine regions such as the Arctic under favorable flow patterns associated with global climate variations.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				MAY 1	2004	38	9					2538	2543		10.1021/es0349610	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es0349610								15180048					WOS:000221189900017

We analyzed this mixture of size-structured interactions for a species constellation consisting of perch (Perca fluviatilis) and roach (Rutilus rutilus) in a replicated whole lake experiment over 4 yr. Roach are preyed upon by large perch, but at the same time compete with small perch for zooplankton. Predictions regarding the effects of roach on perch performance and resource dynamics in the whole-lake experiment were based on results from previous pond and enclosure experiments carried out over short (months) time periods. Variables measured in the whole-lake experiment included both individual level parameters (diet and growth of perch) as well as population level parameters (mortality, population numbers and size structures of perch, abundance and biomass of zooplankton and benthic macroinvertebrates). The population size of perch greater than or equal to 2 yr old decreased to less than 10% of the pre-treatment levels in treatment lakes after the introduction of roach and remained low over the whole study period. The mortality in perch one-year-old and older increased with size. Larger perch had a higher growth decrease than smaller perch, but also the individual growth rate of young-of-the-year (YOY) perch was lower in treatment lakes than in control lakes. YOY perch were almost excluded during the winter and spring following the roach introduction. The few perch of this year class that survived had the following years a higher growth than the corresponding year class in control lakes. This could be related to an increased availability of predator-sensitive macroinvertebrates in treatment lakes. Perch in treatment lakes fed to a larger extent on macroinvertebrates and less on pelagic zooplankton than perch in control lakes. As expected, zooplankton abundances decreased in treatment lakes the year following the roach introduction, but thereafter zooplankton abundances were higher in treatment lakes due to the absence of perch recruitment in these lakes. No incidence of perch predation on roach was recorded during the study period. We attribute this to the spatial scale dependent escape ability and habitat use of vulnerable size classes of roach. YOY perch had a stronger impact on between-year variation in zooplankton than YOY roach and this can be related to the higher foraging (handling) capacity of the former and the restricted habitat use of the latter. Individual level parameters (diet, growth) had a higher statistical power than population level parameters (abundance, biomass, mortality), and small-scale experiments successfully predicted a higher proportion (81%) of the individual level parameters. However, the lower success in predicting population level responses (38%) was directly connected to a failure to predict individual level parameters (large perch diet and growth). Our results suggest that the small spatial scale was the major limitation on the predictive ability of the small-scale experiments.					; Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012	Hjelm, Joakim/0000-0001-8423-8873; 													0030-1299	1600-0706				OCT	1999	87	1					139	156		10.2307/3547005	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3547005													WOS:000083252700015
J	Carena, L; Comis, S; Vione, D				Carena, Luca; Comis, Silvia; Vione, Davide			Geographical and temporal assessment of the photochemical decontamination potential of river waters from agrochemicals: A first application to the Piedmont region (NW Italy)	CHEMOSPHERE												This work shows the potential of using photochemical modelling to assess the river-water ability to photodegrade agrochemicals on a geographic and temporal scale. The case of flowing water requires different data treatment compared to more stationary water bodies (e.g., lakes), but it could allow for the identification of particularly vulnerable environments. Five pesticides were considered here, and the photodegradation rate followed the order bentazon > isoproturon > dimethomorph similar to chlortoluron > atrazine. The modelled photodegradation kinetics was particularly fast in the river Po, which receives significant input of agricultural nitrate from groundwater and features higher steady-state [(OH)-O-center dot] than most other rivers in the region. The fact that the Po eventually collects all river waters in Piedmont is positive, from the point of view of comprehensive photodegradation of pesticides. However, this paradoxical situation of agricultural pollution (nitrate) helping fight pollution from the same source (pesticides) has two important limitations: (i) when compared to the parent compounds, some intermediates deriving from (OH)-O-center dot reactions are either more harmful (N-formyl derivatives of phenylureas), or about as harmful (desethyl atrazine); (ii) banned atrazine is no longer sprayed over fields during the plant growth season, but it reaches surface waters from legacy groundwater inputs. The latter are operational also during winter, when photochemistry is least active. Therefore, photochemistry might not ensure considerable attenuation of atrazine during wintertime. Overall, bentazon would be the safest among the studied pesticides because of fast degradation by direct photolysis, and of low ecotoxicological impact of its phototransformation intermediates.

Methane and carbon dioxide emissions from 40 lakes along a north-south latitudinal transect in Alaska	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Uncertainties in the magnitude and seasonality of various gas emission modes, particularly among different lake types, limit our ability to estimate methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from northern lakes. Here we assessed the relationship between CH4 and CO2 emission modes in 40 lakes along a latitudinal transect in Alaska to lakes' physicochemical properties and geographic characteristics, including permafrost soil type surrounding lakes. Emission modes included direct ebullition, diffusion, storage flux, and a newly identified ice-bubble storage (IBS) flux. We found that all lakes were net sources of atmospheric CH4 and CO2, but the climate warming impact of lake CH4 emissions was 2 times higher than that of CO2. Ebullition and diffusion were the dominant modes of CH4 and CO2 emissions, respectively. IBS, similar to 10% of total annual CH4 emissions, is the release to the atmosphere of seasonally ice-trapped bubbles when lake ice confining bubbles begins to melt in spring. IBS, which has not been explicitly accounted for in regional studies, increased the estimate of springtime emissions from our study lakes by 320 %. Geographically, CH4 emissions from stratified, mixotrophic interior Alaska thermokarst (thaw) lakes formed in icy, organic-rich yedoma permafrost soils were 6-fold higher than from non-yedoma lakes throughout the rest of Alaska. The relationship between CO2 emissions and geographic parameters was weak, suggesting high variability among sources and sinks that regulate CO2 emissions (e.g., catchment waters, pH equilibrium). Total CH4 emission was correlated with concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus and total nitrogen in lake water, Secchi depth, and lake area, with yedoma lakes having higher nutrient concentrations, shallower Secchi depth, and smaller lake areas. Our findings suggest that permafrost type plays important roles in determining CH4 emissions from lakes by both supplying organic matter to methanogenesis directly from thawing permafrost and by enhancing nutrient availability to primary production, which can also fuel decomposition and methanogenesis.

The population was mainly comprised of age-groups 0+ (59%) and 1+ (18%), while the total share of age-groups 6+ and older was less than 1%. Mean back-calculated standard lengths for age-groups 0+-9+ were 67, 123, 144, 196, 233, 256, 283, 316, 350, and 369 turn, respectively. The instantaneous rate of growth in weight was lower at age 2+ than it was at age 3+ and 4+, suggesting unfavourable conditions for Volga pikeperch 120-160 mm in size. In autumn, the average abundance of Volga pikeperch was 34 ind. ha(-1), the biomass 1.04 kg ha(-1) and the production 0.76 kg ha(-1) in the SW basin of Lake Balaton. Based on the diet, three phases can be distinguished during the ontogeny. Zooplanktivory is characteristic for the early juvenile stage up to 50 rum in size. At the size of 50-150 mm the diet becomes heterogeneous, consisting of zooplankters, benthic invertebrates, and fish. The third phase is the piscivory which becomes a determinant at over 150 turn in size. In this phase cannibalism was also significant, as 21.9% of consumed fish were conspecifics.					; Specziár, András/N-5656-2019; Biro, Peter/CAJ-0232-2022	Specziar, Andras/0000-0001-6341-636X; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 15	2003	506	1-3					503	510		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008535.98144.1e	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008535.98144.1e													WOS:000188455600067

Variability of delta(A), an atmospheric characteristic determined by air-mass origin and history, is a potentially useful tracer of synoptic atmospheric variations, and is an important control on isotopic behaviour of open-water bodies during surface-atmosphere exchange and evaporation.

River piracy and drainage basin reorganization led by climate-driven glacier retreat	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												River piracy-the diversion of the headwaters of one stream into another one-can dramatically change the routing of water and sediment, with a profound effect on landscape evolution. Stream piracy has been investigated in glacial environments, but so far it has mainly been studied over Quaternary or longer timescales. Here we document how retreat of Kaskawulsh Glacier-one of Canada's largest glaciers-abruptly and radically altered the regional drainage pattern in spring 2016. We use a combination of hydrological measurements and drone-generated digital elevation models to show that in late May 2016, meltwater from the glacier was re-routed from discharge in a northward direction into the Bering Sea, to southward into the Pacific Ocean. Based on satellite image analysis and a signal-to-noise ratio as a metric of glacier retreat, we conclude that this instance of river piracy was due to post-industrial climate change. Rapid regional drainage reorganizations of this type can have profound downstream impacts on ecosystems, sediment and carbon budgets, and downstream communities that rely on a stable and sustained discharge. We suggest that the planforms of Slims and Kaskawulsh rivers will adjust in response to altered flows, and the future Kaskawulsh watershed will extend into the now-abandoned headwaters of Slims River and eventually capture the Kluane Lake drainage.

This technique can be used to measure the direction and magnitude of mercury transfer between the atmosphere and lake or soil surfaces. Measurements have been performed over four oligotrophic forest lakes in southwestern Sweden during 1988 and 1989. Net emission fluxes of mercury were measured from the lakes. The measured daytime fluxes during the warmer season (water temperatures 13-23-degrees-C) were within the range 3-20 ng h-1 m-2 (average 7.9 ng h-1 m-2). The average night-time fluxes measured during the same season were 2 to 3 times smaller. Two sets of measurements, performed during the winter when water temperatures were less-than-or-equal-to 2-degrees-C, gave flux values close to zero. Flux measurements were also performed over soil in a coniferous forest. Compared to the situation for the forest lakes, the fluxes of mercury over forest soil are much lower in magnitude, with values ranging from approximately -2 to +2 ng h-1 m-2 during different seasons. Emission was observed with an average of 0.3 ng h-1 m-2 when soil temperature was about 10-degrees-C, while dry deposition was measured with an average of 0.9 ng h-1 m-2, when soil temperature was < 3-degrees-C.

J	Bertrand, M; Marcogliese, DJ; Magnan, P				Bertrand, Micheline; Marcogliese, David J.; Magnan, Pierre			Effect of Wetland Enhancement on Parasites of Juvenile Yellow Perch	WETLANDS												Impoundments and dams are frequently used in wetlands to stabilize water levels and maintain breeding habitat for waterfowl. The objective of the study was to examine the effect of reduced water level fluctuations and connectivity on fish parasitism in wetlands caused by the installation of such structures. We compared parasites of juvenile yellow perch (Perca flavescens) from two enhanced wetlands where water level is regulated and where connection with the main channel occurs only during spring flood (enhanced wetlands) to parasites of juvenile perch living in seasonally flooded wetlands where connection with the main channel is continuous (natural wetlands). Parasite species richness and Shannon diversity index were higher in natural than in enhanced wetlands. Jaccard similarity index revealed a higher similarity in parasite assemblages within than between each type of wetlands. Glochidia and parasites that include clams in their life cycle were absent from the two enhanced wetlands. Our study suggested that local factors such as water level fluctuation and connectivity in enhanced wetlands may limit the establishment of bivalves and that the use of impoundments and dams in wetlands areas may have an impact on some components of the food web.

This work describes a model for the propagations of coastal rockfalls, i.e., blocks detaching from a subaerial cliff, propagating initially in air, impacting against the water surface, and finally coming to rest in the water basin. Application of the model to two real cases in Italy shows a satisfactory agreement between the predicted rockfall run-out and the field data. Some scattering observed in the data is explained as the consequence of different heights of the source area. It is shown that largest boulders usually reach a longer distance. However, the schematic shape for blocks adopted in the model likely results in a much more regular behaviour compared to reality. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Remote sensing of hydrologic recharge in the Peace-Athabasca Delta, Canada	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Northern wetlands like Canada's Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) have global environmental significance, yet fundamental processes of hydrologic recharge critical to their functionality remain poorly understood. We use in situ water level and MODIS satellite data to examine how main-stem river level fluctuations drive inundation across the delta. Temporal covariance between the two datasets allows inference of hydrologic connectivity processes, not just inundation extent. A strong contrast is found between hydrologic connectivity properties in a high-water (2007) vs. low-water year (2006). Results suggest that existing theoretical models of floodplain recharge fail to capture observed patterns of inundation in the PAD. Instead, we find a dichotomy between the distributary channel network, which responds to summer high-water events, and floodplain lakes and wetlands, which do not. The latter occurs even where hydrologic connections do exist between the two. Results have strong management implications for the impact of proposed up-river water diversion on PAD hydrology.

J	Bookhagen, B; Thiede, RC; Strecker, MR				Bookhagen, B; Thiede, RC; Strecker, MR			Late Quaternary intensified monsoon phases control landscape evolution in the northwest Himalaya	GEOLOGY												The intensity of the Asian summer-monsoon circulation varies over decadal to millennial time scales and is reflected in changes in surface processes, terrestrial environments, and marine sediment records. However, the mechanisms of long-lived (2-5 k.y.) intensified monsoon phases, the related changes in precipitation distribution, and their effect on landscape evolution and sedimentation rates are not yet well understood. The and high-elevation sectors of the orogen correspond to a climatically sensitive zone that currently receives rain only during abnormal (i.e., strengthened) monsoon seasons. Analogous to present-day rainfall anomalies, enhanced precipitation during an intensified monsoon phase is expected to have penetrated far into these geomorphic threshold regions where hillslopes are close to the angle of failure. We associate landslide triggering during intensified monsoon phases with enhanced precipitation, discharge, and sediment flux leading to an increase in pore-water pressure, lateral scouring of rivers, and over-steepening of hillslopes, eventually resulting in failure of slopes and exceptionally large mass movements. Here we use lacustrine deposits related to spatially and temporally clustered large landslides (>0.5 km(3)) in the Sutlej Valley region of the northwest Himalaya to calculate sedimentation rates and to infer rainfall patterns during late Pleistocene (29-24 ka) and Holocene (10-4 ka) intensified monsoon phases. Compared to present-day sediment-flux measurements, a fivefold increase in sediment-transport rates recorded by sediments in landslide-dammed lakes characterized these episodes of high climatic variability. These changes thus emphasize the pronounced imprint of millennial-scale climate change on surface processes and landscape evolution.

Allen			Reeling in the damages: Harmful algal blooms' impact on Lake Erie's recreational fishing industry	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Lake Erie is one of the most valuable natural resources in the United States, providing billions of dollars in benefits each year to recreationalists, homeowners and local governments. The ecosystem services provided by Lake Erie, however, are under threat due to harmful algal blooms. This paper provides recreational damage estimates using spatially and temporally varying algae measures and monthly fishing permit sales collected between 2011 and 2014. Results indicate that fishing license sales drop between 10% and 13% when algal conditions surpass the World Health's Organization's moderate health risk advisory threshold of 20,000 cyanobacteria cells/mL. For Lake Erie adjacent counties experiencing a large, summer-long algal bloom, this would result in approximately 3600 fewer fishing licenses issued and approximately $2.25 million to $5.58 million in lost fishing expenditures. Our results show a discrete jump in reduced angling activity upon crossing this threshold, with limited additional impacts associated with more severe algal blooms. This suggests that policies aimed at eliminating, rather than mitigating, algal levels are most beneficial to the Ohio angling industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Thermal and ground-penetrating radar analysis show that the portions of the island not covered by glaciers are underlain by continuous permafrost, while some of the glaciers appear to be polythermal with subglacial taliks. Hydrological observations indicate that taliks generated beneath glaciers can extend beyond the glacial limits, thus modifying the surrounding terrestrial hydrological system. An icing that varies in size annually was found to result from the draining of a large tunnel complex that extended from within a glacier out into the surrounding lateral moraine. Nearby, a large perennial icing grew from water flow through a subglacial talik originating beneath an ice-dammed lake. In both these cases it was found that the subsurface hydrological system was a continuum between the glacial and periglacial environments.																					90-5809-582-7				2003							783	788																WOS:000185049300137

However, the sources and enrichment mechanisms of these elements remain disputed. Herein, big data on B isotopes and geochemistry were compiled to reveal cycling and enrichment of B and associated Li in the complex mountain-basin systems of the TP. Various water bodies on the TP show remarkably high B and Li concentrations compared with the global average levels. B and Li are supernormally enriched or even mineralized in some salt lakes, oilfield brines, and geothermal systems. Water with high B concentrations exhibits simultaneous 11B depletion. The spatial patterns of B-Li concentrations and delta 11B values are characterized by a westward increase and a southward decrease, respectively. The mechanisms of B and Li cycling and enrichment, from source to sink, on the TP can be summarized as follows: 1) Slab subduction and following continental collisions induced partial melting of the midlower crust, resulting in late-stage highly differentiated crust-derived magma upwelling and invasion into the mid-upper crust. Hot springs thereby maintain an efficient release of abnormally abundant B and Li from magmatic fluids to the surface through deep geothermal circulation. 2) In the eastern and southeastern TP, Massive degassing of mantle fractions prevails along large strike-slip faults. B and Li enriched from mantle- or crust-derived fluids can reach the surface via local volcanism. 3) Water-rock interaction and weathering trigger further activation, mobilization, and enrichment of B and Li in water. The aforementioned geological processes supply constantly deep-source B and Li to rivers and groundwater as cold-hot springs. Eventually, B and Li are fed into the lake basin jointly with supergene processes; after prolonged evaporation-concentration, excellent B-Lirich salt lake resources are formed.

J	Bartlein, PJ; Harrison, SP; Izumi, K				Bartlein, Patrick J.; Harrison, Sandy P.; Izumi, Kenji			Underlying causes of Eurasian midcontinental aridity in simulations of mid-Holocene climate	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Climate model simulations uniformly show drier and warmer summers in the Eurasian midcontinent during the mid-Holocene, which is not consistent with paleoenvironmental observations. The simulated climate results from a reduction in the zonal temperature gradient, which weakens westerly flow and reduces moisture flux and precipitation in the midcontinent. As a result, sensible heating is favored over evaporation and latent heating, resulting in substantial surface-driven atmospheric warming. Thus, the discrepancy with the paleoenvironmental evidence arises initially from a problem in the simulated circulation and is exacerbated by feedback from the land surface. This region is also drier and warmer than indicated by observations in the preindustrial control simulations, and this bias arises in the same way: zonal flow and hence moisture flux into the midcontinent are too weak, and feedback from the land surface results in surface-driven warming. These analyses suggest the need to improve those aspects of climate models that affect the strength of westerly circulation.

The small farms were then abandoned, following which the lake surroundings were planted with forest trees. The presented study of human influence on the lake ecosystem and surrounding vegetation has been based on analyses of general sediment composition and its chemistry, pollen, Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyceae, Rotatoria, Cladocera, and a preliminary diatom survey. The history of human impact has been divided into four phases: 1. Phase of small local hamlets (before ca. 1770): The human impact was rather moderate then, but the cultivation of Canabis sativa, Secale cereale and later of Fagopyrum is evidenced from that time. 2. Phase of 'Hollandii' settlement (ca. 1770-1863). Its influence is indicated first by the recession of deciduous wood (Corylus, Carpinus) stands, which triggered drastic drop of calcium in sediments. The development of rural economy in the area, including, an extension of agriculture (Secale and other cereals, crucifers, potatoes), and animal breeding based partly on grazing in the forest, is evidenced only after 1820. 3. Phase of German colonization (1863-1944): In the early periods (before 1910) the pollen spectra do not document any essential change in the type of farming, however, a serious disturbance of the lake ecosystem and sediment chemistry is evidenced by the blooms of Araphidinae diatoms and Tetraedron minimum, a maximum frequency of Bosmina longirostris, disturbances of the regular spring blooms of Chrysophyceae, appearance of vivianite, distinct maxima of organic matter, potassium, and iron concentration in sediments and an increase of the sedimentation rate. An intensification of agricultural activities commenced around 1910; woods, including also pinewoods, were then heavily devastated, and farming extended on poor soils, what was symptomatic for the general poverty of population. Coincidently in the lake, Centriceae showed blooms, Araphidinae diatoms and Tetraedron minimum developed, and the content of potassium, iron and phosphorus increased substantially, indicating altogether rising eutrophication. 4. Phase of restoration of the natural landscape (after 1945): The farm degradation from ca. 1944 is very weakly expressed in pollen data, which show a substantial fall of farming indicators from 1953/6 only, when the whole area was used for forest plantation. It was accompanied by a certainly spontaneous development of Betula and Alnus woods, this process progressing till recent time. The gradual extinction of farming activity near Lake Gosciaz was accompanied by abrupt changes in the lake ecosystem, expressed by the restored blooms of Chrysophyceae expansion of planktonic Cladocera, rapid decline of phosphorus and extinction of vivianite from sediments. As documented by the drop of Cu/Zn ratio, lake hypolimnion has been weakly oxidized since 1949, what was probably responsible for the drop of Fe and Mn content in sediments. Increasing strength of overturns affected preservation of laminae in sediments, which almost completely disappeared after 1966.

The resulting population sex ratios are hard to predict from laboratory studies if the environmental triggers interact with other factors, whereas in field studies, singular observations of unusual sex ratios may be particularly prone to selective reporting. Long-term monitoring largely avoids these problems. We studied a population of grayling (Thymallus thymallus) in Lake Thun, Switzerland, that has been monitored since 1948. Samples of spawning fish have been caught about 3 times/week around spawning season, and water temperature at the spawning site has been continuously recorded since 1970. We used scale samples collected in different years to determine the average age of spawners (for life-stage specific analyses) and to identify the cohort born in 2003 (an extraordinarily warm year). Recent tissue samples were genotyped on microsatellite markers to test for genetic bottlenecks in the past and to estimate the genetically effective population size (Ne). Operational sex ratios changed from approximately 65% males before 1993 to approximately 85% males from 1993 to 2011. Sex ratios correlated with the water temperatures the fish experienced in their first year of life. Sex ratios were best explained by the average temperature juvenile fish experienced during their first summer. Grayling abundance is declining, but we found no evidence of a strong genetic bottleneck that would explain the apparent lack of evolutionary response to the unequal sex ratio. Results of other studies show no evidence of endocrine disruptors in the study area. Our findings suggest temperature affects population sex ratio and thereby contributes to population decline.					; Wedekind, Claus/S-3353-2016; Szekely, Tamas/I-7089-2016	Wedekind, Claus/0000-0001-6143-4716; Evanno, Guillaume/0000-0003-4832-1914; Szekely, Tamas/0000-0003-2093-0056													0888-8892					FEB	2013	27	1					229	234		10.1111/j.1523-1739.2012.01909.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2012.01909.x								22891785					WOS:000313781600024

Four nested subwatersheds in Southern Ontario, Canada (one natural woodlot, two agricultural and one mixed agricultural and urban) were monitored over one year to identify peak periods ('hot moments') and areas ('hot spots') of nutrient (dissolved reactive phosphorus, DRP; total phosphorus, TP; and nitrate, NOT) export and discharge. Annual nutrient export was small at the natural site (0.001 kg DRP ha(-1); 0.004 kg TP ha(-1); 0.04 kg NO3-N ha(-1)) compared to the agricultural and mixed-use sites (0.10-0.15 kg DRP ha(-1); 0.70-0.94 kg TP ha(-1); 9.15-11.55 kg NO3-N ha(-1)). Temporal patterns in P concentrations were similar throughout the sites, where spring was the dominant season for P export, irrespective of land use. Within the Hopewell Creek watershed, P and N hot spots existed that were consistently hot spots across all events with the location of these hot spots driven by local land use patterns, where there was elevated P export from a dairy-dominated sub-watershed and elevated N export from both of the two agricultural subwatersheds. These estimates of seasonal- and event-based nutrient loads and discharge across nested sub-watersheds contribute to the growing body of evidence demonstrating the importance of identifying critical areas and periods in which to emphasize management efforts.

BSP.) near the shore of Clearwater Lake in the eastern Canadian subarctic yielded information on water level over the past three centuries. Tree positions, growth forms, layering, tree ring patterns, and ice scars provide direct evidence of a major rise in lake level. From the 17th century to the present, trees on the lake shore were progressively submerged by the increasing water level, which reached a maximum in this century. Higher levels began around the mid-18th century when shoreline spruce trees started to lean because extensive wave erosion caused landward shore displacement. High mortality of leaning spruce and abundant ice scar formation occurred during this century. The rise in water level is inferred to have been caused by snowier winters occurring parallel to climatic warming.																			0033-5894	1096-0287				SEP	1988	30	2					210	220		10.1016/0033-5894(88)90025-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0033-5894(88)90025-7													WOS:A1988Q044300009

Dissolved 137Cs concentrations in the discharge water of both dams showed seasonal fluctuation, but the phase of the fluctuation lagged that of water temperature, and the relationship between the distribution coefficient of 137Cs and temperature in the dam discharge water was poorly reproduced by the van't Hoff equation. These discrepancies indicate that dissolved 137Cs concentrations in the dam discharge are not determined predominantly by in situ ion exchange between solid and aqueous phases. In autumn 2019, dissolved 137Cs concentrations in the discharge of both dams decreased markedly, and the role of the Yokokawa Dam lake shifted from that of a source to a sink of dissolved 137Cs for the following three years. This occurred because Typhoon Hagibis brought intensive rainfall and caused watershed erosion, which resulted in accumulation of large amounts of sediment and changed the 137Cs balance between the water and sediment in the dam lake. When dam water storage decreased, notable increase in dissolved 137Cs concentration was observed in the discharge water. Multiple partial regression indicated that water level decline is more influential relative to water temperature rise regarding the increase in dissolved 137Cs concentrations in lake water, suggesting that water level management could mitigate the elevation of 137Cs concentration in discharge water.

J	Wang, JN; Zhang, ZL				Wang, Junna; Zhang, Zhonglong			Phytoplankton, dissolved oxygen and nutrient patterns along a eutrophic river-estuary continuum: Observation and modeling	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Transport and fate of phytoplankton blooms and excessive nutrients along salinity and turbidity gradients of a river-estuary continuum could determine when and where impaired water quality occurs. However, the general spatiotemporal patterns, underlying mechanisms and their implication for water quality management are not well understood. This study reveals typical seasonal variations and longitudinal patterns of phytoplankton, dissolved oxygen (DO) and nutrients (C, N, and P) in the lower St. Johns River estuary in Florida based on 23 years of data and a model which spans 3 years. Evident declines in freshwater phytoplankton and DO concentrations were observed in the freshwater-saltwater transition zone and the estuarine turbidity maxima along the river-estuary continuum. Observations show that most cyanobacteria blooms originating from upstream lakes collapsed in the freshwater-saltwater transition zone where salinity was greater than 1 ppt, but data analysis and model simulation both indicate salinity stress was not the sole reason, other factors such as changes in hydrodynamics and river morphology also contributed to the bloom crashes. Inorganic nutrients (ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate) exhibited inverse longitudinal patterns with phytoplankton. Due to algal uptake, summer concentrations of inorganic nutrients were low in the freshwater, but substantially elevated in the marine reach as a result of large point source inputs and nutrient regeneration from organic detritus. However, because of strong river-ocean mixing, the dramatic increase in nutrients did not promote a phytoplankton bloom in the local marine reach. The nutrients were eventually transported into coastal waters or oceans where they fueled phytoplankton blooms. Our findings highlight that strategies for nutrient reduction and phytoplankton bloom management should be developed beyond local reaches and across a river-estuary-ocean continuum, exploring the possibility that freshwater phytoplankton blooms and excessive nutrients may be transported to downstream estuaries, coastal waters and even oceans that are vulnerable to poor water quality.																			0301-4797	1095-8630				MAY 1	2020	261								110233	10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110233	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110233								32148303					WOS:000521511800062

Age constraints on the late Quaternary evolution of Qinghai Lake, Tibetan Plateau	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Dating and geomorphology of shoreline features in the Qinghai Lake basin of northwestern China suggest that, contrary to previous interpretations, the lake likely did not reach levels 66-140 m above modem within the past similar to 90,000 yr. Maximum highstands of similar to 20-66 in above modem probably date to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5. MIS 3 highstands are undated and uncertain but may have been at or below post-glacial highs. The lake probably reached similar to 3202-3206 in (+8-12 m) during the early Holocene but stayed below similar to 3202 in after similar to 8.4 ka. This shoreline history implies significantly different hydrologic balances in the Qinghai Lake basin before similar to 90 ka and after similar to 45 ka, possibly the result of a more expansive Asian monsoon in MIS 5.

We present data on the valve chemistry (delta O-18, delta C-13, Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca) of living Limnocythere inopinata, a common and eurytopic Holarctic ostracode species, and on simultaneously collected water chemistry data from 15 water bodies in western Mongolia. These selected lake and pond study sites provide a fair representation of the regional trend in solute evolution towards pronounced calcium depletion, which is further characterized by good correlation between Mg/Ca-water and total dissolved solids. Ostracode valve chemistry analysis showed that the Sr/Ca ratio (Sr/Ca-valve) correlates better with Sr/Ca-water than Mg/Ca-valve does with Mg/Ca-water, perhaps because Sr/Ca is less affected by calcification rate and temperature. The difference in delta O-18 between the collected valves and a hypothetical ostracode calcite formed during midsummer reveals an overall coherent trend of evaporative enrichment during summer in the sampled perennial water bodies, whereas smaller and/or ephemeral water bodies appear to be stronger impacted by stochastic rain events. Among-lake variation in delta C-13 likely reflects the regional gradient in aquatic productivity, and the uniform pattern of relatively small mean offset between the delta C-13 of ostracode valves and of surface-water dissolved inorganic carbon suggests epibenthic molting behavior in a well-mixed littoral habitat. The observed patterns in water and valve chemistry further suggest that females of L inopinata, in this particular climatic setting, molt to adult in early summer. This information on calcification time and environment contributes to more rigorous paleo-environmental interpretation of lake-sediment records of this common species in central Asia. Our results also suggest potential for quantitative salinity reconstruction based on ostracode Mg/Ca-valve in western Mongolian lakes, however this needs to be constrained by insight in the local hydrology and hydrochemistry of the reconstruction site.

The new Mojave Desert climate-landscape record is particularly detailed for the late Holocene. Evidence from ephemeral lake deposits and landforms indicates times of sustained stream flow during a wet interval of the latter part of the Medieval Warm Period at ca. AD 1290 and during the Little Ice Age at ca. AD 1650. The former lakes postdate megadroughts of the Medieval Warm Period, whereas the latter match the Maunder Minimum of the Little Ice Age. Periods of alluvial fan aggradation across the Mojave Desert are 14-9 cal ka and 63 cal ka. This timing largely correlates to times of increased sea-surface temperatures in the Gulf of California and enhanced warm-season monsoons. This correlation suggests that sustained alluvial fan aggradation may be driven by intense summer-season storms. These data suggest that the close proximity of the Mojave Desert to the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of California promotes a partitioning of landscape-process responses to climate forcings that vary with seasonality of the dominant storms. Cool-season Pacific frontal storms cause river flow, ephemeral lakes, and fan incision, whereas periods of intense warm-season storms cause hillslope erosion and alluvial fan aggradation. The proposed landscape-process partitioning has important implications for hazard mitigation given that climate change may increase sea-surface temperatures in the Gulf of California, which indirectly could increase future alluvial fan aggradation.

IN NATURAL BIOCENOSIS OF LATVIA, RESEARCH EXPERIMENTS AND PRODUCTION FIELDS	RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY					International Scientific Conference on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency	MAY 28-30, 2012	Jelgava, LATVIA	Latvia Univ Agr				In recent years, perennial grasses have not been considered only as a forage crop but focus has shifted to their usage as an energy crop. Special interest has been caused by reed canary grass, which is widely spread in natural biocenosis. The scientific expeditions have been organized and all regions of Latvia have been explored to gather material and information about biodiversity of perennial species of wild grasses. Several natural populations of reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) were collected under different soil and climate conditions. The accessions were of different quality in many respects depending on collection site. Samples taken from the marshy meadows on lakeshore of the Lake Lubana were coming into flowers unevenly over a longer period of time and formed a little number of culms, whereas samples collected on the banks of the River Daugava were earlier and formed considerably more culms and were coming into flowers evenly over a shorter period of time. Breeding on reed canary grass in Latvia has not been done previously. Attention to the wild populations of RCG usually has been focused on their feeding value. Though, these populations have a good potential for selection of a new varieties intended for varied purposes. The field trials with ten wild accessions of RCG were established, and winter hardiness, growth intensity and various phenological observations were evaluated. After a comprehensive evaluation of the wild populations by important economic and morphologic characteristics, some valuable samples were found. The population 'Brigena' proved such valuable characteristics as good winter hardiness, high dry matter yields, and intensive development of productive culms. In recent years, consumption of reed canary grass as energy feedstock has increased rapidly in Latvia. It is grown by farmers in all regions and the total planted area has exceeded 800 ha. Mostly are grown varieties 'Marathon' (USA) and 'Bamse' (Sweden). DM yields obtained by farmers in Latvia on average are 6 - 9 t ha(-1). Further research has to be continued.																					978-9984-48-070-1				2012							61	65																WOS:000368744600011

In the aim of taking out the implication of paleoclimate variations on lake level changes in the Adamawa plateau during the Holocene, diatoms records coupled with C/N ratio and P content in the Lake Fonjak sediments were studied. They exhibit three zones related to the water level variations since 13,500 cal yr BP. From 13,500 to 4400 cal yr BP, the zone I evidences the predominance of planktonics, suggesting a high-water level in the Lake Fonjak at this period. From 4400 to 3600 cal yr BP, the zone II shows the appearance of tychoplanktonics, followed by the rise of both aerophilous and epiphytics, indicating the lake level oscillations at centennial timescale with shallow water and dried areas in the borders. Beyond 3600 cal yr BP, the zone III corresponds to the rise of both benthics and aerophilous, suggesting an important lowering of the water-level until sub-modern conditions. These changes are linked to the displacement ITCZ mean positions in the context of the decreasing summer insolation in the northern hemisphere.																			1464-343X	1879-1956				OCT	2021	182								104286	10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2021.104286	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2021.104286		JUN 2021											WOS:000687339400004

Speleothem records of glacial/interglacial climate from Iran forewarn of future Water Availability in the interior of the Middle East	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												This study presents the first absolute-dated record of climate variability constructed by oxygen isotopes (delta O-18(c)) from stalagmites in the interior of West Asia (Middle East) that encompass the Last Interglacial and early glacial periods (73,000-127,000 Before Present, BP) and early Holocene (6500-7500 BP). Variations in delta O-18(c) of two stalagmites from Qal'e Kord (QK) cave in central NW Iran show significant agreement and follow the solar insolation curve at 30 degrees N closely, indicating the fidelity of these records as climate signals. The stalagmites capture millennial-scale Dansgaard/Oeschger stadial and interstadial events (19-25) observed in the North Greenland Ice Core Project (NGRIP). These observations point to the presence of a strong atmospheric teleconnection between the north Atlantic climate and the Middle East region. Variations in delta O-18(c) from QK cave also agree with the main features of Marine Isotope Stage 5 (MIS5), climate reconstructions from Soreq Cave, Israel, and Sanbao Cave in East Asia. This suggests propagation of a pan-Eurasian climate signal via interplay between changes in solar insolation, strength and position of the mid-latitude Westerly Jet, and strength of the Asian Monsoon. More negative delta O-18(c) from QK stalagmites are representative of wetter conditions when JJA insolation is at maximum, supporting a hypothesis that winter precipitation should increase in the Mediterranean storm tracks over the interior of West Asia when seasonality is at maximum. This record of water availability from central NW Iran across past glacial cycles suggests precipitation increased with higher solar insolation, an orbital configuration that will not return for another 10,000 years.

During this spring sampling period several yellow-sand events characterized by long-range transport from China and Mongolia impacted the area. Understanding the impact of yellow-sand events on atmospheric dry deposition is critical to managing the heavy metal levels in the environment in Korea. In this study, the measured flux of a primarily crustal metal, Al and an anthropogenic metal, Pb was used with two hybrid. receptor models, potential source contribution function (PSCF) and residence time weighted concentration (RTWC) for locating sources of heavy metals associated with atmospheric dry deposition fluxes during the yellow-sand events in Seoul, Korea. The PSCF using a criterion value of the 75th percentile of the measured dry deposition fluxes and RTWC results using the measured elemental dry deposition fluxes agreed well and consistently showed that there were large potential source areas in the Gobi Desert in China and Mongolia and industrial areas near Tianjin, Tangshan, and Shenyang in China. Major industrial areas of Shenyang, Fushun, and Anshan, the Central China loess plateau, the Gobi Desert, and the Alashan semi-desert in China were identified to be major source areas for the measured Pb flux in Seoul, Korea. For Al, the main industrial areas of Tangshan, Tianjin and Beijing, the Gobi Desert, the Alashan semi-desert, and the Central China loess plateau were found to be the major source areas. These results indicate that both anthropogenic sources such as industrial areas and natural sources such as deserts contribute to the high dry deposition fluxes of both Pb and Al in Seoul, Korea during yellow-sand events. RTWC resolved several high potential source areas. Modeling results indicated that the long-range transport of Al and Pb from China during yellow-sand events as well as non-yellow-sand spring daytimes increased atmospheric dry deposition of heavy metals in Korea.

Microbial processes were the driving force of mainly anaerobic and also aerobic P release from iron, reductant-soluble and organic P-rich sediments. For 1992 and 1993, two years of very different runoff characteristics, the extent of P release was indirectly controlled by external factors, including the supply of dissolved oxygen and nitrate via inflow (high runoff), changes in land use (e.g., decreasing nitrogen fertilization), and climatic factors, and it was facilitated by wind-induced rapid changes of stratification and mixing events.

Vascular macrophytes characterized the silty sediment, while macroalgae and allochthonous detritus predominated in sandy sediment.

In particular, data were gathered to assess the effects of management strategies on the physiological status of reed beds and to collect information for defining further conservation programs. Results point to the central role played by water levels both on reed plot re-growth efficiency and on reed health; cutting back the reeds, however, (which is done exclusively in winter) seems to have a negligible impact on common reed beds while removing detritus from their midst appears to have a positive effects on reed health and in general on the quality of the littoral zone in question.					; Bresciani, Mariano/H-7501-2013; Bolpagni, Rossano/Q-7053-2018	Bresciani, Mariano/0000-0002-7185-8464; Bolpagni, Rossano/0000-0001-9283-2821													1129-8596						2011	43	2					9	22		10.5721/ItJRS20114321	http://dx.doi.org/10.5721/ItJRS20114321													WOS:000297722400004
J	Brown, SP; Loot, G; Grenfell, BT; Guégan, JF				Brown, SP; Loot, G; Grenfell, BT; Guégan, JF			Host manipulation by Ligula intestinalis: accident or adaptation?	PARASITOLOGY												Numerous studies have demonstrated that parasites with complex life-cycles can cause phenotypic modifications in their hosts that lead to an increased rate of transmission, and suggest that these modifications are the result of parasitic adaptations to manipulate the host. Little attention is paid, however, to separating the possibility of adaptive host manipulation from incidental (if fortuitous) side-effects of infection. In this study we combine statistical and analytical tools to interpret the impact of the macroparasite Ligula intestinalis L. (Cestoda, Pseudophyllidea) on the behaviour of its intermediate fish host (the roach, Rutilus rutilus L.), using field data on a natural system. Two distinct sets of generalized linear models agree that both the presence and the intensity of infection contribute to a modified behavioural response in the host. This was illustrated by a preference for the lake-edge in infected fish during autumn. Furthermore, the effect of parasites upon their host is heterogeneous with respect to parasite size, with larger parasite individuals having a disproportionate impact. A series of game-theoretic models of adaptive host manipulation illustrate a potential rationale for a size-dependent manipulation strategy in parasites. These findings illustrate the potential complexity and functionality of the impact of L. intestinalis upon its fish host, which together reduce the parsimony of the alternative 'incidental effect' hypothesis.

J	Jones, RI; Young, JM				Jones, RI; Young, JM			Control of bacterioplankton growth and abundance in deep, oligotrophic Loch Ness (Scotland)	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Control of bacterial growth and abundance in the plankton of Loch Ness, a deep, oligotrophic lake in northern Scotland, UK, was studied over a 12 mo period. Bacterial intrinsic growth rates and grazing loss rates were estimated from dilution experiments. Growth limitation due to resource availability was determined from nutrient addition experiments. Measured bacterial intrinsic growth rates ranged from zero to 0.69 d(-1), these low growth rates being atypical of oligotrophic lakes. Bacterial growth rate was stimulated on different occasions by addition of an organic carbon substrate or by addition of mineral nutrients; however, during summer stratification bacterial growth was principally limited by phosphorus availability. Bacterial growth rate fluctuated irregularly, apparently influenced by the influx of resources from the catchment and hence by rainfall patterns. Bacterial growth rarely responded to increased incubation temperature. Although bacterial growth in Loch Ness was generally slow, new bacterial production was removed quite efficiently by grazers and bacterial densities showed only little fluctuation. Heterotrophic nanoflagellates were sometimes an important component of the bacterivore community, but other grazers such as cladocerans also appeared to play an important role in Loch Ness.

J	Ryder, DS; Horwitz, P				Ryder, DS; Horwitz, P			Seasonal water regimes and leaf litter processing in a wetland on the Swan Coastal Plain, Western Australia	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The effect of seasonal or permanent inundation on the processing of leaf litter from two emergent macrophytes, Baumea artculata and Typha orientalis, was examined at Lake Jandabup, a seasonal wetland on the Swan Coastal Plain. Leaf litter processing was quantified through the loss of organic matter from leaf packs. The contribution made by microorganisms was also examined. Leaf packs exposed to seasonal inundation had significantly higher losses of organic matter after six months than did those permanently inundated, with B. articulata leaf packs losing significantly more. The presence of a diurnally stratified water column in permanently inundated sites in summer, resulting in reduced oxygen concentrations at the bottom of the water column, may be responsible for lower organic matter loss in this environment. These results are supported by the presence of organic-rich soils at permanently inundated sites and their absence at seasonally inundated sites, indicating a long-term pattern of leaf litter processing and wetland water regimes. The distribution of organic-rich soils in wetland basins may provide an indication of long-term water level regimes and can therefore provide a valuable tool for determining water regimes in artificially maintained or restored wetlands.

We analyzed 70 and 120 kHz acoustic data from two lakes with abundant rainbow-smelt (Osmerus mordax) populations. Using repeated surveys through the summer growing season, we derived a relationship between TS (dB) and fish length L (cm) at 120 kHz (TS = 19.9 log(10) L - 67.8). Values for 70 kHz were similar. In situ TS increased with fish density, indicating a bias from accepting multiple targets at high fish densities. Correcting for this bias increased estimates of smelt abundance by up to 18% in Lake Erie and up to 100% in Lake Champlain. Multiple modes in the TS distributions observed for older fish do not reflect different size groups, as the same modes can be observed from measurements from a single fish. Smelt released gas bubbles during the evening ascent, and these bubbles had TS (-60 to -58 dB) within the range of TS observed from the fish. Gas-bubble release occurred mostly during the migration. Conducting surveys after the ascent is completed will decrease bias associated with counting bubbles as fish. (C) 2003 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Brine is one of the important sources of lithium, and the extraction of Li from carbonate-type brine is particularly straightforward. Research into the source of materials and hydrological processes of brine is crucial for the sustainable development of lithium in carbonate-type brine. As a fluid-mobile and metallogenic element, lithium has a significant mass difference between its stable isotopes (7Li and 6Li), leading to isotopic fractionation. In this study, we analyzed the hydrochemistry and Li isotope compositions of samples collected from a Li-rich salt lake (Bangor Co) in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The samples included lake brines, recharge rivers, cold springs, and salt minerals (hydromagnesites). The Li content in the various types of water varied significantly, ranging from 0.06 mg/L to 198.10 mg/L, showing a variation of 4 orders of magnitude. Water samples exhibit a wide range of delta 7Li values, varying from 4.89 parts per thousand to 16.02 parts per thousand. Notably, the lowest and highest values are observed in cold springs. Additionally, the concentrations and delta 7Li values in hydromagnesite differ across various relative ages. The hydrochemistry indicated that the recharge water is influenced by rock weathering, but the lake brine is influenced by evaporation concentration. The analysis of trace elements and Li isotopic data reveals that rock weathering, geothermal systems, salt minerals, and freshwater, primarily from early geothermal activities and the redissolution of carbonate minerals, contribute to the Li in salt lake brine. Boron isotopes and lithium isotopes of lake brines are found to vary differently. The delta 7Li in brine is increased significantly by adsorption of hydromagnesite. And 11B gradually accumulates in hydromagnesite. This study has demonstrated that hydromagnesite plays a crucial role in influencing the characteristics of Li in brine.					he, maoyong/ADO-7723-2022; LI, ZHENGYAN/KCY-9486-2024														2045-2322					APR 7	2025	15	1							11862	10.1038/s41598-025-95913-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-95913-y								40195364					WOS:001465559500020

Gonadal development in pejerrey (Odontesthes bonariensis) during spawning season in relation with sex steroids and temperature variation in Gomez take (Pampas region, Argentina)	ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS												Gomez lake (34 degrees 39 'S 61 degrees 01' W) is a typical shallow lake of Pampas region placed in the upper area of the Salado river. The most abundant fish species in this lake is the pejerrey (Odontesthes bonariensis) valued due to the quality of its flesh and its attractiveness as a game fish. The aim of this study was to describe for the first time in this pejerrey wild population the gonadal stages during three consecutive spawning seasons (August to December) in relation with sexual steroids and temperature in this lake. In general, pejerrey gonadal development, the gonadosomatic index and the plasma levels of estradiol and testosterone varied in relation to air temperature. During the sampling period, pejerrey females started to ovulate in early August (winter), with a peak in October and ending in December with some of them with atretic oocytes. For males, it was possible to find spermiating animals during the whole spawning season and some arrested animals only in December. Our results confirm the relationship with pejerrey maturation and temperature and can be useful for decision making in the management of this natural resource.

We explored the impact of this predator on the levels of a chlorinated hydrocarbon in the pelagic food web through assessments of seasonal abundance and mirex concentrations of Cercopagis pengoi (Ostroumov) and the planktivorous alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus). Abundance, stable isotope, and alewife stomach data indicate that Cercopagis pengoi has become an established portion of the Lake Ontario food web. Cercopagis, a predaceous cladoceran, feeds on the lower portion of the trophic web and is clearly fed upon by the planktivorous alewife. Cercopagis is a link in the Lake Ontario food web, in which energy and materials are being passed from one level of the trophic web to another. However, mirex levels of the planktivorous alewife did not increase during the period of highest Cercopagis abundance. The annual load of mirex (mass of Cercopagis times concentration) transferred from one level of the trophic web to the next is low. In the summer, when Cercopagis is abundant, alewives were not feeding on them.																			0380-1330						2005	31	2					210	218		10.1016/S0380-1330(05)70251-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(05)70251-3													WOS:000230350800008
J	Lemke, AM; Stoeckel, JA; Pegg, MA				Lemke, AM; Stoeckel, JA; Pegg, MA			Utilization of the exotic cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi by juvenile fishes in an Illinois River floodplain lake	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Daphnia lumholtzi comprises a substantial component of the zooplankton community during mid- to late-summer in Lake Chautauqua, a floodplain lake along the Illinois River near Havana, Illinois. In order to quantify the utilization of D. lumholtzi by juvenile fishes, diet analyses were conducted for seven juvenile fish species collected from Lake Chautauqua during the 2001 annual drawdown period. Freshwater drum Aplodinotus grunniens and emerald shiner Notropis atherinoides demonstrated negative selectivity for D. lumholtzi relative to native zooplankton species whereas four species of fish (bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, white bass Morone chrysops, white crappie Pomoxis annularis and black crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus) consumed substantial amounts of D. lumholtzi. Although selectivity values for D. lumholtzi varied among these fish species, positive selection for D. lumholtzi increased similarly among larger size classes of each fish species, and corresponded with ontogenetic shifts in diet. Mean body length of D. lumholtzi consumed by 20-69 mm L-T juvenile fishes ranged from 0.75 to 0.99 mm with a calculated total length range of 2.0-2.6 mm. Results from this study provide evidence that high abundances of D. lumholtzi in mid- to late-summer provide an additional food source for several juvenile fish species during a time when abundances of large native cladoceran species (i.e. Daphnia) are low, and juvenile fishes are searching for larger prey associated with ontogenetic shifts from zooplankton to macroinvertebrates and fishes. Because zooplankton production is typically lower in rivers than in lakes, survivorship of juvenile fishes produced in floodplain lakes may be higher in riverine systems if they are not reliant on zooplankton as a primary food resource. Therefore, high abundances of D. lumholtzi may benefit juvenile fishes in managed floodplain lakes, such as Lake Chautauqua, by increasing growth and facilitating the transition from zooplanktivory to insectivory or piscivory.

It is important to understand the patterns and causes of Holocene climatic changes and their relationship with global changes. Based on the climate proxies and wavelet analysis of Lugu Lake in the ASWM region, the climatic fluctuations and periodic changes in the ASWM region during the Holocene have been reconstructed with a high-precision chronology. The results indicate the intensification of ASWM began to increase with Northern Hemisphere low-latitude solar insolation (LSI) and solar activity during the early Holocene, and gradually decreased during the late Holocene, exhibiting an apparent synchrony with numerous records of ASWM region. Meanwhile, an apparent 1000-a quasi-periodic signal is present in the environment proxies, and it demonstrates that the environmental change in the ASWM region has been driven mainly by LSI and solar activity.					; LEI, Guoliang/B-3707-2008; Zhang, Wenxiang/HZK-0191-2023	Zhang, Wenxiang/0000-0003-3323-3735; 													1367-9120	1878-5786				MAY 1	2018	156						90	95		10.1016/j.jseaes.2018.01.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jseaes.2018.01.003													WOS:000428829700007

Samples of eggs or gonads, muscle, and liver from salmon and lake trout Salvelinus namaycush exhibiting abnormal behaviors were collected to determine the extent to which the behaviors were related to a thiamine deficiency. We compared these values with those found in normally behaving fish that produced offspring with high embryonic survival. In all adult fish exhibiting abnormal behavior, tissue residues of thiamine were among the lowest observed in the Great Lakes. Where embryonic survival was assessed, abnormal adult behavior was also associated with very high levels of offspring mortality due to early mortality syndrome. While the overall ecological significance remains to be determined, it appears that adult fish also exhibit neurological dysfunction and mortality associated with thiamine deficiency.

However, the interaction of the westerlies and the Asian monsoon complicates our understanding of the mechanism of climate variation over the Tibetan Plateau. In this study, we assessed the paleoclimate of Hurleg Lake, which was previously located in the convergence area of the East Asian monsoon and westerly wind. We first reconstructed the climatic conditions based on fined-grained authigenic carbonate delta O-18 (delta O-18(carb)), plant-derived proxies of C/N, and n-alkane-derived delta C-13(31). In the Hurleg Lake, delta O-18(carb) was controlled by delta O-18 changes of the lake water and evaporation. The climate evolution since similar to 16.1 cal kyr BP can be classified into three stages. The Lateglacial (16.1-11.0 cal kyr BP) was characterized by a warm-wet climate in the beginning, followed by a cold-dry climate since 12.0 cal kyr BP. Typical warm and cold phases occurred during 14.8-12.0 cal kyr BP and 12.0-11.1 cal kyr BP, which may correspond to the Bolling/Allerod (B/A) and Younger Dryas periods, respectively. The early to mid-Holocene was generally characterized by a warm-wet climate; however, notable cold-dry intervals occurred at similar to 8.3 cal kyr BP. The Late Holocene (after 4.8 cal kyr BP) displayed a significantly cold-wet climate. Finally, we examined the possible mechanisms responsible for the climate variability in the study area. The results showed that the long-term warm trend in the Lateglacial and colder trend after early Holocene was controlled by insolation. The Asian summer monsoon and the westerlies played a significant role in determining moisture sources during the Lateglacial. The East Asian monsoon contributed greatly to the moisture variation from the early to mid-Holocene, whereas the westerly winds dominated during the late Holocene. Combined, our findings highlight the complex changes in hydroclimate conditions since the last glacial in the Tibetan Plateau and provide crucial implications for comprehending the hydroclimate pattern in the transition zone of westerlies and Asian monsoon.

Linear bubble plume model for hypolimnetic oxygenation: Full-scale validation and sensitivity analysis	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												[ 1] An existing linear bubble plume model was improved, and data collected from a full-scale diffuser installed in Spring Hollow Reservoir, Virginia, were used to validate the model. The depth of maximum plume rise was simulated well for two of the three diffuser tests. Temperature predictions deviated from measured profiles near the maximum plume rise height, but predicted dissolved oxygen profiles compared very well with observations. A sensitivity analysis was performed. The gas flow rate had the greatest effect on predicted plume rise height and induced water flow rate, both of which were directly proportional to gas flow rate. Oxygen transfer within the hypolimnion was independent of all parameters except initial bubble radius and was inversely proportional for radii greater than approximately 1 mm. The results of this work suggest that plume dynamics and oxygen transfer can successfully be predicted for linear bubble plumes using the discrete-bubble approach.

J	Kagami, M; Helmsing, NR; van Donk, E				Kagami, Maiko; Helmsing, Nico R.; van Donk, Ellen			Parasitic chytrids could promote copepod survival by mediating material transfer from inedible diatoms	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Diatoms form large spring blooms in lakes and oceans, providing fuel for higher trophic levels at the start of the growing season. Some of the diatom blooms, however, are not grazed by filter-feeding zooplankton like Daphnia due to their large size. Several of these large diatoms are susceptible to chytrid infections. Zoospores of chytrids appeared to be excellent food for Daphnia, both in terms of size, shape, and quality (PUFAs and cholesterol). Thus, zoospores of chytrids can bridge the gap between inedible diatoms and Daphnia. In order to examine the effects of diatoms and chytrids on the survival of copepods, we performed one grazing and one survival experiment. The grazing experiment revealed that the diatom, Asterionella formosa, was not grazed by the copepod, Eudiaptomus gracilis, even after being infected by the chytrid Zygorhizidium planktonicum. However, carbon and nitrogen concentrations were significantly reduced by E. gracilis only when A. formosa was infected by Z. planktonicum, indicating that the chytrids might facilitate material transfer from inedible diatoms to the copepods. The survival experiment revealed that E. gracilis lived shorter with A. formosa than with the cryptophyta Cryptomonas pyrenoidifera. However, the survival of E. gracilis increased significantly in the treatment where A. formosa cells were infected by Z. planktonicum. Since E. gracilis could not graze A. formosa cells due to their large colonial forms, E. gracilis may acquire nutrients by grazing on the zoospores, and were so able to survive in the presence of the A. formosa. This provides new insights into the role of parasitic fungi in aquatic food webs, where chytrids may improve copepod survival during diatom blooms.

Late Quaternary lahars and lava dams: Fluvial responses of the Upper Tana River (Kenya)	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Geomorphological and sedimentary records near the confluences of the Tana River and major tributaries draining the eastern slopes of Mt. Kenya and the Nyambeni Range, indicate impacts of Late Quaternary volcanic activity in their fluvial records. The main reconstructed event was triggered by a 366.9 ka basalt flow (40Ar/39Ar dated) which flowed along Kazita River from the Nyambeni Range blocking both Kazita River and Tana River near Kibuka Grand Falls, causing a temporary lake. Consequently, Tana River and Kazita River started to build volcanoclastic Gilbert type deltas. The preserved pro-delta sediments rich in trachytic pumice fragments display a mineralogical and age match with known Ithanguni trachytic tuffs, indicating delta build up right after a contemporary Ithanguni eruption. This trachytic eruption caused the deposition of lahars and fluvial volcaniclastic sediments in all river records draining the Eastern side of Mt. Kenya. The multiple lahars seem to be triggered by eruptions under glacial conditions (basalt age indicates MIS 10). The lava dammed lake was only short lived (estimated to have lasted only a few years to decades) and breached before a complete lake infill could occur. The current Kibuka Grand Falls can be viewed as the delayed incisional response of this lava dam breach, indicating that after >366.9 ka, Tana River is still responding and adjusting to this short-lived disruptive phase. The current Kazita River has re-incised adjacent to a MIS 4 basalt flow down into the crystalline Basement System rocks. The MIS 10 pre-volcanic sedimentary record indicates that more sediments were in the fluvial system during glacial conditions than during the interglacial conditions. An implication of our reconstruction is that the Late Quaternary fluvial record of Tana River is of only limited use to reconstruct uplift rates because reconstructed Quaternary incision rates are reflecting both volcanic disruptions as climate change trends of aridification and decreasing glaciation extents.

Both species consumed predominantly (> 71 % by number) zooplankton, showing a preference for larger taxa. Diet overlap between the two species was low (Schoener's index = 0.42). Mysis was most important in rainbow smelt diets, whereas Diaptomus sicilis was most important in lake herring diets. Rainbow smelt selected larger taxa, and larger individuals within a taxon when compared to take herring, although rainbow smelt tended to be smallerfish. Fish diets have changed relative to previous studies and may be reflecting changes in the zooplankton community. Continued changes in the fish and zooplankton community will alter predatorprey and energetic pathways, ultimately affecting growth and production of the ecosystem.																			0380-1330						2004	30			1			407	413		10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70401-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70401-3													WOS:000227991500029

Species- and size-specific fish predation on recently established invasive quagga mussels Dreissena rostriformis bugensis Andrusov 1897 in a large, deep oligotrophic lake	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Since its first appearance in Lake Constance in 2016 the invasive quagga mussel Dreissena rostriformis bugensis has come to dominate the mussel community and now occurs in hyperabundant densities over the whole lake bottom. A lake-wide field study was conducted between 2019 and 2020 to obtain a systematic insight into the importance of this novel source of potential prey for the native fish community. In total 664 fish of 20 different species were caught and their digestive tracts were analysed. Meanwhile, quagga mussels were sampled to assess their calorific energy value by size and season. Regressions of septum length on maximum valve length were used to evaluate size-specific mussel consumption by the three dominant quagga-eating fish species. The study shows that nearly all benthivorous fish are able to forage efficiently on quaggas. However, in the case of one keystone species with very high commercial interest, the benthic whitefish Coregonus spp., quagga consumption is more limited as only individuals larger than 35 cm consumed quaggas in relevant amounts. The energy content of quagga mussels is positively size dependent with seasonal effect and elevated values during summer for medium- and large-sized mussels.

However, there is a limited understanding of the magnitude of these temperature fluctuations in continental regions, and questions remain about the seasonal signal of these climate events. This study presents a 60 000-year-long temperature reconstruction based on branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) extracted from lake sediments from the Eifel Volcanic Field, Germany. brGDGTs are bacterial membrane-spanning lipids that are known to have a strong relationship with temperature, making them suitable for temperature reconstructions. We test several temperature calibration models on modern samples taken from soils and multiple maar lakes. We find a negative bias in brGDGT-based temperature estimates associated with water depth and anoxic conditions that can be corrected for by accounting for a brGDGT isomer that is only produced in anoxic conditions. The corrected temperature reconstruction correlates with proxy and climate model estimates of temperature spanning the same time period, validating the calibration approach we selected. However, millennial-scale variability is significantly dampened in the brGDGT record, and in contrast to other Northern Hemisphere climate records, during several Heinrich stadials, temperatures actually increase. We demonstrate that these apparent discrepancies can be explained by the unique seasonal response of the brGDGT paleothermometer to temperatures of months above freezing (TMAF). Our data support the view that warm-season temperatures in Europe varied minimally during the last glacial period and that abrupt millennial-scale events were defined by colder, longer winters. Our continuous high-resolution temperature reconstruction provides important information about the magnitude of seasonal climate variability during the last glacial period that can be used to test climate models and inform studies of paleoecological change.

J	GIBBS, MM				GIBBS, MM			INFLUENCE OF HYPOLIMNETIC STIRRING AND UNDERFLOW ON THE LIMNOLOGY OF LAKE ROTOITI, NEW-ZEALAND	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The limnology of Lake Rotoiti (North Island) is profoundly modified by the effects of an underflowing density current and geothermally induced hypolimnetic stirring. The underflowing density current results in the periodic and seasonally intermittent intrusion of eutrophic water from nearby Lake Rotorua into the eastern basin of Lake Rotoiti. Although this water is causing the long-term degradation of the water quality of the lake (Vincent et al. 1984, 1991), the immediate impact has both beneficial as well as detrimental effects on the lake. The intruding water initiated a midwater column algal bloom through advection of an algal inoculum from Lake Rotorua but reduced the rate of hypolimnetic deoxygenation through advection of oxygen. Geothermally induced hypolimnetic stirring tended to destabilise the water column, disrupting early stratification. The intermittent cycles of stratification and mixing transported oxygen and solar energy downwards, reducing hypolimnetic deoxygenation while rapidly heating the hypolimnion in spring. When stratification became established, the stirring maintained an isothermal hypolimnion and assisted the rapid dispersion of nutrients released from the sediments throughout the hypolimnion. Consequently, the processes of hypolimnetic oxygen depletion, nitrification of ammonia to nitrate, and the subsequent denitrification occurred uniformly throughout the hypolimnion rather than with intensity progressively decreasing from the sediments upwards.																			0028-8330						1992	26	3-4					453	463		10.1080/00288330.1992.9516538	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1992.9516538													WOS:A1992KK79900015

Features of acid-saline systems of Southern Australia	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY					7th International Symposium on Environmental Geochemistry	DEC, 2006	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA					The discovery of layered, SO4-rich sediments on the Meridiani Planum on Mars has focused attention on understanding the formation of acid-saline lakes. Many salt lakes have formed in southern Australia where regional groundwaters are characterized by acidity and high salinity and show features that might be expected in the Meridiani sediments. Many (but not all) of the acid-saline Australian groundwaters are found where underlying Tertiary sediments are sulfide-rich. When waters from the formations come to the surface or interact with oxidised meteoric water, acid groundwaters result. In this paper examples of such waters around Lake Tyrrell, Victoria, and Lake Dey-Dey, South Australia, are reviewed. The acid-saline groundwaters typically have dissolved solids of 30-60 g/L and pH commonly <45. Many contain high concentrations of Fe and other metals, leached from local sediments. The combination of acidity and salinity also releases Ra. Around salt-lakes, these acidic waters often emerge at the surface in marginal spring zones where the low density (rho similar to 1.04) regional water flows out over the denser (rho similar to 1.16) lake brines. In the spring zones examined, large amounts of Fe are commonly precipitated. In a few places minerals of the alunite-jarosite family are formed which can trap many other metals, including Ra. The studied groundwater systems were discovered by U exploration programs following up radiometric anomalies related to this Ra. Evaporation concentrates the lesser soluble salts (gypsum and some halite) on the surface of the lakes. The lake brines contain most of the more soluble salts and form a column within the porous sediments which is held in place by hydrostatic forces around the salt-lake. These brines are near-neutral in pH. These observations are in contrast to the jarosite-bearing aeolianites found on the Meridiani Planum, Mars. These have an almost homogeneous distribution of Fe oxides and jarosite, with little separation of salts with different solubilities (CaSO4 and MgSO4) or differential separation of elements with differing solubility (K, Na, Ti, Cr). Thus, it is considered unlikely that groundwaters or evaporative salt-lake systems, as found on earth, were involved. Instead, these features point to a water-poor system with local alteration and very little mobilization of elements. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, their role in shaping the regional groundwater flow in watersheds with pull-apart basins remains poorly understood. This study aimed to clarify the hydrological impacts of a strike-slip fault within a watershed featuring a pull-apart basin at its lowest point. To achieve this, the groundwater table levels were monitored, and samples of spring water, groundwater in the pull-apart basin, river water, and precipitation were analyzed for water quality, isotope ratios, and SF6 concentrations. The results reveal that while regional groundwater flow predominantly extends from high-elevation areas toward the lake, groundwater flow into the pull-apart basin is largely impeded by strike-slip faults and a thick impermeable silt layer. Isotope analyses indicate that the groundwater in the basin originates from mountainous areas adjacent to the basin rather than from upstream zones, has a long residence time, and is influenced by volcanic activity. Importantly, this study supports previous findings that strike-slip faults act as barriers but are permeable in deeper parts. However, the detection of SF6 in groundwater in the mountain-plain transitional zone indicates that not all mountain groundwater reaching the fault zone flows to the deep subsurface, and some directly recharges the basin groundwater. Furthermore, the results suggest a non-continuous groundwater flow system at the Mt. Yatsu foot spring and Suwa pull-apart basin, with the possibility of groundwater flowing out of the watershed in a direction opposite to river flow. These findings demonstrate that geological structures, particularly strike-slip faults, play a pivotal role in determining groundwater flow paths and recharge zones; and challenge the conventional assumption that topography alone defines watershed hydrology. This study highlights the need for integrated geological and hydrological approaches for understanding and managing groundwater systems in tectonically active regions.

An automated method to monitor lake ice phenology	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												A simple method to automatically measure the date of ice-on, the date of ice-off, and the duration of lake ice cover is described. The presence of ice cover is detected by recording water temperature just below the ice/water interface and just above the lake bottom using moored temperature sensors. The occurrence of ice-on rapidly leads to detectible levels of inverse stratification, defined as existing when the upper sensor records a temperature at least 0.1 degrees C below that of the bottom sensor, whereas the occurrence of ice-off leads to the return of isothermal mixing. Based on data from 10 lakes over a total of 43 winter seasons, we found that the timing and duration of inverse stratification monitored by recording temperature sensors compares well with ice cover statistics based on human observation. The root mean square difference between the observer-based and temperature-based estimates was 7.1 d for ice-on, 6.4 d for ice-off, and 10.0 d for the duration of ice cover. The coefficient of determination between the two types of estimates was 0.93, 0.86, and 0.91, respectively. The availability of inexpensive self-contained temperature loggers should allow expanded monitoring of ice cover in a large and diverse array of lakes. Such monitoring is needed to improve our ability to monitor the progression of global climate change, and to improve our understanding of the relationship between climate and ice cover over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales.					; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/Y-6135-2019	Arvola, Lauri/0000-0003-1380-0659; Blenckner, Thorsten/0000-0002-6991-7680; 													1541-5856					FEB	2011	9						74	83		10.4319/lom.2010.9.0074	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lom.2010.9.0074													WOS:000290678500004
J	Zale, AV; Adornato, TG				Zale, AV; Adornato, TG			Comparative influences of abiotic variables on seasonal abundances of hybrid striped bass and white bass in the Grand Lake tailwater, Oklahoma	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												We sampled hybrid striped bass Morone saxatilis female x M. chrysops male and white bass M. chrysops in the Pensacola Dam tailwater of Grand Lake, Oklahoma, using gill nets at about monthly intervals from January 1988 to July 1989 to assess temporal changes in their abundances in the tailwater and to determine and compare relations between their abundances and changes in selected abiotic variables. Hybrid striped bass and white bass moved into the tailwater during spring and dispersed downstream after the spawning season. Abundances of hybrid striped bass were associated with dam discharge volumes during the month prior to sampling water temperatures of 15-16 degrees C, and photoperiod intervals of 825-850 min of daylight. Peak white bass abundances were associated with water temperatures of 13 degrees C, photoperiod intervals of 800 min, and dam discharges during the preceding month. Dissolved oxygen concentration had no significant effect on either fish. During periods of peak abundance, both taxa were most abundant immediately below the dam, inferring that blockage of further upstream movement was responsible for concentration of these fish in the tailwater. Overall, the associations of hybrid striped bass and white bass with abiotic variables were very similar.																			0270-5060					SEP	1996	11	3					257	269		10.1080/02705060.1996.9664448	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1996.9664448													WOS:A1996VM97000002

Thermocline deepening and mixing alter zooplankton phenology, biomass and body size in a whole-lake experiment	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Summer thermal stratification is thought to be one of the key structuring physical factors for north temperate lake zooplankton. Shifts associated with climate change may lead to altered thermocline depths in stratified lakes through changes to (i) wind stress and associated water column mixing or (ii) air temperature and precipitation. The effects of thermocline deepening through these two scenarios were simulated in a whole-lake experiment to assess the effects on the phenology, biomass and mean body size of the zooplankton. The thermocline of a three-basin dimictic lake was deepened to 7-8m in one basin using a lake mixer. Through heat transfer, the thermocline of the adjacent basin was deepened to 6-7m, while the third basin served as an unmanipulated control (4-5m deep thermocline). Zooplankton community dynamics were followed weekly in a control year and in two experimental years. A before-after-control-impact (BACI) statistical protocol was used to assess the effects of two treatments: Deepening and Deepening+Mixing. Thermocline depth was the main factor influencing zooplankton changes. The biomass and late-season dominance by smaller-bodied and more fish-evasive species were favoured by deepening, leading to a decline in mean community body size, but an increase in total biomass. While many effects could be attributed to thermocline deepening, additional or exacerbated responses were observed when mixing was also present. This resulted mostly from a loss of the hypolimnetic refuge for zooplankton, which accentuated predation effects by warm-water fish on larger cladocerans. Overall, our treatments promoted top-down (predation) effects that increased over the 2years of the experiment.

Long Term Effects of Climate on Two Pond Predators	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												This study assessed the influence of annual snowpack on long term changes in the predatory regime of four high elevation ponds in the mountains of northwest Wyoming. Over 36 y of observation, in two ponds the primary predator alternated between phantom midge Chaoborus americanus larvae and Diaptomus shoshone predatory copepods, whereas the predatory regime did not change in the other two shallower ponds. Switching of predators correlated with extreme amounts of winter snow, either high or low, which determined the depth at which drying or complete freezing of the pond occurred. Chaoborus americanus colonized ponds after the wettest years and disappeared after the driest years. The results provide an unusual long term perspective of the effects of weather on predator dominance.

Using Daphnia magna and Daphnia pulex as models, the effects of food supply and temperature on the ingestion of polystyrene spheres (diameter 1 mu m, concentration of 200 ng*ml(-1)) was analysed. The ingestion rates of microplastic beads were increased in conditions of low food and high temperatures, reflecting the complex regulation patterns of the water current generated by the animals' thoracic limbs. Maximal enrichment of 1160 times the concentration in the ambient medium was observed within one hour. Analyses of the impact of microplastic ingestion on physiological parameters used the carbohydrate concentration as an indicator for the animals' metabolic state. Exposure to the microplastic beads for three days in the presence or absence of Desmodesmus subspicatus did not affect the animals' glycogen reserves beyond the response to the prevailing food and temperature conditions. Projecting the insights from laboratory experiments to the habitat situation, increased burdens of microplastic particles can be expected in filtering zooplankton organisms in warm water and scarce supply of food, like the clear-water phase of lakes in the summer.

Superimposed upon a smooth pattern of local sea-level rise, acceleration occurred ca. 7600 calibrated (cal) yr B.P., evidenced as a nearly synchronous flooding in six elevated basins ranging from 3.0 to 7.2 m above present sea level. We ascribe this rapid local sea-level rise of similar to 4.5 m to a sudden increase in ocean mass, most likely caused by the final decay of the Labrador sector of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The subsequent monotonic fall of local sea level from ca. 6500 cal yr B.P. to the present is mainly an expression of the slow isostatic adjustment of the mantle.																			0091-7613	1943-2682				OCT	2007	35	10					891	894		10.1130/G23859A.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G23859A.1													WOS:000250102800007

The water of the reservoir is primarily used for domestic, drinking, and irrigation. Water quality of the reservoir was monitored at five locations during pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons in 2017-2018 to understand spatiotemporal variation and also, the suitability of water for existing uses. A hydro-geochemical analysis of reservoir water was undertaken with the help of Piper Diagram, Schoeller-Berkaloff diagram, Stiff diagram, U.S Salinity Laboratory diagram, Water Quality Index, Salinity Index, Sodium Percentage, Sodium Absorption Ratio, Magnesium Hazard, etc. The hydrochemical facies in the present study showed that water was of Ca-HCO3 water type. Factor analysis revealed two predominating factors, both geogenic in nature, that influenced reservoir water quality, accounting for 81.992 % of the variance in data. Slight variation in water quality was observed with time and space but it was non- significant statistically. Water Quality Index had increasing trends at three sites from monsoon to pre-monsoon through post-monsoon and winter seasons.

INSIGHTS FROM SFERK, KLINA, KOSOVO	ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION ENGINEERING												This study investigates the analysis of heavy metal content, as well as the physical and chemical properties of water and sediment in the artificial lake situated in Sferk, Klina, Kosovo. Sampling and analysis were conducted during the autumn of 2023. The inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) technique was employed to measure the levels of heavy metals. The contamination factors (CF) were calculated to evaluate the degree of heavy metal pollution. At the same time, the spatial interpolation technique (spatial resolution 1 m) in QGIS software was developed to spatially represent the distribution of heavy metals and other parameters across the study area. The results for water and sediment samples were compared with the WHO and EPA standards. The findings indicate significant variations in heavy metal concentrations, highlighting potential sources of contamination. CF calculations offer insights into pollution levels, assisting in identifying priority areas for remediation efforts, particularly in water samples.

Our study area includes 14 watersheds with a range of land uses throughout the U.S. Great Lakes Basin. We develop annual seasonal load-discharge regression models for each watershed and apply these models with simulated discharges generated for future climate scenarios to simulate future P loading patterns for two periods: 2046-2065 and 2081-2100. We utilize output from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 downscaled climate change projections that are input into the Large Basin Runoff Model to generate future discharge scenarios, which are in turn used as inputs to the seasonal P load regression models. In almost all cases, the seasonal load-discharge models match observed loads better than the annual models. Results using the seasonal models show that the concurrence of nonlinearity in the load-discharge model and changes in high discharges in the spring months leads to the most significant changes in P loading for selected tributaries under future climate projections. These results emphasize the importance of using seasonal models to understand the effects of future climate change on nutrient loads.

J	Chand, MB; Watanabe, T				Chand, Mohan Bahadur; Watanabe, Teiji			Development of Supraglacial Ponds in the Everest Region, Nepal, between 1989 and 2018	REMOTE SENSING												Several supraglacial ponds are developing and increasing in size and number in the Himalayan region. They are the precursors of large glacial lakes and may become potential for glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Recently, GLOF events originating from supraglacial ponds were recorded; however, the spatial, temporal, and seasonal distributions of these ponds are not well documented. We chose 23 debris-covered glaciers in the Everest region, Nepal, to study the development of supraglacial ponds. We used historical Landsat images (30-m resolution) from 1989 to 2017, and Sentinel-2 (10-m resolution) images from 2016 to 2018 to understand the long-term development and seasonal variations of these ponds. We also used fine-resolution (0.5-2 m) WorldView and GeoEye imageries to reveal the high-resolution inventory of these features and these images were also used as references for accuracy assessments. We observed a continuous increase in the area and number of ponds from 1989-2017, with minor fluctuations. Similarly, seasonal variations were observed at the highest ponded area in the pre- and postmonsoon seasons, and lowest ponded area in the winter season. Substantial variations of the ponds were also observed among glaciers corresponding to their size, slope, width, moraine height, and elevation. The persistency and densities of the ponds with sizes >0.005 km(2) were found near the glacier terminuses. Furthermore, spillway lakes on the Ngozompa, Bhote Koshi, Khumbu, and Lumsamba glaciers were expanding at a faster rate, indicating a trajectory towards large lake development. Our analysis also found that Sentinel-2 (10-m resolution) has good potential to study the seasonal changes of supraglacial ponds, while fine-resolution (<2 m) imagery is able to map the supraglacial ponds with high accuracy and can help in understanding the surrounding morphology of the glacier.

A Classification of Stream Water Temperature Regimes in the Conterminous USA	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Temporal variability in water temperature plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems, yet the thermal regime of streams has mainly been described in terms of mean or extreme conditions. In this study, annual and diel variability in stream water temperature was described at 135 unregulated, gauged streams across the USA. Based on magnitude, amplitude and timing characteristics of daily water temperature records ranging from 5 to 33years, we classified thermal regimes into six distinct types. This classification underlined the importance of including characteristics of variability (amplitude and timing) in addition to aspects of magnitude to discriminate thermal regimes at the continental scale. We used a classification tree to predict thermal regime membership of the six classes and found that the annual mean and range in the long-term air temperature average along with spring flows were important variables defining the thermal regime types at the continental scale. This research provides a framework for a comprehensive characterization of the thermal regimes of streams that could provide a basis for future assessment of changes in water temperature caused by anthropogenic activities such as dams, land use changes and climate change.

J	Sutherland, DL; Hawes, I				Sutherland, Donna L.; Hawes, Ian			Annual growth layers as proxies of past growth conditions for benthic microbial mats in a perennially ice-covered Antarctic lake	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Perennial microbial mats can be the dominant autotrophic community in Antarctic lakes. Their seasonal growth results in clearly discernible annual growth layering. We examined features of live microbial mats from a range of depths in Lake Hoare, Antarctica, that are likely to be preserved in these layers to determine their potential as proxies of past growth performance. Cyanobacteria dominated the mat for all but the deepest depth sampled. Changes in areal concentrations of phycobilin pigments, organic matter and extracellular polysaccharide and in species composition did not correspond to changes in various water column properties, but showed a linear relationship with irradiance. Carbonate accumulation in the mats correlated with biomass markers and may be inferred as an index of mat performance. We examined the carbonate content of annual layers laid down from 1958-1959 to 1994-1995 in sediment cores from 12 m depth. The carbonate content in the layer showed a significant correlation with the mean summer air temperature. These data suggest a link between air temperature and microbial mat growth performance, and suggest that it is mediated via irradiance. Laminated microbial mats in Antarctic lakes have the potential to act as fine-resolution records of environmental conditions in the recent past, although interpretation is complex.

Hyalella azteca was present in 69 of 71 nonacidified lakes, and absent in 8 of 8 lakes which either are now or recently were considered acidified. Bioassay data indicate a 96-h LC50 of pH 4.4 and a 10-d threshold LC50 of pH 4.5 for H. azteca in a natural surface water. Hyalella azteca is extremely rare in Plastic Lake, which undergoes severe short-term acidification in spring, and recruitment is delayed 2 wk in Heeney Lake which undergoes similar short-term acidification. In Dickie, Harp, Red Chalk, and Blue Chalk lakes, where springtime pH depressions below pH 4.7 were not recorded, H. azteca is abundant.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				FEB	1986	43	2					288	292		10.1139/f86-037	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f86-037													WOS:A1986A159800006

This study investigates the evolution of geomorphic units and their connectivity, from upstream piedmont to downstream salt lake, since the late Quaternary in the Golmud River catchment of the eastern Kunlun Mountains (KLM). The study aims to elucidate the debate over linkages between: (1) landform evolution and paleoclimatic change and (2) dynamic geomorphic processes and lake evolution in the lower basin. Based on geomorphic and sedimentological observations and an optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) chronology, we show three main phases of geomorphic processes: (1) upstream piedmont alluvial fans and an alluvial delta fan at the salt lake margin have surface sediment OSL ages of 12.8-11.4 ka, suggesting a valley aggradation stage in which mass periglacial detritus were eroded and redeposited in the drainage basin; (2) incision terraces in alluvial valley fills provide ages between 11.4 and 8.8, 8.1-6.2, and 4.9-3.9 ka. Incision is ascribed to the reduction in supply of detritus owing to glacial recession and enhanced precipitation in the early to middle Holocene; and (3) widely distributed swamp sediments in the distal delta fan date to 32-1.8 ka, suggesting a wetter stage within the late Holocene climatic deterioration. Loess, indicative of aridity, was deposited intermittently during the middle to late Holocene. We reconstructed a wetness index, based on wetness scores of drainage geomorphic units, which is consistent with published moisture proxies. This association implies that (1) landform processes in KLM responded well to precipitation fluctuations in Indian summer monsoon (ISM) dominant regions, indicating their climatic forcing and (2) precipitation variations in the eastern KLM have been mainly controlled by ISM intensity since 12.8 ka. Linking the geomorphologic evolution of mountain-basin systems to downstream arid basin evolution shows that the periods of fluvial terrace incision (early to middle Holocene) were probably important sources of lake salt mineral enrichment. The landscape evolution patterns of mountain-basin systems in the eastern KLM offer a model for assessing the linkages between geomorphic processes, paleoclimatic changes, and lake evolution in other arid regions.

Measuring Atmospheric CO2 Enhancements From the 2017 British Columbia Wildfires Using a Lidar	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												During the summer 2017 ASCENDS/ABoVE airborne science campaign, the NASA Goddard CO2 Sounder lidar overflew smoke plumes from wildfires in the British Columbia, Canada. In the flight path over Vancouver Island on 8 August 2017, the column XCO2 retrievals from the lidar measurements at flight altitudes around 9 km showed an average enhancement of 4 ppm from the wildfires. A comparison of these enhancements with those from the Goddard Global Chemistry Transport model suggested that the modeled CO2 emissions from wildfires were underestimated by more than a factor of 2. A spiral-down validation performed at Moses Lake airport, Washington showed a bias of 0.1 ppm relative to in situ measurements and a standard deviation of 1 ppm in lidar XCO2 retrievals. The results show that future airborne campaigns and spaceborne missions with this type of lidar can improve estimates of CO2 emissions from wildfires and estimates of carbon fluxes globally.

Bioaccumulation of heavy metals in different organs of Labeo rohita, Pangasius hypophthalmus, and Katsuwonus pelamis from Visakhapatnam, India	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												The bioaccumulation of heavy metals (Zn, Pb, Cd, Co, Cu, and Fe) in fish tissues was determined using Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (spectra 220) and Mercury (Hg) content was estimated by using a mercury analyzer. Various organs (eye, gill, gut, gonad, liver, skin, and muscle) of three fish species, i.e., Labeo rohita, Pangasius hypophthalmus and Katsuwonus pelamis, from Visakhapatnam were analyzed. Young and aged fish were chosen based on their length: LR-32, LR-49 (Rohu); PH-33, PH-56 (Pangasius); and KP-18, KP-52 (Skipjack). In both the small and big size of L. rohita and P. hypophthalmus, the metal concentration was in the order Fe > Zn > Cu whereas Pb, Hg, and Co were below detectable limit (BDL). Concentrations in K. pelamis was Fe > Zn > Cu > Cd and Pb, Hg, and Co were BDL. In conclusion, the metal concentrations in the examined fish species available in Visakhapatnam fall below the maximum permissible limit (MPL) for human consumption recommended by FAO, WHO, MAFF, and EC.					; Sundar Raj, Dinesh Kumar/I-4111-2012	Sundarraj, Dinesh Kumar/0000-0001-8949-2571; 													0025-326X	1879-3363				AUG	2020	157								111326	10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.111326	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.111326								32658691					WOS:000548531100009

Post-translocation telemetry can assess success by identifying activity, emigrations, survival, habitat usage, and reproductive events, aiding in the continued management of translocated populations and informing future efforts. This study assessed movement of translocated adult lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) immediately post-release and a decade later, and tested for associations between environmental variables and spawning movements. Prior to their translocation in 2002, 13 of 51 adult lake sturgeon were surgically implanted with radio telemetry tags and tracked for 1 year. In 2011 and 2013, eight additional adults were captured within the reintroduction site and implanted with radio-tags. Six of the 13 sturgeon tagged in 2002 dispersed downstream over a dam during the early post-release period. In spring 2014, tagged adults were tracked to the spillway at the release area's inflow, and spawning was confirmed by larval captures. Movement data for tagged adults differed between the two tracking periods, showing marked differences in behaviour over time. Water velocity was correlated with upstream and downstream spawning movements, with water temperature also correlated with downstream movement. Research regarding post-translocation movement and dispersal provides insight on behavioural responses following translocation, and may improve outcomes by informing future efforts.					; Wilson, Chris/J-4851-2012; Haxton, Tim/H-7857-2019	Boothroyd, Maggie/0000-0002-7305-7492; Wilson, Chris/0000-0002-9528-0652; Haxton, Tim/0000-0002-9767-3986													0175-8659	1439-0426				FEB	2019	35	1					103	116		10.1111/jai.13872	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.13872													WOS:000459917600015
J	Dvorak, J				Dvorak, J			An example of relationships between macrophytes, macroinvertebrates and their food resources in a shallow eutrophic lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The late-spring quantitative relationship between epiphyton and macroinvertebrates was analyzed on the basis of units of colonizable plant surface of Typha angustifolia, Phragmites australis and Nuphar lutea (floating leaves) in the shallow euthrophic Lake Loosdrecht (the Netherlands), with a high seston load. The non-predatory chironomid larvae (Glyptotendipes viridis, Endochironomus albipennis, Pentapedilum sordens, Cricotopus sylvestris agg.) dominated among the macroinvertebrate taxa, controlling the diversity and resemblance of macroinvertebrate assemblages. There was a gradient in functional feeding groups among the chironomids from continuous filtering of the seston to prevailing utilization of epiphyton. We found no direct relationship between the total macroinvertebrate abundance and the epiphyton mass on the plants surface. We attribute this to the filter feeding-strategy of the most abundant species, Glyptotendipes viridis, that utilizes seston in the eutrophicated lake.																			0018-8158					NOV 15	1996	339	1-3					27	36		10.1007/BF00008910	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008910													WOS:A1996WC90400005

Mean assimilation efficiency of (CH3HgCl)-Hg-203 from tadpoles was 96%. For the majority of the 50 experimental crayfish (three size-classes of males and females designated small, medium, and large), no significant loss of assimilated (CH3HgCl)-Hg-203 was evident over the 166-day monitoring period. When a significant loss of (CH3HgCl)-Hg-203 was detected, observed half-lives usually fell within 1000-2000 days (3-5 years). The high assimilation efficiency and slow depuration rate imply that crayfish can biomagnify CH3Hg from their food.																			0706-652X					DEC	1996	53	12					2862	2869		10.1139/cjfas-53-12-2862	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-53-12-2862													WOS:A1996WL12500020

Reconstructing past temperature change on the TP provides a valuable context for assessing the current and possible future status of glaciers. However, the quantitative paleotemperature records since the last deglaciation on the TP are sparse. Moreover, existing records have revealed a conflicting Holocene temperature variation patterns on the northeastern and western TP. Quantitative temperature records on the central TP would be essential for a better understanding of the spatiotemporal complexity of temperature variation. In this study, we report the temperature record from the sedimentary record of lake Linggo Co on the central TP since the last deglaciation using branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers based proxy. Our results indicate that the paleoclimate during the last deglaciation on the central TP was characterized by large fluctuations in temperature. The mean annual temperature of lake Linggo Co remained low during the early Holocene (11.7-10 ka BP) and gradually increased to 4 degrees C at 8.3 ka, rapidly declining to -2 degrees C on average toward the present day. Solar radiation, continental glacier feedback, as well as atmosphere circulation play a major role in the distribution of sensitive and latent heat, thus affecting the Holocene temperature variability of the TP. Discrepancies in published records on the TP can result from a seasonal bias of the proxies and spatial differences due to topography-boundary effect. Our results suggest that the seasonal bias of proxies, the spatiotemporal difference should be taken into consideration before regional or global synthesis of paleotemperature records.

Soil loss is often nonlinear, involving a rapid deterioration from a stable eco-geomorphic state once a tipping point is reached. Soil loss thresholds have been studied at plot scale, but for landscapes, quantitative constraints on the necessary and sufficient conditions for tipping points are rare. Here, we document a landscape-wide eco-geomorphic tipping point at the edge of the Tibetan Plateau and quantify its drivers and erosional consequences. We show that in the upper Kali Gandaki valley, Nepal, soil formation prevailed under wetter conditions during much of the Holocene. Our data suggest that after a period of human pressure and declining vegetation cover, a 20% reduction of relative humidity and precipitation below 200 mm/year halted soil formation after 1.6 ka and promoted widespread gullying and rapid soil loss, with irreversible consequences for ecosystem services.

J	Nesje, A; Dahl, SO; Lie, O				Nesje, A; Dahl, SO; Lie, O			Holocene millennial-scale summer temperature variability inferred from sediment parameters in a non-glacial mountain lake: Danntjorn, Jotunheimen central southern Norway	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS					IMAGES Holocene Working Group Workshop	AUG 27-30, 2003	Hafslo, NORWAY	NOAA Climate Change Data & Detect Program, Swiss Natl Sci Fdn				Holocene changes in summer temperature in the Jotunheimen area have been inferred from variations in several sediment parameters from a composite (combined from two overlapping sediment cores) lake-core record (mean time resolution of similar to15 years) from Lake Danntjorn, a small mountain lake located close to the modern pine-tree limit in Jotunheimen, central southern Norway. Loss-on-ignition analysis at contiguous 0.5-cm intervals throughout the cores revealed that the variations in residue after ignition of the sediments at 550degreesC in the upper 260 cm (similar to8500 calendar years) were not associated with variations in magnetic susceptibility. In the basal, deglacial and early Holocene sequence of the lake sediments, however, the two sediment parameters fluctuated mainly in phase. In addition, the biogenic silica (BSi) concentration is relatively high. Thus, in the early part of the Holocene, the variations in the residue were probably primarily driven by input of minerogenic, detrital material (inwash and/or windblown) and biological productivity (including BSi from diatoms) in the lake itself and in the lake surroundings. From approximately 8500 calendar years BP, variations in the residue probably primarily reflect variations in low-minerogenic (low magnetic susceptibility with little variations) and diatom (BSi) productivity, as demonstrated with analysis of BSi concentration between 260 and 233 cm (similar to8500-7760 calendar years BP). The highest residue values (probably mainly reflecting high diatom productivity) occurred at 7800-7200, 7000, 6700, 6200, 5400-5050, 4300, 2500, 1800, 1550, 900, 700, and < 100 calendar years BP. The most significant < 8000 calendar years BP residue minima (mainly low diatom productivity) were recorded at 7100, 6800, 6600, 6000-5700, 5000-4400, 4200, 3800, 3600, 3200, 3000, 2750, 2300, 1900, 1700, 1070, 740, 600, 380, and 80 calendar years BP (BP = AD 2000). The lake record from Jotunheimen is discussed in the context of Holocene terrestrial and marine records from the North Atlantic region and possible natural climate forcing factors.

Due to urbanization many of the dyeing units have shifted from urban to nearby rural areas. Here safe disposal of untreated effluent from the dyeing units is a challenge and is often let into nearby water bodies. Pandravedu Lake, located in Thiruvallur district of Tamil Nadu, India is one such case were the present study is carried out. Water samples were collected from twelve locations during premonsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, in pre-cleaned polyethylene cans and analyzed for physicochemical parameters like pH, total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, total alkalinity, total hardness, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, iron, nitrate, chloride, fluoride and sulphate following the standard analytical procedures recommended by American Public Health Association (2005). The analytical results indicated that 40% to 70% of samples exceeded the drinking water quality standards prescribed by Bureau of Indian standards (BIS, 2012). Water quality index computed indicate that both the bore wells that supply drinking water to the village falls in very poor category (101 - 150) across three seasons. Correlation analysis indicated that seasonal changes in correlation among the parameters are linked to the fluctuations of wastewater discharge and its characteristics.																			1790-7632					SEP	2017	19	2					225	231																WOS:000412801100001

Middle to Late Miocene Eccentricity Forcing on Lake Expansion in NE Tibet	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) variability on orbital time scale has been extensively investigated in Quaternary loess and speleothems. However, EASM variability during pre-Quaternary time remains poorly understood. Here we report a continuous upper Miocene cyclostratigraphic record from lake deposits of the Tianshui basin, Northeast Tibet, to reconstruct past variations of the regional hydrological cycle. Our results, combined with previously published cyclostratigraphic records from Northeast Tibet, show that regional lake expansion cycles have been consistently dominated by similar to 100-kyr eccentricity forcing over most of the middle to late Miocene. These similar to 100 kyr cycles corroborate a significant forcing of the East Asian hydrological cycle by Antarctic ice sheet variations at that time. It is, however, unclear if this forcing affected EASM intensity or westerly derived moisture supply to the far east. Regardless of the nature of the main source of precipitation in Northeast Tibet during the Miocene, these results emphasize the existence of a strong teleconnection between Antarctic ice sheet modulations and the continental climate of Asia.

Monitoring and forecasting of corn yields in this intensive agricultural region are important activities to support food security, commodity markets, bioenergy industries, and formation of national policies. This study aims to develop forecasting models that have the capability to provide mid-season prediction of county-level corn yields for the entire Midwestern United States. We used multi-temporal MODIS NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) 16-day composite data as the primary input, with digital elevation model (DEM) and parameter-elevation relationships on independent slopes model (PRISM) climate data as additional inputs. The DEM and PRISM data, along with three types of cropland masks were tested and compared to evaluate their impacts on model predictive accuracy. Our results suggested that the use of general cropland masks (e.g., summer crop or cultivated crops) generated similar results compared with use of an annual corn-specific mask. Leave-one-year-out cross-validation resulted in an average R-2 of 0.75 and RMSE value of 1.10 t/ha. Using a DEM as an additional model input slightly improved performance, while inclusion of PRISM climate data appeared not to be important for our regional corn-yield model. Furthermore, our model has potential for real-time/early prediction. Our corn yield esitmates are available as early as late July, which is an improvement upon previous corn-yield prediction models. In addition to annual corn yield forecasting, we examined model uncertainties through spatial and temporal analysis of the model's predictive error distribution. The magnitude of predictive error (by county) appears to be associated with the spatial patterns of corn fields in the study area. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Giant and ultragiant aerosol particle variability over the eastern Great Lakes region	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Numerous studies have indicated the potential for giant and ultragiant aerosol particles to expedite the warm-rain process as a result of their extreme sizes. The central question regarding their importance is, Are they present in large enough numbers to influence the microphysics of the clouds significantly? Thus, quantification of these particles and their variability is paramount. New observations collected during the second Alliance Icing Research Study (AIRS II) are presented as evidence of the presence and variability of giant and ultragiant aerosol particles over a continental region-in this case, within the eastern Great Lakes region and parts of the midwestern United States and Canada during one month in winter 2003.

Species composition and the seasonal variation of TCB in water bodies depend on interactions between physical and chemical factors. The present investigation delineates temporal variations in physico-chemical water quality parameters, viz. nutrients and density, diversity, and distribution of toxic cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in Lake Ambazari (21A degrees 7'52aEuro(3)N, 79A degrees 2'22aEuro(3)E) and Lake Phutala (21A degrees 9'18aEuro(3)N, 79A degrees 2'37aEuro(3)E) at Nagpur (Maharashtra State), India. These lakes are important sources of recreational activities and fisheries. Toxic cyanobacterial diversity comprised Anabaena, Oscillatoria, Lyngbya, Phormidium, and Microcystis, a well-known toxic cyanobacterial genus, as dominant. Chlorophyll-a concentrations in the lakes ranged from 1.44 to 71.74 mg/m(3). A positive correlation of Microcystis biomass existed with orthophosphate-P (p < 0.05) and nitrate-N (p > 0.05). Identification and quantification of microcystin variants were carried out by high performance liquid chromatography equipped with photodiode array detector. Among all the tested toxin variants, microcystin-RR (arginine-arginine) was consistently recorded and exhibited a positive correlation (p < 0.05) with Microcystis in both the water bodies. Microcystis bloom formation was remarkable between post-monsoon and summer. Besides nutrient concentrations governing bloom formation, the allelopathic role of microcystins needs to be established.					; Gurao, Dr. Sarika/AAE-2164-2022	Gurao Maske, Sarika/0000-0003-0928-5789; 													0167-6369					OCT	2010	169	1-4					299	308		10.1007/s10661-009-1171-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-009-1171-7								19757108					WOS:000281597600027

Between February and April 2006 34 cases of H5N1 HPAIV-infected dead water fowl were identified in Switzerland, almost exclusively occurring in the Lake Constance area, a large overwintering area for migratory birds in the eastern part of the country. In total, 13 of these virus isolates were genetically characterized in the present study by full-length nucleotide sequence analysis of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase-coding region. All viruses could be confirmed as HPAIV based on the amino acid sequence of their hemagglutinin cleavage site. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all the virus isolates were highly similar to each other and to other H5N1 strains found in neighboring countries. All analyzed Swiss virus isolates belonged to the influenza virus subclade 2.2.1.																			0920-8569	1572-994X				DEC	2008	37	3					407	413		10.1007/s11262-008-0285-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-008-0285-2								18787938					WOS:000259770800015

Insights from varved clays in Lithuania	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Varved clays from a Late Pleistocene proglacial lake in the Pas & x2c7;amine sections (Lithuania) contain diverse organic matter of different origin, i.e. aquatic and allogenous macerals of the groups of liptinite, vitrinite and inertinite (their average contributions are 55%, 13.5% and 31.5%, respectively). The contents of TOC and TN vary from 0.51% to 1.01% and from 0.06% to 0.13%, respectively. Particulate organic matter could constitute the beginning of food chain for invertebrates represented by the trace fossils Cochlichnus anguineus, Glaciichnium liebegastensis, Gordia carickensis, Gordia isp., Helminthoidichnites isp., and Warvichnium ulbrichi. The accumulation of organic matter was higher during summers, as suggested by co-occurrence of TOC and quartz supplied to the lake mostly during ice melting. River inflow during humid seasons fed the lake and facilitated proliferation of algae, whereas, aeolian transportation of mineral (e.g., fine-grained quartz) and organic detritus (semifusinite) can be related to dry periods and the wildfires in vegetated areas. In spite of common thesis that Quaternary proglacial lakes were biological deserts, the Late Pleistocene proglacial lake is characterized by a food chain which starts at least from algae living in the lake and particulate organic matter transported from glaciated and non-glaciated, vegetated areas.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				MAY 15	2022	594								110928	10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.110928	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.110928		MAR 2022											WOS:000793177000006

Silicon load and the development of diatoms in three river-lake systems in countries surrounding the Baltic Sea	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We studied the formation of dissolved silicon loads from rivers to lakes, the development of diatoms in lakes and the role of climatic forcing on the silicon cycle in three river-lake systems in Sweden, Estonia and Northern Germany. We found coherent seasonality in the silicon loads of the two northern rivers, which was probably caused by the common snow-type hydrology of the catchments as distinct from the rain-type hydrology of the catchment, further south. The similarity among lakes in the dynamics of the Si-related variables studied resulted from similarities in mean lake depth and mixing type rather than the climatic regime. Among the variables measured at the three sites, river water discharge responded most coherently to climatic forcing as synchronized by the North Atlantic Oscillation winter index (NAOw). Water discharge and Si load were strongly linked variables and showed coherent patterns among the river systems. We found significant season-specific correlations of the NAOw with either the biomass or the share of diatoms in each lake, but no coherent pattern among the lakes. Our results indicate that processes driven by water discharge are more coherent across regions than in-lake processes.

Such analyses have often emphasized the importance of anthropogenic factors and, in particular, changing land use of management practices over timescales beyond the scope of direct process monitoring. This paper examines several U.K. sediment yield chronologies within the context of mesoscale atmospheric circulation patterns. Changes in the frequency of the winter cyclonic Lamb weather type since 1861 were found to account for a significant proportion of the variation in sediment yields. The results also have implications for future sediment accumulation rates given the potential geomorphological consequences of global climate change. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The occurrence of few species surrounding the spring cutlet was mainly attributed to a deficiency in macrophytes caused by strong currents. The part of the shoreline less affected by bathing activities exhibited a larger number of species; a proportion of the empty tests observed in suspension longer might have been introduced from peripheral peak layers. Species diversity was greatest in the region of the drainage ditches characterized by a dense community of macrophyte, though no explanation could be found for these populations being able to survive times of increased putrefaction at the end of the vegetation period.																			0003-9136						1982	95	OCT					93	105																WOS:A1982PV20900007

In this paper, exclusive 16S rDNA primers combined with quantitative PCR were used to research distribution patterns of overwintering Microcystis in sediment of Taihu Lake. Results showed that content of Microcystis cells in sediment was significant higher at N2 and W1 of the northwest region, which was the worst area of blooms disaster and maybe the principal overwintering shelter for Microcystis. Additionaly, it is necessary to repeat and summarize perennial rules, in order to provide theoretic references for reducing bloom-forming "seeds" by dredge during overwintering and recruitment periods.																					978-988-19116-7-4				2011							292	295																WOS:000393087400067
J	Yihdego, Y; Webb, J				Yihdego, Yohannes; Webb, John			Modelling of seasonal and long-term trends in lake salinity in southwestern Victoria, Australia	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												In southwestern Victoria a large number of lakes are scattered across the volcanic plains: many have problems with increasing salinity. To identify the hydrologic components behind this problem, three lakes, Burrumbeet, Linlithgow and Buninjon, were selected for detailed water and salt budget modelling using monthly values of rainfall, evaporation, surface inflow and outflow, and groundwater inflow and outflow (using the new modified difference method developed in this study). On average, rainfall begins to exceed evaporation with the onset of winter rainfall in May, so lake levels rise and lake salinities decline. The modelled lakes have become more saline over the last decade, a time of drought with below average rainfall, and all eventually dried out, their salinities rising to very high levels as they shallowed. Lake Burrumbeet is generally much less saline than Lakes Linlithgow and Buninjon, because it has substantial groundwater outflow, probably due to leakage through one or more volcanic necks. This limits the amount of time the lake water is subject to evaporation, and also allows significant salt export. The other lakes do not leak. The modelling indicates that when the lakes dry out, salt is lost from the lake-beds, probably due to wind deflation of salt crusts and leakage into the underlying groundwater. The removal of salt during drying-out phases resets the salinity of the lakes, limiting their ability to become more saline with time. Drying-out phases may therefore be essential in preventing the increased salinisation of lakes and wetland environments across the volcanic plains. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Hydrochemistry of Medium-Size Pristine Rivers in Boreal and Subarctic Zone: Disentangling Effect of Landscape Parameters across a Permafrost, Climate, and Vegetation Gradient	WATER												We studied two medium size pristine rivers (Taz and Ket) of boreal and subarctic zone, western Siberia, for a better understanding of the environmental factors controlling major and trace element transport in riverine systems. Our main objective was to test the impact of climate and land cover parameters (permafrost, vegetation, water coverage, soil organic carbon, and lithology) on carbon, major and trace element concentration in the main stem and tributaries of each river separately and when considering them together, across contrasting climate/permafrost zones. In the permafrost-bearing Taz River (main stem and 17 tributaries), sizable control of vegetation on element concentration was revealed. In particular, light coniferous and broadleaf mixed forest controlled DOC, and some nutrients (NO2, NO3, Mn, Fe, Mo, Cd, Ba), deciduous needle-leaf forest positively correlated with macronutrients (PO4, P-tot, Si, Mg, P, Ca) and Sr, and dark needle-leaf forest impacted N-tot, Al, and Rb. Organic C stock in the upper 30-100 cm soil positively correlated with Be, Mn, Co, Mo, Cd, Sb, and Bi. In the Ket River basin (large right tributary of the Ob River) and its 26 tributaries, we revealed a correlation between the phytomass stock at the watershed and alkaline-earth metals and U concentration in the river water. This control was weakly pronounced during high-water period (spring flood) and mostly occurred during summer low water period. Pairwise correlations between elements in both river systems demonstrated two group of solutes-(1) positively correlated with DIC (Si, alkalis (Li, Na), alkaline-earth metals (Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba), and U), this link originated from groundwater feeding of the river when the labile elements were leached from soluble minerals such as carbonates; and (2) elements positively correlated with DOC (trivalent, tetravalent, and other hydrolysates, Se and Cs). This group reflected mobilization from upper silicate mineral soil profile and plant litter, which was strongly facilitated by element colloidal status, notably for low-mobile geochemical tracers. The observed DOC vs DIC control on riverine transport of low-soluble and highly mobile elements, respectively, is also consistent with former observations in both river and lake waters of the WSL as well as in soil waters and permafrost ice. A principal component analysis demonstrated three main factors potentially controlling the major and TE concentrations. The first factor, responsible for 26% of overall variation, included aluminum and other low mobile trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates, Be, Cr, Nb, and elements strongly complexed with DOM such as Cu and Se. This factor presumably reflected the presence of organo-mineral colloids, and it was positively affected by the proportion of forest and organic C in soils of the watershed. The second factor (14% variation) likely represented a combined effect of productive litter in larch forest growing on carbonate-rich rocks and groundwater feeding of the rivers and acted on labile Na, Mg, Si, Ca, P, and Fe(II), but also DOC, micronutrients (Zn, Rb, Ba), and phytomass at the watershed. Via applying a substituting space for time approach for south-north gradient of studied river basins, we predict that climate warming in northern rivers may double or triple the concentration of DIC, Ca, Sr, U, but also increase the concentration of DOC, POC, and nutrients.					; Korets, Mikhail/P-9487-2015; Vorobyev, Sergey/M-8202-2016; Shirokova, Liudmila/HHZ-6302-2022; Lim, Artem/ABD-4563-2020; Krickov, Ivan/AAG-8605-2019; Pokrovsky, Oleg/W-4934-2019	Kritskov, Ivan/0000-0001-8818-0496; Korets, Mikhail/0000-0002-5015-5874; Lim, Artem/0000-0003-0165-4754; Pokrovsky, Oleg/0000-0002-3155-7069														2073-4441				JUL	2022	14	14							2250	10.3390/w14142250	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14142250													WOS:000831671200001

Tabanids were sampled using dry ice-baited Malaise traps, and by making overhead sweeps with a standard insect net while hiking a trail. Hybomitra spp. (299 individuals of 9 species) peaked in abundance in mid-May to early June in both years. Chrysops spp. (11,675 individuals of 14 species) and Tabanus spp. (324 individuals of 8 species) peaked in early-to late-July in both study years. Peak abundance for Chrysops and Tabanus spp. occurred earlier in 1991 than 1990, probably because the spring of 1991 was warmer. There were six new species records for Ingham County. More individual Hybomitra and Tabanus were taken by Malaise traps (77.3% for Hybomitra; 76.2% for Tabanus) than by netting (22.7% for Hybomitra; 23.8% for Tabanus). In contrast, sweep netting yielded more individual Chrysops (98.3%) than Malaise traps (1.7%). Tabanid attack rates on people hiking the trail exceeded 1,000 per hour on one occasion each year, at mid-season.																			0090-0222					SUM	1993	26	2					107	112																WOS:A1993MF53500003

Average freeze-up and ice breakup occurred on 9 November and 19 June, respectively. The freeze-up has been significantly delayed at a rate of 2.3 d per decade from 1964 onward (P < 0.05). No significant change has taken place in ice breakup. Annual average ice thickness has become smaller since the mid-1980s (P < 0.05). Air temperature during the early ice season significantly affected the ice thickness. The freeze-up date exhibits the highest correlation with the 2-month average daily minimum air temperature centered at the end of October, while the ice breakup date exhibits the highest correlation with the 2-month average daily maximal air temperature centered in mid May. A 1A degrees C increase in the surface air temperature corresponds to a freeze-up later by 3.4 days and an ice breakup earlier by 3.6 days. Snow cover is a critical factor in lake-ice climatology. For cumulative November to March precipitation of less than 0.13 m, the insulating effect of the snow dominated, while higher rates of precipitation favored thicker ice due to the formation of snow ice. Variations in ice records of Lake Kilpisjarvi can serve as an indicator of climate variations across the northern Europe. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) does not significantly affect the ice season there, although both the local air temperatures and winter precipitation contain a strong NAO signal.					; Cheng, Bin/D-4354-2013; Li, Zhijun/A-5299-2019; Lepparanta, Matti/M-7507-2017	Heil, Petra/0000-0003-2078-0342; Lepparanta, Matti/0000-0002-4754-5564													0165-0009	1573-1480				DEC	2012	115	3-4					725	739		10.1007/s10584-012-0489-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-012-0489-2													WOS:000310741600016

Sediment mobility and bed armoring in the St Clair River: insights from hydrodynamic modeling	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												The lake levels in Lake Michigan-Huron have recently fallen to near historical lows, as has the elevation difference between Lake Michigan-Huron compared to Lake Erie. This decline in lake levels has the potential to cause detrimental impacts on the lake ecosystems, together with social and economic impacts on communities in the entire Great Lakes region. Results from past work suggest that morphological changes in the St Clair River, which is the only natural outlet for Lake Michigan-Huron, could be an appreciable factor in the recent trends of lake level decline. A key research question is whether bed erosion within the river has caused an increase in water conveyance, therefore, contributed to the falling lake level. In this paper, a numerical modeling approach with field data is used to investigate the possibility of sediment movement in the St Clair River and assess the likelihood of morphological change under the current flow regime. A two-dimensional numerical model was used to study flow structure, bed shear stress, and sediment mobility/armoring over a range of flow discharges. Boundary conditions for the numerical model were provided by detailed field measurements that included high-resolution bathymetry and three-dimensional flow velocities. The results indicate that, without considering other effects, under the current range of flow conditions, the shear stresses produced by the river flow are too low to transport most of the coarse bed sediment within the reach and are too low to cause substantial bed erosion or bed scour. However, the detailed maps of the bed show mobile bedforms in the upper St Clair River that are indicative of sediment transport. Relatively high shear stresses near a constriction at the upstream end of the river and at channel bends could cause local scour and deposition. Ship-induced propeller wake erosion also is a likely cause of sediment movement in the entire reach. Other factors that may promote sediment movement, such as ice cover and dredging in the lower river, require further investigation. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Peeters, F; Hofmann, H				Peeters, Frank; Hofmann, Hilmar			Length-scale dependence of horizontal dispersion in the surface water of lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Horizontal dispersion in the surface waters of a medium-sized lake was investigated based on four experiments with ensembles of 14 to 17 drifters deployed in Lake Constance during the winter season. The experiments cover length scales between approximate to 30 and approximate to 3000 m which are typical for the grid length scales employed in 3-D models. Horizontal dispersion coefficients K-disp were estimated to range from approximate to 0.01 to approximate to 0.03 m(2) s(-1) at 100 m and from approximate to 0.1 to approximate to 0.7 m(2) s(-1) at 1000 m length scale L of the drifter distributions. In all experiments K-disp increased with L and in three of the four experiments this increase was about linear in L. However, although a linear increase of K-disp with L is consistent with dispersion by shear diffusion in flow fields with constant current shear, numerical modelling of the paths of the drifters, and the resulting spreading of the drifter ensembles indicates that horizontal shear diffusion is not sufficient to explain the increase of K-disp with L. The model results suggest that not shear diffusion due to large-scale shear across the entire drifter distribution, but scale-dependent turbulent diffusion is dominating the scale-dependence of K-disp at length scales between 100 and 1000 m. According to the model results, effects due to horizontal shear contribute less than 40% to the overall dispersion coefficient at length scales between 100 and 1000 m. However, horizontal shear is required to explain shape and orientation of the drifter distributions.

They ranged in salinity from 1 to 202 g l-1, their waters were dominated by sodium chloride, but with Ca2+/Mg2+ ratios of c. 1, and were generally alkaline. The fauna of 53 species included three halobionts (e.g. Parartemia minuta, Diacypris compacta), 18 halophilics (e.g. Mytilocypris splendida, Trigonocypris globulosa, Microcyclops dengizicus) and many salt-tolerant freshwater forms, mainly insects. Overall, the fauna were distinctly Australian, but some prominent taxa found in southern salt lakes were absent and others were replaced by local endemics and tropical species. Past climatic cycles have probably influenced the composition of the fauna.																			0067-1940						1987	38	6					877	884																WOS:A1987N343400013

Different seasonality of nitrate export from an agricultural watershed and an urbanized watershed in Midwestern USA	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Land use/land cover is a critical factor affecting temporal dynamics of nitrate export from watersheds. Based on a long-term (>30 years) water quality monitoring program in the Western Lake Erie area, United States, this study compared seasonal variation of nitrate export from an agricultural watershed and an urbanized watershed. A seasonality index was adapted to quantitatively characterize seasonal variation of nitrate export from the two watersheds. Results showed that monthly nitrate concentrations from the two watersheds exhibited different seasonal variation. Seasonality index of monthly nitrate loading for the agricultural watershed is approximately 3 times of that from the urbanized watershed and the difference is statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Meanwhile, calculated historical seasonality indexes of monthly nitrate loading for both watersheds exhibited significant (p < 0.05) decreasing trends according to the non-seasonal Mann-Kendall test. The identified differences in seasonal nitrate export from the two watersheds were mainly attributed to their distinct nitrogen sources, physical and biogeochemical settings. The declining seasonality index of monthly nitrate loading from the agricultural watershed could be partially caused by historical climate change in the study region, especially increased temperature during winter. Urbanization could be one key factor contributing to the declining seasonality index of monthly nitrate loading from the urbanized watershed. Information derived from this study have practical implications for developing proper management practices to mitigate nitrate pollution in Midwestern United States. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In the deep basins subjected to stratification chlorophyll a concentration correlated with air temperature with equal or shorter delay than it did in the shallow basins. Both precipitation and discharge were significant negatively correlated with chlorophyll a concentration in many of the basins with varying retention times. However, discharge into flushed basins had a more immediate influence on chlorophyll a concentration, and precipitation was earlier correlated with chlorophyll a concentration in basins fed from the smaller and closer situated catchment.

J	GREEN, J				GREEN, J			THE TEMPERATE-TROPICAL GRADIENT OF PLANKTONIC PROTOZOA AND ROTIFERA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Many flagellates, ciliates and rhizopods appear to be cosmopolitan, at least when considered at the morphospecies level. There are indications of tropical endemics among the ciliates and the rhizopods, but the percentage of endemics appears to be low. Among the rotifers there is a well marked latitudinal gradient, but the picture is complicated by the occurrence of warm water species during hot summers in temperate regions. A further complication has been introduced by the artificial development of heated water associated with power stations. The characteristic rotifer associations of the tropics are governed largely by temperature and salinity. A study of the altitudinal distribution of rotifers in Africa reveals an interplay between latitude and altitude in determining the similarities of the associations to those found in the temperate Old World.																			0018-8158					JAN 7	1994	272	1-3					13	26		10.1007/BF00006509	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006509													WOS:A1994MV62000003
J	Gardner, JE; Carey, S; Sigurdsson, H				Gardner, JE; Carey, S; Sigurdsson, H			Plinian eruptions at Glacier Peak and Newberry volcanoes, United States: Implications for volcanic hazards in the Cascade Range	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Several fall deposits from Glacier Peak and Newberry volcanoes, both located in the Cascade Range, United States, have been studied to determine eruptive column heights, intensities, and volumes. The late Pleistocene eruptions of Glacier Peak ranged from small phreatic explosions to two Plinian eruptions that each erupted more than 1 km(3) of magma at intensities > 10(8) kg/s, generating plumes with heights > 30 km. At Newberry volcano, the Last Plinian eruption (ca, 1300 C-14 yr B.P.) had an intensity of 2.8 x 10(7) kg/s and a plume height of 18 to 21 km. About 0.1 km(3) of magma was erupted in the Plinian phase, followed by eruption of a pyroclastic pow and an obsidian lava flow Combined with similar data from Mount St. Helens, Mount Rainier, and Mount Mazama (Crater Lake), these eruptions define the range of Plinian events that have occurred in the Cascade volcanic are in the past 12 k.y. During this period there have been Plinian eruptions with plume heights between 11 and 55 km, intensities between 10(6) and 10(9) kg/s, and volumes between 0.01 and > 5 km(3) of magma. All eruptions with intensities greater than or equal to 10(8) kg/s also produced large-volume pyroclastic flows and surges. Monitoring column height (intensity) during eruptions could help mitigate hazards because it may indicate pending generation of pyroclastic flows. In the Cascade Range, there have been at least 12 eruptions of > 1 km(3) of tephra in the past 12 k.y., suggesting that eruptions of such magnitude occur about once every 1 k.y., although such frequencies vary greatly at each volcano. The volume of magma erupted in each event correlates with both column height (intensity) and magma composition, suggesting that eruptions of these volcanoes relate to the accumulation rate of magma in their reservoirs.

On the basis of modelling, monitoring and experimental data, we demonstrate that community responses to global change are determined by food-chain length and that the top trophic level, and every second level below, will benefit from climate change, whereas the levels in between will suffer. Hence, phytoplankton, and thereby algal blooms, will benefit from climate change in three-, but not in two-trophic-level systems. Moreover, we show that both phytoplankton (resource) and zooplankton (consumer) advance their spring peak abundances similarly in response to a 3 degrees C temperature increase; that is, there is no support for a consumer/resource mismatch in a future climate scenario. However, in contrast to other taxa, cyanobacteria-known as toxin-producing nuisance phytoplankton(3)-benefit from a higher temperature and humic content irrespective of the food-chain composition. Our results are mirrored in natural ecosystems. By mechanistically merging present food-chain theory with large-scale environmental and climate changes, we provide a powerful framework for predicting and understanding future aquatic ecosystems and their provision of ecosystem services and water resources.

To investigate the urbanization effects on the thermal environment in the CCUA under complex terrain, we conducted simulations using the advanced Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF V4.1.5) model together with combined land use scenarios and terrain conditions. We observed that the WRF model reproduces the general synoptic summer weather pattern, particularly for the thermal environment. It was shown that the expansion of the urban area changed the underlying surface's thermal properties, leading to the urban heat island effect, enhanced further by the complex terrain. The simulation with the future scenario shows that the implementation of idealized measures including returning farmland to forests and expanding rivers and lakes can reduce the urban heat island effect and regulate the urban ecosystem. Therefore, urban planning policy has the potential to provide feasible suggestions to best manage the thermal environment of the future city toward improving the livelihood of the people in the environment.

During the summer of 2010, contaminant source tracking techniques, such as the conventional microbial and physical surveys and hydrodynamic models, were used to determine the reasons for poor water quality at Jeorse Park. Fecal indicator bacteria (E. coli, enterococci) were high throughout the season, with densities ranging from 12-2419 (culturable E. coli) and 1-2550 and <1-5831 (culturable and qPCR enterococci, respectively). Genetic markers for human (Bacteroides HF183) and gull (Catellicoccus marimammalium) fecal contamination were found in 15% and 37% of the samples indicating multiple sources contributing to poor water quality. Nesting colonies of double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) have steadily increased since 2005, coinciding with high E. coli levels. A hydrodynamic model indicated that limited circulation allows bacteria entering the embayed area to be retained in nearshore areas; and bacterial resuspension from sand and stranded beach wrack during storm events compounds the problem. The integration of hydrodynamics, expanded use of chemical and biological markers, as well as more complex statistical multivariate techniques can improve microbial source tracking, informing management actions to improve recreational water quality. Alterations to embayed structures to improve circulation and reduce nuisance algae as well as growing native plants to retain sand to improve beach morphometry are among some of the restoration strategies under consideration in ongoing multi-agency collaborations.

Nature-based tourism in the Nepalese Himalayas, however, is highly vulnerable to change in climatic conditions. This paper proposes a conceptual framework based on Jodha's mountain specificities, which include inaccessibility, fragility, marginality, diversity and niche, to examine the impacts and vulnerability of climate change on tourism in the Himalayas, with the cases of the three most popular protected areas of Nepal - Mt Everest National Park, Annapurna Conservation Area and Chitwan National Park - located in three physiographic zones. Each physiographic zone differs greatly and hence presents potentially different impacts and vulnerability to climate change. Avalanches and glacial lake outburst floods are the major hazards in high mountains; landslides, debris flows and flash floods are common in the hills; and floods are rampant in lowland Terai. The effects of these climate-related hazards on tourism are further exacerbated by mountain characteristics.					; Nyaupane, Gyan/ABH-7805-2020	Nyaupane, Gyan/0000-0002-0814-8507; 													1461-6688	1470-1340					2009	11	1					95	119	PII 908133220	10.1080/14616680802643359	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14616680802643359													WOS:000262641000006

The paper presents a very complicated process of ice formation on stagnant and flowing waters. Various kinds of ice are described together with their consequences for flow and thermal conditions. The possibility to define flow conditions in open channels with ice cover is described. In 1982, a significant flood on Wloclawek Reservoir ( Lower Vistula River) appeared, which was caused by the coincidence of unfavourable, extreme hydrological and meteorological conditions. These conditions, as well as the run and consequences of the flood, are described. Detailed field measurements of ice cover and flow were carried out. One- dimensional model for steady nonuniform flow was developed and applied to the conditions existing in 1982 on the Wloclawek Reservoir.																			1895-6572					MAR	2007	55	1					11	22		10.2478/s11600-006-0041-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11600-006-0041-8													WOS:000250520400003

Production of WTRs are liable to increase as clean drinking water becomes a standard resource. One of the largest disposal routes of these WTRs was via landfill, and the related disposal costs are a key driver behind the operational cost of the water treatment process. WTRs have many physical and chemical properties that lend them to potential positive reuse routes. Therefore, a large quantity of literature has been published on alternative reuse strategies. Existing or suggested alternative disposal routes for WTRs can be considered to fall within several categories: use as a pollutant and excess nutrient absorbent in soils and waters, bulk land application to agricultural soils, use in construction materials, and reuse through elemental recovery or as a wastewater coagulant. The main concerns and limitations restricting current and future beneficial uses of WTRs are discussed within. This includes those limitations linked to issues that have received much research attention such as perceived risks of undesirable phosphorous immobilisation and aluminium toxicity in soils, as well as areas that have received little coverage such as implications for terrestrial ecosystems following land application of WTRs.

In samples from four of the lakes plankton were exposed to a surfeit of phosphorus, for they were bathed in substantial concentrations (> 3 mg P m-3) of dissolved reactive phosphorus and their capacity to accumulate this nutrient was low (< 10% of initial phosphorus content in 4 h), indicating that their phosphorus stores were substantially full. In samples from all 10 lakes, plankton biomass increase (measured by change in chlorophyll a concentration) was prevented by shortage of nutrient nitrogen.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1986	20	2					199	208		10.1080/00288330.1986.9516144	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1986.9516144													WOS:A1986D925900005

An Analysis of Past and Future Changes in the Ice Cover of Two High-Arctic Lakes Based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Landsat Imagery	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Space-borne remotely sensed data can provide valuable insight into cryospheric processes in remote high-latitude regions For which direct observations are limited. In this study we use synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Landsat imagery to evaluate recent changes in the ice cover of Upper and Lower Murray Lakes (81 degrees 20' N, 69 degrees 30' W) on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada. These data highlight changes in ice conditions that have occurred over the past decade and provide a means for assessing the likely impacts of rising temperatures on future lake-ice conditions. Under current (1997-2007) climatic conditions the Murray Lakes average several weeks of ice-free conditions in August and early September, although in some years a partial ice cover persists throughout the year. The observed relationship between summer temperature and ice melt at Upper and Lower Murray Lakes suggests that recent warming in the High Arctic has forced the lakes near a threshold from a state characterized by perennial ice cover to the current state that includes seasonal melting of lake ice. Projected future warming will significantly increase the duration of ice free conditions on Upper and Lower Murray Lakes, with ice-out predicted to occur 13.5 +/- 4.0 and 17.6 +/- 5.6 days earlier, respectively, for every 1 degrees C increase in mean June July temperature.					; Bradley, Raymond/P-9358-2015	Cook, Timothy/0000-0002-4982-6415; 													1523-0430	1938-4246				FEB	2010	42	1					9	18		10.1657/1938-4246-42.1.9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1938-4246-42.1.9													WOS:000275560500002

In the mud layer the pressure of the gasses formed by methane and sulfur bacteria increased so much that an "air explosion" took place on Jan. 1952, in the deposits, air explosion so violent that 5-6 columns of bluish-black mud rose several meters into the air from the surface of the water. A water sample taken out Jan. 6 for quantitative determination proved to contain a total number of colonies of Microcystis (aeruginosa, flos-aquae, holsatica, firma, and Botrys) of 14,460 per ml.

Robust interpretation of stable isotope-based proxy reconstructions from the Suigetsu cores can be aided by a greater understanding of the factors affecting the isotope composition of the lake and how it relates to that of precipitation. Here we use extended contemporary monitoring to establish the factors affecting the stable isotope composition (delta 18O, delta 2H and d-excess) of precipitation, river water and lake water in the catchment surrounding Lake Suigetsu, central Japan. We show that the composition of precipitation is influenced by the dual East Asian Monsoon system, producing minima in delta 18O and delta 2H and semi-annually varying d-excess values across the year. These signals are then transferred to the lake system, where they are combined with secondary local influences on lake water composition: homogenisation with existing catchment waters, a catchment transit lag, the interaction with saline water from the nearby Sea of Japan, and evaporative enrichment during summer. Our observations suggest that the palaeo-isotope composition of Lake Suigetsu was closely related to the behaviour of the East Asian Monsoon. We highlight lake stratification and proxy seasonality as critical components of signal interpretation.

DOG concentrations were almost similar in those two lakes, but higher (169-330 mu M C. average 223 +/- 36 mu M C) in the epilimnion (0-8 m), and lower (151-303 mu M C, 193 +/- 25 mu M C) in the hypolimnion (10-25 m). Five fluorescence peaks (peaks M and A of fulvic acid-like: peak C of fulvic acid-like or autochthonous DOM-like: peaks T and T-UV of tryptophan-like components, respectively) were observed in the lake waters, indicating various sources of fluorescent dissolved organic matter in lakes. The fluorescence intensities of those peaks decreased (3-61%) in the epilimnion during the summer stratification period compared to hypolimnion. Chl a concentrations were 2.7-65.5 mu g I-I in the epilimnion and 1.4-41.0 mu g l(-1) in hypolimnion with the maximum level in July when water temperature (WT) was the highest of the year. DOG concentrations were significantly correlated with Chl a and WT. Chl a was well correlated with WT in the epilimnion of Lake Hongfeng, suggesting that biological activities might he a major DOG source in the lake waters. DOG concentrations were weakly correlated or not correlated with fulvic acid-like fluorescence in the epilimnion, but they were significantly correlated with tryptophan-like fluorescence, indicating that the tryptophan-like fluorescent material was from new DOM in the lakes during the summer period. But these correlations were often insignificant or absent in the waters of Lake Baihua except peaks T and T-UV, which may be caused by the input of organic contaminants from the industrial activities near Lake Baihua. This study may assist to better understand the sources of lake DOM and the effects of organic matter pollution on the biogeochemical cycling of DOM in lake environments.

To strengthen the spawning stock, about 2.6 million vendace were transferred from lake Suvasvesi into lake Hoytiainen in late winter 2000. The success of stock transfer was studied with the help of microsatellite genetic markers. Newly hatched larvae were collected in two years preceding and two years after the first reproduction of the transferred fish in lake Hoytiainen. Microsatellite DNA variation of larvae was assessed and the genotypes were compared with the genotypes of the two original populations and known hybrids of these two populations. An assignment test showed that a majority of the sampled larvae originated from the indigenous lake Hoytiainen population, and stock transfer had only minor effects on the population structure of lake Hoytiainen.

J	Kusch, J; Idelberger, S				Kusch, J; Idelberger, S			Spatial and temporal variability of bat foraging in a western European low mountain range forest	MAMMALIA												We monitored echolocation calls to measure the flight and foraging activity of European bats at twenty-four locations in the Palatinate Forest, Germany. Bats' flight activities correlated with their foraging activities at different sites. The distribution of bat foraging sites may be patchy even in a continuous forest habitat. Pipistrelle bats changed some of their foraging patches during the summer-season, most probably due to temporal differences of the resource densities at those patches. Daubenton's bats in contrast showed steadily high activities at two investigated forest lakes. The feeding buzz rate declined during five hours of nightly bat foraging. The nocturnal bat activity did not change significantly during this time, with the exception of few patches. Food resources as well as additional factors, like acoustical landmarks that enable orienting of echolocating bats, and habitat features that allow special foraging strategies should influence the quality of patches and their use by bats. The use of one, or of different foraging patches during the year, may depend on the seasonal constancy or variability of resources, on the degree of isolation of a patch type, and on the species specific foraging strategy.																			0025-1461						2005	69	1					21	33		10.1515/mamm.2005.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/mamm.2005.003													WOS:000228594200003

This study improved the predictive simulation of instream Chl a with the Hydrological Simulation Program-FORTRAN (HSPF) by adding automatic calibration and modifying the growth-temperature formulation of phytoplankton in the original HSPF model. A total of 62 model parameters, selected from a series of sensitivity analyses, were automatically calibrated in a stepwise manner for different variables in the order of flow, sediment, water temperature, ammonia/nitrate couple, and phosphate/Chl a couple. With finer temporal resolution (5-8 days) data than those of majority of the existing HSPF studies, the automatic calibration procedure provided the model with performance ratings of 'satisfactory' or better for all the variables including nutrients and Chl a: The percent bias values ranged from -18% - 54% and -20% - 62% for nutrients and Chl a, respectively. The original linear equation on the growth-temperature relationship of phytoplankton in simulating instream Chl a was modified using a quadratic equation and an exponential equation. The exponential equation outperformed the original linear and quadratic equations, particularly in simulating the excess concentrations of Chl a observed during summer seasons. For the validation data set, the exponential equation predicted 78% of the eutrophic cases while the linear and quadratic equation only predicted 53% and 13% of the eutrophic cases, respectively. The modified HSPF model offers an improved prediction of instream Chl a. This approach will be useful for providing early warning of algal blooms, facilitating the implementation of effective management of stream water quality.

This may be the case for fish ponds located in farmland landscapes. To address this issue, the present study investigated the contamination by pesticides of fish ponds located in the mixed agriculture-pond landscape of the Dombes area, France. Ten ponds were selected in water catchments with a gradient of 3-57 ha of cropland with maize and winter cereals as the dominant crops. A total of 197 water samples were collected in the ponds during the fish production season over 3 years. Recently used pesticides were the most frequent residues occurring. Occurrences greater than 0.1 mu gL(-1) particularly concerned chlorotoluron and S-metolachlor. Maximum observed concentrations were slightly above 3 mu gL(-1) for S-metolachlor, acetochlor, and dimethenamide, all herbicides allowed for maize cultivation. Isoproturon and chlorotoluron, herbicides allowed in cereal crops, reached up to 1.2 and 1.0 mu gL(-1), respectively. We found a significant positive effect of crop area in catchments on the pond contamination frequency by pesticides and more significantly on the contamination frequency by broad-spectrum herbicides (glyphosate and AMPA residues). The cumulative antecedent rainfall was best correlated to the frequency of highest contaminations (> 0.5 mu gL(-1)). In such a hydrological context, the crop area within catchment was identified as a good indicator of fish pond exposure to pesticide residues. Finally, we proposed to adapt some mitigation measures to reduce fish pond contamination.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2022	29	44					66858	66873		10.1007/s11356-022-20492-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-20492-8		MAY 2022						35513618					WOS:000791111400016

The Nyingchi event was a thrusting event, with a focal depth of 12km at 29.87 degrees N and 95.02 degrees E. According to emergency investigations and remote sensing, the Nyingchi event triggered at least 1820 co-seismic landslides. The landslides mainly occurred in the Grand Canyon region within an area of 527km(2) (the inner area of Namcha Barwa tectonic node). The landslide distribution characterises an obvious hanging wall effect and is classified as small concentration region and large landslide distribution area. The failure patterns mainly consist of rock falls, rock avalanches, and deposit failures. One co-seismic landslide partially blocked the Yarlung Zangbo River, and the barrier lake remained. Different influencing factors, such as the seismic fault, river, slope aspect, slope angle, rocks, and elevation, have different influences on landslide occurrences, and the co-seismic landslides in the hanging wall area and footwall area present obviously different characteristics. Additionally, the post-earthquake effect impacted the recent Sedongpu landslide.

In order to determine quantitatively the flux and chemical contributions of dust to Lake Qinghai sediment, dust samples were collected monthly at two sites surrounding the lake from June 2009 to May 2011. The results demonstrate similar chemical compositions of dust samples to the local loess, implying strong representativeness of regional dust. The average dust deposition flux is 265.7 +/- 55.0 g/m(2)/a, constituting 56.6 +/- 11.7% of the modern sediment, approximating to previous estimates (similar to 65%). Contributions of dust-derived elements in the sediment differ substantially, with a minimum of 16.7% for Sr and a maximum of 83.9% for Cu. Among these elements, the contribution of lithophile elements (Na, Al, K, Ti, Mn, Fe and Rb) is close to that of the bulk dust; the contributions of mobile elements (Mg, Ca and Sr) are low, only 16.7% (Sr)-26.1% (Mg), whereas potentially harmful metals (Cu, Zn and Pb) have high contributions (70.3-83.9%). Seasonal variations of elemental inputs indicate that springtime contributions dominate the annual dust fluxes for all elements into the sediment, in agreement with the high dust flux in spring. These observations not only quantify the contribution of dust to the sediment of Lake Qinghai, but also highlight the important role of dust in the accumulation of various elements in the sediment, especially for potentially harmful metals.

This work investigated the I-129 and I-127 distribution in water samples collected from the terrestrial (rivers, lakes and springs) and marine water systems (estuary and sea) in China. The measured I-129 concentrations of (1-51) x 10(6) atoms/L and I-129/I-127 ratios of (0.03-21) x 10(-10) shows the variability of I-129 level in the water systems. The local permafrost and seasonal frozen environment play a key role in groundwater recharge in the Qinghai-Tibet region, which is reflected in the I-129 distribution in surface water. The depth distribution of I-129 in the water column of the South China Sea reflects the effluence of different currents. The results also indicate that the hydrosphere of China contains one to three orders of magnitude less I-129 compared to those reported in Europe. Despite the large distance, the European nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities represent the major source of I-129 in the hydrosphere of China through atmospheric transport. The contribution of the Fukushima nuclear accident to I-129 levels in the hydrosphere of China was negligible.					; Hou, Xiaolin/A-1585-2008	Chen, Xuegao/0000-0001-8396-1605; Hou, Xiaolin/0000-0002-4851-4858; , Zhongbo/0000-0002-8578-9228													0265-931X	1879-1700				DEC	2018	192						86	94		10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.06.005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.06.005								29909225					WOS:000446289100010

Altogether 69 AMS C-14 measurements were performed on these deposits, mostly on terrestrial plant macrofossils. In several cases, plant macrofossils, aquatic animal remains (Cladoceran eggs) and bulk sediment were measured from the same depth allowing for the comparison of various sediment components in terms of their dating potential. Age-depth models were developed using both Bayesian modelling with the BACON and smooth spline curve fitting with the CLAM software. In this study Bayesian models are applied to identify outlier C-14 dates, while smooth spline models are used to model sediment accumulation age-depth relations, as these are more likely to follow natural deposition time changes of lake sediments. Changes in sediment deposition times (DT) in relation to catchment size and climate are also studied. DT varied considerably in the late glacial (LG) part of the records. The sediment sequence characterised by high deposition rates during the late glacial (DT maximum around 100-110 years cm(-1)) was defined by small catchment size (Lake Brazi, 6 ha; surface area: 0.5 ha). In contrast, much slower LG sediment deposition in the southern slope lake characterised by large catchment area (Lake Lia, 171 ha, 20 years cm(-1)), principally reflecting strong erosion in these catchment areas at times when vegetation cover was scarce. Holocene was characterised again by variable DT values, but only Lake Gales showed extreme values: 62-110 years between 10,900 and 6050 cal yr BP, followed by much slower sediment deposition in the last 6000 years (av. 29 years cm(-1)). Generally, sediment deposition times were largely dependent on the stability and vegetation cover of the slope in the case of high altitude deep lakes, while lower altitude, shallow lakes showed slower sediment deposition time in the early and mid-Holocene, when summer insolation was higher than today. This reflects that in these shallow lakes in-lake organic production probably increased with summer insolation, which was a significant driver in the rate of deposition.

A relationship between O-18 and H-2 in local precipitation was used to estimate the local meteoric water line. The dataset obtained for the water enabled to identify the modification of the water's isotopic composition due to evaporation, connected with seasonal lake water stratification and mixing patterns. Statistically significant correlation coefficients suggest that the O-18 of the carbonate fraction in the sediment traps depends on the O-18 of rainfall water and on air temperature. The fractionation coefficient shows that in summer months the carbonate precipitation process is closest to equilibrium. As expected for an exorheic lake, no significant correlation was observed between O-18 and C-13 in precipitated carbonate.

Boron isotope variations and its geochemical application in nature	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The high geochemical reactivity of boron and the large relative mass difference between B-10 and B-11 lead to significant boron isotope fractionation in nature. So far the measured range of boron isotope composition (B-11) varies between -70 and +75 parts per thousand. The negative B-11 values are found in non-marine evaporite borate minerals and tourmalines, whereas positive B-11 values are common in salt lake brines and evaporated seawater. Since the 1980s, with improved measurement methods, applications of boron isotope analysis have increased rapidly. At present, boron isotopes are successfully applied to reconstruct ancient marine environments, to determine depositional environments and ore genesis, to trace groundwater pollution and seawater intrusion, and to study continental erosion. This paper summarises the methods for boron isotope analysis, the mechanisms of boron isotope fractionation and the distribution of boron isotopes in nature, reviews the achievements and the problems of boron isotopes in geochemical applications, and proposes research directions of boron isotopes in geochemical fields.

The experimental data were collected during long-term expeditionary studies on the southeastern coast of the lake, at the Boyarsky station (51.84 degrees N, 106.06 degrees E), with the use of a LOSA-M2 lidar designed at the Institute of Atmospheric Optics, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences (IAO SB RAS). A complex, layered, vertical structure of the atmospheric aerosol in the mountain basin is revealed. This is caused by peculiarities of the temperature and wind regimes at this site. The general pattern of the calculated autocorrelation matrices shows a good correlation in the range of 0-1000 m (the correlation coefficient is greater than 0.5). The aerosol layers in the lower-kilometer layer are closely related to each other and have a common origin.

In this study, a regional climate model-based evaporation tagging algorithm is extended with an age tracer approach to calculate moisture residence times, defined as time between the original evaporation and the returning of water masses to the land surface as precipitation. Our case study addresses how long this time is for the transpired and for the direct evaporated moisture. Our study region is the Poyang Lake region in Southeast China, the largest freshwater lake in the country. We perform simulations covering the period from October 2004 to December 2005. In 2005, 11% of direct evaporated water (10% of transpired water) precipitates locally. Direct evaporated water accounts for 64% and transpired water for 36% of the total tagged moisture with a mean age of around 36 h for both. Considering precipitation, a large proportion (69%) originates from direct evaporated water with a mean atmospheric residence time of 6.6 h and a smaller amount from transpired water with a longer residence time of 10.7 h. Modulated by the East Asian monsoon, the variation of the meteorological conditions, the magnitude of the partitioned moisture, and the corresponding residence time patterns change seasonally and spatially and reveal the different fate of transpired and direct evaporated water in the atmospheric hydrological cycle. We conclude that our methodological approach has the potential to be used for addressing how timescales of the hydrological cycle changes regionally under global warming.

Our archeological and paleolimnological data show that this was not always the case. Thule Inuit whalers, whose winter settlements consisted of houses constructed from the bones of bowhead whales on Somerset Island between about anno Domini 1200 and 1600, markedly changed pond water quality and ecology. The arrival of whalers 8 centuries ago caused marked changes in water chemistry and the expansion of moss substrates. Although whalers abandoned the area >4 centuries ago, the legacy of these human disturbances is still evident in the pond's present-day limnology and is characterized by elevated nutrient concentrations and atypical biota. This is the earliest reported paleolimnological record of changes in aquatic ecology associated with local human activities in Canada or the United States, or for any circumpolar ecosystem.

Using machine learning models to estimate Escherichia coli concentration in an irrigation pond from water quality and drone-based RGB imagery data	WATER RESEARCH												The rapid and efficient quantification of Escherichia coli concentrations is crucial for monitoring water quality. Remote sensing techniques and machine learning algorithms have been used to detect E. coli in water and estimate its concentrations. The application of these approaches, however, is challenged by limited sample availability and unbalanced water quality datasets. In this study, we estimated the E. coli concentration in an irrigation pond in Maryland, USA, during the summer season using demosaiced natural color (red, green, and blue: RGB) imagery in the visible and infrared spectral ranges, and a set of 14 water quality parameters. We did this by deploying four machine learning models - Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and K-nearest Neighbor (KNN) - under three data utilization scenarios: water quality parameters only, combined water quality and small unmanned aircraft system (sUAS)-based RGB data, and RGB data only. To select the training and test datasets, we applied two data-splitting methods: ordinary and quantile data splitting. These methods provided a constant splitting ratio in each decile of the E. coli concentration distribution. Quantile data splitting resulted in better model performance metrics and smaller differences between the metrics for both the training and testing datasets. When trained with quantile data splitting after hyperparameter optimization, models RF, GBM, and XGB had R-2 values above 0.847 for the training dataset and above 0.689 for the test dataset. The combination of water quality and RGB imagery data resulted in a higher R-2 value (>0.896) for the test dataset. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) of the relative importance of variables revealed that the visible blue spectrum intensity and water temperature were the most influential parameters in the RF model. Demosaiced RGB imagery served as a useful predictor of E. coli concentration in the studied irrigation pond					Hong, Seokmin/OKS-7430-2025; Kim, Myungshin/AAP-9262-2020; Pachepsky, Yakov/H-7236-2019; Morgan, Billie/GXG-7269-2022; Stocker, Matthew/KIG-0922-2024	Pachepsky, Yakov/0000-0003-0232-6090; 													0043-1354	1879-2448				AUG 15	2024	260								121861	10.1016/j.watres.2024.121861	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2024.121861		JUN 2024						38875854					WOS:001259026100001

Functional Wetland Loss Drives Emerging Risks to Waterbird Migration Networks	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Migratory waterbirds (i.e., shorebirds, wading birds, and waterfowl) rely on a diffuse continental network of wetland habitats to support annual life cycle needs. Emerging threats of climate and land-use change raise new concerns over the sustainability of these habitat networks as water scarcity triggers cascading ecological effects impacting wetland habitat availability. Here we use important waterbird regions in Oregon and California, United States, as a model system to examine patterns of landscape change impacting wetland habitat networks in western North America. Wetland hydrology and flooded agricultural habitats were monitored monthly from 1988 to 2020 using satellite imagery to quantify the timing and duration of inundation-a key delimiter of habitat niche values associated with waterbird use. Trends were binned by management practice and wetland hydroperiods (semi-permanent, seasonal, and temporary) to identify differences in their climate and land-use change sensitivity. Wetland results were assessed using 33 waterbird species to detect non-linear effects of network change across a diversity of life cycle and habitat needs. Pervasive loss of semi-permanent wetlands was an indicator of systemic functional decline. Shortened hydroperiods caused by excessive drying transitioned semi-permanent wetlands to seasonal and temporary hydrologies-a process that in part counterbalanced concurrent seasonal and temporary wetland losses. Expansion of seasonal and temporary wetlands associated with closed-basin lakes offset wetland declines on other public and private lands, including wildlife refuges. Diving ducks, black terns, and grebes exhibited the most significant risk of habitat decline due to semi-permanent wetland loss that overlapped important migration, breeding, molting, and wintering periods. Shorebirds and dabbling ducks were beneficiaries of stable agricultural practices and top-down processes of functional wetland declines that operated collectively to maintain habitat needs. Outcomes from this work provide a novel perspective of wetland ecosystem change affecting waterbirds and their migration networks. Understanding the complexity of these relationships will become increasingly important as water scarcity continues to restructure the timing and availability of wetland resources.						casazza, Mike/0000-0002-5636-735X													2296-701X					MAR 10	2022	10								844278	10.3389/fevo.2022.844278	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2022.844278													WOS:000776745900001

We examined whether the position of DCM changes as a consequence of long-time (global warming: glacial clay input) and short-time (eruption: volcanic ashes) events. We performed different field studies: (1) an interlacustrine analysis of six lakes from different basins, including data of the 2011 volcanic eruption, which caused an unexpected variation in water transparency; and (2) an intralacustrine analysis in which we compared different stations along a transparency gradient in Lake Mascardi caused by glacial clay input at one end of the gradient. In these analyses, we documented changes in DCM depth and its relationship with different parameters. DCM development was not related with thermocline depth or nutrient distribution. In all cases, the only significant variables were Kd 320 nm and Kd PAR. Our study showed that suspended particles (glacial clay and volcanic ashes) can play a crucial role in transparent lakes, affecting lake features such as the phototrophic biomass distribution along the water column. Suspended solid inputs from either glacial clay or volcanic ashes produce a comparable effect, provoking a decrease in light and, consequently, an upper location of the DCM. Thus, the DCM position is highly sensitive to global changes, such as increased temperatures causing glacier recession or to regional changes caused by volcanic eruptions.					; Balseiro, Esteban/Y-2743-2019; CUASSOLO, FLORENCIA/HMW-1590-2023	Bastidas Navarro, Marcela/0000-0002-6558-0451; Laspoumaderes, Cecilia/0000-0001-7790-2975; Balseiro, Esteban/0000-0002-5052-0587; Modenutti, Beatriz/0000-0002-8683-5679													1015-1621	1420-9055				JUL	2013	75	3					361	371		10.1007/s00027-012-0282-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-012-0282-3													WOS:000323901900003

Glacier retreat marks in the formation and expansion, and sometimes outburst of moraine-dammed lakes. Lato Lake is one of the high-altitude and unexplored glacial lakes upstream of Gya-Miru village in the Leh-Ladakh region. This study is the first of its kind to assess hydrogeochemistry (HCO3-, SO42-, NO3-, Cl-, F-, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and K+) and studying the dynamics of a moraine-dammed lake in the Ladakh Himalayas. We observed substantial expansion of Lato Lake over the past 50 years between 1969 and 2019, and the areas of the lake have increased while the glacier area is reduced by 16.4% and 4.15%, respectively. The pH values ranging from 7.6 to 8.1 show slightly alkaline. HCO3-, Ca2+, and SO42- were the most dominant ions during the study period 2018-19. The high (Ca2+ + Mg2+) and a low (Na+ + K+) ratio to the total cations show that Lato Lake receives ions from rock weathering, primarily from carbonate rocks. Gibbs and Na-Mixing plot also support the hydrogeochemistry of lake water was primarily controlled by rock weathering. HYSPILT backward trajectory model suggested that atmospheric input mainly originated from the seawater vapor transported by the summer monsoonal and westerly circulation systems. Results show that the lake has a substantial impact on the long-range transport of ocean water relative to local interferences.					; Soheb, Mohd/HNB-6516-2023; Shamurailatpam, Monica/KIK-2310-2024; BISWAL, KALYAN/NRB-2889-2025; Mandal, Arindan/AHB-6408-2022	BISWAL, KALYAN/0000-0003-2896-7363; , Chetan Singh/0009-0003-4881-4388; AL, Ramanathan/0000-0002-3491-2273; Soheb, Mohd/0000-0001-7788-8894; Shamurailatpam, Monica Sharma/0000-0003-1814-5702; , Himanshu Kaushik/0009-0005-7320-7162													1895-6572	1895-7455				DEC	2021	69	6					2377	2391		10.1007/s11600-021-00670-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11600-021-00670-x		SEP 2021											WOS:000695769300001

It is surrounded by various industries and oil refineries, which contaminate the lake by oil spills and leakage. Moreover, the lake receives freshwater from underwater springs, plus drainage from industrialized catchment and Athens landfill. Potential contamination of the lakes' sediments in heavy metals and metalloids was assessed by means of enrichment factors (EFs) estimated against local preindustrial core sediment; elements were normalized to loss on ignition. EFs revealed that surface sediments were enriched in Pb (x10.2), Cu (x6.7), V (x5.1), Ni (x4.1), and other heavy metals. The use of EFs is recommended as a reliable method for heavy metal contamination assessment, provided that (1) element contents are corrected following a careful normalization procedure, (2) local preindustrial sediment is used as reference, and (3) reference sediment should be unaffected by diagenetic alterations.					; Katsanevakis, Stelios/AGR-7012-2022; Karageorgis, Aristomenis/B-1427-2013; Kaberi, Helen/C-4668-2012	Kaberi, Helen/0000-0002-4399-4055; Katsanevakis, Stelios/0000-0002-5137-7540; 													0049-6979	1573-2932				NOV	2009	204	1-4					243	258		10.1007/s11270-009-0041-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-009-0041-9													WOS:000271504900021

Significant increases (+20 dB) in echo intensity and current velocities correlate well with satellite imagery of a sediment-laden plume transporting material in a cyclonic Bow around the lake basinis perimeter. A decrease in echo intensity to near-background levels following resuspension events suggests that the larger particles settle out, leaving the very fine material that remains visible in satellite imagery for many days. Although there were no concurrent Total Suspended Material measurements during the event, the ADCP results suggest that resuspension events and plume movements can be detected.																					0-7803-5505-9				1999							264	268		10.1109/CCM.1999.755252	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CCM.1999.755252													WOS:000079487900052

In general the snakes remained in their home ranges (which usually did not include the snakes'' hibernating sites) until lake September or early October and then moved directly to the communal hibernacula and went below ground. Emergence occurred in late April and early May and most snakes returned to their home ranges without delay. The home ranges of males averaged over three times the size of those of females. Males also moved more often and farther than females. Accurate assessment of these patterns would not have been possible without radiotelemetry. Males were captured more frequently than females during the mating season, although they were most active later in the summer. The peak in captures may be due to males spending more time in open areas (where they were most often captured) during the breeding season because doing so somehow increases their success in locating females. Activity and movement patterns follow quite different patterns in males and females. Male activity may be determined by thermoregulatory factors while females may be affected more by reproduction.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				FEB	1989	67	2					463	468		10.1139/z89-067	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z89-067													WOS:A1989T799400033

They cause serious deterioration in the ecological environment and pollute drinking water sources. In the present study, a source water reservoirZhoucun Reservoir in East Chinawas selected as the study site. Through a combination of field monitoring and in situ release experiments of sulfides, the characteristics of seasonal variation and distribution of sulfides and VOSc in the reservoir were studied, and the cause of the sulfide pollution was explained. The results show that sulfide pollution was quite severe in August and September 2014 in the Zhoucun Reservoir, with up to 1.59 mgL(-1) of sulfides in the lower layer water. The main source of sulfides is endogenous pollution. VOSc concentration correlates very well with that of sulfides during the summer, with a peak VOSc concentration of 44.37 gL(-1). An installed water-lifting aeration system was shown to directly oxygenate the lower layer water, as well as mix water from the lower and the upper layers. Finally, the principle and results of controlling sulfides and VOSc in reservoirs using water-lifting aerators are clarified. Information about sulfides and VOSc fluctuation and control gained in this study may be applicable to similar reservoirs, and useful in practical water quality improvement and pollution prevention.

Densities increased rapidly in May immediately after the disappearance of ice, showed only small fluctuations during the summer, and waned during Oct. Microscopic algae, mainly Fragilaria capucina, Gomphonema olivaceum, G. ventricosa, Cymbella ventricosa and other diatoms, reached peak abundance (2 .times. 109 .mu.m3/cm2) on irregular occasions (July, Sept., Oct.) throughout the growing season. Filamentous algae, mainly Ulothrix zonata, reached maximum densities (60 mg/cm2 dry wt) during July of both years. Additional survey collections of epilithic algae were made at 14 sites in the east arm of the lake during June and July 1975. The most common species included Tabellaria flocculosa, Rhopalodia gibba, Cymbella angustata, C. microecephala, Anomoeoneis vitrea, Achnanthes minutissima and U. zonata.

The high P values were in some cases related to farm effluent pollution but in many others, despite annual mean values up to 1.46 mg liter-1, appear natural and due to the local mineralogy. For the entire group, there were no significant relationships between mean growth season chlorophyll a concentration and any measured chemical, morphometric, or zooplankton variable. When the group was divided on the basis of maximum depth and presence or absence of thermal stratification in summer into a shallow group (< 3 m) and a deep group (> 3 m), strong inverse correlation was obtained between chlorophyll a and cladoceran abundance in the shallow group and strong direct correlation with inorganic N in the deep group. Grazer control in the shallow group is probably linked with the dominance of submerged macrophytes and the refuges they provide for grazers. Some of the controversy presently surrounding the relative importance of top-down vs. bottom-up control of phytoplankton populations may thus be removed if consideration is given to the morphometry of the lakes.

The ponds were stocked with bream (Abramis brama L.), white bream (Blicca bjoerkna L.), roach (Rutilus rutilus L.) and wild carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) of 3+-5+ age classes at standing crop biomass varying from 0 to 500 kg ha(-1). Cyprinids caused an increase in sediment resuspension and in turbidity, in proportion to their biomass. Mean crustacean biomass did not significantly affect phytoplankton biomass due to intense grazing by fish during spring. Ponds with high fish stocks showed reduced midge biomass and vegetation cover and increased biomass of predatory invertebrates.																			0018-8158					FEB 28	1997	345		2-3				117	129		10.1023/A:1002919305978	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1002919305978													WOS:A1997XK53800003
J	Krienitz, L; Kasprzak, P; Koschel, R				Krienitz, L; Kasprzak, P; Koschel, R			Long term study on the influence of eutrophication, restoration and biomanipulation on the structure and development of phytoplankton communities in Feldberger Haussee (Baltic Lake District, Germany)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Feldberger Haussee provides a classic example of eutrophication history of hardwater lakes in the Baltic Lake District (Germany) and of changes in their algal flora during the 20th century. The lake originally was regarded as slightly eutrophic. A process of drastic eutrophication from the 1950s until the end of the 1970s caused mass developments of blue-green and green algae. A restoration program was started in the 1980s to improve the water quality of the lake using both diversion of sewage outside the catchment area, and biomanipulation by altering the fish community. This restoration program led to positive changes in the lake ecosystem. Direct effects of biomanipulation resulted in an increase of herbivorous zooplankton, a decrease of phytoplankton biomass, and an increase of water transparency. The recovery of Feldberger Haussee also may have been indirectly enhanced by an increase in nutrient sedimentation as a consequence of intensified calcite precipitation, decrease in phosphorus remobilization due to a pH-decrease, increased N/P-ratio, and recolonization of the littoral zone by macrophytes. This paper concentrates on the long term development of the phytoplankton community as a response to changes in the food web structure as well as to alterations in the chemical environment of the algae. Both are reflected in four major stages passed by the algal assemblage between 1980 and 1994: (1) From 1980-summer 1985 dense green algal populations were found indicating similar conditions as in the 1970s during the period of maximum eutrophication. (2) A diverse phytoplankton community during summer 1985-1989 showed the first effects of a recovery. (3) From 1990-1992 the phytoplankton was characterized by ungrazeable filamentous blue-green algae first of all as a response to increased herbivory of zooplankton on edible species and to increasing N/P-ratios. (4) Finally, the algal species diversity increased in 1993 and 1994 whereas the phytoplankton biomass decreased showing the success of the combined restoration measures.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP 9	1996	330	2					89	110		10.1007/BF00019998	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00019998													WOS:A1996VM48300002
J	Schoch, RR				Schoch, Rainer R.			The life cycle in late Paleozoic eryopid temnospondyls: developmental variation, plasticity and phylogeny	FOSSIL RECORD												Eryopid temnospondyls were large apex predators in Carboniferous and Permian stream and lake habitats. The eryopid life cycle is exemplified by Onchiodon labyrinthicus from Niederhaslich (Saxony, Germany), which is represented by numerous size classes from small larvae to heavily ossified adults. Morphometric and principal component analyses provide new insights into ontogenetic changes in O. labyrinthicus, and comparison with adults of other eryopids documents phylogenetic patterns in the occupation of morphospace. Compared with small specimens of Sclerocephalus spp., immature O. labyrinthicus occupies a neighboring but much larger space, corresponding to a broader range of variation. Adults of Actinodon frossardi map with some juveniles of O. labyrinthicus, whereas other juveniles of the latter lie close to adults of O. thuringiensis, Glaukerpeton avinoffi and Osteophorus roemeri. Morphospace occupation of adult eryopids is partly consistent with cladistic tree topology, which gives the following branching pattern: Actinodon frossardi forms the basalmost eryopid, followed by Osteophorus roemeri, Glaukerpeton avinoffi and the genus Onchiodon (O. labyrinthicus + O. thuringiensis); then Clamorosaurus nocturnus; and finally the monophyletic genus Eryops. The presumably juvenile skull of Eryops anatinus falls well outside the domains of both adult eryopids and immature O. labyrinthicus, showing a unique combination of juvenile and adult features. Instead, Onchiodon langenhani and the Ruprechtice specimens referred to O. labyrinthicus map within the domain of immature O. labyrinthicus. Raised levels of variation in O. labyrinthicus coincide with evidence of a stressed habitat, in which limiting factors were fluctuating salinity, absence of fishes, enhanced competition and seasonal algal blooms. The documented broad variation was possibly caused by developmental plasticity responding to fluctuations in lake hydrology and nutrients in this small, short-lived water body.																			2193-0066	1860-1014				SEP 30	2021	24	2					295	319		10.5194/fr-24-295-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/fr-24-295-2021													WOS:000710514000001

An assessment of lentic ceratopogonids, ephemeropterans, trichopterans and oribatid mites as indicators of past environmental change in Finland	ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI												I studied a dataset of surface sediment samples from 80 lakes with zoological macroremain analysis to assess the potential of fossil ceratopogonids (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae), ephemeropterans (Insecta: Ephemeroptera), trichopterans (Insecta: Trichoptera) and oribatid mites (Acarina: Oribatida) as palaeolimnological indicators in Finland. Results showed that late-winter hypolimnetic oxygen and climatic variables were most important in influencing the occurrence and abundance of these taxa. Of the ceratopogonids, the Bezzia type was an indicator of elevated hypolimnetic oxygen conditions, warm climate and oligotrophy, while the Dasyhelea type indicated low hypolimnetic oxygen conditions, moderately cool climate and mild acidity. Ephemeropterans, trichopterans and oribatids indicated warm climatic conditions and oribatids were also indicative of elevated oxygen conditions and small oligotrophic lakes. Results of this study can be useful in palaeolimnological studies because the fauna examined provides a valuable supplementary data source for multiproxy studies.

Nearshore-offshore exchanges by enhanced turbulent mixing along the north shore of Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Seasonal nearshore-offshore exchanges by coastal upwelling events in large lakes can play a significant role in nearshore nutrient dynamics, affecting lake productivity and water quality. We analyzed field observations along the north shore of Lake Ontario, collected in the summer of 2018, focusing on the lit-toral zone and specifically the Cladophora habitat zone (<15 m), to investigate episodic enhanced vertical mixing by coastal up/downwelling events. Vertical turbulent diffusivity (Kz) based on the buoyancy Reynolds number above the metalimnion layer during downwelling events was generally higher than those below the metalimnion layer during upwelling events; while Kz at the metalimnion layer can increase by ti two orders of magnitude during upwelling events. Our results suggest that Kz based on the Richardson number parameterization, which only accounts for large-scale current shear and stability, and incorporates an adjustable parameter is ti ten times higher than the Kz based on the buoyancy Reynolds number. Analysis of historical wind records indicates that the frequency of coastal upwelling favorable winds on the north shore of Lake Ontario has increased by > 45% over the last thirty years - sug-gesting an increasing trend of nearshore-offshore nutrient exchanges as a contributing factor for the nearshore water quality management.Crown Copyright (c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Practical case studies of sustainable tourism are difficult to identify because of the involvement of interrelated variables and dimensions. The study measures the index of sustainability for ecotourism in Lake Kenyir from social, economic, and environmental dimensions. The study follows non-probability convenience sampling design with purposive sampling technique for the sample selection. The study uses 47 indicators under six relationship aspects, namely, resource on community, community on resource, resource on tourism, tourism on resource, tourism on community, and community on tourism to measure the ecotourism sustainability of the study site based on respondent perception. Based on the Barometer of Sustainability, the result demonstrates that Kenyir is classified as "potential sustainable" ecotourism destination. The study identifies four relationship aspects, namely, resource community, resource tourism, community tourism, and tourism community with potential sustainable level. The community and tourism resources have the poorest sustainability, and fall within the potentially unsustainable level. Result reveals the good interrelationship between tourism and community in the study site.					Bhuiyan, Md Anowar Hossain/HCH-7632-2022	Bhuiyan, Md.

Trends of PCB concentrations in Lake Michigan coho and chinook salmon, 1975-2010	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The manufacture and use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was banned in the United States in 1977 after it was determined that these compounds adversely affect animals and humans. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has quantified total PCB concentrations in Lake Michigan chinook (n = 765) and coho (n = 393) salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and Oncorhynchus kisutch, respectively) filets since 1975. We analyzed these data to estimate trends in PCB concentrations in these fish (1975-2010). We used generalized linear models with a gamma error distribution and log link fit to the untransformed concentrations. Trend patterns were examined using graphical smoothing and generalized additive models. We identified a candidate set of models that included time trend and other predictor variables. Using the Akaike Information Criterion to select among models we found the best models for both species included piecewise linear time trends, total body length, % lipid, and collection season as predictor variables. The intersection of the two trends was 1985 for chinook salmon and 1984 for coho salmon. PCB concentrations in both species increased with body length and % lipid, and were higher for individuals caught in the fall. Our data reveals a dramatic decline in PCB concentrations of -16.7% and -23.9% per year for chinook and coho, respectively, up until the intersection year likely reflecting implementation of restrictions on Arodor-based PCBs. After the intersection year to 2010, PCB concentrations declined at an annual rate of -4.0% (95% CI: -4.4% to -3.6%) and -2.6% (95% CI: -33% to -1.9%) for chinook and coho, respectively.

Seasonality of salmonid parasites from flow-through aquaculture in northern Germany: Emphasis on pathogenicity of Diplostomum spp. metacercaria	AQUACULTURE, FISH AND FISHERIES												The aim of the present study was to identify the parasite fauna of cultured rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum, 1792) and Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus (L.)) from a flow-through aquaculture system at Lake Tollense in northern Germany. The fish were sampled during different seasons in 2018 from an open freshwater raceway. For rainbow trout, 10 different parasite species were isolated, belonging to Monogenea (1), Cestoda (2), Crustacea (2) and Digenea (5), including the eye flukes Tylodelphys clavata Niewiadomska, 1984, Diplostomum pseudospathaceum and Diplostomum spathaceum (Rudolphi, 1819) Olsson, 1876, the latter representing a potential pathogenic species, which was molecularly identified and reported as a core species with prevalences of 80.0%-100.0% and high mean abundances of 42.8-55.0. Arctic charr only harboured T. clavata and D. spathaceum. Other taxa were found with low prevalence in the summer season exclusively, indicating strong seasonality of the detected parasites. Statistical correlation was positively tested for coherences of eye fluke burden and fish growth, weight and performance between seasons, recommending implementation of an enhanced aquaculture management for the surface water-dependent flow-through aquaculture system at Lake Tollense.

This successful mass breeding event by at least 5 379 breeding pairs followed two failed attempts due to human disturbance at the same site during preceding years. Egg-laying started relatively late (mid-May) with precocious pairs nesting in the middle of the islet and at a higher nest density. Estimated breeding success was notably high (similar to 5 000 chicks) with apparent good hatching rate and chick survival. Ring sightings indicated that the breeding population was made up in part of adults born in Spain, France and Sardinia, supporting evidence of a metapopulation of nomadic birds breeding and wintering across the Mediterranean Basin. Garaet Ezzemoul does not benefit from any conservation status and is not labelled as a Ramsar site in contrast to some of the neighbouring wetlands. In the light of the key role played by this site, at the regional scale, its status should be reassessed and in view of the threats facing it, urgent conservation measures should be initiated. Local authorities have reacted swiftly in response to the discovery of the breeding colony of the Greater Flamingo, and administrative steps are being taken to formally protect Garaet Ezzemoul.					; Samraoui, Boudjéma/E-6761-2011; Béchet, Arnaud/AAA-4398-2021; OULDJAOUI, Abdallah/HHZ-5687-2022; Moussa, Houhamdi/J-2708-2018	Samraoui, Boudjema/0000-0002-0608-9021; OULDJAOUI, Abdallah/0000-0003-2645-7538; Moussa, Houhamdi/0000-0002-4644-8906; Bechet, Arnaud/0000-0002-0330-6342; 													0030-6525					NOV	2006	77	3-4					153	159		10.2989/00306520609485526	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/00306520609485526													WOS:000243211100007

Concentrations and wet deposition fluxes of total mercury (THg) and methyl mercury (MeHg) were measured from January to December 2006 at 5 sites in Wujiang River Basin, Guizhou, China. Monthly-integrated samples were collected using bulk precipitation samplers. Samples were treated rigorously according to our trace metal protocol, and THg was analyzed by cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry (CVAFS) and MeHg by aqueous phase ethylation, GC separation, and CVAFS detection. The annual volume-weighted mean concentration and wet deposition fluxes of THg and MeHg for 5 sites were 36.0 ng L-1 and 34.7 mu g m(-2) yr(-1), and 0.19 ng L-1 and 0.18 mu g m(-2) yr(-1) in 2006, respectively. The proportion of MeHg to THg ranged from 0.2% to 2.3%, with the mean value of 0.7%. The results also showed that each site had a similar seasonal trend for mercury concentration and wet deposition flux. The largest wet deposition fluxes of THg and MeHg occurred during the rainy season (May-October) when the rainfall was greater, whereas the highest concentrations of THg and MeHg appeared during winter months (December-February). The monthly concentrations of THg and MeHg negatively correlated well with the monthly precipitation depth (r(2)=0.17 and 0.12), suggesting that scavenging of particle-bound mercury from the atmospheric is an important mechanism contribution to mercury in rain.

Four CA methods, including hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), K-means (KM), and fuzzy logic CA methods, fuzzy C-mean (FCM), and genetic K-means (GKM), have been utilized to analyze hydrochemical, chemical, and isotopic datasets, including dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), delta C-13-DIC, delta O-18, and delta H-2 datasets of water resources of Paveh-Javanrud (PV-JR) karstic region, located at the western border of Iran and Iraq countries. The utilized dataset contains 34 water samples with varied origination to evaluate the performance of each model and find the best method based on a meaningful categorization of geological, hydrogeochemical, and isotopic characteristics. Finally, the best model results were matched graphically with developed geospatial graphs to visualize the correlation between the region's water resources. Accordingly, the FCM and GKM methods represent the same, yet meaningful results and have the best performance among the four methods. It was also identified that the PV-JR water resources could be generally categorized into five distinct clusters, including FC1 to FC5 and GK1 to GK5, of which two clusters that have mixing, two clusters with solo-origination and no sign of mixing, and finally, a seasonal spring which is categorized as a separate cluster. Potentially, studying water resources via theoretical methods combined with considering isotope hydrology is of particular interest since solving the environmental issues related to karstic regions and their water resource management are shared concerns in most arid and semi-arid countries, especially in the Middle East as this study, thus could lay a basis for the following scientific attempts involving hydrogeochemical studies and advanced statistical analysis.

To narrow down the point in time when sticklebacks started to colonize the pelagic zone and to reconstruct the build-up of this unprecedented population size, we analysed 18 hydroacoustic surveys from March 2009 to March 2018. As current analysis techniques do not allow discriminating echoes from different fish species of similar size, we considered as sticklebacks all fish smaller than a certain single-target threshold minus the average abundance of small fish well before the sticklebacks invaded the pelagic zone. Our data suggest that sticklebacks colonized the pelagic zone in 2012, one year before they appeared as by-catch in test fisheries. Population density fluctuated between 1280 and 7990 individuals/ha from November 2012 to March 2018 but never fell below 2900 individuals/ha in recent years. These estimates do not include shallow waters where densities might be even higher because the nearshore zone was excluded from our surveys.																			0165-7836	1872-6763				FEB	2019	210						189	192		10.1016/j.fishres.2018.08.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2018.08.002													WOS:000451934800018

In the present study, both indices were applied to zooplankton communities from 16 Greek lakes, covering the entire trophic state spectrum, in order to test their application in a different climatic zone, the Mediterranean. The evaluation of the indices (TSIROT and TSICR) was made comparing the trophic state of each sampling/lake based on TSISD and mean summer phytoplankton biomass. Both indices increased across the eutrophication gradient but misclassify the trophic state. We propose a new index, TSIZOO, the average of the formulae TSIROT and TSICR which are significantly correlated with the eutrophication proxies. All three zooplanktonic indices can efficiently detect low (oligotrophic-mesotrophic) and high (eutrophic-hypertrophic) trophic state using the boundaries < 45 for TSIROT and TSIZOO and < 50 for TSICR. All zooplanktonic indices are promising and effective tools for monitoring and assessment of eutrophication of Mediterranean lakes when mean values are used. Still, TSIZOO should be preferred as the best index that correlated with eutrophication which had the best estimations.					; Michaloudi, Evangelia/AAS-4574-2021	Michaloudi, Evangelia/0000-0001-8194-2865; Moustaka-Gouni, Maria/0000-0002-0845-1928; Stamou, Georgia/0000-0002-0709-3698													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2019	844	1			SI		83	103		10.1007/s10750-018-3880-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-018-3880-9													WOS:000494482800008
J	Martin, E; Gaillou, E				Martin, Erwan; Gaillou, Eloise			Insight on gem opal formation in volcanic ash deposits from a supereruption: A case study through oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of opals from Lake Tecopa, California, USA	AMERICAN MINERALOGIST												At Lake Tecopa, in California, white play-of-color opals are found in vesicles of a volcanic ash layer from the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff super-eruption (2.1 Ma). They show characteristic traits of opal-AG by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (silica spheres of similar to 330 nm). These properties are not typical for volcanic opals, and are usually associated with opals formed in a sedimentary environment, such as opal- AG from Australia. The conditions under which opal was formed at Lake Tecopa were determined by oxygen and hydrogen isotopic analyses and give a better understanding of the formation of opal in general. Tecopa opal's delta O-18 is similar to 30%, which leads to a formation temperature between 5 and 10 degrees C from water composition similar to the present spring water composition (delta O-18 = - 12%), or between 15 and 30 degrees C (the present day spring water temperatures) in water having a delta O-18 between -9.5 and -5.5%. As a result, opal experienced 25- 50% evaporation at the Tecopa basin. Contrary to long- held views, the formation of opal-AG vs. opal-CT (or opal-C) is not determined by the type of deposits, i.e., respectively sedimentary vs. volcanic, but mostly by the temperature of formation, low (<= 45 degrees C for opal- AG) vs. high (>= 160 degrees C for opal-CT) as suggested in most recent papers. The isotopic composition of water contained in Tecopa opals is assessed and results show that water in opal records different stages of opal formation from groundwater. Opal seems to precipitate from groundwater that is undertaking isotopic distillation during its circulation, most likely due to 15% up to 80-95% evaporation. Hydrogen isotopes are poorly documented in opal and require more systematic work, but this study reveals that, in Tecopa opals, molecular water (H2Om) is isotopically heavier than structural water (OH), a phenomena already well known in amorphous volcanic glass. Overall, opal isotopic composition reflects the composition of the water from which it precipitated and for that reason could be (as established for amorphous silicic glass) a useful tool for paleoenvironments, and paleoclimatic reconstitutions on Earth and on other terrestrial planets.

Monthly sampling and high-frequency in situ measurements were conducted for a river reservoir (southeast China) in 2013-2014 to examine the seasonal pattern of nutrients and phytoplankton. We found that nutrient concentrations were runoff-mediated and determined by watershed inputs and, in some cases, by internal cycling depending on hydrology and temperature. Ammonium and phosphate were relatively enriched in February-March (a transitional period from dry/cold to wet/hot climate), which can be ascribed to initial flushing runoff from human/animal waste and spring fertilizer use. A phytoplankton bloom (mainly Chlorophyta) occurred during April after a surge of water temperature, probably due to the higher availability of inorganic nutrients and sunlight and suitable hydraulic residence time (medium flow) in the transitional period. The concentration of phytoplankton was low during May-June (wet-hot climate) when the concentrations of total suspended matter (TSM) were highest, likely owing to the "shading" effect of TSM and turbulence of high flow conditions. Nutrient-algae shifts across the dry-wet season and vertical profiles suggested that algal blooms seem to be fueled primarily by phosphate and ammonium rather than nitrate. Current findings of a strong temporal pattern and the relationship between physical parameters, nutrient and biota would improve our understanding of drivers of change in water quality and ecosystem functions with dam construction.

Environmental Controls on Microbial Diversity in Arctic Lakes of West Greenland	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												We assessed the microbial community structure of six arctic lakes in West Greenland and investigated relationships to lake physical and chemical characteristics. Lakes from the ice sheet region exhibited the highest species richness, while inland and plateau lakes had lower observed taxonomical diversity. Lake habitat differentiation during summer stratification appeared to alter within lake microbial community composition in only a subset of lakes, while lake variability across regions was a consistent driver of microbial community composition in these arctic lakes. Principal coordinate analysis revealed differentiation of communities along two axes: each reflecting differences in morphometric (lake surface area), geographic (latitude and distance from the ice sheet), physical lake variables (water clarity), and lakewater chemistry (dissolved organic carbon [DOC], dissolved oxygen [DO], total nitrogen [TN], and conductivity). Understanding these relationships between environmental variables and microbial communities is especially important as heterotrophic microorganisms are key to organic matter decomposition, nutrient cycling, and carbon flow through nutrient poor aquatic environments in the Arctic.					; Somers, Dana/HLX-1378-2023	Strock, Kristin/0000-0003-3758-9368; Somers, Dana/0000-0003-1814-2050													0095-3628	1432-184X				JUL	2020	80	1					60	72		10.1007/s00248-019-01474-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-019-01474-9								31848649					WOS:000545690700006

We determined how temperature, population structure, and age-specific consumption influenced walleye growth and consumption during 1986-1995. For each year, we used individual-based bioenergetics modeling to compare growth and consumption by walleye in Lake Erie's western or central basin with those of walleye moving seasonally between basins. Population structure strongly affected walleye growth and consumption but had little influence on interbasin growth rate comparisons. Based on water temperature alone, growth and consumption by western basin walleye were generally lower than for central basin or migratory populations and were more limited by summer water temperatures. In simulations combining effects of population structure, temperature, and age-specific consumption, migratory walleye grew most rapidly, taking advantage of temperature-related growth peaks in both basins. Estimates of walleye predatory demand declined with population size from 1988 through 1995. With natural feedbacks, predatory demand interacts with prey production, limiting walleye reproductive potential when prey availability is low. However, immediate impact on predatory inertia is limited, complicating our ability to predict how predatory demand and prey availability interact in Lake Erie.

First Report of Abundant Rudd Populations in North America	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The Rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus was first introduced into U.S. waters about a century ago, and the species' popularity as a baitfish in the 1980s has facilitated its spread to at least 21 states and the province of Ontario. Several established populations have been identified, but low abundances have led to little research and management attention. Rudds comprised 48.7% of the 14,130 fish captured in spring trap-netting surveys of Buffalo Harbor (northeastern Lake Erie) and the upper Niagara River during 2007-2008. Rudd was the most abundant species sampled, being captured at 11 of 12 locations and comprising 23.6% of the total catch in Buffalo Harbor and 70.3% of the catch in the upper Niagara River. Documented presences and absences in historical reports indicate that rudd became established in these waters between 1986 and 1991. Research is needed to understand the effects of rudds on native aquatic resources, especially nearshore macrophyte assemblages and the fish they support.																			0275-5947	1548-8675					2012	32	1					82	86		10.1080/02755947.2012.661391	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2012.661391													WOS:000301046200011

Productivity of Ospreys, Pandion haliaetus, Affected by Water Levels Near Loon Lake, Saskatchewan, 1975-2002	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												Between 1975 and 2002, diminished breeding success of Ospreys was associated with drought and falling lake levels in the western half of our study area near the town of Loon Lake, west-central Saskatchewan. Only 46% of nest attempts were successful in the west compared to 72% in the east, producing 0.88 young per accessible nest in the west and 1.42 in the east. Breeding success was greater in the eastern half, where water levels were stable, in spite of increased human use of the resort lakes there.

AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL LETTERS												Watershed management for lakes and reservoirs largely focuses on external sources, but internal sources, such as sediment P release, can be important. This study quantified sediment P release in Lake Tenkiller, Oklahoma, in summer 2016. Eight intact sediment-water cores were collected from the riverine and transition zone and then incubated at 22 degrees C for 8 d under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Phosphorus mass in the overlying water of all cores increased with time, and the rate of increase was significantly greater under anaerobic conditions. Sediment P release was reflective of eutrophic and hypereutrophic conditions, measuring up to 15.2 mg m(-2) d(-1). Sediment P fluxes were four to five times greater than the net flux predicted by the model of Lake Tenkiller, suggesting that internal P sources need to be considered in the total maximum daily load process.

The principal infectious agent of this infestation is a fungal species, Aphanomyces invadans. Different fungal species were isolated from EUS infected Channa punctatus fish from Hasanparthy Lake of Warangal, Telangana, India. Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium solani, Rhizophus stolenifer, Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicillium chrysogenum, Aspergillus niger and Trichoderma viridae were most isolated groups. Isolates have been obtained and ability to induce dermal lesions in infectivity studies make fungi is one of the likely primary aetiological agents that could be triggering the initiation to EUS. Fungi was observed as persistent infections in fishes evidenced by their presence in cell culture also require further investigations for their role in predisposing the freshwater fish of C. punctatus. The environmental conditions were also found in fluctuation during the winter season. In the present study isolation of fungal pathogens from infected fish like Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium solani, Rhizophus stolenifer, Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicillium chrysogenum, Aspergillus niger and Trichoderma viridae had shown its presence in fungal incidence percentage throughout the year.																			0975-8232					SEP	2017	8	9					3830	3836		10.13040/IJPSR.0975-8232.8(9).3830-36	http://dx.doi.org/10.13040/IJPSR.0975-8232.8(9).3830-36													WOS:000416102900025

The fish catches have also decreased drastically at the same time. Many rivers flow in to the lake. Among them, the Nagaragawa, the Takazumi, and the Fukui rivers are the big three. The lake water flows out to the Sea of Japan only through the Koyama. The flows of the Nagaragawa, Takazumi and Fukui rivers are 36.9, 4.78 and 14.04 ton/minute, respectively. Therefore, the origin of the pollutant load is primarily these rivers and by focusing on the rivers as pollutant sources, this paper studies the vertical variation of dissolved oxygen in the lake, which is closely related to the survival of fish. One of the most important results in this study is that the low-dissolved oxygen layer was found many times at about 4 similar to5 m below the water surface even in Autumn. This is because the seawater with heavier specific gravity remained immovable. This suggests the necessity of aeration for the survival of fish.																					974-8202-77-1				2000							401	405																WOS:000167523600053

A decrease in sinking rates to neutral buoyancy at 17.5-22.5 m, an area of high nutrients and low light, coupled with sedimentation estimates 106-107 cells.cntdot.m-2.cntdot.d-1, provide strong evidence that diatoms contribute to the formation of a seasonal deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM). The position of the Sproat Lake DCM, occurring at or just above 1% light depth, appears to be largely determined by the light regime. R. eriensis bloomed and sank out of the mixed layer early in the spring before lake fertilization began. Immediately after fertilization, concentrations of nitrate and phosphate were elevated for 1 h only in the top 1 m of the water column. Most R. eriensis cells were well below 1 m and benefited little from the nutrient addition because of temporal and spatial separation. Cyclotella spp. occurred in the upper epilimnion and bloomed later in the year and consequently benefited (by large density increases) from fertilization. It is important to consider the temporal and spatial distribution of phytoplankton in determining which species will increase in abudance as a result of areal fertilization.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	1990	47	1					128	135		10.1139/f90-013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f90-013													WOS:A1990CG69300013

Previous hydrologic investigations on the water level decline in Poyang Lake were conducted mostly during recession season and typical dry years and hence lacked the comprehensive view of associated risks and possible spatial heterogeneity of trend during low water level periods. The present study reassessed the long-term trend and regime shift of low water level vari-ations and their associated risks based on hydrological data across multiple stations in Poyang Lake during 1952-2021. The underlying causes of the trends of water level decline were further investigated. Results showed uneven trends and risks of water level variations in different seasons and across different lake regions. The water level of all five hydrological stations in Poyang Lake significantly dropped in the recession season, and the risks of water level decline evidently increased since 2003, which could be largely attributed to the water level drop in the Yangtze River. In terms of the dry season, clear spatial differences of long-term trend of water level were found, with water level in the central and southern lake regions significantly dropping, which was probably caused by dramatic bathymetry undercutting in the central and northern lake regions. In addition, the impacts of topographic changes became significant when water level of Hukou fell below 13.8 and 11.8m for the northern and southern lake regions, respectively. By contrast, water level in the northern lake region showed increasing trends in the dry season. In addition, only the occurrence time of water level under moderate risk significantly advanced for all stations except for Hukou. The present study could provide a full picture of low water level trends, associated risks across different lake regions and underlying causes in Poyang Lake, thus providing in-sights into adaptive water resources management.

According to our data, the surface layer of shelf water was supersaturated up to 2500% relative to the present average atmospheric methane content of 1.85 ppm. Anomalously high concentrations ( up to 154 nM or 4400% supersaturation) of dissolved methane in the bottom layer of shelf water suggest that the bottom layer is somehow affected by near-bottom sources.

During the past 30 yr in the Atlantic Provinces of Canada many field abandoned from other forms of agriculture are brought into stands of this species by burn-pruning and selective weed control.																			0008-3550						1979	93	4					415	430																WOS:A1979HW06600010
J	Hofer, JS; Sommaruga, R				Hofer, JS; Sommaruga, R			Seasonal dynamics of viruses in an alpine lake: importance of filamentous forms	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Viruses are an important component of the planktonic food web in freshwater and marine systems, but most studies have been done in the ocean and in lowland lakes. In this work, the seasonal dynamics and structure of the virioplankton as well as their impact on bacteria during a day/night cycle were studied in an alpine lake located 2417 m above sea level. The abundance of virus-like particles (VLP) was determined at 5 discrete depths (0.5 to 8 m) by direct counts with a TEM in samples collected from May to November 1998 at weekly to bi-weekly intervals. Viruses reached the highest abundances under ice (4.6 x 10(6) VLP ml(-1)) with a second maximum in autumn. After ice-break, the VLP abundance decreased to undetectable values (<2 x 10(4) VLP ml(-1)) probably because of the negative effect of solar radiation that was negatively correlated with the viral abundance in the upper 2 ra of the water column (Spearman rank correlation, r(s) = -0.773, p < 0.01). The virioplankton was morphologically diverse, consisting of forms commonly found in other aquatic systems, but unlike other studies, we found filamentous VLP (FVLP) 450 to 730 run long that attained abundances of up to 1.3 x 10(6) ml(-1) and accounted for 7 to 100% of the total viral abundance. These FVLP were found occasionally inside filamentous heterotrophic bacteria (> 10 mum) and their respective abundances were positively correlated (r(s) = 0.728, p < 0.01). The absence of these conspicuous forms in other aquatic ecosystems suggests that FVLP are well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions or are specific to bacterial hosts found in alpine lakes. Finally, between 5 and 28% of the newly produced bacteria were killed by non-filamentous viruses, which therefore are a modest cause of bacterial mortality in this lake.

Previous phytoplankton studies in these lakes have shown that prolonged cyanobacterial blooms can occur, which are dominated by known toxic species, as well as other less known, co-occurring species. A total of 118 clones were sequenced which were grouped in 23 Cyanobacteria and 11 chloroplast-like phylotypes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that each library included several unique phylotypes, as well as members of all common bloom-forming Cyanobacteria. Most of the phylotypes belonged to the genera Microcystis, Anabaena, Aphanizomenon, Cylindrospermopsis-Raphidiopsis group, Limnothrix and Planktothrix, comprising most of the diversity previously recognized by morphological observations in cyanobacterial morphospecies in these lakes. In addition, novel phylotypes belonging to the Chroococcales were recognized in both lakes. The structure of the cyanobacterial communities of the lakes were very similar, as revealed by 1 he diversity index H (2.06 and 2.01 for L Doirani and Kastoria, respectively) and LIBSHUFF analysis (XY12 P-value = 0.122 and YX12 P-value = 0.536), due to occurrence of groups of common phylotypes. This study gives an example for successful cyanobacterial bloom analysis by the combination of morphological and phylogenetic methods useful for monitoring cyanobacteria and water quality in freshwaters.

J	Dyer, JL				Dyer, Jamie L.			BASIN-SCALE PRECIPITATION ANALYSIS FOR SOUTHEAST US WATERSHEDS USING HIGH-RESOLUTION RADAR PRECIPITATION ESTIMATES	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												The southeastern United States maintains a sensitivity to water resources for agriculture, hydroelectric power production, and basic environmental sustainability; therefore, it is important to understand the patterns of regional precipitation variability. Since high resolution precipitation data are necessary to estimate the local precipitation distribution over each basin, radar-derived precipitation estimates from 1996-2006 will be used for analysis. To quantify regional patterns of precipitation in the southeast United States, analysis will be conducted over three individual watersheds in the southeast: the Yazoo River watershed, the Savannah River watershed, and the Everglades/Lake Okeechobee drainage in southern Florida. Results of the study show a clear separation between maximum warm-season precipitation depth and frequency over southern Florida. In the Savannah River, precipitation maxima in the mountainous headwaters and coastal lowlands are revealed, along with a third peak in the southern Piedmont due to a localized affect resulting from spatial changes in soil characteristics. The Yazoo River watershed shows a similar effect during the summer months, leading to heightened precipitation in the eastern portion of the basin. Additionally, this study shows that radar-derived multisensor precipitation estimates are a viable data source for analyzing spatial and temporal precipitation patterns for the purposes of water resources research.

J	Harman, WN; Hingula, LP; MacNamara, CE				Harman, WN; Hingula, LP; MacNamara, CE			Does long-term macrophyte management in lakes affect biotic richness and diversity?	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												We hypothesize that the richness and diversity of the biota in Lake Moraine (42 degrees 50'47"N, 75 degrees 31'39"W) in New York have been negatively impacted by 60 years of macrophyte and algae management to control Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.) and associated noxious plants. To test this hypothesis we compare water quality characteristics, richness and selected indicators of plant diversity, zooplankton, benthic macroinvertebrates and fish in Lake Moraine with those in nearby Hatch Lake (42 degrees 50'06"N, 75 degrees 40'67"W). The latter is of similar size and would be expected to have similar biota, but has not been subjected to management. Measurements of temperature, pH, oxygen, conductivity, Secchi transparency, calcium, total phosphorus and nitrites + nitrates are comparable. Taxa richness and the diversity indices applied to the aquatic macrophytes are similar in both lakes. The greatest disparity is the lack of Eurasian watermilfoil and Canadian waterweed (Elodea canadensis Michx.) in the main basin of Lake Moraine. The elimination of the former was the intent of a 2001 application of fluridone (1-methyl-3phenyl-5(3-(trifuromethyl)phenyl)-4(1H)-pyridinone[C19H14F3N0]) and the loss of the latter was a related consequence. Zooplankton richness is similar in both lakes. The diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates is similar; however, richness at the genus level is quite different. There is a paucity of species collected in Lake Moraine that are intolerant to winter lowering of water levels. Fish species richness in both lakes is similar, but there are differences in specific taxa and percent abundance directly related to stocking and the balance between forage fish populations and piscivorous fish populations in the two lakes. That phenomenon also appears responsible for some of the variation in the zooplankton communities in both lakes. Overall, taxonomic richness and diversity in Lake Moraine and Hatch Lake are remarkably similar. Annual winter drawdown of water levels is implicated as having greater effect on the biota than long-term herbicide utilization. The hypothesis is rejected.																			0146-6623					JUL	2005	43						57	64																WOS:000233953400001

Although much effort has been spent to assess and predict changes in surface water resources, little has been done to understand how climatic events and changes affect groundwater resources. This study focuses on characterizing and quantifying the effects of large, multiyear, quasi-decadal groundwater recharge events in the northern Utah portion of the Great Basin for the period 1960-2013. Annual groundwater level data were analyzed with climatic data to characterize climatic conditions and frequency of these large recharge events. Using observed water-level changes and multivariate analysis, five large groundwater recharge events were identified with a frequency of about 11-13 years. These events were generally characterized as having above-average annual precipitation and snow water equivalent and below-average seasonal temperatures, especially during the spring (April through June). Existing groundwater flow models for several basins within the study area were used to quantify changes in groundwater storage from these events. Simulated groundwater storage increases per basin from a single recharge event ranged from about 115 to 205 Mm(3). Extrapolating these amounts over the entire northern Great Basin indicates that a single large quasi-decadal recharge event could result in billions of cubic meters of groundwater storage. Understanding the role of these large quasi-decadal recharge events in replenishing aquifers and sustaining water supplies is crucial for long-term groundwater management.																			0043-1397	1944-7973				OCT	2016	52	10					7819	7836		10.1002/2016WR019060	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016WR019060													WOS:000388493400017
J	Bergman, E; Bergstrand, E				Bergman, E; Bergstrand, E			Lack of a top-down effect on the zooplankton community after a cyprinid reduction	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Abundance, biomass and sizes of crustaceans were followed before, during and after a fish reduction in the three basins of Lake Ringsjon, southern Sweden. Zooplankton were sampled over the summer season (May-September) for eight years. Although the fish reduction occurred in different years in the three basins, the zooplankton community did not differ between basins. Between-year differences in biomass occurred in all basins, but these were not correlated with the time before and after the fish reduction, with the exception of the Eubosmina species. Analyses were performed on total biomass, as well as on biomass of Daphnia galeata, D. cucullata, Bosmina longirostris, Eubosmina coregoni, E. crassicornis, calanoid and cyclopoid copepods. Both calanoid copepods and Daphnia cucullata were larger before, than after the fish reduction. The same was true for a proportional length measurement of all grazers (=cladocerans+calanoid copepods). We found no evidence of a top-down effect on zooplankton biomass or length following the reduction in planktivorous fish. The possibility of an 'indirect bottom-up effect' due to cyprinid fish directly affecting nutrient availability is discussed.

This paper presents the data of field experiment carried out in autumn of 2006 and discusses the characteristics of the vertical mixing in the halocline and the horizontal circulations in the surface mixed layer. The experiment was composed of two kinds of measurements: (1) Vertical profile of horizontal velocity was collected by three A.DCPs set on the bottom of the north, the center, and the south water areas for two months. (2) Horizontal flow field was searched in wide areas from three boats equipped with ADCP in three days of November. The data from the first measurement showed a periodic appearance of intense shear layer in the halocline that seemed to be generated by internal seiche. The data from the second measurement showed the existence of rather stable currents in the surface mixed layer. These facts suggested that substances entrained from anaerobic hypolimnion by the shear motion in the halocline are carried by the stable horizontal current in the mixed layer to form uneven condition of water environment in the lake.																					978-7-302-18662-5				2009							1365	+		10.1007/978-3-540-89465-0_239	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-89465-0_239													WOS:000268750701041

POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON COASTAL CLIMATE AND THE WATER-BALANCE	CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN												The proposed GRAND Canal project calls for the damming of James Bay and the diversion of its water southward. This first part of a two-part study models some potential impacts on the climate, water balance, and growth patterns in the James Bay coastal zone. Use is made of a linear relationship of Bowen ratio and temperature, developed from studies of coastal wetlands in southern and north-western James Bay and central Hudson Bay. It is hypothesized that changing James Bay into a fresh-water lake and disrupting its coastal currents would result in a delayed Bay ice melt of unknown length in the spring, Allowing a delay to vary between 0 and 30 days results in the prediction of lesser evaporation and greater water surplus. These differences in magnitude increase with the length of delayed melt, but in all cases are most strongly evident during the peak of the growing season. Colder and wetter conditions would have a strong ecological impact on all coastal areas of western and southern James Bay. In the northwest this could change the species composition of coastal flora, cause forests to retreat from the coast, and result in the growth of permafrost there.																			0008-3658					SPR	1992	36	1					2	7		10.1111/j.1541-0064.1992.tb01108.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0064.1992.tb01108.x													WOS:A1992JL86300001
J	Elliott, JA; Defew, L				Elliott, J. A.; Defew, L.			Modelling the response of phytoplankton in a shallow lake (Loch Leven, UK) to changes in lake retention time and water temperature	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The phytoplankton community of Loch Leven in 2005 was modelled and subjected to a combination of different flushing rates and water temperatures in order to assess the lake's sensitivity to these two climatic drivers. Whilst the simulated annual mean total chlorophyll a proved relatively insensitive to these changes, at the species level marked changes were recorded. Some species responded positively to increased temperature (e.g. Aulacoseira), some negatively (e.g. Asterionella), whilst others were negatively affected by increased flow (e.g. Aphanocapsa) and others enhanced (e.g. Stephanodiscus). However, this relationship with flow was season dependent with, for example, a simulated increase in summer inflows actually benefiting some species through increased nutrient supply, whereas an equivalent increase in flow in wetter seasons would have negatively affected those species (i.e. through flushing loss). Overall, the simulations showed that the range of species types simulated in the community was sufficient for one species to always benefit from the changing niches created by the multiple climatic drivers applied in this study. The level of exploitation by such a species was only constrained by the nutrient carrying capacity of the system, which led to the overall dampened response in the total chlorophyll a measure, both at the annual and season scale. Thus, whilst overall biomass showed relatively little reaction to the two climatic drivers tested, the phytoplankton community composition responded markedly.

Seasonal and event-based drivers of runoff and phosphorus export through agricultural tile drains under sandy loam soil in a cool temperate region	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Frequent algal blooms in surface water bodies caused by nutrient loading from agricultural lands are an ongoing problem in many regions globally. Tile drains beneath poorly and imperfectly drained agricultural soils have been identified as key pathways for phosphorus (P) transport. Two tile drains in an agricultural field with sandy loam soil in southern Ontario, Canada were monitored over a 28-month period to quantify discharge and the concentrations and loads of dissolved reactive P (DRP) and total P (TP) in their effluent. This paper characterizes seasonal differences in runoff generation and P export in tile drain effluent and relates hydrologic and biogeochemical responses to precipitation inputs and antecedent soil moisture conditions. The generation of runoff in tile drains was only observed above a clear threshold soil moisture content (similar to 0.49m(3)center dot m(-3) in the top 10cm of the soil; above field capacity and close to saturation), indicating that tile discharge responses to precipitation inputs were governed by the available soil-water storage capacity of the soil. Soil moisture content approached this threshold throughout the non-growing season (October - April), leading to runoff responses to most events. Concentrations of P in effluent were variable throughout the study but were not correlated with discharge (p > 0.05). However, there were significant relationships between discharge volume (mm) and DRP and TP loads (kg ha(-1)) for events occurring over the study period (R-2 >= 0.49, p <= 0.001). This research has shown that the hydrologic and biogeochemical responses of tile drains in a sandy loam soil can be predicted to within an order of magnitude from simple hydrometric data such as precipitation and soil moisture once baseline conditions at a site have been determined.

J	Gillet, C				Gillet, Christian			Egg production in a whitefish (Coregonus shinzi palea) brood stock: effects of photoperiod on the timing of spawning and the quality of eggs	AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES												The results of preliminary experiments in the development of a hatchery brood stock of whitefish of Lake Geneva, Coregonus shinzi palea Cuv. and Val. (lavaretus), are described. Factors likely to influence the date of spawning and the quality of eggs were studied by reference to the performance of wild spawners from the Lake Geneva. Fish were reared in tanks and the ovulation of females occurred spontaneously at the same spawning time as in wild spawners from the lake. Reared females have produced 30 000 eggs/kg against 45 000 in wild fish. The survival rate of a domestic egg was about 10% less than that of wild females. Since the overripening of the ova was rapid it was necessary to check the ripe females twice a week. The exposure of fish to long days in autumn delayed spawning by two months and permitted the synchronization of hatching under optimal conditions of growth. The ovulations were spread over a period of 3 months when the fish were subjected to long days until spawning. In contrast, termination of the long day regime in December induced a synchronization of the ovulations over just one month.																			0990-7440	1765-2952				JAN	1991	4	1					33	39		10.1051/alr:1991003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/alr:1991003													WOS:000209003000004
J	Negandhi, K; Laurion, I; Lovejoy, C				Negandhi, Karita; Laurion, Isabelle; Lovejoy, Connie			Temperature effects on net greenhouse gas production and bacterial communities in arctic thaw ponds	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												One consequence of High Arctic permafrost thawing is the formation of small ponds, which release greenhouse gases (GHG) from stored carbon through microbial activity. Under a climate with higher summer air temperatures and longer ice-free seasons, sediments of shallow ponds are likely to become warmer, which could influence enzyme kinetics or select for less cryophilic microbes. There is little data on the direct temperature effects on GHG production and consumption or on microbial communities' composition in Arctic ponds. We investigated GHG production over 16 days at 4A degrees C and 9A degrees C in sediments collected from four thaw ponds. Consistent with an enzymatic response, production rates of CO2 and CH4 were significantly greater at higher temperatures, with Q(10) varying from 1.2 to 2.5. The bacterial community composition from one pond was followed through the incubation by targeting the V6-V8 variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene and 16S rRNA. Several rare taxa detected from rRNA accounted for significant community compositional changes. At the higher temperature, the relative community contribution from Bacteroidetes decreased by 15% with compensating increases in Betaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Actinobacteria. The increase in experimental GHG production accompanied by changes in community indicates an additional factor to consider in sediment environments when evaluating future climate scenarios.Greenhouse gas emissions from Arctic thaw pond sediment increased at warmer temperatures, consistent with changes in the bacterial community after 16 days.Greenhouse gas emissions from Arctic thaw pond sediment increased at warmer temperatures, consistent with changes in the bacterial community after 16 days.					; Lovejoy, Connie/A-3756-2008	Laurion, Isabelle/0000-0001-8694-3330; Lovejoy, Connie/0000-0001-8027-2281; Negandhi, Karita/0000-0002-2463-3414													0168-6496	1574-6941				AUG	2016	92	8							fiw117	10.1093/femsec/fiw117	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiw117								27288196					WOS:000383230500013

Two different phenotypes were present on fine sediments (< 150 mum) in the eastern basin. An elongated white morph was common on the profundal sediments beyond 40 m depth, while the ''quagga'' mussel was common on sand and sandy silt at depths between 10 and 30 m. Together with the carinated zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, which is very abundant on hard substrates in the sublittoral region, at least 80% of Lake Erie's bottom sediments have been invaded by Dreissena.

J	Ishiwatari, R; Uemura, H; Yamamoto, S				Ishiwatari, Ryoshi; Uemura, Hitoshi; Yamamoto, Shuichi			Hopanoid hydrocarbons and perylene in Lake Biwa (Japan) sediments: Environmental control on their abundance and molecular composition	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												We examined the vertical distribution of hopanoid hydrocarbons and perylene in sedimentary sections from Lake Biwa (Japan) and discuss the results with respect to paleoenvironmental information from around the lake region over the last 120 kyr. Moretene concentration was high above the sections where fall-out events of tephra (tephra AT) occurred ca. 30 kyr before present (BP). This feature suggests that the tephra fall-out events created O-2 deficient conditions, resulting in high activity of methane producing bacteria, and of methanotrophic moretene-producing bacteria becoming active above the tephra layer. Five sections at 10-20 kyr, ca. 35 kyr, ca. 70 kyr, ca. 90 kyr and ca. 110 kyr BP exhibited peaks in the ratio of 17 alpha, 21 beta-22R-homohopane to 17 beta, 21 beta-22R-homohopane (hopC(31)alpha beta/beta beta). The n-C-23/n-C-31 alkane ratio in these sections was 0.6 +/- 0.1 (n = 49), very low if compared with typical characteristics of n-alkanes for a Sphagnum peat environment (n-C-23/n-C-31 ca. 3.6; Bingham et al., 2010). We conclude that Sphagnum peat may not have been an important contributor of n-alkanes over the past 120 kyr. Comparison with previous pollen records for the lake region suggests that high hopC(31)alpha beta/beta beta values may be caused by production of acidic soil from expansion of temperate conifer (e.g. Cryptomeria) forest under cold and wet climate conditions. The abundance of perylene relative to sediment or total organic carbon (TOC) was high in the sections at ca. 20 kyr, ca. 70 kyr and ca. 90 kyr BP. These sections were approximately in accord with those having a maximum in hopC(31)alpha beta/beta beta. This concordance indicates that the climatic conditions suitable for the production of perylene quinone in soil surrounding the lake coincided with those for a high hopC(31)alpha beta/beta beta ratio. Thus, hopC(31)alpha beta/beta beta and perylene/TOC might be useful as proxies of soil acidity, temperature and humidity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hebert, CE; Shutt, JL; Norstrom, RJ				Hebert, CE; Shutt, JL; Norstrom, RJ			Dietary changes cause temporal fluctuations in polychlorinated biphenyl levels in herring gull eggs from Lake Ontario	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												After adjusting Lake Ontario herring gull egg PCB concentrations for the influence of time, an analysis was conducted to explain the remaining variation in annual egg PCB concentrations. In years with cold winters and/or high alewife abundance, egg PCB concentrations were greater than predicted. PCB levels were also greater than predicted in years when alewife condition was low. Increasing the proportion of alewives in the gull's diet may lead to increased PCB levels in eggs. Stable isotope analysis ([N-15]/[N-14]) of herring gull eggs provided evidence supporting this hypothesis. Consumption of alewives by gulls (as influenced by gull metabolism, alewife abundance/condition, and alewife overwinter mortality) and alewife population characteristics (growth rates and age distribution) may be the keys to explaining fluctuations in Lake Ontario herring gull egg PCB levels.																			0013-936X					APR	1997	31	4					1012	1017		10.1021/es960408p	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es960408p													WOS:A1997WR54600035

Giving a solution to the issue of sedimentation is a complicated task and maybe one of the most important engineering and environmental challenges of the 21st century. The deposited volume and the distribution pattern of the sediment are often unknown and not easy to assess. The sedimentation process is highly dynamic, initially due to the hydrological conditions of the incoming rivers, but also due to common internal phenomena like resuspension or density currents. Sediment remediation measures such as mechanical sediment removal or flushing are planned based on the sediment thickness distribution and the overall sediment volume/ mass. Often, the sediment thickness is calculated through topographic differencing between the preimpoundment reservoir lake bottom and the actual lake bottom. However, it is common that the previous depth distribution map is not available or in insufficient quality. In this regard, alternative measurement techniques have to be taken into consideration. In this study, we assessed the best possible approach depending on the characteristics of the sediment and of the reservoir. We combined three different acoustic systems (a multibeam, a sub-bottom profiler, and a single beam dual frequency system) with sediment coring and dynamic free fall penetrometer measurements for an improved assessment of sediment stock and sediment distribution in the Passa?na Reservoir. Our results showed that topographic differencing could not be applied, as the data for the pre-impoundment lake bottom was insufficiently accurate. The parametric sub-bottom profiler could detect the sediment thickness in high accuracy, but significant limitations were recorded in areas with high gas contents. The dual-frequency echosounder derived the sediment thickness with a normalized mean absolute error of 56% due to the high volumetric gas content in the sediment. The dynamic free-fall penetrometer showed satisfying results compared to the other systems. The normalized mean absolute error was 22%, and sediment thickness could be detected in areas with up to 1.8 m of sediment. Sediment coring is also a reliable technique for sediment thickness determination. However, the results showed that if only traditional coring devices are used (gravity corer), the limited penetration depth of the equipment combined with sampling disturbances often prevent a correct assessment of the sediment thickness. The overall results of this study can help for an improved decisionmaking regarding reservoir management. The accurate assessment of sediment volume and distribution can reduce costs for sediment removal and assist in having a precise overview of the reservoir lifetime.					; Hilgert, Stephan/I-1289-2012; Mannich, Michael/L-9660-2014; Bleninger, Tobias/H-3269-2012	Sotiri, Klajdi/0000-0003-3370-7355; Mannich, Michael/0000-0002-5727-2563; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				JUN 1	2021	287								112298	10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112298	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112298		MAR 2021						33730673					WOS:000639201100002
J	Wei, HQ; Liu, GM; Gill, J				Wei, Haiquan; Liu, Guoming; Gill, James			Review of eruptive activity at Tianchi volcano, Changbaishan, northeast China: implications for possible future eruptions	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												One of the largest explosive eruptions in the past several thousand years occurred at Tianchi volcano, also known as Changbaishan, on the China-North Korea border. This historically active polygenetic central volcano consists of three parts: a lower basaltic shield, an upper trachytic composite cone, and young comendite ash flows. The Millennium Eruption occurred between 938 and 946AD, and was preceded by two smaller and chemically different rhyolitic pumice deposits. There has been at least one additional, small eruption in the last three centuries. From 2002 to 2005, seismicity, deformation, and the helium and hydrogen gas contents of spring waters all increased markedly, causing regional concern. We attribute this event to magma recharge or volatile exhalation or both at depth, followed by two episodes of addition of magmatic fluids into the overlying aquifer without a phreatic eruption. The estimated present magma accumulation rate is too low by itself to account for the 2002-2005 unrest. The most serious volcanic hazards are ash eruption and flows, and lahars. The available geological information and volcano monitoring data provide a baseline for comprehensive assessment of future episodes of unrest and possible eruptive activity.

Cultivable bacterial diversity of alkaline Lonar Lake, India	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Aerobic, alkaliphilic bacteria were isolated and characterized from water and sediment samples collected in the winter season, January 2002 from alkaline Lonar lake, India, having pH 10.5. The total number of microorganisms in the sediment and water samples was found to be 10(2)-10(6) cfu g(-1) and 10(2)-10(4) cfu ml(-1), respectively. One hundred and ninety-six strains were isolated using different enrichment media. To study the bacterial diversity of Lonar lake and to select the bacterial strains for further characterization, screening was done on the basis of pH and salt tolerance of the isolates. Sixty-four isolates were subjected to phenotypic, biochemical characterization and 16S rRNA sequencing. Out of 64, 31 bacterial isolates were selected on the basis of their enzyme profile and further subjected to phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that most of the Lonar lake isolates were related to the phylum Firmicutes, containing Low G+C, Gram-positive bacteria, with different genera: Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Alkalibacillus, Exiguobacterium, Planococcus, Enterococcus and Vagococcus. Seven strains constituted a Gram-negative bacterial group, with different genera: Halomonas, Stenotrophomonas and Providencia affiliated to gamma-Proteobacteria, Alcaligenes to beta-Proteobacteria and Paracoccus to alpha-Proteobacteria. Only five isolates were High G+C, Gram-positive bacteria associated with phylum Actinobacteria, with various genera: Cellulosimicrobium, Dietzia, Arthrobacter and Micrococcus. Despite the alkaline pH of the Lonar lake, most of the strains were alkalitolerant and only two strains were obligate alkaliphilic. Most of the isolates produced biotechnologically important enzymes at alkaline pH, while only two isolates (ARI 351 and ARI 341) showed the presence of polyhydroxyalkcanoate (PHA) and exopolysaccharide (EPS), respectively.

J	HORN, W; HORN, H				HORN, W; HORN, H			INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CRUSTACEAN ZOOPLANKTON AND PHYTOPLANKTON - RESULTS FROM 15 YEARS OF FIELD OBSERVATIONS AT THE MESOTROPHIC SAIDENBACH RESERVOIR (GERMANY)	HYDROBIOLOGIA					3rd International Symposium on Cladocera as Model Organisms in Biology	AUG 09-16, 1993	BERGEN, NORWAY					Fifteen years of data (1975-1990) on the phyto- and crustacean plankton in the meso/eutrophic Saidenbach Reservoir were analysed to reveal correlations between these groups or members of them. The weekly or fortnightly samples were collected from different depths and times, and were integrated to form seasonal averages. For the dominant organisms, summer means of abundance were plotted against one another. Among the Crustacea, Daphnia galeata exerts a strong influence on nanoplankton resulting in an increased Secchi depth in years with a high standing stock of Daphnia. No such correlations were found for Eudiaptomus and the Cyclopoida, which are not able to remove such small particles. The abundance of Daphnia showed no obvious effects on Cyanophyta, colony forming Chlorophyta and Asterionella formosa. This implies that in the Saidenbach Reservoir, factors other than crustacean grazing are of crucial importance for the population dynamics of the latter algal groups. It is shown, that the influence of the Crustacea on the phytoplankton is evident not only for short periods, i.e. in clear-water stages, or in biomanipulated lakes, but also can be observed under 'non-manipulated' conditions for longer time periods.																			0018-8158					JUL 7	1995	307	1-3					231	238		10.1007/BF00032017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00032017													WOS:A1995RY51900029

Physicochemical parameters did not differ among three lakes, except for NO(3) concentrations. Seventy-six phytoplankton taxa were found in all three lakes combined, including 29 Bacillariophyceae, 4 Chrysophyceae, 15 Chlorophyceae, 9 Charophyceae (Zygnematales), 16 Cyanophyceae, and 3 Dinophyceae. Lakes Modro Oko, Desne and Kuti showed 18, 24 and 57 taxa, respectively. Asterionella formosa, Fragilaria ulna and Pediastrum clathratum were common to all three lakes. Similarity coefficients (Jaccard index) of Modro Oko and Desne, Modro Oko and Kuti, and Kuti and Desne were, respectively, 13.2%, 12.3% and 23.9%. The highest mean values of surface phytoplankton density in Modro Oko (695 cells L(-1)) Desne (4308 cells L(-1)), and Kuti (1038 10 cells L-1) showed no significant differences. Bacillariophyceae and Cyanophyceae mostly dominated phytoplankton cell density. The most abundant (> 10(5) cells L-1) taxa, Microcystis aeruginosa, M. wesenbergii and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, were found in Lake Kuti during summer. Six taxa were recorded for the first time in Croatia: Cyclotella striata, Botryococcus braunii, Pediastrum sturmii, Desmidium swartzii, Chamaesiphon cylindricus, and Woronichinia naegeliana.

In one experiment, size-selectivity of 16- to 21-mm mussels was assessed for a single M.aeruginosa clone across a wide size range (similar to 5-88m median equivalent diameter, ED). Consumption of colonies 80m median ED (109m median maximum linear dimension) was undetectable, indicating a size threshold of grazing invulnerability. Smaller colonies and single cells were consumed at rates similar to a highly palatable alga (Ankistrodesmus). In a second experiment, the size-selectivity of three size classes of mussels (8-11, 17-20 and 25-28mm shell length) was assessed across three size classes of M.aeruginosa (similar to 32-75m median ED). There were no systematic differences in the abilities of the different mussel size classes to consume the largest colonies within this size range. An 8-year field survey of the M.aeruginosa population in Gull Lake, MI (U.S.A.), the source of the experimental organisms, revealed that median colony size consistently decreased during each summer, from above to below the size threshold of effective mussel feeding we identified, which suggests major within-season shifts in the overall vulnerability of the M.aeruginosa population to mussel grazing. Variation in the size structure of M.aeruginosa may help explain highly variable effects of D.polymorpha on the dynamics of this harmful phytoplankter within and across systems.

J	LEMMIN, U; IMBODEN, DM				LEMMIN, U; IMBODEN, DM			DYNAMICS OF BOTTOM CURRENTS IN A SMALL LAKE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The dynamics of bottom currents in Baldeggersee, Switzerland, were investigated with a specially designed recording current meter sensitive to current velocities of 0.3-2.5 cm s-1. Supporting information was obtained from thermistor-chain temperature recordings and from records of atmospheric boundary-layer parameters measured in the center of the lake. During 1980-1981 bottom currents recorded for 1-week-periods on the central bottom plateau of the lake (65-m water depth) were highly variable. The mean speed was slightly > 1 cm s-1 with no seasonal trend. Speeds > 2.5 cm s-1 occurred after periods of high wind; quiescent periods were rare and seldom lasted more than 1 h. Spectral analysis shows that the primary mechanism generating bottom currents during stratification is internal gravity waves in the thermocline. During winter mixing when chemical stratification is observed below 30 m, the wind stress distribution is directly reflected in the bottom current pattern. In both periods wind-induced disturbances were felt in the bottom layer with little time delay, indicating the event-dominated structure of bottom current dynamics. Bursts of particle transport in the bottom layer are observed during periods of high wind, suggesting episodic particle resuspensions. Such events may be important for the control of mass exchange at the sediment-water interface.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	1987	32	1					62	75		10.4319/lo.1987.32.1.0062	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1987.32.1.0062													WOS:A1987G107200005
J	Müller, C				Mueller, Carolina			Bi-decadal climate reconstruction derived from a 1200-year long pollen record from the NE Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and its implications for discussion of the late Holocene environmental dynamics	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												This study presents bi-decadal scale pollen record of climate change from the Daotang Pond (36 degrees 57'35.4 N, 100 degrees 74'48.4 E; 3205 m a.s.l.). The pollen record situated 2 km southeast of Lake Qinghai in the north-eastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) reveals a pattern of consequent changes in the alpine meadow and steppe vegetation throughout the last 1200 years. Due to its location at the interface of the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) and the North Atlantic Westerlies, the Daotang record reacts sensitively even to minor changes in precipitation. Consequently, impact of both these major atmospheric circulation systems on the regional environments can be analysed and discussed along with the other climatic proxies from the region. The EASM impact was generally strong throughout the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), which lasted from the beginning of the record at 850 CE up to roughly 1400 CE. This time interval was characterised by a favourable warm and rather moist climate with a precipitation peak around 950 CE. However, two dry spells indicating irregular EASM weakening occurred around 1050-1150 CE and 1250-1400 CE. Westerlies dominated the atmospheric circulation during the Little Ice Age (LIA). This cold phase started around 1450 CE and lasted roughly until 1950 CE. It was characterised by a drier regional climate compared to the humid MWP, though lower evaporation due to decreased summer temperatures helped in keeping locally wet environment at the study site. Three dry and cold intervals are detected in the Daotang record at 1450-1550 CE, 1650-1700 CE and 1800-1850 CE, based on an exceptionally low Artemisia/Chenopodiaceae (A/C) pollen ratio and a generally low pollen concentration. After 1950 CE a shift towards a warmer and wetter climate occurred interrupted by a pronounced dry spell during the recent years. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Evaluated against several years of baseline data, the initial biological impact of the project on fish populations, mostly whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) and crisco (C. artedii), appeared to be relatively small. Fishing activity in the lower river and the estuary largely ceased from 1979 to 1981, due to physical modifications of traditional fishing areas and other social and economic effects related to the hydro project. Some fishermen modified their methods and continued harvesting in the affected area, but others abandoned the affected area and fished lakes and rivers along the recently constructed road network. Earlier impact assessments fell short of predicting these impacts.																			0004-0843	1923-1245					1982	35	4					524	530																WOS:A1982PX59900007

Demonstration of Spiral Wavefront Navigation on an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle	IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING												Experiments carried out at NUWC's Seneca Lake facility in the summer of 2020 demonstrate the efficacy of underwater navigation via a single spiral wavefront (SWF) acoustic beacon. An SWF beacon is a transducer array that has the capability of generating a spiral acoustic signal whose phase varies linearly with angular aspect along with a reference signal with constant phase. An unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) operating in Seneca Lake under various channel conditions receives a regular signal from a fixed position single SWF beacon. The UUV's aspect relative to the beacon and its radial velocity can be determined by comparing the phase of the spiral signal to that of the reference signal. The SWF navigation solutions are compared to the UUVs inertial/GPS navigation. Advances in signal processing for the spiral wavefront navigation in multipath environments are detailed.

Previous studies inferred a polar jet stream south of 35 degrees N at 18 ka and at similar to 40 degrees N at 17-14 ka. Highstand sediments of Harper Lake, the upstream-most pluvial lake along the Mojave River, have yielded uncalibrated radiocarbon ages ranging from 24,000 to >30,000 C-14 yr BP. Based on geologic mapping, radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence dating, we infer a similar to 45-40 ka age for the Harper Lake highstand sediments. Combining the Harper Lake highstand with other Great Basin pluvial lake/spring and marine climate records, we infer that the North American polar jet stream was south of 35 degrees N about 45-40 ka, but shifted to 40 degrees N by similar to 35 ka. Ostracodes (Limnocythere ceriotuberosa) from Harper Lake highstand sediments are consistent with an alkaline lake environment that received seasonal inflow from the Mojave River, thus confirming the lake was fed by the Mojave River. The similar to 45-40 ka highstand at Harper Lake coincides with a shallowing interval at downstream Lake Manic. (c) 2013 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Murfitt, J; Duguay, CR				Murfitt, Justin; Duguay, Claude R.			50 years of lake ice research from active microwave remote sensing: Progress and prospects	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Lake ice is an important feature of the physical landscape at northern latitudes. Not only does the presence of lake ice help modulate weather and climate but it also plays an important role in travel between northern communities. Furthermore, the thickness of ice cover can impact overwintering fish habitat and access to fresh water during winter months. Lake ice cover and lake ice thickness are two notable climate proxies identified by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) as Essential Climate Variables (ECVs). Changes in ice thickness can impact lakes freezing to bed which in turn affect permafrost thaw while longer periods of open water can impact heat transfer to the atmosphere. With recent climate warming in the Northern Hemisphere, there are general trends towards thinner ice and an increase in the length of the open water season. However, the paucity of in-situ observations in many countries has led to remote sensing playing an ever-increasing role for lake ice monitoring. This paper reviews progress in lake ice research conducted using active microwave remote sensing over the last 50 years and highlights areas where future developments are needed. Analysis of the literature found that the diversity of study areas where this work is taking place has increased, incorporating more lake sites from the midlatitudes in North America, Europe, and Asia. Additionally, clear connections can be made between the launch of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites and patterns in the use of certain radar frequencies in scientific studies. This review also discusses evolving theories concerning the scattering mechanisms associated with lake ice as well as the current state of lake ice cover and ice thickness retrieval methods. The paper concludes with a suite of recommendations for future research, highlighting work that is needed on: 1) advancing our understanding of the response of active microwave signals to lake ice properties; 2) applying machine learning algorithms to lake ice classification; 3) further exploring the retrieval of ice thickness from imaging SAR and radar altimetry data; and 4) other considerations such as data availability and the topic of snow on lake ice.					; Duguay, Claude/G-5682-2011	Duguay, Claude/0000-0002-1044-5850; 													0034-4257	1879-0704				OCT	2021	264								112616	10.1016/j.rse.2021.112616	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2021.112616		JUL 2021											WOS:000688280500001

Dragonfly assemblages in four Mediterranean wetlands of Samos Island, Greece (Odonata)	FRAGMENTA ENTOMOLOGICA												Dragonflies (Odonata) are considered to be valuable indicators of hydroecosystems. This study reports the composition of the dragonfly assemblages in four wetlands of Samos Island, Greece, in a geographic area especially vulnerable to climate change where a trend towards a drier climate has been observed in the last decades. Dragonfly assemblages have not yet been studied on Samos. The analysis based on the number of different species and their autochthony revealed clear differences among the wetlands. The eutrophic Glyfada Lake, despite its variable hydrology resulting from drought - the seasonal decrease in water availability - harboured the largest diversity of dragonflies, larger than the oligotrophic Mesokampos Lake. The assemblage of the spring and rivulet at Mytilini, although also influenced by drought, had its own set of species of high autochthony. The seasonal brackish lake and marsh of Psili Ammos had the lowest number of species and was dominated by one very abundant breeding species. Drought was the main factor affecting the number and composition of species. The collected data create a reference for the future monitoring of trends in the composition of odonatofauna under the changing climate of Samos Island.						Taylor, Jan R.

Recent observations of increases in aquatic primary production near the main development area have prompted questions about the principal drivers of these limnological changes. Is the enhanced primary production due to deposition of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) from local industry or from recent climatic changes? Here, we use downcore, spectrally-inferred chlorophyll-a (VRS-chla) profiles (including diagenetic products) from 23 limnologically-diverse lakes with undisturbed catchments to characterize the pattern of primary production increases in the AOSR. Our aim is to better understand the relative roles of the local oil sands industry versus climate change in driving aquatic primary production trends. Nutrient deposition maps, generated using geostatistical interpolations of spring-time snowpack measurements from a grid pattern across the AOSR, demonstrate patterns of elevated total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and bioavailable nitrogen deposition around the main area of industrial activity. However, this pattern is not observed for bioavailable phosphorus. Our paleolimnological findings demonstrate consistently greater VRS-chla concentrations compared to pre-oil sands development levels, regardless of morphological and limnological characteristics, landscape position, bioavailable nutrient deposition, and dibenzothiophene (DBT)-inferred industrial impacts. Furthermore, breakpoint analyses on VRS-chla concentrations across a gradient of DBT-inferred industrial impact show limited evidence of a contemporaneous change among lakes. Despite the contribution of bioavailable nitrogen to the landscape from industrial activities, we find no consistency in the spatial pattern and timing of VRS-chla shifts with an industrial fertilizing signal. Instead, significant positive correlations were observed between VRS-chla and annual and seasonal temperatures. Our findings suggest warmer air temperatures and likely decreased ice covers are important drivers of enhanced aquatic primary production across the AOSR.

J	Clegg, BF; Hu, FS				Clegg, Benjamin F.; Hu, Feng Sheng			An oxygen-isotope record of Holocene climate change in the south-central Brooks Range, Alaska	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Understanding the ecological and socio-economic impacts of climatic warming requires knowledge of associated changes in moisture balance. Reconstructions of Holocene moisture-balance variation offer indispensible baseline information against which recent changes can be evaluated. We analyzed Chara-stem encrustations in the sediments of Takahula Lake, located in the south-central Brooks Range of Alaska, for oxygen and carbon-isotope composition to infer climatic change over the past 8000 years To help constrain climatic interpretations of the sediment delta O-18 record, we also analyzed water samples from Takahula and other lakes in the region for oxygen and hydrogen isotope composition. Results show that winter precipitation dominates the water balance of these lakes and that post-input evaporation is a key control of lake-water isotope composition of Takahula Lake Stratigraphic patterns in Chara-delta O-18, supplemented by those in delta C-18 and sediment lithology, reveal distinct changes in effective moisture (precipitation minus evaporation) over the past 8000 years Effective moisture was relatively high from 8000 to 5000 cal BP, with marked fluctuations between 6800 and 5000 cal BP. It then decreased to reach a minimum around 4000 cal BP and increased with fluctuations from 4000 to similar to 2500 cal BP, followed by a decreasing trend toward the present that was interrupted by a wet Little Ice Age (centered at 400 cal BP) Aridity during the 20th century was among the highest of the entire 8000-year record At the millennial timescale, the temporal patterns of moisture-balance shifts at Takahula Lake are broadly coherent with those inferred from previous paleoclimate records from the region The Chara-delta O-18 values around 5600 cal BP and during the Little Ice Age are up to 5 parts per thousand lower than at present and 3 6 parts per thousand, lower than that of the modern input-water to the lake These exceptionally low values suggest that factors other than effective moisture must have contributed to the pronounced variations in the Takahula lake delta O-18 record. Increased winter precipitation associated with a westerly Aleutian Low position may account for 1 parts per thousand of the delta O-18 decrease. Other factors leading to the O-18-depletion during these periods probably include decreased temperatures, as well as increased lake-Ice cover and associated reductions in evaporation (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Team Crawford	The varved succession of Crawford Lake, Milton, Ontario, Canada as a candidate Global boundary Stratotype Section and Point for the Anthropocene series	ANTHROPOCENE REVIEW												An annually laminated succession in Crawford Lake, Ontario, Canada is proposed as the Global boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the Anthropocene as a series/epoch with a base dated at 1950 CE. Varve couplets of organic matter capped by calcite precipitated each summer in alkaline surface waters reflect environmental change at global to local scales. Spheroidal carbonaceous particles and nitrogen isotopes record an increase in fossil fuel combustion in the early 1950s, coinciding with fallout from nuclear and thermonuclear testing-Pu239+240 and C-14:C-12, the latter more than compensating for the effects of old carbon in this dolomitic basin. Rapid industrial expansion in the North American Great Lakes region led to enhanced leaching of terrigenous elements by acid precipitation during the Great Acceleration, and calcite precipitation was reduced, producing thin calcite laminae around the GSSP that is marked by a sharp decline in elm pollen (Dutch Elm disease). The lack of bioturbation in well-oxygenated bottom waters, supported by the absence of fossil pigments from obligately anaerobic purple sulfur bacteria, is attributed to elevated salinities and high alkalinity below the chemocline. This aerobic depositional environment, unusual in a meromictic lake, inhibits the mobilization of Pu-239, the proposed primary stratigraphic guide for the Anthropocene.					; Hajdas, Irka/C-6696-2011; Leavitt, Peter/A-1048-2013; Cundy, Andy/AAE-3234-2020; Rose, Neil/C-5739-2008; Finkelstein, Sarah/K-8202-2012	Nasser, Nawaf/0000-0001-9057-3248; Milton, James/0000-0003-4245-5532; Rose, Neil/0000-0002-5697-7334; Leavitt, Peter/0000-0001-9805-9307; Lafond, Krysten M./0009-0003-2524-9427; Cundy, Andy/0000-0003-4368-2569; Riddick, Nicholas/0009-0005-1370-6365													2053-0196	2053-020X				APR	2023	10	1			SI		146	176		10.1177/20530196221149281	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/20530196221149281		FEB 2023						37255737					WOS:000935935100001

These networks consist of a dual-pipe system connected to decentralized heat pumps that serve the heating or cooling needs, and to borehole storages that even out seasonal mismatch between the demands for heating and cooling. The software Polysun has been modified for the simulation of LTDHC networks, and models have been validated with measured data from an existing network in Zurich. Simplified simulation cases were used to analyze the potential for direct or "free" cooling by LTDHC networks. Our results show that "free" cooling of residential buildings can only contribute to a minor extent to the regeneration of borehole field storages connected to LTDHC. Therefore, other sources such as waste heat or solar thermal energy are needed to fully regenerate the borehole fields in order to avoid long-term freezing of the heat carrier fluid. These sources induce elevated temperatures in the network/borehole storage in summer and thereby further limit possible contributions of direct cooling. Deep lake water has an elevated potential for direct cooling of buildings. The potential of superficial water may be largely overestimated when using standard (artificial) weather data for the determination of the thermal building loads in combination with measured water temperatures. For realistic results, the water temperatures must correlate with the weather data. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This led to the tidal intrusion of saline water from Richards Bay into the Mzingazi River. The extent of the intrusion up the river and into the groundwater was determined and the impact on the adjacent flora recorded. Results showed that saline water penetrated the groundwater for up to 20 m from the river bank and that this had caused the death of a number of swamp forest trees as well as the defoliation of others. Spring tides and particularly a very high equinox tide further aggravated the situation causing damage to and the death of, numerous plants in herbaceous swamp areas.																			0378-4738					JAN	1997	23	1					101	108																WOS:A1997WF25100013

The pronounced thermal stratification with the depth of the thermocline determined by the top height of the underwater dam (4,8 m below surface) resulted in epilimnetic inflow and hydraulic short circuit between inlet and main basin of the reservoir in summer. A simple model was developed for the approximation of nutrient elimination. Epilimnetic nitrate was used as a quasi-conservative discharge tracer. Compared with a ''normal'' pre-dam of the same size, the estimated mean phosphorus elimination of less than about 20 % in UWHA was low.

The diatom record of a 10m core collected from beneath 66m of water at an offshore station extends the known history of the lake 10,000 years beyond the published records from Pilkington Bay and Damba Channel, and shows the maximal late Pleistocene aridity occurred between 15,000 and 13,000 BP. Lake of precipitated carbonates in the offshore sediments suggests that the lake remained relatively dilute throughout the period of record. 3.

Vulture, a volcano in Southern Italy	TERRA NOVA												Geochemical investigations have shown that there is a considerable inflow of gas into both crater lakes of Monticchio, Southern Italy. These lakes are located in two maars that formed 140 000 years ago during Mt. Vulture volcano's last eruptive activity. Isotopic analyses suggest that CO2 and helium are of magmatic origin; the latter displays He-3/He-4 isotope ratios similar to those measured in olivines of the maar ejecta. In spite of the fact that the amount of dissolved gases in the water is less than that found in Lake Nyos (Cameroon), both the results obtained and the historical reports studied indicate that these crater lakes could be highly hazardous sites, even though they are located in a region currently considered inactive. This could be of special significance in very popular tourist areas such as the Monticchio lakes, which are visited by about 30 000 people throughout the summer, for the most part on Sundays.

An archaeological feature discovered recently at Kiekrz (western Poland) has provided us with a rare opportunity to conduct complex research on a representative and large sample. Our study aimed to recognise the function of the pit, the character of the shell deposit, its chronology, the season of shell collection and environmental conditions that prevailed in the settlement's time. The investigations included multi-faceted analyses of archaeological finds (pottery, animal bones, and mollusc shells) and charcoal remains, delta C-13 and delta O-18 shell composition, and C14 dating. The results of the research indicate that the molluscs of Unio were deliberately collected for food c. 1500 cal. BC. They were probably harvested during late summer from the nearby lake. Then the molluscs were steamed in a kind of earth oven. Pine and oak wood from the immediate vicinity was used as firewood during the molluscs processing. After the meal, shells were probably stored in the pit for further use.

Turtles were captured using unbaited fyke nets. Stomach contents were flushed from Podocnemis unifilis (N = 351), Podocnemis expansa (N = 3), Phrynops geoffroanus (N = 31), Phrynops raniceps (N = 5), and Chelus fimbriatus (N = 5). We found no seasonal differences in food consumed by P. unifilis; however, differences were found between the sexes. Females consumed more seeds and fruits, whereas males consumed more shoots and stems. Consumption of seeds and fruits increased linearly as a function of the mean carapace length of P. unifilis, whereas the consumption of fish eaten decreased with increase in mean CL. Seeds and fruits were consumed at higher frequency and volume in flooded forest than in lakes and rivers. We found no difference in types of food consumed between habitats or sexes in P. geoffroanus. Adult Gerridae, Libellulidae larvae, and crustaceans of the family Palaemonidae occurred in high numbers in the stomach contents of P. geoffroanus when water levels were falling, whereas only fruits of Myrtaceae and Sapotaceae were found during the season of rising water levels. Podocnemis expansa consumed primarily plant material, and P. raniceps fed predominantly on Gastropods. Chelus fed on the fish Creninichia (Cichlidae) and Triportheus (Characidae).																			0022-1511					DEC	1995	29	4					536	547		10.2307/1564736	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1564736													WOS:A1995TK75800005
J	Wilson, AE; Sarnelle, O				Wilson, AE; Sarnelle, O			Relationship between zebra mussel biomass and total phosphorus in European and North American lakes	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												We developed a regression model for predicting zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) biomass from summer epilimnetic total phosphorus (TP) using published data from Polish lakes: dry tissue biomass = -10.8 + 11.0 log(10)TP, R-2 = 0.19, P<0.04, N = 24. This model was used to predict Dreissena biomass in six recently-invaded North American lakes. All of the North American observations fit within the 95 % confidence limits of the Polish lake relationship. The predictive relationship for the combined Polish and North American data, dry tissue biomass = -7.1 + 9.0 log(10)TP, R-2 = 0.24, P = 0.007, N = 30, should be useful as a necessary first step for predicting zebra mussel impacts, as well as for estimating reasonable stocking densities of zebra mussels for in situ experiments.

Obsidian chips and glass spheres typically crack when quenched. Vesicular pyroclasts are made of glass, so thermal quenching by water may damage them. If water enters eruption columns, or if pyroclastic density currents interact with water, hot pumice can be quenched. We performed a set of experiments on air fall pumice from Medicine Lake, California. We made quenched samples by heating natural clasts to 600 degrees C, quenching them in water at 21 degrees C, drying them at 105 degrees C, and then cooling them to room temperature. We compare these samples with untreated air fall pumice from the same deposit, hereafter referred to as regular pumice. We tested whether quenched pumice would 1) shatter more easily in collisions and 2) abrade faster. We also tested whether individual clasts lose mass upon quenching, and whether they increase in effective wet density, two measurements which may help characterize the magnitude of clast damage during quenching. We also compare pre-quenching and post-quenching textures using X-ray microtomography (mu XRT) images. Results from collision experiments show no clear difference between quenched pumice and regular pumice. Quenched pumice abraded faster than regular pumice. On average 0.3% of mass may have been lost during quenching. Effective wet density increased 1.5% on average, as measured after 5 minutes of immersion in water. Overall, we find modest differences between quenched pumice and regular pumice in experiments and measurements. The experimental results imply that quenching may damage small parts of a clast but tends not to cause cracks that propagate easily through the clast. Post-quenching mu XRT imaging shows no obvious change in clast texture. This is in stark contrast to non-vesicular glass that develops large cracks on quenching. We present four factors that explain why pumice is resistant to damage from thermal quenching: thin glass films experience lower transient thermal stresses, many internal surfaces are initially vapor cooled, vesicles can arrest cracks, and cracks from thermal quenching may not occur in the locations most susceptible to fracture in later collisions.

The relatively flat landscape and the associated regional groundwater systems with their concomitantly low hydraulic gradients create a setting in which is developed a clearer than normal aerial separation of a wide range of complex interwoven physico-chemical processes. Detailed work in the Tyrrell Basin over a number of years has enabled the establishment of a hydrogeological framework which forms the basis for unravelling otherwise complicated hydrochemical interactions between groundwater systems and salt lakes. Indeed, the interactions between groundwater flow systems and the regional groundwater discharge landscape in general, and the spring zones of salt lakes in particular, have important implications, bearing upon the solution, migration, deposition and concentration of salts and metals by regional groundwater systems in arid and semi-arid areas.																			0009-2541					MAR 5	1992	96	1-2					1	18		10.1016/0009-2541(92)90118-O	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0009-2541(92)90118-O													WOS:A1992HN07100002

J	Caulkett, AP; EllisEvans, JC				Caulkett, AP; EllisEvans, JC			Origin and composition of settling iron aggregates in oligotrophic Sombre lake, Signy island, Antarctica	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Sediment traps were deployed in an oligotrophic, seasonally anoxic maritime Antarctic lake for 15 months. Immediately after the onset of the inflow in spring many iron oxyhydroxide aggregates were collected in the traps. Image analysis, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis were used to examine the aggregates. The aggregates consisted of primary particles that persisted in the aggregates. The mean diameter of the aggregates was constant with depth. The aggregates consisted predominantly of iron, phosphorus and oxygen but calcium was also an important constituent. Significant concentrations of manganese and sodium were also detected. The molar ratio Fe:P remained constant at 4:1 as did the ratio Fe:Ca at 52:1. The concentration of iron, phosphorus and calcium in the aggregates increased with depth, whilst the concentration of manganese decreased with depth in parallel with a gradient of increasing anoxia. The stable water column formed under ice cover and the temporal and spatial data provide evidence that the Fe:P and Fe:Ca ratios are constant and characteristic of the aggregates, whilst the overall composition of the aggregates is more dynamic and dependant on redox conditions and water chemistry.																			0018-8158					SEP 13	1996	330	3					177	187		10.1007/BF00024206	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00024206													WOS:A1996VP18400002

WATER BALANCES OF TWO PIEDMONT HEADWATER CATCHMENTS: IMPLICATIONS FOR REGIONAL HYDROLOGIC LANDSCAPE CLASSIFICATION	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												In the Piedmont of North Carolina, a traditionally water-rich region, reservoirs that serve over 1 million people are under increasing pressure due to naturally occurring droughts and increasing land development. Innovative development approaches aim to maintain hydrologic conditions of the undisturbed landscape, but are based on insufficient target information. This study uses the hydrologic landscape concept to evaluate reference hydrology in small headwater catchments surrounding Falls Lake, a reservoir serving Raleigh and the greater Triangle area. Researchers collected one year of detailed data on water balance components, including precipitation, evapotranspiration, streamflow, and shallow subsurface storage from two headwater catchments representative of two hydrologic landscapes defined by differences in soils and topographic characteristics. The two catchments are similar in size and lie within the same physiographic region, and during the study period they showed similar water balances of 26-30% Q, -4 to 5% Delta S, 59-65% evapotranspiration, and 9-10% G. However, the steeper, more elevated catchment exhibited perennial streamflow and nongrowing season runoff ratios (Q/P) of 33%, whereas the flat, low-lying stream was drier during the growing season and exhibited Q/P ratios of 52% during the nongrowing season. A hydrologic landscape defined by topography and soil characteristics helps characterize local-scale reference hydrology and may contribute to better land management decisions.					; James, April/D-1415-2012	James, April Lynda/0000-0002-1741-5101; 													1093-474X	1752-1688				AUG	2014	50	4					1063	1079		10.1111/jawr.12173	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jawr.12173													WOS:000340464800016

Taxonomic differences in the essential fatty acid composition of groups of freshwater zooplankton relate to reproductive demands and generation time	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Marked differences were observed in the total fatty acid concentrations and essential fatty acid (EFA) distributions of co-existing freshwater copepods and cladocerans in four large lake systems (lakes Michigan, Erie, Ontario and Champlain) over two growing seasons. These patterns appeared independent of lake seston EFA composition. 2. Compared to the cladocerans, calanoid and cyclopoid copepods contained significantly higher concentrations of total fatty acids and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an EFA abundant in fish. Calanoids and cladocerans contained similar levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), but cladocerans showed EPA : DHA ratios consistently greater than those of the available seston food source. Alpha-linolenic acid was most abundant in the herbivorous cladocerans, Daphnia and Holopedium, while the highest concentrations of arachidonic acid were found in the predatory cladocerans, Bythotrephes longimanus and Leptodora kindtii. 3. The distinct EFA accumulation patterns between cladoceran and copepod zooplankton suggest metabolic regulation of certain EFAs to meet the particular physiological demands and ecological strategies of these different zooplankton groups. Cladocerans may accumulate EPA directly from their diet, or through transformation of dietary materials to facilitate rapid somatic growth and enhance reproduction due to their short generation time. In contrast, copepods may retain DHA to increase their cell membrane fluidity in order to remain active over the winter due to their longer generation time and life cycle. 4. Consistent EFA differences between zooplankton groups may have implications regarding the somatic growth and reproductive success of different zooplankton taxa as well as the nutritional value of various zooplankton groups for larval and planktivorous fish.

Alaska. At Barrow, on the coast of the Arctic Ocean, 60% of the lakes freeze completely to the bottom in mid-January alone and by the end of winter 77% of the lakes are completely frozen to the bottom. In contrast, 100 km to the south in the 'B' Lakes region, only 23% of the lakes freeze completely to the bottom and there is no sudden freezing of many lakes as occurs at Barrow. A physically based, numerical model is used to simulate ice growth on the lakes. The simulated maximum ice thickness is 2.2 m. Any lake where some part of the ice cover does not freeze to the bottom thus has some water > 2.2 m deep. For those lakes where the ice cover froze completely at some time in the winter, the simulated ice growth curve provides the ice thickness at the time each lake froze completely to the bottom and thus maximum water depth. At Barrow, 60% of the lakes are up to 1.4 m/1.5 m deep and 25% are > 2.2 m deep. At the 'B' Lakes, 75% of the lakes are > 2.2 m deep. Thus, there is a considerable contrast in lake depth and water availability between the Barrow and the 'B' Lakes regions. This method is simple to implement, and the SAR data are relatively inexpensive and have sufficient spatial and temporal coverage; thus it could be used to determine lake depth and water availability on the entire North Slope and in other polar and sub-polar areas where shallow lakes are common.																					0-7844-0190-X				1996							855	865																WOS:A1996BG81P00072

A.; McAllen, Rob; Davenport, John; Regan, Fiona			High resolution monitoring of episodic stratification events in an enclosed marine system	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												While hypoxic and anoxic environments have existed throughout geological time, their frequency of occurrence in shallow coastal and estuarine areas appears to be increasing. However, few data are available on the physicochemical conditions at the boundary between anoxic and normoxic layers, including the conditions required for both formation and dissipation of stratification. Advances in autonomous environmental sensing technology have produced robust sensors capable of detailed measurements under inhospitable conditions created in such environments. In this study, an autonomous sensor approach was used to compare water column properties above and below the stratification before during and after dissipation of the stratification. Further, an investigation into the effect of the stratification on sedimentation rates of organic and inorganic matter and current speeds is reported here. Lough Hyne, a seasonally stratified temperate marine lake provided favourable conditions for this study. It was shown that temperatures dropped rapidly above the oxy-thermocline while increasing rapidly below the stratification, leading to a mixing of the complete water column. This was reflected in oxygen measurements below the stratification, which rose from anoxia to normoxic conditions over the same time period. During summer, the thermocline formed a barrier to organic matter sedimentation, reducing it significantly when present, while inorganic matter sedimentation was unaffected by the presence of thermocline. It also caused a reduction in current speeds below the thermocline. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Least Cost Paths and Movement in Tonto Basin, Central Arizona	KIVA-JOURNAL OF SOUTHWESTERN ANTHROPOLOGY AND HISTORY												Perched high above Roosevelt Lake in Tonto Basin, central Arizona, the Upper and Lower Tonto Cliff Dwellings have been commonly excluded from archaeological narratives for the basin. Although one of the few sizeable settlements inhabited in Tonto Basin during the Gila phase (A.D. 1350-1450), the cliff dwellings fell outside the boundaries of several large cultural resource management projects, and are a settlement type atypical for the basin. A disconnect between studies of the Tonto Cliff Dwellings and the rest of the basin therefore exists. Least cost paths (LCPs) are therefore calculated from the Tonto Cliff Dwellings to settlements around Arizona to identify and contextualize possible travel routes between Tonto Basin and beyond. It is argued that reconstructing and refining travel in the ancient Southwest requires the creation of multiple LCPs among multiple start and end points, verification through artifact and feature documentation, and insights from traditional knowledge.

J	BELL, RT				BELL, RT			AN EXPLANATION FOR THE VARIABILITY IN THE CONVERSION FACTOR DERIVING BACTERIAL-CELL PRODUCTION FROM INCORPORATION OF [H-3] THYMIDINE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The empirical conversion factor deriving bacterial cell production from incorporation of [3H]thymidine (cells nmol-1) varies by orders of magnitude in the literature. An empirical conversion factor is not realistic unless the concentration of [3H]thymidine used maximizes the degree of participation (DP) of [3H]thymidine in DNA synthesis equally in both unaltered lake-water samples and in lake-water cultures. I find that a higher [3H]thymidine concentration (> 20 nM) than normally used for routine samples (5-10 nM) may be required for maximal incorporation into DNA in lake-water cultures, at least in spring. Thus a conversion factor with the latter [3H]thymidine concentrations will be an overestimate. This hypothesis is supported by an analysis of the literature indicating that with concentrations of [3H]thymidine > 10 nM, the empirical conversion factors most often approach the expected theoretical factor (.apprxeq. 1 .times. 1018 cells mol-1).																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JUN	1990	35	4					910	915		10.4319/lo.1990.35.4.0910	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1990.35.4.0910													WOS:A1990EB16800011

In Slovakia, its occurrence remained unconfirmed for over 60 years and it was therefore considered extinct. The paper reports its rediscovery on two sites in SE Slovakia. Both localities were found in the Latorica River catchment area in 2015 when persistent summer droughts enabled the development of natural mudflat vegetation in the dried oxbows. Confirmation of this historic site indicates the long-term survival ability of the species. We assigned L. palustris dominated vegetation in the class Isoeto-Nanojuncetea, association Ludwigio palustris-Lindernietum pro-cumbentis.

Climatic and environmental variability during the termination of the Last Glacial Stage in coastal eastern Australia: a review	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												By comparison with the Northern Hemisphere, there is a paucity of high-resolution, continuous records extending into the Last Glacial Maximum from the Southern Hemisphere. With specific reference to coastal eastern Australia, there are long records of paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental variability available from the tropical north and temperate south. However, there are significant spatial gaps between such records: in particular, until relatively recently, little attention had been paid to the subtropics. This review paper summarises understanding of regional paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic variability in coastal eastern Australia during the termination of the Last Glacial Stage, with the aim of highlighting gaps in the current state of knowledge. Recommendations for future research are prioritised to answer knowledge gaps in understanding climate variability in eastern Australia between ca 33-18 kyr BP.

We combined 4 months of acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) data with sea-level, temperature, and wind time series to analyze the dynamics of low-frequency (periods > 1 day) internal oscillations in the fjord. Additionally, seasonal conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) data from 19 along-fjord stations were used to characterize the seasonality of the density field. The density profiles were used to estimate the internal long-wave phase speed (c) using two approximations: (1) a simple reduced gravity model (RGM) and (2) a continuously stratified model (CSM). No major seasonal changes in c were observed using either approximation (e.g., the CSM yielded 0.73 < c < 0.87 ms(-1) for mode 1). The natural internal periods (T-N) were estimated using Merian's formula for a simple fjord-like basin and the above phase speeds. Estimated values of T-N varied between 2.9 and 3.5 days and were highly consistent with spectral peaks observed in the along-fjord currents and temperature time series. We conclude that these oscillations were forced by the wind stress, despite the moderate wind energy. Wind conditions at the end of winter gave us an excellent opportunity to explore the damping process. The observed damping time (T-d) was relatively long (T-d = 9.1 days).					; Pizarro, Oscar/LXA-3275-2024; Castillo, Manuel/L-4604-2016	Ramirez, Nadin/0000-0003-3969-4321; Pizarro, Oscar/0000-0001-7987-6555; Castillo, Manuel/0000-0003-3984-8837; Caceres, Mario Arturo/0000-0002-0819-049X													1812-0784					FEB 17	2017	13	1					145	160		10.5194/os-13-145-2017	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/os-13-145-2017													WOS:000395183500001

The traces comprise networks of near-surface, fragile, unlined, tubular burrows, 2-4 mm in diameter. In places these merge into 1-2 mm wide, irregular surface trails. This paper is believed to be the first descriptive account of lebensspuren made by Gammarus, fossil forms of which may possibly be preserved in rocks dating back to the Eocene. Although several species of Gammarus are tolerant of saline waters it is suggested that the traces may, in association with other lines of evidence, be of use in the interpretation of depositional environments.

Calcareous varves appear as rhythmic units of light-colored carbonate and dark-colored biogenic-clastic lamina in the sediment. The light-colored carbonate layers are formed in the dry season due to strong evaporation and Spirulina blooms. The varved sequence provides a high-resolution geochemical archive of paleoclimatic variability in this tropical, data sparse area. A synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence method was used to analyze elemental data at seasonal to annual time scales. In this arid region, elemental Ca and Sr are mainly regulated by the balance of evaporation and precipitation in this closed lake basin. The elemental variations show distinct interannual and decadal variabilities. On interannual time scales, spectral analysis of the Ca and Sr time series indicates stronger El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-like (Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)-like) variability at periods of 2-7 years. It may suggest that ENSO and/or IOD are two dominant modes of regional rainfall variability on interannual time scales over the past 530 years. The quasiperiodicities of approximately 10 years suggest that solar activity may be a critical driving force of monsoonal rainfall in the region. A notable feature is that decreasing monsoonal rainfall since A. D. 1840 is coupled with tropical sea surface temperature variation. Considering that the monsoonal rainfall is coupled with several atmospheric processes evolving at different spatial and temporal scales, more high-resolution data are required to evaluate and verify the regional rainfall variability and its dynamic links.

We quantified the abundance of heterotrophic bacteria, autotrophic picoplankton (APP), nanoflagellates (NF) and ciliates in Lake Vesijarvi throughout the water column and vegetation season and determined how these varied with changes in environmental conditions, including dissolved oxygen concentrations. The abundance and diversity of ciliates increased significantly throughout the water column with the development of thermal stratification and the onset of hypoxia leading to distinct ciliate communities in the oxic epilimnion and hypoxic hypolimnion. Bacterivorous taxa dominated in the hypoxic zone, while in the epilimnion, bacterivorous, algivorous and predatory taxa feeding on other protozoa were present. Seasonal changes in oxygen and temperature explained nearly 80% of variance in ciliate community composition. Changes in total ciliate numbers correlated with seasonal dynamics of bacteria, but not with the dynamics of NF. In the epilimnion, NF were abundant in early spring and their numbers were positively correlated to numbers of prostomatids and haptorids, but not to APP or bacteria. In the hypolimnion, a significant correlation was found between NF and bacteria, but not NF and ciliates. Significant positive correlations between ciliates and bacteria suggest that concentrations of food resources are important in determining the abundance of ciliates in the plankton. Moreover, we recorded close coupling between seasonal dynamics of bacteria and productivity of phytoplankton, including APP.																			1864-7790	1864-7782					2012	14	2					105	120		10.3354/ab00379	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ab00379													WOS:000299382200001

Smoke from regional wildfires alters lake ecology	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Wildfire smoke often covers areas larger than the burned area, yet the impacts of smoke on nearby aquatic ecosystems are understudied. In the summer of 2018, wildfire smoke covered Castle Lake (California, USA) for 55 days. We quantified the influence of smoke on the lake by comparing the physics, chemistry, productivity, and animal ecology in the prior four years (2014-2017) to the smoke year (2018). Smoke reduced incident ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation by 31% and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) by 11%. Similarly, underwater UV-B and PAR decreased by 65 and 44%, respectively, and lake heat content decreased by 7%. While the nutrient limitation of primary production did not change, shallow production in the offshore habitat increased by 109%, likely due to a release from photoinhibition. In contrast, deep-water, primary production decreased and the deep-water peak in chlorophyll a did not develop, likely due to reduced PAR. Despite the structural changes in primary production, light, and temperature, we observed little significant change in zooplankton biomass, community composition, or migration pattern. Trout were absent from the littoral-benthic habitat during the smoke period. The duration and intensity of smoke influences light regimes, heat content, and productivity, with differing responses to consumers.

Estimates of the major components of Herring Gull annual energy requirements are presented with the intention of providing groundwork for an energetics model. Emphasis is placed on reproductive needs and chick growth. The total annual budget is 9.4 .times. 104 kcal yr-1 for a female juvenile in its first year (June-May) and 9.3 .times. 104 kcal yr-1 for an adult female of mean annual weight 1039 g. 2. Energy requirements of egg-laying are estimated to be about 678 kcal of which 432 kcal is deposited in the eggs. The peak energy demand is 65 kcal day-1, 3 or 4 days prior to laying and first egg, which represents a 20-25% increase in the female''s total requirement. 3. A Gompertz equation for chick growth is presented with regressions relating the water index and energy content change during growth with fresh weight and time. 4. Precise understanding of Herring Gull body constituent changes during the year is lacking, however, regressions for juvenile and adult fat and weight change as functions of temperature are presented. Fat deposition is 5% and 1% of juvenile and adult annual energy budget respectively. 5. Energy cost of feather replacement is estimated to have a maximum of 5 kcal day-1. Total cost is less than 1% of the annual budget. Behavioural mitigation of energy requirements during moult, such as reduced flight time, are not estimated. 6. Two equations proposed by Kendeigh et al. (1977) for the existence metabolism of non-passerine species during summer and winter photoperiods are transformed into a single expression. Existence energy is therefore given as a function of body weight, ambient temperature and photo period. Use of this general equation is strongly supported by experimental data for Herring Gull existence metabolism during the first 100 days after hatching. 7. Foraging costs are estimated to be 0.28 .+-. 0.14 of a Herring Gull''s net metabolizable energy requirement based on an analysis of their time budget during chick feeding and an average flying cost of 20 kcal hr-1. 8. It is estimated that two parents feeding a 3 chick brood each sustain 100 kcal day-1 extra foraging cost for chicks around the time of fledging, bringing their energy expenditure near its maximum capability. Total cost of feeding chicks is 5.8 .times. 103 kcal per adult, 6% of its total annual budget. 9. Courtship feeding is estimated to provide briefly an energy gain for females approximately equivalent to their basal metabolic rate thus reducing their foraging energy requirement. During that time, territorial defense may be the largest energy requirement of males but no information is available. 10. Flight energy requirements during migration are estimated for typical Herring Gulls from the Great Lakes area to have maximums of 106 kcal month-1 during March for adults and 371 kcal month-1 during January for juveniles.																			0373-2266	2213-1175					1986	74	1					1	23																WOS:A1986C050300001
J	Cocquyt, C; Ryken, E				Cocquyt, Christine; Ryken, Els			Two new needle-shaped Nitzschia taxa from a deep East African crater lake	DIATOM RESEARCH												Two new diatoms, Nitzschia fabiennejansseniana Cocquyt & Ryken sp. nov. and Nitzschia pseudoaequalis Cocquyt sp. nov., are described from Lake Challa, a deep crater lake in East Africa, based on light and electron microscopical observations. These Nitzschia species are morphologically similar to other needle-shaped, planktonic Nitzschia present in freshwater lakes of tropical Africa. The differences between the newly described species and related Nitzschia taxa are a combination of the shape of the poles, the number of striae and fibula in 10 mu m, and the presence of a central gap between the fibulae. Nitzschia fabiennejansseniana is common in the plankton of Lake Challa towards the end of the main dry and windy season during the northern hemisphere summer, when deep water-column mixing causes upwelling of nutrient-rich hypolimnetic water. Together with Afrocymbella barkeri, this taxon is the dominant diatom in the pelagic phytoplankton of Lake Challa today, and has been continuously over at least the last several hundreds of years, as recorded in its sediments. The temporal dynamics of both taxa in Lake Challa play a major role in the interpretation of past climate change in equatorial East Africa. The other new taxon, N. pseudoaequalis, was common in some epilithic samples taken from the littoral zone of Lake Challa. It was also sporadically observed in the pelagic phytoplankton near the end of the mixing season.

Plastira Region (C. Greece) in April and July 2000	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 7TH INTERNATIOANL CONFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, VOL C, POSTERS					7th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology	SEP 03-06, 2001	ERMOUPOLIS, GREECE					Fifteen sites were sampled for macrobenthic organisms, and physicochemical parameters taken in streams discharging into Lake Plastira (Central Greece) at two different seasons. The recording of the physical structure of the sites had also taken place parallelly to the samplings in spring. Biotic indices, habitat quality scores, the multi-variate techniques of FUZZY and CANOCO, the ordination technique of PCA and correlation matrices were applied to the data, It was found that site 2J had a distinctly different macrobenthic community, with all biotic indices, the Hellenic as well, designating it as having a poorer water quality than all the other sites. The latter may be due to the increased sediment deposition into the stream as a result of anthropogenic influences or to its high fine sediment composition, The application of the Hellenic score for the first time proved to have as an advantage the fact that it takes into account habitat deficiencies. The assessment of the streams' habitat quality showed that site 1A was the poorest. Neither the number of taxa nor the Greek LQI proved to be correlated to the habitat quality scores. The application pointed out problems that have to be solved in the future studies.

A Comparison of Airborne Microwave Brightness Temperatures and Snowpack Properties Across the Boreal Forests of Finland and Western Canada	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												The seasonal snowpack across the boreal forest is an important national resource in both Canada and Finland, contributing freshwater for agriculture, human consumption, and hydropower generation. In both countries, satellite passive microwave data are utilized to provide operational information on snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) throughout the snow cover season. Airborne passive microwave surveys conducted independently across Finland and western Canada during March and April 2005 and March 2006 provided the opportunity to assess the level of similarity in snowpack physical properties and brightness temperature response to snowpack qualities using two independent data sets. The primary objectives of these campaigns were to determine the influence of small-scale heterogeneity on satellite data, using relatively high resolution airborne measurements, and to assess the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) snow emission model capability of predicting emitted brightness temperatures under varying snowpack and landscape conditions. Comparisons of brightness temperature emissions over different land cover types showed a clear distinction of wetlands and snow-covered ice from forested and open areas. This is reflected also as a strong relationship between 6.9-GHz measurements and fractional lake cover in both Canada and Finland, with relationships at 18 and 37 GHz being less consistent between data sets. Comparisons of experimental data versus HUT snow emission model predictions showed relatively good agreement between the simulations and airborne data., specifically for the Finnish data set.

J	Sommer, B; Horwitz, P				Sommer, B; Horwitz, P			Water quality and macroinvertebrate response to acidification following intensified summer droughts in a Western Australian wetland	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												A decline in pH from similar to6-8 to similar to4-5 over a period of 4 years was detected during routine monitoring of surface waters at Lake Jandabup. This was accompanied by lower water levels, shorter periods of inundation and measurable changes in other attributes of the water: sulfate, iron and ammonium concentrations increased markedly, and filterable reactive phosphorus and colour (gilvin) decreased. Macroinvertebrate family richness did not change notably over this period, but there were shifts in community structure: ostracods, isopods and oligochaete worms became less abundant; amphipods, mayflies and gastropods disappeared, while ceratopogonids (Diptera) and macrothricid cladocerans increased in abundance. Historical evidence suggests that at least one other acidification event has occurred in the recent past. Mechanisms associated with the acidification, and the wetland's capacity to recover from such events, are discussed.

J	Seda, J; Kubecka, J				Seda, J; Kubecka, J			Long-term biomanipulation of Rimov Reservoir (Czech Republic)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The history of fish, zooplankton and phytoplankton in Rimov Reservoir during its 14 years existence is documented. After the filling of the reservoir in autumn 1978, the biomass of planktivorous fish increased from near zero to 650 kg ha(-1) by the fourth year of the reservoir's existence, after which the fish stock continually decreased under various forms of biomanipulative pressure, down to a value of about 100 kg ha(-1). This development of fish stock was accompanied by changes in zooplankton size structure, but a cascading effect down to reduction of phytoplankton biomass was not pronounced. The changes of zooplankton body size structure were: increasing or decreasing average size of Daphnia galeata (the main cladoceran herbivore species) and changes in relative proportion of cladoceran species, but none of the main zooplankton species was replaced or disappeared. The variation in phytoplankton biomass was explained by variation in phosphorus concentration and not related to zooplankton structure. It was concluded that the critical biomass of planktivorous fish below which the effect of lowering phytoplankton biomass could be observed lies below 100 kg of planktivorous fish per hectare. An attempt is made to quantify the relationship between fish stock density and the size structure of zooplankton potentially able to influence top-down effects on phytoplankton.

Trade-offs in nutrient and sediment losses in tile drainage from no-till versus conventional conservation-till cropping systems	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Nutrient and soil loss from agricultural areas impairs surface water quality globally. In the Great Lakes region, increases in the frequency and magnitude of harmful and nuisance algal blooms in freshwater lakes have been linked to elevated phosphorus (P) losses from agricultural fields, some of which are transported via tile drainage. This study examined whether concentrations and loads of P fractions, total suspended sediments (TSS), nitrate (NO3-), and ammonium (NH4+) in tile drainage in a clay soil differed between a continuous no-till system combining cover crops and surface broadcast fertilizer (no-till cover crop [NTCC]), and a more conventional tillage system with shallow tillage, fertilizer incorporation and limited use of cover crops (conventional conservation-till, CT). Both sites had modest soil fertility levels. Year-round, high-frequency observations of tile drainage flow and chemistry are described over 4 full water years and related to management practices on the associated fields. There were similar water yields in tile drainage between the two systems; however, losses of TSS, particulate P (PP), and NO3- were consistently greater from the CT site, which received larger quantities of fertilizer. In contrast, dissolved reactive P (DRP) losses were considerably greater from the NTCC site, offsetting the lower PP losses, such that there was little difference in TP losses between sites. Approximately 60% of the DRP losses from the NTCC site over the 4 years were associated with incidental losses following surface application of fertilizer in fall. This study provides insight into trade-offs in controlling losses of different nutrient fractions using different management systems.

Bacterioplankton were collected during mid-summer (Jan. 2002) from water samples (2 l) filtered first through a 1.2-mu m filter then a 0.2-mu m membrane filter representing the particle-attached and free-living sub-communities, respectively. DNA was extracted from filters and purified and a 16S rRNA clone library established for each habitat. Over 300 clones were sequenced and checked for similarity to existing 16S sequences in GenBank using the BLAST algorithm with default parameters. Further classification of clones was done using a species "backbone" attachment followed by parsimony analysis. The majority (85%) of sequences, referred to here as operational taxonomic units (OTUs), were most similar to uncultured bacterium 16S sequences. OTUs from each Proteobacteria sub-phylum (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, E >) were present in the Upper Parana River system, as well as members of the Bacteroidetes. The microbial assemblage from Patos Lagoon was least like other samples in that it had no Firmicutes present and was dominated by Actinobacteria. Verrucomicrobia OTUs were only found in the free-living assemblage. This study documents the presence of globally distributed phyla in Upper Parana River and taxa unique to habitat and particle attachment.

To validate this hypothesis, a 4-week floating mesocosms experiment that involved a cyanobacterial decay-growth-decay period was conducted at Lake Taihu. In addition to conventional methods for detecting the physical and chemical properties, quantitative real-time PCR was used to identify the nitrification and denitrification genes (archaeal and bacterial amoA, nirS and nirK). Treatment with cyanobacteria led to removal of about 3.62 mg N L-1 total nitrogen, 40% of which was organic nitrogen, indicating a nitrogen transformation and removal mechanism was present in the system. Variations in the biogeochemical properties suggested that remineralization and coupling nitrification and denitrification by epiphytic and pelagic microorganisms was the primary pathway through which organic nitrogen was removed. The results of this study revealed that algal blooms can accelerate nitrogen removal efficiency, which may be the primary reason that nitrogen is limited in summer in Lake Taihu.

J	Peczula, W				Peczula, Wojciech			Variability of coloured dissolved organic carbon in seepage humic lakes as related to lake morphometry, catchment characteristics and precipitation.	ECOHYDROLOGY												The variability of coloured dissolved organic carbon (CDOC) in ten seepage and humic lakes was studied in an attempt to find out whether the morphometry of lake bodies and their catchment characteristics influence the studied factor during the ice-free season. The study was carried out in two consecutive years differed with annual sum of precipitation. Using an absorption coefficient at 320nm as a proxy of CDOC content, and a coefficient of variation as a measure of its variability, we correlated these to lake and catchment features. The results showed that out of 11 studied characteristics, two (maximum and mean depth of the lake) were negatively correlated (-0.85 and -0.78, P<0.01) and three (catchment size, drainage ratio and Schindler ratio) were positively correlated (0.64, 0.73, P<0.05; 0.86, P<0.01) to the studied variable. We have hence concluded that: (1) in more shallow lakes with greater catchment size, more intense mechanism of DOC loss exist during the summer, in contrast to deeper lakes with thermal stratification; (2) precipitation has a strong influence on CDOC inter-annual and seasonal variability, particularly in shallow lakes with high forest cover in their catchments.

J	Mangerud, J				Mangerud, J			Was Hardangerfjorden, western Norway, glaciated during the Younger Dryas?	NORSK GEOLOGISK TIDSSKRIFT												A new site with a shell-bearing till is described from the outer part of Hardangerfjorden. Two shell fragments from the till were dated to 10,870 +/- 90 and 11,000 +/- 40 radiocarbon years BP. These dates support the established hypothesis of a major glacial re-advance and an ice-filled Hardangerfjorden during the Younger Dryas. An opposite hypothesis, that Hardangerfjorden remained ice-free during the entire Younger Dryas, was proposed in a recent paper by Helle el al. (1997; Norsk Geologisk Tidsskrift 77, 101-117) and supported by several scientists during the Nordic Geological Winter Meeting in 2000. I argue in the present paper that the latter hypothesis is falsified, not only by the two new dates, but also by previously published dates from shell-bearing tills and sub-till sediments. In my opinion, the data presented by Helle et al. allow for alternative interpretations.

Both populations consisted mostly of smooth-walled quadriflagellates. They occurred in slush, and shared similar photosynthetic performances (photoinhibition above 1300 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)), very high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA, 64% and 74% respectively) and abundant astaxanthin accumulation, comparable to the red spores of Chlamydomonas nivalis (Bauer) Wille. Physiological differences between the Slovak and Austrian populations included higher levels of -tocopherol and a 13Z-isomer of astaxanthin in the former. High accumulation of secondary pigments in the Slovak population probably reflected harsher environmental conditions, since the collection was made later in the growing season when cells were exposed to higher irradiance at the surface. Using a polyphasic approach, we compared Chlainomonas sp. with Chlamydomonasnivalis. The latter causes ?conventional red snow, and shows high photophysiological plasticity, with high efficiency under low irradiance and no photoinhibition up to 2000 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1). Its PUFA content was significantly lower (50%). An annual cycle of lake-to-snow colonization by Chlainomonas sp. from slush layers deeper in the ice cover is proposed. Our results point to an ecologically highly specialized cryoflora species, whose global distribution is likely to be more widespread than previously assumed.

From 1981 to 1988, the level and fluctuations of the atmospheric deposition of acidifying substances has led to various responses in the water chemistry of headwater lakes in the area. The general trend in atmospheric inputs is a gradual increase of acidifying substances from 1981 to 1985 followed by a 2 yr decrease then a return to previous values. In the two lakes with almost no alkalinity acidification has occurred throughout the 1983 to 1988 period. In the four lakes with slightly higher alkalinity values, a reversal in acidification is seen when atmospheric loading decreased in 1986. Along with the interannual trends, seasonal variability to acidification occurs with sensitivity of surface waters being highest during spring melt. Sensitivity to acidification can also be altered by watershed processes and in the Laflamme Lake Watershed, soil processes are effective in altering the acidity of precipitation before it reached the lake. In this watershed, wet atmospheric inputs of H+ and NO3- are larger than surface water outputs while the reverse occurs for Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Cl- and SO42-.																			0049-6979					JAN	1992	61	1-2					95	105		10.1007/BF00478368	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00478368													WOS:A1992HB33200007

Generally, significantly higher pore water concentrations were found under the cages compared to controls. However, only in April 1992 were these concentrations of the same magnitude as those found in temperate studies. The average flux of particulate material under the cages, 20-49 g m(-2) per day, was up to 22 times greater compared to controls, Carbon accumulated only in April 1994, implying rapid decomposition. This was supported by a 4-25-fold higher outward nux of ammonium and phosphate from the farm sediment but sediment O-2 consumption was only 29-40% higher compared to control sites. It was concluded that intensive fish farming in the tropics can generate similar eutrophication effects that are observed in temperate regions, However, the results also indicated that a tropical lake system may be able to process local deposition of organic wastes better than a temperate one, suggesting that microbial decomposition may be a rapid and prominent process.					; Troell, Max/I-1724-2019	Troell, Max/0000-0002-7509-8140; Berg, Hakan/0000-0003-3260-9710													1355-557X					JUL	1997	28	7					527	544																WOS:A1997XH45500006

Sub-surface dynamics and eruptive styles of maars in the Colli Albani Volcanic District, Central Italy	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH					General Assembly of the International-Association-of-Geodesy/24th General Assembly of the International-Union-of-Geodesy-and-Geophysics	JUL 02-13, 2007	Perugia, ITALY	Int Assoc Geodesy, Int Union Geodesy & Geophys				Eruptive scenarios associated with the possible reactivation of maar-forming events in the Quaternary, ultrapotassic Colli Albani Volcanic District (CAVD) provides implications for volcanic hazard assessment in the densely populated area near Rome. Based on detailed stratigraphy, grain size, componentry, ash morphoscopy and petro-chemical analyses of maar eruption products, along with textural analysis of cored juvenile clasts, we attempt to reconstruct the eruptive dynamics of the Prata Porci and Albano maars, as related to pre- and syn-eruptive interactions between trachybasaltic to K-foiditic feeder magmas and carbonate-silicoclastic and subvolcanic country rocks. Magma volumes in the order of 0.5-3.1 x 10(8) m(3) were erupted during the monogenetic Prata Porci maar activity and the three eruptive cycles of the Albano multiple maar, originating loose to strongly lithified, wet and dry pyroclastic surge deposits, Strombolian scoria fall horizons and lithic-rich explosion breccias. These deposits contain a wide range of accessory and accidental lithic clasts, with significant vertical stratigraphic variations in the lithic types and abundances. The two maar study cases hold a record of repeated transitions between magmatic (i.e, Strombolian fallout) and hydromagmatic (wet and dry pyroclastic surges) activity styles. Evidence of phreatic explosions, a common precursor of explosive volcanic activity, is only found at the base of the Prata Ford eruptive succession. The quantitative evaluation of the proportions of the different eruptive styles in the stratigraphic record of the two maars, based on magma vs. lithic volume estimates, reveals a prevailing magmatic character in terms of erupted magma volumes despite the hydromagmatic footprint. Different degrees of explosive magma-water interaction were apparently controlled by the different hydrogeological and geological-structural settings. In the Prata Ford case, shifts in the depth of magma fragmentation are proposed to have accompanied eruption style changes. In the Albano case, a deeply dissected geothermal aquifer in peri-caldera setting and variable mass eruption rates were the main controlling factors of repeated shifts in the eruptive style. Finally, textural evidence from cored juvenile clasts and analytical modeling of melt-solid heat transfer indicate that the interacting substrate in the Prata Porci case was at low, uniform temperature (similar to 100 degrees C) as compared to the highly variable temperatures (up to 700-800 degrees C) inferred for the geothermal system beneath Albano.

Sediment discharge to the fjord increased from 13 x 10(3) t day(-1) in 1997 to 38 x 10(3) t day(-1) in 1999. CTD results, sediment traps and cores from the 2000 melt season document the impact of the surge on the glacimarine environment of the fjord. Within 4 km of the inflow sedimentation rates increased by 30 times over those before the surge, reaching an estimated maximum value of 29 cm a(-1) (up to 4.2 mm day(-1) between 24 July and 9 September 2000). Fine-grained deposits from suspension in the water column displayed diurnal laminations in response to the interaction of tidal cycles with the sediment plume; these are not found in the sediments deposited before surging. Thin beds of sandy turbidites from turbidity currents originating from slope failures on the delta front occurred at about 20 day intervals during the melt season. Each of these effects was limited to within several kilometres of the point of inflow, but provide a unique signal significantly different from those generated by normal hydroclimatically induced events.

The stands included three stands of tall and robust reed, situated in the Ingoi area, and two stands of short and subtle reed situated in the downstream part. While both the seasonal pattern and the proportions of single carbohydrate species corresponded to findings for other sites, the absolute concentrations were markedly lower as compared to other European reed stands except lake Ferto in Hungary. The seasonal minimum values ranged from 54 to 87 mg g(-1) dry weight. During the seasonal minimum, glucose reached the lowest concentrations (down to 0.01 mg g(-1) dry weight) of all carbohydrates measured. The seasonal maximum concentrations of TNC reached 160-270 mg g(-1) dry weight. Maximum TNC standing stock ranged from 240 to 520 g m(-2), and was depleted by 60-80% during the period of spring shoot growth. It is proposed that the remaining TNC pool may not suffice to support complete recovery after a subsequent catastrophic event. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

We enrolled 185 persons in a cohort study, 38 (20.5%) of whom had laboratory-confirmed cryptosporidiosis or gastrointestinal illness that met our clinical case definition. Having any exposure to lake water (e.g., swimming) was strongly associated with illness (P < .001), The outbreak lasted 4 weeks and affected an estimated 2,070 persons, The most likely sources of the outbreak were contaminated runoff of rainwater and infected bathers, This outbreak of cryptosporidiosis is the first reported to be associated with recreational exposure to lake water. Our investigation shows that even a large and ongoing outbreak may not be detected for several weeks, Health professionals and persons at high risk for severe cryptosporidiosis should be aware that recreational water can be a source of cryptosporidium infection.																			1058-4838	1537-6591				JAN	1998	26	1					27	33		10.1086/516271	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/516271								9455506					WOS:000071474500005

Short-term succession of aquatic plant species richness along ecosystem productivity and dispersal gradients in shallow lakes	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions The highest species richness is usually expected at an intermediate stage of development since the last major disturbance event, but some studies have shown that ecosystem productivity and dispersal may modify this pattern, suggesting the need for further studies on the effects of productivity and dispersal on the dynamics of species richness through succession. In this study, we analysed aquatic plant species richness in relation to (1) succession stage, measured as numbers of years since the last disturbance that affected the ecosystems; (2) lake productivity, measured as the chlorophyll a concentration; and (3) connectivity to similar nearby ecosystems, a proxy for the potential input of diaspores. Location Shallow lakes of the Dombes region, France. Methods Every 57 yr these shallow lakes are emptied and left to dry out for 1 yr. These drought disturbances lead to complete destruction of the submerged aquatic plant communities. Sixty lakes arranged along a gradient of productivity were selected. The probability of diaspore input was considered to increase from upstream to downstream, as lakes are organized in hydrologically connected networks via ditches, through which the downstream lakes receive water from the upstream lakes. For each lake, the aquatic plant species richness (from systematic summer vegetation sampling), time since the last disturbance (last summer drying), productivity (estimated as chlorophyll a concentration) and probability of diaspore input (assessed from position in the network) were recorded. Results The aquatic plant species richness decreased with the time since the last disturbance for all of the lakes, but there was a significant interaction with the chlorophyll a concentration and position of the lake in the network. At the lowest ecosystem productivities, the relationship between successional stage and species richness was hump-shaped, whereas the species richness decreased with increasing time since the last disturbance when productivity increased. The lake's position in the network did not influence species richness during the first 2 yr after disturbance, but from year 3 and thereafter, lakes connected to high numbers of upstream lakes consistently exhibited decreased richness, contradicting the expected trend of increasing species richness with increasing diaspore inputs. Conclusions This study indicates that both ecosystem productivity and connectivity strongly affected the relationship between aquatic plant species richness and succession, and that these factors should be taken into account in further developments of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis.					; bornette, gudrun/J-6404-2017	Wezel, Alexander/0000-0001-5088-5087; bornette, gudrun/0000-0002-2242-0060													1100-9233	1654-1103				JAN	2013	24	1					148	156		10.1111/j.1654-1103.2012.01436.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1654-1103.2012.01436.x													WOS:000312156600016
J	Del Pozzo, ALM; Cordoba, C				Del Pozzo, ALM; Cordoba, C			Volcanic impact on the southern basin of Mexico during the Holocene	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The interstratification of volcanic and glacial deposits in Central Mexico has been helpful in correlating the time sequence of these events. Two glacial advances and many eruptions have occurred during the last 10,000 years, although conditions have changed drastically since the last eruptions in the 1920s (Popocatepetl). The origin and evolution of several lakes (Basin of Mexico) are related to vulcanism and periods of warmer and colder climatic conditions. Fifty monogenetic volcanoes have erupted near Mexico City during the Holocene, probably during 20-22 different eruptive periods since some are superimposed vents similar to the Jorullo vents which erupted 200 years ago in Michoacan, Mexico. The youngest of these volcanoes are Chichinautzin and Xitle (2030+/-60 years BP) whose lavas covered approximately 80 km each. The Xitle eruption began with ash emission mainly towards the NW and was later dominated by lava flow fed by tubes. This lava covered the Cuicuilco prehispanic urban center and the agricultural areas near it. The lava dammed and caused silting of the Magdalena, Xicotitla and Chicuautitla Rivers and deflected the drainage pattern in general. The eruption of Chichinautzin and the other Holocene volcanoes have drastically changed the topography and caused fires as can be seen in the carbonized branches at the base of the flows. Chichinautzin Volcano was formed by successive thin lavas which flowed to the south and by thicker flows to the east, west and north. Older Holocene volcanoes are responsible for the formation of the Zempoala and Xochimico Lakes. Popocatepetl is a 5450-m high stratovolcano to the east of Mexico City which has been subject to glacial processes. Its eruptions have been documented since the 14th century, the last being in the 1920s. Most of these eruptions caused ash fall mainly to the east and northeast but lava emissions and flooding have also been reported. Larger eruptions in the earlier history produced pyroclastic flows and surges, lahars, Plinian pumice falls and two debris avalanches. A preliminary map of the type of volcanism which has affected the different areas and its implications for future hazards is presented.

In the runoff zone, the snow-rain components prevail; in the nival zone of Central Asia, important precipitation has been observed. Summer runoff decrease for the period 20-30 years, caused by glacier reduction, is insignificant in comparison with other water balance components. (2) The zone of runoff formation is rather small; the rainfall is smaller than in other regions; glacial melting, which forms river runoff, becomes essential. Thus, glacial decrease in the Karakul Lake basin for 1925-1980, equal to 13.6 km(2), resulted in a lake area decrease equal to 8.3 km(2). (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Optimal growth occurred at 33-35 degrees C, pH 7.0-7.5, and in the presence of 2-4% (w/v) NaCl. The DNA G+C content was 40.0 mol%. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine and three unknown lipids. The predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-15:0, iso-C-17:0 3-OH and iso-C-15:0 3-OH, and MK-7 was the main respiratory quinone. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain G22(T) fell within the class Bacteroidia. Its closest phylogenetic neighbour was the recently described species Draconibacterium orientale, the sole member of the family Draconibacteriaceae, with merely 90.04% sequence similarity. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic evidence observed, a novel species in a new genus, Tangfeifania diversioriginum gen. nov., sp. nov., is proposed within the family Draconibacteriaceae.

Globally, tufa architecture and depositional details are poorly understood as most described tufas have been degraded by weathering and erosion. In the hyperarid Atacama, post-depositional alteration is negligible, therefore, the exceptional preservation of Santa Juana tufas documented in this study provides new information about tufa facies and their complex interactions. Santa Juana facies include microbial stromatolites, phytoherms, cascadestone, flowstone and porous limestone. Phytoherms, consisting of former plant stems coated with calcite, developed in channels, within pools, and along spring discharge aprons. Cascadestone, representing former waterfalls, preserves microbial filaments and delicate V-shaped calcite crystals. Flowstone lines shallow subvertical to subhorizontal channels, representing sites of rapidly sluicing water flow. Porous limestone, containing sparse calcite and/or gypsum and anhydrite cement crystals, represents detrital accumulations. Stable isotope results, coupled with U/Th ages, show that by the Quaternary, relative to the Neogene, groundwater was less supercharged with volcanogenic CO2 so degassing was moderated. The delta O-18 ratios from Miocene-Pliocene palustrine and lacustrine freshwater carbonates that underlie Santa Juana tufas indicate significant evaporation, but the tufa delta O-18 signal indicates a less evaporative trend due to shorter atmosphere exposure time. Biological fractionation in delta C-13 is largely masked by the region's volcanogenic carbon footprint, although tufa petrography shows well-preserved microbial filaments and laminations. The range of tufa ages in this study shows that there were wetter time periods within the drainage basin headwater area in the Quaternary, but that by the late Pleistocene to early Holocene, aridity to hyperaridity became established. The lack of diagenesis or alteration within the Santa Juana tufas indicates that there has been minimal rainfall since their deposition.

Survival of Frog Virus 3 in Freshwater and Sediment from an English Lake	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES												Ranaviruses can be transmitted by contaminated water and sediment but must retain infectivity for a sufficient period to reach and infect a susceptible host. To determine the risk a virus represents once it enters the environment, its persistence in that environment must be determined. We evaluated the survival of frog virus 3 (FV3) in water and sediment from an English lake at temperatures of 4, 15, 20, and 30 C over time. The virus survived in both water and sediment; however, survival times were significantly lower in sediment. The virus lost infectivity in both matrices with a rise in temperature. In water, time required for a 90% reduction in virus titer decreased from 34 d at 4 C to 5 d at 30 C. In sediment, required time for a 90% reduction decreased from 10 d at 4 C to 1 d at 30 C. These results can be used to estimate the persistence of FV3 in the environment and indicate that the virus could remain infectious in temperate locations for extended periods during winter.																			0090-3558	1943-3700				JAN	2016	52	1					138	142		10.7589/2015-02-033	http://dx.doi.org/10.7589/2015-02-033								26555105					WOS:000367901800018

These changes, coupled with temperature variations, may impart diel (24-h) fluctuations in the concentration of trace metals, nutrients, and other chemical species. A better understanding of diel processes in rivers is needed and will lead to improved methods of data collection for both monitoring and research purposes. Previous studies have used stable isotopes of dissolved oxygen (DO) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) as tracers of geochemical and biological processes in streams, lakes, and marine systems. Although seasonal variation in 6180 of DO in rivers and lakes has been documented, no study has investigated diel changes in this parameter. Here, we demonstrate large (up to 13 parts per thousand) cycles in delta(18)O-DO for two late summer sampling periods in the Big Hole River of southwest Montana and illustrate that these changes are correlated to variations in the DO concentration, the C-isotopic composition of DIC, and the primary productivity of the system. The magnitude of the diel cycle in delta(18)O-DO was greater in August versus September because of the longer photoperiod and warmer water temperatures. This study provides another biogeochemical tool for investigating the O-2 and C budgets in rivers and may also be applicable to lake and groundwater systems.					; Gammons, Christopher/AIF-1238-2022	DeGrandpre, Michael/0000-0003-1969-6709; 													0013-936X					SEP 15	2005	39	18					7134	7140		10.1021/es0505595	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es0505595								16201639					WOS:000231941700034

Due to global warming, the thickness and phenology of the lake ice has been changing, which profoundly affects the regional climate evolution. There are a few studies about lake ice in alpine regions, but the understanding of climatological characteristics of lake ice on the QTP is still limited. Based on a field experiment in the winter of 2022, the thermal conductivity of Qinghai Lake ice was determined as 1.64 W<middle dot>m-1<middle dot>degrees C-1. Airborne radar ice thickness data, meteorological observations, and remote sensing images were used to evaluate a quasi-steady ice model (Lepp & auml;ranta model) performance of the lake. This is an analytic model of lake ice thickness and phenology. The long-term (1979-2017) ice history of the lake was simulated. The results showed that the modeled mean ice thickness was 0.35 m with a trend of -0.002 m<middle dot>a-1, and the average freeze-up start (FUS) and break-up end (BUE) were 30 December and 5 April, respectively, which are close to the field and satellite observations. The simulated trend of the maximum ice thickness from 1979 to 2017 (0.004 m<middle dot>a-1) was slightly higher than the observed result (0.003 m<middle dot>a-1). The simulated trend was 0.20 d<middle dot>a-1 for the FUS, -0.34 d<middle dot>a-1 for the BUE, and -0.54 d<middle dot>a-1 for the ice duration (ID). Correlation and detrending analysis were adopted for the contribution of meteorological factors. In the winters of 1979-2017, downward longwave radiation and air temperature were the two main factors that had the best correlation with lake ice thickness. In a detrending analysis, air temperature, downward longwave radiation, and solar radiation contributed the most to the average thickness variability, with contributions of 42%, 49%, and -48%, respectively, and to the maximum thickness variability, with contributions of 41%, 45%, and -48%, respectively. If the six meteorological factors (air temperature, downward longwave radiation, solar radiation, wind speed, pressure, and specific humidity) are detrending, ice thickness variability will increase 83% on average and 87% at maximum. Specific humidity, wind, and air pressure had a poor correlation with ice thickness. The findings in this study give insights into the long-term evolutionary trajectory of Qinghai Lake ice cover and serve as a point of reference for investigating other lakes in the QTP during cold seasons.

Estimates of phosphorus entrainment in Lake Mendota: a comparison of one-dimensional and three-dimensional approaches	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Entrainment of phosphorus across the thermocline can be an important nutrient source for phytoplankton in stratified lakes. In eutrophic stratified lakes, seasonal entrainment can be responsible for delayed recovery following a decrease in external phosphorus load. We compared seasonal estimates of entrainment derived from single- and multilocation thermocline migration approaches. Entrainment estimates from these methods were similar. A sampling approach based on a single centralized location produced whole-lake entrainment estimates in general agreement with the mean value from the multilocation approach (the single- location approach reasonably reproduced patterns at a weekly and seasonal time scale). In this study, it was not essential to account for spatial variation in estimating annual rates of entrainment. We also estimated entrainment based on a three-dimensional (3-D) hydrodynamic model over a short period of significant thermocline migration. The 3-D model was most useful in exposing spatial and temporal variation in temperature and phosphorus profiles that are otherwise difficult to observe. Spatial variation in phosphorus profiles was associated with upwelling of metalimnetic water represented by the 3-D model. These transient dynamics, though a relatively small portion of an annual phosphorus budget, may supply nutrients to epilimnetic phytoplankton during periods of nutrient limitation. There is a need for further research that combines 3-D hydrodynamic modeling with field collection of biological and chemical data.

Nevertheless, the effects of these conversions on soil microbes, particularly in wetland ecosystem, are not well explicit. To explore the impact of land-use intensification on soil microbial communities, monthly soil samples were obtained from replicate plots representing three land-use types (NW, RW, and GH) in subtropical wetlands and then subjected to amplicon sequencing. Land-use intensification had direct effects on bacterial and fungal community composition, with a more pronounced impact on bacteria than on fungi. These changes in bacterial communities were closely correlated with variations in soil environmental variables, such as NO3--N, pH, and electrical conductivity. Land-use intensification led to a decrease in bacterial deterministic processes, with an opposing trend observed in the fungal community. In addition, arable lands (RW and GH), which are affected by anthropogenic activities, exhibited more complex networks. Potential metabolic functional groups in GH had higher absolute abundance. Seasonal variations significantly influenced microbial diversity, composition, and potential metabolic functional groups within each land-use type, particularly in summer, although the magnitude of this impact was much smaller than the impact of land-use intensification. Our findings emphasize the importance of comprehending the ecological consequences of land-use intensification in wetlands for sustainable resource management and biodiversity conservation.

Numbers, biomass, primary production, chlorophyll-a content, species composition, (blue-green, r, Euglena-r, diatom Chlorococcales, oligotrophic and eutrophic algae) indicator species and association-types were considered. As a 1st manifestation of eutrophication, species composition changed. Algae, characteristic of eutrophic lakes appeared in 1970-1975. In 1976 the numbers and the primary production increased to eutrophic levels. Biomass and chlorophyll-a content began to increase 3 yr later, in 1978. These variables reached the mesotrophic levels in the summers of 1970 and 1980.					Padisak, Judit/B-4514-2008														0006-8144						1982	69	1-2					71	84																WOS:A1982QG65600008
J	Schneider, JC				Schneider, JC			Fate of dead fish in a small lake	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Observations and experiments were conducted on natural mortality of fish at a small Michigan lake during spring. During an extensive fish die-off in 1989, only 22% (202) of the dead fish were found el en though an estimated 10% (918) of the fish population >150 mm TL died. Scavengers, principally yellow bullheads (Ameiurus natalis) and turtles feeding in the littoral zone, claimed approximately 60% of the dead fish that year and 82% in another year with a smaller die-off. The remainder decomposed in 6-34 days. The long-standing mystery of why so few large dead fish are noticed in lakes, despite high annual natural mortality rates of abundant fish populations, was adequately explained by unseen decomposition in deep water and the ability of resident scavengers to keep up with the supply of dead fish except during unusually concentrated fish die-offs.																			0003-0031					JUL	1998	140	1					192	196		10.1674/0003-0031(1998)140[0192:FODFIA]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031(1998)140[0192:FODFIA]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000075014000021

Aquatic plant wax hydrogen and carbon isotopes in Greenland lakes record shifts in methane cycling during past Holocene warming	SCIENCE ADVANCES												Predicting changes to methane cycling in Arctic lakes is of global concern in a warming world but records constraining lake methane dynamics with past warming are rare. Here, we demonstrate that the hydrogen isotopic composition (delta H-2) of mid-chain waxes derived from aquatic moss clearly decouples from precipitation during past Holocene warmth and instead records incorporation of methane in plant biomass. Trends in delta H-2(moss) and delta C-13(moss) values point to widespread Middle Holocene (11,700 to 4200 years ago) shifts in lake methane cycling across Greenland during millennia of elevated summer temperatures, heightened productivity, and lowered hypolimnetic oxygen. These data reveal ongoing warming may lead to increases in methane-derived C in many Arctic lakes, including lakes where methane is not a major component of the C cycle today. This work highlights a previously unrecognized mechanism influencing delta H-2 values of mid-chain wax and draws attention to the unquantified role of common aquatic mosses as a potentially important sink of lake methane across the Arctic.

J	CROSSMAN, EJ				CROSSMAN, EJ			DISTRIBUTION AND MOVEMENTS OF A PREDATOR, THE RAINBOW TROUT, AND ITS PREY, THE REDSIDE SHINER, IN PAUL LAKE, BRITISH-COLUMBIA	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												Predatory rainbow trout, while not confined to any part of the lake, appear to move into areas of greatest shoal development at a time when their prey, redside shiners, are most heavily concentrated there. A complex movement pattern apparently governed by shoal water temperature leads to a seasonal distribution of shiners which brings the prey into contact with the predator in midsummer. Distribution of the prey on the shoals around the lake shows prey to be most heavily concentrated over areas of extensive shoal and only small numbers present along steep shore areas. In areas of heavy concentration shiners show a definite vertical and horizontal distribution of sizes; the larger prey always found farther from shore or deeper than smaller shiners. In addition, there are vertical seasonal movements of shiners at shoal edge and a diurnal pattern of movement from shoal to deep water after dark. The effect of the movement patterns of predator and prey are manifested in the diet of the trout. In Aug., shiners constitute over 90% of the diet of predatory trout(those over 10 inches in length), but shiners are a negligible item in the winter diet.																									1959	16	3					247	267		10.1139/f59-021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f59-021													WOS:A1959WZ51900001

J	Yang, CH; Li, JY; Yin, HB				Yang, Chunhui; Li, Jiying; Yin, Hongbin			Phosphorus internal loading and sediment diagenesis in a large eutrophic lake (Lake Chaohu, China)	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Sediment phosphorus (P) release and retention are important in controlling whole-system P dynamics and budget in eutrophic lakes. Here we combine short- (seasonal) and long-term (years to decades) studies to quantify the internal P loading and P release potential in the sediments of Lake Chaohu and explore their controlling mechanisms. In the west region of the lake, short-term P diffusive fluxes ranged from 0.2 mg/m(2).d(-1) to 6.69 mg/m(2).d(-1) (averaged 2.76 mg/m(2).d(-1)) and long-term net P release ranged from 2.25 mg/m(2).d(-1) to 8.94 mg/m(2).d(-1) (averaged 5.34 mg/m(2).d(-1)); in the east region, short-term P diffusive fluxes varied from 0.73 mg/m(2).d(-1) to 1.76 mg/m(2).d(-1) (averaged 1.05 mg/m(2).d(-1)) and long-term P release ranged from 0.13 mg/m(2).d(-1) to 4.15 mg/m(2).d(-1) (averaged 1.3 mg/m(2).d(-1)). Both short- and long-term P releases were in the same order of magnitudes as the external P inputs (3.56 mg/m(2).d(-1)). Comparison of the long-term and short-term sediment P release indicates that while the high summer P release in the east might only represent a snapshot value, the sediments in the west contribute to large P release for years or even decades, impeding water quality recovery under lake management. Mobilization of surface sediment legacy P accounted for 81% of short-term P release. The long-term release was dominated by remobilization of iron bond P (BD-P) (average 52.1%) at all sites, while Aluminium-bound P (NaOH-rP) exhibited partly reactive and potentially mobile, releasing P to the water column in most sites in the west. Our study demonstrates the importance of sediments as P sources in lake Chaohu. The combination of short- and long-term P release studies can help understand the roles of sediments in regulating the water quality and eutrophication.					; Yang, Chunhui/NNG-6838-2025; Li, Jiying/Y-9262-2019	Li, Jiying/0000-0003-1677-6922; Yang, Chunhui/0000-0002-9575-6104; Yin, Hongbin/0000-0002-7290-2500; 													0269-7491	1873-6424				JAN 1	2022	292		B						118471	10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118471	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118471		NOV 2021						34774673					WOS:000744242900005
J	Serizawa, H; Amemiya, T; Itoh, K				Serizawa, Hiroshi; Amemiya, Takashi; Itoh, Kiminori			Effects of buoyancy, transparency and zooplankton feeding on surface maxima and deep maxima: Comprehensive mathematical model for vertical distribution in cyanobacterial biomass	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Inhomogeneous vertical distributions of the cyanobacterial biomass are widely observed during the summer season in stratified lake ecosystems. Among these are surface maxima characterized by surface scum formation and deep or subsurface maxima also known as deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM). The former occurs at the epilimnion in eutrophic lakes, and are usually caused by colonial cyanobacteria such as Microcystis. On the other hand, the latter occurs at the metalimnion and the upper part of the hypolimnion near the thermocline in oligotrophic lakes, and are referred to filamentous cyanobacteria such as Oscillatoria. The aim of this paper is to present a simple mathematical model that can simultaneously describe these phenomena including the annual and diurnal variations, emphasizing the roles of buoyancy regulation, transparency of the lake and zooplankton feeding on cyanobacteria. According to our computer analyses, the increased buoyancy, the low clarity of the lake and the low rate of zooplankton feeding take significant roles in formation of surface maxima, while the reversal of these factors makes deep maxima predominant. Our two-component model with nutrients and cyanobacteria can distinguish between two phenomena by changing the parameters for these factors, without altering the model itself. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Here we present a continuous sediment record from a lake in the Larsemann Hills, situated on a peninsula believed to have been ice-free for at least 40,000 yr. A mutli-proxy data set including geochronology, diatoms, pigments and carbonate stable isotopes indicates warmer and wetter conditions than present in the early part of the record. We interpret this as Marine Isotope Stage 5e after application of a chronological age-depth model and similar ice core evidence. Dry and cold conditions are inferred during the last glacial, with lake-level minima, floristic changes towards a shallow water algal community, and a greater biological receipt of ultraviolet radiation. During the Last Glacial Maximum and Termination I the lake was perennially ice-covered, with minimal snowmelt in the catchment. After ca. 10,500 cal yr B.P., the lake became seasonally moated or ice-free during summer. Despite a low accumulation rate, the sediments document some Holocene environmental changes including neoglacial cooling after ca. 2450 cal yr B.P., and a gradual increase in aridity and salinity to the present.

The goal of the modelling was to calculate changes in sediment transport within the lake due to changes in lake bathymetry caused by diatomite mining. The model uses the Galerkin finite element method and consists of a hydrodynamic flow model and a transport-dispersion model. The flow model is based on the shallow water equations and the wave equation. The transport model is based on the conservation of mass for suspended sediment. The model was calibrated against measurements performed during the summer of 1992. These included measurements of water elevation, current velocity, wave height, and concentration of suspended sediment. After calibration, the model was run for different mining scenarios to determine their impact on the sediment transport in the lake.																			1386-2588	1573-5125					2004	38	2					145	162		10.1023/B:AECO.0000032049.94886.5a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:AECO.0000032049.94886.5a													WOS:000222064400005

Karst springs discharge water from aquifers in Triassic and Jurassic dolomites and limestones and collect in lakes, which are ponded behind accreting travertine dams. Waters at springs have a high CO2 partial-pressure (greater than 7000 ppm) and are slightly undersaturated with respect to calcite (saturation index less than -0.03). CO2 partial pressure is quickly reduced in swift running streams, leading to very high supersaturation with carbonate minerals (saturation indices between 0.74 and 0.53). Calcite deposition, however, is restricted to the lake bottoms (formation of lake marl) and to the tufa dams. The annual carbonate precipitating capacity of the system based on water balance and downstream loss of dissolved ions is estimated to be on the order of 10,000 t CaCO3 as cascade deposits (tufa dams) or as micrite in lakes behind the travertine dams. The initial stages of travertine formation as a result of morphological, biological, and chemical factors are (i) moss settling on small ridges in the creek courses, (ii) epiphytes (diatoms and cyanobacteria) settling on the moss surface, (iii) micrite particles resuspending from lake bottoms and being trapped n mucous excretions from bacteria and diatoms, and (iv) inorganic calcite precipitating as sparite at nucleation sites provided by these crystal seeds. Geochemical studies of the lake marl and tufa dams show that amino acids are dominated by aspartic acid. Carbohydrates come from structural polysaccharides of diatoms. The sticky excretions, rich in aspartic acid, are necessary for the initiation of calcite precipitation. They may be a response of algal and bacterial metabolism to environmental stress by either nutrient depletion or high calcium concentrations in ambient waters. The formation of tufa and micrite (lake marl) appears to be initiated by localized biological factors and is not governed by mere calcite supersaturation of the water. Oligotrophy may be an essential precondition for the formation of fresh water carbonate deposits.

In this study, relatively high-resolution bathymetric data from Lake Sunnet (NW Anatolia) revealed five deep (5.7 to 9.2m) and narrow (10 to 20m) depressions located along the boundary between the lake bottom and the steep lake margins. Analysis of lake level data belonging to dry seasons hints no leakage through these depressions. However, the negative conical shape and weakly developed levees around the holes suggest an upward episodic groundwater discharge for which direct evidence has been absent up to date. A combined hydraulic and soil mechanical model successfully explains the pockmark activity due to the flow of water through conduits in karstic carbonate bedrock. According to sedimentation rates and average depth of pockmarks in Lake Sunnet, and available regional paleoclimate studies, the onset of pockmark activity might coincide with the transition from the Near East Aridification Phase to the humid Beysehir Occupation Phase around 300 BCE in SW and NW Anatolia.

The technique has great potential for environmental monitoring of aqueous systems. This study assesses relationships, using PLS regression, between NIR spectra of seston collected on glass fibre filters and the following measured lake water parameters: total organic carbon (TOC), total phosphorus (TP), Abs420 and pH. Water samples were collected from 271 oligotrophic lakes during autumn 1995. The predictive model for TOC explained 68% of the variance (SEP=2.1 mg L-1. range 14.9 mg L-1), and that for colour 71% (SEP=0.04 A, range 0.36 A), while the explained variances for pH and TP were 72% (SEP=0.36, mu g L-1 range 3.13 mu g L-1) and 45% (SEP =4 eta g L-1, range 41 mu g L-1), respectively. A model correlating NIR spectra and the actual amount of phosphorus in the seston captured on filters explained 86% of the variance (SEP = 0.044 mu g/filter, range 0.47). Several pretreatments and regression techniques were used in an attempt to enhance modeling performance. However, straightforward PLS on raw data performed best in all cases.

The objective was to determine the absolute and relative importance of rotifers and crustaceans as grazers of algal productivity. The indigenous phytoplankton (primarily Cryptomonas, Cyclotella, Navicula, Rhodomonas and 3 to 6-mu-m nanoflagellates) was labelled with C-14 and used as the food source in the experiments. Mid-day zooplankton community filtration rates were among the highest reported, with herbivores clearing up to 73 % of the water column per hour. In May and June, nauplii and small cladocerans (Bosmina longirostris, Chydorus sphaericus and Moina micrura) accounted for most of community filtration, while rotifers (especially Brachionus, Keratella and Polyarthra) dominated filtration in July and August. In September, community filtration continued to be rotifer-dominated at two stations in the main creek channel of the estuary, while small cladocerans were more important at off-channel stations with reduced flushing. The results demonstrate the importance of rotifers and small r-selected cladocerans in the freshwater estuarine food web, where frequent flushing and intense fish predation may suppress large herbivores.																			0003-9136					JUL	1991	122	1					1	22																WOS:A1991GE95000001

Thirty-one pairs with broods were located, 9 in 1991, 22 in 1992. Brood size ranged from 2 to 10, with 4 and 5 being the most frequent. Brood size averaged 4.9 at hatching and 3.1 at fledging, a value which compares with that of rapidly expanding populations in Europe. Aerial surveys in fall at Long Point revealed a peak total of 148 in 1991 and 172 in 1992, an increase of 14 %. A high proportion of ''Polish'' morph juveniles were detected.																			0008-3550					JUL-SEP	1993	107	3					354	356																WOS:A1993NV54200015
J	HAVENS, KE				HAVENS, KE			LITTORAL ZOOPLANKTON RESPONSES TO ACID AND ALUMINUM STRESS DURING SHORT-TERM LABORATORY BIOASSAYS	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												During autumn 1990, littoral zooplankton were collected from three alkaline lakes in Ohio, USA. Toxicity tests were performed, in which animals were placed into treatments of pH 4.5, with or without 500-mu-g litre-1 Al added. Percentage survival after 24 h was determined for each test species, and compared to survival in controls (pH roughly 8.0). Three distinct responses were observed: (1) Four cladocerans, Simocephalus serrulatus, Diaphanosoma birgii, Acantholeberis curvirostris and Chydorus sphaericus, were tolerant of both acid and Al, with no significant reductions in survival in the treatments. (2) The cladoceran Eurycercus lamellatus and the copepod Acanthocyclops vernalis were sensitive to both acid and Al, and suffered 100% mortality in both treatments. (3) The cladocerans Camptocercus rectirostris, Alona costata and Pleuroxus denticulatus, and the copopod Mesocyclops edax showed decreased survival in the acid treatment, and a significantly greater decrease in the acid plus Al treatment. For nine of the ten test species, the results were consistent with previous survey and paleolimnological studies. The results indicate that direct toxic effects of H+ and Al ions largely determine the responses of these common littoral species to acidification.																			0269-7491						1991	73	1					71	84		10.1016/0269-7491(91)90097-G	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0269-7491(91)90097-G								15092092					WOS:A1991GA56900006

Expansion of supraglacial lake area, volume and extent on the Greenland ice sheet from 1985 to 2023	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Supraglacial lakes (SGLs) are widespread across the Greenland ice sheet and cause transient changes in ice flow. Here, we produce the first annual ice-sheet wide database of maximum summer SGL extents spanning 1985 to 2023 using all July and August Landsat images. Lake visibility percentages were calculated to estimate the uncertainty induced by variable image data coverage. SGLs were mainly distributed between 1000 and 1600 m elevation, with large lake area observed in northwestern, northeastern and southwestern basins. Lake area increased at a rate of 50.5 km(2) a(-1) across the entire Greenland, and lakes advanced to higher elevations at an average rate of 10.2 m a(-1) during 1985-2023. We leveraged spatiotemporally matched ICESat-2 and Landsat 8 reflectance data to develop a deep learning model for lake depth inversion for the period 2014-23. This model demonstrates the highest accuracy among all image-based methods, albeit with an underestimation of similar to 15% when compared to ICESat-2 data. A significant positive correlation between lake volume and area is used to up-scale the approach to the entire time period, indicating a lake volume increase of 221.9 +/- 63.6 x 10(6) m(3) a(-1). Increasing air/land surface temperature, surface pressure and decreasing snowfall were the most important contributing factors in driving lake variability.					; luo, lanhua/GRX-5389-2022; Lea, James/N-5699-2015	Livingstone, Stephen/0000-0002-7240-5037; 													0022-1430	1727-5652				NOV 6	2024	71								e4	10.1017/jog.2024.87	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jog.2024.87													WOS:001396840700001

Catherine			Hydroclimatic variability across the international Lake of the Woods watershed: Implications for nutrient export and climate sensitivity	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Characterizing streamflow and relationships with climate and watershed characteristics is an essential first step in the design of any monitoring program to assess basin response to changes in land use or cli-mate. This is especially true for the international Lake of the Woods watershed, where recurrent algae blooms have been associated with nutrient inputs from the watershed and climate warming. Here, we present a basin-wide hydroclimatic analysis within the sparsely monitored Canadian portion of the basin. Spatial and temporal patterns in climate and runoff were assessed across the two major geo-zones: the Precambrian 'Shield zone', dominated by bedrock, forests and lakes, and the poorly drained 'Agassiz zone' where ditching and drainage for agriculture have substantially enhanced the hydrologic connectivity. While climate conditions were consistent across the watershed, Agassiz basins were flashy, highly vari-able, and more seasonal compared with Shield rivers, likely due to the moderating effect of lake storage in the Shield region. Temperatures increased across the basin (1910-2010), and there was more rainfall and runoff during the ice-covered months (Nov-Mar), suggesting a shift toward earlier snowmelt. Marked seasonality and large swings in flow extremes at the Agassiz rivers suggest this region is particularly sen-sitive to hydroclimatic change and that frequent monitoring is needed to capture important periods of nutrient export like spring runoff and storm events. In contrast, substantial storage within the Shield landscape suggests this zone is more hydrologically 'resilient' to climate extremes and that water quality and quantity measurements can be less frequent.& COPY; 2022 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

The source and enrichment mechanisms of lithium in salt lakes are fundamental to uncovering the genesis of brine-type lithium deposits. However, the origin of lithium in salt lakes has been controversial, especially for lithium-rich brines associated with hard rock lithium ore has not been concerned by scholars. In this study, for the first time, we investigated the lithium isotope and hydrochemical composition characteristics of a lithium-rich salt lake (Kushui Lake) and a series of surrounding water samples in the lithium pegmatites district of West Kunlun, Xinjiang, China. Hydrochemical composition shows that different samples in the basin are rich in Li, Na, and K and poor in Mg and Ca. The water chemistry of the Kushui River, the largest river within the catchment, changes from carbonate type to sulfate subtype through evaporation. The precipitate of sulfate and chloride minerals is also gradually increasing.In addition, Li, B, Sr, Rb, Cs, U, Ti, V, Mn, Cu, Zn, Cr, Co, Ni, and REE are abnormally enriched in the rivers and lakes of the basin, especially in the spring water, which is several times higher than in the rivers. Likewise, dissolved Li and 87Li showed ranges of 0.01-287.86 mg/L and 3.28-16.44 parts per thousand, respectively. These data were used to determine the origin of lithium and its enrichment process in salt lakes. The results show that the source of Li in Kushui Lake is closely related to the surrounding felsic volcanic rocks, pegmatite-type lithium ore and deep fluids, whereas the water-rock interaction in the deep crust and the chemical weathering in the supergene environment play an influential role during the formation of Li-rich fluids. In addition, the spring samples in the northwestern of Kushui Lake have inherited the lithium isotopic signature of lithium-bearing source rocks from the water-rock reaction process in the deep crust, allowing us further to isolate the source of Li in the target waters. With the movement of water, lithium exhibits a trend of continuous enrichment under the influence of evaporation and mixing. At different stages of evaporation, the Li/Na ratio in water in this catchment shows a trend of increasing, decreasing, and increasing due to the adsorption of 6Li by secondary minerals and the crystallization of Na. It suggests that strong evaporation under arid conditions is the main mechanism responsible for the rapid enrichment of Li in salt lakes. Moreover, the positive relationship between Li content and the 87Li value of rivers along the discharge path indicated that the adsorption of 6Li by secondary minerals still existed even at a minor watershed scale, resulting in the fractionation of lithium isotopes in river waters. This study may contribute to a deeper understanding of lithium sources and their enrichment processes in Li-rich salt lakes. In addition, it is also beneficial to search for new lithium resources based on the source relationships among the various lithium reservoirs.

Here we studied whether the results of specific experiments made in a small pond with very high concentration of allochthonous organic matter could be verified by simple, but robust, basic environmental parameters measured in the field. In summer primary production of phytoplankton could explain only ca. 20% of epilimnetic respiration and < 10% of the nutritional requirements of zooplankton. These results agree with those of earlier experimental approaches and unequivocally suggest the major role played by allochthonous nutrition for the plankton in this pond. The roles played by photochemical degradation and anaerobic processes in the transformation of humic compounds available to epilimnetic food web in particular deserve further elucidation.																			0018-8158					JUL 15	2005	543						181	189		10.1007/s10750-004-6956-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-004-6956-7													WOS:000231958400015

Late Holocene vegetation and ocean variability in the Gulf of Oman	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Fossil pollen and dinocyst records in marine sequences are frequently combined to reveal the response of vegetation and ocean conditions to changes in both regional and global climate. In this study we analysed pollen and dinocysts within a clearly-laminated sediment core off the Iranian coast in the Gulf of Oman, an extremely data-poor area, to reconstruct climatic change during the Late Holocene (last 1900 years). The vegetation record from southern Iran indicates a replacement of savannah by desert formations at c. 910 CE, shortly after the Islamic invasion and the subsequent collapse of the Sassanid Empire. From c. 910 to 1145 CE, during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), the vegetation was heavily dominated by desert formations, such as Amaranthaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Asteraceae, Centaurea and Calligonum. In parallel, in the Gulf of Oman, the presence of Impagidinium paradoxum indicates a lack of freshwater discharge into the ocean around this time. The desert taxa of the MCA were subsequently replaced by savannah formations at c. 1145 CE, comprised mainly of Poaceae and Cyperaceae, corresponding to the Little Ice Age (LIA), indicating generally wetter climatic conditions. A sudden increase in Spiniferites ramosus (1-63%), at c. 1440 CE suggests an increase in the strength of the SW summer monsoon, with increased freshwater discharge into the ocean at this time. Our data indicate that over the past two millennia the NW Arabian Sea region has alternated between contrasting climatic conditions, with firstly a humid phase equivalent to the cultural period of the Sassanid Empire, a significantly drier climate during the MCA and a relatively wetter climate during the LIA. The mechanisms resulting in dry conditions during the MCA in the Middle East associated with the northward shift of the ITCZ and the intensification of the Indian summer monsoon may be similar to those causing the dry conditions which dominated the Early Holocene in the Near East. Our palaeoenvironmental proxy data support current observations that a globally anthropogenically-induced warmer climate is likely to lead to increased drought severity in the Middle East, putting additional stress on governments already struggling with poverty and social tensions.

Four types of pollution sources, including the estuary of Taihu Lake, discharge outlets of urban wastewater treatment plants, stormwater outlets, and nonpoint source agricultural drainage areas, were chosen, and next-generation sequencing and multivariate statistical analyses were used to characterize the microbial communities and reveal their relationship with water physicochemical properties. The results showed that ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) were the main pollutants in Changxing River, especially at stormwater outlets. At the same time, the diversity of microbial communities was the highest in the summer, and dominant microbes included Proteobacteria (40.9%), Bacteroidetes (21.0%), and Euryarchaeota (6.1%). The results of BIOENV analysis showed that the major seasonal differences in the diversity of microbial community of Changxing river were explained by the combination of water temperature (T), air pressure (P), TP, and CODMn. From the perspective of different pollution types, relative abundances of Microcystis and Nostocaceae at the estuary of Taihu Lake were correlated positively with dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH, and relative abundances of Pseudomonas and Arcobacter were correlated positively with concentrations of TN and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) at stormwater outlets. This study provided a reference for the impact of pollution types on river microbial ecosystem under complex hydrological conditions and guidance for the selection of restoration techniques for polluted rivers entering the important lake.					; zhang, yajie/GVT-3956-2022	Li, Mengyan/0000-0002-7664-4836; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2022	29	42					63722	63734		10.1007/s11356-022-19023-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19023-2		APR 2022						35460482					WOS:000785939700020

Waterfall formation at a desert river-reservoir delta isolates endangered fishes	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Unforeseen interactions of dams and declining water availability have formed new obstacles to recovering endemic and endangered big-river fishes. During a recent trend of drying climate and declining reservoir water levels in the Southwestern United States, a large waterfall has formed on two separate occasions (1989-1995 and 2001-present) in the transition zone between the San Juan River and Lake Powell reservoir because of deposited sediments. Since recovery plans for two large-bodied endangered fish species, razorback sucker (Xyrauchen texanus) and Colorado pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus lucius), include annual stockings in the San Juan River, this waterfall potentially blocks upstream movement of individuals that moved downstream from the river into the reservoir. To quantify the temporal variation in abundance of endangered fishes aggregating downstream of the waterfall and determine population demographics, we remotely monitored and sampled in spring 2015, 2016, and 2017 when these fish were thought to move upstream to spawn. Additionally, we used an open population model applied to tagged fish detected in 2017 to estimate population sizes. Colorado pikeminnow were so infrequently encountered (<30 individuals) that population estimates were not performed. Razorback sucker captures from sampling (335), and detections from remote monitoring (943) showed high abundance across all 3years. The razorback sucker population estimate for 2017 alone was 755 individuals and, relative to recent population estimates ranging from similar to 2,000 to similar to 4,000 individuals, suggests that a substantial population exists seasonally downstream of this barrier. Barriers to fish movement in rivers above reservoirs are not unique; thus, the formation of this waterfall exemplifies how water development and hydrology can interact to cause unforeseen changes to a riverscape.

Species traits modify the species-area relationship in ground-beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) assemblages on islands in a boreal lake	PLOS ONE												Life-history traits influence colonization, persistence, and extinction of species on islands and are important aspects of theories predicting the geographical distribution and evolution of species. We used data collected from a large freshwater lake (1,413 km 2) in central Canada to test the effects of island area and isolation on species richness and abundance of carabid beetles as a function of body size, wing length, and breeding season. A total of 10,018 individual beetles from 37 species were collected during the frost-free period of 2013 using transects of pitfall traps on 30 forested islands ranging in area from 0.2 to 980.7 ha. Life-history traits improved the predictive ability and significantly modified the shape of species- area and abundance-area curves. Abundance and richness of small-bodied (< 13.9 mm), macropterous (winged), and spring-breeding species decreased with island area and increased with isolation. In contrast, richness and abundance of larger-bodied (> 14.0 mm) and flightless species increased with area, but not isolation. Body size of female Carabus taedatus Fabricius, the largest-bodied species, was positively related to island area, while body size on the adjacent mainland was most similar to that on smaller islands. Overall, species with large body size and low dispersal ability, as indicated by flightlessness, were most sensitive to reductions in area. We suggest that large-bodied, flightless species are rare on small islands because habitat is less suitable for them and immigration rates are lower because they depend on freshwater drift for dispersal to islands.

The District operates these reservoirs to reduce flood flows into the Fort Worth Floodway, a 27-mile stretch of the West Fork of the Trinity River located in Fort Worth. In addition, TRWD operates 32 sumps along the Floodway. TRWD uses a decision support system-Aviso FS-to make operational decisions using forecasted runoff from observed precipitation. The use of this DSS enhances reservoir operators' abilities to evaluate and meet competing objectives regarding lake levels and downstream releases. This paper describes TRWD's use of Aviso FS during a flood event in Spring 2016 to minimize the flood's impacts on people and infrastructure.																					978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							584	594																WOS:000404786200050

Seasonal zooplankton dynamics in Lake Michigan: Disentangling impacts of resource limitation, ecosystem engineering, and predation during a critical ecosystem transition	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We examined seasonal dynamics of zooplankton at an offshore station in Lake Michigan from 1994 to 2003 and 2007 to 2008. This period saw variable weather, declines in planktivorous fish abundance, the introduction and expansion of dreissenid mussels, and a slow decline in total phosphorus concentrations. After the major expansion of mussels into deep water (2007-2008), chlorophyll in spring declined sharply, Secchi depth increased markedly in all seasons, and planktivorous fish biomass declined to record-low levels. Overlaying these dramatic ecosystem-level changes, the zooplankton community exhibited complex seasonal dynamics between 1994-2003 and 2007-2008. Phenology of the zooplankton maximum was affected by onset of thermal stratification, but there was no other discernable effect due to temperature. Interannual variability in zooplankton biomass during 1994 and 2003 was strongly driven by planktivorous fish abundance, particularly age-0 and age-1 alewives. In 2007-2008, there were large decreases in Diacyclops thomasi and Daphnia mendotae possibly caused by food limitation as well as increased predation and indirect negative effects from increases in Bythotrephes longimanus abundance and in foraging efficiency associated with increased light penetration. The Bythotrephes increase was likely driven in part by decreased predation from yearling and older alewife. While there was a major decrease in epilimnetic-metalimnetic herbivorous cladocerans in 2007-2008, there was an increase in large omnivorous and predacious calanoid copepods, especially those in the hypolimnion. Thus, changes to the zooplankton community are the result of cascading, synergistic interactions, including a shift from vertebrate to invertebrate planktivory and mussel ecosystem impacts on light climate and chlorophyll.

It showed how the importance of different scales in distance changed during the summer bloom of Gloeotrichia echinulata in the moderately eutrophic and stratified Lake Erken in southeastern Sweden. G. echinulata colonies occurred in patches at a distance of similar to 1000 m and the variance at smaller scales was low. For colony content of phosphorus, chlorophyll a and size, however, the largest variances were found at the 20 m (and error) scale if the variances between dates are not taken into account. It was concluded that in order to estimate the lake population of cyanobacterial colonies properly these variances must be considered when deciding the sampling program.																			0273-1223						1995	32	4					139	142		10.1016/0273-1223(95)00690-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0273-1223(95)00690-7													WOS:A1995TP50500017

Larval coregonids are vulnerable to the recently enhanced UV levels because immediately after hatching in spring they show a distinct positive phototaxis. The behavior of three size groups of vendace (Coregonus albula (L.)) and whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus (L.) s.l.) larvae were studied under enhanced UV-B irradiation in the laboratory. In addition, field data from four coregonid lakes in Finland were analysed. Coregonid larvae avoided UV radiation both in the laboratory and field. The smallest vendace larvae were the most sensitive to changes in UV irradiation in the laboratory experiments. In the field, the avoidance behaviour was more pronounced in lakes with low dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations than in a lake with a high DOC concentration.					; Karjalainen, Juha/B-4079-2015	Huuskonen, Hannu/0000-0001-5609-768X; Karjalainen, Juha/0000-0001-9302-1174													0003-455X	1797-2450				FEB 26	2004	41	1					89	98																WOS:000220364300011
J	Shaposhnikova, M; Duguay, C; Roy-Leveillee, P				Shaposhnikova, Maria; Duguay, Claude; Roy-Leveillee, Pascale			Bedfast and floating-ice dynamics of thermokarst lakes using a temporal deep-learning mapping approach: case study of the Old Crow Flats, Yukon, Canada	CRYOSPHERE												In light of the recent climate warming, monitoring of lake ice in Arctic and subarctic regions is becoming increasingly important. Many shallow Arctic lakes and ponds of thermokarst origin freeze to the bed in the winter months, maintaining the underlying permafrost in its frozen state. However, as air temperatures rise and precipitation increases, fewer lakes are expected to develop bedfast ice. In this work, we propose a novel temporal deep-learning approach to lake ice regime mapping from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and employ it to study lake ice dynamics in the Old Crow Flats (OCF), Yukon, Canada, over the 1992/1993 to 2020/2021 period. We utilized a combination of Sentinel-1, ERS-1 and ERS-2, and RADARSAT-1 to create an extensive annotated dataset of SAR time series labeled as either bedfast ice, floating ice, or land, which was used to train a temporal convolutional neural network (TempCNN). The trained TempCNN, in turn, allowed us to automatically map lake ice regimes. The classified maps aligned well with the available field measurements and ice thickness simulations obtained with a thermodynamic lake ice model. Reaching a mean overall classification accuracy of 95 %, the TempCNN was determined to be suitable for automated lake ice regime classification. The fraction of bedfast ice in the OCF increased by 11 % over the 29-year period of analysis. Findings suggest that the OCF lake ice dynamics are dominated by lake drainage events, brought on by thermokarst processes accelerated by climate warming, and fluctuations in water level and winter snowfall. Catastrophic drainage and lowered water levels cause surface water area and lake depth to decrease and lake ice to often transition from floating to bedfast ice, while a reduction in snowfall allows for the growth of thicker ice. The proposed lake ice regime mapping approach allowed us to assess the combined impacts of warming, drainage, and changing precipitation patterns on transitions between bedfast and floating-ice regimes, which is crucial to understanding evolving permafrost dynamics beneath shallow lakes and drained basins in thermokarst lowlands such as the OCF.					; Shaposhnikov, Mikhail/AGC-4720-2022; Shaposhnikov, Mikhail/M-7514-2013; Duguay, Claude/G-5682-2011	Duguay, Claude/0000-0002-1044-5850; Shaposhnikov, Mikhail/0000-0002-4625-6488; 													1994-0416	1994-0424				APR 19	2023	17	4					1697	1721		10.5194/tc-17-1697-2023	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1697-2023													WOS:000974870800001

The models were based on observational and experimental research, and the goals were used to evaluate alternative restoration plans. Results were integrated with those from several other parts of the regional system. A best overall plan was selected, and the United States Congress authorized the CERP in 2000. In Lake Okeechobee, the CERP is expected to reduce the occurrence of damaging high and low water levels, and increase the occurrence of spring water level recessions that benefit native biota. Ecosystem conceptual models will continue to be and used as a framework for long-term adaptive assessment during CERP implementation. The overall approach represents an effective integration of science and resource management.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				DEC	2002	18	4					285	292		10.1080/07438140209353934	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140209353934													WOS:000180154500003

Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis were used as standards of typical gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, respectively. A mounting agent to obtain clear images of Gram-stained bacteria on Nuclepore membrane filters was developed, The bacterial stainability by the Gram stain was indicated by the Gram stain index (GSI), which was applicable not only to the dichotomous classification of bacteria but also to the characterization of cell wall structure, The GSI spectra of natural bacterial populations in water with various levels of eutrophication showed a distinct profile, suggesting possible staining specificity that indicates the presence of a particular bacterial population in the aquatic environment.																			0099-2240					FEB	1998	64	2					742	747											9464416					WOS:000071858600056

Monotonic infrasound and Helmholtz resonance at Volcan Villarrica (Chile)	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Monotonic infrasound with stable peaked frequency of 0.77 Hz was recorded at Volcan Villarrica in January 2010. Similar monotonic infrasound had been previously reported at Villarrica (e. g., Ripepe et al. [2010]). Using joint infrasound and visual observations from a suspended camera we demonstrate that the likely source of infrasound is Helmholtz resonance produced from a cavity with volume 10(5) m(3) that separates the active convecting lava lake from an overhanging spatter roof. Spatter roof dimension (65 m diameter) and vent diameter (10 m) in the roof are constrained from video observations. Assuming a cylindrical cavity we infer a cavity height of 31 m that is corroborated by video records of spatter drips. The drips take as long as 2.2 s to fall from the roof into the lake, corresponding to a height of more than 24 m, which is in good agreement with the observed resonance frequency.

Temporal changes in the lake surface area have been analysed, using the Landsat satellite data. The nonparametric Mann-Kendall and Sen's methods were used to determine trends in hydrometeorological data. In addition, trends in extreme indices of frost days (FD), summer days, days with rainfall >10mm (R10), days with rainfall >20mm (R20) and dry spell for temperature and precipitation were also analysed. The results suggest an overall decrease in extreme rainfall events, R10 and R20, and annual precipitation pattern with increase in maximum and minimum annual average temperatures. Furthermore, the analysis of extreme temperature events suggests warming trend with increased number of warm days and decreased number of FD. With regard to water extent of the lake, an intense decreasing trend was observed.

This spring site, a small lake at the time of use (ad 300-800), has been investigated archaeologically from the late nineteenth century onwards. An impressive array of finds, including precious artefacts, is on display at the National Museum of Finland. However, the material has not previously been subjected to systematic research to clarify who these people were, and why they were buried in a small lake at a time when cremation was the prevailing burial tradition. Here we present the results of a multidisciplinary study that includes new analyses and interpretations of the finds and the site. Prestigious artefacts, peripheral location, and the fact that only a few males were found suggest this unusual burial site was a cemetery for socially or ideologically deviant members of the society.					; Wessman, Anna/AAL-6694-2021; Alenius, Teija/AAS-1906-2021; Vanhanen, Santeri/ABC-9234-2021	Vanhanen, Santeri/0000-0002-0101-8638; Holmqvist-Sipila, Elisabeth/0000-0002-7111-4625; Mannermaa, Kristiina/0000-0002-8510-1120; Wessman, Anna/0000-0001-6886-5455; alenius, teija/0000-0003-2965-5177; Perttola, Wesa/0000-0002-2199-7220													1461-9571	1741-2722				AUG	2018	21	3					431	454		10.1017/eaa.2017.84	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/eaa.2017.84													WOS:000440419400006

This study presents the first delta O-18 and delta D, and major ion contents of various waters (rain, rivers, lake, springs and wells) from Daihai Lake catchment on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). In combination with historical hydrological and meteorological data during the past 60 years, we investigate factors affecting water chemistry and lake evolution on the CLP, and thereby provide insight into hydrogeochemical processes under semi-arid climatic conditions. On the northeast CLP, river and groundwaters show elevated TDS (450 and 461 mg/L, respectively), about similar to 4 times higher than the global river mean value. Their water chemistry is dominantly influenced by carbonate weathering. Lake waters show even higher TDS at 5758 mg/L, similar to 50 times of the global mean, which is attributed to strong evaporation and associated with precipitation of calcite and dolomite. The order of carbonate (calcite and dolomite) saturation indexes follows lake water > river water > groundwater. Downstream rivers to the west of Daihai Like are characterized by elevated SO42-, indicating high lake levels in the past. Comparison of delta O-18, delta D, TDS and ion contents of river and groundwaters implies that shallow groundwaters are derived from surface runoff via fast infiltration, a hydrological process different from limited infiltration of groundwater on the Tibetan Plateau. Water quality assessment indicates that all river and 79% of well waters belong to moderately hard to hard-fresh waters, suitable for drinking and irrigation of plants with moderate salt tolerance. In contrast, all lake and spring waters and 21% of well waters belong to very bad water quality, and hence are not suitable for irrigation or drinking. Owing to intensified human activities under drying and warming climate, the lake water level of Daihai declined by 4.83 m from 1955 to 2003, and started to accelerate since 1980. As a result, TDS and Cl- increased by 1.8 times and Mg/Ca rose by 156 times from 1953 to 2010. Our data show that environment degradation poses a great threat to human occupation on the CLP. Considering the uniformity of loess, hydrogeochemical processes between surface and groundwaters on the loess regions may represent a widespread status of the CLP. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The melting point of the lipid of the planktonic cope-pods remained during the whole year somewhat lower than the water temperature. The proportions of the C20-C22 polyunsaturated acids in the planktonic crustaceans increased with decreasing temperature and in some species exceeded the values characteristic of marine animals.

Aluminum sulfate (alum) application interactions with coupled metal and nutrient cycling in a hypereutrophic lake ecosystem	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Many lake ecosystems worldwide experience severe eutrophication and associated harmful blooms of cyanobacteria due to high loadings of phosphorus (P). While aluminum sulfate (alum) has been used for decades as chemical treatment of eutrophic waters, the ecological effects of alum on coupled metal and nutrient cycling are not well known. The objective of our study was to investigate the effects of an in-situ alum treatment on aluminum and nutrient (P, N, and S) cycling in a hypereutrophic lake ecosystem. Our results indicate that the addition of alum along with sodium aluminate (as a buffer) increased dissolved aluminum and sulfate in the surface and pore waters, and altered nitrogen cycling by increasing nitrous oxide (N2O) concentrations in the surface water. The increase of aluminum and sulfate may potentially feedback to alter benthic community dynamics. These results enhance our understanding of the unintended ecological consequences of alum treatments in hypereutrophic freshwater ecosystems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In contrast, the surrounding freshwater fauna is commonly represented by species with large-scale distribution and high phenotypic thermal plasticity. Here, we investigated the thermal plasticity of the energy metabolism in two closely-related endemic amphipod species from Lake Baikal (Eulimnogammarus verrucosus; stenothermal and Eulimnogammarus cyaneus; eurythermal) and the ubiquitous Holarctic amphipod Gammarus lacustris (eurythermal) by exposure to a summer warming scenario (6-23.6 degrees C; 0.8 degrees C d(-1)). In concert with routine metabolic rates, activities of key metabolic enzymes increased strongly with temperature up to 15 degrees C in E. verrucosus, whereupon they leveled off (except for lactate dehydrogenase). In contrast, exponential increases were seen in E. cyaneus and G. lacustris throughout the thermal trial (Q(10)-values: 1.6-3.7). Cytochrome-c-oxidase, lactate dehydrogenase, and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities were found to be higher in G. lacustris than in E. cyaneus, especially at the highest experimental temperature (23.6 degrees C). Decreasing gene expression levels revealed some thermal compensation in E. cyaneus but not in G. lacustris. In all species, shifts in enzyme activities favored glycolytic energy generation in the warmth. The congruent temperature-dependencies of enzyme activities and routine metabolism in E. verrucosus indicate a strong feedback-regulation of enzymatic activities by whole organism responses. The species-specific thermal reaction norms reflect the different ecological niches, including the spatial distribution, distinct thermal behavior such as temperature-dependent migration, movement activity, and mating season.					; Stadler, Peter/L-7857-2015; Pörtner, Hans-O./ISU-9397-2023; Bedulina, Daria/E-6976-2012; Drozdova, Polina/H-9490-2013; Lucassen, Magnus/E-8433-2011; Axenov-Gribanov, Denis/F-7360-2017; Gurkov, Anton/M-8708-2014; Timofeyev, Maxim/F-2071-2010; Luckenbach, Till/G-6482-2015; Vereshchagina, Kseniya/R-7060-2016; Stadler, Peter F./L-7857-2015; Rivarola-Duarte, Dr. Lorena/G-5127-2012	Lucassen, Magnus/0000-0003-4276-4781; Gurkov, Anton/0000-0002-8390-1570; Luckenbach, Till/0000-0001-6204-1033; Stadler, Peter F./0000-0002-5016-5191; 													2045-2322					FEB 25	2021	11	1							4562	10.1038/s41598-021-83748-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-83748-2								33633174					WOS:000626620700003

Alice			Long-term field measurements of climate-induced thaw subsidence above ice wedges on hillslopes, western Arctic Canada	PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES												Near-surface wedges of massive ice commonly outline polygons in tundra lowlands, but such polygons have been difficult to identify on hillslopes because soil movement flattens the ridges and infills the troughs that form beside and above the ice wedges. Over the past three decades, the active layer has thickened near the western Arctic coast of Canada and consequent thawing of ice wedges has been detected by remote sensing for flat terrain but not, generally, on hillslopes. Annual field surveys (1996-2018) at the Illisarvik field site of thaw depth and ground surface elevation show the mean subsidence rate above hillslope ice wedges has been up to 32 mm a(-1) since thaw depth reached the ice-wedge tops in 2007. Annual mean ground temperatures at the site are about -3.0 degrees C beneath late-winter snow depths characteristic of the ice-wedge troughs but about -5.3 degrees C under conditions of the intervening polygons. The rate of thaw subsidence is high for natural, subaerial disturbances because meltwater from the ice wedges runs off downslope. The rate is constant, because the thickness of seasonally thawed ground above the ice wedges and the ice content of the ground remain the same while the troughs develop. Observations of changes in surface elevation in northern Banks Island between the late 1970s and 2019 show troughs on hillslopes where none was previously visible. Development of these troughs creates regional thermokarst landscapes, distinct from the widely recognized results of thawing relict glacier ice, that are now widespread over Canada's western Arctic coastlands. Recognition of ice-wedge occurrence and accelerated thaw subsidence on hillslopes is important in the design of infrastructure proposed for construction in rolling permafrost terrain.

The image stitching process is mostly utilized to capture an image of an entire object, whose parts fall in separate but overlapping mosaics. Due to their high resolutions and huge sizes, the stitching of satellite mosaic images is time- and resource-consuming process. The work presented in this paper proposes a resource- and content-aware, scalable stitching technique. The main idea is based on measuring and assessing the available hardware resources of the machine, on which stitching process runs, and scaling the resolution of the images accordingly. Moreover, preprocessing is not needed, and the adjustment is performed dynamically at run time. The effectiveness of the proposed technique was assessed by partially registering overlapping satellite mosaic images of the island of Cyprus and Lake Van. The scalability tests are performed on varying numbers and sizes of the overlapping LandSat-8 satellite images.

Lake-Effect Thunderstorms in the Lower Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning, radar, and radiosonde data were examined to determine how frequently lake-effect storms (rain/snow) with lightning occurred over and near the lower Great Lakes region (Lakes Erie and Ontario) from September 1995 through March 2007. On average, lake-effect lightning occurred on 7.9 days and with 5.8 storm events during a particular cool season (September-March). The CG lightning with these storms had little inland extent and was usually limited to a few flashes per storm. Some storms had considerably more, with the most intense storm (based on National Lightning Detection Network observations) producing 1551 CG flashes over a 4-day period. Thundersnow events were examined in more detail because of the rarity of this phenomenon across the United States. Most lake-effect thundersnow events (75%) occurred in November and December. An analysis of model sounding data using the Buffalo Toolkit for Lake Effect Snow (BUFKIT) software package in which lower boundary conditions can be modified by lake surfaces showed that thundersnow events had an 82% increase in the mean height of the -10 degrees C level when compared with nonelectrified lake-effect snowstorms (1.2 vs 0.7 km AGL), had higher lake-induced equilibrium levels (EL; above 3.6 km AGL) and convective available potential energy (CAPE; > 500 J kg(-1)), had low wind shear environments, and were intense, single-band storms. A nomogram of the altitude of the -10 degrees C isotherm and EL proved to be useful in predicting lake-effect thundersnowstorms.					; Orville, Richard/G-9866-2012	Keeler, Jason/0000-0001-7812-882X; 													1558-8424					MAY	2009	48	5					889	902		10.1175/2008JAMC1935.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2008JAMC1935.1													WOS:000266538100001

In the beginning of August 2001, 4 juvenile birds were observed. These birds were too young to fly. After searching the shoreline for nests, a group of 40 nests were discovered. Assuming that the four juvenile birds seen in the salt lake were produced from the observed 40 nest, the hatching success of eggs laid was estimated approximately 10%.

Recreation and Radial Growth of Pine Forests of the Natural Monument "Lake Turgoyak", Southern Urals	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The study presents results of the influence of recreational impact on the radial growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in old-growth stands at the sites with the V stage of recreational degradation on the territory of organized and unorganized recreation and undisturbed areas. Over the 100 years, no negative recreation-driven changes in the radial growth were found. There is a significant increase in the tree-ring width and the number of absent rings in the chronologies from active recreation sites. A linear relationship was found between the number of absent rings and Palmer's drought severity index. Under summer drought conditions, lake proximity may mitigate the negative effects of recreation on stands even at sites with V stage of recreational degradation.

Daphnia pulicaria and Daphnia galeata mendotae were particularly infested (mean maximum diatom density, 22,900 cells animal-1). Laboratory experiments revealed that infested Daphnia had greater sinking and filtering rates than uninfested animals. Respiration rates were not significantly different between the two groups. Field-collected animals were counted and scored for degree of infestation, number of eggs, and total body size. Abundance of both adult and immature Daphnia increased only after the epibiont no longer infested Daphnia. Clutch size was not significantly different between infested and uninfested Daphnia, but death rates were higher during the period of infestation. This increased mortality is attributed to added stress on individuals caused by the epibiont, demonstrating the translation of physiological effects into population level consequences.

J	KORTELAINEN, P; MANNIO, J				KORTELAINEN, P; MANNIO, J			NATURAL AND ANTHROPOGENIC ACIDITY SOURCES FOR FINNISH LAKES	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The headwater lakes in peat-rich areas in Finland commonly have high organic matter concentrations and are surrounded by soils and bedrock poor in bases. As a result the organic acid load on the watercourses is generally high. The significance of the organic vs anthropogenic acidity in 78 moderately acid lakes (pH range 4.3 to 7.1, TOC range 0.6 to 33.9 mg L-1) was evaluated in areas receiving different levels of acid deposition. The lakes were sampled during autumn overturn, and their water quality (mean TOC = 10.9 mg L-1, mean pH = 5.9) represents rather well the average water quality in small lakes in Finland. According to the correlation and regression analyses, TOC is a better predictor of pH than non-marine sulfate. Base cation concentrations are important in determining the sensitivity of the lakes to organic and anthropogenic acidity. The highest minerogenic acid contribution is found in high-deposition areas, while the percent organic acid contribution is greater in low deposition areas although TOC levels are comparable in both areas. It would appear that the pH of humic lakes is determined to a greater extent by individual watershed characteristics than by their geographical location at the present atmospheric loadings received in Finland.

Circum-Mediterranean fire activity and climate changes during the mid-Holocene environmental transition (8500-2500 cal. BP)	HOLOCENE												A mid- to late-Holocene synthesis of fire activity from the Mediterranean basin explores the linkages among fire, climate variability and seasonality through several climatic and ecological transitions. Regional fire histories were created from 36 radiocarbon-dated sedimentary charcoal records, available from the Global Charcoal Database. During the mid-Holocene 'Thermal Maximum' around 7500-4500 cal. BP, charcoal records from the northern Mediterranean suggest an increase in fire while records from the southern Mediterranean indicate a decrease associated with wetter-than-present summers. A North-South partition between 40 degrees and 43 degrees N latitude is apparent in the central and western Mediterranean. Relatively abrupt changes in fire activity are observed c. 5500-5000 cal. BP. Records of Holocene fire activity appear sensitive to both orbitally forced climate changes and shorter-lived excursions which may be related to North Atlantic cold events, possibly modulated by an NAO-like climate mechanism. In cases where human-fire interactions have been documented, the regional coherency between fire occurrence and climate forcing suggests a dominant fire-climate relationship during the early-mid Holocene. The human influence on regional fire activity became increasingly important after c. 4000-3000 cal. BP. Results also suggest that: (1) teleconnections between the Mediterranean area and other climatic regions, in particular the North Atlantic and the low latitudes monsoon areas, influenced past fire activity; (2) gradual forcing, such as changes in orbital parameters, may have triggered abrupt shifts in fire activity; (3) regional fire reconstructions contradict former notions of a gradual (mid-to late-Holocene) aridification of the entire region due to climate and/or human activities and the importance of shorter-term events; (4) Mediterranean fire activity appears hightly sensitive to climate dynamics and thus could be considerably impacted by future climate changes.

NSF-IRES Lake Victoria Res	Bacterial community and cyanotoxin gene distribution of the Winam Gulf, Lake Victoria, Kenya	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS												The Winam Gulf (Kenya) is frequently impaired by cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cHABs) due to inadequate wastewater treatment and excess agricultural nutrient input. While phytoplankton in Lake Victoria have been characterized using morphological criteria, our aim is to identify potential toxin-producing cyanobacteria using molecular approaches. The Gulf was sampled over two successive summer seasons, and 16S and 18S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was performed. Additionally, key genes involved in production of cyanotoxins were examined by quantitative PCR. Bacterial communities were spatially variable, forming distinct clusters in line with regions of the Gulf. Taxa associated with diazotrophy were dominant near Homa Bay. On the eastern side, samples exhibited elevated cyrA abundances, indicating genetic capability of cylindrospermopsin synthesis. Indeed, near the Nyando River mouth in 2022, cyrA exceeded 10 million copies L-1 where there were more than 6000 Cylindrospermopsis spp. cells mL-1. In contrast, the southwestern region had elevated mcyE gene (microcystin synthesis) detections near Homa Bay where Microcystis and Dolichospermum spp. were observed. These findings show that within a relatively small embayment, composition and toxin synthesis potential of cHABs can vary dramatically. This underscores the need for multifaceted management approaches and frequent cyanotoxin monitoring to reduce human health impacts. This work identified cyanobacterial community and cyanotoxin gene distribution in the Winam Gulf, Lake Victoria, Kenya. Cyanobacterial communities clustered in line with different areas of the Gulf, while cyanotoxin gene concentrations varied between the eastern and western regions. The results of the study show that the potential of toxin synthesis and cyanobacteria taxa present vary dramatically within the Gulf. image					Bullerjahn, George/F-4428-2010; Ward, Christopher/NRY-8845-2025; McKay, Robert/P-3759-2017; Olokotum, Mark/HPE-3688-2023	Bullerjahn, George/0000-0001-5319-7896; Byrne, Aidan/0009-0001-8600-3784; Brown, Katelyn/0000-0002-8581-9490; Olokotum, Mark/0000-0002-2823-471X													1758-2229					JUN	2024	16	3							e13297	10.1111/1758-2229.13297	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.13297								38885952					WOS:001248147100001

The major aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between manganese and iron concentrations and other physical and chemical water parameters. The waters of SLP differed in terms of fractional composition of manganese and iron. Higher concentrations of total iron and manganese were observed in groundwaters (1645 mu gFe/dm(3), 949 mu gMn/dm(3)).

Evaluating the causes of eutrophication in waterways is essential for effective pollution prevention and control. Xiao Xingkai Lake is part of and connected to Xingkai (Khanka) Lake, a boundary lake between China and Russia. In this study, we investigated the spatio-temporal variabilities in water quality (i.e., dissolved oxygen (DO), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonium-nitrogen (NH4-N)) in Xiao Xingkai Lake, from 2012 to 2014, after which a Trophic Level Index was used to evaluate trophic status, in addition to the factors influencing water quality variation in the lake. The DO, TN, TP, COD and NH4-N concentrations were 0.44-15.57, 0.16-5.11, 0.01-0.45, 0.16-18.31, and 0.19-0.78 mg/L, respectively. Compared to the Environmental Quality Standards for surface water (GB 3838-2002) in China, the lake transitioned to an oligotrophic status in 2013 and 2014 from a mesotrophic status in 2012, TN and TP concentrations were the key factors influencing water quality of Xiao Xingkai Lake. Non-parametric test results showed that sampling time and sites had significant effects on water quality. Water quality was worse in summer and in tourism and aquaculture areas, followed by agricultural drainage areas. Furthermore, lake water trophic status fluctuated between medium eutrophic and light eutrophic status from September 2012 to September 2014, and was negatively correlated with water level. Water quality in tourism and aquaculture sites were medium eutrophic, while in agricultural areas were light eutrophic. According to the results, high water-level fluctuations and anthropogenic activities were the key factor driving variability in physicochemical parameters associated with water quality in Xiao Xingkai Lake.

Discovery of a hypersaline subglacial lake complex beneath Devon Ice Cap, Canadian Arctic	SCIENCE ADVANCES												Subglacial lakes are unique environments that, despite the extreme dark and cold conditions, have been shown to host microbial life. Many subglacial lakes have been discovered beneath the ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland, but no spatially isolated water body has been reported to be hypersaline. Weuse radio-echo sounding measurements to identify two subglacial lakes situated in bedrock troughs near the ice divide of Devon Ice Cap, Canadian Arctic. Modeled basal ice temperatures in the lake area are no higher than-10.5 degrees C, suggesting that these lakes consist of hypersaline water. This implication of hypersalinity is in agreement with the surrounding geology, which indicates that the subglacial lakes are situated within an evaporite-rich sediment unit containing a bedded salt sequence, which likely act as the solute source for the brine. Our results reveal the first evidence for subglacial lakes in the Canadian Arctic and the first hypersaline subglacial lakes reported to date. We conclude that these previously unknown hypersaline subglacial lakes may represent significant and largely isolated microbial habitats, and are compelling analogs for potential ice-covered brine lakes and lenses on planetary bodies across the solar system.					; Skidmore, Mark/I-4317-2018; Young, Duncan/G-6256-2010; Grima, Cyril/E-9800-2013; Rutishauser, Anja/AAP-1415-2021	Greenbaum, Jamin Stevens/0000-0002-0745-7113; Dowdeswell, Julian/0000-0003-1369-9482; Young, Duncan/0000-0002-6866-8176; Sharp, Martin/0000-0001-5299-7955; Rutishauser, Anja/0000-0002-1819-8014; Grima, Cyril/0000-0001-7135-3055; Schroeder, Dustin/0000-0003-1916-3929													2375-2548					APR	2018	4	4							eaar4353	10.1126/sciadv.aar4353	http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aar4353								29651462					WOS:000431374900053

(1983) for Finnish lakes. The database consisted of samples collected in the autumn of 1987 from 955 randomly selected lakes covering the whole country. Organic anion concentrations were estimated as the difference between SIGMA-cations and SIGMA-inorganic anions. The charge density of TOC was estimated by dividing the organic anion concentration by TOC. The median charge density was 7.5-mu-eq (mg TOC)-1. In lakes with pH values lower than 4.5 the average charge density was 5.2-mu-eq (mg TOC)-1 and it increased to 10.3-mu-eq (mg TOC)-1 in lakes with pH higher than or equal to 7.0. The calibrated model explained 79% of the observed variability in organic anion concentration. The value for the total amount of acidic functional groups per mol organic carbon in the model of Oliver et al. (1983) was slightly higher compared to the Finnish calibration. At pH values higher than 4.4 the Finnish calibration gives lower organic anion concentrations compared to the model of Oliver et al. (1983).					; Kortelainen, Pirkko/AAN-7045-2020	Kortelainen, Pirkko/0000-0002-1448-0688; 													0269-7491						1992	77	2-3					107	113		10.1016/0269-7491(92)90066-J	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0269-7491(92)90066-J								15091948					WOS:A1992JB64500003

Airborne bacteria confirm the pristine nature of the Southern Ocean boundary layer	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Microorganisms are ubiquitous and highly diverse in the atmosphere. Despite the potential impacts of airborne bacteria found in the lower atmosphere over the Southern Ocean (SO) on the ecology of Antarctica and on marine cloud phase, no previous region-wide assessment of bioaerosols over the SO has been reported. We conducted bacterial profiling of boundary layer shipboard aerosol samples obtained during an Austral summer research voyage, spanning 42.8 to 66.5 degrees S. Contrary to findings over global subtropical regions and the Northern Hemisphere, where transport of microorganisms from continents often controls airborne communities, the great majority of the bacteria detected in our samples were marine, based on taxonomy, back trajectories, and source tracking analysis. Further, the beta diversity of airborne bacterial communities varied with latitude and temperature, but not with other meteorological variables. Limited meridional airborne transport restricts southward community dispersal, isolating Antarctica and inhibiting microorganism and nutrient deposition from lower latitudes to these same regions. A consequence and implication for this region's marine boundary layer and the clouds that overtop it is that it is truly pristine, free from continental and anthropogenic influences, with the ocean as the dominant source controlling low-level concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei and ice nucleating particles.					; Uetake, Jun/V-4853-2018; Kreidenweis, Sonia/E-5993-2011; DeMott, Paul/C-4389-2011	Protat, Alain/0000-0002-8933-874X; Moore, Kathryn/0000-0002-9242-5422; Kreidenweis, Sonia/0000-0002-2561-2914; Hill, Thomas/0000-0002-5293-3959; DeMott, Paul/0000-0002-3719-1889													0027-8424					JUN 16	2020	117	24					13275	13282		10.1073/pnas.2000134117	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2000134117								32482865					WOS:000546040300023

The importance of "Deep" organic carbon in permafrost-affected soils of arctic Alaska	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Reporting characteristics for the upper 100 cm of the pedon is common for Gelisols and soil C budgets. The amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestered at a depth of 100 to 200 cm was determined for 29 permafrost-affected soils from northern Alaska. An average of 29 kg C m(-3) was present within the 100- to 200-cm depth interval, which is contained in the upper permafrost. For a 200-cm-deep profile, about 36% of the SOC pool occurs below 100 cm. From limited data, there were no significant differences in "deep" SOC levels among Histels, Turbels, and Orthels, the three suborders of Gelisols. Based on a previous survey of the Barrow Peninsula, permafrost-affected soils, contain 66.5 Tg of SOC in the upper 100 cm, and another 36 Tg in the 100- to 200-cm zone. This C pool is vulnerable to mobilization following warming and increased summer thaw depth in the arctic.																			0361-5995					NOV-DEC	2007	71	6					1889	1892		10.2136/sssaj2007.0070N	http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2007.0070N													WOS:000251092100027

The seasonal transition from light to phosphorus limitation was driven by the change in vertical mixing although this was most pronounced in midlake. Different trends in spring diatom biomass and nutrient deficiency between the two stations were caused by different mixing depths and the effect on the underwater light climate. Prior to thermal stratification, phytoplankton growth in the eastern basin was phosphorus- and silica-limited while light was the limiting factor in the midlake until stratification. <(I)over bar(lim)> the level of water column irradiance determining whether light was limiting phytoplankton growth, was estimated at 4-6 mE . m(-2). min(-1). <(I)over bar(lim)> occurred at a mixing depth of 38-50 m at the seasonal mean light attenuation of 0.30 m(-1) under cloudless conditions on June 21. Light-limiting ratios, the ratio of light supply ((I) over bar) to light demand as defined by I-k (irradiance defining the onset of light saturation of photosynthesis), were compared with seasonal trends in the phosphate deficiency index.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAY	1996	53	5					1112	1124		10.1139/f96-030	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f96-030													WOS:A1996VM91000015

The dominant alga of the lack (Peridinium cinctum f. westii), usually blooming from Jan.-May, developed 2 mo. later than in previous years. The small and short peak of diatoms and green algae, which used to appear in Jan., extended until March, delaying the appearance of the winter bloom. The replacement of the non-grazed Peridinium having a high C:P ratio by the actively grazed diatoms and green algae having a low C:P ratio led to a substantial decrease of algal standing crop in the water. The chain of limnological events leading to the biological modification is investigated and its bearing on water quality is discussed.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1977	54	1					73	80		10.1007/BF00018773	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00018773													WOS:A1977DH10800009
J	LaPerriere, JD				LaPerriere, JD			Limnology of Harding Lake, Alaska: A deep, subarctic lake	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Harding Lake (mean depth =16 m) located in Interior Alaska (64degrees25'N, 146degrees50'W), studied in the early 1970s in response to concerns about the impact of lakeshore development on water quality was sampled again in summer 1993 thereby providing comparative data over a 20-year period. The lake is usually dimictic butsome years stratification begins under the ice and the lake misses a re-oxgenating overturn. One-third of the annual heat budget of about 19,600 cal . cm(2) is taken up by melting the ice cover. The lake is the common calcium-bicarbonate type but is dilute due to its relatively small watershed and dominance of siliceous material in the local lithography. Based on Secchi transparency, plant nutrients and algal chlorophyll the lake is oligotrophic, with no evidence the lake has been enriched during the study period.

Epiphytic enzyme activity was greater per unit dry weight of E. canadensis, but was greater on P. australis when expressed on a plant surface area basis. The ranking of the enzymes assayed was the same on both host plants and in the pond water, i.e. phosphatase > beta-D-glucosidase > beta-D-galactosidase and beta-D-xylosidase > sulphatase. Values of epiphytic enzyme activity relative to activity in pond water were substantial enough to suggest that, at well vegetated sites, epiphytic enzyme activity should make up an appreciable proportion of whole-pond extracellular enzyme activity. Epiphytic enzyme activity on P. australis varied seasonally, with summer maxima, whereas there was no obvious seasonal periodicity on E. canadensis. Multiple-regression analysis suggested that enzyme activity on P. australis was potentially dependent on both epiphytic bacterial variables (metabolic activity and abundance) and characteristics of the surrounding water (pH and temperature). In contrast, enzyme activity on E. canadensis was apparently more dependent on surrounding water quality.																			0003-9136					DEC	1994	132	2					237	253																WOS:A1994QA25900008

Accipiter striatus, A. cooperii, A. gentilis, Circus cyaneus, Buteo jamaicensis, B. platypterus, Falco pelegrinus, F. columbarius, and Asio otus harbored both Leucocytozoon toddi and Haemoproteus. F. columbarius and Asio otus had only Leucocytozoon toddi, and one F. peregrinus was not infected. The prevalence of hematozoans was similar between ages classes of the sharp-shinned hawk (Accipiter striatus) and goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), but in the Cooper's hawk (Accipiter cooperii) immatures were more frequently infected than adults. There were no significant intersexual differences in infection rates for accipiters.																			1049-233X					JAN	1996	63	1					141	143																WOS:A1996TP95500028

Understanding shifting cues for walleye spawning phenology and recruitment in a changing climate	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Increased environmental variability driven by climate change threatens species adapted to seasonal climates. Understanding whether changing environmental cues influence life history phenology and the importance of environmental characteristics on recruitment could inform population vulnerability. We used a 57-year time series of walleye (Sander vitreus) spawning, adult abundance, age-0 recruitment, and environmental data from Escanaba Lake, Wisconsin, USA, to examine: (1) cues driving walleye spawning phenology; and (2) critical periods for age-0 walleye survival, including whether critical periods have changed over time. Walleye spawning was driven by an interaction between water temperature and photoperiod, potentially explaining previous research showing an inability of walleye to track increasingly early ice-off timing. We observed no consistent temperature or precipitation critical periods for walleye recruitment either in the full dataset, or when examining these relationships in different time periods. Our results suggests that walleye may be limited in their responsiveness to changing spring thermal environments owing to reliance on photoperiod cues, and their recruitment exhibits interannual context-dependencies, complicating attempts to accurately predict age-0 recruitment using predefined environmental variables.

N.; Stefanov, V., I			Lakeside Settlement of the Beginning of the Iron Age in the Ural Taiga	STRATUM PLUS												The article presents the characteristics of the multi-temporal settlements that existed in the 8th-3rd centuries BC on the ruins of Shaitanskoe Lake II, a unique sanctuary of the beginning of the Bronze Age in the vicinity of the village Neivo-Rudyanka, Sverdlovsk Region. This is the first most fully investigated (1149 sq.m) site of the early Iron Age of the mountain-forest Trans-Urals, located on a low lakeside terrace. The ceramic and tool complexes of the Gamayun culture, descendants of the taiga tribes of Western Siberia, who came from the north, as well as the communities of the local Itkur and heterogeneous Iset' cultures, characterize the inhabitants of the settlements as settled fishermen and hunters who were familiar with the basic producing economy (livestock maintenance, copper foundry). The absence of long-term stationary dwellings and a powerful cultural layer is typical for ancient seasonal summer camps and villages. The presence of a small amount of ceramics from Gorokhovo and Baitovo cultures documents forced relocation of a part of the population from the Tobol region into the Trans-Ural taiga in the 5th-3rd centuries BC, under the pressure of cattle-breeding tribes of the Sargat culture, ancient ancestors of the Hungarians, moving from the Ishim-Irtysh forest-steppe.

However, one should not forget about the biology behind the method. Almost always ignored is how the structure of this bacterial virus is assembled. In contrast to lytic phages, filamentous phages are constantly being extruded through the bacterial membranes without lysis. Such filamentous phages are found in all aquatic environments, such as rivers and lakes, in the deep sea, in arctic ice, in hot springs and, associated with their hosts, in plants and animals including humans. While most filamentous phages infect Gram-negative hosts, inoviruses of Gram-positive hosts have also been described. Despite being among the minority within the phage family with an estimate of less than 5%, filamentous phages are real parasites as they exist at the expense of the host, but do not kill it. In contrast to lytic bacteriophages, filamentous phages are assembled in the host's membrane and extruded across the cellular envelope while the bacterium continues to grow. In this review, we focus on this complex and yet poorly understood process of assembly and secretion of filamentous phages.

These processes are reflected in the country's dramatic scenery and a plethora of spectacular geosites. Ethiopia's geoheritage is well known to, and has been extensively studied by, earth scientists but is given little recognition by authorities within the country or by local communities and is not promoted to tourists. Many geosites such as the Tis Isat Falls on the Blue Nile, the lakes of the Rift Valley and even such iconic sites as the Dallol geothermal area are endangered, often by large-scale infrastructure, mineral extraction or agricultural projects. Historical heritage is recognised and valued in Ethiopia; historic sites are well protected and are the main drawcard for tourists visiting the country. Similar recognition of and respect for geoheritage could be promoted by education through geotourism, thus encouraging protection of geosites and their conservation for the future.

J	Salcher, MM; Pernthaler, J; Posch, T				Salcher, Michaela M.; Pernthaler, Jakob; Posch, Thomas			Seasonal bloom dynamics and ecophysiology of the freshwater sister clade of SAR11 bacteria 'that rule the waves' (LD12)	ISME JOURNAL												Alphaproteobacteria are common members of marine bacterioplankton assemblages, but are believed to be rare in lacustrine systems. However, uncultured Alphaproteobacteria of the freshwater LD12 lineage form a tight monophyletic sister group with the numerically dominant bacteria in marine epipelagic waters, the SAR11 clade or genus Pelagibacter. Comparative rRNA sequence analysis reveals a global occurrence of LD12 bacteria in freshwater systems. The association of genotypic subclades with single-study systems moreover suggests a regional diversification. LD12 bacteria exhibit distinct and annually recurring spatio-temporal distribution patterns in prealpine lakes, as assessed by seasonally resolved vertical profiling and high-throughput cell counting. During the summer months, these ultramicrobacteria can form cell densities in the surface (epilimnetic) water layers that are comparable to those of their marine counterparts (>5 x 10(8) cells per l). LD12 bacteria had a pronounced preference for glutamine and glutamate over 7 other amino acids in situ, and they exhibited substantially higher uptake of these two substrates (and glycine) than the microbial assemblage in general. In addition, members of LD12 were also able to exploit other monomeric sources of organic carbon such as glucose, fructose or acetate. LD12 seemed to follow an oligotrophic lifestyle with slow but efficient uptake already at low substrate concentrations. Thus, LD12 bacteria do not only share phenotypic and metabolic traits with Pelagibacter, but also seem to thrive in the analogous spatiotemporal niche in freshwaters. The two groups together form one of the rare monophyletic lineages of ultramicrobacteria that have successfully traversed the barrier between marine and freshwater habitats.

J	JUTTNER, F				JUTTNER, F			FLAVOR COMPOUNDS IN WEAKLY POLLUTED RIVERS AS A MEANS TO DIFFERENTIATE POLLUTION SOURCES	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The volatile organic compounds of eight weakly polluted small rivers and brooks in SW Germany were studied by GC-MS. Special emphasis was placed on the differentiation between biogenic and anthropogenic sources and the use of particular compounds or patterns of compounds to characterize the pollution sources. Mono- and sesquiterpenes, which were liberated by wood processing industries, could clearly be distinguished from those which came from odorants of household detergents. In nearly every water sample geosmin was present while 2-MIB was not found in a single case. Nor-carotenoids were frequently observed in all river waters. The seasonal occurrence (summer) of 3-butenylisothiocyanate in several river waters was unexpected. Experiments with rape plants and soil from rape fields showed that this compound is leached from rape. However, the source of methylisothiocyanate that notoriously occurred in one river could not be established (acarizide or biogenic). Different patterns of esters were used to differentiate between the discharge of a plant manufacturer and a sewage treatment plant. Linear and cyclic hydrocarbons could be divided into a biogenic and anthropogenic fraction. Alkyl benzenes were found only in those rivers which were affected by industrial activities.																			0273-1223	1996-9732					1992	25	2					155	164																WOS:A1992HR70900021

In the last decades, global warming and increasing aridity has led to an increase in both the number and severity of wildfires. This has a negative impact on lake catchments by reducing forest cover and triggering cascading effects in freshwater ecosystems. In this work we used satellite remote sensing to analyse potential fire effects on lake water quality of Lake Baikal (Russia), considering the role of runoff and sediment transport, a less studied pathway compared to fire emissions transport. The main objectives of this study were to analyse time series and investigate relationships among fires (i.e., burned area), meteo-climatic parameters and water quality variables (chlorophyll-a, turbidity) for the period 2003-2020. Because Lake Baikal is oligotrophic, we expected detectable changes in water quality variables at selected areas near the three mains tributaries (Upper Angara, Barguzin, Selenga) due to river transport of fire-derived burned material and nutrients. Time series analysis showed seasonal (from April to June) and inter-annual fire occurrence, precipitation patterns (high intensity in summer) and no significant temporal changes for water quality variables during the studied periods. The most severe wildfires occurred in 2003 with the highest burned area detected (36,767 km2). The three lake sub-basins investigated have shown to respond differently according to their morphology, land cover types and meteo-climatic conditions, indicating their importance in determining the response of water variables to the impact of fires. Overall, our finding suggests that Lake Baikal shows resilience in the medium-long term to potential effects of fires and climate change in the region.

Re-evaluation of the time frame for the onset of the species flock and identification of events that putatively influenced diversification processes. Location: Lake Ohrid, Balkan Peninsula, Europe. Taxon: Gammarus species flock (Amphipoda, Crustacea). Methods: Extensive sampling and DNA barcoding of 600 individuals was carried out. DNA sequences were analysed using species delimitation methods, haplotype network reconstructions, Bayesian molecular dating and demographic analyses. The COI-based species delimitation results were validated with nuclear 28S RNA data. Results: The species flock distribution has a weak horizontal but clear vertical structure. The diversity along bathymetric gradients correlates with temperature and salinity; and the highest diversity is observed in sublittoral and springs on the lake's shore. Two new molecular units representing putatively new species are revealed and supported also by the nuclear marker. The onset of flock radiation overlaps with the time of lake formation. The COI gene shows signs of positive selection and an acceleration in substitution rate. The demographic changes within the flock happened during the last thousands years. Main Conclusions: Distribution of the Gammarus species flock is vertically structured, reflecting habitat zonation. Parapatric speciation is one of the possible mechanisms behind the flock's diversification. Detection of new MOTUs suggests that the flock's diversity is still not fully revealed. Simultaneously, failure to collect three previously known MOTUs suggests a loss of gammarid diversity in the lake. This represents, together with the current threats to the lake ecosystem (i.e. climate changes, development of tourism), a clear call for conservation efforts. The speciation events and demographic changes within the flock relate presumably to glacial and postglacial water level changes and to the colonisation of new depth ranges and the associated springs.

For example, maximum postglacial summer temperatures at SML probably occurred 6000-4000 C-14 yr B.P., an age more in accordance with eastern than northeastern records. Larix arrived near the lake by 9600 C-14 yr B.P., approximately when forests expanded in the east but ca. 1500 C-14 yr later than forests were established in the neighboring upper Kolyma basin. Paleobotanical data further suggest that Larix possibly migrated southward from populations in the arctic lowlands of eastern Siberia and did not originate from interior refugia of the upper Kolyma basin. Although a Younger Dryas cooling has been noted in eastern Siberia, SML provides the first evidence from the northeast for a similar climatic reversal. Climatic variations seemingly have persisted between the Indigirka and Kolyma basins over at least the last 11,000 IT yr, despite the proximity of the two drainages and the occurrence of major changes in boundary conditions (e.g., seasonal insolation, sea levels) that have influenced other regional climatic patterns.

J	EDWARDS, TWD; FRITZ, P				EDWARDS, TWD; FRITZ, P			STABLE-ISOTOPE PALEOCLIMATE RECORDS FOR SOUTHERN ONTARIO, CANADA - COMPARISON OF RESULTS FROM MARL AND WOOD	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Profiles of .delta.18O in two marl cores from southern Ontario, Canada, are compared in detail with the records of meteoric water isotopic composition and photosynthetic humidity obtained from previous isotopic studies using wood cellulose at Brampton, Ontario. By accounting for the inferred changes in meteoric water composition and temperature, the changes in the oxygen-isotope content of the marl arising from fluctuations in the evaporative enrichment of the lakewater can be estimated. The resulting synthetic profiles of relative evaporative enrichment for both marl cores exhibit strong correspondence to the photosynthetic humidity profile generated from the studies at Brampton, which substantiates the importance of evaporation in the water budgets of these two lakes. A striking analogy exists beween the isotopic evaporative enrichment response of such lakewaters and that of the the waters in terrestrial plants; both of the marl lakes approach close to isotopic steady state during the summer season, when carbonate precipitation occurs. The results of these studies strengthen the basis for paleoclimatic interpretations suggested in previous reports. Most notably, the marl data yield further evidence for relatively dry conditions in southern Ontario during the early part of the Hypsithermal interval, at a time that coincides with maximum eastward extension of prairie in the midwest United States.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				SEP	1988	25	9					1397	1406		10.1139/e88-134	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e88-134													WOS:A1988Q831500006

In Oyster Pond, a highly productive coastal pond, average monthly concentrations of DCHO in surface water of the north basin varied from about 1.3 to 2.9 mg/liter between Feb. 1964 and April 1965. Lowest concentrations were found during phytoplankton blooms in Feb. The seasonal curve for DCHO in the morning was almost a mirror image of that for chlorophyll [alpha]. Concentrations of DCHO were greater in the afternoon than in the morning, but daily increases did not appear to be related to chlorophyll a concentrations. In the south basin, average monthly concentrations of DCHO increased during summer stagnation (April-Sept. 1964) from 1.5 to 4.2 mg/liter. A high concentration was associated with a bloom of the green bacterium Chlorobium. Concentrations of DCHO in Wequaquet Lake, a less productive body of freshwater, also changed seasonally but were always lower than in Oyster Pond. No DCHO was detected between April and Aug. in surface water in the morning, and the highest concentration (1.2 mg/liter) occurred in Feb. 1965.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1966	11	2					249	+		10.4319/lo.1966.11.2.0249	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1966.11.2.0249													WOS:A19667752500012

However, more subtle changes to the host may ensue when lesser quantities of pollutants are involved. Here, the resulting damage may include immunosuppression, physical damage to gills and epithelia, and adverse affects on metabolism. Also, there may well be increased susceptibility to various infectious diseases, including lymphocystis and ulceration.

The extent to which POPs persist in the environment and affect human health depends on accumulation in the different components of the zooplankton community such as particle feeders and/or predators and their subsequent consumption by fish, which varies seasonally. We analyzed ten-years (2011-2020) of seasonal data on POPs in the crustacean zooplankton community of Lake Maggiore (Italy). The concentration of total DDTs, as sum of all congeners ranged between 23.5 and 156.9 ng/g dry weight, while sumPCB14 ranged from 24.4 and 133.6 ng/g dry weight. We traced particle feeders' vs predatory taxa within the zooplankton community using carbon and nitrogen stable isotopic values. POPs concentration was significantly related to the nitrogen isotopic values. The zooplankton biomass increase in Spring was important, both through this being a period of increased metabolism and activity of planktivorous fish and also as it was the period when the zooplankton repository of POPs was at a maximum. DDTtot stocked in zooplankton >= 450 mu m was up to 275 ng/m2, while sumPCB14 was 285 ng/m2 in 2013. A decrease of DDTtot stocked in the zooplankton repository characterized the last five years examined, when mean annual values (14.8-56.9 ng/m2) were less than half those of the previous period (50.7-128.6 ng/m2).					; Boldrocchi, Ginevra/KSM-8483-2024; Bettinetti, Roberta/AAD-7072-2019	Boldrocchi, Ginevra/0000-0002-6827-4687; Bettinetti, Roberta/0000-0001-7481-6190; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				JAN 20	2023	857		2						159379	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159379	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159379		OCT 2022						36228801					WOS:000906909000011

Model strains Synechocystis PCC 6803 and Synechococcus elongates PCC 7942, as well as the strain isolated in the present work, Synechococcus sp. 55, were less toxic. Mass spectrometry made it possible to assign cyanobacterial toxins to cyclic depsipeptides. Two cyclic depsipeptides, micropeptin T and oscillapeptin, were detected in Desertifilum sp. extracts. Cryptophycin and small amounts of cyclic depsipeptide micropeptin SD were detected in Nostoc sp. extract.					; LOS, Dmitry/C-6608-2013; Zayadan, Bolatkhan/B-1664-2015; Nurziya, Akmukhanova/ABO-9683-2022; Sinetova, Maria/L-5684-2015; Bolatkhan, Kenzhegul/AAZ-8890-2020; Sadvakassova, Assemgul/X-6084-2019	Zayadan, Bolatkhan/0000-0002-4572-2416; Sadvakasova, Asem/0000-0003-1456-5320; Sinetova, Maria/0000-0001-9931-1762; 													0003-6838	1608-3024				DEC	2017	53	7					754	760		10.1134/S000368381707002X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S000368381707002X													WOS:000427058000002

Metazoan parasites of Alburnus chalcoides in Todurge Lake (Zara/Sivas, Turkey)	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												The metazoan parasites of the Danube bleak, Alburnus chalcoides (Guldenstadt, 1772), were determined in Todurge Lake, since the parasite fish fauna had not yet been studied in this system. A total of 106 specimens were collected from October 2004 to September 2005. Six parasite species were found: two monogeneans (Diplozoon paradoxum and Diplozoon megan), one digenean (Posthodiplostomum cuticola), one cestode (Bothriocephalus acheilognathi), one nematod (Rhabdochona sp.), and one copepod (Argulus foliaceus). About 87.7% of the Danube bleak examined were infected by at least one parasite: Rhabdochona sp. (4080 specimens), Posthodiplostomum cuticola (312 specimens) and Diplozoon megan (159 specimens) being the dominant parasites. Only 33% of the fish carried one parasitic species whilst the remainder had two (21.7%), three (17.9%) and four different species (15.1%). The frequency of infestation changed according to seasonal conditions, with a maximum 94.3% observed in spring. Occurrence, density, seasonal changes, and preferences of the parasites species for various ages and size groups of the bleak were identified, despite the limited overall sample size. D. paradoxum, D. megan, P. cuticola, B. acheilognathi, Rhabdochona sp. and A. foliaceus were determined for the first time as parasites of Danube bleak in Turkey. D. megan was also a new record for the fish parasite fauna of Turkey.

Total and antibiotic resistant coliform bacteria, enterococci and coagulase positive staphylococci were determined in 34 samples of surface water from rivers and still waters (dams, natural lakes, thermal bath) some of them used for recreational swimming. Sampling was performed during summer season 2017 (July and August). The number of total coliforms ranged from 1.74 log CFU/10 mL to 3.69 log CFU/10 mL. Coliform bacteria were registered in each tested sample. The highest number was observed in the sample from river Hron. Majority of samples contained ampicillin and tetracycline resistant bacteria. Enterococci were determined in 70 % of samples ranging from 0.78 log CFU/ 10 mL to 3.81 log CFU/ 10 mL. The highest number of enterococci was observed in river Vah. Ampicillin and vancomycin resistance prevailed over ciprofloxacin and gentamicin resistance. Coagulase positive staphylococci were present in 91 % of samples in the range of 0.70-3.03 log CFU/10 mL. Antibiotic resistant coagulase positive staphylococci were observed only in 32 % of samples, predominantly from rivers. In these samples, chloramphenicol resistance predominated. In three samples of water used for recreational purposes. the limit value for enterococci and E. coli according to Slovak legislation (Decree no. 308/2012 Coll.) for the quality of water in natural swimming pools during bathing season was exceeded.

J	Conrad, R; Claus, P; Casper, P				Conrad, Ralf; Claus, Peter; Casper, Peter			Stable isotope fractionation during the methanogenic degradation of organic matter in the sediment of an acidic bog lake, Lake Grosse Fuchskuhle	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Lake Grosse Fuchskuhle is an acidic bog lake, which develops an anoxic hypolimnion during the summer season, so that sediment organic matter is degraded anaerobically to CH4 and CO2. The delta C-13 values of organic matter and its degradation products were used for determination of the mass balance, degradation path, and fractionation factors. Addition of methyl fluoride, an inhibitor of acetoclastic methanogenesis, increasingly inhibited CH4 production and resulted in accumulation of acetate (and a little propionate), which then was an additional end product of organic matter degradation. The delta C-13 of acetate-methyl group was slightly lower than that of organic matter, indicating a small fractionation (about 4 parts per thousand) during the fermentative production of acetate. Chemolithotrophic acetogenesis was low (< 9%). The fraction of CH4 produced from hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was about 55-67%. After incubation for 20 h the average delta C-13 of the degradation products was similar to that of sediment organic matter, both in the absence and the presence of CH3F. The produced total inorganic carbon (TIC) was further converted to CH4 with apparent enrichment factors of 56-67 parts per thousand. The fraction of TIC that was actually converted to CH4 was calculated to be about 33% and 23% in the absence and presence of CH3F, respectively. These data are consistent with the assumption that about half of the organic matter was incompletely degraded, resulting in the production of only CO2 and H-2, afterward converted to CH4. The data further show that the reduction of CO2 to CH4 was partially inhibited in the presence of CH3F.

Sexes did not differ in growth rate. Growth within the season varied greatly in different years and total growth deviated as much as 15.3% from the mean of the entire period. Water temperature, size of brood, and abundance of large walleyes and perch did not affect growth rate. Very early or late spawning influenced total growth during the season and final size and goodness or poorness of a season''s growth was determined by the middle of July. Growth rate of young-of-the-year perch and total use of perch as food did not significantly influence growth. Incidence of perch in walleye stomachs ranged from 10.9 to 98.0% and spottail shiner was a more important food item in most years than perch. Total first-year growth of the walleye was apparently determined before fish became a major item in the diet.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1960	5	3					281	290		10.4319/lo.1960.5.3.0281	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1960.5.3.0281													WOS:A1960WU64300004

Indirect evidence suggests that some lakes are shrinking. However, relatively few studies have been carried out to assess the regional groundwater conditions and the fate of the lakes due to the remoteness and severity of the desert environment. Here we use satellite information to demonstrate an ongoing slow decrease in both lake level and groundwater storage. Specifically, we use Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite altimetry data to quantify water levels of the lakes and show overall decreases from 2003 to 2009. We also use water storage changes from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment and simulated soil and water changes from the Global Land Data Assimilation System to demonstrate long-term groundwater depletion in the desert. Rainfall increase driven by climate change has increased soil water and groundwater storage to a certain degree but not enough to compensate for the long-term decline. If countermeasures are not taken to control the pumping, many lakes will continue to shrink, causing an ecological and environmental disaster in the fragile desert oases.

The positions of higher-concentration (>0.3 wt %) Sr bands and hyaline zones were identical in otoliths of eels from brackish waters;however, no corresponding higher-concentration Sr bands were discernible in otoliths of eels from fresh water. The higher-concentration Sr bands were deposited when the eels migrated from brackish water to high-saline seawater during winter. The number of hyaline zones in the otoliths corresponds to the age of the eel. Accordingly, higher-concentration Sr bands in otoliths can be used to determine fish age and migratory history in brackish waters.

As the water temperature near the lower edge of the ice is less than the temperature of maximum density at this depth, the heat flux launches the natural convection in the upper water layer. At the same time, the forced convection may occur in the lake. We associate the origin of forced convection with random events of ascent and dissociation of methane hydrates. Using mathematical models, we study the processes of natural and forced convection beneath the ice in a deep lake under the specific conditions of Lake Baikal. The results of numerical experiments have shown that the natural convection under the ice intensifies the process of forced convection.

Despite this, most bulk microphysical models disregard this natural shape effect and assume ice to grow spherically. This paper focuses on how the evolution of ice crystal shape and choice of ice nucleation parameterization in the adaptive habit microphysics model (AHM) influence the lake-effect storm that occurred during intensive observing period 4 (IOP4) of the Ontario Winter Lake-effect Systems (OWLeS) field campaign. This localized snowstorm produced total accumulated liquid-equivalent precipitation amounts up to 17.92 mm during a 16-h time period, providing a natural laboratory to investigate the ice-liquid partitioning within the cloud, various microphysical process rates, the accumulated precipitation magnitude, and its associated spatial distribution. Two nucleation parameterizations were implemented, and aerosol data from a size-resolved advanced particle microphysics (APM) model were ingested into the AHM for use in parameterizing ice and cloud condensation nuclei. Simulations allowing ice crystals to grow nonspherically produced 1.6%-2.3% greater precipitation while altering the nucleation parameterization changed the type of accumulating hydrometeors. In addition, all simulations were highly sensitive to the domain resolution and the source of initial and boundary conditions. These findings form the foundational understanding of relationships among ice crystal habit, nucleation parameterizations, and resultant cold-season mesoscale precipitation within detailed bulk microphysical models allowing adaptive habit.					; Gaudet, Lauriana/AAA-8528-2019; Yu, Fangqun/F-3708-2011	Gaudet, Lauriana/0000-0003-4679-4507; 													0022-4928	1520-0469				NOV	2019	76	11					3411	3434		10.1175/JAS-D-19-0004.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAS-D-19-0004.1													WOS:000491927300001

Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1c in hunting falcons and kept wild birds in Dubai implicate intercontinental virus spread	JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY												Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) of subtype H5N1 have continued to perpetuate with divergent genetic variants in poultry within Asia since 2003. Further dissemination of Asian-derived H5 HPAIVs to Europe, Africa and, most recently, to the North American continent has occurred. We report an outbreak of HPAIV H5N1 among falcons kept for hunting and other wild bird species bred as falcon prey in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, during the autumn of 2014. The causative agent was identified as avian influenza virus subtype H5N1, clade 2.3.2.1c, by genetic and phylogenetic analyses. High mortality in infected birds was in accordance with systemic pathomorphological and histological alterations in affected falcons. Genetic analysis showed the HPAIV H5N1 of clade 2.3.2.1c is a reassortant in which the PB2 segment was derived from an Asran-origin H9N2 virus lineage. The Dubai H5N1 viruses were closely related to contemporary H5N1 HPAIVs from Nigeria, Burkina-Faso, Romania and Bulgaria. Median-joining network analysis of 2.3.2.1c viruses revealed that the Dubai outbreak was an episode of a westward spread of these viruses on a larger scale from unidentified Asian sources. The incursion into Dubai, possibly via infected captive hunting falcons returning from hunting trips to central Asian countries, preceded outbreaks in Nigeria and other West African countries. The alarmingly enhanced geographical mobility of clade 2.3.2.1.c and clade 2.3.4.4 viruses may represent another wave of transcontinental dissemination of Asian-origin HPAIV H5 viruses, such as the outbreak at Qinghai Lake caused by clade 2.2 ('Qinghai' lineage) in 2005.

These data and the electron activity buffer capacity and O2 consumption intensity as found in Lake Constance profundal water show that the oxic-anoxic transition will occur, at the earliest, after 142 days (about 4.5 mo.) of total O2 isolation.

Hydrologic response to and recovery from differing silvicultural systems in a deciduous forest landscape with seasonal snow cover	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Hydrological consequences of alternative harvesting strategies in deciduous forest landscapes with seasonal snow cover have received relatively little attention. Most forest harvesting experiments in landscapes with seasonal snow cover have focused on clearcutting in coniferous forests. Few have examined alternative strategies such as selection or shelterwood cutting in deciduous stands whose hydrologic responses to harvesting may differ from those of conifers. This study presents results from a 31-year examination of hydrological response to and recovery from alternative harvesting strategies in a deciduous forest landscape with seasonal snow cover in central Ontario, Canada. A quantitative means of assessing hydrologic recovery to harvesting is also developed. Clearcutting resulted in increased water year (WY) runoff. This was accompanied by increased runoff in all seasons, with greatest relative increases in Summer. Direct runoff and baseflow from treatment catchments generally increased following harvesting, although annual peak streamflow did not. Largest increases in WY runoff and seasonal runoff as well as direct runoff and baseflow generally occurred in the selection harvest catchment, likely as a result of interception of hillslope runoff by a forest access road and redirection to the stream channel. Hydrologic recovery appeared to begin towards the end of the experimental period for several stream flow metrics but was incomplete for all harvesting strategies 15 years after harvesting. Geochemical tracing indicated that harvesting enhanced the relative importance of surface and near-surface water pathways on catchment slopes for all treatments, with the clearcut catchment showing the most pronounced and prolonged response. Such insights into water partitioning between flow pathways may assist assessments of the ecological and biogeochemical consequences of forest disturbance.

In a preliminary telemetry study of European catfish, the spring diel movement patterns of five adult catfish were examined. After intraperitoneal insertion of the acoustic tags, the positions of the fish were recorded automatically in the Flix Reservoir (River Ebro, NE Spain). A marked nocturnal mobility pattern was observed throughout the study. During daytime, the catfish were consistently located in the littoral zone and spent extended periods of the day hidden in concealed habitats. Catfish movements were in a radial pattern, with upstream and downstream excursions followed by returns to a previously occupied location. Significant individual variations in movement pattern were observed among the tagged fish and within the 24 h cycle for each fish. Mean instantaneous swimming speed was 0.17 body lengths per second (BL-s(-1)) at night but 0.09 BL-s(-1) during the daytime.

J	Hahnenberger, M; Nicoll, K				Hahnenberger, Maura; Nicoll, Kathleen			Meteorological characteristics of dust storm events in the eastern Great Basin of Utah, USA	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												We assess the mesoscale climatology of dust storm events affecting Salt Lake City, Utah (SLC) since the 1930s, and document the ascendant controls on atmospheric dust generation and transport in the semi-arid Great Basin. Records indicate a seasonal and diurnal pattern, with dust storms typically occurring in spring months during the afternoon. Since 1930, SLC had 379 dust event days (DEDs), averaging 4.7 per year. Air quality station data from populated regions in Utah indicate that dust events produced elevated PM10 exceeding NAAQS on 16 days since 1993, or 0.9 per year. Analysis of DEDs over the period 1948-2010 (n = 331) indicates that approaching mid-level troughs caused 68% of these dust outbreaks and storms. We analyzed two significant DEDs occurring on 19 April 2008 and 4 March 2009, both of which produced elevated particulate matter (PM) levels in the populated region surrounding SLC. Strengthening cyclonic systems are the primary producer of dust outbreaks and storms; the Great Basin Confluence Zone (GBCZ) in the lee of the Sierra Nevada is a known region of cyclogenesis. These cyclonic systems produce strong southwesterly winds in the eastern Great Basin of Utah - termed "hatu winds" - that exceed threshold friction velocities, entrain sediments and loft them into the atmosphere. Plumes identified in MODIS satellite imagery on case study DEDs indicate specific dust source areas, not widespread sediment mobilization. These "hotspots" include playa surfaces at Sevier Dry Lake, Tule Dry Lake, and the Great Salt Lake Desert, as well as Milford Flat, an area burned by Utah's largest wildfire in 2007. The characteristic mountain-valley topography in the Basin & Range physiographic province creates terrain channeling that enhances deflation and funnels dust-bearing winds toward SLC, a growing urban center.

No other wild bird appears in so many place-names. Crane bones are also quite common in archaeological sites, although they are absent from most cave sites; they are reported from at least 78 excavations. The evidence of bestiaries, illustrated manuscripts and other documentary sources makes it clear that the Crane was a well-known bird, clearly distinguished from the Grey Heron Ardea cinerea. AU three lines of evidence confirm that the Crane was a breeding bird in Britain, not just a winter visitor.																			0019-1019					JUL	1998	140	3					482	500		10.1111/j.1474-919X.1998.tb04610.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919X.1998.tb04610.x													WOS:000074455500014

The strain was successfully cultivated in an outdoor 150 L thin-layer photobioreactor under early winter conditions of Central Europe, where the average temperaturewas 10.0 degrees C and the average intensity of PAR 32 mu molm(-2) s(-1). The growth rate over the 22 days of the pilot cultivation reached a value of 0.341 day(-1) and lipid productivitywas 162 mgL(-1) day(-1). Theproportion of the 16: 4 and 18: 4 acidswas up to 19.1% and/or 34.7% of total fatty acids that resulted in a productivity of these acids of 27.5 and 43.7 mg L-1 day(-1), respectively, which is one order of magnitude higher than previously reported values.

Summer co-existence of small-sized cyprinid and percid individuals in natural and impounded stretches of a lowland river: food niche partitioning among fishes	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Due to changes of discharge regime downstream of a dam reservoir, an alluvial natural stretch of the Warta River changed to a macrophyte-dominated ecosystem. Large patches of submersed, aquatic macrophytes appeared in summer and their effect is analysed in this study. These patches contained enriched macroinvertebrate assemblages (epiphyton and benthos) and they were refuge for both zoo-plankton and young fishes released from the reservoir. Despite these altered conditions in this stretch, roach Rutilus rutilus, perch Perca fluviatilis and ruffe Gymnocephalus cernua dominated, as they did in the natural backwater. Fishes were sampled every 2 weeks from June to August, together with their food resources to assess the partitioning of the diet among small individuals of the three species in both stretches (the natural and affected ones). The aim of the analysis was to answer how animal food associated with water plants was partitioned between the species. In both stretches, G. cernua were primarily benthivorous, but epiphytic fauna, zooplankton and large-sized benthic chironomid larvae replaced lack of many large, benthic insects in the tailwater. Levins' food breath index decreased from 0.36 in the backwater to 0.29 in the tailwater. An opposite trend was observed for P. fluviatilis occurring among macrophytes. Perca fluviatilis were competitors of R. rutilus and took food not only in or on the river bed, but also in the water column. They ate zooplankton and epiphytic fauna and Levins' index increased from 0.32 to 0.44 in the tailwater. Rutilus rutilus fed on adult insects, algae and plant fragments in the natural stretch. In the tailwater, these food types were chiefly complemented by zooplankton. Despite this, the niche breadth of R. rutilus was similar at the two sites. Abundance of food associated with the macrophytes appeared to facilitate cohabitation in the abundant fish populations, but P. fluviatilis appeared to benefit the most in the altered river stretch.

Nodularin in feathers and liver of eiders (Somateria mollissima) caught from the western Gulf of Finland in June-September 2005	HARMFUL ALGAE												Nodularins are cyanobacterial hepatotoxins, which may cause intoxication at very low exposure levels. The nodularin-producing cyanobacterium Nodularia spumigena usually forms massive blooms in much of the Baltic Sea during the summer season. Breast feathers and liver samples from common eider (Somateria mollissima) were analysed for nodularins by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Fifteen ciders from the western Gulf of Finland were caught by hunters between June and September 2005. Blue mussels (Mytilus edulis), a dietary component of the birds, were also obtained by diving near the same marine area and time as the collection of the ducks. Eider breast feathers contained 6-52 mu g nodularin-R (Nod-R)/kg dry weight (dw) by ELISA, and 8-43 mu g Nod-R/kg dw by LC-MS. No Nodularia filaments were adhered to feather samples according to light microscopy assessment. Liver samples from the same individuals contained Nod-R between 3 and 48 mu g/kg dw by LC-MS. Mussel samples from the area contained Nod-R at concentrations of 12-80 mu g/kg dw by LC-MS. Analysis of bird feathers offers a facile and non-invasive means of assessing the exposure of birds to nodularins. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Large (> 2.27 kg), medium (1.36-2.27 kg), and small (< 1.36 kg but not including age-0 individuals) fish exhibited different patterns of seasonal abundance in a study area about 40 km uptake from the dam. Large fish were never taken in the study area in June, July, August, or September, or when surface water temperatures exceeded 22.degree. C. Abundance of medium-sized fish was significantly lower during June-September and when temperatures were above 22.degree. C than in other months and at cooler temperatures. Small fish remained abundant in the uptake area all year but were almost never collected at dissolved oxygen concentrations less than 6.0 mg/L in summer. Substantial numbers of small fish were collected at temperatures as high as 29.degree. C, but their catch per unit effort dropped from a mean of 11.8/net at 28.degree. C to 1.9/net at 30.degree. C. Our results supported the thermal niche hypothesis for striped bass, and the response of small striped bass to high temperatures was similar to that reported previously.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAY	1989	118	3					243	250		10.1577/1548-8659(1989)118<0243:IOWQAS>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1989)118<0243:IOWQAS>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1989DC50300002

In the upper part of the photic zone, bacterial secondary production constituted 12% of the C fixed by the phytoplankton. In vertical profiles, bacterial secondary production ranged from 7.6% (early spring) to 121% (during Aug.) of the C fixed by the algae. A close relationship was found between occurrence and activity of bacteria and algae, suggesting that released organic products are of primary importance to the bacteria. The annual phytoplankton primary production was estimated as 227 g C m-2 compared to 102 g C m-2 assimilated by the bacteria, so 45% of the C fixed by the phytoplankton went through pelagic bacteria.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1983	13	4					389	398		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1983.tb00688.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1983.tb00688.x													WOS:A1983RD37800007

Movement rates (0.00-17.35 km d(-1)) and ranges ((x) over bar = 39 km) were similar to those for riverine populations. All study fish returned to spanning sites used in previous years, but they also visited other spawning areas. Spawning females were significantly (P = 0.031) more active than males (480 vs. 87 m d(-1)) and moved substantial distances between spawning sites during peak reproduction (1-28 February). Fish became most active (m d(-1), km month(-1)) after spawning and moved to areas known to support higher algal production. Fish were typically within 50 m (P < 0.001) of shore and at average depths between 3.1 and 16.8 m (range 0.2 to > 30.0 m). Adults were detected throughout the available thermal gradient (12 degrees-30 degrees C), but during summer typically had body temperatures between 18 degrees and 22 degrees C. Vertical movements within the water column showed no correlation with depth or time of day, but seasonal shifts suggest fish may regulate body temperature by seeking spe cific temperatures during reservoir stratification.																			1527-0904					APR	2000	60	2					180	187																WOS:000087409200007

The Tangbai River Basin (TRB), a watershed crossing Henan province and Hubei province, China, forms one of the nation's most productive agricultural regions. The TRB has been exposed to high doses of fertilizers for a long time. This study simulates hydrologic and nutrient cycling in the TRB using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) with limited data available. The results indicate that dryland fields, which constitute 62% of the basin area, produce 80% of total nitrogen (TN) and 85% of total phosphorus (TP) yields of the whole river basin. The water quality of river sections at the provincial boundary shows that only 29% of the time from 2000 to 2019 met the Class III standard regarding TN and TP concentrations, and the concentrations in the spring flood season are approximately three times the mean in the non-flood season. The Grain for Green ecological restoration measure in Henan province shows that restoration of non-flat drylands can reduce nutrient loads at trans-provincial sections by 3.5 times compared to that of slope-independent drylands; however, the water quality compliance rate remains similar. The value of ecological compensation can also vary widely depending on different quantitative criteria. The SWAT-based pollutant quantification method adopted in this study could have implications for ecological compensation in trans-regional rivers.

Sabkha Regions of Tropical East Africa	SABKHA ECOSYSTEMS: AFRICA AND SOUTHERN EUROPE, VOL III	Tasks for Vegetation Science											Sabkhat in the region of tropical East Africa (treated here as Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania) are comparatively small in area and limited mostly to lake basins in the Eastern Rift and a few coastal areas. A relatively large inland sabkha lies in North Kenya, west of Lake Turkana, associated with the Chalbi Desert (a former lake). The chief plants of saline flats that surround the saline lakes in Kenya and Uganda include Cyperus laevigatus, Sporobolus spicatus and Dactyloctenium spp. The coastal sabkhat, flooded only at spring tides, are occupied by monospecific stands of stunted Avicennia marina. At the more open parts of the Avicennia fringe Arthrocnemum indicum, Paspalum vaginatum, Sesuvium portulacastrum, Sporobolus virginicus, S. spicatus, S. kentrophyllus, Pedalium murex and Suaeda monoica form the main associates. In the inland sabkhat low rainfall and high potential evaporation have resulted in an arid and saline landscape dominated by grasses Aristida adscensionis, A. mutabilis, Drake-Brockmania somalensis, Sporobolus consimilis, S. virginicus and Psilolemma jaegeri, and the subshrubs Duosperma eremophilum and Indigofera spinosa. Lagenantha nogalensis occurs on gypsophilous soils and Dasysphaera prostrata on saline soils at the edges of Lake Turkana and the Chalbi Desert. Stunted woody vegetation is dominated by Acacia reficiens and in drainage channels by Salvadora persica. Floristically the coastal sabkhat of tropical East Africa fall in the Zanzibar-Inhambane regional mosaic and the inland sabkhat in the Somalia-Masai regional centre of endemism. There are no endemic genera in the coastal sabkhat, but all of the nine East African mangrove species occur in Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique. In the inland sabkhat, the Somalia-Masai regional centre of endemism includes the endemic genera Drake-Brockmania and Dasysphaera. There is no arid-zone agriculture in the inland sabkhat region and nomadic pastoralists, depending on their livestock for subsistence, are the main occupants; Duosperma and Indigofera are amongst some of the important food plants of livestock (camels). Salt deposits are harvested from the extensive flats surrounding the saline and soda lakes, and the mangrove is an important economic resource as a nursery for fish and crustaceans, as well as a source of poles, timber and firewood. Over-harvesting of wood and conversion to saltpans and aquaculture, housing and industry is a threat to many parts of the mangrove area. There are no strict nature reserves in the inland sabkhat of tropical East Africa designated for the protection of arid landscapes and its flora; however the Mount Kulal Biosphere Reserve in northern Kenya covers the salt desert and lake ecosystems; Lake Manyara and Amboseli Biosphere Reserves also partly cover the saline and alkaline ecosystems. Mangrove areas are included in Watamu Marine National Park, Kiunga National Marine Reserve and Ras Tenewi Marine National Park in Kenya, and in Mafia Island Marine Park, Jozani National Park and Sadaani Game Reserve in Tanzania. Other areas of East African mangrove are included in forest reserves, with varying degrees of protection.																			0167-9406		978-90-481-9672-2				2011	46						1	7		10.1007/978-90-481-9673-9_1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-9673-9_1	10.1007/978-90-481-9673-9												WOS:000286165300001

Food web de-synchronization in England's largest lake: an assessment based on multiple phenological metrics	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Phenological changes have been observed globally for marine, freshwater and terrestrial species, and are an important element of the global biological fingerprint' of climate change. Differences in rates of change could desynchronize seasonal species interactions within a food web, threatening ecosystem functioning. Quantification of this risk is hampered by the rarity of long-term data for multiple interacting species from the same ecosystem and by the diversity of possible phenological metrics, which vary in their ecological relevance to food web interactions. We compare phenological change for phytoplankton (chlorophyll a), zooplankton (Daphnia) and fish (perch, Perca fluviatilis) in two basins of Windermere over 40years and determine whether change has differed among trophic levels, while explicitly accounting for among-metric differences in rates of change. Though rates of change differed markedly among the nine metrics used, seasonal events shifted earlier for all metrics and trophic levels: zooplankton advanced most, and fish least, rapidly. Evidence of altered synchrony was found in both lake basins, when combining information from all phenological metrics. However, comparisons based on single metrics did not consistently detect this signal. A multimetric approach showed that across trophic levels, earlier phenological events have been associated with increasing water temperature. However, for phytoplankton and zooplankton, phenological change was also associated with changes in resource availability. Lower silicate, and higher phosphorus, concentrations were associated with earlier phytoplankton growth, and earlier phytoplankton growth was associated with earlier zooplankton growth. The developing trophic mismatch detected between the dominant fish species in Windermere and important zooplankton food resources may ultimately affect fish survival and portend significant impacts upon ecosystem functioning. We advocate that future studies on phenological synchrony combine data from multiple phenological metrics, to increase confidence in assessments of change and likely ecological consequences.

M.			Multidecadal climate-induced changes in Arctic tundra lake geochemistry and geomorphology	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												High-latitude lakes are sensitive indicators of climate and important ecological components of Northern landscapes. The response of Arctic lakes to accelerated 20(th) century warming has largely been inferred from paleolimnological and shorter-term observational studies (< 20 yr). Here, we present a long-term observational dataset outlining a suite of chemical, biological, and physical changes in three Russian tundra lakes over a 43-yr period (1953-1996). In all three lakes, epilimnetic water temperature, alkalinity, and calculated pCO(2), measured during the ice-free period in late summer, increased over time. Over the same period, the rates of primary and bacterial production increased significantly. Permafrost thaw at the base and margins of the lakes likely resulted in the observed increase in size, as measured by average depth, surface area, and total volume. The observed changes show strong correlation with temperature, suggesting an overall pronounced response to warming. Importantly, CO2 sourced from either in situ or allochthonous respiration of thawed permafrost would indicate the destabilization of a large C reservoir.

The delta O-18 and delta H-2 values of rainfall show seasonality across the study area due to the different vapor sources. The moisture source for precipitation is the Arabian Sea during the monsoon season (July-September) and from a westerly source during winters (December-January). The delta O-18 and delta H-2 values of the surface water bodies show an evaporative signature across the study area. We also observed spatial and depth-related variations in the delta O-18 and delta H-2 values of groundwater. Here, we categorized groundwater samples into two depth zones based on the surface topography, isotopic values of groundwater, and aquifer characteristics. The groundwater zone-1a-b (depth:<65 m below ground level (bgl)) shows active recharge processes because of rainfall recharge and seepage from surface water bodies. We observed the dominance of precipitation recharge in groundwater zone-2 (depth:>150 m bgl) due to the regional groundwater flow pattern. We suggest two groundwater flow patterns present in the study area: local flow system is limited to zone-1a-b, whereas the regional flow pattern can be seen in zone-2. The present study provides new insight into the study area's recharge mechanism to understand the hydrological processes in any lake basin.

In China, lakes supply freshwater and ecosystem services to nearly a billion people. Therefore, real time monitoring of lake transparency is of great significance. Moreover, understanding how and why transparency varies in space and time in response to different driving forces is needed to understand, manage, and predict lake water quality. Based on the time-saving and low-cost Google Earth Engine cloud platform, this study developed a new algorithm for quickly mapping SDDs in Chinese lakes. SDDs were retrieved for 412 Chinese lakes (> 20 km(2)) for the period 2000-2018. Results demonstrated that lake water depth spatially differentiated transparency. Deep lakes usually had high transparency and water depth explained 88.81 % of the spatial variations. With increasing catchment vegetation coverage and lake water depth, 70.15 % of lakes witnessed increasing transparency during 2000-2018. Of these 42.72 % were significant (p < 0.05). Transparency of deep lakes was generally determined by phytoplankton density not sediment resuspension. Minimum transparency occurred in summer. Future increases in lake water levels in response to factors such as climate change may contribute to further improvements in transparency. Management should focus on controlling eutrophication and increasing vegetation cover in catchments.

This needs to take into consideration the influence of natural variation (both spatial and temporal) of reference biological communities as this may obscure the effects caused by anthropogenic disturbance. We studied the influence of among-habitat and temporal (seasonal and interannual) changes on the macroinvertebrate communities of an Iberian shallow lake and the variability of 21 measures potentially useful for bioindication purposes. Two series of data were examined: (a) macroinvertebrate samples taken on four occasions over an annual cycle were used to assess the effects of seasonality and among-habitat variability; (b) macroinvertebrate samples collected in three consecutive summers were used to assess interannual variability. Coefficients of variation, expressed as percentage, were used to quantify the effect of among-habitat and temporal variability on the selected metrics. According to our results, % Insecta, Shannon-Wiener diversity index and the qualitative taxonomic metrics (measures based on number of taxa) were robust in terms of temporal (seasonal and interannual) and among-habitat variability. Abundance ratio and some metrics based on functional feeding groups were highly variable. Therefore, qualitative taxonomic metrics may be promising tools in biomonitoring programs of Mediterranean shallow lakes due to their comparatively low variability.					; Fernandez-Alaez, Camino/L-7321-2014; Fernández-Aláez, Camino/K-5292-2014; García-Criado, Francisco/AAC-6024-2019	Garcia-Criado, Francisco/0000-0003-3419-7086; Fernandez-Alaez, Camino/0000-0001-9385-1354; Trigal, Cristina/0000-0002-4886-3388; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2006	563						371	384		10.1007/s10750-006-0031-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0031-5													WOS:000237552100029
J	France, RL; Peters, RH				France, RL; Peters, RH			Predictive model of the effects on lake metabolism of decreased airborne litterfall through riparian deforestation	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												The importance of airborne allochthonous litter to the carbon and nutrient budgets of lakes has been seldom studied. We compiled data on the input of terrestrial litter to develop a simple and speculative model to predict the potential consequences of riparian deforestation on one aspect of lake metabolism, specifically the balance between phytoplankton production and plankton respiration. During the autumn of 1992, 56 litter traps were deployed around the littoral zones of four oligotrophic lakes in a densely forested region of northwestern Ontario, Canada. The airborne litter input was estimated to be 32 g dry weight per meter of forested shoreline per year Allochthonous litter input per unit offshore distance teas related to the size of riparian trees, their proximity to the shoreline, and the elevation of their canopy. Combining our data with those from other studies suggests that terrestrial litter can contribute up to 15% of the total carbon supply to oligotrophic lakes and up to 10% of the total phosphorus supply to lakes with a large surface area relative to that of their drainage basin. These results were incorporated into a simple model that predicts that removal of shoreline trees could increase the ratio of plankton production to respiration in oligotrophic lakes situated within small drainage basins. Such lakes may therefore shift from allotrophy to increasing autotropy (energy self-sustenance) following riparian deforestation.						france, robert/0000-0002-9171-8426													0888-8892					DEC	1995	9	6					1578	1586		10.1046/j.1523-1739.1995.09061578.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1523-1739.1995.09061578.x													WOS:A1995TL67200025
J	Wang, P; Shpakova, RN				Wang, Ping; Shpakova, Raisa N. N.			Complex streamflow responses to climate warming in five river basins in South Yakutia, Russia	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												The climate is warming much faster than the global average at the northern mid-high latitudes, leading to intensified hydrological cycles. However, it is unclear whether the response of streamflow to climate change is uniform across river basins with areas of 10(4)-10(5) km(2). In this study, monthly streamflow data from five river basins (Bol'shoy Patom, Chara, Olekma, Timpton, and Uchur) and gridded monthly temperature and precipitation data from the Russian South Yakutia at 53.5-61.5 & DEG;N were analysed to investigate changes in their annual streamflow from 1934 to 2019 and their responses to climate warming. The results showed significant increasing trends in air temperature for all five basins at rates of 0.20 & DEG;C-0.22 & DEG;C/decade (p < 0.001), with faster warming after the 1980s. Apart from the Uchur River Basin, increasing trends in annual precipitation were observed in the other four river basins at rates of 9.3-15.7 mm/decade (p < 0.01). However, temporal changes in streamflow were much more complex than those in air temperature and precipitation among the five basins. Only two of the five basins showed significant increasing trends in annual streamflow with change rates of 17.1 mm/decade (p < 0.001) for the Chara River and 7.7 mm/decade (p < 0.05) for the Olekma River. Although the other three basins showed slightly increasing trends in annual streamflow (1.8-4.0 mm/decade), these trends did not pass significance tests (p > 0.05). By analysing the temperature-precipitation-streamflow relationships, we determined that the annual streamflow positively responds to precipitation, while winter streamflow is most sensitive to temperature. With climate warming, the streamflow during the winter period (October-April) increased significantly in four of the five river basins at rates of 1.4-3.1 mm/decade (p < 0.001), suggesting that warming-induced permafrost thawing increases baseflow. Although the streamflow response of large Siberian rivers to climate change is consistent, our results suggest that the streamflow response to climate change in relatively small river basins (10(4)-10(5) km(2)) is much more complex.

Answers were given by 298 anglers. The number of anglers who visited Misuzu Lake was 3,135-4,034 in the year. Fifty percent of the anglers were aged 30 to 40. Thirty-three percent of visitors were visiting with their family. The percentage of women was 15%, which was high compared to other types of freshwater fishing. Visitors from areas outside of the prefecture accounted for 19%, and 43% of them stayed overnight or longer, many of them at a nearby hot spring resort. The economic ripple effect of smelt fishing on the area is estimated at 170.7-198.4 million yen, suggesting that smelt fishing significantly contributes to the local economy and society.																			0021-5392	1349-998X					2018	84	4					711	719		10.2331/suisan.17-00083	http://dx.doi.org/10.2331/suisan.17-00083													WOS:000454724500021

We applied the ecological model PCLake based on 22 years of data from shallow, eutrophic Lake Sobygaard, Denmark and simulated multiple combinations of increasing temperatures (0-6 degrees C), reduced external nutrient loads (0%-98%) with and without internal phosphorus loading. Simulations suggest nitrogen to be the main limiting nutrient for primary production, reflecting ample phosphorus release from the sediment. The nutrient loading reduction scenarios predicted increased diatom dominance, accompanied by an increase in the zooplankton: phytoplankton biomass ratio. Simulations generally showed phytoplankton to benefit from a warmer climate and the fraction of cyanobacteria to increase. In the 6 degrees C warming scenario, a nutrient load reduction of as much as 60% would be required to achieve summer chlorophyll-a levels similar to those of the baseline scenario with present-day temperatures.

J	Muchuru, S; Landman, WA; DeWitt, D; Lötter, D				Muchuru, Shepherd; Landman, Willem A.; DeWitt, David; Loetter, Daleen			Seasonal rainfall predictability over the Lake Kariba catchment area	WATER SA												The Lake Kariba catchment area in southern Africa has one of the most variable climates of any major river basin, with an extreme range of conditions across the catchment and through time. Marked seasonal and interannual fluctuations in rainfall are a significant aspect of the catchment. To determine the predictability of seasonal rainfall totals over the Lake Kariba catchment area, this study used the low-level atmospheric circulation (850 hPa geopotential height fields) of a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model (CGCM) over southern Africa, statistically downscaled to gridded seasonal rainfall totals over the catchment. This downscaling configuration was used to retroactively forecast the 3-month rainfall seasons of September-October-November through February-March-April, over a 14-year independent test period extending from 1994. Retroactive forecasts are produced for lead times of up to 5 months and probabilistic forecast performances evaluated for extreme rainfall thresholds of the 25th and 75th percentile values of the climatological record. The verification of the retroactive forecasts shows that rainfall over the catchment is predictable at extended lead-times, but that predictability is primarily found for austral mid-summer rainfall. This season is also associated with the highest potential economic value that can be derived from seasonal forecasts. A forecast case study of a recent extreme rainfall season (2010/11) that lies outside of the verification period is presented as evidence of the statistical downscaling system's operational capability.

J	LUND, JWG				LUND, JWG			FURTHER OBSERVATIONS ON THE SEASONAL CYCLE OF MELOSIRA-ITALICA (EHR) KUTZ SUBSP SUBARCTICA OMULL	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The changes in the abundance of the diatom in the plankton of two lakes from week to week or even day to day have been followed for a year. Evidence is brought forward to show that these changes are almost always caused by concomitant changes in certain physical and chemical factors which have previously been shown to control the general periodicity of this diatom over a period of 7 1/2 years. The main factor is turbulence, itself a function of wind action on, and temperature distribution within, the water mass. Under stratified conditions, the cells, by virtue of their high rate of sinking, pass rapidly to the deposits. However, large loss of cells by sedimentation can also occur under isothermal conditions if almost dead calm conditions persist for several days. The amount of loss of cells by outflow is also important. Limitation of growth by nutrient shortage occurred in one lake. It is suggested that silica was the nutrient responsible. The abundance of the diatom differed in the two lakes. This may be related to the number of live cells left on the deeper deposits in the previous summer and to differences in the morphology and location of the lakes.																			0022-0477	1365-2745					1955	43	1					90	+		10.2307/2257123	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2257123													WOS:A1955XM34800010

The causes of long-term variations in water exchange and water quality are discussed using the long-term data such as topographic and bathymetric changes, measurement and meteorological change over the recent 50 years. The construction of the outside jetties at the inlet led to the higher water exchange rate, which made the bottom water environment better. Since 1980, the water temperature rise associated with meteorological changes such as air temperature rise and the increase of phosphorus release flux are responsible for the deterioration of water quality.																			1098-6189		978-1-880653-70-8				2008							503	509																WOS:000259888200075

ACTA VETERINARIA HUNGARICA												Myxobolus hungaricus Jaczo, 1940 forms relatively large plasmodia on the gills of bream (Abramis brama). The authors give a redescription of this deficiently described parasite on the basis of spores collected from the original habitat, which spores are indicated as a neotype. The plasmodia of the parasite can be found on the gills typically in the spring months, and are located in the central part of the gill filaments. They start to develop in the lumen of capillaries of the secondary lamellae and remain in intralamellar location also after they have reached the mature stage. The spores have a very characteristic shape, as on the surface of the spore valves a distinctly emerging ridge runs parallel to the sutural line. In addition to breams from the typical habitat, Lake Balaton, the plasmodia of M. hungaricus could be detected also on breams originating from the river Danube.

Evaporation and the subcanopy energy environment in a flooded forest	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The combination of tree canopy cover and a free water surface makes the subcanopy environment of flooded forested wetlands unlike other aquatic or terrestrial systems. Subcanopy vapour fluxes and energy budgets represent key controls on water level and understorey climate but are not well understood. In a permanently flooded forest in south-eastern Louisiana, USA, an energy balance approach was used to address (a) whether evaporation from floodwater under a forest canopy is solely energy limited and (b) how energy availability was modulated by radiation and changes in floodwater heat storage. A 5-month continuous measurement period (June-November) was used to sample across seasonal changes in canopy activity and temperature regimes. Over this period, the subcanopy airspace was humid, maintaining saturation vapour pressure for 28% of the total record. High humidity coupled with the thermal inertia of surface water altered both seasonal and diel energy exchanges, including atypical phenomena such as frequent day-time vapour pressure gradients towards the water surface. Throughout the study period, nearly all available energy was partitioned to evaporation, with minimal sensible heat exchange. Monthly mean evaporation ranged from 0.7 to 1.7 mm/day, peaking in fall when canopy senescence allowed greater radiation transmission; contemporaneous seasonal temperature shifts and a net release of stored heat from the surface water resulted in energy availability exceeding net radiation by 30% in October and November. Relatively stable energy partitioning matches Priestley-Taylor assumptions for a general model of evaporation in this ecosystem.					; Edwards, Brandon/AAN-8896-2021; Keim, Richard/AAI-6514-2020	Edwards, Brandon/0000-0002-5178-3733; Keim, Richard F./0000-0003-4488-9537; Allen, Scott/0000-0002-4465-2348													0885-6087	1099-1085				JUL 31	2017	31	16					2860	2871		10.1002/hyp.11227	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.11227													WOS:000406838200004

Evolution of upper crustal faulting assisted by magmatic volatile release during early-stage continental rift development in the East African Rift	GEOSPHERE												During the development of continental rifts, strain accommodation shifts from border faults to intra-rift faults. This transition represents a critical process in the evolution of rift basins in the East African Rift, resulting in the focusing of strain and, ultimately, continental breakup. An analysis of fault and fluid systems in the younger than 7 Ma Natron and Magadi basins (Kenya-Tanzania border) reveals the transition as a complex interaction between plate flexure, magma emplacement, and magmatic volatile release. Rift basin development was investigated by analyzing fault systems, lava chronology, and geochemistry of spring systems. Results show that extensional strain in the 3 Ma Natron basin is primarily accommodated along the border fault, whereas results from the 7 Ma Magadi basin reveal a transition to intra-rift fault-dominated strain accommodation. The focusing of strain into a system of intra-rift faults in Magadi also occurred without oblique-style rifting, as is observed in Ethiopia, and border fault hanging-wall flexure can account for only a minor portion of faulting along the central rift axis (similar to 12% or less). Instead, areas of high upper crustal strain coincide with the presence of hydrothermal springs that exhibit carbon isotopes and N-2-He-Ar abundances indicating mixing between mantle-derived (magmatic) fluids and air saturated water. By comparing the distribution of fault-related strain and zones of magmatic fluid release in the 3 Ma Natron and 7 Ma Magadi basins, we present a conceptual model for the evolution of early-stage rifting. In the first 3 m.y., border faults accommodate the majority of regional extension (1.24-1.78 mm yr(-1) in Natron at a slip rate ranging 1.93-3.56 mm yr(-1)), with a significant portion of intra-rift faulting (38%-96%) driven by flexure of the border fault hanging wall. Fluids released from magma bodies ascend along the border fault and then outward into nearby faults forming in the flexing hanging wall. By 7 m.y., there is a reduction in the amount of extension accommodated along the border fault (0.40-0.66 mm yr(-1) in Magadi at a slip rate ranging from 0.62 to 1.32 mm yr(-1)), and regional extension is primarily accommodated in the intra-rift fault population (1.34-1.60 mm yr(-1)), with an accompanying transition of magmatic volatile release into the rift center. The focusing of magma toward the rift center and concomitant release of magmatic fluids into the flexing hanging wall provides a previously unrecognized mechanism that may help to weaken crust and assist the transition to intra-rift dominated strain accommodation. We conclude that the flow of magmatic fluids within fault systems plays an important role in weakening lithosphere and focusing upper crustal strain in early-stage continental rift basins prior to the establishment of magmatic segments.					; Stamps, D Sarah/JUU-3443-2023	Fischer, Tobias/0000-0002-3467-0649; Muirhead, James/0000-0002-9386-817X; KIANJI, GLADYS/0000-0001-8078-8819; Stamps, D.

We evaluated mass marking and stocking success by sampling the stocked fish for I year poststocking. More than 128,000 fingerlings (35-64 mm total length) were immersed in a solution of 500 mg/L oxytetracycline (OTC) for 6 h and stocked into four embayments in the lake in spring 2002; two additional embayments served as controls and were not stocked (these embayments contained only wild, indigenous fish). In a blind test, 97% of sagittal otoliths were correctly scored as marked or unmarked. In a subsequent test, the OTC marks were clearly visible on every otolith removed from 240 OTC-treated bass held for 30 d. Age-0 largemouth bass were sampled with DC electrofishing gear at 7-19, 44-61, and 119-139 d after stocking, and sampling was conducted along 100-m transects within 1 km of the stocking sites in each embayment. Of all recaptures in the first sample, 31% occurred more than 600 in from the nearest stocking site, indicating rapid dispersal by some fish. Survival of stocked and wild age-0 largemouth bass was similar and low (4.5-6.9%) in two embayments; in the other two embayments, stocked fish survived at lower rates (0-4.3%) than wild fish (33.7-49.9%). Mean catches of all age-0 largemouth bass in the first sample were positively related to the number of fish stocked. By October 2002, the mean catch of all age-0 largemouth bass was similar among embayments. Contribution of stocked fish declined to approximately 2% (2 of 91 fish) the following spring. Cost per fingerling increased from US$0.35 at stocking to $12.00 at 140 d poststocking. Increasing the abundance of largemouth bass was not the primary objective of this stocking effort, but stocked fish will have to survive much better if managers hope to introgress Florida largemouth bass genes into the resident population genome.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				NOV	2005	25	4					1518	1527		10.1577/M04-164.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M04-164.1													WOS:000234015800033
