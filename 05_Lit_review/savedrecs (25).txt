The main difference between the novel isolates and known sulfur bacteria was their potential to grow and oxidize sulfur compounds at ph 10 and higher. The isolates fell into two groups that were substantially different from each other physiologically and genetically. Most of the Siberian isolates belonged to the group with a low DNA G+C content (48.0-51.2 mol%). They were characterized by a high growth rate, a low growth yield, a high cytochrome content, and high rates of oxidation of sulfide and thiosulfate. This group included 18 isolates with a DNA homology of more than 40 %, and it is described here as a new genus, Thioalkalimicrobium, with two species Thioalkalimicrobium aerophilum (type species) and Thioalkalimicrobium sibericum. The other isolates, mainly from Kenyan soda lakes, fell into a group with a high DNA G+C content (61.0-65.6 mol%). In general, this group was characterized by a low growth rate, a high molar growth yield and low, but relatively equal, rates of oxidation of thiosulfate, sulfide, elemental sulfur and polythionates. The group included 25 isolates with a DNA homology of more than 30%. It was less compact than Thioalkalimicrobium, containing haloalkalophilic, carotenoid-producing, nitrate-reducing and facultatively anaerobic denitrifying strains. These bacteria are proposed to be assigned to a new genus, Thioalkalivibrio, with three species Thioalkalivibrio versutus (type species), Thioalkalivibrio denitrificans and Thioalkalivibrio nitratis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that both groups belong to the gamma -Proteobacteria. The Thioalkalimicrobium species were closely affiliated with the neutrophilic chemolithoautotrophic sulfur bacteria of the genus Thiomicrospira, forming a new alkaliphilic lineage in this cluster. In contrast, Thioalkalivibrio was not related to any known chemolithoautotrophic taxa, but was distantly associated with anaerobic purple sulfur bacteria of the genus Ectothiorhodospira.

In the period from 3 June to 1 September 2020, extreme fluctuations of DO in the surface layer of water were recorded (values in the range of 0-25.48 mg l(-1)). The DO concentrations were affected by phytoplankton photosynthesis and fluctuated within 12 h from more than 100% saturation (in the afternoon) to zero (at dawn). DO values near the bottom were less variable (0-9.67 mg l(-1)) and after mid-July, zero values prevailed. A huge fish kill associated with windy weather occurred between 26 and 28 August 2020, resulting in more than 800 kg of dead fish. High percentages of dead fish were of the northern pike (Esox lucius), the pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) and the European catfish (Silurus glanis). Wind-induced water mixing (when oxygenated water containing phytoplankton moved from the surface to the anoxic bottom) and subsequent depletion of oxygen by decomposition processes in the organic substrate of the bottom, in combination with limited sunshine in the same period, resulted in a 2-day lack of oxygen both in the surface layer of water and near the bottom. Repeated fish kills probably contribute to the massive occurrence of the resistant and invasive topmouth gudgeon (Pseudorasbora parva) at the locality.

This species may also occur in Marble Falls Cave in Marion County, but sexually mature specimens are needed to verify that occurrence. The description of B. speleopolis raises the total number of species in Bactrurus to eight.

J	HOWMILLER, RP				HOWMILLER, RP			COMPARISON OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND BODY TEMPERATURES AS PREDICTORS OF MATING CALL PARAMETERS OF SPRING PEEPERS	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Data from a survey of the profundal benthos of 26 Wisconsin lakes [USA] suggested that tubificid worms occur more commonly, and are typically abundant, in the benthos of the more oligotrophic lakes but gave no evidence of overall relationships with trophic status. Correlation analysis indicated that conditions which favor tubificids are higher dissolved O2 concentrations (within the range encountered), great depth and low numbers of the dipteran predator Chaoborus. The observations led the the hypothesis that predation by dipteran larvae may strongly influence worm abundance in the profundal benthos and that predation may be particularly important when worm production is low because of anoxia or low dissolved O2 concentrations.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1977	97	1					211	216		10.2307/2424697	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2424697													WOS:A1977CW34200018

Molecular phylogenetics of central Canadian physidae (Pulmonata: Basommatophora)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												The phylogenetic relationships of four nominal south-central Canadian freshwater physids (Physa (sensu lato) skinneri Taylor, 1954, Physa integra (Haldeman, 1841), Physa gyrina (Say, 1821), and the endemic Physa winnipegensis Pip, 2004) were studied by analyses of combined partial sequences coding for mitochondrial 16S and cytochrome c oxidase (COI) genes. Maximum parsimony and neighbour joining analyses, as well as comparisons with published sequences, supported four major clades of physids, of which three are represented in central Canada. Physa skinneri and P. integra were placed within the Physa fontinalis (L., 1758) and Physa acuta Draparnaud, 1805 clades, respectively. Physa winnipegensis formed a distinct branch within the P. acuta group.

J	JELLYMAN, DJ				JELLYMAN, DJ			SUMMER UPSTREAM MIGRATION OF JUVENILE FRESHWATER EELS IN NEW-ZEALAND	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												During summer, upstream migrations of juvenile freshwater eels (elvers) of both species (Anguilla australis schmidtii Phillipps, the short-finned eel, and A. dieffenbachii Gray, the long-finned eel) are observed at hydro-electric dams and waterfalls. The migration was sampled at Karapiro Dam on the Waikato River, 1970, 1971 and 1974, and samples from 11 more areas throughout the country were analyzed. Elvers, active at night or during overcast and damp days, surmount steep obstacles by climbing; they adhere to damp surfaces by friction and surface tension, obtaining maximum resistance by undulating their bodies and keeping them closely adpressed to the substrate. The maximum size for vertical climbing is 12 cm. As elvers were sampled at sites where their migration was interrupted, no distinct schools were observed, but the elvers were strongly social and thigmotactic. Migrations are made up of elvers of similar size of 1 or both species. In large river systems, elvers apparently migrate successively further upstream each year for several years. North Island samples contained elvers up to 3 yr of age but in the South Island elvers up to 7 yr old were recorded; aging was by burned otoliths. Migration is perhaps initiated by increases in water temperature, day length and sociability; increased water flow may also coincide with runs. Electric fishing of streams shows the 2 spp. have different habitat preferences and these are reflected in the proportion of elvers caught at different sites: longfins prefer swift stony rivers, while shortfins prefer silty backwaters and lakes, but both are often found together. Longfin elvers have thick dermal skin layers and experiments in air of constant temperature and humidity showed that longfins cannot survive prolonged exposure requiring cutaneous respiration as well as shortfins; longfins may also have higher O2 requirements.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1977	11	1					61	71		10.1080/00288330.1977.9515661	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1977.9515661													WOS:A1977DU14900004

The influence of microcurrents and larval density on P. mixtum and Stegopterna mutata are discussed. The distribution along the stream bed changed with time. With these 2 spp. the spacing of the larvae and changes in microcurrent preferences displaced the population downstream as development proceeded, although other factors may play a role in the displacement. The distribution of the other 2 spp. was closely tied to the oviposition sites at lake outlets and showed little displacement with time.

Palynological, charcoal and diatom analyses of a lake sediment core from Lake Lindu (Danau Lindu) reveal that during the last 1,000 years the Lindu plain has been modified by human activities. Evidence of frequent burning and possible shifting cultivation from an earlier phase from ca. AD 1000 to 1200 might be related to the metal age population which erected the megaliths in the province of Central Sulawesi. From ca. AD 1200-1700 there followed 500 years of wetter climate conditions, corresponding to the southward movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. At the same time, decreases of macro-charcoal concentrations and pioneer vegetation indicators show that the use of the landscape of Lindu plain had become more permanent. Following a phase of forest recovery from ca. AD 1730 to 1910, the most recent part of the Lake Lindu record shows a trend towards deforestation that started in the late 20th century, lasting until now. The lake level started to fall at the beginning of the 20th century, as shown by the increase of sedimentation rate and supported by low pollen concentration and palaeomagnetic data. Such a change was unprecedented for the last 1,000 years covered by the record, and it has no link to the climate variability as reconstructed for the last hundred years. If deforestation increases and a larger amount of water is channelled away from the lake for irrigation purposes, the lake level will continue to fall. This suggests that there is a need for better management of the forests surrounding the plain and of the irrigation systems in the area open for cultivation.					; St-Onge, Guillaume/E-4828-2014; Haberzettl, Torsten/AAV-9216-2021	St-Onge, Guillaume/0000-0001-6958-4217; Haberzettl, Torsten/0000-0002-6975-9774; Wang, Liang-Chi/0000-0002-2320-0908													0939-6314	1617-6278				JAN	2016	25	1					1	17		10.1007/s00334-015-0523-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-015-0523-1													WOS:000373747500001

Validation using in situ aircraft data, radiosondes, ground-based radar, and surface observations showed that the MM5, which featured four domains with 36-, 12-, 4-, and 1.33-km grid spacing, realistically simulated the observed partial blocking of the 8-12 m s(-1) ambient southwesterly flow and development of a convergence zone and enhanced lowland precipitation region upwind of the initial Wasatch slope. The MM5 also properly simulated the advance of this convergence zone toward the base of the Wasatch during the passage of a midlevel trough, despite not fully capturing the westerly wind shift accompanying the trough. Accurate simulation of the observed precipitation over the central Wasatch Mountains (within 25% of observed at all stations) required a horizontal grid spacing of 1.33 km. Despite close agreement with the observed surface precipitation, the Reisner2 bulk microphysical scheme produced too much supercooled cloud water and too little snow aloft. A model microphysical budget revealed that the Reisner2 generated over half of the surface precipitation through riming and accretion, rather than snow deposition and aggregation as implied by the observations. Using an intercept for the snow size distribution that allows for greater snow concentrations aloft improved the snow predictions and reduced the cloud water overprediction. Sensitivity studies illustrate that the reduced surface drag of the Great Salt Lake (GSL) enhanced the convergence zone and associated lowland precipitation enhancement upstream of the Wasatch Mountains. The presence of mountain ranges south of the Great Salt Lake appears to have weakened the along-barrier flow and windward convergence, resulting in a slight decrease in windward precipitation enhancement. Diabatic cooling from failing precipitation was also important for maintaining the blocked flow.					; KINGSMILL, DAVID/D-5899-2016; Kingsmill, David/D-5899-2016	Colle, Brian/0000-0002-4546-5472; KINGSMILL, DAVID/0000-0001-5824-8402; Steenburgh, Jim/0000-0003-1028-4230; 													0027-0644	1520-0493				OCT	2005	133	10					2947	2971		10.1175/MWR3017.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR3017.1													WOS:000232952800009

The distribution of this toxin is expanding around the world and the number of cyanobacteria species producing this toxin is also increasing. CYN was detected for the first time in Turkey during the summer months of 2013. The responsible species were identified as Dolichospermum (Anabaena) mendotae and Chrysosporum (Aphanizomenon) ovalisporum. The D. mendotae increased in May, however, C. ovalisporum formed a prolonged bloom in August. CYN concentrations were measured by LC-MS/MS and ranged from 0.12 mu g.mg(-1) to 4.92 mu g.mg(-1) as dry weight, respectively. Both species were the only cyanobacteria actively growing and CYN production was attributed solely to these species. Despite CYN production by C. ovalisporum being a well-known phenomenon, to our knowledge, this is the first report of CYN found in D. mendotae bloom.					, reyhan/AAB-8612-2020; Meriluoto, Jussi/A-5309-2008; Oğuz, Ayça/AAA-4929-2020; , merbay/AAB-9694-2020; köker, latife/AAB-7634-2020; Oguz, Ayca/AAA-4929-2020	Koker, Latife/0000-0002-9134-2801; Meriluoto, Jussi/0000-0002-6300-301X; Oguz, Ayca/0000-0002-0711-2967														2072-6651				NOV	2014	6	11					3173	3186		10.3390/toxins6113173	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxins6113173								25412284					WOS:000345531100009

Warmer does not have to mean sicker: Temperature and predators can jointly drive timing of epidemics	ECOLOGY												Ecologists and epidemiologists worry that global warming will increase disease prevalence. These fears arise because several direct and indirect mechanisms link warming to disease, and because parasite outbreaks are increasing in many taxa. However, this outcome is not a foregone conclusion, as physiological and community-interaction-based mechanisms may inhibit epidemics at warmer temperatures. Here, we explore this thermal-cormmunity-ecology-based mechanism, centering on fish predators that selectively prey upon Daphnia infected with a fungal parasite. We used an interplay between a simple model built around this system's biology and laboratory experiments designed to parameterize the model. Through this data-model interaction, we found that a given density of predators can inhibit epidemics as temperatures rise when thermal physiology of the predator scales more steeply than that of the host. This case is met in our fish-Daphnia-fungus system. Furthermore, the combination of steeply scaling parasite physiology and predation-induced mortality can inhibit epidemics at lower temperatures. This effect may terminate fungal epidemics of Daphnia as lakes cool in autumn. Thus, predation and physiology could constrain epidemics to intermediate temperatures (a pattern that we see in our system). More generally, these results accentuate the possibility that warmer temperatures might actually enhance predator control of parasites.

These blooms suddenly ceased in 1964. Responses of the summer phytoplankton communities to nutrient enrichments, analysed experimentally in enclosures, identified phosphorus as the factor limiting both G. sanguineum and a dominant Fragilaria tenera. Competitive interactions suggested that the dinoflagellates were favoured by higher temperatures, whereas the diatoms were limited by silica reduction. The ratio between the biovolumes of the two algae was an important parameter for predicting which species would benefit from the phosphorus additions and outcompete the other one under the experimental condition.					; Cantonati, Marco/G-4278-2018	Cantonati, Marco/0000-0003-0179-3842; Spitale, Daniel/0000-0002-3955-9157													0031-8884	2330-2968				MAY	2005	44	3					320	327		10.2216/0031-8884(2005)44[320:CBAPDA]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.2216/0031-8884(2005)44[320:CBAPDA]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000229349100010

MSLED: The Micro Subglacial Lake Exploration Device	UNDERWATER TECHNOLOGY												Satellite altimetry and ice-penetrating radar have shown the existence of active subglacial lakes in Antarctica which may have a significant impact on the Southern Ocean and the dynamics of the overlying ice sheet. Understanding how subglacial floods affect ice dynamics is imperative to predicting the effect of ice sheets on rising sea levels, but it is not clearly understood. Furthermore, these encapsulated lakes contain uncharacterised biological ecosystems and serve as analogue environments for future extraterrestrial exploration. To investigate these subglacial environments, the authors developed the Micro Subglacial Lake Exploration Device (MSLED), a unique highly-miniaturised remotely operated vehicle. Equipped with a high-resolution imaging system, as well as conductivity, temperature and depth sensors for in situ measurements, the MSLED is capable of determining geological, hydrological and biological characteristics of subglacial lakes. It was successfully deployed in Antarctica during the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 Antarctic summer seasons in collaboration with the Whillans Ice Stream Subglacial Access Research Drilling (WISSARD) expedition to Subglacial Lake Whillans (SLW), contributing to the discovery of microbial ecosystems within these environments. The present paper outlines the scientific background behind the mission, the design and implementation of the MSLED, as well as the results of tests and initial deployments in Antarctica.

Morphological features of the taxon were similar to those described elsewhere.

Maximum abundances at any given site reached 393 and 0.9 trichomes/mL in Mona Lake and Muskegon Lake, respectively. Although these concentrations are low relative to other reports, the presence of this species in these two lakes from adjacent watersheds adds to a growing body of literature that suggests the distribution of C. raciborskii is on the increase in northern latitudes.

J	Liu, B; Wu, CD; Zhou, XH				Liu, Biao; Wu, Chundu; Zhou, Xiaohong			Community structure of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms in the Grand Canal, Zhenjiang, of Jiangsu Province, China	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												In this study, we simultaneously investigated the community structure and abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in the Grand Canal (the Zhenjiang section). Both clone library and qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) indicated that the abundance and diversity of AOB were higher than AOA in the Grand Canal for all four seasons. Among the 109 archaeal amoA sequences retrieved, 62.39 and 37.61% fell within the Nitrosopumilus and Nitrososphaera clusters, respectively. The 128 bacterial amoA gene sequences obtained in this study were grouped with known AOB sequences in the Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira genera, which occupied 81.25 and 18.75% of the AOB group, respectively. The AOA abundance was significantly and positively correlated with the NH4-N. The AOB abundance did not show significant correlations with the measured parameters. Obvious differences were observed for the AOA community compositions obtained from different seasons. The community structure of AOB changed slightly. It indicated that AOB seemed to play a more important role for the nitrification process than AOA in this environment, and was more adapted to this environment.																			0273-1223	1996-9732					2014	70	6					990	995		10.2166/wst.2014.319	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2014.319								25259486					WOS:000343122700006

Hatch dates, growth, survival, and overwinter mortality of age-0 alewives in Lake Michigan:: Implications for habitat-specific recruitment success	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Alewives Alosa pseudoharengus are key components of Laurentian Great Lakes ecosystems and spawn in multiple habitat types. Exploration of alewife early life history dynamics within these different habitats should help identify important recruitment processes. During 2001-2003, we quantified physical (temperature, transparency) and biotic (chlorophyll a, zooplankton densities) habitat factors and collected age-0 alewives (using ichthyoplankton nets and trawls) in a nearshore region of Lake Michigan and Muskegon Lake, Michigan (a drowned river mouth lake connected to Lake Michigan). We characterized alewife hatch dates, individual condition, growth, mortality, and size-dependent overwinter survival to infer differences in habitat-specific recruitment success. Temperature, turbidity, chlorophyll-a concentrations, and densities of zooplankton prey were consistently higher in Muskegon Lake than in nearshore Lake Michigan. On average, young alewives in Muskegon Lake hatched earlier, grew faster, were in better condition (based on a biphasic length-weight relationship), and had greater survival than alewives in Lake Michigan. By the end of the growing season, young alewives in Muskegon Lake obtained a larger size than those residing in nearshore Lake Michigan, suggesting that they were more likely to survive through winter (a period of intense size-selective mortality) and ultimately recruit to the adult population.					; Carter, Glenn/P-4744-2016; Mason, Doran/ABF-1415-2020	Mason, Doran/0000-0002-6017-4243; Rutherford, Edward/0000-0002-7282-6667; Hook, Tomas/0000-0001-9185-6741; Carter, Glenn/0000-0001-6630-7513; 													0002-8487					SEP	2007	136	5					1298	1312		10.1577/T06-194.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T06-194.1													WOS:000250184600013

The research was carried out in May, June, July, and August 1999 in Lake Lubie, and a total of 3252 water mites (1880 females and 1178 males) belonging to 29 species were collected. A strong negative correlation was observed between the drop in temperature in the thermocline and the abundance and number of water mite species living beneath the thermocline. The negative correlation resulted from a considerable limitation of vertical migration of water mites by factors such as: low temperature below the thermocline, large difference between temperatures above and below the thermocline, and considerable thickness of the thermocline. During summer season, lower layers of the lake were increasingly penetrated by water mites as the temperatures above and below the thermocline were becoming more uniform. Lake species displayed the greatest ability to penetrate lower water layers and were present below the thermocline during the whole study period; moreover, their numbers were quite steady. On the contrary, the species, which are characteristic for small water bodies, crossed the thermocline in comparatively large numbers in June when the thermocline was of the lowest thickness.

The Widespread Influence of Great Lakes Microseisms Across the Midwestern United States Revealed by the 2014 Polar Vortex	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												During the winter of 2014, a weak polar vortex brought record cold temperatures to the north-central ("Midwest") United States, and the Great Lakes reached the highest extent of ice coverage (92.5%) since 1979. This event shut down the generation of seismic signals caused by wind-driven wave action within the lakes (termed "lake microseisms"), giving an unprecedented opportunity to isolate and characterize these novel signals through comparison with nonfrozen time periods. Using seismic records at 72 broadband stations, we observe Great Lakes microseism signals at distances >300 km from the lakes. In contrast to conventional oceanic microseisms, there is no clear relationship between the frequency content of the seismic signals (observed from similar to 0.5-5-s period) and the dominant swell period or resonance periods of the lakes based on their bathymetric profiles. Thus, the exact generation mechanism is not readily explained by conventional microseism theory and warrants further investigation.					; Wilson, David/AAG-6208-2020; Anthony, Rob/J-2212-2017	Anthony, Robert/0000-0001-7089-8846; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				APR 28	2018	45	8					3436	3444		10.1002/2017GL076690	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017GL076690													WOS:000435745500015

Prevalence of Actinobacteria in the production of 2-methylisoborneol and geosmin, over Cyanobacteria in a temperate eutrophic reservoir	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL ADVANCES												Commonly detected in surface waters worldwide, odorous compounds such as geosmin (GSM) and 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) pose important issues in drinking water and aquaculture industries. Impaired waters are frequently plagued by severe Cyanobacterial blooms and seasonal occurrences of Actinobacteria due to increased anthropogenic stressors as well as climate change that negatively impact the quality of water resources globally. Historically, studies have focused on the identification of key environmental factors and organisms involved in the production of GSM and MIB. This past decade, fast-evolving molecular techniques have greatly contributed to document the structure of bacterioplankton communities. Eagle Creek Reservoir, a eutrophic temperate reservoir, is frequently impacted by seasonal odorous episodes. During the spring 2013 outbreak of MIB and GSM (120.9 and 51.4 ng L-1, respectively), a shotgun metagenomics approach illustrated the dominance of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria in the reservoir waters. A network analysis highlighted interrelationships between bacterial taxa and environmental factors, and revealed two major clusters of bacteria: Cluster I driven by temperature and nitrate nitrogen and, Cluster II reflective of elevated concentrations of MIB and GSM. Analysis of 16S-based sequences recovered prevalently MIB- and GSM-encoding gene sequences belonging to several Actinobacteria (genus Streptomyces) rather than Cyanobacteria, formerly assumed to be the main producers. The use of genetics shifted our perception and stressed the role of Actinobacteria in the biosynthesis of odorous metabolites through the non-mevalonate pathway; as well as the detection of nonproducing Arthrobacter potentially involved in the degradation of these compounds.

Water discharge of the lower reaches has been seriously compromised and more than 30 tributaries and terminal lakes have dried up. The water output of springs has dropped significantly. Also water quality problems have been observed, in both surface waters and groundwater. Hydrological changes have resulted in a marked degradation of aquatic habitats, and have caused substantial, and expanding, land salinization and desertification. Solving these problems, which have been largely caused by human activities, requires massive and long-lasting concerted efforts.																			0262-6667	2150-3435				OCT	2001	46	5					647	658		10.1080/02626660109492862	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626660109492862													WOS:000171980100001
J	BROWN, PW				BROWN, PW			INFLUENCE OF AN UNIDENTIFIED EPORNITIC ON WATERFOWL NESTING AT JESSIE LAKE, ALBERTA	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												Lesser Scaup (Aythya affinis) and Gadwall (Anas strepera) nesting ecology was studied on Jessie Lake, Alberta (54.degree.10''N, 110.degree.04''W) during the summers of 1975 and 1976. High nest densities were found in both years, and nest success was high (74% for Lesser Scaup, 93% for Galdwall) in 1975. In 1976, an unidentified epornitic reduced nest success 49% for Lesser Scaup and 35% for Gadwall by killing incubating females or causing nest abandonment. Waterfowl management activities that increase densities of nesting waterfowl to levels similar to those on Jessie Lake may increase the chance of high mortality from disease.																			0008-3550					JUL-SEP	1987	101	3					454	456																WOS:A1987N309600026
J	Timoney, K; Peterson, G; Fargey, P; Peterson, M				Timoney, K; Peterson, G; Fargey, P; Peterson, M			Spring ice-jam flooding of the Peace-Athabasca Delta: Evidence of a climatic oscillation	CLIMATIC CHANGE												A historic record of spring ice-jam floods of the Peace-Athabasca Delta was analyzed for the years 1826-1995, The temporal pattern of flooding is non-random. The likelihood of a flood following a flood, or a non-flood following a non-flood, is greater than expected by chance. Probability analysis of flood occurrence reveals that the period 1860-1880 was a time of unusually few floods, and the period 1915-1950 was a time of unusually frequent floods. The long-term flood frequency is 1 flood in 6.25 years. Changes in flood frequency over the record reveal a pattern of oscillation described by a sine-based model that is correlated with the long-term (Gleissberg) cycle of solar activity. Monte Carlo simulation was used to test a Bennett Dam Model and a Cyclic Model. The Bennett Dam Model is unlikely to have generated the observed flood history (p = 0.04). The observed flood history shows a better fit to the Cyclic Model (p = 0.65), No correlations between floods and ENSO cold or warm events was detected. The most recent wet period began about 1900 and ended in the early 1960's prior to completion of the W. A. C. Bennett Dam in British Columbia. As independent corroboration of climatically-driven changes in flood frequency we present three additional lines of evidence. The pattern of annual muskrat returns (95 year record) reveals both 10 year cycles and long-term patterns that agree well with the observed flood cycle. The annual area burned in Wood Buffalo National Park is inversely related to flood occurrence. Incised channels and dendritic drainage patterns in the bed of Lake Mamawi provide probable evidence of a previous dry period in the delta. Climatic change or oscillation likely underlies the drying trend observed in recent decades in the Peace-Athabasca Delta.																			0165-0009					APR	1997	35	4					463	483		10.1023/A:1005394031390	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1005394031390													WOS:A1997WY92400006

We applied a regional scale foraminiferal transfer function to fossil assemblages preserved in a core of salt-marsh peat and organic silt that was dated using radiocarbon and recognition of pollution, Cs-137 and pollen chronohorizons. Our proxy reconstruction was combined with tide-gauge data from four nearby sites spanning 1913-2014 CE. Application of an Errors-in-Variables Integrated Gaussian Process (EIV-IGP) model to the combined proxy and instrumental dataset demonstrates that RSL fell from similar to 350 to 100 BCE, before rising continuously to present. This initial RSL fall was likely the result of local-scale processes (e.g., silting up of a tidal flat or shallow sub-tidal shoal) as salt marsh development at the site began. Since similar to 0 CE, we consider the reconstruction to be representative of regional-scale RSL trends. We removed a linear rate of 0.3 mm/yr from the RSL record using the EIV-IGP model to estimate climate-driven sea-level trends and to facilitate comparison among sites. This analysis demonstrates that since similar to 0 CE sea level did not deviate significantly from zero until accelerating continuously from similar to 1500 CE to present. Sea level was rising at 1.33 mm/yr in 1900 CE and accelerated until 2014 CE when a rate of 2.02 mm/yr was attained, which is the fastest, century-scale trend in the similar to 2000-year record. Comparison to existing reconstructions "from the Gulf coast of Louisiana and the Atlantic coast of northern Florida revealsimilar sea-level histories at all three sites. We explored the influence of compaction and fluvial processes on our reconstruction and concluded that compaction was likely insignificant. Fluvial processes were also likely insignificant, but further proxy evidence is needed to fully test this hypothesis. Our results indicate that no significant Common Era sea-level changes took place on the Gulf and southeastern Atlantic U.S. coasts until the onset of modern sea-level rise in the late 19th century.

Modeled sensitivity of Lake Michigan productivity and zooplankton to changing nutrient concentrations and quagga mussels	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The recent decline in Lake Michigan productivity is often attributed to filter feeding by invasive quagga mussels, but some studies also implicate reductions in lakewide nutrient concentrations. We use a 3-D coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model to evaluate the effect of changing nutrient concentrations and quagga mussel filtering on phytoplankton production and phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass. Sensitivity experiments are used to assess the net effect of each change separately and in unison. Quagga mussels are found to have the greatest impact during periods of isothermal mixing, while nutrients have the greatest impact during thermal stratification. Quagga mussels also act to enhance spatial heterogeneity, particularly between nearshore-offshore regions. This effect produces a reversal in the gradient of nearshore-offshore productivity: from relatively greater nearshore productivity in the prequagga lake to relatively lesser nearshore productivity after quaggas. The combined impact of both processes drives substantial reductions in phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass, as well as significant modifications to the seasonality of surface water pCO(2), particularly in nearshore regions where mussel grazing continues year-round. These results support growing concern that considerable losses of phytoplankton and zooplankton will yield concurrent losses at higher trophic levels. Comparisons to observed productivity suggest that both quagga mussel filtration and lower lakewide total phosphorus are necessary to accurately simulate recent changes in primary productivity in Lake Michigan.					; McKinley, Galen/IWU-5623-2023	McKinley, Galen/0000-0002-4072-9221; Reavie, Euan/0000-0001-8871-5809; Pilcher, Darren/0000-0002-0763-3236													2169-8953	2169-8961				AUG	2017	122	8					2017	2032		10.1002/2017JG003818	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JG003818													WOS:000410174100009

The event broke numerous long-standing records with wide-reaching and detrimental societal impacts. This study found that this rare and dangerous cold air outbreak (CAO) was a direct consequence of a tropopause polar vortex (TPV) originating at high latitudes and subsequently tracking southward into the United States. The tropopause depression at the center of this TPV extended nearly to the surface. Simulations using the atmospheric component of the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) were conducted, revealing excellent predictability at 6-7-day lead times with the strength, timing, and location of the CAO linked to the earlier characteristics of the TPV over the Arctic. Within the middle latitudes, the TPV subsequently developed a tilt with height. Warming and the destruction of potential vorticity also took place as the TPV passed over the Great Lakes initiating a lake-effect snow storm. The climatological investigation of CAOs suggests that TPVs frequently play a role in CAOs over North America with a TPV located within 1000 km of a CAO 85% of the time. These TPVs tended to originate in the northern Canadian Arctic and are ejected equatorward into the Great Lakes/Upper Midwest and then to the Northeast over Labrador. This study also provides insight into how the impact of Arctic circulations on middle latitudes may vary within the framework of a rapidly changing Arctic.					; Cavallo, Steven/O-5890-2019; Parsons, David/N-6693-2019	Parsons, David/0000-0002-7642-1085; Cavallo, Steven/0000-0002-9032-2542; 													0022-4928	1520-0469				SEP	2021	78	9					2801	2821		10.1175/JAS-D-20-0285.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAS-D-20-0285.1													WOS:000757421500009

Hominid environments at Hadar from paleosol studies in a framework of Ethiopian climate change	JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION												The amount and seasonal distribution of paleo-rainfall is a major concern of paleoanthropology because they determine the nature of the vegetation and the Structure of the ecosystem, particularly in eastern Africa. The delta O-18 and delta C-13 of paleosol carbonates are quantitative Proxies of these critical features of the paleoenvironment. The Afar region of Ethiopia lies between the African and Indian summer monsoons, and is prone to profound climate change. In the western Afar, the dominant paleoenvironment of the Hadar Formation during the late Pliocene was a major meandering river's distal low, flat floodplain, on which muds accreted that were continuously transformed into vegetated soils with Bk horizons rich in CaCo3. The mean delta C-13 of paleosols throughout the Hadar Formation translates to an average vegetative Cover across the extensive floodplain of about 30% of the C-4 grasses and 70% Of unspecified C-3 plants. The character of the paleosols, such as the one at Locality 333, and their delta O-18(Carbonate) argue for a highly seasonal rainfall of about twice today's amount, implying that the C3 plants were mostly sizeable trees and that the biome for Australopithecus afarnesis was a grassy woodland. The amount of grasses abruptly increased in the lower Busidima Formation with its early Homo and artifacts to a more open grassy woodland of ca. 50% grasses. However, this transition in delta C-13 is not mirrored in the delta O-18, which persists at a quite negative average value of -6.41 parts per thousand over the entire > 2-Myr duration of both formations. This value for the carbonate means that the paleosoil water was a quite negative 4.11 parts per thousand a significant 5 parts per thousand more negative than Our estimate of modern rain at Hadar. We put the negative 5180 of paleo-Hadar's rainfall into an isotopic framework of the dynamic history of climate change in sub-Saharan northern Africa. There have been two end-member climate regimes: (1) an earlier persistently pluvial Pliocene regime, with its Strong summer monsoon, as registered in the Hadar Formation, and (2) the modern cyclical, mostly and regime that began ca. 1 Myr ago, which has been punctuated by about ten cyclically predictable brief millennia-long pluvial episodes. The best known pluvial of the latter regime is the latest one, the African Humid Period (AHP), just 9.0-6.5 kyr ago, whose delta O-18(Rainfall) matches that for paleo-Hadar, The known climatological factors that brought On the AHP are probably the same ones that were persistently present for the Afar of the Pliocene. This dynamic rainfall history undoubtedly has influenced hominid occupation of the keystone Afar area at the gateway out of, and into, Africa. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The activity of total particulate material collected from a liter of seawater was more elevated in May, June and August than during the rest of the year. These high activities resulted from a high contribution of the >90 mum fraction which account then for more than 60% of the total particulate activity. Two Michaelian processes with high and low V-max were disclosed on this fraction. The high V-max component was responsible for the high summer activities. During these periods, high densities of cirriped Cypris were found which were statistically correlated with this high V a component as with its specific activity. Moreover, the contribution of attached bacteria to these high activities was low. In return, this contribution was predominant during the periods of low activity. A simple method was developed to characterise this bacterial activity. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Two meteorological variables' annual and seasonal trends at three weather stations in 1986-2023 were analyzed. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope methods were used to determine the presence of a positive or negative trend in weather data and their statistical significance. Hydrometric indicators were studied using the ArcGIS 10.8 program from 1995 to 2023. The results indicate an increasing average spring air temperature, with an annual rise of 0.08-0.09 degrees C. A significant trend in increasing average annual precipitation was observed in Saumalkol, with a rise of 4.7 mm per year. In contrast, no significant trends were found in the annual and seasonal precipitation data for Sergeyevka. It was also found that the area of Lake Saumalkol increased by 1.6% due to a rise in annual precipitation. In contrast, the area of Lake Kopa decreased by 6.04% because of an increase in the annual average temperature.

J	Djindjian, F				Djindjian, Francois			Territories and economies of hunter-gatherer groups during the last glacial maximum in Europe	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					17th World Congress of the International-Union-of-Prehistoric-and-Protohistoric-Sciences (UISPP)	SEP 01-07, 2014	Burgos, SPAIN	Int Union Prehistor Protohistor Sci				At the last glacial maximum, the Gravettian human groups moved to southern European Peninsulas: Iberian, Italian, Balkan and the gulfs: Tyrrhenian, Adriatic, Aegean and around the Black Sea (a lake at this time). There, they differentiated: Solutrean in Western Europe, Epigravettian in Central Europe and in Eastern Europe. Human groups, constrained in their new southern territories, returned to a system of small territories and low mobility, which required them to change the food resource system (gregarious mammal hunting replacing migratory herd hunting), sources of raw material procurement (reuse of quartzite), and, as a result, technology (return to flake knapping, importance of lamellar knapping) and industry. This local opportunistic strategy involved territories of less than 1000 km(2) and low mobility. The climate variations of the last glacial maximum reveal two wetter episodes, clearly visible in the sequences of loess of Central and Eastern Europe and in non-anthropogenic records around 20-19 000 BP and 18.5-17 000 BP. During these two episodes, human groups moved northward during the summer, in a seasonal mobility strategy, involving hunting of migratory animals and use of outcrops of good flint. These two systems existed during the last glacial maximum in Western, Central, and Eastern Europe, where, despite typological differences in assemblages, common characteristics may be highlighted.

J	Birks, SJ; Remeda, VN				Birks, SJ; Remeda, VN			Hydrogeological investigation of Chappice Lake, southeastern Alberta: Groundwater inputs to a saline basin	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Sediment cores from Chappice Lake, a hypersaline, groundwater-fed lake in southeastern Alberta, have been used in previous studies to reconstruct Holocene climate using lake levels as a source for proxy climate data. This assumes that the lake is fed by a shallow groundwater system sensitive to changes in climate. In this study we use the dynamics and chemistry of groundwater entering the lake to test this hypothesis. Groundwater inputs calculated from historical records using a simple water budget were highest during periods when the precipitation deficit was high. Over specific time intervals, the expected relationship between lake volumes and climate were not always found. Feedback loops between lake levels and groundwater input, and time lags within the system are the mechanisms proposed to explain these discrepancies. Field measurements suggest discharge of a local surficial groundwater system. Slug tests reveal a high conductivity system (K = 10(-5) m/s) surrounding the lake. Hydraulic heads measured in standpipe, multilevel and minipiezometers installed around Chappice Lake show that the lake is situated in a closed hydraulic head contour. Hydraulic heads and water table elevations show strong annual fluctuations corresponding to seasonal changes in recharge. Horizontal hydraulic gradients measured in areas of groundwater springs indicate a strong horizontal component of flow towards the lake. Vertical hydraulic gradients are low and indicate the upward flow of water consistent with the discharge of a shallow, surfical groundwater system. Groundwater sampled from deposits surrounding Chappice Lake and springs feeding the lake have compositions similar to both shallow surficial aquifers and bedrock aquifers suggesting that the lake may be receiving inputs from both sources. However, evaporation simulations using PHRQPITZ, show that the evaporation of water typical of bedrock aquifers result in a mineral assemblage and brine composition different from that found at Chappice Lake. This suggests that discharge of a regional groundwater system can be eliminated as a dominant source over the lake's history. Evaporation simulations suggest that evaporation of groundwater from shallow surficial deposits can best explain the present mineral assemblage and brine chemistry and were likely the dominant source of water to the lake. Bedrock and shallow surficial groundwater sources have different chemistries and isotopic compositions. In hydrogeological settings such as Chappice Lake where more than one source may contribute to the lake, the relative importance of the different sources may change with changes in climate. If the source water composition to the lake changes, identifying changes in climate or hydrology based on changes in the composition of the lake preserved in sediment core will be made more difficult. This may complicate paleoclimate and paleohydrological reconstructions that rely on mineralogical and isotopic data.

Fish play an important role in the aquatic ecosystem of Poyang Lake. Accurate assessment of fish species diversity and community composition is essential for studies of fish ecology and conservation management. In this study, environmental DNA metabarcoding was used to analyze fish diversity and community structure in different habitats and seasons in the Poyang Lake Basin. A total of 52 fish species were identified, and limnicolous fish were the most abundant; most fish were omnivorous and small. The fish diversity index was highest in the spring and in the main lake area of Poyang Lake. Cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed significant differences in fish community structure among habitats. Water temperature and pH were the main environmental factors affecting fish community structure in the Poyang Lake Basin. Noninvasive environmental DNA monitoring methods could provide an important auxiliary method for monitoring fishery resources during the 10-year fishing ban period. This study provides basic information on the fish resources in the Poyang Lake Basin and has implications for fishery management and the development of ecological protection policies.																			0165-7836	1872-6763				JAN	2025	281								107192	10.1016/j.fishres.2024.107192	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2024.107192		SEP 2024											WOS:001327840900001
J	Ye, WJ; Liu, XL; Tan, J; Li, DT; Yang, H				Ye, Wenjin; Liu, Xianglong; Tan, Jing; Li, Daotang; Yang, Hong			Diversity and dynamics of microcystin-Producing cyanobacteria in China's third largest lake, Lake Taihu	HARMFUL ALGAE												Microcystins (MC), the most prevalent group of harmful cyanobacterial hepatotoxins, are primarily produced by strains of cyanobacteria in Microcystis, Anabaena and Planktothrix. Lake Taihu, which is the third largest freshwater lake in China, is a hypertrophic shallow lake in eastern China that has experienced lake-wide cyanobacterial blooms annually during the last few decades. In this study, PCR-DGGE was used to evaluate the diversity of potential MC-producing cyanobacteria and real-time PCR was used to analyze the dynamics of this population based on the presence of the mcy gene in samples collected during a year long study. The results revealed that all MC-producing genotypes detected belonged to the genus Microcystis. In addition, the MC-producing genotype communities were more diverse during the bloom season than the non-bloom season, and the diversity in the late bloom period was lower than the diversity in the early bloom period. Furthermore, the abundance of MC-producing genotypes increased dramatically during the bloom development period, reaching its peak in late summer (September). The results also suggested that the highest mcy gene concentration lagged behind the highest MC concentration, and the potential MC-producing cyanobacterial community shift lagged behind the development of blooms.

Absorption efficiencies of nitrogen and carbon in two Chironomus species found dominating in the profundal zone of mesotrophic Lake Erken were determined gravimetrically. 2. Absorption efficiencies for C. plumosus showed greater seasonal variation than those of C. anthracinus, with low efficiencies coinciding with the summer dominance of flagellate phytoplankton and with high C:N ratios. 3. Overall mean absorption efficiencies (.+-. SE) for carbon and nitrogen, respectively, were 26.8% (.+-. 1.9) and 29.3% (.+-. 1.9) for C. plumosus, 24.6% (.+-. 1.7) and 28.1% (.+-. 1.8) for C. anthracinus. 4. Significant differences were found to exist between the C:N ratios of the superficial 2 cm sediment layers and those of Chironomus anterior midgut contents. 5. C. anthracinus appears to be a deposit feeder ingesting particulate matter scraped from the recently deposited surface sediments. The greater seasonal variation found in the absorption efficiencies of C. plumosus, together with the lower C:N ratios, support the contention that this species is a filter feeder with the nutritional quality of ingested matter depending primarily on pelagic inputs.

Seasonal speedup of a Greenland marine-terminating outlet glacier forced by surface melt-induced changes in subglacial hydrology	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												We present subdaily ice flow measurements at four GPS sites between 36 and 72 km from the margin of a marine-terminating Greenland outlet glacier spanning the 2009 melt season. Our data show that >35 km from the margin, seasonal and shorter-time scale ice flow variations are controlled by surface melt-induced changes in subglacial hydrology. Following the onset of melting at each site, ice motion increased above background for up to 2 months with resultant up-glacier migration of both the onset and peak of acceleration. Later in our survey, ice flow at all sites decreased to below background. Multiple 1 to 15 day speedups increased ice motion by up to 40% above background. These events were typically accompanied by uplift and coincided with enhanced surface melt or lake drainage. Our results indicate that the subglacial drainage system evolved through the season with efficient drainage extending to at least 48 km inland during the melt season. While we can explain our observations with reference to evolution of the glacier drainage system, the net effect of the summer speed variations on annual motion is small (similar to 1%). This, in part, is because the speedups are compensated for by slowdowns beneath background associated with the establishment of an efficient subglacial drainage system. In addition, the speedups are less pronounced in comparison to land-terminating systems. Our results reveal similarities between the inland ice flow response of Greenland marine- and land-terminating outlet glaciers.

J	WILLIAMS, MW; MELACK, JM				WILLIAMS, MW; MELACK, JM			SOLUTE CHEMISTRY OF SNOWMELT AND RUNOFF IN AN ALPINE BASIN, SIERRA-NEVADA	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Snowpack runoff contributions to the hydrochemistry of an alpine catchment in the Sierra Nevada were evaluated in 1986 and 1987 by analyzing snowpack, meltwater, and stream water samples for major inorganic ions, conductance, acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), and silicate. An ionic pulse in meltwater with initial concentrations twofold to twelvefold greater than the snowpack average, varying with site and with ion, was measured in lysimeters placed at the base of the snowpack. Maximum concentrations of ions in meltwater were inversely related to the rate of snowmelt; melt-freeze cycles increased the concentration of solutes in meltwater. Hydrogen concentration in meltwater was buffered by ANC produced in part by the dissolution of particulates. The anionic pulse in meltwater was observed in stream waters during the first 30 days of snowpack runoff, with NO3- concentrations in stream waters at this time about 1.6-fold greater than the average NO3- concentration for the time period of snowpack runoff, Cl- about 1.5-fold greater and SO4(2-) about 1.3-fold greater. Maximum H+ concentration during snowpack runoff (increase of 170% over winter concentrations) occurred near maximum discharge. ANC minima occurred at maximum discharge as a result of dilution, with a decrease from winter concentrations of 70% in 1986 and 60% in 1987. Interactions between snowpack runoff and soils were important to the chemistry of stream water. Eighty to ninety percent of the H+ stored in the snowpack was consumed before it reached the base of the catchment. Soils were a sink for NH4+ from snowpack meltwater, with less than 1% of the NH4+ released from snowpack storage exported from the basin as NH4+. Sulfate concentrations in stream waters were less variable than NO3- or Cl- concentrations; sorption processes in soils were a likely cause for the regulation of SO4(2-) concentrations.																			0043-1397					JUL	1991	27	7					1575	1588		10.1029/90WR02774	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/90WR02774													WOS:A1991FV77700019
J	Coopersmith, EJ; Minsker, B; Montagna, P				Coopersmith, Evan Joseph; Minsker, Barbara; Montagna, Paul			Understanding and forecasting hypoxia using machine learning algorithms	JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS												This study's primary objective lies in short-term forecasting of where and when hypoxia may transpire to enable observing its effects in real time, focusing on a case study in Corpus Christi Bay (Texas). Dissolved oxygen levels in this bay can be characterized by three temporal trends (daily, seasonal, and long-term). To predict hypoxic events, these three mathematical trends are isolated and extracted to obtain unbiased forecasts using a sequential normalization approach. Next, machine learning algorithms are constructed employing the continuous, normalized values from a variety of sensor locations. By including latitude and longitude coordinates as additional variables, a spatial depiction of hypoxic conditions can be illustrated effectively, allowing for more efficient summer data collection and more accurate, near-real-time projections. Using k-nearest neighbor and regression tree algorithms, approximate probabilities of observing hypoxia the following day were calculated, and estimates of dissolved oxygen levels were also computed. During periods in which hypoxia was observed, forecast probabilities of hypoxia exceeded 80%. Conversely, during periods in which no hypoxia was observed, the model's estimate remained below 20%. These results indicate that the modeling approach produces reasonable forecasts for this case study.					; Montagna, Paul/J-8208-2017	Minsker, Barbara/0000-0001-7981-2973; Montagna, Paul/0000-0003-4199-3312													1464-7141	1465-1734					2011	13	1					64	80		10.2166/hydro.2010.015	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/hydro.2010.015													WOS:000287301900006

J	Ding, BJ; Li, ZK; Cai, MM; Lu, MZ; Liu, WZ				Ding, Bangjing; Li, Zhengkui; Cai, Miaomiao; Lu, Mingzhu; Liu, Wenzhi			Feammox is more important than anammox in anaerobic ammonium loss in farmland soils around Lake Taihu, China	CHEMOSPHERE												Ammonium (NH4+) oxidation is a key step in nitrogen transformation in ecosystems. Prior to the recent discovery of Feammox (anaerobic NH4+ oxidation coupled with iron reduction), anammox (anaerobic NH4+ oxidation coupled with nitrite reduction) was thought of as the only pathway by which anaerobic NH4+ loss (NH4+ directly to N2) occurs in soils. Experimental evidence has confirmed that both anammox and Feammox contribute to anaerobic NH4+ loss; however, their relative contributions to this process in farmland soils are largely unknown. Therefore, in this study, we examined the seasonal activities of anammox and Feammox in conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) soils around Lake Taihu, China. Isotopic tracing experiments showed higher anammox and Feammox rates in summer than in other seasons, and the contribution of Feammox to anaerobic NH4+ loss from the farmland soils (54.6%-69.3%) was higher than that of anammox. Further, the Feammox rates corresponding to the two soil tillage practices were significantly different, whereas their corresponding anammox rates showed no significant differences. Furthermore, molecular analysis showed that the abundance of Geobacteraceae differed significantly with season and tillage practice, whereas the abundance of anammox bacteria showed no significant differences between CT and NT practices. Structural equation modeling also revealed that the anammox rate was directly or indirectly driven by N availability and season, whereas the Feammox rate was driven by soil moisture content, Fe(III) concentration, Fe(III) reduction rates, tillage practice, and season. Overall, this study enhances understanding regarding anaerobic NH4+ oxidation in farmland soils and highlight the importance of Feammox in NH4+ loss in such an ecosystem.					; LI, zhengkui/AAC-1410-2022	Lu, Mingzhu/0000-0002-1601-6707; 													0045-6535	1879-1298				OCT	2022	305								135412	10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.135412	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.135412		JUN 2022						35724714					WOS:000822556200007

Towards validation of the Canadian precipitation analysis (CaPA) for hydrologic modeling applications in the Canadian Prairies	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												This study presents a three-step validation technique to compare the performance of the Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA) product relative to actual observation as a hydrologic forcing in regional watershed simulation. CaPA is an interpolated (6 h or 24 h accumulation) reanalysis precipitation product in near real time covering all of North America. The analysis procedure involves point-to-point (P2P) and map-to-map (M2M) comparisons, followed by proxy validation using an operational version of the WATFLOOD (TM) hydrologic model from 2002 to 2005 in the Lake Winnipeg Basin (LWB), Canada. The P2P technique using a Bayesian change point analysis shows that CaPA corresponds with actual observations (Canadian daily climate data, CDCD), on both an annual and seasonal basis. CaPA has the same spatial pattern, dependency and autocorrelation properties as CDCD pixel by pixel (M2M). When used as hydrologic forcing in WATFLOOD (TM), results indicate that CaPA is a reliable product for water resource modeling and predictions, but that the quality of CaPA data varies annually and seasonally, as does the quality of observations. CaPA proved most beneficial as a hydrologic forcing during winter seasons where observation quality is the lowest. Reanalysis products, such as CaPA, can be a reliable option in sparse network areas, and is beneficial for regional governments when the cost of new weather stations is prohibitive.

J	Kullman, L; Kjällgren, L				Kullman, L; Kjällgren, L			Holocene pine tree-line evolution in the Swedish Scandes: Recent tree-line rise and climate change in a long-term perspective	BOREAS												This article focuses on the Holocene tree line (Pinus sylvestris) and climate change in the Swedish Scandes. A composite of three previously independently published data sets of megafossil tree remains (trunks, stumps and roots) from sites above today's tree line is analysed. Calibration of ages, adjustment for glacio-isostatic land uplift and a larger sample provide new and more conclusive insights. The tree-line altitude peaked about 11 200 cal. yr BP, 425 m higher than the position about a century ago, when it was at its Holocene low. At the millennial-centennial scale, tree-line retraction has been a smooth process, following a linear trend, which largely conforms to the Milankovitch model of orbital forcing of summer temperature evolution. Shorter excursions from this trend cannot be ruled out, as these are beyond the resolution of the analytical approach. During the earliest Holocene, summers may have been about 2.5 degrees C warmer than by the late-19th century. Projection of the 20th-century maximum tree-line rise by 150-190 m upon the entire Holocene tree-line chronology indicates that present-day tree lines may be higher than ever during the past 5000 or even 7000 years. Indirectly, this might reflect an anomalous modern climatic regime for which there is supporting evidence from retreating mountain glaciers and recent evolution of the alpine plant cover and its zonation patterns. With this background, the evolution of the tree-line ecotone in the case of continued warming is considered. Pine is likely to regain the dominant position held in the early Holocene. Its tree line may shift at least 400 m above its present position. Small outlier stands of mountain birch will establish in sheltered, moderately snow-rich habitats high above the new pine tree line, but an overall alpine character of the landscape will prevail above the tree line of pine. Exotic tree species, mainly belonging to the genus Pinus may profit from a new climatic regime and establish in the tree-line ecotone.																			0300-9483	1502-3885				FEB	2006	35	1					159	168		10.1080/03009480500359137	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03009480500359137													WOS:000234922300011

This occurrence has been attributed to the use of gasoline-powered watercraft. This paper documents and explains both seasonal and daily variations in MTBE concentrations at Cranberry Lake. During a recent boating season (late April to September 1999), concentrations of MTBE typically exceeded 20 mug/L. MTBE concentrations varied daily from 12 to 24 mug/L over a 2-week period that included the Labor Day holiday. Concentrations were highest on weekends when there is more boat traffic, which had an immediate effect on MTBE mass throughout the lake. MTBE concentrations decreased to about 2 mug/L shortly after the end of the summer recreational season. The loss of MTBE can be accounted for by volatilization, with a half-life on the order of 10 days. The volatilization rate was modeled with the daily decrease in MTBE then the modeled rate was validated using the data from the seasonal decline. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Based on typological and attribute analysis of the beads, which employed the Kidd and Kidd classification system and comparison with published "glass bead periods" or GBPs developed for assemblages in Ontario, the GLO#3 bead assemblage is assigned a date within the 1630s. Comparison with other midwestern protohistoric assemblages further supports this interpretation. Situated within a protohistoric period of intercultural interaction and exchange, the material culture from the site provides archaeological evidence for some of the earliest arrivals of European-made trade items in the Midwest.					; Walder, Heather/AAZ-7053-2021	Walder, Heather/0000-0003-2312-245X; 													0146-1109	2327-4271					2017	42	2					137	167		10.1080/01461109.2017.1338826	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01461109.2017.1338826													WOS:000411620100002

Alternative pathways in the life history of Gracilaria gracilis (Gracilariales, Rhodophyta) from north-eastern Sicily (Italy)	AQUACULTURE												The reproductive phenology of Gracilaria gracilis has been followed closely in a brackish water lake in Sicily. The life history of this red alga deviated from the typical Polysiphonia-type cycle and was characterized by the predominance of the tetrasporophytic phase over gametophytes, in situ development of germinated gametophytes and the presence of sterile pleustophytic thalli. Release of spherical agglomerates of cells produced by young tetrasporophytes was observed as well. Their ability to germinate forming new thalli appears to represent an alternative reproductive strategy of this organism. The population structure appears to reflect a predominance of the diploid phase except during the warmer summer season when only vegetative juveniles were found in the lake. Release and early stages of development of carpospores and tetraspores were critically observed in culture. A Dumontia type pattern of germination was observed for both types of spores, showing an erect thallus arising from a multicellular basal disk. Compared to tetraspores, carpospores are less readily released resulting in a subsequent delay in the development of new gametophytes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Effects of long-term protection from grazing on phenotypic expression in geographically separated mountain rough fescue populations	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE												Whether or not long-term grazing or protection from grazing alters the genetic makeup of grass populations has been debated. Mountain rough fescue [(Festuca campestris (Rydb.)], which is highly sensitive to summer grazing, and becomes dominant in plant communities with long-term protection, was chosen to address this question. Plants from three geographic sites (Stavely in AB, Milroy in the Kootenay trench, BC and Goose Lake on the BC interior plateau) with divergent grazing histories were vegetatively propagated from tillers. Daughter plants were planted into two field nurseries (at Kamloops, BC, and Stavely, AB) and morphological measurements were taken in two field seasons post-establishment. Plants from all three populations were taller, flowered earlier, and were more productive at the Kamloops nursery site. Of the three geographic sources, plants from the Goose Lake site were most distinct with narrower leaves, later flowering, and greater yield. Plants with a long history of grazing had slightly shorter fertile tillers and leaves than plants with a history of long-term protection.																			0008-4220	1918-1833				JAN	2014	94	1					33	39		10.4141/CJPS2013-181	http://dx.doi.org/10.4141/CJPS2013-181													WOS:000329461700004

Recreational water reservoirs are a potential reservoir of pathogenic fungi. The aim of the study was to assess the diversity of mycobiota in selected artificial bathing reservoirs with regard to its biosafety for the human population. The studies were conducted during the summer of 2016 in three research seasons (June (I), July and August (II), and September (III)), taking into account the various periods of recreational activities. Filamentous fungi were isolated from water samples collected at five different ponds utilized for recreation. From 162 water samples, 149 fungal taxa of filamentous fungi were identified: 140 were classified to species level and only nine to genus level. Aspergillus fumigatus was the dominant species. The highest species richness (S) was noted in June, with 93 fungal taxa (Menhinick's index from 2.65 to 4.49). Additionally, in season I, the highest diversity of fungal species was revealed (Simpson's diversity index from 0.83 to 0.99). The average number of CFU/1 mL sample ranged between 0.4 and 4.6 depending on the time of sampling and ponds. Of all the isolated species, 128 were clinically relevant (11 from RG-2 and 117 from RG-1), highlighting the need to introduce seasonal mycological monitoring of such reservoirs.					; Blaszkowska, Joanna/S-9376-2016	Dzikowiec, Magdalena/0000-0002-4044-6424; Goralska, Katarzyna/0000-0002-1359-8879; 													1477-8920					APR	2020	18	2					127	144		10.2166/wh.2020.096	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wh.2020.096								32300087					WOS:000528755500004
J	Roy, R; Majumder, M				Roy, Ritabrata; Majumder, Mrinmoy			Assessment of water quality trends in Loktak Lake, Manipur, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Loktak Lake is the largest natural freshwater lake of Northeastern India, characteristic by floating islands, known as Phumdis. The lake supports rich biodiversity including some globally threatened species, hence declared as a Ramsar Site. The lake facilitates hydropower, irrigation and provides a livelihood to the local villagers in the form of fishing and agriculture. Loktak Lake is deteriorating in recent years due to rapid urbanization, increased settlement and other anthropogenic activities. A study was, therefore, undertaken to assess the water quality and its trends for this important lake. The water quality of Loktak Lake was assessed in monthly intervals for a period of 3 years, using multiple water quality indices. Temporal distribution functions of the individual water quality parameters and indices were developed to assess the water quality trend of the lake. Overall water quality of this lake was found to be good throughout the year with slight deterioration during winter. However, the water of this lake was a little turbid and contained significant organic load.

Effect of aridity and rainfall seasonality on vegetation in the southern tropics of East Africa during the Pleistocene/Holocene transition	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Fossil pollen analyses from northern Lake Malawi, southeast Africa, provide a high-resolution record of vegetation change during the Pleistocene/Holocene transition (similar to 18-9 ka). Recent studies of local vegetation from lowland sites have reported contrasting rainfall signals during the Younger Drya5 (YD). The Lake Malawi record tracks regional vegetation changes and allows comparison with other tropical African records identifying vegetation opening and local forest maintenance during the YD. Our record shows a gradual decline of afromontane vegetation at 18 ka. Around 14.5 ka, tropical seasonal forest and Zarnbezian miombo woodland became established. At similar to 13 ka, drier, more open formations gradually became prevalent. Although tropical seasonal forest taxa were still present in the watershed during the YD, this drought-intolerant forest type was likely restricted to areas of favorable edaphic conditions along permanent waterways. The establishment of drought-tolerant vegetation followed the reinforcement of southeasterly tradewinds resulting in a more pronounced dry winter season after similar to 11.8 ka. The onset of the driest, most open vegetation type was coincident with a lake low stand at the beginning of the Holocene. This study demons.:rates the importance of global climate forcing and local geomorphological conditions in controlling vegetation distribution. (C) 2011 University of Washington.

Woodlands and their products played a key role in the production of tools and weapons, and provided unique resources for constructions and fuel. Therefore wooden finds are essential in gaining insights into climatic and land use changes but also societal development during the Holocene. Dendroarchaeological investigations, based on tree rings, wood anatomy and techno-morphological characteristics are of great importance for a better understanding of past chronological processes as well as human-environment-interactions. Here we present an overview of the sources, methods, and concepts of this interdisciplinary field of dendroarchaeology focusing on Europe, where several tree-ring chronologies span most of the Holocene. We describe research examples from different periods of human history and discuss the current state of field. The long settlement history in Europe provides a myriad of wooden archeological samples not only for dating but also offer exciting new findings at the interface of natural and social sciences and the humanities.					; Seim, Andrea/MGU-8729-2025; Skiadaresis, Georgios/AAB-9971-2021; Tegel, Willy/M-8187-2014	Muigg, Bernhard/0000-0003-2731-2672; 													2296-701X					FEB 16	2022	10								823622	10.3389/fevo.2022.823622	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2022.823622													WOS:000764338100001
J	Jones, RI; Young, JM; Hartley, AM; BaileyWatts, AE				Jones, RI; Young, JM; Hartley, AM; BaileyWatts, AE			Light limitation of phytoplankton development in an oligotrophic lake - Loch Ness, Scotland	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The underwater light climate in Loch Ness is described in terms of mixing depth (Z(m)) and depth of the euphotic zone (Z(eu)). During periods of complete mixing, Z(m) equates with the mean depth of the loch (132 m), but even during summer stratification the morphometry of the loch and the strong prevailing winds produce a deep thermocline and an epilimnetic mixed layer of about 30 m or greater. Hence, throughout the year the quotient Z(m)/Z(eu) is exceptionally high and the underwater light climate particularly unfavourable for phytoplankton production and growth. 2. Phytoplankton biomass expressed as chlorophyll a is very low in Loch Ness, with a late summer maximum of less than 1.5 mg chlorophyll a m(-3) in the upper 30 m of the water column. This low biomass and the resulting very low photosynthetic carbon fixation within the water column are evidence that a severe restraint is imposed on the rate at which phytoplankton can grow in the loch. 3. The chlorophyll a content per unit of phytoplankton biovolume and the maximum, light-saturated specific rate of photosynthesis are both parameters which might be influenced by the light climate under which the phytoplankton have grown. However, values obtained from Loch Ness for both chlorophyll a content (mean 0.0045 mg mm(-3)) and maximum photosynthetic rate (1-4 mg C mg Chla h(-1)) are within the range reported from other lakes. 4. Laboratory bioassays with the natural phytoplankton community from Loch Ness on two occasions in late summer when the light climate in the loch is at its most favourable, suggest that even then Limitation of phytoplankton growth is finely balanced between light and phosphorus limitation. Hence, for most of the year, when the light climate is less favourable, phytoplankton growth will be light limited. 5. Quotients relating mean annual algal biomass as chlorophyll a (c. 0.5 mg Chla m(-3)) and the probable annual specific areal loading of total phosphorus (0.4-1.7 g m m(-2) yr(-1)) suggest that the efficiency with which phytoplankton is produced in Loch Ness per unit of TP loading is extremely low when compared with values from other Scottish lochs for which such an index has been calculated. This apparent inefficiency can be attributed to suppression of photosynthetic productivity in the water column due to the unfavourable underwater light climate. 6. These several independent sources of evidence lead to the conclusion that phytoplankton development in Loch Ness is constrained by light rather than by nutrients. Loch Ness thus appears to provide an exception to the generally accepted paradigm that phytoplankton development in lakes of an oligotrophic character is constrained by nutrient availability.

Hydrodynamic Variability of an Intermittently Closed Estuary over Interannual, Seasonal, Fortnightly, and Tidal Timescales	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Small low-inflow intermittently closed estuaries are common in Mediterranean climates worldwide; however, despite their important contributions to ecosystem services and coastal resilience, their dynamics have been less well studied relative to classical (i.e., deeper, persistent freshwater inflow) estuaries. It is known that infragravity wave propagation into these estuaries can induce strong currents and that closures lead to stagnating flows and declining water quality; however, how the estuarine circulation (tidal and subtidal) dynamically drives and responds to these conditions remains largely unknown. Here we analyze over 4 years of hydrodynamic observations in Los Penasquitos Lagoon, a low-inflow, intermittently closed estuary in Southern California, to examine wave propagation into the estuary, sill accretion, and the estuarine circulation response over tidal, fortnightly, seasonal, and interannual time scales, providing an unprecedented view as to how these systems respond to changing forcing. Wave observations near the estuary inlet show that wave energy inside the inlet, which contributes to sill accretion, is dependent on water level relative to the sill height and has a tidal variation due to wave-current interactions. Tidal phase averages of conditions during open, pre-closure, spring, neap, and closed conditions highlight the large dynamic range that these estuaries experience. During open, low sill conditions, circulation and stratification are consistent with stratification-induced periodic straining and subtidal exchange varies with the fortnightly cycle as observed in many classical estuaries. However, as the sill grows, tidal circulation weakens and becomes strongly sheared and the subtidal exchange no longer scales with a classical theoretical pressure-friction balance.

Heterotrophic bacteria from an extremely phosphate-poor lake have conditionally reduced phosphorus demand and utilize diverse sources of phosphorus	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Heterotrophic Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were isolated from Lake Matano, Indonesia, a stratified, ferruginous (iron-rich), ultra-oligotrophic lake with phosphate concentrations below 50nM. Here, we describe the growth of eight strains of heterotrophic bacteria on a variety of soluble and insoluble sources of phosphorus. When transferred to medium without added phosphorus (P), the isolates grow slowly, their RNA content falls to as low as 1% of cellular dry weight, and 86-100% of the membrane lipids are replaced with amino- or glycolipids. Similar changes in lipid composition have been observed in marine photoautotrophs and soil heterotrophs, and similar flexibility in phosphorus sources has been demonstrated in marine and soil-dwelling heterotrophs. Our results demonstrate that heterotrophs isolated from this unusual environment alter their macromolecular composition, which allows the organisms to grow efficiently even in their extremely phosphorus-limited environment.					; Jones, CarriAyne/K-1906-2012; Elling, Felix/B-2149-2015; Elling, Felix J./B-2149-2015; Hinrichs, Kai-Uwe/C-7675-2009; Antoniewicz, Maciek/D-4015-2009	Maresca, Julia/0000-0002-3955-1585; Jones, CarriAyne/0000-0002-7196-5825; Elling, Felix J./0000-0003-0405-4033; Hinrichs, Kai-Uwe/0000-0002-0739-9291; Nomosatryo, Sulung/0000-0002-3233-1440; Antoniewicz, Maciek/0000-0002-0087-2875; 													1462-2912	1462-2920				FEB	2016	18	2					656	667		10.1111/1462-2920.13063	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.13063								26415900					WOS:000371232600030

Phosphorus Removal in a Surface-Flow Constructed Wetland Treating Agricultural Runoff	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Agricultural runoff is a leading source of phosphorus (P) pollution to lakes and streams. The objective of this study was to evaluate P removal dynamics in a constructed treatment wetland (CTW) treating agricultural irrigation return flows. The CTW included a sedimentation basin (SB) followed by two surface-flow wetlands in parallel. Typical retention times and total P (TP) loading were 1.4 d and 50 to 110 g m(-2) yr(-1) P, respectively, for the SB and 5 to 6 d and 4 to 10 g m(-2) yr(-1) P, respectively, for wetlands. On the basis of this multiyear study, concentration removal efficiency in the SB averaged 21% for TP and 32% for reactive phosphorus (RP). Concentration removal efficiency in wetlands averaged 37 and 43% for TP and 22 and 33% for RP. Areal first-order removal rates for TP averaged 22 and 31 m yr(-1) in wetlands. Total P removal in wetlands exhibited a strong seasonal pattern, with minimum removal in the summer when high temperatures likely enhanced P release from decaying plant biomass. The performance of the CTW was stochastic, with removal unpredictably poorer in some years in part as a result of muskrat bioturbation and plant harvesting. In years before muskrat impacts, concentration removal efficiencies in wetlands were 50% for TP and 65% for RP.																			0047-2425	1537-2537				MAY-JUN	2014	43	3					1071	1080		10.2134/jeq2013.11.0463	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2013.11.0463								25602836					WOS:000336275700030

Concentrations of MC variants (MC-LR, -RR, and -YR) in the multimedia samples were analyzed using a HPLCMS/MS. Trophic position (TP) of organisms (fish, bivalve, gastropod, decapod, and polychaete) was determined by nitrogen stable isotope analyses of both bulk tissues and amino acids. From July to August 2017, great concentrations of MCs were detected in discharged freshwater ranging from 0.4 to 75 mu g L-1. Considerable amounts of MCs are delivered to the Geum River Estuary in summer season. MCs spread far away as dissolved phases (18.7-49.5 mu g L-1) in July when large amount of freshwater was discharged during the rainy season. Concentrations of MCs in marine organisms varied among species, ranging from 40 to 870 mu g g(-1) dw. Bioaccumulated MCs tend to decrease with increasing TP of organisms, suggesting that MCs are biodiluted through the marine food web. Compound-specific isotope analysis (nitrogen of amino acids) provides more reliable TPs compared with those by bulk isotope analysis in a closed estuary (such as the Geum River Estuary) with large fluctuations in the isotope ratio of primary producers.

The pair bond between black-headed gulls is formed in a colony after the gulls come back from wintering grounds. The formed pairs can be broken up and each mate form a new pair with another gull. The gulls can change several mates before breeding. The majority of males and females copulate with several mates before breeding. Changes in the area of nest territory and in aggressiveness, comfort and mating behavior of males during the pair formation are considered. Nest building is the only reliable indication that the pair will not break up. In the black-headed gull a complicated choice of mates may take place.

Beavers (Castor canadensis) facilitate early access by Canada geese (Branta canadensis) to nesting habitat and areas of open water in Canada's boreal wetlands	MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY												Several studies demonstrate how beavers influence waterfowl habitat availability, ultimately improving waterfowl breeding success; however, no current research links beavers to early season nesting activities of Canada geese (Branta canadensis) in northern climates. We examined how beavers facilitate early access to open water for geese at Miquelon Lake Provincial Park (MLPP), Canada. We surveyed 32 active and 39 inactive beaver ponds to examine whether beavers facilitate early access to open water. Open water occurred 10.7 days earlier at active beaver ponds (mean ice-off day = 87.54,s = 13.88) than inactive ponds (mean ice-off day = 98.19, s = 9.07), especially adjacent to main lodge entrances and winter food caches. Snowpack was on average 5.9 cm shallower at active ponds. Prior to availability of open water, Canada geese exhibited intraspecific territoriality over beaver lodges as nest sites and once water was present, preferred island lodges over bank lodges. These findings support other studies that examined island nesting as protection from terrestrial predators and highlight the importance of beavers in creating open water areas earlier in the season.

The method applied in the studied lake aimed at reducing phosphorous availability through the chemical precipitation of its excess mineral forms in the water body and limiting their mobility in the bottom sediments. Restoration efforts led to shifts in the phytoplankton domination structure followed by the inhibition of blue-green algae development. In consequence, a significant decrease was recorded in the growth rate of the phytoplankton community.

Water is essential for human existence, and due to the changing environment, it has become a scarce natural resource. Hot, dry summers, which are becoming more frequent, significantly increase the length and frequency of drought periods, and thus increase the need for irrigation in agriculture. Watering plantations is essential to maintain food security, and in addition to limiting the water resources, it reduces access for other water users. As a result of this, in the summer season, the water availability of the reservoirs and the water level of the lakes are lower, which negatively affects tourism, recreational opportunities and the availability of water sports. Distributing water resources among potential water users results in conflicts, and solving these issues is considered to be the task of water professionals, although this is a multidisciplinary assignment. The cooperation of stakeholders and social involvement, as well as maintaining a good status of the environment, and providing an overall economic assessment are part of the evaluation process. Determining the value and utility of water differs depending on the time, place, and application. Good water management can contribute to economic growth, social well-being, proportional distribution of water in scarce years, and thus to the reduction of water related conflicts. By determining the value of water, decision makers receive a tool to create a thoroughly considered and well-founded water distribution method which, if necessary, can serve as the basis for sustainable water replenishment solutions. The water resources of the catchment of Lake Velence, despite the surrounding partly hilly territorial character, have limited replenishment. Extreme drought periods over the last few years have resulted in record low water levels in the lake and increased water-related conflicts. A questionnaire survey was conducted among water users in order to determine the value of water, and 840 responses were obtained. In addition to creating an overview of the physical condition of the water resources in the watershed, their willingness to pay for better/more water was also assessed. In both cases - the improvement of the amount and/or the quality of water - responders were asked about their willingness to contribute either occasionally and/or on an annual basis. The respondents were divided into three large groups: permanent residents, temporary residents and tourists. More than one third of all respondents considered the adequate quantity and quality of water to be a state task, so they did not want to make any further financial contributions above the taxes that are already being paid. On the other hand, the great majority - almost 2/3 of people - would support these efforts from their own wallets. Based on the sums of their payment contributions, considering water as a different economic good, we determined the value of the water unit belonging to the current state, among the different water users. Knowing the value of water among all water users of the watershed allows decision makers to distribute the scarce water resources based on economic assessments, and to fairly compensate those stakeholders that suffer losses due to water reallocation. Furthermore, in case of investment decisions, the extent of the contribution by the actual water users with their beneficiaries can be determined. Using this valuation methodology, even though water is a public good, the individual benefits and advantages achieved by having surplus due to water redistribution or replenishment, or better quality of water, can be quantified. The value function of water is a complex function with many variables, therefore its determination can support detailed, cross-sectoral economic assessments and can be transformed to investment decisions. Furthermore, stakeholders suffering losses due to the scarce or reallocated water resources, e.g. in extreme drought summers, can be compensated from the profits of gaining stakeholders.																			2706-3801						2025							331	349																WOS:001512881800018
J	Bischoff, JL; Rosenbauer, RJ				Bischoff, JL; Rosenbauer, RJ			The alteration of rhyolite in CO2 charged water at 200 and 350 degrees C: The unreactivity of CO2 at higher temperature	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Geochemical and hydrologic modeling indicates that geothermal waters in the T > 270 degrees C reservoirs beneath Yellowstone National Park have HCO3 much less than Cl and contrast with waters in reservoirs at lower temperatures which attain HCO3 about equal to Cl. Experiments reacting rhyolite with 0.5 molal solutions of CO2 at 200 degrees and 350 degrees C were carried out to test the hypothesis of Fournier (1981, 1989) to explain the chemistry of these springs: that CO2 is relatively unreactive with volcanic rocks at temperatures > 270 degrees C. The experimental results strongly support this hypothesis. Extent of alteration is twenty-seven times greater at 200 degrees C than at 350 degrees C. The dominant process in the experiments appears to be the alteration of the albitic component of the rhyolite by dissolved CO2 to form a kaolinite-like alteration product plus quartz: 2NaAlSi(3)O(8) + 2CO(2) + 3H(2)O = 2Na(+) + 2HCO(3)(-) + Al2Si2O5(OH)(4) + 4SiO(2). CO2 reacts with water to form H2CO3 which dissociates to H+ and HCO3-, more so at lower temperatures. Kinetic and thermodynamic considerations suggest that the reactivity of H2CO3 With wallrocks is at its maximum between 150 degrees and 200 degrees C, consuming most of the H+ and liberating equivalent amounts of cations and bicarbonate. Wallrocks in higher temperature reservoirs are relatively unreactive to dissolved CO2 which is eventually lost from the system by boiling. These observations also offer a possible explanation for the change in chemical sediments from chloride-dominated to bicarbonate-dominated salts found in the stratigraphic section at Searles Lake, California, the terminus of the Owens River which derives its dissolved load from hot springs of the Long Valley caldera.																			0016-7037					OCT	1996	60	20					3859	3867		10.1016/0016-7037(96)00208-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(96)00208-6													WOS:A1996VN49500007
J	Simonetti, A; Gariépy, C; Carignan, J				Simonetti, A; Gariépy, C; Carignan, J			Pb and Sr isotopic evidence for sources of atmospheric heavy metals and their deposition budgets in northeastern North America	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Concentrations of Al, Ba, Cd, Cu, Mg, Mn, Pb, Rb, Sr, and Zn, as well as Pb and Sr isotopic compositions were determined in samples of snowpack obtained during the 1998 winter season from northeastern North America. Median enrichment factors, relative to upper crustal abundances, for Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb, and Zn for all samples range from ca. 50 to 36,000 and are indicative of an anthropogenic origin. The Pb isotope ratios correlate with geographic location because snowpack from eastern Ontario and the northeastern USA are characterized by the most radiogenic Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios (ca. 1.18-1.19), and these decrease systematically in an easterly direction towards the Atlantic coast(ca. 1.16). The ph isotope data for the 1998 samples of snowpack indicate that atmospheric pollution in this region of North America is dominated solely by a mixture of anthropogenic emissions from US (Pb-206/Pb-207 Ca. 1.20) and Canadian (Pb-206/Pb-207 ca. 1.15) sources. This result contrasts with that obtained for 1997 snowpack from similar geographic regions, because the Ph isotope data for the latter suggest the involvement of an additional anthropogenic component, possibly that of Eurasian pollution transported over the high Arctic. This difference in the distribution pattern of atmospheric pollution over northeastern North America between the 1997 and 1998 winter seasons may be related to the El Nino phenomenon. Sr isotope data for ail the 1998 snowpack samples define a large range in Sr-87/Sr-86 Values but most are between 0.709 to 0.710, similar to the value of present-day seawater (ca. 0.7092). However, the majority of snowpack samples from eastern Ontario are characterized by lower Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (<0.709), and these correlate negatively with their enrichment factors of Pb. Such trends suggest the presence of a relatively 'unradiogenic' source of anthropogenic Sr, possibly related to emissions from coal-fired power plants located in the western and midwestern regions of the USA. Annual depositional budgets estimated from 1998 snowpack indicate that those for Pb, Cd, and Cu are highest in eastern Ontario, and significantly lower in the remaining regions. The former reflect a "meteorological corridor" in northeastern North America, which coincides with heavily industrialized and densely populated areas. Depositional budgets of Zn are extremely high in all areas investigated and their exact source(s) remains enigmatic. These may reflect either an increase in atmospheric industrial emissions (since the 1980s), a lower residence time in the atmosphere, or particular chemical speciation that affects the deposition of Zn from the lower troposphere. Depositional budgets for Mn are also high and may be related to the combustion of Mn-bearing fossil fuels by automotive vehicles. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We observed a high degree of spatial variability in Cladophora deposition among beaches on Lake Michigan, even within local regions, with no clear regional pattern in the intensity of Cladophora deposition. A strong seasonal pattern in Cladophora deposition was observed, with the heaviest deposition occurring during mid-summer. Several beaches exhibited high temporal variability in Cladophora deposition over short time scales, suggesting that drifting algal mats may be extremely dynamic in nearshore environments of the Great Lakes. Cladophora deposition on Lake Michigan beaches was primarily related to the presence of nearshore structures, local population density, and nearshore bathymetry. There was relatively little evidence that waves, winds, or currents were associated with Cladophora deposition on beaches, but this may be due to the relatively poor resolution of existing nearshore hydrodynamic data. Developing a predictive understanding of beach-cast Cladophora dynamics in Great Lakes environments may require both intensive Cladophora monitoring and fine-scale local hydrodynamic modeling efforts.

Five specimens were found in samples from macrophyte stands of Myriophyllum spicatum (L.) and Ceratophyllum demersum (L.) with associated invertebrates, in Lake Sakadas in the Kopacki rit floodplain. From environmental monitoring data of Kopacki rit, no important effect from the presence of this species has been recorded yet. However, according to its biological attributes, especially a short life span and generation time, protection of its juveniles, non-specific food preference, and suspension feeding, L. benedeni is characterized as a successful Ponto-Caspian invader, so monitoring of this species in Croatian inland waters is important.

Flood, drought and the inter-annual variation to the number and size of ponds and small wetlands in an English lowland landscape over three years of weather extremes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Ponds are biodiversity hotspots, but pond conservation is hampered by problems auditing these small, often temporary, habitats. Data on temporal changes to the number of ponds in response to weather variations are lacking. Annual and seasonal changes to the numbers and area of wetted ponds in a lowland farm in England were surveyed by field walks between November 2010 and November 2013. Plant communities were recorded to identify variations in pond type between land-uses. The study period coincided with severe drought up until April 2012 followed by record breaking precipitation. The wetted areas of ponds in wetlands and dune slacks showed the strongest relationship with rainfall over the preceding 4-6 months, whilst the areas of ponds in arable or pasture fields varied more with rainfall in the previous month. Ponds from different land-uses supported different plant communities and all types added to the overall total site biodiversity. Plant communities of ponds in arable fields benefitted from the extreme wet summer of 2012. The results show that the number and area of ponds varied significantly between years and seasons and that different pond types in different land-uses may vary in their response to extreme weather.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2016	768	1					255	272		10.1007/s10750-015-2554-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-015-2554-0													WOS:000369001400018

Lifelong divergence of growth patterns in Arctic charr life history strategies: implications for sustainable fisheries in a changing climate	ARCTIC SCIENCE												Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus Linnaeus, 1758) are phenotypically variable with multiple life history strategies including anadromous and freshwater resident individuals. The mechanism determining life history is believed to be set early in life. Anadromous individuals show greater seasonality in growth and feeding after the first seaward migration relative to resident conspecifics. We used otolith growth increment measurements to estimate lifelong growth patterns for 355 individuals with anadromous or resident life history from four populations within Cumberland Sound, Nunavut. Using a general and a generalized linear model, we discovered a linear increase (estimate = 0.006) in growth for both Arctic charr life histories between 1990 and 2016. Resident Arctic charr have lower annual growth (estimate = -0.176) and show a decrease in the annual proportion of summer growth as they age (estimate = -0.042), whereas their anadromous counterparts maintain a higher seasonality in their growth patterns with age. This suggests that growth is indeed important in life history trajectory for Arctic charr and that seasonal growth patterns differ among life histories. The results highlight the importance of improving our understanding of mechanisms influencing life history trajectory in Arctic charr to ensure sustainability of harvested Arctic charr populations in a changing climate.																				2368-7460				JUN	2021	7	2			SI		454	470		10.1139/as-2019-0032	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/as-2019-0032													WOS:000672826800006

Effectiveness of hypolimnetic oxygenation for preventing accumulation of Fe and Mn in a drinking water reservoir	WATER RESEARCH												The accumulation of Fe and Mn in seasonally stratified drinking water reservoirs adversely impacts water quality. To control issues with Fe and Mn at the source, some drinking water utilities have deployed hypolimnetic oxygenation systems to create well-oxygenated conditions in the water column that are favorable for the oxidation, and thus removal, of Fe and Mn. However, in addition to being controlled by dissolved oxygen (DO), Fe and Mn concentrations are also influenced by pH and metal-oxidizing microorganisms. We studied the response of Fe and Mn concentrations to hypolimnetic oxygenation in a shallow drinking water reservoir in Vinton, Virginia, USA by sequentially activating and deactivating an oxygenation system over two summers. We found that maintaining well-oxygenated conditions effectively prevented the accumulation of soluble Fe in the hypolimnion. However, while the rate of Mn oxidation increased under well-oxygenated conditions, soluble Mn still accumulated in the slightly acidic to neutral (pH 5.6 to 7.5) hypolimnion. In parallel, we conducted laboratory incubation experiments, which showed that the presence of Mn-oxidizing microorganisms increased the rate of Mn oxidation in comparison with rates under oxic, abiotic conditions. Combined, our field and laboratory results demonstrate that increasing DO concentrations in the water column is important for stimulating the oxidation of Fe and Mn, but that the successful management of Mn is also tied to the activity of Mn-oxidizing organisms in the water column and favorable (neutral to alkaline) pH.

Possible connections between the abundance of non-nucleoid-containing cells (non-Nu CC) and viral abundance were also examined. The water used in the experiments was collected from the mesotrophic Lake Erken (Sweden) in late autumn. In both experiments, nutrient addition resulted in increases in viral abundance and non-nucleoid-containing bacterial cells. However, in the P- and N-limited cultures, P addition resulted in increases in viral abundance and non-nucleoid-containing bacterial cells, but no increase in bacterial abundance. In contrast, in the cultures to which N was added, increases in viral abundance were accompanied by increases in the abundance of both bacteria and non-nucleoid-containing cells. The results show that there is a connection between changes in the abundance of viruses and non-nucleoid-containing cells. However, there are indications that viral abundance can change in response to changes in the P status of the environment without any increase in bacterial abundance.

M.; Rogers, Neil			Lithogeochemical and isotopic characterization of Devonian molybdenite mineralization in the Pabineau Falls Granite, northeastern New Brunswick, Canada	JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION												An unusual molybdenite occurrence in northeastern New Brunswick, referred to herein as the Pabineau Lake Mo (PLM), is situated to the south of Bathurst. This occurrence consists of high-grade molybdenite-bearing granites that occur within the large Pabineau Falls Granite (PFG). To help evaluate the evolution of this occurrence, a large composite sample containing disseminated, very coarse molybdenite (up to 5.02 wt% MoS2) was collected from mineralized granitic blocks excavated from a blasted trench. Although the host rocks are assumed to be PFG, being the only defined intrusive body in the area, major- and trace-element geochemical data together with U-Pb geochronological results suggest that the molybdenite is hosted by an intrusion distinct from the PFG. The radiogenic Sr-Nd-Hf-Pb isotopic data of the host intrusion are consistent with Gander Zone granites of the Appalachians orogenic system. The PLM's granitic host rock is characterized by a high silica content (78.93 wt% SiO2), an enrichment in incompatible elements, and a high molybdenum content. The high initial Sr-87/Sr-86 of 0.71268, negative ENd of -1.28, and high Pb isotope ratios together with trace- and major-element concentrations indicate a moderately to highly radiogenic Sr source and derivation from a significant amount of supracrustal materials, with a contribution from the upper mantle; a source similar to that proposed for the Gander Zone Siluro-Devonian granitic bodies. A positive epsilon Hf (+1.34) also suggests involvement of sedimentary components. This is consistent with elevated Cr (20 ppm) and Ni (20 ppm). The involvement of a pelagic sedimentary component is invoked to explain the enrichment in elements commonly associated with mafic compositions. A new precise, LA ICP-MS zircon crystallization age of 390 +/- 1 Ma makes the PLM host granite Middle Devonian, which argues against a direct relationship with the older PFG (397.2 +/- 1.9 Ma). The new age opens the possibility of an as yet undelineated, mineralized intrusion within the Gander Zone, which has perhaps been missed during previous investigations due to the extensive glacio-fluvial cover and very limited bedrock exposures. Alternatively, the younger age could be attributed to very slow cooling and/or intra-pluton fractionation, resulting in a younger much more fractionated phase of the PFG. However, there is no geochemical evidence for such a prolonged continuous fractional crystallization process. Notably, recent geophysical surveys on the Bathurst Mining Camp indicate that the PFG is substantively larger than its surface expression as it continues to the east beneath the Carboniferous unconformity. Comparing ages of PLM and PFG with the nearby Nicholas-Denys Granodiorite (381 +/- 4 Ma) and Antinouri Lake Granite (372 +/- 4 Ma), it appears that magmatic activity in the region occurred every 10 Myr over a span of about 30 Myr. Collectively, this evidence suggests the potential of significant buried intrusions within this tectonic belt of the Gander Zone. At the PLM, this might include exposure of an otherwise hidden intrusion that is younger and much more fractionated than the PFG. More detailed geophysical and geochemical analyses would be required to revise the current geological map and, most importantly, trace unmapped units at depth to possible additional mineralized sequences.

Do rivermouths alter nutrient and seston delivery to the nearshore?	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Tributary inputs to lakes and seas are often measured at riverine gages, upstream of lentic influence. Between these riverine gages and the nearshore zones of large waterbodies lie rivermouths, which may retain, transform and contribute materials to the nearshore zone. However, the magnitude and timing of these rivermouth effects have rarely been measured. During the summer of 2011, 23 tributary systems of the Laurentian Great Lakes were sampled from river to nearshore for dissolved and particulate carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations, as well as bulk seston and chlorophyll a concentrations. Three locations per system were sampled: in the upstream river, in the nearshore zone and at the outflow from the rivermouth to the lake. Using stable oxygen isotopes, a water-mixing model was developed to estimate the nutrient concentration that would occur at the rivermouth if mixing was strictly conservative (i.e. if no processing occurred within the rivermouth). Deviations between these conservative mixing estimates and measured nutrient concentrations were identified as rivermouth effects on nutrient concentrations. Rivermouths had higher concentration of C and P than nearshore areas and more chlorophyll a than upstream river waters. Compared to the conservative mixing model, rivermouths as a class appeared to be summer-time sources of N, P and chlorophyll a. Substantial among rivermouth variation occurred both in the effect size and direction for all constituents. Using principal component analysis, two groups of rivermouths were identified: rivermouths that had a large effect on most constituents and those that had very little effect on any of the measured constituents. High-effect' rivermouths had more abundant upstream croplands, which were presumably the sources of inorganic nutrients. Cross-validated models built using characteristics of the rivermouth were not good predictors of variation in rivermouth effects on most constituents. For consumers feeding on seston and microbes and vascular autotrophs directly taking up dissolved nutrients, rivermouths are more resource-rich than upstream riverine or nearby Great Lakes waters. Given declines over time in open-lake productivity within the Great Lakes, rivermouths may contribute more productivity than their size would suggest to the Great Lakes food web.					; Frost, Paul/AAT-6633-2021	Larson, James/0000-0002-6414-9758; Nelson, John/0000-0002-7105-0107; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				NOV	2016	61	11					1935	1949		10.1111/fwb.12827	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12827													WOS:000386022200010

Habitat structure and ecological drivers of disease	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Habitat can influence disease directly, through effects on hosts and parasites, or indirectly, through effects on ecological drivers of disease. We illustrated direct and indirect connections between habitat and outbreaks using a case study in the plankton. We sampled yeast epidemics in 18 populations of the lake zooplankter Daphnia dentifera. Lake size drove variation in two types of habitat structure, size of predation refuges and strength of stratification. Those habitat factors, in turn, indirectly linked to epidemics through two pathways involving nonhost species. In the first pathway, larger lakes had larger hypolimnetic refuges from vertebrate predation and greater densities of Daphnia pulicaria, a completely resistant species that can reduce disease risk for D. dentifera hosts by removing parasite spores from the environment. In lakes with more D. pulicaria, epidemics started later in autumn and remained smaller. In the second pathway, smaller lakes had shallower penetration of light, which correlated with stronger thermal stratification and higher densities of an invertebrate predator (Chaoborus) that spreads disease by releasing spores from infected hosts. Lakes with weaker stratification had fewer of these predators and smaller epidemics. In the second pathway, deeper light penetration may also decrease disease by imposing direct mortality on spores. Thus, this case study shows how habitat structure could influence epidemics through direct and indirect effects on the host-parasite system. Understanding these multiple mechanisms can enhance prediction of disease outbreaks as habitat modification continues in lakes and other ecosystems worldwide.

C.; O'Halloran, John			Relationship between plantation forest and brown trout growth, energetics and population structure in peatland lakes in western Ireland	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Much of the conifer plantation forest in Ireland is on peat soils. Plantations on this soil type are known to pose the greatest risk to degrading water quality by increased sedimentation, acidification and heavy metal accumulation. Peat soils are also known to leach phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as a result of forestry operations. In moderation, such nutrient enrichment may have positive trophic impacts in oligotrophic freshwater systems such as those typical of peat catchments in western Ireland. In this study, the water chemistry and brown trout (Salmo trutta) populations of peat-land lakes were investigated to assess the associations of conifer plantation forest on the growth, energetics and population structure of brown trout. We conducted this study over a three-month period in the summer of 2010 by comparing brown trout populations and water chemistry in lakes with three distinct catchment land uses: (i) unplanted blanket bog, (ii) moderate levels of conifer plantation forest (30-40% of catchment afforested), and (iii) high levels of conifer plantation forest (80-90% of catchment afforested). Changes in hydrochemistry associated with conifer plantations resulted in elevated concentrations of N, P and DOC, but no change to pH, with increasing levels of plantation forest within the catchment. Whereas there was no consistent trend in brown trout density between land uses, highest densities were recorded in lakes with afforested catchments. Trout populations in lakes with afforested catchments were dominated by younger fish, primarily 1+ (year old) and 2+ (2 year old) individuals with some 0+ (young of the year) trout present, compared to control lakes, which were largely dominated by 2+ and 3+ (3 year old) individuals. Older age classes of trout had larger body sizes in lakes with high levels of plantation forest within the catchment relative to the other lakes, indicating higher empirical growth rates, likely due to the trophic enrichment effects of forestry. Brown trout specific growth models that incorporate the potential confounding influence of different temperature regimes, showed no consistent relationship between growth and forest cover over the study period. Food consumption models indicated that trout in all sites were energetically challenged during the summer when sampling took place. Discrepancies between the observed body size and estimated growth of trout in lakes may potentially be due to (a) a significant amount of growth occurring outside of the summer study period and/or (b) unusually elevated temperature regimes during the study period, particularly in the afforested sites. No negative impacts of conifer plantation forests on brown trout populations were recorded. However, forest managers may wish to minimise felling coupe within peatland plantations as felling operations may exacerbate nutrient and/or heavy ion input into aquatic systems in such catchments.

Although these losses affect the greenhouse gas (GHG) budget of managed forests, it is unknown if they modify GHG emissions of recipient aquatic systems. To assess this question, air-water fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were quantified for humic lakes and their inlet streams in four boreal catchments using a before-after control-impact experiment. Two catchments were treated with forest clear-cuts followed by site preparation (18 % and 44 % of the catchment area). GHG fluxes and hydrological and physicochemical water characteristics were measured at multiple locations in lakes and streams at high temporal resolution throughout the summer season over a 4-year period. Both lakes and streams evaded all GHGs. The treatment did not significantly change GHG fluxes in streams or lakes within 3 years after the treatment, despite significant increases of CO2 and CH4 concentrations in hillslope groundwater. Our results highlight that GHGs leaching from forest clear-cuts may be buffered in the riparian zone-stream continuum, likely acting as effective biogeochemical processors and wind shelters to prevent additional GHG evasion via downstream inland waters. These findings are representative of low productive forests located in relatively flat landscapes where forestry practices cause only a limited initial impact on catchment hydrology and biogeochemistry.					; Klaus, Marcus/AAL-1818-2021; Laudon, Hjalmar/J-3074-2013	Klaus, Marcus/0000-0003-0747-3524; Laudon, Hjalmar/0000-0001-6058-1466; Bastviken, David/0000-0003-0038-2152													1726-4170	1726-4189				SEP 19	2018	15	18					5575	5594		10.5194/bg-15-5575-2018	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-5575-2018													WOS:000445040900002

Elemental concentration based potential ecological risk (PER) status of the surface sediments, Pulicat lagoon, Southeast coast of India	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Eighty-three surface sediments were collected to investigate the element concentration based sediment pollution and potential ecological risk status of the Pulicat lagoon, southeast coast of India. The textural characteristics, Fe and Mn concentration in the surface sediments are chiefly controlled by the confluence of riverine inputs and vicinity of the marine environment. The varied distribution of CaCO3 concentration is due to the depth of the lagoon followed by the sand and silty sand characteristics of the substratum. The surface sediments are derived from riverine sources. Sediment Pollution Index (SPI), Potential Ecological Risk Index of the sediments suggests that they are falling under less polluted and low potential ecological risk category.

Constraining Urban CO2 Emissions Using Mobile Observations from a Light Rail Public Transit Platform	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Urban environments are characterized by pronounced spatiotemporal heterogeneity, which can present sampling challenges when utilizing conventional greenhouse gas (GHG) measurement systems. In Salt Lake City, Utah, a GHG instrument was deployed on a light rail train car that continuously traverses the Salt Lake Valley (SLV) through a range of urban typologies. CO2 measurements from a light rail train car were used within a Bayesian inverse modeling framework to constrain urban emissions across the SLV during the fall of 2015. The primary objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate whether ground-based mobile measurements could be used to constrain urban emissions using an inverse modeling framework and (2) quantify the information that mobile observations provided relative to conventional GHG monitoring networks. Preliminary results suggest that ingesting mobile measurements into an inverse modeling framework generated a posterior emission estimate that more closely aligned with observations, reduced posterior emission uncertainties, and extends the geographical extent of emission adjustments.

Distinctive Patterns in the Taxonomical Resolution of Bacterioplankton in the Sediment and Pore Waters of Contrasted Freshwater Lakes	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Bacteria assemblages in lake sediments play a key role in various biogeochemical processes, yet their association with interstitial pore waters has been scarcely investigated. In this study, we utilized Illumina next-generation amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize the seasonal bacterial communities in the sediments and pore waters of three contrasted temperate freshwater lakes, namely Pavin, Aydat, and Grangent (French Massif Central). Despite occupying seemingly similar habitats, bacterial communities differed substantially between sediments and pore waters at all seasons with low sharing of operational taxonomic units (OTUs, 6.7 to 20.3%) between them. Sediment-associated bacteria were more rich and diverse than pore water bacteria, indicating a high heterogeneity in the sediment microhabitat. The changes in both sediment and pore water bacterial communities were lake and season specific. The bacterial community showed distinct differences between the lakes, with larger presence of strict anaerobes such as Syntrophus, Syntrophorhabdus, and Sulfuricurvum in the pore water and sediments of Pavin responsible for carbon and sulfur cycling. In both Aydat and Grangent, the hgcI_clade dominated throughout the study period in the pore waters. The higher representation of lesser-known transient members of lake communities such as Methylotenera in the pore waters of Aydat, and Clostridium and Sulfuricurvum in the pore and sediments of Grangent, respectively, were observed during the period of temporary anoxia in summer caused by lake stratification. Our study revealed that in the investigated lakes, the prevailing environmental factors across time and space structured and influenced the adaptation of bacterial communities to specific ecological niches.

Phytoplankton in Island and Material Lakes in the North of the European Part of Russia According to Summer Development Indicators	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Plankton communities are very important for the functioning of aquatic ecosystems [1, 2]. Phytoplankton is the dominant primary producer in the aquatic environment, from which most food webs begin, and which produces oxygen necessary for aquatic organisms [3]. Indicators of phytoplankton development are used to assess the ecological state of water bodies [4]. By quickly responding to changes in the aquatic environment, phytoplankton can serve as an indicator of the state of the entire ecosystem. Objective-A comparative analysis of the state of phytoplankton in two lakes experiencing anthropogenic pressure and located on the island territory of the Solovetsky archipelago and on the mainland of the Arkhangelsk oblast in the Northern Dvina River basin. Lake Bannoe (Gagarye) is located on the territory of Solovetsky village. Previously, a leather processing plant and a bathing facility of the monastery were located on its shore. Now there are buildings of the Solovetsky branch of the Arkhangelsk experimental algae plant. Lake Kholmovskoye is located in the Primorsky district of the Arkhangelsk oblast, 18 km from the city of Arkhangelsk. On the western shore of the lake is the village of Kholm and summer cottages. From the side of Lake Kholmovskoye, the village of Kholm is surrounded by an artificially dug ditch, into which all household drains flow. On the northern shore are former household premises. An operating cage trout farm is located in the water area of the lake, which is a source of additional organic matter entering the lake waters.					; Malkhasian, Iuliia/HIR-2099-2022; Matveev, Nikolay/HKN-7819-2023; Novoselov, Alexander/J-6926-2018; Dvoryankin, Gennady/HHM-4333-2022	Malkhasian, Iuliia/0000-0001-5387-3794; Matveev, Nikolai/0000-0001-8220-4063													1067-4136	1608-3334				OCT	2023	54	5					454	457		10.1134/S1067413623050077	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1067413623050077													WOS:001096973600009
J	Sun, JJ; Xia, YF; Yu, ZC				Sun, Jingjing; Xia, Yingfan; Yu, Zicheng			Ecological response of a high-elevation peatland to late Holocene hydroclimate change on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												High-elevation regions around the world have experienced pronounced climate change, resulting in a multitude of responses in terrestrial ecosystems. Here we used multi-proxy data-including dry bulk density, loss on ignition, plant macrofossils, diatoms, stable oxygen isotopes (S18Obulk) and C/N ratios-to understand the response of peatland vegetation and carbon accumulation to hydroclimate changes from two peat cores of a bamboo-sedge-Sphagnum peatland (27.621 degrees N, 98.590 degrees E; 3037 m asl) on the southern Hengduan Mountains at the southeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. The cores were dated by AMS 14C radiocarbon dates with a basal age of 4500 cal yr BP. The peatland was formed on an abandoned floodplain, as evidenced by the gravel and biotite at the base, likely in response to the weakening South Asian summer monsoon (SASM) in the late Holocene. From 4500 to 1300 cal yr BP, the gradual increase in the S18Obulk values-reflecting less intense convection in monsoon source regions and locally at time-indicates a continued weakening SASM and drying trend during the late Holocene. Furthermore, the low apparent carbon accumulation rate (aCAR) of 4 g C m- 2 yr- 1 during that time is likely due to the great decomposition of dominant bamboo-derived organic matter. The higher S18Obulk value at 1300-800 cal yr BP-possibly corresponding to the "Medieval Climate Anomaly" (MCA)-than the Little Ice Age (LIA) at 800-200 cal yr BP indicates a drier MCA, supported also by high charcoal content, low diatom abundance and high C/N ratios at our sites. The large difference of 8 parts per thousand in the S18Obulk values between the MCA and LIA suggests that local hydrological processes might have amplified the effect of monsoon-mediated hydroclimate on S18O variations. The higher aCAR during the MCA at 15 and 28 g C m- 2 yr- 1 for two cores than during the LIA at 13 and 18 g C m- 2 yr- 1 suggests that the relatively dry climate during the MCA promotes plant production and peat accumulation in this terrestrialized, still-wet and then sedge-dominated peatland. The increase of Sphagnum and other mosses and high S18Obulk values during the last 70 years reveal a dry local environment that is also confirmed by the decreasing precipitation and weakening SASM in instrumental climate records. Our results indicate that the development and carbon accumulation of this river-side peatland are sensitive to the changing monsoon strengths and hydroclimate, with strong modulations and amplifications by local hydrology and water sources on carbon accumulation.																			0277-3791	1873-457X				MAY 1	2025	355								109269	10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109269	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109269		MAR 2025											WOS:001441382900001

The site is embedded in a sedimentological sequence spanning from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 26.5-19/20 ka) to the Holocene (i.e., from MIS 2 to 1). Our findings are presented together with chronological, environmental, and climatic data. Luminescence dating provides a temporal framework for reoccupation of the Armenian Highlands after the LGM, while two vegetation proxies (pollen assemblages and leaf waxes) characterize the environment. Based on these pollen data, a quantitative climate reconstruction (temperatures and precipitation) is offered. Techno-typological characterization of the lithic assemblages is presented together with the sourcing of the entire obsidian assemblage by portable X-ray fluorescence, providing insights into the occupants' exploited territories. Such a framework, which incorporates both environmental reconstruction and hunter-gatherer behaviors, enables us to contextualize possible links between population dynamics during the height of the LGM and post-LGM environmental oscillations. We suggest that, during the LGM between ca. 24 and 19 ka, the combination of declining temperatures and the extension of the winter season limited the occupation feasibility of the region. The regional occupation resumed when environmental circumstances ameliorated. These results support our interpretation that temperatures and the duration of the seasons conditioned the past hunter-gatherer's occupation of the region.

J	Zhang, YX; Li, Y				Zhang Yuxin; Li Yu			Three modes of climate change since the Last Glacial Maximum in arid and semi-arid regions of the Asian continent	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES												The westerly winds and East Asian summer monsoon play a leading role in climate change of southwestern North America and eastern Asia since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), respectively. Their convergence in arid and semi-arid regions of the Asian continent (AAC) makes the regional climate change more complicated on the millennial-scale. There are still limitations in applying paleoclimate records and climate simulations of characteristic periods to investigate climate change patterns since the LGM in this region. In this study, we adopt two indexes indicating effective moisture and rely on a continuous simulation, a time slice simulation, and numerous paleoclimate records to comprehensively investigate the climate change modes and their driving mechanisms since the LGM in AAC. Results demonstrate a millennial-scale climate differentiation phenomenon and three climate change modes possibly occurring in AAC since the LGM. The western AAC largely controlled by the westerly winds is featured as wet climates during the LGM but relatively dry climates during the mid-Holocene (MH), coinciding with the climate change mode in southwestern North America. Conversely, dry conditions during the LGM and relatively wet conditions during the MH are reflected in eastern AAC governed by the East Asian summer monsoon, which leans to the climate change mode in eastern Asia. If climate change in central AAC is forced by the interaction of two circulations, it expresses wet conditions in both the LGM and MH, tending to a combination of the southwestern North American and eastern Asian modes. Precipitation and evaporation exert different intensities in influencing three climate modes of different periods. Furthermore, we identify the significant driving effects of greenhouse gases and ice sheets on westerly-dominated zones of AAC, while orbit-driven insolation on monsoon-dominated zones of AAC.

J	Brook, MS; Kirkbride, MP				Brook, Martin S.; Kirkbride, Martin P.			Reconstruction and paleoclimatic significance of late Quaternary glaciers in the Tararua Range, North Island, New Zealand	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Reconstructed mountain glaciers are routinely used as a proxy for climate in the search for evidence of interhemispheric climate fluctuations during the Quaternary. In New Zealand, valley glaciers at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) extended from an ice sheet centred on New Zealand's Southern Alps to below present-day sea level. In contrast, evidence of LGM glacial activity on the North Island is rare. Here, a glacioclimatic reconstruction is presented of two former glaciers in the Tararua Range (41 degrees S) in the southern North Island. At Mt. Aston, an isolated cirque basin contains landform evidence of a marginal niche glacier. At Park Valley, the lateral moraine of a larger cirque glacier has yielded published cosmogenic isotope ages. The paleoglacier reconstruction shows that paleoequilibrium line altitudes increased northwards across New Zealand during the local LGM. Hence, at this latitude only topography > 1200 m above present day sea-level was of sufficient elevation to allow small glaciers to form. The Mt Aston glacier covered only 0.18 km(2) with an equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of c. 1287 m above present sea level. A mean ELA glacier thickness of c. 25 m gives a basal shear stress at the ELA of c. 100 kPa(-1), with a mean summer (December, January, February, DJF) temperature at the ELA of no lower than 5.5 degrees C below present, below which precipitation would have been insufficient to support the reconstructed glacier. Implied LGM paleo-temperatures from both the ELA reconstruction and the glaciological reconstruction broadly accord with other paleo-temperature proxies from the North Island. Park Valley glacier covered c. 0.45 km(2) with an ELA of c. 1270 m and a mean ELA basal shear stress of 65 kPa. Its balance discharge was 9 x greater than at Mt Aston. It appears to have been glaciologically viable across a wide range of paleotemperatures: thus, the more marginal glacier is a more useful paleoclimatic indicator because it places a maximum limit on LGM temperature depression, which the larger glacier does not. ELAs of both glaciers closely approximate the regional LGM ELA trend surface. The paleo-glacier reconstructions imply that together with temperature driving LGM paleo-ELA depression, changes in south-westerly airflow over New Zealand, bringing moisture-laden but cool air, maximized snowfall and minimised winter melt. The corollary is that patterns of Quaternary glacier fluctuations may be interpreted as responses, at least in-part, to precipitation-driven changes, and secondly, North Island glaciation was probably more extensive than previously assumed.

The influence of R. acus larvae on the liver and pancreatic tissues of roach was examined histologically in additional material from 1989 and 1990. The inner organs of roach were most heavily infected with R. acus in the eutrophic, polluted Lake Vatia (63% of fish infected with 4.0 nematodes/fish) and in the two eutrophic lakes, compared to the oligotrophic Lake Peurunka (23%, 0.8). The prevalence of free R. acus larvae in the intestine of roach was almost as high but the intensity only about half of that found in the inner organs. The prevalence of infection had significantly higher values in autumn in most cases, and larvae accumulated in the inner organs and intestine of older roach. In histological studies it was found that larvae occurred more often in the pancreatic tissue than in the liver, but in both organs the majority of the larvae were dead and partly destroyed. The most typical host response against R. acus was a chronic ganulomatous inflammatory reaction. Granulomas and developing granulomas containing worms at different stages of degeneration are described; they were found in all of the lakes studied throughout the year and also in one and the same fish. On average only 37 and 21% of the worms in the liver and pancreas, respectively, were alive. No obvious difference in the histological response against R. ants was noted between the lakes.																			0020-7519	1879-0135				APR	1994	24	2					197	206		10.1016/0020-7519(94)90026-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0020-7519(94)90026-4								8026896					WOS:A1994NL84100006

However, only few studies to date have examined seasonal variations in virus-prokaryote interactions in marine environments. This study measured viral and prokaryotic abundance between January and November 2015 to assess seasonal variations in the relation between viruses and prokaryotes (heterotrophic bacteria, Synechococcus spp., and picoeukaryotes) in eutrophic semi-enclosed and less productivity open coastal waters. Viruses and prokaryotes were found to be significantly more abundant in productive semi-enclosed coastal waters. Using side scatter and green DNA dye complex fluorescence, we analyze flow cytometry (FCM) data to clearly distinguish between two groups of viruses, VLP1 and VLP2. VLP1, the most dominant, ranged from 84 - 89% and 67 - 78% in semi-enclosed and open coastal waters, respectively. Lower virus-to-bacteria ratios (VBR) were observed at semi-enclosed coastal waters (0.9 - 6.1), due to turbidity values of these two coastal waters being significantly different (4.5 - 6.2 NTU and 0.5 - 1.2 NTU, respectively) in summer, probably a result of higher suspended matter causing removal of viruses from the surface waters.

Mechanistic insights into how microcystin production and biodegradation by heterotrophic bacteria change spatially and throughout the bloom season can aid in toxin concentration forecasts. We quantified microcystin production and biodegradation during two growth seasons in two western Lake Erie sites with different physicochemical properties commonly plagued by summer Microcystis blooms. Microcystin production rates were greater with elevated nutrients than under ambient conditions and were highest nearshore during the initial phases of the bloom, and production rates were lower in later bloom phases. We examined biodegradation rates of the most common and toxic microcystin by adding extracellular stable isotope-labeled microcystin-LR (1 mu g L-1), which remained stable in the abiotic treatment (without bacteria) with minimal adsorption onto sediment, but strongly decreased in all unaltered biotic treatments, suggesting biodegradation. Greatest biodegradation rates (highest of -8.76 d(-1), equivalent to the removal of 99.98% in 18 h) were observed during peak bloom conditions, while lower rates were observed with lower cyanobacteria biomass. Cell-specific nitrogen incorporation from microcystin-LR by nanoscale imaging mass spectrometry showed that a small percentage of the heterotrophic bacterial community actively degraded microcystin-LR. Microcystin production and biodegradation rates, combined with the microcystin incorporation by single cells, suggest that microcystin predictive models could be improved by incorporating toxin production and biodegradation rates, which are influenced by cyanobacterial bloom stage (early vs. late bloom), nutrient availability, and bacterial community composition.					; Mayali, Xavier/JBJ-2272-2023; Weber, Peter/AAP-9517-2020	Stanislawczyk, Keara/0000-0002-9423-6860; Reitz, Laura/0000-0001-8185-0880; Chaffin, Justin/0000-0002-5372-4577; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2022	67	7					1470	1483		10.1002/lno.12096	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.12096		MAY 2022						36248197					WOS:000790261900001

In this study, water quality of Sultankoy (Ipsala District), Altinyazi (Uzunkopru District), Suloglu (Suloglu District), and Kadikoy (Kesan District) Dam Lakes, which were constructed by DSI (State Water Works) in order to provide irrigation water (Sultankoy and Altinyazi) and drinking water (Suloglu and Kadikoy) to the places where they are located on, were investigated. For this purpose, water samples were collected from the output locations of all the reservoirs in spring season of 2016. Total of 13 physiochemical water quality parameters (pH, conductivity, TDS, salinity, turbidity, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, sulfate, chemical oxygen demand, total carbon, total inorganic carbon and total organic carbon) were measured. Also Cluster Analysis (CA) was applied to detected data in order to classify the reservoirs in terms of contamination levels. According to detected data, pollution levels of the investigated dam lakes as follows; Sultankoy > Altinyazi > Kadikoy > Suloglu in general. According to the results of CA, 3 statistically significant clusters were formed, which were corresponded to Suloglu Dam Lake (Cluster 1); Kadikoy and Altinyazi Dam Lakes (Cluster 2); Sultankoy Dam Lake (Cluster 3).

In the Nunavik subarctic region (northern Quebec, Canada), these numerous, shallow ponds become well-stratified during summer. This creates a physico-chemical gradient of temperature and oxygen, with an upper oxic layer and a bottom low oxygen or anoxic layer. Our objective was to determine the influence of stratification and related limnological and landscape properties on the community structure of potentially active bacteria in these waters. Samples for RNA analysis were taken from ponds in three contrasting valleys across a gradient of permafrost degradation. A total of 1296 operational taxonomic units were identified by high throughput amplicon sequencing, targeting bacterial 16S rRNA that was reverse transcribed to cDNA, beta-proteobacteria were the dominant group in all ponds, with highest representation by the genera Variovorax and Polynucleobacter. Methanotrophs were also among the most abundant sequences at most sites. They accounted for up to 27% of the total sequences (median of 4.9% for all samples), indicating the importance of methane as a bacterial energy source in these waters. Both oxygenic (cyanobacteria) and anoxygenic (Chlorobi) phototrophs were also well-represented, the latter in the low oxygen bottom waters. Ordination analyses showed that the communities clustered according to valley and depth, with significant effects attributed to dissolved oxygen, pH, dissolved organic carbon, and total suspended solids. These results indicate that the bacterial assemblages of permafrost thaw ponds are filtered by environmental gradients, and are complex consortia of functionally diverse taxa that likely affect the composition as well as magnitude of greenhouse gas emissions from these abundant waters.

S	Lachniet, MS		Oviatt, CG; Shroder, JF		Lachniet, M. S.			A Speleothem Record of Great Basin Paleoclimate: The Leviathan Chronology, Nevada	LAKE BONNEVILLE: A SCIENTIFIC UPDATE	Developments in Earth Surface Processes											Speleothem studies from vadose-zone caves in the Great Basin have provided insight into the timing and controls of climatic change over the last 175,000 years. These studies integrate stable oxygen, carbon, and trace-element data to infer past temperature and wetness in the Great Basin, yielding new insights into the controls and timing on climate change on timescales ranging from centuries to orbital scales. This manuscript summarizes some of these records, with a focus on a long orbital-scale, oxygen-isotope reconstruction from Nevada called the Leviathan chronology, newly extended to 208,000 yr B2K (before year 2000). This speleothem-paleoclimate reconstruction is comprised of samples collected from Leviathan, Pinnacle, and Lehman Caves, Nevada, and shows orbital-scale variations in stable oxygen isotopes (delta O-18) that closely follow the variations in Milankovitch-controlled summer insolation in the northern hemisphere. The data show that glacial-interglacial terminations arrive "on-time" as expected from Milankovitch variations, and that their duration was set by insolation. The strong match between Great Basin delta O-18 values and insolation is also evident in minimum (cold) delta O-18 values during marine isotope stages (MIS) 5d and 7, when insolation was low despite minimal ice volume. Holocene climate variation followed the orbital insolation trend, and agrees with Antevs' formulation of a distinct altithermal interval in the Great Basin. Surprisingly, the timing of delta O-18 variations in the Leviathan chronology is markedly different to those originally published from Devils Hole, Nevada, suggesting that the phreatic origin of Devils Hole calcite may impart a nonclimatic forcing on calcite delta O-18 values. This observation is confirmed by new Devils Hole cores that generally support the discoveries enabled by the Leviathan chronology, but which show a delayed and dampened delta O-18 signal arising from dispersion in the regional carbonate aquifer.																			0928-2025		978-0-444-63594-5; 978-0-444-63590-7				2016	20						551	569		10.1016/B978-0-444-63590-7.00020-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-63590-7.00020-2													WOS:000409050100022
J	Ruttner, F				Ruttner, F			Remarks concerning the oxygen content of water and its respiratory value.	NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN												The respiration of an aquatic organism depends not alone upon the O2 content, but in large part upon the temp. O2 consumption is almost doubled by a rise of 10[degree]C. The same amount of O2 is worth about twice as much at 5 as at 15[degree]. In lakes having an O2 deficiency in the lower strata in summer, it is necessary to take the temp. of the water into consideration in order to ascertain the respiratory value of the dissolved O2 present. The statement of the results of O2 determinations in percentage of saturation is misleading, since the respiratory value is not taken into account.																			0028-1042	1432-1904					1926	14						1237	1239		10.1007/BF01451782	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01451782													WOS:000200263300264
J	Zhang, M; Lin, QQ; Xiao, LJ; Wang, S; Qian, X; Han, BP				Zhang, Man; Lin, Qiu-Qi; Xiao, Li-Juan; Wang, Sheng; Qian, Xin; Han, Bo-Ping			Effect of intensive epilimnetic withdrawal on the phytoplankton in a (sub)tropical deep reservoir	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Withdrawal is an important process in reservoir hydrodynamics, removing phytoplankton with flushed water. Zooplankton, the grazers of phytoplankton, having longer generation times, are even more susceptible than phytoplankton to flushing loss, therefore phytoplankton are affected not only by abiotic conditions linked to hydrodynamics but also by zooplankton due to weakened grazing pressure. During the Asian Games (November 12-27, 2010 in Guangzhou, China), two intensive epilimnetic withdrawals were conducted in Liuxihe, a deep canyon-shaped reservoir. To examine the influence of the intensive epilimnetic withdrawals on the phytoplankton community, a seven-week field observation and a hydrodynamic simulation were carried out. The observation was divided in two stages: stage 1 represented partial surface vertical mixing period, and stage 2 represented intensive epilimnetic withdrawal period. It was found that phytoplankton abundance and biomass declined with water temperature and partial surface vertical mixing in stage 1. However, the intensive epilimnetic withdrawal reversed this decreasing trend and increased phytoplankton biomass and abundance in stage 2. Phytoplankton showed a higher rate of composition change in stage 2. A numerical model (DYRESM-CAEDYM) simulated scenarios with and without epilimnetic withdrawal to test their effects on abiotic factors (water temperature, suspended sediment and soluble reactive phosphorus) for phytoplankton. The results showed no obvious difference in the abiotic factors between the two scenarios during stage 2. We therefore suggested that the abiotic factors in the water column were probably driven by a seasonal pattern, not by epilimnetic withdrawal. It is likely that the intensive epilimnetic withdrawal could remove large crustaceans. The reduced grazing pressure probably explained the increase of phytoplankton biomass and abundance after the withdrawal. Thus, we suggest that reservoir operation should pay more attention to grazing from large crustaceans. It is recommended that, in the management of reservoirs, intensive epilimnetic withdrawal during autumn should be avoided in order to control excessive phytoplankton in the tropics and subtropics.

Distribution of pelagic invertebrates near a thermal bar in Lake Baikal	HYDROBIOLOGIA					3rd Symposium on Species in Ancient Lakes	SEP 02-07, 2002	Quincy, WA					In Lake Baikal, frontal zones are a factor forming the pelagic structure, including area limits of pelagic communities. The spacial distribution of Baikal micro-organisms and diatom algae is known to be influenced by the vertical circulation of Lake Baikal deep waters during the spring thermal bar. In June 2001, we studied the distribution of plankton invertebrates and ways in which it depends on physico-chemical and biological parameters of water in the vicinity of spring thermal bars. Samples were taken through June 11-13th along three transects, across the middle basin of Lake Baikal and the Selenga shallow waters, namely at the Boldakovo River, Cape Sukhinskiy and the Kukuy branches of the Selenga River. As a consequence of the lake possibly being warmed later than usual, and compare with a previous study in 1993, the upper layers with temperatures close to 4 degrees C, were located near the shore where water depth was 14-100 m, from north to south. The littoral waters, warmed above 4 degrees C and reaching 12.7 degrees C near Cape Sukhinskiy, are known to differ from the open lake in hydrochemical indexes, raised number of bacterioplankton and the structure of algae coenoses (in particular, the presence of algae which indicate the spread of the Selenga River waters). An unusual vertical distribution of autotrophic picoplankton in terms of raised concentrations at the bottom, 60 m deep, occurred at the Cape Sukhinskiy transect within a thermal bar zone. This indicated the descent of upper waters rich in picoplankton. The zooplankton structure in the littoral also differed from that in more open waters where temperatures were below 4 degrees C, mainly by its richer diversity increased by littoral inhabitants. The pelagic amphipod Macrohectopus branickii preferred cold waters less than 4 degrees C. Crustaceans and rotifers were separated into different groups according to spacial distribution.					; Ivanov, Vyacheslav/AAY-5196-2021; Belykh, Olga/J-3406-2018; Belykh, Olga/L-6880-2019; Bondarenko, Nina/J-3326-2018	Ivanov, Vyacheslav/0000-0002-6524-1169; Kostornova, Tatyana/0000-0001-7625-5980; Belykh, Olga/0000-0002-1188-7351; 													0018-8158					SEP 15	2006	568			1			69	76		10.1007/s10750-006-0331-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0331-9													WOS:000240688900012

Here, we propose the Titan's Hydrocarbons: Uncovering New Dimensions of Evolutionary pRocesses (THUNDER) mission concept to investigate how Titan's surface reflects the nature of its interior and its active hydrocarbon cycle. This mission will change our understanding of Titan's surface through three science objectives: characterizing the heat and material transport properties of Titan's icy outer layer, tracing surface liquid storage through and across the crust, and assessing the total hydrocarbon budget through time. This New Frontiers-class mission, designed as part of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Planetary Science Summer School, responds directly to the call for a Titan orbiter in the NASA Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey 2023-2032. THUNDER's focused geology and geophysics mission could achieve full surface mapping to complement both the Cassini-Huygens and Dragonfly missions using gravity science, radar with three operational modes, and a visible-to-infrared spectrometer. These instruments together could give us the first look at Titan as a fully connected and geologically active world, revolutionizing our understanding of icy bodies, fluvial and atmospheric processes, and habitability across geologic time. Here, we summarize the goals of the science mission and engineering approaches, as well as challenges and future directions to study before THUNDER can become a viable mission concept.					; Scully, Jennifer/L-5092-2019; Keane, James/AAI-5137-2020	Seltzer, Cassandra/0000-0002-7894-2159; Radzom, Brandon/0000-0002-0015-382X; Hill, Jonathon/0000-0002-9570-1429; Burtt, David/0009-0003-4461-0396; Brouwer, Gwendolyn/0009-0001-0013-9147; 														2632-3338				FEB 1	2025	6	2							45	10.3847/PSJ/ad973e	http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/PSJ/ad973e													WOS:001424655600001

Post-supereruption recovery at Toba Caldera	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Large calderas, or supervolcanoes, are sites of the most catastrophic and hazardous events on Earth, yet the temporal details of post-supereruption activity, or resurgence, remain largely unknown, limiting our ability to understand how supervolcanoes work and address their hazards. Toba Caldera, Indonesia, caused the greatest volcanic catastrophe of the last 100 kyr, climactically erupting similar to 74 ka. Since the supereruption, Toba has been in a state of resurgence but its magmatic and uplift history has remained unclear. Here we reveal that new C-14, zircon U-Th crystallization and (U-Th)/He ages show resurgence commenced at 69.7+/-4.5 ka and continued until at least similar to 2.7 ka, progressing westward across the caldera, as reflected by post-caldera effusive lava eruptions and uplifted lake sediment. The major stratovolcano north of Toba, Sinabung, shows strong geochemical kinship with Toba, and zircons from recent eruption products suggest Toba's climactic magma reservoir extends beneath Sinabung and is being tapped during eruptions.					; Schmitt, Axel/A-1279-2010; Danisik, Martin/GQY-6103-2022; de Silva, Shanaka/A-4630-2011	Coble, Matthew/0000-0002-7536-0559; Danisik, Martin/0000-0002-0885-4938; Schmitt, Axel/0000-0002-9029-4211; de Silva, Shanaka/0000-0002-0310-5516														2041-1723				MAY 16	2017	8								15248	10.1038/ncomms15248	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15248								28508876					WOS:000401404600001

In Vestfjella, proglacial surface lakes and ponds are characterized by a 2-5 month long period with liquid water and depths < 2 m. We give a detailed description of nine seasonal lakes and ponds situating at three nunataqs (Basen, Plogen and Fossilryggen) in western Dronning Maud Land. Their physical and geochemical properties are provided based on observations in four summers. Three main 'lake categories' were found: 1) supraglacial lakes, 2) epiglacial ponds and 3) nunataq ponds. Category 3 lakes can be divided into two subgroups with regards to whether the meltwater source is glacial or just seasonal snow patches. Supraglacial lakes are ultra-oligotrophic (electrical conductivity < 10 mu S cm(-1), pH < 7), while in epiglacial ponds the concentrations of dissolved and suspended matter and trophic status vary over a wide range (electrical conductivity 20-110 mu S cm(-1), pH 6-9). In nunataq ponds, the maxima were an electrical conductivity of 1042 mu S cm(-1)and a pH of 10.1, and water temperature may have wide diurnal and day-to-day fluctuations (maximum 9.3 degrees C) because snowfall, snow drift and sublimation influence the net solar irradiance.

Quantifying seasonal succession of phytoplankton trait-environment associations in human-altered landscapes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Integration of species traits in direct gradient analysis generates insights into how communities are assembled and may respond to environmental changes. We investigated phytoplankton trait-environment relationships for over 300 taxa during the open-water season across 75 north-temperate lakes and reservoirs in Alberta, Canada. An innovative, data-driven approach was applied using iterative model selection for RLQ optimization to reveal key monthly associations. Fourth-corner analysis then tested the significance of relationships using spatially and phylogenetically constrained null models derived by Moran spectral randomization. Both local- and regional-scale drivers of succession were found with evidence of deterministic filtering by traits increasing in mid-summer. Trait associations to land-use and water quality highlighted potential anthropogenic cross-scale interactions, such as logging and pasture development affecting phytoplankton via allochthonous nutrient inputs. Biogeographic factors (e.g., elevation and habitat size) and associated temperature and chemical gradients (e.g., pH and bicarbonate) were also linked to multiple morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits, including potential toxin production. Several correlated traits emphasized importance of trait syndromes corresponding to distinct taxonomic groups (e.g., cyanobacteria and green algae). However, rather than clustering species with shared ecological preferences or roles, our study builds on past trait-based approaches to phytoplankton by testing for explicit trait associations with a range of environmental factors. Thus, we provide a novel, quantitative means of revealing environmental constraints on communities and translating their compositional changes under climate and other human influences into functional impacts on freshwater ecosystems.

J	Ejsmont-Karabin, J; Karpowicz, M				Ejsmont-Karabin, Jolanta; Karpowicz, Maciej			Rotifera in lake subhabitats	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Lake ecosystems contain numerous habitats, such as the relatively homogeneous pelagial, as well as many different subhabitats in the littoral zone. Among rotifer communities inhabiting the littoral zone are those living in organic sediments (epipelon), on submerged stones (epilithon), among sand grains (hydropsammon), on animals (epizoon), on submerged branches and twigs (epixylon) and on macrophytes (epiphyton). The aim of this work was to explain differences in species richness among rotifer communities inhabiting these subhabitats. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the structure and diversity of rotifer species were based on studies carried out in the summers of 2009-2020 in lakes in northeastern Poland. The analysis of the structure and density of rotifer species inhabiting different lake subhabitats suggests that although the communities are subject to similar ecological characteristics, there are marked differences in the species richness and diversity of the communities. A characteristic feature is the presence of species sharing subhabitats and species assigned to only one habitat type.																			1386-2588	1573-5125				DEC	2021	55	4			SI		1285	1296		10.1007/s10452-020-09818-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-020-09818-1		JAN 2021											WOS:000604461800001

So far, little is known about their distribution in peat-bog lakes. Seventeen peat-bog lakes were sampled during three summer seasons 2009, 2011, and 2012, and the vertical distribution of AAPs was determined by infrared epifluorescence microscopy. The analysis demonstrated that in the surface layers of the studied lakes, AAP abundance ranged from 0.3 to 12.04 x 10(5) cells mL(-1), which represents < 1 to 18.3 % of the total bacteria. The vertical distribution of AAPs confirmed their presence in the upper parts of the water column with minimum numbers in the anoxic bottom waters. We have shown that the AAP abundance was significantly positively correlated with the water pH, and the highest proportion of photoheterotrophs was found in peat-bog lakes with a pH between 6.7 and 7.6. Our results demonstrated an influence of water acidity on the abundance of AAPs, which may reflect a fundamental difference in the microbial composition between acidic and pH neutral peat-bog lakes.

Here, we examined the changes in precipitation, temperature and climate extremes (23 indices) in the Teesta River basin in Eastern Himalayas for the period 1951-2100. We used four different General Circulation Models (GCMs) with two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). We found substantial changes in precipitation, temperature and climate extreme patterns for both observed and projected climates. In general, warming and increase in precipitation were found, which increases from RCP4.5 to RCP8.5. The basin-average maximum and minimum daily temperatures are expected to increase by 0.54 degrees C, 1.18 degrees C and 1.92 degrees C, and 0.5 degrees C, 1.2 degrees C and 2 degrees C for period 2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100, respectively, compared to 1951-2010 period under RCP8.5. Precipitation is likely to increase in both monsoon and non-monsoon seasons; however, there is large uncertainty associated with projections. Significant increase in precipitation indices, such as RX1day, RX5day, R10, R20, CWD and R95p, is projected under RCPs over the 21st century. Decrease in cool events, such as cool nights, cool days, frost days and ice days, and increase in warm events, such as warm nights, warm days, summer days and tropical nights, are projected under RCPs. In addition, the snowfall contribution to precipitation is likely to decrease drastically, which might result in water availability issues. Our results are in agreement with previous studies in and around the basin.					; Sharma, Ashutosh/AAM-3049-2020	Goyal, Manish Kumar/0000-0001-9777-6128; Sharma, Ashutosh/0000-0003-2613-2821; 													0169-8095	1873-2895				JAN 1	2020	231								104670	10.1016/j.atmosres.2019.104670	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2019.104670													WOS:000513178000014

Numerical modeling of seawater intrusion into endorheic hydrological systems	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Several groundwater endorheic base levels are known in different parts of the world. Some of them allow seawater encroachment into them. Two examples of such groundwater systems, at Lake Asal in the Afar Depression of East Africa and Lago Enriquillo in the Dominican Republic, have been modeled using FEFLOW. The simulated flow pattern reproduces the seawater encroachment all the way from the sea to the endorheic base level. When the water in that base level undergoes concentration to brine through evaporation, the dense brine starts to flow below the encroaching seawater body in the opposite direction toward the sea. These processes reach steady-state conditions in a relatively short time of several hundred years.

The area of the lake is about 22 km2 and the volume about 767 Mm3. The water level drops by as much as 16 m in winter. Sainte-Croix is a warm monomictic oligotrophic lake. The indigenous fish fauna of the Verdon originally included 8 species. Successive stocking has raised this number to 17. In catches made in 1976-1977 with 27 mm mesh nets, 80 to 90% of the fish with a body size of between 15 and 25 cm were of the four main species indigenous to the river before the dam was built: Leuciscus cephalus, Barbus fluviatilis, Chondrostoma toxostoma, Salmo trutta. Catches made at same period with 14 mm mesh nets gave only Chondrostoma toxostoma and Leuciscus cephalus. Changes in the fish fauna were apparent from catches made in 1984 and 1987 with nets of the same mesh size. There was a marked demographic increase of roach, and more recently of bleak and gudgeon, all three species introduced after the construction of the dam. At the same time, there was a decrease in catch frequency of Ch. toxostoma, L. cephalus and B. fluviatilis in the downstream area of the lake. Stomach content analysis carried out in different seasons on the six most abundant species of the lake (roach, toxostome, chub, bleak, perch and gudgeon) provided evidence on the trophic organisation of the fish fauna. We have measured niche breadth for each species by the Simpson diversity index and niche overlap by the Pianka index. Bleak is the only species to feed on zooplankton in open water. Roach is a particularly opportunistic feeder, sometimes taking plankton, but at Sainte-Croix it is exclusively herbivorous and benthophagous. Niche overlap between these two species is slight or null, depending on the season. On the other hand, there is a high degree of overlap between roach and chub and between roach and toxostome. The decrease in toxostome and chub frequency in the downstream area of the lake, where roach is most abundant, would appear to be a competitive exclusion phenomenon. There is high niche overlap between bleak and young perch, which partly explains the low abundance of the latter species; other contributory factors are the scarcity of zooplankton inshore, and the scarcity of zoobenthos resulting from the drop in the water level in winter.																			0018-8158					NOV 22	1990	207						197	207		10.1007/BF00041457	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00041457													WOS:A1990EW45800024
J	DANELL, K				DANELL, K			FOOD-HABITS OF MUSKRAT, ONDATRA-ZIBETHICA (L), IN A SWEDISH LAKE	ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI												The food habits of the muskrat were studied in a north-Swedish lake from May-Nov. by microscopic analysis of fecal pellets. Remains of Equisetum were found in all pellets during the whole period. Carex spp. were constantly present from May to early July, thereafter only sporadically. Schoenoplectus was found in significantly more pellets between late July and early Oct. than either from May to early July or in Nov. Other plant species were revorded only occasionally, and no remains of animal food were found in any pellets. After the thaw the Schoenoplectus belt can only be utilized with difficulty, because of the high water-level during the spring flood and the problems connected with constructing feeding platforms before the Schoenoplectus culms emerge above the water surface. The importance of absolute water-level in the utilization of Schoenoplectus by muskrats was confirmed by comparison of the observations made in years with above- and below-normal lake water-levels. The muskrat feeds in the immediate vicinity of its lodge and the seasonal changes in food habits correspond to the seasonal shift in habitat preference for lodge sites.																			0003-455X	1797-2450					1978	15	3					177	181																WOS:A1978FV02100001

W.; Helle, Gerd; Pons, Thijs L.; Guyot, Jean-Loup; Gloor, Manuel			Oxygen isotopes in tree rings are a good proxy for Amazon precipitation and El Nino-Southern Oscillation variability	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												We present a unique proxy for the reconstruction of variation in precipitation over the Amazon: oxygen isotope ratios in annual rings in tropical cedar (Cedrela odorata). A century-long record from northern Bolivia shows that tree rings preserve the signal of oxygen isotopes in precipitation during the wet season, with weaker influences of temperature and vapor pressure. Tree ring delta O-18 correlates strongly with delta(18)Oin precipitation from distant stations in the center and west of the basin, and with Andean ice core delta O-18 showing that the signal is coherent over large areas. The signal correlates most strongly with basin-wide precipitation and Amazon river discharge. We attribute the strength of this (negative) correlation mainly to the cumulative rainout processes of oxygen isotopes (Rayleigh distillation) in air parcels during westward transport across the basin. We further find a clear signature of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the record, with strong ENSO influences over recent decades, but weaker influence from 1925 to 1975 indicating decadal scale variation in the controls on the hydrological cycle. The record exhibits a significant increase in delta O-18 over the 20th century consistent with increases in Andean delta O-18 ice core and lake records, which we tentatively attribute to increased water vapor transport into the basin. Taking these data together, our record reveals a fresh path to diagnose and improve our understanding of variation and trends of the hydrological cycle of the world's largest river catchment.

The aim of this study was to investigate the total methane (CH4) mass balance of Lake Willersinnweiher with a particular focus on the interaction of carbon and sulfur cycling within the lake sediments and the redoxcline of the water column. Our results show that Lake Willersinnweiher permanently releases CH4 to the atmosphere throughout the whole year 2018 at rates ranging from 5 to 120 mol d(-1). Sediment data show the presence of intense anaerobic oxidation of CH4 in the upper sediment layers during early summer. Here, CH4 is most likely consumed via sulfate in sulfate-methane transition zones (SMTZs) that have been observed for a few specific freshwater environments only. Seasonal dynamics in biogeochemical processes trigger the non-steady state conditions within the sediments and the CH4 consumption in the SMTZs. In parallel, CH4 released from the sediments is completely consumed by aerobic oxidation processes in the redoxcline indicated by minimum CH4 concentrations with high delta C-13-CH4 values. This zone acts as an effective barrier, minimizing CH4 release into the surface water and the atmosphere and thus CH4 oversaturation along with near-atmospheric isotopic composition indicate the presence of an additional CH4 source in the epilimnion of Lake Willersinnweiher.

Here, we analyze the morphology and depositional and sequence architecture of a small-scale valley to deltaic complex preserved in a late Pliocene intermontane coalfield in the Northern Apennines, Italy. Outcrop exposures are integrated with 160+ well logs in an area of less than 1.5 km(2). The main goal of this study is to demonstrate that spatially restricted yet fully preserved nonmarine systems are well suited for depositional, sequence, and modern analogue modelling, and deserve more attention in the literature. In this study, outcrop and borehole data are merged into isopach maps, highlighting the sedimentary response to a discrete cycle of lake-level retreat and re-expansion. Falling-stage and lowstand phases were characterized by incision of a meandering valley onto a previous highstand shelf, and by the avulsive progradation of an attached, shelf-edge delta. The supply-dominated character of the depositional system along with the limited wave fetch favored in this phase the preservation of the maximum regressive surface across the entire incised-valley to deltaic transect. The following lake-level re-expansion involved estuarine valley back-filling, and the transition from river-dominated to wave-dominated deltaic deposition. Enhanced wave ravinement and associated shoreline-independent prodelta forestepping promoted the development of a transgressive shelf-break bypass. These results are compared with reference sequence and accommodation models, as well as with two modern Ethiopian lakes undergoing acute forced regression. The similar scale and morphology of modern stranded highstand shelves and shelf-edge deltas provide a parallel for assessing the original topographic gradients and depositional dynamics of the late Pliocene case study. Modern and ancient analogues also shed light on the amplification of climate records in endorheic lakes, on the potentially strong avulsive character of falling-stage deltas, and on the sedimentary response to short-lived lacustrine fluctuations in rapidly subsiding basins.

The following six species were recorded: Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) fulvidraconis Li, 1935, Camallanus cotti Fujita, 1927, Dentiphilometra monopteri Moravec et Wang, 2002, Pingus sinensis Hsu, 1933, Proleptinae gen. sp. larv., and Eustrongylides sp. larv. Data on their morphology, morphological variability, host range, prevalence, intensity and distribution are provided. SEM studies of P. fulvidraconis and larval Physalopterinae, used for the first time in these species, revealed some additional morphological details and made it possible to redescribe the former. In contrast to the existing description of P. fulvidraconis, this species was found to possess two spicules and a V-shaped gubernaculum with unequal arms (originally mistaken for the left spicule), as well as deirids, whose location can be considered an important taxonomic feature. Larvae of the Physalopterinae have not previously been reported from fishes in China. The finding of larval Eustrongylides in Paramisgurnus dabryanus represents a new host record. All but one nematode species from this zoogeographically interesting region are briefly described and illustrated.

J	León, JG; Pedrozo, FL; Temporetti, PF				Gabriel Leon, Jose; Luis Pedrozo, Fernando; Felix Temporetti, Pedro			Phosphorus fractions and sorption dynamics in the sediments of two Ca-SO4 water reservoirs in the central Argentine Andes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH												Phosphorus (P) fractionation and sorption behavior were studied in the sediments of two calcium-sulfate (Ca-SO4: Ca2+ 170 mg L-1; SO42- 400 mg L-1) water reservoirs in the southern central Argentine Andes - El Carrizal Reservoir (ECR), which stratifies in summer and El Nihuil Reservoir (ENR), which is vertically mixed throughout the year. Sediment size classes reflected the lithology of both basins and the reservoirs relative location: ECR (downstream from a valley adjacent to a mountain environment) had higher clay proportions while the sand fraction was more important in ENR (just next to a mountain environment). In both reservoirs, the chemical composition revealed low alteration and calcium enrichment. Total P content was relatively high (1.1 - 1.6 mg P kg(-1) dry weight) as expected from the contribution of marine formations. P fractionation was dominated by Ca-P (ECR, 69% and ENR, 63%) followed by organic-P (23%) in summer-anoxic ECR and by iron/aluminum (Fe/Al)-P (27%) in oxic ENR. Batch experiments showed that sorption behavior in ECR had a typical Langmuir isotherm plot while in ENR that model fitted only at low dissolved P values (< 5 mg P L-1) and co-precipitation evidence was observed at higher P concentrations. It is proposed that lower Fe/Al-P content in anoxic (ECR) vs. oxic (ENR) sediments results from the P released from iron-bound phosphorus due to sulfate reduction-ferrous sulfide formation in an anoxic environment. This condition should enable ECR sediments to adsorb P into fresh oxidized iron, and ENR sediments to co-precipitate P with calcium due to Fe/Al-P saturation, as observed in batch experiments. This paper constitutes the first description of phosphorus content and dynamics in reservoir sediments in arid central western Argentina, where water sulfate concentrations are naturally high due to basin lithology.

A model based on stepwise multiple regression analysis suggests that lakes most prone to high rates of internal phosphorus loading will be alkaline with high concentrations of spring overturn total phosphorus, and with sediments characterized by high concentrations of iron-bound phosphorus, and low concentrations of organic matter.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAR	1989	46	3					416	419		10.1139/f89-055	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f89-055													WOS:A1989T558000007
J	Wan, RR; Dai, X; Shankman, D				Wan, Rongrong; Dai, Xue; Shankman, David			Vegetation Response to Hydrological Changes in Poyang Lake, China	WETLANDS												Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake and area of alluvial wetlands in China. The vast, seasonally-inundated alluvial plain is internationally recognized for its rare and endangered species which was one of the first to be included in The Ramsar Convention's List of Wetlands of International Importance. Average lake stage (water level) has declined during both the summer wet season and dryer part of the year since the early 2000s, resulting in significant hydrological and ecological consequences. The purpose of this study is to describe changing spatial patterns for major vegetation types and relate vegetation response to changing hydrological conditions. The results suggest that vegetation patterns have shifted substantially in recent years. Most significant is spread of reed and sedge dominated plant communities to sites 1 m to 2 m lower in elevation. Reed communities that continue to dominate the highest elevations within the lake basin expanded across shallow regions of the lake previously too wet for regeneration. In contrast, sedges cannot tolerate dry conditions, and therefore, declined on higher sites. The dominance of aquatic plant communities doubled in area at low elevation sites in the absence of the severe floods that normally inhibit regeneration. We attributed the variation of vegetation patterns to the great water regime changes. However, lower lake stage has not resulted in a highly-degraded wetland ecosystem. Plant communities will continue to adjust to future long-term changes in lake hydrological conditions. The findings provide an important baseline in monitoring vegetation communities' shifts in Poyang Lake wetland from which future research can be compared but also for other international tropical wetlands also impacted by similar threats.					dai, xue/KFB-3128-2024	Wan, Rongrong/0000-0002-4705-8846													0277-5212	1943-6246				DEC	2019	39			1			S99	S112		10.1007/s13157-018-1046-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-018-1046-1													WOS:000533992000010

Large numbers of lake whitefish migrated into the river in fall where they spawned on expansive limestone bedrock and gravel bars. Lake whitefish were harvested in the river during this time by commercial fisheries and for fish culture operations. The last reported landing of lake whitefish from the Detroit River was in 1925. Loss of suitable spawning habitat during the construction of the shipping channels as well cis the effects of over-fishing, sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) predation, loss of riparian wetlands, and other perturbations to riverine habitat are associated with the disappearance of lake whitefish spawning runs. Because lake whitefish are recovering in Lake Erie with substantial spawning occurring in the western basin, we suspected they may once again be using the Detroit River to spawn. We sampled in the Detroit River for lake whitefish adults and eggs in late fall of 2005 and for lake whitefish eggs and fish larvae in 2006 to assess the extent of reproduction in the river. A spawning-ready male lake whitefish was collected in gillnets and several dozen viable lake whitefish eggs were collected with a pump in the Detroit River in November and December 2005. No lake whitefish eggs were found at lower river sites in March of 2006, but viable lake whitefish eggs were found at Belle Isle in the upper river in early April. Several hundred lake whitefish larvae were collected in the river during March through early May 2006. Peak larval densities (30 fish/1,000 m(3) of water) were observed during the week of 3 April. Because high numbers of lake whitefish larvae were collected from mid- and downstream sample sites in the river, we believe that production of lake whitefish in the Detroit River may be a substantial contribution to the lake whitefish population in Lake Erie.

It connects to the Negro river by a channel, so its level varies according to the floods of the river. The water has low pH (< 5), low conductivity (< 7.60 mu S.cm(-1)) and high temperature (> 28.5 degrees C). During a taxonomic study of the genus Pinnularia, four new species are described: P. manausensis Pereira & Torgan, P. nelsonii Pereira & Torgan, P. tupensis Pereira, Melo & Torgan and P. walkerae Pereira & Torgan. The study was based on samples taken during October and December 2003 (low waters) and September 2008 (falling), including samples of plankton and sediment.

V.			Postbreeding ecology of wood ducks in the Illinois River Valley	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The wood duck (Aix sponsa) consistently ranks within the top 5 harvested duck species for both Illinois and the Mississippi Flyway. While substantial research has been done on wood ducks, especially their breeding ecology, few studies have investigated the postbreeding ecology of the species. We captured and marked wood ducks with either a very high frequency (VHF) radio transmitter or a solar-charged global system of mobile communication (GSM) transmitter during the postbreeding period from August through September 2018-2020. Capture locations were within the La Grange Pool of the Illinois River extending from near Pekin, Illinois to the La Grange Lock and Dam near Meredosia, Illinois, USA. We used conventional radio-telemetry techniques to track wood ducks to determine cover type use, home range size, daily movement patterns, survival, and migration chronology. Home range size (95% minimum convex polygon) for wood ducks averaged 6,820 +/- 572 ha (SE) and we did not find evidence for a difference by age, sex, or transmitter type. Daily movement distance in August (2,031 +/- 51 m) was similar to daily movement distance in September (1,922 +/- 44 m), but daily movement distances for August and September were less than daily movement distance for October (3,509 +/- 53 m) and November (3,347 +/- 106 m). Wood ducks primarily used wetlands with woody (45.0%) and emergent vegetation (40.4%), and the most commonly used wetland types by wood ducks were impounded wetlands (53.8%), lakes (17.6%), and ponds (10.7%). Model-derived survival during the postbreeding period was 0.79 (95% CI = 0.74-0.84). Daily survival was positively related to increased river level and had a mean increase of 4.06 +/- 0.67% for every 0.3-m increase in the Illinois River level at low river levels (1.5-3.0 m) and a mean increase of 1.38 +/- 0.32% for every 0.3-m increase in the Illinois River level at high river levels (4.0-5.5 m). Average departure date of wood ducks leaving the Illinois River Valley was 27 October (range =13 August-15 December), and adult male wood ducks left the study area 11-16 days earlier than the other age and sex cohorts (H2 = 11.6, P = 0.01). Providing additional waterfowl sanctuaries that contain wooded wetlands, especially in years of low river levels, may increase survival for wood ducks during the postbreeding period.

JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Historically, Cisco Coregonus artedi and deepwater ciscoes Coregonus spp. were the most abundant and ecologically important fish species in the Laurentian Great Lakes, but anthropogenic influences caused nearly all populations to collapse by the 1970s. Fishery managers have begun exploring the feasibility of restoring populations throughout the basin, but questions regarding hatchery propagation and stocking remain. We used historical and contemporary stock-recruit parameters previously estimated for Ciscoes in Wisconsin waters of Lake Superior, with estimates of age-1 Cisco rearing habitat (broadly defined as total hectares <= 80 m depth) and natural mortality, to estimate how many fry (5.5 mo posthatch), fall fingerling (7.5 mo posthatch), and age-1 (at least 12 mo posthatch) hatchery-reared Ciscoes are needed for stocking in the Great Lakes to mimic recruitment rates in Lake Superior, a lake that has undergone some recovery. Estimated stocking densities suggested that basin-wide stocking would require at least 6.41 x 10(8) fry, 4.69 x 10(8) fall fingerlings, or 3.43 x 10(8) age-1 fish for a simultaneous restoration effort targeting historically important Cisco spawning and rearing areas in Lakes Huron, Michigan, Erie, Ontario, and Saint Clair. Numbers required for basin-wide stocking were considerably greater than current or planned coregonine production capacity, thus simultaneous stocking in the Great Lakes is likely not feasible. Provided current habitat conditions do not preclude Cisco restoration, managers could maximize the effectiveness of available production capacity by concentrating stocking efforts in historically important spawning and rearing areas, similar to the current stocking effort in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron. Other historically important Cisco spawning and rearing areas within each lake (listed in no particular order) include 1) Thunder Bay in Lake Huron, 2) Green Bay in Lake Michigan, 3) the islands near Sandusky, Ohio, in western Lake Erie, and 4) the area near Hamilton, Ontario, and Bay of Quinte in Lake Ontario. Our study focused entirely on Ciscoes but may provide a framework for describing future stocking needs for deepwater ciscoes.

The fluvial lakes of the central Amazon area received 2371 mm of rain during the study year. Temperatures were 30 .+-. 4.degree. C. Thermal stratification was both diurnal and seasonal, occurring during daylight hours at low water periods. Dissolved O2 was most often of a clinograde nature in these shallow lakes, and P and nitrates were low. The ratio of the daily primary production to biomass of phytoplankton was 12.8 in one of the lakes. Bacterial densities ranged from 2.8 .times. 107 to 1.7 .times. 109/l. Vmax ranged from 0.045 to 9.644 .mu.g glucose/l .cntdot. h, and turnovers times ranged from a low of 12 to a high of 36,000 h. The intimate relationship the lakes have with the rivers in the annual rise and fall is seen as the major controlling mechanism for the limnological events occurring in the lakes of the central Amazon.																			0003-9136						1982	96	1					97	111																WOS:A1982PX13600006

J	McCarty, JP				McCarty, JP			Aquatic community characteristics influence the foraging patterns of tree swallows	CONDOR												During periods of inclement spring weather, Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) were observed foraging close to the surface of a series of experimentally manipulated ponds. Censuses of for aging swallows during these periods indicated that the use of ponds for foraging was positively affected by earlier additions of nutrients and the removal of fish from the ponds. Collections of emerging insects from these ponds indicated that nutrient additions and the removal of fish greatly increased the numbers of insects emerging from those ponds. The ability of Tree Swallows to exploit local concentrations of food may be critical to their ability to return to the breeding grounds before aerial insects are reliably available.

Microcystis genotype succession in relation to microcystin concentrations in freshwater lakes	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Potentially toxic Cyanobacteria, like Microcystis, form a serious threat in recreational waters and drinking-water reservoirs. We monitored the population dynamics of toxic and non-toxic Microcystis strains using rRNA of the internal transcribed spacer region in combination with DGGE to determine whether there is a seasonal succession of toxic and non-toxic Microcystis genotypes in freshwater lakes and, if so, whether this succession can explain seasonal dynamics of the toxin microcystin. We studied 3 lakes in The Netherlands, all dominated by Microcystis during summer. Coexistence of several genotypes was observed in all lakes. The seasonal succession in a deep, stratified lake started with a population consisting of several toxic genotypes at the onset of the bloom, which changed into a population dominated by non-toxic genotypes at the end of the bloom. In this lake, the genotype succession clearly accounted for the observed microcystin dynamics. In 2 unstratified lakes, we also observed a seasonal replacement of Microcystis genotypes; however, the relation between genotype succession and microcystin dynamics was less conspicuous, since toxic strains dominated throughout the bloom period. A seasonal succession of different Microcystis genotypes might often be a key mechanism determining microcystin concentrations in Microcystisdominated lakes. Therefore, factors driving the succession of toxic and non-toxic genotypes deserve further study.					; Visser, Petra/NJT-4667-2025; Huisman, Jef/A-1089-2013	Visser, Petra/0000-0003-3294-1908; Huisman, Jef/0000-0001-9598-3211													0948-3055	1616-1564				JUN 20	2007	48	1					1	12		10.3354/ame048001	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame048001													WOS:000248017500001

Impact of Climate Change on the Glaciers of Spiti River Basin, Himachal Pradesh, India	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												People living in Spiti river basin, located in the north-eastern part of Himachal Pradesh, depend heavily on seasonal snow and glacier melt for their water requirements. The basin is more susceptible to climate change, as it indicates a higher rise in temperature than other parts of Himachal Pradesh. This work assesses glaciers' current health and projects future changes under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 (Representative Concentration Pathway) climate change scenarios. The total glaciated area in Spiti basin is 550.5 sq. km containing 21.42 +/- 3.86 Giga-tonnes (Gt) of stored water. The basin has observed a mass loss of 8.89 Gt from 1985 to 2013. The future projection for the worst-case scenario (RCP8.5) suggests, 4.1 degrees C rise in temperature and 3.4% increase in winter precipitation by 2070 (average, 2065-2075), from 1985 to 2005 baseline period. Under this climate change scenario, the Spiti basin is likely to experience 84.8% loss in glacier stored water, 71.8% reduction in glaciated area from observed values of 2014. Besides, 76% of total glaciers may disappear by 2070 under RCP 8.5 scenario, which will alter the village communities' water security status, thereby highlighting the urgency to develop an adaptation strategy for the region.

Diurnal cycle of lake methane flux	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Air-lake methane flux (FCH4) and partial pressure of methane in the atmosphere (pCH(4a)) were measured using the eddy covariance method over a Swedish lake for an extended period. The measurements show a diurnal cycle in both FCH4 and pCH(4a) with high values during nighttime (FCH4 approximate to 300 nmol m(-2) s(-1), pCH(4a) approximate to 2.5 mu atm) and low values during day (FCH4 approximate to 0 nmol m(-2) s(-1), pCH(4a) approximate to 2.0 mu atm) for a large part of the data set. This diurnal cycle persist in all open water season; however, the magnitude of the diurnal cycle is largest in the spring months. Estimations of buoyancy in the water show that high nighttime fluxes coincide with convective periods. Our interpretation of these results is that the convective mixing enhances the diffusive flux, in analogy to previous studies. We also suggest that the convection may bring methane-rich water from the bottom to the surface and trigger bubble release from the sediment. A diurnal cycle is not observed for all convective occasions, indicating that the presence of convection is not sufficient for enhanced nighttime flux; other factors are also necessary. The observed diurnal cycle of pCH(4a) is explained with the variation of FCH4 and a changing internal boundary layer above the lake. The presence of a diurnal cycle of FCH4 stresses the importance of making long-term continuous flux measurements. A lack of FCH4 measurements during night may significantly bias estimations of total CH4 emissions from lakes to the atmosphere.

But as many aquatic ecosystems, Meric River Basin is known to be exposed to an intensive organic and inorganic pollution by means of agricultural and industrial pressure on the system. The aim of this study was to determine the water and sediment quality of Meric River Basin by using some statistical techniques. For this purpose, water and sediment samples were collected in spring (rainy) season of 2017 from 24 stations selected on the basin. Total of 19 water quality parameters (temperature, dissolved oxygen, % oxygen saturation, pH, EC, TDS, salinity, turbidity, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, phosphate, sulphate, floride, chloride, ORP, COD, BOD and fecal coliform) were investigated in water samples and also total of 9 inorganic pollution parameters (Cd, Pb, As, B, Cu, Zn, Cr, Ni and Se) were investigated in water and sediment samples. Cluster Analysis (CA) and Factor Analysis (FA) were applied to the results in order to evaluate the detected data effectively. According to detected data, pollution levels of the investigated rivers and lakes as follows; Ergene River > Meric River > Tunca River > Lakes of Meric Delta in general. It was also determined that organic contamination levels in water and toxic element levels in sediment of the Meric River Basin have reached to critical levels and the system is under effect of agricultural and industrial pressure.					; Tokatlı, Cem/AAN-3814-2021	tokatli, cem/0000-0003-2080-7920; 													1018-4619	1610-2304					2019	28	5					4131	4140																WOS:000471836900061

J	PETERSON, KM; BILLINGS, WD				PETERSON, KM; BILLINGS, WD			TUNDRA VEGETATIONAL PATTERNS AND SUCCESSION IN RELATION TO MICRO-TOPOGRAPHY NEAR ATKASOOK, ALASKA	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Spatial patterns of plant communities near Atkasook (Meade River) on the Gubik Sands of the Alaskan Arctic Costal Plain reflect microtopographic relief caused by geomorphic processes. Ice-wedge activity, depth of summer thaw, thaw-lake processes, river meandering and wind erosion and deposition of sands are the principal processes concerned. Permafrost, precipitation and stream-cutting transform microtopographic gradients into steep environmental gradients along which vegetation types sort out rather sharply. Due to annual freeze-thaw processes and large seasonal changes in river flow related to ice-melt, environmental gradients change temporally and spatially in a predictable manner. These changes cause a series of environment-community changes (succession) that can be related to soil-moisture gradients and to disturbance. No one successional sequence is characteristic of this area and successional pathways do not converge upon a single vegetational type. Distinct, relatively stable communities, such as tussock tundra or lichen and dwarf evergreen shrub communities, result from different successional sequences in various segments of a microtopographic-moisture gradient. In this arctic region, geomorphic processes and permafrost appear to bestow a long-term cyclic nature to succession.																			0004-0851						1980	12	4					473	482		10.2307/1550495	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1550495													WOS:A1980KZ49300007

The electricity is mainly purchased from the local electric grid with on-site generation from renewables. Deep geothermal energy serves as the base-load heat supplier due to its better economic performance over an electrified heating system based on heat pumps under the current electricity price. Lake source cooling meets most cooling demand due to its high coefficient of performance and low emissions. Conventional chillers handle the peak-load cooling demand on hot summer days. Peak-load heat demand can be met by introducing biomass or biogas heating, heat pumps, hot water tanks, and green hydrogen. A multi-period optimization model given a time horizon and a temporal resolution is built on the basis of the proposed superstructure for carbon-neutral energy systems to minimize the total annualized cost. The model aims to determine the optimal energy systems configuration, seasonal operations, energy mix, and corresponding capacity of technologies while fulfilling the seasonal demand for electricity, heat, and cooling. A set of case studies using the main campus of Cornell University as the living laboratory demonstrate the applicability of the optimization framework. Based on the current electric power mix, scope 1 and 2 emissions are substantially reduced to 8%-17% of the value in 2020. These numbers are further reduced to 1%-2% when the 2035 electric power mix is considered with higher penetration of low-carbon technologies. The results drawn from the Cornell case can be applied to other campuses, towns, cities, and regions with similar climate conditions, especially the temperature by modifying some case-specific dimensions, such as the local availability of renewable energy sources.					; Tian, Xueyu/NQF-9038-2025; You, Fengqi/B-5040-2011	Zhou, Yilun/0009-0001-6107-0374; Tian, Xueyu/0000-0002-9274-2436; You, Fengqi/0000-0001-9609-4299													1364-0321	1879-0690				JUN	2022	161								112383	10.1016/j.rser.2022.112383	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2022.112383		MAR 2022											WOS:000793420900003
J	Amyot, M; Lean, D; Mierle, G				Amyot, M; Lean, D; Mierle, G			Photochemical formation of volatile mercury in high Arctic lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Formation rates of dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM) were measured in three high (74 degrees N) Arctic lakes and one wetland. The rate of formation of DGM was controlled by (1) the intensity of solar radiation, particularly ultraviolet-B (280-320 nm) and ultraviolet-A (320-400 nm) wavebands and (2) the concentration of available photoreducible Hg(II) complexes. Additions of hydrogen peroxide and of fulvic acids did not enhance DGM formation rates in our experiments. This study illustrates that photoreduction of mercury occurs in a wide range of aquatic systems even in the high arctic where radiation levels are lower but continue for the entire day during the summer.

Temperature and precipitation in the southern Central Andes during the last glacial maximum, Heinrich Stadial 1, and the Younger Dryas	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Recent developments in terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) exposure dating and the reinterpretation of TCN boulder ages from moraines have improved our understanding of the glacial chronology in the Central Andes. According to these records, glacial advances throughout the region correlate with insolation-driven changes in the intensity of the South American Summer Monsoon and millennial-scale climate events such as Heinrich Stadials and the Younger Dryas. Quantifying the temperature and precipitation shifts during these events helps to constrain past moisture pathways and associated changes in atmospheric circulation patterns. Yet, particularly in the southern Central Andes, where a wealth of glacigenic landforms attests to formerly cooler and/or wetter conditions, the magnitudes of past temperature and precipitation changes are only loosely constrained at a few sites. Here, we present results from TCN-dated moraines combined with the reconstruction of former glaciers and paleolakes within the eastern sector of the southern Central Andes (24 degrees-27 degrees S) for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1), and the Younger Dryas (YD). We performed Monte-Carlo simulations with 2-dimensional models of ice flow and lake hydrology that are forced by a spatially-distributed surface energy balance model. Our results indicate that temperatures were 3.0-4.2 degrees C, 2.0-3.3 degrees C and 1.3-2.5 degrees C cooler during the LGM, HS1 and YD, respectively, in agreement with previous estimates elsewhere in the Central Andes. We find that temperature changes during the late glacial are compatible with sea-surface temperature anomalies derived from the tropical Atlantic. Precipitation was only 5-27% greater than today, which contrasts with larger anomalies reconstructed for the Bolivian part of the Andean Plateau (Altiplano). We attribute this discrepancy to the southerly position of our study region with respect to the Bolivian High, supporting the hypothesis that this atmospheric pressure system played a prominent role for South American Summer Monsoon dynamics during glacial episodes.

The importance of sediment and submerged aquatic vegetation as potential habitats for persistent strains of enterococci in a subtropical watershed	WATER RESEARCH												Recent evidence of extended survival of fecal indicator bacteria in sediments and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) has raised concerns about using indicator bacteria to reliably detect fecal contamination. We monitored enterococci densities and population structure in water, sediment and SAV simultaneously at sites across a subtropical watershed (Tampa Bay, FL, USA) over one year to determine the extent to which each matrix serves as a potential reservoir of enterococci. SAV harbored significantly higher mean densities of enterococci than sediments, which harbored higher densities than water. Mean enterococci densities were also greater at sites located further upstream in the watershed. The population structure assessed by BOX-PCR genotyping was relatively dissimilar in each sample, although some similarities among samples suggested grouping by location. Strain diversity ranged from very high to negligible, with lowest overall diversity in lake samples taken during the summer. Several strains were highly abundant and cosmopolitan (found across sites, seasons, and matrices) and were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing as the Enterococcus species casseliflavus, faecalis, faecium, hirae, and mundtii. The proportional dominance of certain strains suggests the existence of persistent and possibly naturalized indicator bacteria populations that are not directly related to pollution events.

Cercarial dermatitis in central India: an emerging health problem among tribal communities	ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY												Although cercarial dermatitis is an emerging disease world- wide, cases of such dermatitis may often go undiagnosed, especially in communities that are affected by various skin infections. Between August 2001 and July 2002, 1336 individuals from tribal villages in central India were examined for dermatitis. Skin scrapings were collected and examined for Sarcoptes scabiei and each subject's response to antiscabies treatment was recorded. Freshwater snails were collected from the local ponds used for bathing, and examined for cercariae. The recorded prevalence of dermatitis ranged between 2.1% and 12.5% during the study year, peaking at the end of winter ( February - March) and during the rainy season ( August - October). Snail positivity for cercariae peaked in the rainy season. The prevalence and the severity of dermatitis were both higher in children than in adults. As most recorded cases of dermatitis were associated with a rash that developed soon after bathing in the local pond, all the skin scrapings were negative for itch mites, and the response to antiscabies treatment was poor, most if not all of the dermatitis observed was probably cercarial. Cercarial dermatitis therefore appears to be a significant health problem among the tribal populations of central India.

The increased primary production indicated rapid eutrophication. The filamentous nitrogen fixing cyanobacterium, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii caused very strong water blooms in 1982, 1992 and 1994. Sewage diversion, phosphorus precipitation at the sewage treatment plants and the construction of a reservoir on the main tributary reduced the phosphorus load of the lake by cca. 40 per cent, but it was not enough to arrest water quality deterioration. Eutrophication control of shallow, already hypertrophic waters is difficult, and decisions must be supported by intensive research.																					0-9521673-3-6				1996							381	388																WOS:A1996BH90B00049

Extraction of phosphorus by NaOH and nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) solutions were compared to results from algal bioassays. The fine sediment particles transported into Flathead Lake during spring runoff had the highest availability (i.e. 6% of total phosphorus).

J	Delmelle, P; Bernard, A; Kusakabe, M; Fischer, TP; Takano, B				Delmelle, P; Bernard, A; Kusakabe, M; Fischer, TP; Takano, B			Geochemistry of the magmatic-hydrothermal system of Kawah Ijen volcano, East Java, Indonesia	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Samples from Kawah Ijen crater lake, spring and fumarole discharges were collected between 1990 and 1996 for chemical and isotopic analysis. An extremely low pH (<0.3) lake contains SO4-Cl waters produced during absorption of magmatic volatiles into shallow ground water. The acidic waters dissolve the rock isochemically to produce "immature" solutions. The strong D and O-18 enrichment of the lake is mainly due to enhanced evaporation at elevated temperature, but involvement of a magmatic component with heavy isotopic ratios also modifies the lake D and O-18 content. The large Delta(SO4-S0) (23.8-26.4 parts per thousand) measured in the lake suggest that dissolved SO4 forms during disproportionation of magmatic SO2 in the hydrothermal conduit at temperatures of 250 similar to 280 degrees C. The lake delta(18)O(SO4) and delta(18)O(H2O) values may reflect equilibration during subsurface circulation of the water at temperatures near 150 degrees C. Significant variations in the lake's bulk composition from 1990 to 1996 were not detected. However, we interpret a change in the distribution and concentration of polythionate species in 1996 as a result of increased SO2-rich gas input to the lake system. Thermal springs at Kawah Ijen consist of acidic SO4-Cl waters on the lakeshore and neutral pH HCO3-SO4-Cl-Na waters in Blawan village, 17 km from the crater. The cation contents of these discharges are diluted compared to the crater lake but still do not represent equilibrium with the rock. The SO4/Cl ratios and water and sulfur isotopic compositions support the idea that these springs are mixtures of summit acidic SO4-Cl water and ground water. The lakeshore fumarole discharges (T = 170 similar to 245 degrees C) have both a magmatic and a hydrothermal component and are supersaturated with respect to elemental sulfur. The apparent equilibrium temperature of the gas is similar to 260 degrees C. The proportions of the oxidized, SO2-dominated magmatic Vapor and of the reduced, H2S-dominated hydrothermal vapor in the fumaroles varied between 1979 and 1996. This may be the result of interaction of SO2-bearing magmatic vapors with the summit acidic hydrothermal reservoir. This idea is supported by the lower H2S/SO2 ratio deduced for the gas producing the SO4-Cl reservoir feeding the lake compared with that observed in the subaerial gas discharges. The condensing gas may have equilibrated in a liquid-vapor zone at about 350 degrees C. Elemental sulfur occurs in the crater lake environment as banded sediments exposed on the lakeshore and as a subaqueous molten body on the crater floor. The sediments were precipitated in the past during inorganic oxidation of H2S in the lake water. This process was not continuous, but was interrupted by periods of massive silica (poorly crystallized) precipitation, similar to the present-day lake conditions. We suggest that the factor controlling the type of deposition is related to whether H2S- or silica-rich volcanic discharges enter the lake. This could depend on the efficiency with which the lake water circulates in the hydrothermal cell beneath the crater. Quenched liquid sulfur products show delta(34)S values similar to those found in the banded deposits, suggesting that the subaqueous molten body simply consists of melted sediments previously accumulated at the lake bottom.

Active thermokarst regions contain rich sources of ice-nucleating particles	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Rapid Arctic climate warming, amplified relative to lower-latitude regions, has led to permafrost thaw and associated thermokarst processes. Recent work has shown permafrost is a rich source of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) that can initiate ice formation in supercooled liquid clouds. Since the phase of Arctic clouds strongly affects the surface energy budget, especially over ice-laden surfaces, characterizing INP sources in this region is critical. For the first time, we provide a large-scale survey of potential INP sources in tundra terrain where thermokarst processes are active and relate to INPs in the air. Permafrost, seasonally thawed active layer, ice wedge, vegetation, water, and aerosol samples were collected near Utqia.gvik, Alaska, in late summer and analyzed for their INP contents. Permafrost was confirmed as a rich source of INPs that was enhanced near the coast. Sensitivity to heating revealed differences in INPs from similar sources, such as the permafrost and active layer. Water, vegetation, and ice wedge INPs had the highest heat-labile percentage. The aerosol likely contained a mixture of known and unsurveyed INP types that were inferred as biological. Arctic water bodies were shown to be potential important links of sources to the atmosphere in thermokarst regions. Therefore, a positive relationship found with total organic carbon considering all water bodies gives a mechanism for future parameterization as permafrost continues to thaw and drive regional landscape shifts.					; DeMott, Paul/C-4389-2011; Creamean, Jessie/GPP-1366-2022; Kreidenweis, Sonia/E-5993-2011; Nieto-Caballero, Marina/ABC-8804-2021	Kreidenweis, Sonia/0000-0002-2561-2914; DeMott, Paul/0000-0002-3719-1889; Hill, Thomas/0000-0002-5293-3959; Barry, Kevin/0000-0002-1896-1921; Creamean, Jessie/0000-0003-3819-5600; 													1680-7316	1680-7324				DEC 22	2023	23	24					15783	15793		10.5194/acp-23-15783-2023	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-15783-2023													WOS:001168871800001

During the period 1987-2013 the occurrence of a series of 306 consecutive days of negative air temperatures was identified in relation to atmospheric circulation in the winter seasons, with a duration of 1-53 days. The longest CDD series occurred in 2010, while low air temperatures were particularly frequent in the year 1996 (-600 degrees C.d). The analysis showed that this phenomenon was most identifiable in December. Research made it possible to distinguish two types of circulation, which were conducive to the cumulation of CDD. Using the logistic regression model it was determined that the probability of ice cover occurrence increased most rapidly in the lower course (-70 degrees C.d), while the weakest interdependence was observed along the other sections. On average, a one-degree-day increase of CDD was connected with an increase in the probability of a permanent ice cover appearing of approximately 1.2-5.7%. The results obtained are of particular significance for identifying the thermal and circulatory factors determining the appearance of ice cover on the rivers of the Polish Lowlands.

We use a multi-model ensemble (MME) of regional climate models from the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) together with the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index System (CFFWIS) to understand changes in wildland fire risk through differences between historical simulations and future projections. Our results are relatively homogeneous across the focus region and indicate modest increases in the magnitude of fire weather indices (FWIs) during northern hemisphere summer. The most pronounced changes occur in the date of the initialization of CFFWIS and peak of the wildland fire season, which in the future are trending earlier in the year, and in the significant increases in the length of high-risk episodes, defined by the number of consecutive days with FWIs above the current 95th percentile. Further analyses show that these changes are most closely linked to expected changes in the focus region's temperature and precipitation. These findings relate to the current understanding of particulate matter vis-A -vis wildfires and have implications for human health and local and regional changes in radiative forcings. When considering current fire management strategies which could be challenged by increasing wildland fire risk, fire management agencies could adapt new strategies to improve awareness, prevention, and resilience to mitigate potential impacts to critical infrastructure and population.					; Stoof, Cathelijne/L-4231-2017	Stoof, Cathelijne/0000-0002-0198-9215; 													0177-798X	1434-4483				JAN	2018	131	1-2					625	639		10.1007/s00704-016-1994-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-016-1994-4													WOS:000419885200045

Mastering the diatom community dynamics is crucial for water supply. In this study, diatom composition, spatial distribution and succession were investigated in Datun Reservoir, Donghu Reservoir and Shuangwangcheng Reservoir, which are important drinking water sources in Shandong province, China. Results showed that the three reservoirs could be classified as being between mesotrophic and moderately eutrophic. The diatom community in each of the three reservoirs exhibited no obvious seasonal succession. The diatom communities in the three reservoirs were relatively simple in composition, with Synedra and Cyclotella being the most dominant groups all year round. Synedra had a negative relationship with NO2-N. Cyclotella had a positive association with NO3-N, but was negatively associated with NH4-N and CODMn in the three reservoirs. Through the analysis of diatom and environmental factors, the three reservoirs have the potential of hosting diatom blooms in summer, when the higher temperature combines with reduced water flow.					lu, yuting/IIS-2826-2023														0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2019	26	24					24503	24515		10.1007/s11356-019-05480-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-05480-9								31230246					WOS:000480557400019
J	Rochera, C; Camacho, A				Rochera, Carlos; Camacho, Antonio			Limnology and Aquatic Microbial Ecology of Byers Peninsula: A Main Freshwater Biodiversity Hotspot in Maritime Antarctica	DIVERSITY-BASEL												Here we present a comprehensive review of the diversity revealed by research in limnology and microbial ecology conducted in Byers Peninsula (Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica) during the last two decades. The site constitutes one of the largest ice-free areas within the Antarctic Peninsula region. Since it has a high level of environmental protection, it is less human-impacted compared to other sites within the South Shetland archipelago. The main investigations in Byers Peninsula focused on the physical and chemical limnology of the lakes, ponds, rivers, and wetlands, as well as on the structure of their planktonic and benthic microbial communities, and on the functional ecology of the microbial food webs. Lakes and ponds in Byers range along a productivity gradient that extends from the less productive lakes located upland to the eutrophic coastal lakes. Their planktonic assemblages include viruses, bacteria, a metabolically diverse community of protists (i.e., autotrophs, heterotrophs, and mixotrophs), and a few metazooplankton species. Most of the studies conducted in the site demonstrate the strong influence of the physical environment (i.e., temperature, availability of light, and water) and nutrient availability in structuring these microbial communities. However, top-down biotic processes may occur in summer, when predation by zooplankton can exert a strong influence on the abundance of protists, including flagellates and ciliated protozoa. As a consequence, bacterioplankton could be partly released from the grazing pressure exerted by these protists, and proliferates fueled by external nutrient subsidies from the lake's catchment. As summer temperatures in this region are slightly above the melting point of water, biotic processes, such as those related to the productivity of lakes during ice-free periods, could become even more relevant as warming induced by climate change progresses. The limnological research carried out at the site proves that Byers Peninsula deserves special attention in the framework of the research in extreme environments. Together with nearby sites, such as Signy Island, Byers Peninsula comprises a featuring element of the Maritime Antarctic region that represents a benchmark area relative to the global distribution and diversity of aquatic microorganisms.

Nutrient enrichment experiments, published silica growth rate kinetics and the decline in observed silica concentration to 0.28 .mu.M, suggest that silica is the dominant factor limiting standing crop. A colony size criterion for evaluating silica limitation is inappropriate under conditions of a silica stationary phase.																			0003-9136						1980	90	1					26	38																WOS:A1980KM80500002

Long-Term Measurements of Methane Ebullition From Thaw Ponds	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Arctic regions are experiencing rapid warming, leading to permafrost thaw and formation of numerous water bodies. Although small ponds in particular are considered hot spots for methane (CH4) release, long-term studies of CH4 efflux from these surfaces are rare. We have collected an extensive data set of CH4 ebullition (bubbling) measurements from eight small thaw ponds (<0.001 km(2)) with different physical and hydrological characteristics over four summer seasons, the longest set of observations from thaw ponds to date. The measured fluxes were highly variable with an average of 20.0 mg CH4 . m(-2) . day(-1) (median: 4.1 mg CH4 . m(-2) . day(-1), n = 2,063) which is higher than that of most nearby lakes. The ponds were categorized into four types based on clear and significant differences in bubble flux. We found that the amount of CH4 released as bubbles from ponds was very weakly correlated with environmental variables, like air temperature and atmospheric pressure, and was potentially more related to differences in physical characteristics of the ponds. Using our measured average daily bubble flux plus the available literature, we estimate circumpolar thaw ponds <0.001 km(2) in size to emit between 0.2 and 1.0 Tg of CH4 through ebullition. Our findings exemplify the importance of high-frequency measurements over long study periods in order to adequately capture the variability of these water bodies. Through the expansion of current spatial and temporal monitoring efforts, we can increase our ability to estimate CH4 emissions from permafrost pond ecosystems now and in the future.

Altogether, 70 lakes were surveyed, 49 of which located in three different lake districts of the west and eastern Italian Alps and 21 in the central Austrian Alps (within the uppermost Danube catchment). In addition to the analysis of environmental variables affecting distribution and species structure of the two planktonic compartments, a brief review of the main research lines and hypotheses adopted in the past for the study of phytoplankton and zooplankton in high Alpine lakes is given. The lakes, investigated partly within the European project EMERGE (EVK1-CT-1999-00032) and partly within a regional project in the eastern Alps, comprise a wide range of morphological, chemical and trophic conditions. The phytoplankton communities were found to be diverse and mostly dominated by flagellates (chrysophytes, cryptophytes and dinoflagellates), and only to a lesser extent by non-motile green algae, desmids and centric diatoms. The zooplankton communities were mainly dominated by Alpine cladocerans and copepod species, while rotifers were abundant within one group of Italian lakes (sampled in early summer). The multivariate statistical analyses (CCA) showed that catchment features (i.e. percentage of vegetation cover and geochemical composition) and nitrate concentration are essential drivers for the phytoplankton, whereas for zooplankton also trophic status of the lakes and phytoplankton structure are important. The combined variance analysis of the lake clusters outlined by the multivariate analyses on phytoplankton and zooplankton data, respectively, allowed the identification of four principal lake types (three located on siliceous and one on carbonaceous bedrock), each one characterised by a certain combination of habitat features, which in their turn influence trophic state, and phytoplankton and zooplankton species composition and functionality.

A critical assessment of claims that human footprints in the Lake Otero basin, New Mexico date to the Last Glacial Maximum	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The ancient human footprints in valley-bottom sediments in Tularosa Valley, New Mexico, are fascinating and potentially important because they suggest interactions between Pleistocene megafauna as well as great antiquity. The dating of those footprints is crucial in interpretations of when humans first came to North America from Asia, but the ages have larger uncertainties than has been reported. Some of that uncertainty is related to the possibility of a radiocarbon reservoir in the water in which the dated propagules of Ruppia cirrhosa grew. As a test of that possibility, Ruppia specimens collected in 1947 from nearby Malpais Spring returned a radiocarbon age of ca. 7400 cal yr BP. We think it would be appropriate to devise and implement independent means for dating the footprints, thus lowering the uncertainty in the proposed age of the footprints and leading to a better understanding of when humans first arrived in the Americas.

Risk assessment of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and trace metals in River Nile up-and downstream of a densely populated area	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH												Cairo city is the largest populated area along the whole course of River Nile with a wide range of anthropogenic activities. Efforts to restore fish habitat and recreational use of the river have raised concerns about its water, sediment and biota quality. This study provides a baseline data on the levels of PCBs and trace metals in River Nile along Cairo sector and implements the formulation of monitoring activities of the river's pollution status. Water, sediment and Nile tilapia 9Oreochromis niloticus) samples were collected during summer season, 2013 from two sites, up-and downstream, for detection and determination of 11 PCB congeners (PCBs 28, 44, 52, 70, 101, 105, 118, 138, 152, 180 and 192) as well as six trace metals (Cu, Zn, Mn, Cd, Pb and Fe). Evidences of long-or short-term exposures to these contaminants as well as its accumulation tendency were assessed by integrating the obtained analytical results of biotic and abiotic components of this aquatic ecosystem. All calculated lifetime cancer risk values for PCBs showed unacceptable risk of cancer for human consumers at both normal and subsistence fish consumption rates. The calculated hazard index for total PCBs indicates that fish are not safe for human consumption except in site 1 at normal consumption rate. Meanwhile, trace metals do not pose unacceptable risks at both consumption rates except for Pb in site 1 at subsistence consumption rate.

However, due to the intensification of human activities since 1850, some scholars have emphasized that the increasing lake trophic level may be the main reason for the changes in diatom communities. The debate is ongoing. In order to avoid falling into the complex relationship between diatom changes and the seasonal cycle that characterizes lakes in mid and high latitudes, we chose a lake located at a low latitude, where the relationship between diatoms and temperature is not indirect but direct. The diatom record spans the past ca. 100 years and reveals that the abundance of Aulacoseira granulata increased from 1900 until 1985, replacing the previously dominant Aulacoseira ambigua. These changes are in agreement with the increasing trend in global temperature. Since 1985, the percentages of the small-celled Discostella stelligera and the benthic diatom Navicula heimansioides have increased, while Aulacoseira granulata has decreased. This latest shift is caused by further global warming. We conclude that warming is the main factor leading to changing diatom communities in Douhu Lake.

The observation data were supplemented with dissolved CH4 measurement and incubation experiments of lake sediment and water. This lake had areas with steady bubble CH4 emissions, shaping the spatial variation in CH4 flux with strong spot emissions. In the other areas, CH4 was emitted via diffusion and episodic ebullition. CH4 emissions from this area had a clear seasonal variation, reflecting temperature variations, with a maximum monthly mean emission of 0.39 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in August. The higher emission in summer was due to higher CH4 production in the sediment and the resulting higher dissolved CH4 concentration in the surface water. The steady bubble CH4 emission was seasonally controlled by the total hydrostatic pressure, with higher emission under lower pressure, suggesting regulation of the amount of bubbles emitted from the lake bottom by pressure. Isotope analysis revealed that this CH4 was produced biologically. This natural gas seepage was estimated to emit 1.9 Mg of CH4 annually. Compared with other eddy covariance studies over inland waters, CH4 emissions from Lake Suwa may be large for the latitude. This may be related to eutrophication, which enhances CH4 production.					; Tokida, Takeshi/F-7203-2010; Itoh, Masayuki/V-9221-2019; Iwata, Hiroki/B-7679-2008	Shen, Feilong/0009-0009-2097-5773; 													0168-1923	1873-2240				DEC 15	2020	295								108184	10.1016/j.agrformet.2020.108184	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2020.108184													WOS:000582305500016

Kinetics experiments with 15N-labeled ammonium and nitrate indicated that the N assimilation rate was generally limited by low ambient concentrations of inorganic N (DIN). The half-saturation constants for DIN assimilation were low (0.7-9.3 .mu.g N .cntdot. l-1) and comparable to ambient levels during the nutrient-depleted, ice-free growing season. Ammonium assimilation was always higher than nitrate assimilation, even when nitrate concentration greatly exceeded ammonium during early summer. This was supported by the results of 13NO3- uptake experiments. The midsummer proliferation of nonheterocystous blue-green algae was accompanied by increased C and N assimilation and higher rates of particulate C and N turnover. C to N and C to maximum N assimilation ratios were generally high, did not show obvious seasonal differences and were not correlated significantly with seston compositional ratios. Apparently, phytoplankton growth is maintained by efficient use of internally regenerated ammonium, in agreement with many such studies in N-deficient marine waters.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1982	27	1					53	65		10.4319/lo.1982.27.1.0053	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1982.27.1.0053													WOS:A1982NA27100005

The biomass of a monospecific community (Chara globularis) and of several communities with high charophyte coverage (C. globularis-Myriophyllum. alterniflorum, C. globularis-Potamogeton gramineus and Nitella translucens-Potamogeton natans) were studied monthly. The weather and hydrological regime had a strong influence on the seasonal biomass patterns and on between-the-year differences in the biomass of macrophytes. The biomass in the monospecific C. globularis community showed a bimodal pattern, with maximum in mid-July (128 g DW m(-2)) and late autumn (165 g DW m(-2)). Chara overwintered as a green plant and during the subsequent growth period, characterised by high temperature and low rainfall, reached a maximum of 305 g DW m(-2) (June 1997). The highest biomass of C. globularis in the Chara-Myriophyllum community was reached in July (Sentiz: 160 g m(-2), Redos: 204 g m(-2)), while the minimum (Sentiz. 10 g m(-2); Redos: 3 g m(-2)) was recorded in February or March. M. alterniflorum (average biomass: 95 g m(-2)) was a better competitor than C. globularis in Redos lake and appeared to be favoured by the early beginning of the growing season in 1997 and by the later increase in the water level. The biomass of N. translutcens (average biomass: 64 g m(-2)) showed a high stability during the study period, but lacked a well-defined seasonal biomass pattern. R natans had a marked maximum biomass in August (426 g m(-2)). Although the stability of the Potamogeton population was low, shading did not have a significant influence on the development of Nitella biomass. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	PARSONS, JW				PARSONS, JW			CONTRIBUTIONS OF YEAR-CLASSES OF BLUE PIKE TO COMMERCIAL FISHERY OF LAKE ERIE, 1943-59	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												The blue pike (Stizostedion vitreum gaucum) contributed about 12.7 million Ibs. annually to the commercial production of fish in Lake Erie in 1915-59. Production averaged about 27% of the total for all species; in some years it exceeded 50%. The catch fluctuated greatly and was featured by a series of 7 "highs" and "lows" during the 45-year period. The landings ranged between 2 million and 26 million lbs.; periods of peak production were 5 to 9 years apart. A sharp decline in the catch started in 1957. The take of 79,000 lbs. in 1959 was the lowest on record to that time. Age and size compositions of the catch were determined from samples of blue pike taken from commercial landings in the fall, 1943-59. Peaks in production in that period were attributed to a few strong year-classes separated by several weak year-classes. Of the 20 year-classes represented in the samples, those of 1944 and 1949 were by far the strongest; together they contributed 42% (by weight) of the fall blue pike production in 1943-59. The strength of the 1939 and 1940 year-classes was moderate and the 1954 year-class was the last one of any importance. The other 15 year-classes were weak. The 1957-59 decline in production was accompanied by a marked increase in rate of growth. Blue pike in age-group III weighed nearly eight times more and were 7.7 in. longer in 1959 than in 1951. Landings after 1958 consisted of only a few large fish. The collapse of the fishery forced blue pike fishermen either to fish for less valuable species or to discontinue operation.																									1967	24	5					1035	+		10.1139/f67-090	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f67-090													WOS:A19679546100011

Variability in spectral absorbance metrics across boreal lake waters	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING												Ultraviolet/visible (UV/Vis) absorbance spectroscopy is a commonly used technique for characterizing dissolved organic matter (DOM). We present an analysis of UV/Vis absorbance spectra from 983 lakes throughout Sweden, sampled during autumn 2009. Metrics included both specific absorbances (i.e. absorbance per mass unit of organic carbon), and descriptions of spectral shape. Overall, we found three factors to which all spectral metrics were similarly related: acidity, retention-time, and latitude. In general, alkaline lakes with a long retention time in northern Sweden have lower specific absorbance and steeper spectral slope than acidic lakes with a short retention time in southern Sweden. Relative to the specific absorbance measured at 254 nm (SUVA), commonly used as a measure of DOM aromaticity, the specific absorbance at longer wavelengths and metrics of spectral shape were more sensitive to acidity and less sensitive to latitude. Although different spectral metrics are hypothesized to reflect different properties of DOM, UV/Vis absorbance spectroscopy may not be useful for more refined characterization of organic matter because of the strong inter-correlation between metrics. Nevertheless, it remains useful as a quick, cheap and reliable method of estimating DOM quantity and describing quality. We suggest that the most informative range to measure absorbance is between approximately 250 and 360 nm, where the between-lake variability is largest and absorbance can, in general, be precisely measured.

J	Kaiser, A				Kaiser, A			Migratory disposition of small passerines in central Europe: Moult, body mass, fat deposition, and stopover length	JOURNAL FUR ORNITHOLOGIE												Data from approximately 200,000 birds caught during their stopover on southward migration at lake Constance (SW Germany) were analysed for the extent of migratory disposition. Variation in migration patterns (the increase in number of arriving birds) correlates well with the onset of migratory disposition in a sub-sample of approximately 13,000 first-captures of 58 species, mainly warblers (Acrocephalus, Sylvia, and Phylloscopus), tits, and thrushes. 72% of all birds partially or fully renewed their body feathers during the study period, indicating that most birds were in the early stage of their migration. Body condition changed significantly with migratory disposition, thus fat deposition increased with decreasing moult intensity, whereas body mass of first captures increased very slowly over time in some species. Differences in ecophysiological parameters were tested among long-, intermediate- and short-distance migrants as well as between the pre-migration and the migration period. Long-distance migrants moulted fast, had a minimum stopover period of only 4.8 days and were considerably fatter than short-distance migrants. During migration 90% of all individuals were captured only once. These ''fast passage migrants'' or transients can be distinguished from ''longer resting birds'' using captures if several factors including moult progress, moult intensity, fat deposition, season, capture time and habitat are considered. A discriminant analysis revealed that age and wing length also had a significant influence on the resting strategy in some populations. Combining results from multi-factor analyses and theoretical flight distance estimates variation in resting strategy supports a hypothesis of small stages and long stopover periods in most individuals and species.

The Shark Bay Salt solar ponds at Useless Inlet in Western Australia vary in salinity from seawater to four times seawater over the pond sequence. We observed a shift from planktonic to benthic primary productivity as salinity increased. Water column photosynthesis and biomass decreased markedly with increasing salinity, while benthic productivity increased as cyanobacterial mats developed. Correspondingly, productivity shifted from autotrophy to heterotrophy in the water column and from heterotrophy to autotrophy in the benthos. Both shifts occurred at intermediate salinity (S = 110 g kg(-1), rho = 1.087 g cm(-3)) in the pond sequence, where there was little production by either. Within individual ponds, productivity, algal biomass and physico-chemical conditions were relatively constant over one year, with only water column photosynthesis significantly different between seasons, mostly due to greater winter production. Transitions between benthic and planktonic production and their relative magnitudes appear to be driven mostly by direct responses to salinity stress, but also by changes in nutrient availability and grazing, which are also influenced by salinity.

Cyanobacteria can produce highly toxic substances such as microcystins (MCs) that affect the health of livestock, wildlife, and humans. The present study broaden the understanding of cyanobacteria ecology and MC dynamics in the field, focusing on the estimation of the production and sedimentation rates of MCs in a natural habitat. The nutrient concentrations of the reservoir water and sediment pore water were monitored at 3-h intervals for 24 h during the summer cyanobacterial bloom. The DIN uptake rate of Microcystis in the Isahaya reservoir was estimated and the large-scale blooms in the reservoir were largely controlled by the interactions between rainfall and nutrient levels in the warm season. By using calculations based on the nitrogen budgets and tracking changes of the MC concentrations in the water column, the total MC production and sedimentation rates were estimated to be 52.2 kg MCs d(-1) and 21.5 kg MCs d(-1) respectively. Although MCs could be degraded in the environment, the MC sedimentation still comprised 41% of the in-water production.					; Komorita, Tomohiro/J-8817-2019	Umehara, Akira/0000-0001-5174-3275; 													0147-6513	1090-2414				NOV 15	2019	183								109477	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.109477	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.109477								31369939					WOS:000487178000003

New host records are reported for chinook salmon Oncorhyncus tshawytscha, and slimy sculpin C. cognatus. Infections were heaviest in members of the Salmonidae. Host-parasite relationship in smelt was most closely analyzed. No pronounced seasonal periodicity in the rate and intensity of infection or worm maturation was observed. Recruitment and maturation occurred throughout the year but were enhanced by colder and warmer temperatures, respectively. Sex ratio was nearest to even in winter. Fifty percent or more of worms were localized in the posterior-most region of host intestine, and posterior migration with maturation was indicated. Heavier infections were noted in larger (older) fishes. Alternative routes of infection of the larger piscivorous salmonids via transfer hosts are suggested. Female hosts were more heavily infected than males. E. salmonis was not shown to seriously threaten its host''s health or survival.																									1977	34	3					325	330		10.1139/f77-053	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f77-053													WOS:A1977DA61100002

Review and test of reproducibility of subdecadal resolution palaeoenvironmental reconstructions from microfossil assemblages	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Very high, even annual, resolution quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions have been generated from microfossil assemblage data using transfer functions. Evidence of the utility of some of these reconstructions is given by the high correlations between the reconstructions and instrumental records. Such performance is despite several ecological and taphonomic issues that can become more problematic at subdecadal resolution than at multidecadal resolution. This paper explores these timescale dependent issues and tests the reproducibility of the several of published reconstructions. It demonstrates that the previously reported exceptionally good performance of several published chironomid-based reconstructions is not reproducible. (C) 2019 The Author.

The core is precisely dated with 49 dates and the dataset comprises 372 pollen samples providing high temporal resolution. We obtained quantitative reconstructions of annual temperature (Tann) and precipitation (Pann) based on comparison with a modern pollen dataset comprising 604 data sites for which climate correlation coefficients are high (R-2 = 0.76 for Tann and R-2 = 0.70 for Pann) and the uncertainties are relatively small (RMSEP = 1.99 C-degrees for Tann and RMSEP = 46.22 mm for Pann). Results show that the climate in the northern Mongolian Plateau experienced a warm-dry climate in the early Holocene (similar to 10,300 to similar to 7900 cal. yr BP), a stable cool-wet climate in the middle and early-late Holocene (similar to 7900 to similar to 2300 cal. yr BP), and an increasingly cool-wet climate in more recent times (last similar to 2300 years). The high temperature in the northern Mongolian Plateau before similar to 7900 cal. yr BP is attributable to the thermal sensitivity of the interior Asian continent to high summer insolation. The nearly constant and rather stable temperature during the past similar to 7900 years is most likely the result of the thermal insensitivity of the welldeveloped and densely-covered Taiga forests in south Siberia to declining summer insolation. Increasing precipitation in the northern Mongolian Plateau in the period before similar to 7900 cal. yr BP is similar to coeval records from the Altai Mountains, the Yinshan Mountains and the Lake Baikal basin, and most likely resulted from rising sea surface temperature both in the North Atlantic Ocean and in the Western Tropical Pacific Ocean. The stable and nearly constant precipitation during the past similar to 7900 years most likely resulted from the combined effect of decreasing water vapor supply from the cooling Western Tropical Pacific Ocean and the increasing water vapor supply from the warming North Atlantic Ocean.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				MAR 15	2024	638								112028	10.1016/j.palaeo.2024.112028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2024.112028		JAN 2024											WOS:001167654400001

The flow of groundwater into the lake introduces a suspension of marry and argilaceous materials. The temperature of this slurry is nearly constant throughout the year, around 19 degrees C. The lake is formed by 6 basins and at the bottom of these basins there are 12 sources where the presence of suspended material signifies entering groundwater (Figure 1). Suspension of bottom lake sediment by groundwater is a feature of Lake Banyoles that has not been described elsewhere. Here we present experimental results which show that the maximum height that the sediment can rise to is affected by the formation of aggregates.

Mysis held in bioassay chambers demonstrated a 16-h LC50 value of 1.0 mg dissolved oxygen/L. Avoidance chamber experiments revealed that Mysis could detect and move away from areas of low dissolved oxygen concentrations. It is suggested that Mysis, which has been used as an indicator of oligotrophic conditions, could survive in a mesotrophic or eutrophic lake that undergoes oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion by moving upward in the water column.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				NOV	1987	65	11					2646	2650		10.1139/z87-401	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z87-401													WOS:A1987L725200013

The resulting weather patterns are analyzed in terms of duration, station, gridded precipitation, storm tracks, and climate teleconnections. Five distinct weather patterns are identified. Weather type (WT) 1 is characterized by a ridge over the western Atlantic and positive precipitation anomalies as far north as the Great Lakes; WT2, by a trough along the eastern United States and positive precipitation anomalies into southern New England; WT3, by a trough over the western Atlantic and negative precipitation anomalies along much of the U.S. East Coast; WT4, by a trough east of Newfoundland and negative precipitation anomalies along parts of the U.S. East Coast; and WT5, by a broad, shallow trough over southeastern Canada and negative precipitation anomalies over the entire U.S. East Coast. WT5 and WT1 are the most persistent, while WT2 typically progresses quickly to WT3 and then to WT4. Based on mean station precipitation in the northeastern United States, most precipitation occurs in WT2 and WT3, with the least in WT1 and WT4. Extreme precipitation occurs most frequently in WT2. Storm tracks show that WT2 and WT3 are associated with coastal storms, while WT2 is also associated with Great Lakes storms. Teleconnections are linked with a change in WT frequency by more than a factor of 2 in several cases: for the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in WT1 and WT4 and for the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern in WT1 and WT3.					; Moron, Vincent/ABI-5722-2020	Qian, Jianhua/0000-0002-6970-6322; Moron, Vincent/0000-0002-4981-9530; Barlow, Mathew/0000-0002-7612-3811													0894-8755	1520-0442				APR	2016	29	8					2963	2980		10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0274.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0274.1													WOS:000375146100005

The local ichthyofauna consists of 11 species, including anadromous (Atlantic salmon or summer salmon), semidiadromous (Siberian whitefish), and nonmigratory species. The Siberian whitefish, an invader, forms a semidiadromous lake-and-river form here. A trend towards an increasing role of Siberian whitefish in the formation of the fish part of the aquatic community in a wide range of the lakes located in the mountainous belt area has been identified along with a decreasing share of the previously dominant perch.

J	BOWLING, LC; TYLER, PA				BOWLING, LC; TYLER, PA			CHEMICAL STRATIFICATION AND PARTIAL MEROMIXIS IN RESERVOIRS IN TASMANIA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												During the first summer after impoundment, chemical stratification occurred in four deep, steep-sided reservoirs of the Pieman River Power Develpment, Tasmania, under the influence of thermal stratification and anoxic hypolimnia caused by decaying vegetation in the flooded river valleys. Marked increases occurred in temperature, conductivity, pH, and in concentrations of dissolved iron, manganese, calcium, magnesium and bicarbonate in the sulphuretted, reducing, waters which accumulated as monimolimnetic pools adjacent to the dams. This partial, incipient meromixis persisted only in Lake Murchison, where a shallow monimolimnetic pool remained three years later. In the other reservoirs of the Pieman scheme it decayed after one or two years. Reservoir morphometry, degree of shelter, nature of major inflows, and alignment with respect to prevailing winds, are primary factors determining the persistence or eventual decay of chemical stratification in the respective impoundments. In Lake Barrington, another meromictic Tasmanian reservoir, the initial chemical gradient decayed and virtually disappeared, but was reestablished with greater severity than on any previous occasion. The severity of partial meromixis may wax and wane in relation to seasonal or longer-term meteorological events.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				APR 9	1990	194	1					67	83		10.1007/BF00012113	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00012113													WOS:A1990DB76100007

Early pre-ore quartz cementation forming immediately above Zone 4 produced a 200-m-thick silicified zone within the lower Manitou Falls Formation. Late pre-ore oxidizing basinal fluids (delta O-18 = 1.1-8.9 parts per thousand, delta H-2 = -70 to -34 parts per thousand) formed zones of dickite, magnesiofoitite, and sudoite-rich alteration in the Manitou Falls Formation above the deposit. These zones were overprinted by an outer halo of illite and illite-chlorite mixed-layer clay that coincided with illite and clinochlore alteration of the Wollaston Group basement rocks. Circulation of basinal fluids into the fault zone, promoted by fault reactivation, created a reducing fluid (delta O-18 = 3.9-7.8 parts per thousand, delta H-2= -62 to -25 parts per thousand) through basement interaction, which formed a narrow sudoite alteration halo near the faulted unconformity. Mixing of these two contrasting fluids initiated uranium mineralization at ca. 1600 Ma. Post-ore alteration caused isotopic resetting of primary uraninite, broadly coincident with the intrusion of the Mackenzie dikes into the basin, followed by alteration of uraninite to coffinite, poorly crystalline uraninite, and gummite during the Neoproterozoic. Cool (ca. 10 degrees C), oxidizing, meteoric waters (delta O-18 = -15.7 to -13.2 parts per thousand, delta H-2 = -120 to -93 parts per thousand) later infiltrated fractures, produced post-ore kaolinite, and caused partial oxidation of uraninite to uranophane. The silicified zone at Zone 4 functioned as a physical barrier to fluid flow, creating favorable conditions for uranium mineralization by focusing basinal fluids into the fault zone, localizing reducing basement-modified basinal fluids, and enhancing ore preservation. However, the silicified zone limited the spatial extent of late pre-ore sudoite alteration and obstructed the post-ore mobilization of components such as radiogenic Pb and other pathfinder elements into the overlying strata.

Twenty chydorid species were collected in 15 over-night sets of funnel traps in each of four habitat types. Analysis of variance multivariate analysis of variance, and discriminant function analysis revealed that assemblages differed among the habitats. Alona intermedia, Alona quadrangularis and Chydorus bicornutus were particularly abundant in the most structurally diverse habitat type - muddy, rock-strewn areas with approximately 40% bottom cover by the pipewort, Eriocaulon septangulare. In contrast, Anchistropus cf. minor was caught most often on bare shelves of rock. A second set of analyses demonstrated that chydorid assemblages also differed at a smaller scale, i.e. with local patchiness in bottom cover by the dominant macrophyte (E. septangulare). The abundance of Alona affinis was positively correlated with cover by E. septangulare, whereas Anchistropus cf. minor was caught mainly in microhabitats without vegetation. Alona intermedia and A. quadrangularis were most abundant in microhabitats with intermediate amounts of vegetation, suggesting their abundance is influenced by habitat factors other than vegetation.

J	Yang, P; Yang, CH; Yin, HB				Yang, Pan; Yang, Chunhui; Yin, Hongbin			Dynamics of phosphorus composition in suspended particulate matter from a turbid eutrophic shallow lake (Lake Chaohu, China): Implications for phosphorus cycling and management	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Particulate phosphorus (P) dominates the total P (TP) content in lacustrine water columns and is a primary source of dissolved P in turbid eutrophic shallow lakes. However, the spatiotemporal variability of P compositions in suspended particulate matter (SPM) remains poorly understood. In this study, we applied chemical extraction and solution P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (P-31 NMR) to assess the seasonal variations of SPM P compositions from a shallow turbid lake (Lake Chaohu, China) and its main river tributaries. P fractionation analysis indicated that mobile P (the sum of labile-P, iron-bound P, and organic P) accounted for N60% of the TP in SPM and showed high spatiotemporal variability throughout the year-long field investigation. In most seasons, riverine SPM (in urban rivers or rivers with high flow) contained a higher mobile P content than that of the lake and was therefore a dominant source of lacustrine mobile particulate P. Solution P-31 NMR identified five types of P compounds in SPM, with highest contributions from orthophosphate. Organic P components and concentrations showed high seasonal variability, and elevated p values occurred during the summer algal bloom. The correlation analysis between organic and inorganic P fractions inferred the possible degradation of organic P into reactive inorganic components of SPM. Consequently, biological or chemical processes would further transform the labile inorganic P into soluble reactive phosphorus, which is readily utilized by lacustrine algae. Our results suggest that the labile forms of P in SPM were highly dynamic and significantly contributed to the eutrophication of the turbid shallow lake. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Five systems of shallow lakes are distinguished in the regions under study: Barguzin, Eravna-Gusinoozersk, Ingoda, Onon-Borzya, and Eastern-Mongolian systems. The shallow lakes are sub-grouped according to common chemical compositions and geochemical evolution types. Characteristics of ground-and surface waters feeding the lakes are considered. Based on results of trace element analyses of water samples from about 200 lakes and more than 100 springs, wells and boreholes, elements that manifest higher concentrations, resulting from evaporation of lacustrine waters, are determined. Prospects of assessment of ore-generating potential of the shallow lakes as 'liquid ore'sources in view of commercial extraction of Li, U, REE, and others metals are discussed.

Nutritional quality of littoral macroinvertebrates and pelagic zooplankton in subarctic lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Littoral benthic primary production is considered the most important energy source of consumers in subarctic lakes. We analyzed essential fatty acid (EFA) and amino acid (EAA) content of 23 littoral benthic macroinvertebrate taxa as well as cladocerans and copepods from pelagic and littoral habitats of 8-9 subarctic lakes to compare their nutritional quality. Pelagic crustacean zooplankton had significantly higher EFA and total FA content (on average 2.6-fold and 1.6-fold, respectively) than littoral macroinvertebrates in all our study lakes. Specifically, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), one of the most important EFA for juvenile fish, was almost exclusively found in pelagic copepods. In littoral macroinvertebrates, onlyLymnaea(Gastropoda),Eurycercus(Cladocera), andGammarus(Amphipoda) contained a low amount of DHA, whereas most littoral invertebrate taxa contained moderate amounts of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The difference in DHA content may explain why so many generalist fish shift their diet to pelagic zooplankton at their peak abundance in mid/late-summer. Meanwhile, the differences in EAA content between pelagic zooplankton and littoral invertebrates were much lower than for EFA suggesting a wider availability of EAA in subarctic lakes, except for methionine. In the studied subarctic lakes, EFA and EAA variation in consumers was more related to taxon-specific than lake-specific characteristics. This indicates that climate-induced changes in the abundance and community structure of zooplankton vs. littoral macroinvertebrates will be important parameters in determining the availability of EFA and EAA to juvenile fish, and potentially fish production.					; Taipale, Sami/AAO-3492-2020; Keva, Ossi/S-5759-2019	Taipale, Sami/0000-0001-7510-7337; Vesterinen, Jussi/0000-0003-3126-2698; Keva, Ossi/0000-0002-5381-3879; Kahilainen, Kimmo/0000-0002-1539-014X; Strandberg, Ursula/0000-0001-5380-6129; Kankaala, Paula/0000-0002-1422-2806; Hiltunen, Minna/0000-0002-0003-3000													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2021	66			1	SI		S81	S97		10.1002/lno.11563	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11563		JUL 2020											WOS:000551567100001

Epiphytic algae were gathered monthly by collecting aquatic plants between November 2011 and October 2012, except in winter when there were no plants. In this study, 67 taxa on N. alba, 66 taxa on C. demersum and 66 taxa on T. latifolia were identified as epiphytic algae. The mean value of species richness was 17, that of diversity was 1.5 and that of evenness was 0.54 for epiphytic algae on N. alba, 17, 1.1, and 0.39 on C. demersum, and 18, 1.64, and 0.56 on T. latifolia, respectively. Oscillatoria sp. and Komvophoron crassum (Vozzen) Anagnostidis and Komarek were the most abundant and consistent epiphytic algal species, occurring in high abundance on all macrophytes. Results show that species composition of epiphytic algae was different, but diversity values were similar on all the macrophytes. The hydrological pulse is one of the most important factors determining the physical and chemical environment of the epiphytic algal community. However, substrate type also affected the colonization by F. capucina, O. sancta, P. catenata, and L. truncicola more than the epiphytic algal seasonality.

J	STEFAN, HG; FANG, X				STEFAN, HG; FANG, X			DISSOLVED-OXYGEN MODEL FOR REGIONAL LAKE ANALYSIS	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A deterministic, one-dimensional, unsteady dissolved oxygen (D.O.) model has been formulated to simulate summer D.O. conditions (stratification) in a wide range of lakes of the north central United States and to study potential impacts of global climate change. The simulation includes contributions by photosynthesis, plant respiration, reaeration, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and sedimentary oxygen demand (SOD) as source and sink terms. The one-dimensional vertical oxygen transport equation is solved in conjunction with the heat transport equation in daily time steps beginning 1 March and ending 31 October. Lake morphometry, trophic status and daily weather parameters have to be specified as input, and daily profiles of water temperature and dissolved oxygen are obtained as output. The model finds the onset of summer-stratification from initially isothermal and constant D.O. conditions. Trophic status is related to Secchi depth, phytoplankton (chlorophyll-alpha) concentrations, BOD and SOD. Field data from seven lakes (11 years) have been used to calibrate and validate the D.O. model. The simulations for dimictic lakes with strong stratification are better than for weakly stratified polymictic lakes, i.e. the model works better for deep lakes than for shallow lakes. The average standard errors for calibration and validation are 1.4 and 1.9 mg D.O. l(-1), respectively. The temperature simulations, especially the mixed-layer depth, affect the D.O. simulation results. A sensitivity analysis to model coefficients was also conducted. The model is most sensitive to sedimentary oxygen demand (SOD). Twenty seven classes of lakes (3 depths X 3 areas X 3 trophic states) in the north central U.S. were analyzed with the model. Simulated mean daily dissolved oxygen concentrations in the epilimnion are near saturation, those in the hypolimnion vary considerably depending particularly on length of time since the onset of stratification and the sedimentary oxygen demand.																			0304-3800					JAN	1994	71	1-3					37	68		10.1016/0304-3800(94)90075-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800(94)90075-2													WOS:A1994MU61000003

The relationship between morphology and site-occupancy provides opportunities to infer differences in dispersal and flight ability, but empirical data for aquatic insects is limited. 2. In this study, 17 species of caddisflies from 10 families were collected from springs, streams and lakes, and total body mass, relative thorax mass, relative wing area (wing loading), and the aspect ratio of the fore and hind wings (combined) were measured. 3. Partial least-squares regression analysis of two independent distributional data sets produced significant models within which total body mass, relative thorax mass and wing loading were positively associated with site-occupancy, whereas aspect ratio was negatively associated with site-occupancy. 4. These results suggest that the faunal composition of streams is influenced by species dispersal abilities.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	2004	49	6					810	817		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01229.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01229.x													WOS:000221492000011

Factors Affecting the Inland and Orographic Enhancement of Lake-Effect Precipitation over the Tug Hill Plateau	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												The factors affecting the inland and orographic enhancement of lake-effect precipitation are poorly understood, yet critical for operational forecasting. Here we use nine cool seasons (16 November-15 April) of radar data from the Montague/Ft. Drum, New York (KTYX), WSR-88D, the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), and observations from the Ontario Winter Lake-effect Systems (OWLeS) field campaign to examine variations in lake-effect precipitation enhancement east of Lake Ontario and over the Tug Hill Plateau (hereafter Tug Hill). Key factors affecting the inland and orographic enhancement in this region include the strength of the incident boundary layer flow, the intensity of the lake-induced convective available potential energy (LCAPE), and the mode of the lake-effect system. Stronger flow favors higher precipitation rates, a precipitation maximumdisplaced farther downwind, and greater inland and orographic enhancement. The effects of LCAPE depend upon the strength of the flow. During periods of weak flow, higher LCAPE favors lower precipitation rates, a maximum closer to the shoreline, and lesser inland and orographic enhancement. During periods of strong flow, higher LCAPE favors higher precipitation rates, a maximum displaced farther downwind, and greater inland and orographic enhancement. Banded (nonbanded) modes favor higher (lower) precipitation rates, lesser (greater) inland and orographic enhancement, and a maximum closer to the shoreline (over Tug Hill). These results, for both manually measured and radar-estimated precipitation, are robust when many lake-effect events are considered, but substantial variability exists during individual events.

Distribution and habitat characteristics of Manayunkia speciosa and infection prevalence with the parasite Ceratomyxa shasta in the Klamath River, Oregon-California	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												A survey for Manayunkia speciosa, the freshwater polychaete host for the myxozoan parasite Ceratomyxa shasta, was conducted from 2003 to 2005 as part of an integrated study of the epizootiology of ceratomyxosis in Klamath River salmonids. Substrata samples (n = 257) were collected in a variety of habitats from Klamath Lake to the mouth of the Klamath River to document occurrence and relative abundance of the polychaete by habitat type and to estimate the prevalence of C. shasta within selected polychaete populations. Populations of M. specios a were identified throughout the Klamath River within pools (51.6%), eddy-pools (47.0%), and runs (40.0%). Large populations of M. speciosa were consistently found at the inflow to the main-stem reservoirs where densities were correlated with distance from the inflow into the reservoir. Using polymerase chain reaction assay and composite samples, 12 of 71 populations identified were tested for C. shasta, revealing a mean infection prevalence of 0.27%. An area of elevated infection prevalence (4.9 and 8.3%) was identified with 2 populations below a barrier to salmonid migration, which explains the high infectious spore densities demonstrated in concurrent studies and observations of C. shasta-induced mortality in Klamath River fall Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha).																			0022-3395	1937-2345				FEB	2007	93	1					78	88		10.1645/GE-939R.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1645/GE-939R.1								17436945					WOS:000245221400012

Western European populations of the European Roller (Coracias garrulus), the only member of the roller family of birds to breed in Europe, differ substantially in their predicted flight directions, leading to different hypotheses being suggested for passage areas and non-breeding destinations. In this study we have tested the hypotheses on a western or eastern detour and different crossings of the Sahara desert by tracking European Rollers breeding in southern France using light-level geolocators. After the departure from the breeding site between mid and end July, the three European Rollers which were tracked crossed the Mediterranean and the Sahara desert heading in straight southern direction. When arriving in the Sahelian zone they abruptly changed their direction eastwards to circumvent the Gulf of Guinea and reached the western Lake Chad basin, where they made a final direction shift to reach the non-breeding sites in western Angola. Our findings support the hypothesis of a straight north-south Sahara crossing with subsequent directional shifts. Whether western Africa serves as the non-breeding residence of European Rollers from the Iberian Peninsula and northern Africa remains to be elucidated.

Surface energy balance and melt thresholds over 11 years at Taylor Glacier, Antarctica	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												In the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Victoria Land, Antarctica, melting of glacial ice is the primary source of water to streams, lakes, and associated ecosystems. To understand geochemical fluxes and ecological responses to past and future climates requires a physically based energy balance model. We applied a one-dimensional model to one site on Taylor Glacier using 11 years of daily meteorological data and seasonal ablation measurements. Inclusion of transmission of solar radiation into the ice was necessary to accurately model summer ablation and ice temperatures. Results showed good correspondence between calculated and measured ablation and ice temperatures over the 11 years. Ablation (similar to 18 cm a(-1)) was dominated by sublimation with very few occurrences of melt (42 days during 11 years). Results also indicated that above freezing air temperatures did not necessarily result in melt and, in turn, melt occurred during subfreezing air temperatures under some conditions. For air temperatures near freezing, low wind speed was critically important for melt initiation. According to the model, subsurface melt, away from rocks and sediment in the ice, occurred three times more frequently than surface melt; occurs no deeper than 50 cm below the glacier surface; and was small, never exceeding 8% by mass. The magnitude of subsurface melting and the energy balance indicate that Taylor Glacier ice is intermediate in optical properties between snow and blue ice.																			2169-9003	2169-9011				DEC 17	2008	113	F4							F04014	10.1029/2008JF001029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2008JF001029													WOS:000261884500001
J	Stárková, M; Rapprich, V; Breitkreuz, C				Starkova, Marcela; Rapprich, Vladislav; Breitkreuz, Christoph			Variable eruptive styles in an ancient monogenetic volcanic field: examples from the Permian Levin Volcanic Field (Krkonose Piedmont Basin, Bohemian Massif)	JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The Permian pyroclastic deposits of the Levin Volcanic Field within the Krkonose Piedmont Basin were studied in terms of volcanology. Pyroclastic rocks are exposed in two quarries and the study was supported with a 30 m deep borehole K1 penetrating these rocks. The pyroclastic rocks are altered but preserved textures enable reconstruction of eruptive styles. The volcanic sequence exposed in the abandoned Hvezda quarry starts with a phreato-Strombolian pyroclastic rocks rich in basaltic scoria, cuspate glass shards, armoured- and accretionary lapilli overlain with mafic lava. Subsequent activity was phreatomagmatic in style and produced fall-out of accretionary lapilli and accumulation of base surge deposits. Overlying subhorizontally bedded matrix-supported pyroclastic deposits are rich in scoria and contain spindle-shaped bombs. These rocks are interpreted as mafic pyroclastic flow deposits related to Strombolian eruptions. A similar succession capped by scoriaceous fall-out deposit was documented in the K1 borehole. A coherent mafic volcanic rock (lava or sill) terminates the succession exposed in the Hvezda quarry. Agglutinates at the base of the Studenec quarry were produced during Hawaiian eruptions building up a spatter cone. The cone most probably dammed a stream and created an ephemeral lake. Increasing influence of water on eruptive styles is documented in overlying pyroclastic deposits of phreatomagmatic eruptions. Subsequent lava flowed into the lake. Quenching of the lava resulted in formation of pillows enclosed in hyaloclastite breccia. Further up in the exposure, transition of pillow to massive lava has been recognized. Overlaying pyroclastic deposits are matrix-supported and rich in scoria and spindle-shaped bombs. Similarly to the Hvezda quarry, these are interpreted as mafic pyroclastic flow deposits. Volcanic activity in the Levin Volcanic Field was characterized by Hawaiian, Strombolian, phreato-Strombolian and phreatomagmatic eruptions accompanying lava effusions and possibly sills emplacement. The lavas were emitted in both subaerial and subaquatic conditions. The character and distribution of volcaniclastic facies suggests existence of several monogenetic volcanoes.

J	Marescaux, A; Thieu, V; Garnier, J				Marescaux, Audrey; Thieu, Vincent; Garnier, Josette			Carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions from the human-impacted Seine watershed in France	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from rivers and lakes have been shown to contribute significantly to global carbon and nitrogen cycling. In temperate and human-impacted regions, simultaneous carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions from aquatic systems are poorly documented. We estimated carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the Seine hydrosystem (71,730 km(2), France) using direct measurements, and calculations of CO2 partial pressures from 14 field campaigns conducted between 2010 and 2017, and compared them to methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) concentrations. In the main stem of the Seine River, CO2 showed the same spatial gradient as N2O and CH4 with peaks in concentration downstream from the arrival of effluents from wastewater treatment plants enriched in organic matter, thus favoring mineralization. It is likely that high CO2 concentrations upstream were due to organic carbon inputs from soils and enriched CO2 groundwater discharges, whereas high N2O and CH4 upstream values were likely due to denitrification in riparian wet areas and anoxic decomposition of organic matter-rich wetlands, respectively. In addition, seasonal variations in all three GHGs were observed with higher concentrations in summer when higher temperatures promote mineralization and low water reduces the dilution of organic matter mainly originating from WWTP effluents. GHG emissions were calculated and compared with agricultural and nonagricultural (urban, transport) fluxes in the basin. In the Seine River network, CO2 emissions dominated riverine GHG emissions, reaching 95.3%, while N2O and CH4 emissions accounted for 4.4% and 0.3%, respectively. These indirect emissions from the hydrosystem were estimated to account for 3.7% of the total GHG emissions from the basin that amounted to 61,284 Gg CO(2)eq yr(-1). Comparatively, direct agricultural and nonagricultural GHG emissions were estimated at 23.3% and 73.0%., respectively. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, without a description of their uncertainty, practitioners cannot know if they provide quality information. We pose that part of the foundation for the description of uncertainty is an assessment of the ability of the underlying climate model to represent the meteorological or weather-scale processes. Here, we demonstrate an assessment of precipitation processes for the Great Lakes region using the Bias Corrected and Spatially Downscaled (BCSD) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) projections. A major weakness of the underlying models is their inability to simulate the effects of the Great Lakes, which is an important issue for most global climate models. There is also uncertainty among the models in the timing of transition between dominant precipitation processes going from the warm to cool season and vice versa. In addition, warm-season convective precipitation processes very greatly among the models. From the assessment, we discuss how process-based uncertainties in the models are inherited by the downscaled projections and how bias correction increases uncertainty in cases where precipitation processes are not well represented. Implications of these findings are presented for three regional examples: lake-effect snow, the spring seasonal transition, and summertime lake-effect precipitation.					; Rood, Richard/C-5611-2008	Krmenec, Andrew/0000-0003-1946-8319; 													0177-798X	1434-4483				FEB	2017	127	3-4					643	654		10.1007/s00704-015-1652-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-015-1652-2													WOS:000393667700010

In Jack's Lake, Ontario, 72-98% of the assemblage was comprised of cells with a single excitation peak for chlorophyll (Chl) a (emission at 680 nm) at 565 (+/-3) nm, the excitation spectra for chlorophyll (Chl) a composition of downwelling irradiance. The assemblage was, therefore, dominated by a single phycobiliprotein pigment type, similar to type 2 phycoerythrin (PE) marine Synechococcus strains. The shape of excitation spectra did not change significantly with depth down to 0.6% of incident irradiance or between sampling dates, although the relative intensity of the PL excitation peak was generally greater for populations below the thermocline compared to surface populations during summer stratification. Two separate populations of PE-containing picocyanobacteria, distinguished based on their morphology and plane of division, could be further separated based on their emission spectra (using blue excitation): a Synechocystis type cell (PE-Sys) consistently had a more pronounced peak at 665 nm from allophycocyanin compared to a Synechocystis (PE-Syn) type cell. In addition, the ratio of the PE to Chl a peak emissions was higher in PE-Sys and increased significantly with depth below the thermocline. While nitrogen was limiting in the lake in summer, experimental additions of nitrogen did not significantly affect this ratio in surface water populations, but increased the ratio in PE-Syn populations at the base of the photic zone. For surface assemblages of picocyanobacteria, high irradiance may be more important in regulating fluorescence characteristics than nitrogen stress.

Carbon sink to source: longitudinal gradients of planktonic P:R ratios in subtropical reservoirs	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Spatial patterns of planktonic production and respiration in the surface mixed layer were examined in eight Texas, USA reservoirs to test the hypothesis that P:R ratios are lowest in upreservoir inflow zones and highest in downreservoir open-water zones, as predicted by the heuristic reservoir zonation model. We measured summer planktonic metabolism with light-dark bottles and physical-chemical conditions in epilimnetic water at 85 sites distributed among sixteen longitudinal transects within the eight reservoirs (2 transects per reservoir). Volumetric production and plankton biomass were lowest in the open-water zones and increased upreservoir; however, that pattern was reversed for areal production due to greater photic depths at open-water sites. Volumetric respiration was similar in the three zones; however, corresponding planktonic P:R ratios in the surface mixed layer were significantly lower at open-water sites, which is opposite than hypothesized. Based on linear regressions of production and respiration rates on chlorophyll a, open-water sites were net heterotrophic during the summer regardless of trophic state; whereas inflow and mid-reservoir zone sites were heterotrophic when chlorophyll concentrations were respectively less than 9.5 and 35 mg m(-3). Although variation among reservoirs was high, five of the eight reservoirs had inflow zones that were net carbon sinks while seven had open-water zones that were carbon sources. Mean (+/- standard error) carbon flux rates of inflow, mid-reservoir, and open-water zones were -0.22 +/- A 0.12 (C sink), 0.39 +/- A 0.44 (moderate C source), and 1.33 +/- A 0.50 (strong C source) g C m(-2) day(-1) respectively.

Therefore, omitting their contribution as often done when a single open-water site is sampled may substantially overestimate reservoir carbon flux.					; Brooks, Bryan/B-2612-2010; Scott, Thad/AAF-7151-2020	Scott, Thad/0000-0002-9487-9698; Brooks, Bryan/0000-0002-6277-9852; 													0168-2563					FEB	2012	107	1-3					81	93		10.1007/s10533-010-9533-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-010-9533-3													WOS:000298226700006
J	Sutela, T; Vehanen, T; Rask, M				Sutela, Tapio; Vehanen, Teppo; Rask, Martti			Assessment of the ecological status of regulated lakes: stressor-specific metrics from littoral fish assemblages	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Following the European Water Framework Directive (WFD), the ecological status of lakes should be classified based mainly on biota, including fish fauna. In Finnish regulated lakes, littoral fish assemblages may be especially vulnerable to winter drawdown in water level. In this study, we sampled littoral fish assemblages by electrofishing in 14 regulated and 9 reference lakes, and developed three stressor-specific metrics based on total fish density, proportion of disturbance-sensitive species, and occurrence of juveniles. Ecological status was classified from bad to high in regulated lakes, whereas standard WFD assessment based on NORDIC gillnet sampling indicated high status and no response to water level regulation. We suggest that stressor-specific metrics should be integrated into the assessment of the ecological status of regulated lakes in the WFD.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT	2011	675	1					55	64		10.1007/s10750-011-0795-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-011-0795-0													WOS:000293643700006

LARGE-SCALE MOVEMENT AND MIGRATION OF NORTHERN SAW-WHET OWLS IN EASTERN NORTH AMERICA	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												We used information compiled by the U.S. Geological Survey's Bird Banding Laboratory and geographic information systems (GIS) analysis to identify trends in annual Northern Saw-whet Owl (Aegolius acadicus) movement across eastern North America. Analysis of 81,584 Northern Saw-whet Owl banding events revealed a southbound annual fall migration front with peak banding activity occurring progressively later in the season as latitude decreases. Northbound owls comprised <9% of owls banded and recaptured elsewhere in the same season, and <5% were recaptured northbound >100 km from banding location. There was no relationship between banding latitude and adult-to-juvenile ratio. However, the proportion of adults versus juveniles banded was not uniform among banding stations, suggesting age-differentiated migration patterns may exist. Information from multiyear foreign recaptures revealed that 72% of owls banded and subsequently recaptured at the same latitude in different years were recaptured <100 km from banding location. A similar trend was found in the Appalachian Mountains, the Great Lakes Basin, and the Atlantic seaboard. This indicates that Northern Saw-whet Owls may exhibit high migration route fidelity. These findings expand the Northern Saw-whet Owl information portfolio and illustrate the versatility of aggregate data sets as a tool for answering large-scale questions regarding migration.

Nutrient addition bioassay and phytoplankton community structure monitored during autumn in Xiangxi Bay of Three Gorges Reservoir, China	CHEMOSPHERE												The increasing freshwater ecosystem nutrient budget is a critical anthropogenic factor promoting freshwater eutrophication and episodic bloom of harmful algae which threaten water quality and public health. To understand how the eutrophic freshwater ecosystem responds in term of phytoplankton community structure dynamics to a sudden rise in nutrient concentrations, a microcosm study by nutrient addition bioassay was implemented in Xiangxi Bay (XXB) of Three Gorges Reservoir, China. Our results showed that dissolved trace elements supply adequately altered the phytoplankton community structure creating a regime shift from cyanobacteria-dominated to essentially Chlorophytes-dominated system, relative abundance (>70%). Combined N, P, and Si led to maximum growth stimulation accompanied by the highest chlorophyll yield (82.7 +/- 14.01 mu gL(-1)) and growth rate (1.098 +/- 0.12 mu gL(-1)d(-1)). N separate additions resulted in growth responses which did not differ while P-addition differed significantly (p angle 0.05) with the control justifying a P limited system. Si enrichment stimulated diatom growth, relative abundance (20.62%) and maximum utility rate (U-Si = 83.37 +/- 0.33%). This study also reveals that increasing nutrient loading from anthropogenic sources adequately decrease the ecological diversity (H < 1) and community overlap (CC <= 0.5) intensifying competition and succession which then select the fast-growing taxa to dominate and expand. Result points to the need for multiple nutrient control of N, P and Si loading into XXB through a prudent nutrient management protocol for lasting bloom mitigation in the tributary bay.

Elemental concentrations determined in crayfish differed in tissues, seasons, and gender. Both sexes showed lower concentrations in abdominal muscle than in hepatopancreas. Essential metals accumulated in higher concentrations in both tissues than non-essential elements, while associations between essential metals were stronger, especially for females; however, a strong correlation was also observed between Cu and Ag in both sexes. No significant differences in concentrations were recorded between sexes for all seasons; contrarily, significant differences among the total seasonal concentrations (males plus females) were observed only for essential metals and for Ag. Seasonal Toxic Contamination Index (TCI) for Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, and Hg were calculated to assess the toxicity level of metals in the sediments. TCI higher than 1 was detected for Ni only in summer, confirming the close connection between the fluctuating hydrological levels of the shallow Lake Trasimeno, strongly dependent on precipitation, and the metal contamination levels of sediments.

J	Sharma, S; Shukla, AD				Sharma, Shubhra; Shukla, Anil D.			Factors governing the pattern of glacier advances since the Last Glacial Maxima in the transitional climate zone of the Southern Zanskar Ranges, NW Himalaya	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The present study investigates the relics of glacier advances and retreats in the transitional climatic zone of the Southern Zanskar Range, NW Himalaya in response to the temporal changes in the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) and mid-latitude westerlies. The study identifies four glacier advances which are named from the oldest to youngest as the Southern Zanskar Glacier Stage-4 (SZS-4) to SZS-1. The SZS-4 remains undated, however based on the existing chronology of the stratigraphically equivalent moraines/trimlines in the region; it is conjectured to the Marine Isotope Stage-4 (MIS-4). The optical chronology obtained during the present study dates the SZS-3 to 22.8 +/- 1.9-19.1 +/- 1.9 ka which corresponds to the Last Glacial Maxima (LGM). The SZS-2 is dated to 15.7 +/- 1.3-143 +/- 1.3 ka (late Glacial period) whereas, based on the chronology of the recessional moraines (4.9 +/- 0.4-4.5 +/- 0.3 ka) the youngest SZS-1 is assigned to similar to 6 ka (mid -Holocene). The snout proximal moraines are attributed to the Little Ice Age (LIA)/historical times. The pulsating deglaciation associated with each advance since the LGM is represented by the recessional moraines and outwash gravel terraces. The older gravel terrace is dated between 10.8 +/- 0.9 and 6.5 +/- 0.5 ka and is attributed to SZS-2 deglaciation which is also manifested by the deposition of sandy facies in a relict lake sequence (6.7 +/- 0.6 ka) and development of palaeosol (5.6 +/- 0.5 ka). We propose that the glacial advances were triggered by the millennial scale cooling events during the periods of strengthened westerlies and thus, suggest a synoptic scale coupling with the Northern Atlantic. The deglaciation is suggested to occur during the warmer ISM dominated phases. The late Holocene climatic instability that followed the recession of SZS-1 is manifested by the development of rhythmites (3.8 +/- 0.5 ka), loess (2.5 +/- 0.2 ka), and palaeosol (2189 +/- 296 cal yr BP).

J	Round, V; Leinss, S; Huss, M; Haemmig, C; Hajnsek, I				Round, Vanessa; Leinss, Silvan; Huss, Matthias; Haemmig, Christoph; Hajnsek, Irena			Surge dynamics and lake outbursts of Kyagar Glacier, Karakoram	CRYOSPHERE												The recent surge cycle of Kyagar Glacier, in the Chinese Karakoram, caused formation of an ice-dammed lake and subsequent glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) exceeding 40 million m(3) in 2015 and 2016. GLOFs from Kyagar Glacier reached double this size in 2002 and earlier, but the role of glacier surging in GLOF formation was previously unrecognised. We present an integrative analysis of the glacier surge dynamics from 2011 to 2016, assessing surge mechanisms and evaluating the surge cycle impact on GLOFs. Over 80 glacier surface velocity fields were created from TanDEM-X (TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement), Sentinel-1A, and Landsat satellite data. Changes in ice thickness distribution were revealed by a time series of TanDEM-X elevation models. The analysis shows that, during a quiescence phase lasting at least 14 years, ice mass built up in a reservoir area at the top of the glacier tongue, and the terminus thinned by up to 100 m, but in the 2 years preceding the surge onset this pattern reversed. The surge initiated with the onset of the 2014 melt season, and in the following 15 months velocity evolved in a manner consistent with a hydrologically controlled surge mechanism. Dramatic accelerations coincided with melt seasons, winter deceleration was accompanied by subglacial drainage, and rapid surge termination occurred following the 2015 GLOF. Rapid basal motion during the surge is seemingly controlled by high water pressure, caused by input of surface water into either an inefficient subglacial drainage system or unstable subglacial till. The potential lake volume increased to more than 70 million m(3) by late 2016, as a result of over 60 m of thickening at the terminus. Lake formation and the evolution of the ice dam height should be carefully monitored through remote sensing to anticipate large GLOFs in the near future.					; Leinss, Silvan/AAV-5848-2021; Huss, Matthias/JLL-6340-2023; Round, Vanessa/C-1772-2019; Hajnsek, Irena/AAH-1504-2021	Huss, Matthias/0000-0002-2377-6923; Round, Vanessa/0000-0001-5392-5347; Hajnsek, Irena/0000-0002-0926-3283; Leinss, Silvan/0000-0002-4467-5793													1994-0416	1994-0424				MAR 21	2017	11	2					723	739		10.5194/tc-11-723-2017	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-723-2017													WOS:000398744700001
J	Lindén, E; Kuosa, H				Lindén, E; Kuosa, H			Effects of grazing and excretion by pelagic mysids (Mysis spp.) on the size structure and biomass of the phytoplankton community	HYDROBIOLOGIA					17th Baltic Marine Biologists Symposium	NOV 25-29, 2001	Stockholm, SWEDEN					The aim of this study was to determine the effects of pelagic mysids (Mysis mixta and M. relicta) on the biomass and size-structure of the phytoplankton community during the period following the spring bloom. Mysids excreted phosphate (4.5 +/- 0.7 nmol ind(-1) h(-1)) and ammonium (123.6 +/- 31.6 and 45.0 +/- 3.2 nmol ind(-1) h(-1)) and increased the total chlorophyll-a concentration of phytoplankton slightly. However, the presence of mysids affected different size-classes of phytoplankton differently. Mysids mainly grazed on large-sized (>10 mum) phytoplankton cells. Small-sized (<10 μm) algal cells avoided grazing, gained a competitive advantage and were able to utilize the nutrients excreted by mysids. According to this study, both top-down and bottom-up mechanisms simultaneously mould the structure of the phytoplankton community. A large zooplankton biomass might promote the increase of small flagellates by a combination of repleting nutrient stores, selective grazing on large algal cells and heavy predation on protozoa which, consequently, might have a cascading effect on the most favoured protozoan food source, small flagellates.

Magnetic concentration-dependent parameters [i.e. magnetic susceptibility (chi(lf)), anhysteretic susceptibility (chi(ARM)), and saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM)] and grain size-dependent parameters [i.e. percentage frequency-dependent susceptibility (chi(fd)%), SIRM/chi(lf), and chi(ARM)/chi(lf)] of core and catchment sediments were measured to characterize provenance and catchment processes. Multi-magnetic parameters revealed that the primary magnetic minerals in the peat samples were mainly detrital magnetic minerals, which originated from catchment surface soil erosion. Changes in vegetation coverage as well as pedogenesis induced by rainfall variation play an important role in controlling the input of magnetic materials. Therefore, we infer that variations of magnetic features in the core bear potential to elucidate the history of environmental changes in the past similar to 3000 years, which are closely related to Asian summer monsoon evolution. Multiple parameters revealed that in three periods (i.e. 2700-2500, 1600-1000, and 500-300 cal year BP), decreased pedogenesis intensity and increased erosion induced by decline in vegetation coverage under dry conditions led to increased input of magnetic minerals, especially the coarser minerals in peat samples. However, in the two periods (i.e. 2500-1600, and 1000-500 cal year BP), multi-magnetic proxies indicate increased pedogenesis and decreased input of magnetic minerals dominated by fine-grained magnetic minerals caused by increased vegetation coverage under relatively wet and warm conditions. These climatic periods are of broad regional consistence across the world. The general trend of the late Holocene climate revealed by magnetic parameters confirms the sensitivity of environmental magnetism in this peat succession from the subalpine western Nanling Mountains to the climatic/environmental variability in the Asian summer monsoon region.					; Xue, Jibin/KTI-2699-2024; Wei, Zhiqiang/KDN-1700-2024; shang, shang/IYS-8177-2023	Xue, Jibin/0000-0003-1319-3377; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				OCT	2019	62	3					229	244		10.1007/s10933-019-00079-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-019-00079-z													WOS:000484934500001
J	Zolitschka, B				Zolitschka, B			Recent sedimentation in a high arctic lake, northern Ellesmere Island, Canada	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												A multiple core study was conducted on laminated minerogenic sediments from Lake C2, northern Ellesmere Island, Canadian High Arctic. Lateral persistence, distal thinning, variation in grain size of these laminations as well as present-day processes of highly seasonal sediment transfer into the lake basin suggest that elastic varves have been formed. Sedimentation rates based on Pb-210 dating agree well with sedimentation rates based on lamination counts giving further evidence that laminations are annual. Errors in varve counting were reduced from 12% to <2% using the multi-core approach of cross-correlating all records. Varved sediments are occasionally interrupted by thick coarse-grained layers, which are interpreted as deposits of turbidity currents and may be related to extremely high discharge events and slope failures of the delta front. Micro-laminated sediments spanning the last two centuries were studied in detail. Suspension settling is the dominant process of deposition depending upon stream discharge which is controlled by nival melt and summer temperatures. Application of varve chronology thus allows to use lamination thickness measurements as source of high resolution proxy data for palaeoclimatic reconstruction.

Reflection of the 8.2 ka BP event and the Greenlandian-Northgrippian boundary in a new high-resolution pollen record from the varved sediments of Lake Mondsee, Austria	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												This paper presents a new pollen record from Lake Mondsee in the north-eastern European Alps and discusses changes in vegetation composition between 9000 and 7000 a BP in response to the 8.2 ka BP cooling event, which is clearly reflected in a stable oxygen isotope record from the same lake. Pollen and microcharcoal analyses performed at bi-decadal resolution provide detailed insights into the vegetation history and fire regime in the study area. The late Greenlandian and early Northgrippian between ca. 9000 and 8000 a BP were mainly characterised by the gradual expansion of spruce, accompanied by the retreat of hazel. Results of the pollen-based biome reconstruction show that the Greenlandian-Northgrippian boundary at ca. 8280 a BP was marked by a shift in the affinity scores of regional forest biomes, reflecting a decreasing role of temperate broadleaved trees and shrubs and a strengthening of boreal conifers in the study area. During the early Northgrippian between ca. 8000 and 7000 a BP, fir and beech spread around Lake Mondsee, which is in line with other pollen records from the northern Alpine Foreland, indicating cooler and moister conditions. This long-term trend is likely a response to decreasing summer insolation (i.e. decreasing summer temperatures) and the weakening of the Siberian High, which promoted westerly-driven moisture transport from the Atlantic region. Visual inspection of the Lake Mondsee pollen data does not reveal a clear signal of the 8.2 ka BP event. However, biomization results show a distinct minimum in the temperate deciduous biome scores and summed scores of plant functional types representing warm-loving tree and shrub taxa at ca. 8165-8135 a BP.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

QUANTIFYING THE EFFECTS OF PHOTOREACTIVE DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER ON METHYLMERCURY PHOTODEMETHYLATION RATES IN FRESHWATERS	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The present study examined potential effects of seasonal variations in photoreactive dissolved organic matter (DOM) on methylmercury (MeHg) photodemethylation rates in freshwaters. A series of controlled experiments was carried out using natural and photochemically preconditioned DOM in water collected from 1 lake in June, August, and October. Natural DOM concentrations doubled between June and August (10.2-21.2 mg CL-1) and then remained stable into October (19.4 mg C L-1). Correspondingly, MeHg concentrations peaked in August (0.42 ng L-1), along with absorbances at 350 nm and 254 nm. Up to 70% of MeHg was photodemethylated in the short 48-h irradiation experiments, with June having significantly higher rates than the other sampling months (p < 0.001). Photodemethylation rate constants were not affected by photoreactive DOM, nor were they affected by initial MeHg concentrations (p > 0.10). However, MeHg photodemethylation efficiencies (quantified in moles MeHg lost/moles photon absorbed) were higher in treatments with less photoreactive DOM. Congruently, MeHg photodemethylation efficiencies also decreased over summer by up to 10 times across treatments in association with increased photoreactive DOM, and were negatively correlated with DOM concentration. These results suggest that an important driver of MeHg photodemethylation is the interplay between MeHg and DOM, with greater potential for photodemethylation in freshwaters with more photobleached DOM and lower DOM content.

J	SIMON, M				SIMON, M			BIOMASS AND PRODUCTION OF SMALL AND LARGE FREE-LIVING AND ATTACHED BACTERIA IN LAKE CONSTANCE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Cell numbers, biomass, and secondary production of small (0.2-1 .mu.m) and large (1.0-3.0 .mu.m) free-living and attached bacteria were studied in Lake Constance. Biomass as well as production rates exhibited large fluctuations vertically and seasonally. When averaged over a year, small-free-living bacteria were not most important for recycling of organic matter since they comprised 77% of total cell numbers and 66% of bacterial secondary production. Large free-living bacteria contained roughly half of the total bacterial biomass because of their relatively larger cell size. Although attached bacteria usually were of minor importance, they occasionally comprised about half of total bacterial production. During the phytoplankton spring bloom when bacterial production reached its maximum, 60-80% of all free-living bacteria were active as shown by autoradiography. During that period a high portion of detrital particles was colonized by metabolically active cells. The data suggest that biomass, cell size, and production of free-living bacteria are controlled by substrate input and grazing of either heterotrophic microflagellates or crustacean zooplankton. In contrast, biomass and production of attached bacteria appear to be predominantly controlled by substrate input of readily decomposable particulate organic matter.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	1987	32	3					591	607		10.4319/lo.1987.32.3.0591	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1987.32.3.0591													WOS:A1987J684100006

The aim of this work is to study the short-term ongoing erosive response to a rapid base-level drop in a small, steep-fronted, erodible fan-delta setting. The work explores the controls of the steep Qedem fan-delta, guided by its clinoform structure, on its incision. Longitudinal profiles of the fan-delta and of its entrenched channel were measured in the field. Sedimentary facies changes - fluviatile, shallow lacustrine and beach - were followed along exposures. The existence of large boulders provided an opportunity to examine the uncertain role of armouring and boulder flux on incision. The field study was combined with digital elevation models (DEMs) that were extracted from pairs of overlapping aerial photos. Maps of erosion and deposition were prepared using a change detection algorithm. The longitudinal profile of the entrenched channel was found to be steep and linear. The outlet temporarily 'hangs' elevated and ungraded above the retreating lake level, indicating years without incision flow events, which cause lags in response to the rapid lake level drop. In spite of the large boulders, the small drainage basin and precipitation volume over the basin of the Qedem, the recorded vertical incision rates in the unconsolidated sediments are as high as 0.8 m yr(-1), i.e. similar to those of the largest wadis draining to the Dead Sea. The steep front of the fan-delta is suggested to be a main factor controlling the efficient incision. A unique transport mechanism of rolling boulders, following undercutting, contributed to the entrenchment efficiency.

The paradox of "premature migration" by adult anadromous salmonid fishes: patterns and hypotheses	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												In several groups of anadromous fishes, but especially the salmonids, some populations migrate from the ocean to fresh water many months prior to spawning. This "premature migration" reduces growth opportunities at sea, compels them to occupy much less productive freshwater habitats, and exposes them to extremes of flow and temperature, disease, and predation. We first review migration in salmonids and find great variation in timing patterns among and within species, relative to the timing of reproduction. Premature migration is widely distributed among species but not in all populations, and we propose two hypotheses to explain it. First, the fish may be making "the best of a bad situation" by entering early because access to suitable breeding sites is constrained seasonally by flow or temperature regimes, so they sacrifice growing opportunities at sea. Alternatively or additionally, some populations may be "balancing risks and benefits" as they trade off the benefits of growth at sea against the risk of mortality there. In this model, the reduced risk of mortality at sea must be balanced against the risk of mortality in freshwater habitats from thermal stress, disease, and predators. Premature migration may be favored where temperatures and flows are moderate or where lakes provide safety from predators and reduce energetic expenditure. Consistent with this hypothesis, early return is characteristic of larger, older salmonids (that would benefit less from additional time at sea to grow than would smaller fish). Finally, we consider the vulnerability of premature migrants to climate change and selective fisheries. Migration timing is an important part of the portfolio of phenotypic diversity that conveys resilience to species, population complexes, and the fisheries that depend on them. The premature migrants are often especially valued in fisheries and also often of particular conservation concern, and the phenomenon merits further research.

These reservoirs represented a variety of trophic states and geographic provinces, and included three piedmont systems, two coastal plain systems and one each in the mountains and sandhills. The study reservoirs differed from northern temperate lakes in seasonal phytoplankton taxonomic patterns, the dominance of flagellated chrysophytes and cryptomonads, lack of spring diatom blooms and generally low abundance of blue-green algae, particularly in the larger systems. The small reservoirs were more susceptible to algal blooms, caused by nutrient trapping and elevated temperatures from thermal loading. Direct thermal discharge effects upon the phytoplankton communities were either localized or non-significant, depending upon site-specific circumstances. Indirect effects of thermal loading caused ecosystem-wide alterations both from top-down(fish) and bottom-up (phytoplankton) effects. In one acidic reservoir, power-plant operational changes reduced concentrations of water-column metals, with major concurrent alterations in phytoplankton taxonomic structure.																			0043-1354					MAR	1994	28	3					665	673		10.1016/0043-1354(94)90146-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(94)90146-5													WOS:A1994MW93800017

As a result, the vast number of thaw takes in this area are very sensitive to it changing climate. With thaw lakes prone to either increases in area due to thermokarst processes, or complete drainage in less than one day due to melting of channels through ice-rich permafrost. After a lake drains, it leaves a topographic basin that is often termed a Drained Thaw Lake Basin (DTLB). An analysis of aerial photographs and topographic maps showed that 41 lakes drained in the study area between 1950 and 2000, for a rate of slightly less than one lake per year. The rate of drainage over three time periods (1950-1973. 1973-1985, 1985-2000), decreased from over 1 lake/year to approximately 0.3 lake/year. The reason for this decrease is not known, but it is hypothesized that it is related to the effect of a warming climate. There is a large spatial variation in DTLBs, with higher number of drained lakes in physiographic areas with poor drainage. It is likely that this variation is related to variations in ground ice. Although previous Studies have suggested that lakes drain during periods of high water level, it is likely that a combination of it warm summer, a resulting deep active layer, and a moderately high lake level were responsible for the drainage of a lake in the study area during the summer of 1989. Although this study has documented changes in the rate of lake drainage over a 50-year period, there is a need for further research to better understand the complex interactions between climate, geomorphology, and hydrology responsible for this change, and to further consider the potential hazard rapid lake drainage poses to future industrial or resource development in the area.

Importance of Nest and Paternal Characteristics for Hatching Success in Fathead Minnow	COPEIA												We quantified the importance of nest and paternal characteristics for survival of eggs of Fathead Minnow, a multiple-batch spawner in which breeding males guard and tend nests. We stocked experimental ponds three weeks apart and then intensively monitored 150 nests. Nest predation by conspecifics accounted for most of the egg mortality, and 29% of all nests failed to produce hatchlings. Although egg survival was not affected by date of stocking or nest Initiation, hatching success improved In larger and longer-lasting nests. Nests where paternal care was observed during our monitoring were larger, lasted longer, and thus were more likely to produce hatchlings than nests where care-giving was not observed. Over one-third of the male caregivers displayed agonistic behaviors toward nest intruders, and this index of aggressive defense was also associated with improved nest performance. Larger males nested earlier and were more likely to be aggressive than smaller males. Post-spawning mortality of these larger, early-nesting males may facilitate a mid-summer demographic shift among breeders over the spawning season: nests of large, aggressive males are followed by those of smaller or later-maturing fish, who are more likely to survive to spawn again the following year.

J	Saarnisto, M				Saarnisto, Matti			Late Holocene land uplift/neotectonics on the island of Valamo (Valaam), Lake Ladoga, NW Russia	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The emergence of eight small lake basins from the Lake Ladoga basin waters in the Island of Valamo (Valaam), NW Russia was studied to work out the Late Holocene uplift history of the area. All eight small lake basins in the Island of Valamo (Valaam) emerged from Lake Ladoga when the water level fell 12 m in connection of the formation of River Neva, the current outlet of the lake. The consistent Valamo data is in harmony with the results from Kilpolansaari, north-western Lake Ladoga and show that River Neva originated 3100 C-14 BP, in corrected radiocarbon years at 3350 cal BP. Since the origin of River Neva, the island of Valamo has been uplifted 3-3.5 m more than the Neva threshold area at Porogi, as shown by the tilted transgression shoreline of Ladoga before the Neva was formed. One millimetre difference in annual uplift during the past 3000 years, which is the difference in the current uplift rate, explains this height difference, suggesting passive neotectonics in the area during the Late Holocene. This result conflicts with Russian geodetic measurements showing anomalously high uplift rates, up to 6.4 mm/y, in the north-east Ladoga area, where uplift values are 1-2 mm/y according to Fennoscandian isobase maps. The above land uplift anomaly within Precambrian shield terrain far from the uplift centre around the Gulf of Bothnia would be difficult to explain. The isobase maps of present-day Fennoscandian uplift indicate a highly regular dome-shaped uplift pattern with no anomalies at a regional scale. The suggested anomalous Holocene uplift discoveries in the Gulf of Finland and southern Gulf of Bothnia areas are challenged, whereas strong palaeoseismicity resulting from rapid land uplift, immediately following deglaciation of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet, resulted in earthquakes, bedrock dislocations and massive rock falls, e.g. in the northern Lake Onega area and Lapland.

J	Vaughan, RG; Hungerford, JDG; Keller, W				Vaughan, R. Greg; Hungerford, Jefferson D. G.; Keller, William			A Newly Emerging Thermal Area in Yellowstone	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Yellowstone is a large restless caldera that contains many dynamic thermal areas that are the surface expression of the deeper magmatic system. In 2018, using a Landsat 8 nighttime thermal infrared image, we discovered the emergence of a new thermal area located near Tern Lake on the northeast margin of the Sour Creek dome. A high-spatial-resolution airborne visible image from August 2017 revealed a large (similar to 33,300 m(2)) area of recently fallen trees, mostly devoid of vegetation, with bright soil, similar to other nearby thermal areas. Field observations in August 2019 confirmed that this was a steam-heated, acid-sulfate thermal area, with an arc-shaped zone of hydrothermally altered soil and heated ground, with surface temperatures of 60-80 degrees C, several steaming fumaroles, and boiling temperatures (93 degrees C) just beneath the surface. Fallen trees in contact with warm ground were being carbonized, yet new trees were growing in some cooler areas. Observations of stressed or dying vegetation from archived satellite and airborne remote sensing data going back to 1994 indicated that this thermal area started emerging around 2000. It increased in size slowly until around 2005, when the radiative heat output started measurably increasing. From 2005 to 2012, it grew more rapidly; and from 2012 through 2019, the growth rate slowed and the heat output stabilized. We predict that this stabilizing trend will continue in the coming years. The initial formation of this new thermal area was not clearly linked to any distinct seismic or geodetic events, although the period of rapid growth partly coincided with a period of rapid local uplift, possibly suggesting a causative relationship. The identification of this emerging thermal area illustrates the importance of satellite thermal infrared imaging combined with high-spatial-resolution remote sensing data and field observations for mapping, measuring, and monitoring Yellowstone's thermal areas. It is also an example of the dynamics we expect to observe within large caldera systems like Yellowstone, where changes in the size and distribution of thermal areas are normal and do not indicate an impending eruption nor any significant changes in the broader magmatic system.																				2296-6463				JUN 23	2020	8								204	10.3389/feart.2020.00204	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2020.00204													WOS:000548656400001

Up to now generally only heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates have been quantitatively considered among limnetic protozooplankton. Our investigations using a special live-counting technique showed that large heterotrophic flagellates (LHF, greater-than-or-equal-to 15-mu-m; mainly chrysomonads and dinoflagellates) have been overlooked in quantitative estimations of limnetic protozooplankton biomass. We present estimations from 19 German lakes of different trophy during different seasons and from 4 rivers as well as detailed seasonal studies of a eutrophic lake and a brook indicating that LHF can form up to 50% (mean about one third) of protozooplankton biomass. LHF reached highest importance in early spring when LHF were one of the most significant herbivore groups. Large heterotrophic flagellates should be considered as significant components of limnetic food webs. This is in agreement with the present knowledge of marine pelagic ecosystems where LHF (mainly dinoflagellates) have already been recognized as an important part of the pelagic microbial web.

Patchy distribution of phyto- and zooplankton in large and shallow lagoon under ice cover and resulting trophic interactions	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The plankton of coastal lagoons while they are covered by ice is rarely studied. We hypothesised that, under ice: (1) the lack of wind mixing would lead to strong diversification in the spatial distribution of both phyto- and zooplankton communities across the lagoon; and (2) top-down regulation would be small, and would not significantly affect the development of phytoplankton. We tested these hypotheses in Vistula Lagoon (southern Baltic Sea) a few weeks after the thickness of the ice had reached 10 cm. Considerable horizontal and vertical spatial variation in some physical (turbidity, transparency) and chemical (Cl-, total N and total P) water properties were observed. According to a two-dimensional canonical correspondence analysis, these differences were related to the heterogeneous distribution of several plant and animal taxa, supporting our first hypothesis. The ratio of the total biomass of non-predatory zooplankton (B-Zp) to the biomass of edible phytoplankton <= 35 mu m (B-Ph) was low across the different sampling sites (mean 0.08; range 0.02-017), and differed across the lagoon. However, the significant correlation between B-Zp and B-Ph values (Spearman test,r = 0.70; P <= 0.05) suggests a considerable role of zooplankton filter feeders in controlling the development of phytoplankton. Therefore, top-down control may be quite strong, refuting Hypothesis 2.					; Kornijów, Ryszard/AEX-3635-2022; Wozniczka, Adam/MEK-8184-2025; Nawrocka, Lidia/KFA-0262-2024	Kornijow, Ryszard/0000-0001-8110-1310; Wozniczka, Adam/0000-0001-5050-9145; Magnuszewski, Artur/0000-0001-8697-3492; 													1323-1650	1448-6059					2020	71	10					1327	1341		10.1071/MF19259	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF19259													WOS:000571569900011

A total of 137 phytoplankton species belonging to 8 divisions were recorded indicating rich phytoplankton diversity in the North Indian reservoir. Bacillariophyta contributed the highest number of species followed by Chlorophyta. Filamentous algae such as Geitlerinema sp., Pseudoanabaena sp., Oscillatoria sp. and Phormidium sp. were highly abundant. The contribution of the top ten species ranged between 63% and 98% of total phytoplankton density. PCA analysis of physico-chemical revealed six principal components (HCO3, TDS, BOD, DOM, air temperature and pH) which significantly affected the succession of phytoplankton in Jargo Reservoir. The CCA analysis of phytoplankton species and physico-chemical parameters revealed that Ochrophyta and Miozoa were highly influenced by high CO2 and PO4. Higher phytoplankton diversity and species richness were observed during the late winter season and rainy season, respectively.

However, embedded reservoirs are rarely used in eutrophic shallow lakes because of their undetermined nutrient retention efficiency and unknown effects by the phytoplankton community. In this study, we aim to investigate the nutrient retention and algae succession in an embedded reservoir and adjacent wetland from April 2017 to September 2018 in the eastern part of Lake Taihu, China. More than 40% of total phosphorus (TP) and 45% of particulate phosphorous entering the reservoir were retained semiannually, and the highest TP removal efficiency was achieved in the reservoir during autumn with an average value of 53.3% +/- 9.9%. The overall nitrogen retention efficiency (21.7% +/- 37.8%) was lower than that of TP (41.8% +/- 27.8%). Similar trends were obtained in the wetland area. An important pathway for phosphorus removal is through particulate matter retention. Our study revealed that nutrient retention mechanisms in the reservoir were primarily via macrophyte absorption, particulate substance sedimentation, and prolonged water residence time. Consequently, the phytoplankton biomass (Chl-a) in the reservoir decreased (from 48.0 to 25.2 mu g/L) and water transparency improved, due to the decreased P level and transformation of the phytoplankton group into simple structures with good ecological status. Therefore, the combination of embedded reservoir and constructed wetland ecosystem can be used successfully to protect surface water. The results will be advantageous to groups seeking to preserve drinking water sources. (c) 2019 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The focus of this study was to identify and to remove sources of within-type variability of temperature. Within-type variability was considerable. Its source turned out to be a combination of climate change and small-scale circulation features that were present in the data but were not captured by the map pattern classification. These small-scale features, identified using composite difference maps for cold and warm days of each map type, consisted of height anomalies centered to the east of Lake Superior. Viewing these differences as anomalous components of the mean 700 hPa height pattern-which when added to or subtracted from the pattern create subtle but important modifications-provided insight into the differences in the shape of the 700 hPa steering current for different surface weather systems. To incorporate these features into the classification, daily relative vorticity patterns were computed and discriminant analysis was used to create cold, average, and warm subtypes for each of the first five map types. Replacing the first five map types by their subtypes in the regression models increased the explained variance by 20-30%. Collapsing warm and cold types did not increase the explained variance as much as it stabilized the models. The creation of cold and warm subtypes also removed a warming trend (significant for two of the map types) by translating the warming trend into a change in the frequency of the subtypes. The analysis used four different floating grids or windows. Classifications for windows centered east of the lake generated better results than those to the west.

However, most continental-scale river models have not focused on the reproduction of water level because the storage and movement of surface waters are regulated by smaller-scale topography than their grid resolutions. Here we analyzed the water level dynamics simulated by a state-of-the-art global river model, CaMa-Flood, with subgrid representation of floodplain topography. As a case study, hydrodynamics simulation in the Amazon River was accomplished, and the simulated water surface elevations along the main stem were compared against Envisat altimetry. The seasonal cycles of the simulated water surface elevations are in agreement with the altimetry (correlation coefficient >0.69, annual amplitude error <1.6 m). The accuracy of absolute water surface elevations was also good (averaged RMSE of 1.83 m), and the associated errors were within the range of the model uncertainty due to channel cross-section parameters. Then the ocean tide variation at river mouth was incorporated for simulating the tidal effect in the inland Amazon basin, which requires realistic representation of absolute water surface elevations. By applying power spectra analysis to the simulated water level variations, the 15 day cycle due to spring and neap tides was detected at Obidos, located 800 km upstream from the river mouth. The reproduction of the ocean tide propagation to the inland region suggests that CaMa-Flood includes the main physical processes needed to accurately simulate the water level dynamics in continental-scale rivers.

J	Matsuoka, N				Matsuoka, Norikazu			Climate and material controls on periglacial soil processes: Toward improving periglacial climate indicators	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												One of the distinguished efforts of A.L. Washburn was to reconstruct mean annual air temperature using periglacial features as climate indicators. This paper reviews existing periglacial indicators and proposes a strategy to improve their thermal resolution based on recent periglacial process studies, with a focus on solifluction and thermal contraction cracking and associated landforms/structures. Landforms resulting from solifluction reflect both the depth subjected to freeze-thaw and the thickness of frost-susceptible soils. The thickness of a solifluction structure can be used to infer the dominant freeze-thaw regime and minimum seasonal frost depth. Ice-wedge pseudomorphs have limited potential as a climate indicator because (1) they mainly reflect extreme winter temperatures, (2) their thermal thresholds depend on the host material, and (3) they need to be distinguished from frost wedges of other origin produced under different thermal and/or material conditions. Monitoring studies of currently active ice wedges suggest that ice-wedge cracking requires a combination of low temperature and large temperature gradients in the frozen active layer. Further field monitoring of periglacial processes and their controlling factors under various climate conditions and in various materials are needed, however, to improve the resolution of periglacial paleoclimate indicators.

J	Rutledge, JM; Chow-Fraser, P				Rutledge, Julia M.; Chow-Fraser, Patricia			Landscape characteristics driving spatial variation in total phosphorus and sediment loading from sub-watersheds of the Nottawasaga River, Ontario	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Eutrophication from agricultural runoff is a global problem, often resulting in formation of anoxic zones in receiving water bodies. The Nottawasaga River Watershed (NRW) is dominated by agricultural land-use, and drains into Nottawasaga Bay, Georgian Bay (Lake Huron). A fundamental feature of the NRW is the Minesing Wetlands, a Ramsar site and the largest inland wetland in southern Ontario. We used total phosphorus (TP) concentration-discharge relationships to estimate annual loading from six sub-watersheds and compared these against published models, which did not offer a way to account for the unique properties of the Minesing Wetlands. We developed predictive loading models specifically for the NRW to account for these characteristics, which accurately predict daily summer base-flow TP (r(2) = 0.76, p = < 0.0001) and total suspended solids (TSS; r(2) = 0.65, p = < 0.0001) loads for 11 subwatersheds using geomorphic and land-cover variables. Drainage area and % pasture land were the most significant predictive variables driving spatial variability in TP and TSS loading rates among subwatersheds. The positive relationship between TP and % wetland (r(2) = 0.22, p = 0.0063) also suggested that the Minesing Wetlands are a source of nutrients to the Nottawasaga River. Watershed geomorphology (e.g. slope) was a good predictor of land cover, and produced accurate loading estimates. This study is the first to offer a new approach to predict TP and TSS loading rates during the growing season using readily available geospatial data.																			0301-4797	1095-8630				MAR 15	2019	234						357	366		10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.12.114	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.12.114								30639859					WOS:000460195000038
J	Abell, PI; Hoelzmann, P				Abell, PI; Hoelzmann, P			Holocene palaeoclimates in northwestern Sudan: stable isotope studies on molluscs	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Gastropod shells and bulk sedimentary carbonate deposits found in palaeolake sediments in the presently hyperarid regions of NW Sudan provide proxy materials for the evaluation of the vastly different and wetter climatic conditions that prevailed for several thousand years in that region at the beginning of the Holocene. Oxygen and carbon stable isotope ratio measurements on these shells and carbonates suggest that the African Summer Monsoon provided extensive rainfall up to 800 km further north than at present, creating substantial lakes and refilling the deep aquifers of the region with isotopically depleted water up to 21 degreesN. Variations in stable isotope ratios, as one proceeds upwards through the sediments, indicate that the wettest phase occured about 9000 years B.P., and that a considerably drier period began after about 5600 years B.P., after which the record is obliterated by decreasing rainfall and subsequent deflation of the sediments. During the wet phase, large quantities of isotopically depleted (light) moisture - corroborating the convective origin of the rainfall - were brought to the Eastern Sahara by intensified monsoonal rains. Variations in the oxygen isotope ratios during the growth of individual shells demonstrate that considerable seasonality existed in yearly rainfall. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Rouwet, D; Chiodini, G; Ciuccarelli, C; Comastri, A; Costa, A				Rouwet, Dmitri; Chiodini, Giovanni; Ciuccarelli, Cecilia; Comastri, Alberto; Costa, Antonio			Lago Albano, the "anti-Nyos-type" lake: The past as a key for the future	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												On 21 August 1986 almost 1800 people were asphyxiated by a CO2 cloud violently released by Lake Nyos, Cameroon. Post-1986 monitoring of Lake Nyos revealed that CO2 steadily accumulates in bottom waters through recharge from soda-rich aquifers. The 1986 lake roll-over event triggered scientific research on volcanic lakes, creating "Nyos biased" interpretations: the search for dissolved CO2 in other lakes might have led to over interpretations regarding hazard assessment. In this study, a thorough review of the historical literature on Lago Albano over the past approx. 2800 years shows no clear evidence of Nyos-type bursts, contrary to previous ideas. In 1989 Lago Albano was affected by a large CO2 pulse, concomitant with a seismic swarm below Colli Albani volcano. Tracing back in historical literature, at least two similar anomalous degassing episodes occurred out of five seismic crises between 1829 and 1927. Partial temperature-and density-driven roll-over of the top-9 m of Lago Albano commonly releases accumulated CO2 each winter (Chiodini et al., 2012). This degassing dynamics avoids long-term CO2 accumulation in bottom waters, as is the case at permanently stratified lakes in the tropics, such as Lake Nyos. Here we show that Lago Albano is an "anti-Nyos-type lake: sudden recharge and regularly periodic release of CO2 (Lago Albano) vs. steady recharge and sudden release of CO2 (Lake Nyos). Despite past evidence of hazardous events, (1) the intensive well pumping from the Albano aquifer might lower lake level, and hence decrease the CO2 saturation pressure threshold, and (2) the absence of cold winters, hence avoiding yearly lake roll-over favoring CO2 accumulation at bottom layers, are modern factors that rise the need to revise hazard assessment and future monitoring strategies. Despite the fact that CO2 concentration in bottom waters was far from saturation conditions during the last survey (May 2010; Chiodini et al., 2012), making a limnic eruption highly unlikely, it is necessary to know the saturation state of CO2 in bottom waters and physical lake stability at any time, in order to be prepared for a next anomalous co-seismic CO2 degassing event of unknown quantity near Lago Albano.

Most of the poor communities collect water from isolated ponds for drinking and other domestic needs. This paper explores how the small pond ecosystems and associated livelihoods of the coastal communities are vulnerable and argues that the pond ecosystem can be a potential resource base for community based adaptation in the coastal regions of Bangladesh. A set of quantitative and qualitative tools were applied to 309 households across five villages. The study showed that 96% of the respondents are dependent on pond water for drinking. More than 50% households expressed that temperature, rainfall variations and salinity intrusion, directly and indirectly, affect the pond water. Physical parameter values of temperature, pH and salinity from the ponds showed changes across different seasons. Drinking water scarcity during pre-monsoon (March-May), winter (Dec-Feb), disaster and immediate post-disaster period among the communities is high. Salinity intrusion and surface runoff caused by excessive rainfall in short periods also cause deterioration in the quality of pond water. However, successful examples of pond water usage emerged through the discussions, especially during a post-disaster crisis, which strengthens the idea that ponds could be a resource base for community-based adaptation in the coast of Bangladesh.

J	Gallus, WA; Segal, M				Gallus, WA; Segal, M			Cold front acceleration over Lake Michigan	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												High-resolution Era Model simulations of a strong but relatively dry late winter surface cold front that occurred during the STORM-FEST project depicted a pronounced acceleration of the front during the afternoon hours over the southern end of Lake Michigan. In this note, the impact of the lake on the front is examined. Reduced lower atmosphere turbulence due to both thermal stabilization and diminished surface roughness acting on postfrontal northerly winds increased frontogenesis strongly over the lake. The enhanced frontal circulation increased the front speed so that a noticeable frontal bulge occurred over the southern end of Lake Michigan. Some observational evidence is available to support the simulated frontal acceleration.																			0882-8156					OCT	1999	14	5					771	781		10.1175/1520-0434(1999)014<0771:CFAOLM>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0434(1999)014<0771:CFAOLM>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000083324200013
J	Carrega, P; Michelot, N				Carrega, Pierre; Michelot, Nicolas			An overstanding disaster of meteorological origin on October 2, 2020, in the mountains of the Alpes-Maritimes	PHYSIO-GEO												The exceptional rains of October 2, 2020, which affected the mountains of the Alpes-Maritimes, in southeastern France, will remain marked in the annals of statistics, and particularly in the minds of the inhabitants of the high valleys of the Vesubie and Roya, especially by their catastrophic consequences. The risk is described here by the articulation of three components that are the hazard, susceptibility and vulnerability. The hazard, the initial component consisting of rainfall and the mechanisms that generated it, is remarkable. Indeed, several factors combined to produce very strong air ascents over this region: a particularly powerful cyclone for the season, affecting unstable air in low layers, air very rich in water vapor after its overflight of the Mediterranean still warm in this season, and the rare coincidence of a very strong pressure gradient and its isobars oriented south-north with a steep and high relief, for more than 24 hours. To the west of the Var River (Grasse Pre-Alps), the south to south-southwest flow collided perpendicularly with the first reliefs near the sea oriented west-east (1200-1800 m in altitude), resulting in heavy rainfall totals exceeding 200, even 300 mm in 24 hours at 20-25 km from the coast, due to the orographic barrier effect. To the east of the Var River, the topography, this time oriented southnorth, parallel to the low-level flow, led the latter far inland, with stormy winds forcing it to rise gradually but powerfully to the Mercantour ridge line (3000 m altitude). Cumulative rainfall measured reached 513 mm in 24 hours at Saint Martin-Vesubie and 663 mm (including 336 mm in 6 hours) at the Mesches lake (Roya watershed) 40 km from the coast, due to the guidance effect. Another originality is that the areas concerned are very extensive: it is estimated that about 2000 km(2) received more than 200 mm, causing water levels of 50 to nearly 100 million cubic meters depending on the catchment area. The return periods of such rainfall are out of the ordinary, especially for Saint-Martin-Vesubie where the 7300 years are exceeded according to an adjustment with a GUMBEL law, or 486 to 5276 years (depending on parameter k) with a distribution of Generalized Extreme Values (GEV) which proves to be better adapted. At Tende (town), the return period reaches 550 years according to GEV (800 years according to a GUMBEL law). The station of Breil-sur-Roya is less affected with a value less than 100 years, the most abundant rains having fallen upstream. Huge volumes of water were able to infiltrate and run off, in proportions and at very variable speeds depending on the behavior of the raindrops on the surface of the ground, which is determined by the second component of the risk: susceptibility, the potential for the production of floods and ground movements following heavy rainfall. This generated phenomena of varying magnitude depending on the watersheds, depending on several parameters that distinguish, as their extent, pedology, lithology, or topography and slopes without forgetting the rate of vegetation cover. It is the combination of these parameters that made the flood generated more or less important and fast. At high altitudes, the steep slopes and the rather impermeable and bare ground allowed for the generation of vigorous runoff leading to an innumerable number of landslides and gullies on the sides of the valleys. These have fed the rivers and streams in fury with solid materials of all sizes, creating muddy devastating flows. If the floods have sometimes undermined entire sections of the riverbanks, they have also contributed to locally filling in the riverbed by raising it by several meters in some places. The combination of hazard and susceptibility has caused a major risk in terms of the vulnerability of the valley bottoms. Indeed, the stakes are high because they concentrate communication routes and populations often residing along the rivers, even in their major beds in some places. The alluvial or fluvioglacial soils, without cohesion, have been cleared by these floods with the houses and infrastructures that were there. The human and socio-economic toll is very high: nearly 20 deaths, traumatized populations, numerous buildings and houses totally destroyed or rendered uninhabitable, devastated and metamorphosed landscapes, dozens of bridges and kilometers of roads wiped out. By proposing an interpretation grid, the presentation of the intra- and inter-component articulation explains that this damage far exceeded that linked to the usual Mediterranean autumn floods (I. BARRET et al., 1994), as well as what could be imagined in reference to a secular collective memory. In spite of the human lives lost and the considerable material damage, the disaster could have been worse, if on the one hand the means of fight and immediate prevention had not been so well expressed, and on the other hand if there had not been a culture of risk, the degree of which is secularly rather high among the populations of these mountain valleys, compared to the city dwellers of the Cote d'Azur coast.																			1958-573X						2021	16								12370	10.4000/physio-geo.12370	http://dx.doi.org/10.4000/physio-geo.12370													WOS:000661355300006
J	King, J; Cambray, JA; Impson, ND				King, J; Cambray, JA; Impson, ND			Linked effects of dam-released floods and water temperature on spawning of the Clanwilliam yellowfish Barbus capensis	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In South Africa, modified flow regimes designed to maintain ecosystem functioning at some pre-determined level are recommended for all rivers involved in major water-resource developments. One component of such flow regimes of special interest in the winter-rainfall region of the country is the small pulses of higher flow that occur in the dry season (November-April), here called freshes. Research was carried out in the Olifants River, in the winter-rainfall region of South Africa, on the link between freshes and spawning of an endemic, vulnerable cyprinid, the Clanwilliam yellowfish Barbus capensis. Experimental releases from Clanwilliam Dam on the Olifants River in a previous year showed that a greater than usual spawning success, assessed by larval recruitment levels, was correlated with hypolimnetic freshes released during the species' breeding season (October-January). In the study reported on here, a hypolimnetic fresh of the same size, duration and timing as those linked with successful spawning failed to induce spawning. Differences in the thermal regime of water releases appeared to be responsible. Two warm (19-21 degrees C), epilimnetic freshes of 15 hours duration were then released, and correlated with fish moving onto the spawn beds and exhibiting pre-spawning behaviour. However, the fish moved downstream away from the spawn beds when cold (16-18 degrees C) hypolimnetic baseflows were released for 15 hours between the two epilimnetic freshes and continually after the second one. The presence of free embryos and larval B. capensis indicated, from their developmental stages, that spawning had probably occurred before the experimental releases began, when warm (21-23 degrees C) epilimnetic water was spilling over the dam, and had halted once spillage stopped and hypolimnetic releases began. Indeed, the presence of dead and deformed young suggested that the cold water may have had a detrimental affect on those spawned during the earlier warmer spell. A summary table details the conditions, including the hydraulic characteristics of the spawn beds, believed to induce spawning and support early life stages of B. capensis. It is concluded that freshes released from Clanwilliam Dam at the appropriate time (October-January) should be able to increase spawning success of B. capensis, but only if the water temperature at the spawn site is at or above 19 degrees C and stable or rising. However, successful spawning will not necessarily lead to high recruitment if water temperatures are not then maintained at appropriate levels for some time for development of the embryos and larvae. This implies that additional epilimnetic releases will be required following critical trigger flows.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1998	384						245	265		10.1023/A:1003481524320	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003481524320													WOS:000078947900015

It is based on a specific sedimentological approach that combines data from five sediment profiles sampled in distinct locations in the littoral zone. On a millennial scale, the lake-level record shows two successive periods from 11,700 to 4500 cal yr BP and from 4500 cal yr BP to the present, characterized by lower and higher average lake levels, respectively. In addition to key seasonal and inter-hemispherical changes in insolation, the major hydrological change around 4500 cal yr BP may be related to a non-linear response of the climate system to orbitally-driven gradual decrease in insolation. The Ledro record questions the notion of an accentuated summer rain regime in the northern Mediterranean borderlands during the boreal insolation maximum. Moreover, the Ledro record highlights that the Holocene was punctuated by successive centennial-scale highstands. Correlations with the Preboreal oscillation and the 8.2 ka event, and comparison with the atmospheric C-14 residual record, suggest that short-lived lake-level fluctuations developed at Ledro in response to (1) final steps of the deglaciation in the North Atlantic area and (2) variations in solar activity.

The structural shifting of microbial food webs has important implications for the function of lake ecosystems. However, we continue to lack a clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying the complexity and stability of microbial food web structures. In this study, we investigated the diversity and structure of protist communities and bacterial communities by using DNA meta-barcoding to reveal the key factors affecting the complexity and stability of microbial food webs in subalpine lakes. Our analysis shows that significant seasonal variations occurred in protist taxonomic and functional communities (e.g., algivores, bacterivores, and phototrophs), which were mainly controlled by hydrological and nutrient parameters such as temperature, pH, and NH4+-N. Based on the network approach, the most complex food webs in the summer exhibited the lowest stability. We also found that the trophic interaction between bacterivorous protozoans and bacteria was the main factor significantly having influence on microbial food web complexity and stability (P < 0.01). Moreover, biotic factors (i.e., bacterivorous protozoan composition) were better predictors of the relative abundance of several bacteria (Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria) as prey than abiotic factors. Thus, these results suggest that predation is essential for the complexity and stability of the microbial food webs in lake ecosystems. Our findings suggest that understanding these complex interactions of microbial food webs is critical for ecosystem management and for predicting the ecological consequences of future climate changes in aquatic ecosystems.																				2165-0497				DEC	2023	11	6							e0241123	10.1128/spectrum.02411-23	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.02411-23		OCT 2023						37787559					WOS:001076678400001

Simulation of the impact of future changes in climate on the hydrology of Bow River headwater basins in the Canadian Rockies	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												This study diagnoses the impact of projected changes in climate and glacier cover on the hydrology of several natural flowing Bow River headwater basins in the Canadian Rockies: the Bow River at Lake Louise (-420.7 km2), the Pipestone River near Lake Louise (-304.2 km2), the Bow River at Banff (-2192.2 km2) all of which drain the high elevation, snowy, partially glaciated Central Range, and the Elbow River at Calgary (-1191.9 km2), which drains the drier Front Ranges and foothills, using models created using the modular, flexible, physically based Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling platform (CRHM). Hydrological models were constructed and parameterised in CRHM from local research results to include relevant streamflow generation processes for Canadian Rockies headwater basins, such as blowing snow, avalanching, snow interception and sublimation, energy budget snow and glacier melt, infiltration to frozen and unfrozen soils, hillslope sub-surface water redistribution, wetlands, lakes, evapotranspiration, groundwater flow, surface runoff and open channel flow. Surface layer outputs from Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulations for the current climate and for the late 21st century climate under a "business-as-usual" scenario, Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) at 4-km resolution, were used to force model simulations to examine the climate change impact. A projected glacier cover under a "business-as-usual" scenario (RCP8.5) was incorporated to assess the impact of concomitant glacier cover decline. Uncalibrated model simulations for the current climate and glacier coverage showed useful predictions of snow accumulation, snowmelt, and streamflow when compared to surface obser-vations from 2000 to 2015. Under the RCP8.5 climate change scenario, the basins of the Bow River at Banff and Elbow River at Calgary will warm up by 4.7 and 4.5 degrees C respectively and receive 12% to 15% more precipitation annually, with both basins experiencing a greater proportion of precipitation as rainfall. Peak snow accumulation in Bow River Basin will slightly rise by 3 mm, whilst it will drop by 20 mm in Elbow River Basin, and annual snowmelt volume will increase by 43 mm in Bow River Basin but decrease by 55 mm in Elbow River Basin. Snowcovered periods will decline by 37 and 46 days in Bow and Elbow river basins respectively due to sup-pressed snow redistribution by wind and gravity and earlier melt. The shorter snowcovered period and warmer, wetter climate will increase evapotranspiration and glacier melt, if the glaciers were held constant, and decrease sublimation, lake levels, soil moisture and groundwater levels. The hydrological responses of the basins will differ despite similar climate changes because of differing biophysical characteristics, climates and hydrological processes generating runoff. Climate change with concomitant glacier decline is predicted to increase the peak discharge and mean annual water yield by 12.23 m3 s-1 (+11%) and 11% in the higher elevation basins of the Bow River but will decrease the mean annual peak discharge by 3.58 m3 s-1 (-9%) and increase the mean annual water yield by 18% in the lower elevation basin of the Elbow River. This shows complex and compensatory hydrological process responses to climate change with the reduced glacier contribution reducing the impact of higher precipitation in high elevation headwaters and drier soil conditions and lower spring snowpacks reducing peak discharges despite increased precipitation during spring runoff in the Front Range and foothills headwaters under a warmer climate.					; Pomeroy, John W./A-8589-2013; Pomeroy, John/IZE-0873-2023	Fang, Xing/0000-0002-4333-4815; Pomeroy, John W./0000-0002-4782-7457; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				MAY	2023	620		B						129566	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129566	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129566		MAY 2023											WOS:001008384600001

Despite their critical role, our ability to predict their impacts under future climates is limited by a lack of data on SHW behaviour over centennial timescales. Here, we present a 700-year record of changes in SHW intensity from sub-Antarctic Marion Island using diatom and geochemical proxies and compare it with paleoclimate records and recent instrumental data. During cool periods, such as the Little Ice Age (c. 1400-1870 CE), the winds weakened and shifted towards the equator, and during warm periods they intensified and migrated poleward. These results imply that changes in the latitudinal temperature gradient drive century-scale SHW migrations, and that intensification of impacts can be anticipated in the coming century. Warmer periods correspond with poleward migration of the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds over the past 700 years and vice versa, according to multi-proxy records from a lake sediment core on sub-Antarctic Marion Island.					; Sime, Louise/AAX-7730-2021	Roberts, Stephen/0000-0003-3407-9127; Perren, Bianca/0000-0001-6089-6468; Vyverman, Wim/0000-0003-0850-2569; Sime, Louise/0000-0002-9093-7926														2662-4435				DEC 9	2020	1	1							58	10.1038/s43247-020-00059-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s43247-020-00059-6													WOS:000693644700001

J	Liu, YH; Hu, CY; Belshaw, NS				Liu, Yuhui; Hu, Chaoyong; Belshaw, Nicholas Stanley			Reconstruction of the East Asian Summer monsoon rainfall distribution at centennial scale during the Last Glacial Maximum	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), defined as the period between 23 and 19 ka, is considered a key climatic period with conditions in great contrast to the present. Study of this period may reveal aspects of global ice-sheet sensitivity to regional and global climate change which is critical in understanding climate teleconnections and feedback mechanisms. A stalagmite record from Linglong cave, Central China, in combination with other high-resolution stalagmite records from Southwest China and East China existing on the same moisture transport pathway allows a reconstruction of rainfall patterns during the LGM by making use of the delta O-18 differences between stalagmite records. The rainfall around both Southwest and Central East China show a prominent change centered at similar to 24 ka corresponding to the H2 event, one of the Heinrich events related to North Atlantic ice-rafting. Also, in Central East China around the periods at 22 and 20 ka, the rainfall is lower than the average during the whole LGM, while around 23, 21 and 19 ka the rainfall is higher than the average, which is opposite to the rainfall variation in Southwest China. This apparent dipole rainfall pattern during the LGM is similar to the modern East Asian Summer Monsoon ( EASM ) rainfall distribution observed during weak monsoon periods, suggesting a much weaker EASM with its front moving less far north during the LGM than at present, which may link to North Atlantic climate and shifting of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Power spectral analysis reveals that the rainfall variations in Southwest China are mainly controlled by a cycle of similar to 1000-yr, while in Central East China, it is mainly controlled by cycles of similar to 1800-yr and similar to 1300 yr, which are all possible solar activity cycles, suggesting that the EASM rainfall on long term scales is dominated by external forces.

Snow distribution over the Namco lake area of the Tibetan Plateau	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The mesoscale snow distribution over the Namco lake area of the Tibetan Plateau on October 2005 has been investigated in this paper. The base and revised experiments were conducted using the Weather Research Model (WRF) with three nested grids that included a 1 km finest grid centered on the Namco station. Our simulation ran from 6 October through to 10 October 2005, which was concurrent with long term meteorological observations. Evaluation against boundary layer meteorological tower measurements and flux observations showed that the model captured the observed 2 m temperature and 10 m winds reasonably well in the revised experiment. The results suggest that output snow depth maximum amounts from two simulated experiments were centered downwind of the Namco lakeshore. Modified surface state variable, for example, surface skin temperature on the lake help to increase simulated credibility.					; Ishikawa, Hirohiko/AAF-2725-2020	Ishikawa, Hirohiko/0000-0001-6009-4924; 													1027-5606	1607-7938					2009	13	11					2023	2030		10.5194/hess-13-2023-2009	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-13-2023-2009													WOS:000272232400001

The present study aims to investigate the occurrence, distribution, and chemical composition of MP pollution in Vesijarvi lake and Pikku Vesijarvi pond close to the city of Lahti (Finland) in winter. Sediment, snow, and ice core samples were collected near the shore of these two aquatic systems. MPs were analysed and identified by a non-destructive method using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) 2D imaging. The mean concentrations of MPs detected in sediment, snow, and ice samples were 395.5 +/- 90.7 MPs/kg, 117.1 +/- 18.4 MPs/L, and 7.8 +/- 1.2 MPs/L, respectively. FTIR results showed the predominant abundance of microplastics, such as polyamides (up to 53.3%), polyethylene and polypropylene (up to 17.1%), and natural fragments such as cellulose (up to 45.8%) and wool (up 18.8%) in the same size range. The potential release of MPs arising from stormwaters and sport and recreational activities was evidenced.

Extremophilic Exopolysaccharides: Biotechnologies and Wastewater Remediation	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Various microorganisms thrive under extreme environments, like hot springs, hydrothermal vents, deep marine ecosystems, hyperacid lakes, acid mine drainage, high UV exposure, and more. To survive against the deleterious effect of these extreme circumstances, they form a network of biofilm where exopolysaccharides (EPSs) comprise a substantial part. The EPSs are often polyanionic due to different functional groups in their structural backbone, including uronic acids, sulfated units, and phosphate groups. Altogether, these chemical groups provide EPSs with a negative charge allowing them to (a) act as ligands toward dissolved cations as well as trace, and toxic metals; (b) be tolerant to the presence of salts, surfactants, and alpha-hydroxyl acids; and (c) interface the solubilization of hydrocarbons. Owing to their unique structural and functional characteristics, EPSs are anticipated to be utilized industrially to remediation of metals, crude oil, and hydrocarbons from contaminated wastewaters, mines, and oil spills. The biotechnological advantages of extremophilic EPSs are more diverse than traditional biopolymers. The present review aims at discussing the mechanisms and strategies for using EPSs from extremophiles in industries and environment bioremediation. Additionally, the potential of EPSs as fascinating biomaterials to mediate biogenic nanoparticles synthesis and treat multicomponent water contaminants is discussed.					; Sarkar, Shrabana/NNH-0488-2025; Banerjee, Aparna/S-4196-2019; Cabrera, Gustavo/ABD-3960-2020; Cabrera, Gustavo/A-6578-2009; Bandopadhyay, Rajib/AAF-2306-2021	Banerjee, Aparna/0000-0002-5061-4903; SARKAR, SHRABANA/0000-0002-4187-4260; Cabrera, Gustavo/0000-0002-1850-0244; 														1664-302X				AUG 19	2021	12								721365	10.3389/fmicb.2021.721365	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.721365								34489911					WOS:000692786700001

Seasonal variations of phage life strategies and bacterial physiological states in three northern temperate lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												P>The current consensus concerning the prevalence of lytic and lysogenic phage life cycles in aquatic systems is that the host physiological state may influence viral strategies, lysogeny being favoured when hosts have reduced metabolic rates. We explored this hypothesis, by following phage cycle dynamics, host physiological state and metabolic activity over an annual cycle in three lakes subjected to strong seasonal fluctuations, including 4-5 months of ice cover. We observed marked seasonal dynamics of viral and bacterial communities, with low bulk and cell-specific bacterial metabolism in winter, and a dramatic increase in injured bacteria under the ice cover in all lakes. This period was accompanied by contrasting patterns in the proportion of lysogenic cells. In the eutrophic lake, times of low bacterial metabolic rates and high proportion of damaged cells corresponded to highest levels of lysogeny, supporting the notion that hosts are a 'refuge' for viruses. In the two unproductive lakes, peaks of injured cells corresponded to a minimum of lysogeny, suggesting an 'abandon the sinking ship' response, where the prophage replicates before the loss of genome. We suggest that these diverging responses to the host physiological state are not contradictory, but rather that there may be thresholds of cell stress and metabolic activity leading to one or the other response.					; Bouvier, Thierry/A-1895-2013; del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019; Maurice, Corinne/LTE-3808-2024	Maurice, Corinne/0000-0001-7187-3472; bouvier, thierry/0000-0002-7151-5680; Guillemette, Francois/0000-0003-2333-8410; del Giorgio, Paul/0000-0003-1866-8159; Comte, Jerome/0000-0002-7936-4290; 													1462-2912	1462-2920				MAR	2010	12	3					628	641		10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.02103.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.02103.x								20002137					WOS:000274942300007

The abundance of these picoplankton varied seasonally by about three orders of magnitude with one maximum of up to 10(6) cells ml-1. Bloom-forming picoplankton were isolated by dilution and further cultivated in liquid medium. Three clones were found to be representative species of the bloom. Using epifluorescence and electron microscopy as well as absorption and fluorescence emission spectroscopy, we examined these clones according to shape and pigment composition. They have ringlike thylakoids, are photosynthetically active and have no nuclear envelope. The cyanobacterial clones isolated represent three types containing phycobilisomes with either phycocyanin or phycoerthrin as the dominant accessory pigment. They are described here as three new species, two phycoerythrin-rich types and one phycocyanin-rich type, all of them belonging to the Synechococcus group. The differences found by fluorescence emission of isolated clones are discussed with respect to in situ strain identification.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				DEC 4	1992	248	2					93	103		10.1007/BF00006077	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006077													WOS:A1992KJ42000001

The most dominant cyanobacteria in Lake Blaarmeersen were Synechococcus (three genotypes), Limnothrix redekei and Anabaena/Aphanizomenon. Analyses of Similarity revealed that the cyanobacterial community in Lake Blaarmeersen differed significantly between the growing season and the winter season as well as between the epilimnion and hypolimnion during the stratified periods. Mantel tests revealed significant correlations between the DGGE data and bottom-up factors, physical variables, the phytoplankton community composition and, interestingly, the zooplankton community composition. In general, the zooplankton community composition (especially the cladoceran community) was more important in structuring the cyanobacterial community than the total zooplankton biomass. This study shows that grazing zooplankton communities can have a relatively strong impact on the cyanobacterial community dynamics and that this impact can be equally important as bottom-up processes regulated by nutrient concentrations and/or physical variables.

Throughout the year, the water column of the lake was divided into two layers (the mixolimnion extending down to 20 m depth and the monimolimnion) separated by a distinct, thin (about 2.0 m thick) chemocline. The chemical composition of the mixolimnion water was highly variable, the highest concentrations being shown by Ca, Na, Cl, SO4, and HCO3 ions. The same ions were also dominant in the monimolimnion, but their concentrations there were much higher and much less variable. The Czarnoglowy meromixis was found to be crenogenic. The lake received an inflow of groundwater from springs in the reservoir and the elevated mineralisation may have resulted from the inflow of groundwater seeping through the sedimentary limestone in the catchment. However, due to the limited data, these findings need further investigation.

Modeling subglacial water routing at Paakitsoq, W Greenland	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												The functioning of the Greenland Ice Sheet's subglacial drainage system and its effect on ice dynamics have been inferred largely from hypothetical hydrology dynamics models and from analysis of satellite data and in situ GPS measurements. Despite this, there is still uncertainty about how the surface hydrology interacts with the subglacial drainage system and affects basal water pressures and ice flow, especially over annual time scales. To address this, we developed a high spatial (100m) and temporal (1h) resolution, distributed, physically based, subglacial hydrological model, and applied it to the Paakitsoq region, western Greenland. The model is driven with moulin input hydrographs calculated by a surface routing and lake filling/draining model, forced ultimately with distributed hourly runoff calculated by a surface mass balance model. Key outputs from the model are spatially and temporally varying subglacial water pressures and proglacial stream hydrographs. Early in the melt season, short spikes in water pressure lasting less than a day occur as a result of lake drainage events. During midsummer, there are sustained periods of high water pressure lasting days to weeks, even at times when the subglacial system is inferred to be predominantly efficient. Later in the summer, large diurnal fluctuations in water pressure occur with peaks regularly exceeding ice overburden pressure superimposed on a gradually declining trend. These phenomena support the results of previous hypothetical modeling efforts and inferences drawn from GPS measurements.					; Banwell, Alison/W-8180-2018; Arnold, Neil/AAI-2272-2021	Willis, Ian/0000-0002-0750-7088; Banwell, Alison/0000-0001-9545-829X; 													2169-9003	2169-9011				SEP	2013	118	3					1282	1295		10.1002/jgrf.20093	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jgrf.20093													WOS:000325978500007

Climate amelioration after deglaciation allowed the expansion of shrubs and timber-line trees and the onset of plankton and probably lake summer stratification. This phase called Pre-Bolling has an upper boundary of approx. 16 kyrs BP. The change from a steppe to a tundra-like vegetation culminated during the following less temperate, humid phase, with lower in-lake productivity (Oldest Dryas, Ia; 16-13.6 kyrs BP). At about 13.6 kyrs BP when reforestation took place, summer surface water temperature increased towards recent temperatures and hypolimnetic anoxia developed. Different anoxic levels in respect to climate change underline the dynamic type of meromixis. Levels varied, being highest during the Preboreal/Boreal, and lowered during the Atlantic towards recent levels. The contrast between low trophic status and sediments enriched in organic matter characterizes "pseudeutrophic lake stratification" before the onset of human impact. Changes in the pelagic cladoceran communities during this time seem to be related to changes in predation. Aside long-term climatic change during the Atlantic, short-term fluctuations of precipitation within climate oscillations are suggested as possible causes of erosion processes, changes in lake level and water temperature. These are indicated for the Oldest and Younger Dryas, the Boreal/Atlantic and the Subboreal/Subatlantic transitions. They most likely act as the trigger mechanism for temporary mixing and changes in redox conditions. Extensive forest clearance in the catchment during Bronze-Age settlement caused a change in sediment type and temporary nutrient enrichment. The perturbations are comparable with erosion processes during the late-glacial when climate oscillations were the only driving forces. Anthropogenic influences on the lake environment vary according to land-use type.

J	Huang, Z; Li, SL; Li, JY; Zhang, C				Huang, Zhen; Li, Shuanglin; Li, Jianying; Zhang, Chao			The Combined Effects of the Tropical and Extratropical Quasi-biweekly Oscillations on the Record-setting Mei-yu Rainfall in the Summer of 2020	ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												During June-July 2020, the strongest recorded mei-yu rainfall occurred in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The rainfall processes exhibited an obvious quasi-biweekly (biweekly in brief) variability, and there are altogether five cycles. It is found that the biweekly rainfall cycle mainly arises from the collaborative effects of biweekly variabilities from both the tropics and extratropics. As for the tropics, the biweekly meridional march and retreat of the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) is particularly evident. As for the extratropics, geopotential height anomalies near Lake Baikal are active. The former is attributed to the intensified biweekly activity of the southwest-northeast oriented East-Asian Pacific wave train (EAP) originating from the tropical western Pacific, while the latter is associated with the biweekly activities of the eastward propagating Eurasia mid-high latitudinal wave train and the westward propagating North Pacific wave train. Why the biweekly activities of these wave trains intensified is further diagnosed from the perspective of thermodynamical forcing and also from the modulation of interannual background on intraseasonal variability. It is found that the strongest recorded convection anchoring over the tropical western Indian Ocean (IO) triggers anomalous descent over the tropical western Pacific, which modulates the biweekly activity of the EAP. Meanwhile, the anomalous diabatic heating over the IO causes changes of the meridional thermodynamic contrast across the IO to the high latitudes, which modulates the extratropical wave trains. A further diagnosis of barotropic kinetic energy conversion suggests that the active occurrence of two extratropical biweekly wave trains is attributed to the increased efficiency of energy conversion from basic flow. The westward propagation of the extratropical North Pacific wave train is attributed to the weakened and north-shifted upper-level westerly, which is caused by the SST warmth near the Kuroshio extension.

J	Maier, MA; Peterson, TD				Maier, Michelle A.; Peterson, Tawnya D.			Observations of a Diatom Chytrid Parasite in the Lower Columbia River	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												Often overlooked, zoosporic fungal parasites of phytoplankton ('chytrids') are present in aquatic systems worldwide. Although extensive studies in lakes give insight into potential impacts of chytrid epidemics on phytoplankton blooms and organic matter cycling, the ecological significance of chytrid infections of phytoplankton is still poorly understood in lotic systems. Here, we report the first observations of chytrid parasites attached to multiple diatom species in the lower Columbia River. We isolated a chytrid parasite of the dominant spring bloom diatom, Asterionella formosa, and sequenced DNA from several regions within the ribosomal RNA gene. We also investigated the specificity of the A. formosa chytrid to host and non-host diatoms with isolated cultures and found no cross infection at the species level. In the Columbia River, alterations in the hydrograph following the installation of hydroelectric dams may have opened a niche for chytrid parasites. Greater retention times may allow diatoms to bloom and provide a prolonged interaction period whereby chytrid parasites are able to infect hosts. Future research is needed to assess the seasonality and severity of chytrid infections on diatoms in the lower Columbia River and to evaluate the potential role of zoosporic fungi in influencing the food web structure and biogeochemical cycling in river systems.																			0029-344X	2161-9859				OCT	2014	88	3					234	245		10.3955/046.088.0306	http://dx.doi.org/10.3955/046.088.0306													WOS:000344487100005
J	Packard, GC; Lang, JW; Lohmiller, LD; Packard, MJ				Packard, GC; Lang, JW; Lohmiller, LD; Packard, MJ			Cold tolerance in hatchling painted turtles (Chrysemys picta): Supercooling or tolerance for freezing?	PHYSIOLOGICAL ZOOLOGY												We studied tolerance for cold in hatchling painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) from Lake Metigoshe, Bottineau County, North Dakota, to determine whether neonates in populations near the northern limit of distribution rely on a tolerance for freezing or on a capacity for supercooling to survive their first winter of life. We placed hatchlings individually into artificial hibernacula constructed in jars of damp, loamy sand and then cooled the jars to approximately -0.45 degrees C, which was below the equilibrium freezing point for water held by the sand but above that for body fluids of the neonatal turtles. A piece of ice next was placed on the surface of the sand in each jar to induce freezing of the soil water. After the soil water had frozen to an equilibrium, the temperature in the jars was lowered by 1 degrees C/d to minima averaging -2.5 degrees C, -4.5 degrees C, -6.5 degrees C, and -10.5 degrees C in different treatments. These temperatures were maintained for varying periods, so that animals in each treatment were exposed to temperatures below the equilibrium freezing point for their body fluids for a total of 11 d. Thirty of 32 hatchlings survived exposure to -2.5 degrees C; 24 of 32 survived at -4.5 degrees C; 14 of 32 withstood -6.5 degrees C; and 7 of 32 tolerated -10.5 degrees C. Freezing exotherms were detected in temperature profiles for turtles that succumbed but not in those for hatchlings that survived. Thus, the ability of hatchlings to withstand subzero temperatures for extended periods apparently requires that they avoid freezing. Although other workers contend that tolerance for freezing is the key to survival over winter by hatchling painted turtles from the region of Lake Metigoshe, our findings indicate that neonates rely primarily on their ability to remain unfrozen and supercooled.																			0031-935X					NOV-DEC	1997	70	6					670	678		10.1086/515875	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/515875								9361141					WOS:A1997YF04000009

F.; Creed, Irena F.; Jonsson, Anders; Bergstrom, Ann-Kristin			Trade-offs Between Light and Nutrient Availability Across Gradients of Dissolved Organic Carbon Lead to Spatially and Temporally Variable Responses of Lake Phytoplankton Biomass to Browning	ECOSYSTEMS												Northern lakes are experiencing widespread increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) that are likely to lead to changes in pelagic phytoplankton biomass. Pelagic phytoplankton biomass responds to trade-offs between light and nutrient availability. However, the influence of DOC light absorbing properties and carbon-nutrient stoichiometry on phytoplankton biomass across seasonal or spatial gradients has not been assessed. Here, we analyzed data from almost 5000 lakes to examine how the carbon-phytoplankton biomass relationship is influenced by seasonal changes in light availability, DOC light absorbing properties (carbon-specific visual absorbance, SVA(420)), and DOC-nutrient [total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP)] stoichiometry, using TOC as a proxy for DOC. We found evidence for trade-offs between light and nutrient availability in the relationship between DOC and phytoplankton biomass [chlorophyll (chl)-a], with the shape of the relationship varying with season. A clear unimodal relationship was found only in the fall, particularly in the subsets of lakes with the highest TOC:TP. Observed trends of increasing TOC:TP and decreasing TOC:TN suggest that the effects of future browning will be contingent on future changes in carbon-nutrient stoichiometry. If browning continues, phytoplankton biomass will likely increase in most northern lakes, with increases of up to 76% for a 1.7 mg L-1 increase in DOC expected in subarctic regions, where DOC, SVA(420), DOC:TN, and DOC:TP are all low. In boreal regions with higher DOC and higher SVA(420), and thus lower light availability, lakes may experience only moderate increases or even decreases in phytoplankton biomass with future browning.					; Creed, Irena/L-8810-2013	Isles, Peter/0000-0003-4446-6788; Creed, Irena/0000-0001-8199-1472													1432-9840	1435-0629				DEC	2021	24	8					1837	1852		10.1007/s10021-021-00619-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-021-00619-7		MAR 2021											WOS:000632792900004

Inorganic carbon fixation in ice-covered lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Inorganic carbon fixation, usually mediated by photosynthetic microorganisms, is considered to form the base of the food chain in aquatic ecosystems. In high-latitude lakes, lack of sunlight owing to seasonal solar radiation limits the activity of photosynthetic plankton during the polar winter, causing respiration-driven demand for carbon to exceed supply. Here, we show that inorganic carbon fixation in the dark, driven by organisms that gain energy from chemical reactions rather than sunlight (chemolithoautotrophs), provides a significant influx of fixed carbon to two permanently ice-covered lakes (Fryxell and East Bonney). Fryxell, which has higher biomass per unit volume of water, had higher rates of inorganic dark carbon fixation by chemolithoautotrophs than East Bonney (trophogenic zone average 1.0 mu g C l(-1) d(-1) vs 0.08 mu g C l(-1) d(-1), respectively). This contribution from dark carbon fixation was partly due to the activity of ammonia oxidizers, which are present in both lakes. Despite the potential importance of new carbon input by chemolithoautotrophic activity, both lakes remain net heterotrophic, with respiratory demand for carbon exceeding supply. Dark carbon fixation increased the ratio of new carbon supply to respiratory demand from 0.16 to 0.47 in Fryxell, and from 0.14 to 0.22 in East Bonney.

Given the key role of phosphorus (P) in eutrophication process, one of the effective restoration methods especially for small shallow lakes is removal of sediments enriched with nutrients. In our study, we used interannual, seasonal, and spatial data to examine the changes in sediment P mobility after removal of sediments in 2016 froma 1-ha highly eutrophic lake. Wemeasured the sediment redox potential, analyzed soluble reactive P (SRP) in the pore water and P fractional composition of the surface sediments, and calculated the diffusive flux of P in three locations in two continuous years (2017 and 2018) after the excavation. Similar measurements were done before sediment removal at central site of the lake in 2015. Removing nutrient-rich sediment also removed 6400 kg of P, and thus the potential for release of P from sediments decreased on a long-term scale. However, a large pool of releasable Pwas rebuilt soon after the sediment removal due to high external P loading, resulting in extensive anoxia of sediment surface and associated internal P loading as high as 1450 mg m(-2) summer(-1). Moreover, the Fe-P and labile P fractions were the most important sources of P release, as evidenced by their considerable seasonal and interannual changes after the sediment removal. The sediment total Fe negatively correlated with diffusive flux of P, porewater SRP, and near-bottomwater total P and SRP concentrationswhich indicated a strong linkage between sediment P dynamics and Fe after the restoration. Sediment removal could be a beneficial restoration approach, but the effects on lakewater quality remain only short-termunless there is an adequate control on external loading to the lake.

Understanding the process of phytoplankton variation can be particularly useful in water quality improvement and management decision. In this study, phytoplankton taxonomic composition, temporal and spatial distribution, and diversity along with limnological abiotic characteristics were studied based on monthly sampling from four sampling stations (between May 2005 and April 2006). A total of 4 classes, 68 genera, and 98 species which belong to Chlorophyceae (52 species), Cyanobacteria (24 species), Bacillariophyceae (19 species), and Euglenophyceae (3 species), respectively, were identified. Phytoplankton assemblages were dominated by Cyanobacteria during summer months and were the most abundant. On an annual average scale, the phytoplankton density varied between 0.24x1(0)4 units/ l at station 4 to 0.46x10(4) units/l at station 2, and station 2 represented highest population density.

These changes can be influenced by both human activities and internal climate variability(2,3). Although climate projections indicate a future widespread wetting trend over HMA(1,4), the timing and mechanism of the transition from a dipolar to a monopolar pattern remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that the observed dipolar precipitation change in HMA during summer is primarily driven by westerly- and monsoon-associated precipitation patterns. The weakening of the Asian westerly jet, caused by the uneven emission of anthropogenic aerosols, favoured a dipolar precipitation trend from 1951 to 2020. Moreover, the phase transition of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation induces an out-of-phase precipitation change between the core region of the South Asian monsoon and southeastern HMA. Under medium- or high-emission scenarios, corresponding to a global warming of 0.6-1.1 degrees C compared with the present, the dipolar pattern is projected to shift to a monopolar wetting trend in the 2040s. This shift in precipitation patterns is mainly attributed to the intensified jet stream resulting from reduced emissions of anthropogenic aerosols. These findings underscore the importance of considering the impact of aerosol emission reduction in future social planning by policymakers.					; Chen, Ziming/JZD-3965-2024; ZHOU, Tianjun/C-3195-2012; Chen, Xiaolong/AAO-7147-2020; Song, Fengfei/L-8239-2015; Li, Hongmei/L-2204-2015; Li, Hongmei/I-5025-2016; Jiang, Jie/Y-8371-2019; Zhang, Wenxia/L-8394-2015; Li, Chao/L-1915-2015	Chen, Xiaolong/0000-0003-4098-9952; ZHOU, Tianjun/0000-0002-5829-7279; JIANG, Jie/0000-0002-2095-4667; Song, Fengfei/0000-0002-3004-1749; Li, Hongmei/0000-0003-2912-1837; Zhang, Wenxia/0000-0001-8614-8070; Li, Chao/0000-0003-2556-0891; Chen, Ziming/0000-0001-7522-5093													0028-0836	1476-4687				NOV 16	2023	623	7987					544	+		10.1038/s41586-023-06619-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06619-y								37821703					WOS:001169056000016
J	HARE, L				HARE, L			SEDIMENT COLONIZATION BY LITTORAL AND PROFUNDAL INSECTS	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												The colonization rates of insects onto disturbed animal-free sediment were measured at profundal and littoral stations in a Canadian Shield lake. Sediments were exposed in containers to potential colonizers for up to one month in the early autumn. Most of the colonizing taxa at both stations were larvae of Chironomidae (Diptera). A simple model provided a reasonable fit to the colonization dynamics of many of these tara. The colonization rates of profundal chironomids were very slow or negligible, and densities on the introduced sediments remained far below those on surrounding sediments at the end of the experiment. Larvae of the phantom midge Chaoborus punctipennis colonized profundal sediments rapidly as a consequence of their diel vertical migrations between the water column and the sediments. Littoral taxa varied widely in the rate at which they colonized the sediments; some taxa reached densities measured on surrounding, non-disturbed sediments within a few weeks. Species living on the sediment surface appeared to colonize the containers most rapidly. The colonization rate of a taxon was directly related to its abundance in the surroundings. Estimated apparent steady state densities of colonizing taxa were either equivalent to or higher than densities on surrounding sediments.																			0887-3593					JUN	1995	14	2					315	323		10.2307/1467783	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1467783													WOS:A1995RB46600009

To address this need, a population-based telephone survey of 10,942 Canadians was conducted between 2014 and 2015, assessing Canadian's drinking water sources and recreational water exposures using a seven-day recall method. Results were analyzed by province/territory, season, age group, gender, income, education, and urban/rural status. Store-bought bottled water was reported by nearly 20% of survey respondents as their primary drinking water source, while approximately 11% of respondents reported private well. The proportion of private well users was significantly greater than the national average in the Maritime Provinces where approximately 40-56% of respondents reported this as their primary drinking water source. As expected, Canadians' recreational water activities and exposures (e.g., swimming, pool, lake, and waterpark) peaked during summer and were most commonly reported among children aged 0-9 years. Waterborne disease in Canada requires a multi-faceted public health approach. Canadian baseline data on water exposures can inform policy and public health strategies (e.g., recreational water guidelines, private well water testing recommendations) and support research and risk assessment related to mitigating waterborne illness.																			1477-8920					APR	2018	16	2					197	211		10.2166/wh.2018.261	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wh.2018.261								29676756					WOS:000430481200003
J	Sahlberg, J				Sahlberg, J			Physical modelling of the Akkajaure reservoir	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												This paper describes the seasonal temperature development in the Akkajaure reservoir. one of the largest Swedish reservoirs. It lies in the headwaters of the river Lulealven in northern Sweden: it is 60 km long and 5 km wide with a maximum depth of 92 m. The maximum allowed variation in surface water level is 30 m. The temperature field in the reservoir is important for many biochemical processes. A one-dimensional lake model of the Akkajaure reservoir is developed from a lake model by Sahlberg (1983 and 1988). The dynamic eddy viscosity is calculated by a two equation turbulence model, a k-epsilon model and the hypolimnic eddy diffusivity formulation which is a function of the stability frequency (Hondzo et al., 1993). A comparison between calculated and measured temperature profiles showed a maximum discrepancy of 0.5-1.0degreesC over the period 1999-2002. Except for a few days in summer, the water temperature is vertically homogeneous. Over that period of years, a weak stratification of temperature occurred on only one to two weeks a year on different dates in July and August. This will have biological consequences.																			1027-5606	1607-7938				JUN	2003	7	3					268	282		10.5194/hess-7-268-2003	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-7-268-2003													WOS:000188007700002

Phylogenetic relations of the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium baicalense from Lake Baikal	CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												Freshwater dinoflagellates still remain poorly studied by modern biological methods. This lack of knowledge prevents us from understanding the evolution and colonization patterns of these ecologically important protists. Gymnodinium baicalense is the most abundant, and possibly endemic, planktonic dinoflagellate from the ancient Lake Baikal. This dinoflagellate species blooms in the spring under the ice. This study analyzed the origin of this Baikalian dinoflagellate using three markers (two ribosomal and one mitochondrial DNA). It was found that this species is a true member of the order Gymnodiniales and has close relatives in the glacial melt waters of the Arctic Ocean. It seems that G. baicalense has diversified relatively recently from the arctic marine gymnodinioids. These results shed light on dinoflagellate biogeography and their colonizations in Lake Baikala biodiversity hotspot.

Fresh, oxygenated waters of the epilmnion overlie saline, deoxygenated waters of the hypolimnion. During winter, water from the Upper Hollyford River interflows along the pycnocline, depositing coarse silt on the steep delta and transporting finer sediment down-lake. An extensive sub-lacustrine channel system on the foreset delta slope is possibly maintained by turbidity currents. Saline waters of the hypolimnion are periodically replenished. During high tides and low lake levels saline water flows into the lake and downslope into the lake basin as a density current in a well defined channel.																			0272-7714	1096-0015					1981	12	1					23	37		10.1016/S0302-3524(81)80115-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0302-3524(81)80115-6													WOS:A1981LL75000003

G.; Mueller, Wolfgang			ESR and U-series analyses of faunal material from Cuddie Springs, NSW, Australia: implications for the timing of the extinction of the Australian megafauna	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The timing and cause of late Pleistocene faunal extinctions in Australia are subjects of a debate that has become polarised by two vigorously defended views. One contends that the late Pleistocene extinction was a short event caused by humans colonising the Australian continent, whereas the other promotes a gradual demise of the fauna, over a period of at least 10-20 ka, due to a combination of climatic changes and ecological pressures by humans. Cuddie Springs is central to this debate as it is the only site known in continental Australia where archaeological and megafauna remains co-occur. We have analysed more than 60 bones and teeth from the site by laser ablation ICP-MS to determine U, and Th concentrations and distributions, and those with sufficiently high U concentrations were analysed for U-series isotopes. Twenty-nine teeth were analysed by ESR. These new results, as well as previously published geochronological data, contradict the hypothesis that the clastic sediments of Stratigraphic Unit 6 (SU6) are in primary context with the faunal, archaeological and other materials found in SU6, and that all have ages consistent with the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) estimates of 30-36 ka. These young OSL results were used to argue for a relatively recent age of the extinct fauna. Our results imply that SU6 is either significantly older than the OSL results, or that a large fraction of the faunal material and the charcoal found in SU6 was derived from older, lateral deposits. Our U and Th laser ablation ICPMS results as well as the REE profiles reported by Trueman et al. [2008. Comparing rates of recystallisation and the potential for preservation of biomolecules from the distribution of trace elements in fossil bones. C.R. Palevol. General Paleontology (Taphonomy and Fossilization) 7,145-158] contradict the interpretation of previously reported rare earth element compositions of bones, and the argument based thereon for the primary context of faunal material and clastic sediments in SU6 layers.

The roles of season, habitat, host age and sex on parasite load were analyzed. Host sex had no effect on the 3 groups of parasites. The abundance of parasites increased with host age (P < 0.001). A marked seasonal effect was noted for all 3 groups of parasites (P < 0.001), all 3 being most abundant during the summer period. A eutrophic habitat, West Lake, was significantly more favorable (P < 0.001) for all 3 parasitic groups.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1978	56	6					1247	1250		10.1139/z78-178	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z78-178													WOS:A1978FG80100007

The model is rearranged and expressed as a P loading plot which agrees closely with the predictions of Vollenweider''s model. The model can be used to gain insight into the P loading concept. The primary conclusion is that a lake''s tolerance to P loading is a function of 2 processes: sedimentation and flushing rate. At low areal water loads, flushing of P through the lake''s outlet is the factor governing eutrophication. The importance of the steady state assumption is demonstrated by using data for Lake Washington [Washington, USA].

Evidence of persistent, recurring summertime hypoxia in Green Bay, Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Six years (2009-2015) of temperature and dissolved oxygen profile data show hypoxic conditions are common in the bottom waters of southern Green Bay, Lake Michigan during the summer. Depleted oxygen concentrations (<5 mg L-1) affect nearly 70% of the 38 stations sampled representing an area of similar to 500-600 km(2). Stratification typically lasts 2+ months, from late June to early September, and some stations exhibit bottom water hypoxia (<2 mg L-1) at a frequency of nearly 25% when sampled during this period. A monitoring program initiated in 1986 by the Green Bay Metropolitan Sewerage District has provided a 23 year, recreational season record (May-September) of continuous (15 min interval) in situ bottom water oxygen and temperature measurements at the Entrance Light station of the Green Bay navigational channel. The duration of the hypoxic season ranges from 2 weeks to over 3 months at this shallow 7 m offshore site. This variability likely results from a combination of thermal stratification, oxygen consumption in deeper waters of the bay, and physical forcing mechanisms that drive cool, oxygen depleted, bottom waters on a southerly trajectory across this sensor. These data suggest the duration of hypoxic conditions may have increased during the stratified season in recent years. Hypoxia in the bay would also appear to be sensitive to relatively small changes in these forces, particularly changes in organic carbon loading and the duration of stratification.

The propagating wave may be highly destructive for hydraulic structures, civil infrastructure and people living along the shorelines. A facility to study this phenomenon was set up in the laboratory of the Technical University of Catalonia. The set-up consists of a new device releasing granular material at high velocity into a wave basin. A system employing laser sheets, high-speed and high-definition cameras was designed to accurately measure the high velocity and geometry of the sliding mass as well as the produced water displacement in time and space. The analysis of experimental data helped to develop empirical relationships linking the landslide parameters with the produced wave amplitude, propagation features and energy, which are useful tools for the hazard assessment. The empirical relationships were successfully tested in the case of the 2007 event that occurred in Chehalis Lake (Canada).

Environmental controls of C, N and P biogeochemistry in peatland pools	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Pools are common in northern peatlands but studies have seldom focused on their nutrient biogeochemistry, especially in relation to their morphological characteristics and through seasons. We determined the environmental characteristics controlling carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) biogeochemistry in pools and assessed their evolution over the course of the 2016 growing season in a subboreal ombrotrophic peatland of eastern Canada. We showed that water chemistry variations in 62 pools were significantly explained by depth (81.9%) and the surrounding vegetation type (14.8%), but not by pool area or shape. Shallow pools had larger dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations and lower pH than deep pools, while pools surrounded by coniferous trees had more recalcitrant DOC than pools where vegetation was dominated by mosses. The influence of depth on pool biogeochemistry was confirmed by the seasonal survey of pools of different sizes with 47.1% of the variation in pool water chemistry over time significantly explained. Of this, 67.3% was explained by the interaction between time and pool size and 32.7% by pool size alone. P concentrations were small in all pools all summer long and combined with high N:P ratios, are indicative of P-limitation. Our results show that pool biogeochemistry is influenced by internal processes and highlight the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of nutrient biogeochemistry in ombrotrophic peatlands.

To investigate the impact of phyto-and zooplankton on the sedimentation rate, we sampled the sedimenting material in Lake Stechlin. Sedimenting matter was collected using a high-resolution multi-trap in three-day intervals during the thermally stratified seasons in 2011 (at 65 m depth) and 2012 (at 20 m depth). Dry weight of the sedimented material was related to chemical, physical, and biological data collected from the water column, as well as to meteorological data. The high-resolution trap showed two mass sedimentation peaks in 2011 and one in 2012. We found that diatom blooms in spring were followed by the highest sedimentation rate in 2011, but not in 2012. The sedimentation rates significantly correlated to low wind speed, followed by a rapid formation of the thermocline, as well as to high calcite concentrations in 2011. Our results suggest that the presence of some aggregation factors like calcite crystal exopolymers or fecal pellets support the sinking process. Furthermore, the high resolution of the trap used here allowed for obtaining precise correlations between sedimentation and the measured parameters indicating relevance of temporal coincidence of multiple environmental variables.

J	Michel, FA; Allen, DM; Grant, MB				Michel, FA; Allen, DM; Grant, MB			Hydrogeochemistry and geothermal characteristics of the White Lake Basin, South-central British Columbia, Canada	GEOTHERMICS												Hydrogeochemistry and geothermal characteristics of the Tertiary White Lake basin are described in order to provide constraints on the hydrogeology and thermal regime of the basin. The basin can be divided into three flow subsystems on the basis of chemical and isotopic variations. The groundwaters evolve chemically from young Ca-Mg-HCO3 type waters in the shallow surficial sediments to Na-dominated waters in the deeper intermediate system. Surface waters and shallow groundwaters collected from wells completed in overburden have undergone extensive evaporation as evidenced by their enriched delta(18)O and delta(2)H composition. Minor evaporation identified in the isotope composition of groundwater from domestic wells completed in bedrock, as well as from springs, suggests a local to intermediate origin for these waters, and perhaps mixing with shallow evaporative waters. In contrast, the uniform isotope signatures of deep basin waters measured both spatially and vertically suggest recharge at higher elevations, and a much deeper circulation system that is essentially isolated from the shallow subsurface. Chemical geothermometry indicates that spring waters and bedrock well waters have equilibrated at temperatures of less than 20 and 60degreesC, respectively. Groundwaters encountered by deep diamond drill holes, with equilibration temperatures of less than 80degreesC, are representative of intermediate flow systems, and may serve to modify the heat flow regime in the basin. Regional groundwater flow within the basin is complex due to numerous faults that exert a strong influence on fluid circulation patterns. Transport of heat in the subsurface, which has resulted in variations in the measured thermal gradients across the basin, occurs either at depths greater than those investigated in this study or has been significantly influenced by the circulation of cooler groundwater in the central part of the basin.

Although a large number of lakes across the globe are systematically monitored, it is rare to have a wide range of ecological indices measured at high enough frequency and over a sufficient time scale to allow characterisation of the response of a lake ecosystem to such events. We present data from Lough Feeagh, a relatively large oligotrophic lake in Ireland, which was at the epicentre of a once in 250-year precipitation event in July 2009 when 50 mm of rain fell in less than 2 hours. The effects of the resulting flood on the water column stability, chemistry, biology, and metabolism were examined, and data from multiple years before and after the event were used to ascertain the significance and longevity of any observed changes. The flood caused the water column to destabilise prematurely and depressed primary production. Bacterial biomass was high in the month after the flood, and zooplankton assemblages in late 2009 were significantly different from those of other years. Changes in all these variables combined to produce lower rates of gross primary production and higher rates of respiration than those measured between 2010 and 2014, resulting in more pronounced negative net ecosystem production than in the other years. Despite all these changes, the normal seasonal cycles resumed in 2010, and it appears that this rare but significant event did not have a long-term impact on the ecosystem functioning of the lake.

Orbital control of western North America atmospheric circulation and climate over two glacial cycles	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												The now arid Great Basin of western North America hosted expansive late Quaternary pluvial lakes, yet the climate forcings that sustained large ice age hydrologic variations remain controversial. Here we present a 175,000 year oxygen isotope record from precisely-dated speleothems that documents a previously unrecognized and highly sensitive link between Great Basin climate and orbital forcing. Our data match the phasing and amplitudes of 65 degrees N summer insolation, including the classic saw-tooth pattern of global ice volume and on-time terminations. Together with the observation of cold conditions during the marine isotope substage 5d glacial inception, our data document a strong precessional-scale Milankovitch forcing of southwestern paleoclimate. Because the expansion of pluvial lakes was associated with cold glacial conditions, the reappearance of large lakes in the Great Basin is unlikely until ca. 55,000 years into the future as climate remains in a mild non-glacial state over the next half eccentricity cycle.

One of the major objectives of this survey was to estimate the number and location of acidified lakes. The lakes for the survey were chosen by random sampling and the selection was weighted by lake density. The water quality of the surveyed lakes can thus be considered as representative of the target lake populations. The results show high concentrations of organic matter in lakes throughout the country. In southern parts of Finland, where deposition is highest, the anthropogenic contribution to the acidity is more important than the catchment derived organic acidity. At present, about 18% of the Finnish lakes had little or no bicarbonate buffer capacity (alkalinity < 10-mu-eq.L-1). Elevated inorganic aluminum con-centrations are found mainly in southern Finland, suggesting that to date the harmful effects of lake acidity to fisheries are concentrated in the southern part of the country. Many lakes in northern Finland are poorly buffered clearwater lakes and are at significant risk for water-quality deterioration with the present atmo-spheric loadings.					; Kortelainen, Pirkko/AAN-7045-2020	Forsius, Martin/0000-0003-0125-5120; Kortelainen, Pirkko/0000-0002-1448-0688; 													0044-7447					FEB	1991	20	1					23	27																WOS:A1991EZ34300007

The analysis of 2576 tows is reported giving detailed consideration to sampling problems and statistical methods. The most common larvae were rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), caught in about 50% of the tows, and yellow perch (Perca flavescens), clupeids and cyprinids, caught in about 10-20% of the tows. Most of the data contained too high proportions of zero catches to be transformed to approximately normal distribution, and were thus analyzed using the log-linear model rather than by analysis of variance. Except for cyprinids, larval fish seemed to be scarce in surface waters during the day. Small (4-10 mm long) smelt and perch larvae were caught more frequently in 526- than in 782-.mu.m mesh nets. Very few perch and cyprinid larvae longer than 10 mm were ever caugth. This, and a more rapid decline of daytime than nighttime catches of larvaL smelt through the mid-summer suggest that the nets were avoided by at least the larger. If avoidance of sampling gear is substantial, larval fish abundances may be overestimated in years of slow growth when the larvae remain catchable longer. No evidence was seen that the recent industrial development at Nanticoke, Ontario, has affected larval fish abundances so far. As the annual mean densities of larval fish varied 15-fold or more, it would require several years of observations to detect any but drastic future change from the current levels of abundance.																			0380-1330						1983	9	4					452	467		10.1016/S0380-1330(83)71919-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(83)71919-2													WOS:A1983RS94500003

Based on an automatic detection and tracking algorithm and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis version 5 (ERA5) dataset, the characteristics of the frequency, lifetime, moving distance, moving speed, and intensity of Mongolian ETCs in spring during 1979-2021 are investigated. The results show that 92.6% of the Mongolian ETCs are locally formed. There were two decadal changes in the Mongolian ETC frequency in approximately 1993 and 2004, showing a "high-low-high" variation. In terms of ETC passages, there is an increasing trend from central Mongolia to Northeast China and a decreasing trend east of Lake Baikal, indicating that the Mongolian ETC tracks are located more southward. Based on the standard deviation ellipse method and K-means clustering, the Mongolian ETCs are clustered into three categories, namely, southern track (ST, accounting for 53.4% of Mongolian ETCs) ETCs, northern track (NT, accounting for 43.8%) ETCs, and long track (LT, accounting for 2.8%) ETCs. The ST ETCs have a significant increasing trend, while the NT ETCs show a significant decreasing trend. Moreover, the other properties of Mongolian ETCs also show significant decadal variability. The sequences of lifetime, moving distance, moving speed and intensity exhibit decadal changes in the 1990s, with longer lifetime and moving distance, faster moving speed, and stronger intensity after the abrupt change.																			0930-7575	1432-0894				OCT	2024	62	10					9733	9754		10.1007/s00382-024-07369-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-024-07369-x		SEP 2024											WOS:001304425500001

Samples were taken monthly (2006-2009) at five stations. The total rotifer abundance exponentially declined and reached a relatively stable stage in 2009. Polyarthra dolichoptera and Trichocerca pusilla dominated the rotifer community in most seasons. TN, TP, and CODMn went down at the beginning of the monitoring period, rebounded in the second winter, and then decreased and reached a stable state in 2009. CCA showed that the most significant variations were caused by fluctuations in temperature, CODMn, SRP, and NO2-N. The rotifer community experienced a two-stage succession and the difference of species between the stages was exhibited during warm seasons. GAMs indicated that the selected factors were responsible for 64.8% of the total rotifer abundance variance and 16.5 similar to 64.3% of the variances of individual species abundance. Most of the environmental parameters had effects on rotifer abundance that could only be described by complicated curves, characterised by unimodality and bimodality instead of linearity. Our study highlighted the temperature influence on rotifer species composition and total abundance in subtropical lakes.

J	Lorenz, RD				Lorenz, Ralph D.			Voyage across Ligeia Mare: Mechanics of sailing on the hydrocarbon seas of Saturn's Moon, Titan	OCEAN ENGINEERING												Like sailing ships, drifting buoys and icebergs on the seas of Earth, the motion of a capsule floating on the cold methane/ethane seas of Saturn's moon Titan results from the balance of aerodynamic and hydrodynamic forces above and below the 'waterline'. This balance is evaluated in the context of a NASA proposal to send such a capsule to perform oceanographic and other measurements on the similar to 400 km wide Ligeia Mare in 2023. Taking liquid and air density into account (the sea:air density ratio on Titan is similar to 100, compared with similar to 800 on Earth) in the drag balance, it is expected that the vehicle will drift at a fraction f of the near-surface windspeed with f similar to 0.08-0.18. Consideration of wave effects suggests a correction of the form f' similar to f(1 +0.7U(10)(4)). Winds of about 0.3 m/s are expected in this season (late Northern summer), and drift trajectories using two different global circulation models are computed. It is expected that the vehicle would encounter the coastline after drifting similar to 150 km over 2-10 Titan days (similar to 32-150 Earth days.) (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, little is known about their interactive effects on theses stressors and the role of lake depth on these interactions. We used field surveys to compared zooplankton assemblages over four seasons in eight Yunnan Plateau lakes with different trophic states, salinization levels, and water depths. The results showed that: 1) the species number (S), density (D-Zoop), and biomass (B-Zoop) of zooplankton exhibited strong seasonal dynamics, being overall higher in the warm seasons. 2) Data collected over four seasons and summer data both revealed highly significant positive relationships of S, D-Zoop, and B-Zoop with total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and phytoplankton chlorophyll a (Chl a). 3) S, D-Zoop, and B-Zoop displayed a unimodal relationship with salinity, peaking at 400-1000 mu S/cm (conductivity, to reflect salinity). 4) The two large-sized taxa (cladocerans and copepods) generally increased at low-moderate levels of TN, TP, Chl a, and Cond and was constant or decreased at high levels. The average body mass (biomass/density) of crustaceans decreased with increasing TN, TP, Chl a, and conductivity. Our findings indicate that zooplankton may be more vulnerable in deep lakes than in shallow lakes when exposed to conductivity stress even under mesotrophic conditions, and the overall decrease in size in zooplankton assemblages under the combined stress of eutrophication and salinization may result in a lowered grazing effect on phytoplankton.

Although the establishment and development of biological populations are important themes in ecology, our understanding of the formation of such patterns on the rocks is still in its infancy. Here, we present a novel model of the concurrent growth, establishment and interaction of lichens. We introduce an inverse technique based on Monte Carlo simulations to test our model on field samples of lichen communities. We derive an expression for the time needed for a community to cover a surface and predict the historical spatial dynamics of field samples. Lichens are frequently used for dating the time of exposure of rocks in glacial deposits, lake retreats or rock falls. We suggest our method as a way to improve the dating.

Age and Growth of Freshwater Drum and Gizzard Shad Occupying Two Reservoir-River Complexes with Different Groundwater Contributions	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Restoring groundwater flow is a management option that improves water temperature regimes and benefits fishes. Although this strategy applies more readily to river systems, the thermal character of reservoirs is heavily influenced by inflowing rivers. We examined differences in age, structure, and growth of both Freshwater Drum Aplodinotus grunniens and Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum that occupy catchments with varying groundwater contributions in the south-central United States. Seepage run data indicated that the Kiamichi River was losing surface water to groundwater in summer 2016, whereas groundwater inflows were apparent in the Elk River basin. Summer 2016 data showed that the Elk River had cooler water temperatures than the Kiamichi River and Grand Lake O' the Cherokees water temperatures were similar to those in the incoming Elk River. We found higher densities of older Freshwater Drum and Gizzard Shad (maximums of 32 and 8 years old, respectively) in samples from the Grand basin than among fish that were sampled from the Kiamichi River basin (21 and 6 years old, respectively). Freshwater Drum grew at similar rates in both basins even though they reached larger maximum lengths in the Grand basin (649 mm TL) than in the Kiamichi River basin (600 mm). The average asymptotic length was greater for the Kiamichi population (L-infinity = 613 mm) than for the Grand population (L-infinity = 557 mm). Gizzard Shad from the Grand basin were larger than those from the Kiamichi River basin, though the latter population grew faster initially (Brody growth coefficient: K = 0.787 versus K = 0.179, respectively), but they had smaller asymptotic length (L-infinity = 206 mm versus L-infinity = 343 mm). The role that groundwater plays in temperature regulation in these basins partially explains the observed differences. Our results suggest that the metabolic theory of ecology can be applied to fisheries management at a finer spatial scale.

In contrast, these studies are rare in Fennoscandia in northern Europe. We here integrate an extensive multi-proxy data set obtained on sediments of MIS 5d-c age that form part of a long sediment record preserved at Sokli in northern Finland. We make a detailed interpretation of the vegetation and depositional history for MIS 5d-c using pollen, macrofossils, diatoms and other siliceous microfossils, insect remains, and sediment characteristics, and combine these data with recently published estimates on July temperatures based on chironomids and selected plant indicator species in order to make inferences of paleo-climate regimes. The fossil record obtained on the seven meter thick MIS 5d-c deposit at Sokli is exceptionally rich in species due to the large variety of habitats associated with an overall fluvial depositional environment. A braided river system flanked by steppe-tundra vegetation is inferred for MIS 5d. Mean July temperatures of at least 12-14 degrees C are indicated by chironomids and plant indicator species and are in agreement with the presence of conifers and birch trees as recorded by macrofossils. The reconstructed environmental conditions suggest strong continental climate conditions at Sokli during MIS 5d. The gradual infilling of an oxbow lake and subsequent return to stream channel deposition is traced in great detail in the overlying gyttja and gravelly sediment of MIS 5c age. The terrestrial pollen and plant macrofossil record from the gyttja shows the establishment of birch forest followed by the spread of pine and then spruce. Rich plant indicator species assemblages indicate that the boreal environment at Sokli during MIS 5c experienced July temperatures several degrees higher than the present-day value of 13 degrees C. The high summer temperatures and presence of larch suggest more continental conditions. More open vegetation returned at Sokli during late MIS 5c and was followed by glaciation by the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet (MIS 5b). Despite the major differences in zonal vegetation types during MIS 5d-c, differences in reconstructed July temperatures are minor and suggest that winter temperatures combined with precipitation values mostly determined the stadial-interstadial climate variability. The most compelling conclusion from our study is that forest development during MIS 5c was remarkably similar to that recorded for the Eemian (MIS 5e) and Holocene Interglacials at the high-latitude site Sokli, and also to that inferred from MIS 5c sediments on the northern European mainland. Our results question the definition of MIS 5c in the terrestrial record of Europe as an interstadial interval of the last glacial cycle and suggest inclusion of MIS 5c together with the Eemian (MIS 5e) in an interglacial complex.

In this study, we investigate the climatic significance of magnetic parameters for analysing the variability of the past climate. For this, we performed comprehensive time-series and statistical analysis on previously published proxy data from a 168-m-long drill core (Core-HQ) that spans similar to 900-30 ka, comprising mainly magnetic parameters and carbonate content (CC). Moreover, we investigated magnetic properties of modern soil in the catchment that predominantly formed on limestone bedrock. Key findings are: (1) modern soils and sediments of Core-HQ both contain a mixture of magnetite (Mt), maghemite (Mgh) and hematite (Ht), but magnetic concentration of the soils is one order higher; (2) a superparamagnetic (SP) fraction of Mt/Mgh dominates in the soils whereas in Core-HQ the SP contribution is generally very low; (3) a larger grain-size fraction of Mt/Mgh and Ht is also present in the soils. We explain variations of magnetic concentration and CC in Core-HQ by an increased wind transport of soil and a decreased surface water transport of carbonate and soil in less humid periods. Low-temperature oxidation of magnetite in the catchment is as another crucial process that reflects weathering conditions and is likely sensitive to humidity; the degree of LTO can be semi-quantified by the magnetic parameters ARM/SIRM and S-ratio. Combining CC, ARM/SIRM and S-ratio values, we derive a weathering intensity (WI). The WI index variation along Core-HQ shows strong fluctuations on a 100-kyr eccentricity scale in the lower part, especially during similar to 630-380 ka, followed by a long period (similar to 320-80 ka) of persistently weaker weathering (drier?) conditions with low variability, and a rapid return of much stronger weathering (wetter?) conditions at similar to 80 ka. We suggest that a reduced influence of the Indian summer monsoon accounts for less moisture supply to the region and lower climatic variability.

Four habitats were sampled, one open water and three vegetated; vegetated zones were dominated by panic grass Panicum spp., hydrilla Hydrilla verticillata, or a community of mixed floating and emergent vegetation was an important nursery area for juvenile fish of many species, perhaps due to its structural complexity, and the panic grass was especially important for larvae. Larvae of most species first appeared in Orange Lake at temperatures similar to those at which they appear in temperate lakes, but larvae were present on almost all sampling dates (including those in winter). Larvae of golden shiners Notemigonus crysoleucas, threadfin shad Dorosoma petenense, and gizzard shad D. cepedianum appeared on earlier dates than in temperate systems. Larvae of individual species were present over a longer period than in temperate systems, reflecting longer spawning seasons in Orange Lake. Habitat use by larvae was variable for several species; larval bluegills Lepomis macrochirus, which are typically considered limnetic, inhabited panic grass and hydrilla, in addition to open water.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAY	1990	119	3					521	528		10.1577/1548-8659(1990)119<0521:DAAOEL>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1990)119<0521:DAAOEL>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1990EH46000014

Consolidation of gyttja in a rewetted fen peatland: Potential implications for restoration	MIRES AND PEAT												Water availability is a major concern when restoring degraded vacuum harvested peatlands. The seasonal expression of water arising from the compression of underlying organic deposits may provide a source of water. A bog near Rimouski, Quebec (Canada) was harvested using the vacuum extraction method and cut down to underlying sedge peat; restoration procedures were implemented in the autumn of 2009. The residual peat layer is 0.4-1 m thick, and overlies a 1-1.5 m thick gyttja deposit. Gyttja is a coprogenous lake bottom sediment on which peat sometimes forms. Little is known about the hydrophysical properties of gyttja and the implications it may have for peatland restoration. The upper 40 cm of gyttja had average bulk density 0.12 g cm(-3), particle density 1.57 g cm(-3) and porosity 92 %. The organic matter and fibre contents of the gyttja were > 45 %, and both decreased with depth. Oedometer test results showed 9 and 72 % strain at 3.5 and 200 kPa, respectively, demonstrating the potential for water release upon compression, which in the field is caused by water table lowering. However, during the year of measurement (2011) the changes in effective stress caused by water table lowering were < 1 kPa, corresponding to a water table decline of < 10 cm. Under these conditions the volumetric moisture content of the top 30 cm of gyttja decreased by only 0.4 % and we observed 0.5 cm of gyttja settlement; this represented 0.4 % and 1.7 % strain, respectively. On the basis of these strains, we conclude that the release of water due to the consolidation of gyttja in 2011 had little impact on rewetting of the overlying peat. However, it may be important under drier conditions with a larger seasonal water deficit, and may have been important prior to restoration when larger water table fluctuations were observed.																			1819-754X						2017	19								05	10.19189/MaP.2015.OMB.200	http://dx.doi.org/10.19189/MaP.2015.OMB.200													WOS:000397047800005
J	Panagiotopoulos, K; Aufgebauer, A; Schäbitz, F; Wagner, B				Panagiotopoulos, Konstantinos; Aufgebauer, Anne; Schaebitz, Frank; Wagner, Bernd			Vegetation and climate history of the Lake Prespa region since the Lateglacial	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Pollen assemblages of a sediment sequence (Co1215) from Lake Prespa reveal substantial vegetational and environmental changes on a regional scale for the Lateglacial and Holocene. The age-depth model, based on radiocarbon dating and tephrochronology, indicates continuous sedimentation for the last c. 17 000 cal BP. An open landscape with prominent cold-resistant steppe vegetation and isolated tree patches (mainly Pinus) is inferred for the Lateglacial. The pollen data suggest the survival of numerous temperate deciduous trees in sheltered and favorable habitats despite the harsh climate conditions. The increase of Pious and the subsequent drop in herb values both point to the expansion of pines at higher elevations and/or the thickening of their stands during the Bolling/Allerod. The coeval rise of oak values and the increase of tree diversity imply rising temperatures and an increase in moisture availability. A reversal to stadial conditions, marked by Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae maxima, characterizes the Younger Dryas chronozone. Climate change during the Early Holocene resulted in the expansion and subsequent diversification of deciduous woodland. The continuous pollen curves of maquis constituents, such as Pistacia and Phillyrea, point to higher mean annual and winter temperatures. An abrupt short-lived reversal, associated with the 8200 cal BP cooling event, was distinguished by a distinct peak of Artemisia percentages. After 7900 cal BP arboreal percentages increased and the Prespa area underwent significant changes in floristic composition. The appearance of crop plant pollen and the increase of weed percentages suggest the intensification of agriculture and can be traced back to c. 2000 cal BP. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

We conducted microcosm experiments to examine the effect of viruses and heterotrophic nanoflagellates (together referred to as top-down factors) on prokaryotic standing stock and prokaryotic community composition during the clear water phase (autumn season) in the oligotrophic Lake Pavin in France. 2. In the experimental treatments containing viruses and viruses plus flagellates, the dissolved organic matter released through top-down activity appeared to stimulate prokaryotic biomass production and viral proliferation. 3. About 68% of the total prokaryotic abundance detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed the dominance of typical freshwater groups, which included Beta-proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Cytophaga-Flavobacterium subgroups at the start of the experiments. 4. The manipulation of viruses and flagellates (presence or absence) was successful in inducing significant changes in prokaryotic community composition at a broad phylogenetic level, suggesting that prokaryotic lifestyles are influenced by top-down factors. The Beta-proteobacteria subgroup, which outgrew other prokaryotic groups in the absence of viruses and flagellates, was strongly suppressed and vulnerable to mortality in the presence of both the factors. Alpha-proteobacteria and Actinobacteria subgroups grew significantly in the presence of top-down factors, suggesting that the dissolved organic matter (regenerated nutrients) released through their activity favoured the development of these groups. The Cytophaga-Flavobacterium subgroup failed to show any functional response in the presence or absence of top-down factors. 5. Low prokaryotic diversity in the experimental treatment containing viruses and high diversity in the presence of both top-down factors were observed. We found synergistic interactions in treatments when both top-down factors were present, suggesting that the process of nutrient regeneration was crucial in sustaining stable prokaryotic communities.					; Sime-Ngando, Télesphore/M-4134-2019	Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/0000-0002-7240-5803; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				SEP	2014	59	9					1945	1955		10.1111/fwb.12398	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12398													WOS:000339480500014

The historical record of these chemicals in Lake Ontario sediments agrees well with the use of the Hyde Park dump in the city of Niagara Falls, NY [USA]. These compounds first appeared in sediments in 1958 and rapidly increased until 1970. These dates coincide with the onset of dumping at Hyde Park and remedial action undertaken when this dump was closed, respectively.

J	SIMONS, TJ				SIMONS, TJ			CONTINUOUS DYNAMICAL COMPUTATIONS OF WATER TRANSPORTS IN LAKE ERIE FOR 1970	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												A numerical model of Lake Erie [Canada, USA] was used to compute water transports throughout the 1970 shipping season on the basis of continuous wind observations from 6 shore stations. A vertically integrated model was used for quasi-homogeneous conditions, and a 2-layer model was employed to simulate summer stratification. The computed water circulations were retained for a study of the horizontal distribution of various chemical parameters measured by regular ship cruises on the lake during this period. Computed surface elevations were compared with observed water level data to verify the model calculations and to adjust the windstress coefficient from month to month. The coefficient of correlation between observed and computed Buffalo [New York, USA]-minus-Toledo [Ohio, USA] water setup averages out to .95 for the complete integration period. A comparison was made of model results and available data from current meters maintained in the lake during this period. The results show the feasibility of quasi-operational applications of a model of the present type for computing the necessary water transport information for ecosystems modeling and water resources planning.																									1976	33	3					371	384		10.1139/f76-060	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f76-060													WOS:A1976BJ94800003

The area features thermal springs with temperatures of 19-23 degrees C which are exploited by abstraction wells. The occurrence of low-temperature geothermal systems, which are common in the Alps, are associated with specific hydrogeological conditions, such as vertical hydraulic connectivity between different geological formations, relatively large elevation differences along flow paths, and the concentrated upwelling of geothermal water to the surface. The occurrence of the low-temperature geothermal field is explained by the presence of a hydraulically conductive fault along with a regional groundwater flow pattern that supports deep groundwater circulation. Hydraulic measurements and temperature data were collected from springs and wells in the area to support the analysis of flow patterns, together with the construction of a basin-scale 2D numerical flow and heat transport simulation. The diverse topographic and geological conditions result in a multi-scale groundwater flow system. The discharge of thermal waters in the Lake Bled area is a consequence of the upwelling of deep groundwater induced by a combination of the similar to 650 m difference in hydraulic head and hydrogeological heterogeneity and anisotropy, related to faulting of the geological formations. In addition, individual flow subsystems were found to significantly affect the natural heat distribution and travel times within the basin-scale system. The study highlights the combination of a basin scale approach taking into consideration local to regional-scale heterogeneities and faults in order to better understand the hydrogeological behaviour of Alpine groundwater systems.

Examining effects of elevated temperature, pH, and salinity on early growth of Zizania palustris L. to improve restoration outcomes in Michigan lakes	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Naturally occurring populations of Zizania palustris have declined in abundance since the 1800s. Due to its cultural, economic, and ecological importance, it has been the target of restoration. We aimed to inform restoration of Z. palustris in Michigan by performing experiments examining how conditions in restoration sites and future human impacts such as warmed water and elevated salinity affect Z. palustris during early phenophases. In a mesocosm study, we raised pH to levels seen in Wycamp Lake (over 8.5), where Z. palustris restoration success was limited, and found decreased germination by 50% and seedling biomass by 60%. No other responses analyzed were influenced by pH whereas increasing water temperature to 24 degrees C, simulating warming with climate change and warm spring conditions found in Wycamp Lake, decreased germination by 80%, decreased root and shoot biomass by 30 and 40%, respectively, caused spindly shoot morphology, and accelerated onset of germination by 1.2 days and floating leaf phenophase by 3.6 days. With concerns about road salt impacts on restored Z. palustris populations, we raised salinity to 500 mg NaCl L-1 in a mesocosm experiment with no impact. A growth chamber experiment showed that adding NaCl up to similar to 1000 mgL(-1) increased Z. palustris biomass and germination with negative impacts above that threshold. In conclusion, Z. palustris is somewhat tolerant of increased salinity. However, high pH and warm water could impact restoration outcomes in Michigan lakes with warm spring water likely becoming a larger concern for Z. palustris restoration with climate change.																			0923-4861	1572-9834				AUG	2024	32	4					605	619		10.1007/s11273-024-09999-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-024-09999-8		JUN 2024											WOS:001254184700001

Depopulation in the Visok micro-region: Toward demographic and economic revitalization	OPEN GEOSCIENCES												The demographic potential of the settlements in the Visok micro-region has been significantly disrupted since 1948. The latest census (2022) shows that the Visok micro-region now consists of very small settlements, all with fewer than 100 inhabitants. In all 22 villages of the Visok micro-region, there are only 504 inhabitants, with unfavorable age structures. The region's average age has remained above 65 for the last 30 years, significantly older than the surrounding areas. Low salaries, bad infrastructure, and the industrialization of Pirot City represent the main reasons for depopulation. The Zavoj Lake catastrophe caused three villages to be submerged, which accelerated depopulation even more. Most of the remaining inhabitants are engaged in farming or work in the construction, stone, and forestry industries, with sheep farming being a notable tradition. The local population shows strong ecological awareness, advocating for industries that align with nature, creating an ideal environment for nature enthusiasts and scientists. The only way for revitalization is to have organized seasonal migrations based on the summer tourist season. The main aim for revitalization would be a national-level plan for creating a brand of untouched nature, with traditional agricultural products for the complete experience.																			2391-5447					FEB 28	2025	17	1							20220703	10.1515/geo-2022-0703	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/geo-2022-0703													WOS:001433910200001

Great progress has been made in the reconstruction of paleoclimate and paleoenvironment from the Early Holocene onwards based on chronostratigraphy and proxies of aeolian sedimentary sequences in the Mu Us Desert (MUD). However, previous studies have given rise to some controversial over the timing of the Holocene optimum period, and there is a scarcity of studies on the sediment provenance evolution of the desert during the Holocene and its internal relationship with the East Asian summer (EASM) and winter (EAWM) monsoons. Here, we provide new elemental geochemical data from a fluvial-aeolian sedimentary sequence in the southern MUD; we then combine these data with other available elemental data and hydroclimatology information to investigate the characteristics of sediment source evolution and their possible connection with the EASM and EAWM on the southern margin of the MUD-desert/loess transition zone since the latter part of the Early-Holocene. The elemental composition and geochemical characteristics of the studied sedimentary sequence differed markedly in the periods before and after 6.4 ka BP, suggesting a change in the source of the sediments across this boundary. From the late Early-Holocene (10.6 cal. ka BP), sediments were dominated by the chemical weathering products of local source material, with a gradual increase in chemical weathering over time, indicating a gradual strengthening of the EASM; the EASM reached its peak Holocene strength at 8.4-6.4 ka BP, accompanied by a moderate level of chemical weathering. After 6.4 ka BP, with the weakening of monsoon precipitation, the EAWM began to strengthen, and long-distance transport of source material from the west and northwest increased; however, chemical weathering of local source material driven by the EASM remained dominant until 4.0 ka BP. After 4.0 ka BP, the EAWM became dominant, and sediments showed strong sedimentary cycles, mainly transported from long-distance sources by aeolian activity, and the MUD became an important sedimentary sink for the northern-central deserts. After 0.7 ka BP, the sediments in the MUD became a mixture of different-age sediments due to river scouring and the transport of pre-existing sediments along the shoreline. Collectively, the elemental geochemical and other proxy data from Holocene sediments on the southern margin of the MUD record an inverse relationship between the EASM and EAWM; these two monsoonal circulations have alternated in their control of the sedimentary source characteristics and geomorphological environmental evolution processes across the southern margin of the MUD during the Holocene.

Based on waterbird censuses from 2001 to 2016, community structure and abundance trends of waterbirds were analyzed, as well as the potential correlations with the water level of Poyang Lake. The results showed that the annual average number of waterbirds in Poyang Lake was 426,707 +/- 150,170, with 111 species from 17 families. Waterfowl was the most abundant family accounting for 74.4 +/- 8.8% of all individuals, followed by shorebirds (14.8 +/- 8.5%), wading birds (6.5 +/- 1.8%) and open-water/waterbirds (4.4 +/- 1.9%). Although waterbird abundance fluctuated dramatically, there were no significant trends in the abundance of most guilds or in total waterbird abundance; only geese significantly increased among the eight groups. Analysis of trends of 37 relatively abundant or regularly occurring species indicated that population trends appeared to be species-specific. As for the correlations between water level and waterbird abundance, only shorebirds showed significant correlations with average July water level, average water level, and high water level duration in wet season among four guilds, i.e. waterfowl, wading bird, shorebird and, open-water and waterbird. At the group level, abundances of swans, geese, and ducks were significantly correlated with monthly average water level during the wet season, and wader abundance was significantly correlated with average water levels and high water level duration during the wet season. Correlations between population abundance and monthly water level also exhibited species-specific patterns.

The degree of observed changes showed a general relationship to distance from the Sudbury smelters, indicating that reduced contaminant deposition from Sudbury sources was responsible for the observed improvements. Although changes in water quality have occurred in many Sudbury area lakes over the course of this study, many lakes remain acidic and metal-contaminated.

Selective Exclusion of Aromatic Organic Carbon During Lake Ice Formation	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Earth's lakes at northern latitudes are mostly ice-covered in winter. When lake water freezes, some organic matter dissolved in the water is excluded from the ice. We performed complementary field sampling and laboratory freeze-up experiments to explore how freeze-up may impact the partitioning and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in boreal lakes. We found that 16.2 +/- 4.7% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was retained in the overlying ice, 81.3 +/- 5.7% of DOC was expelled to underlying unfrozen water, and 1.3 +/- 0.7% was expelled as flocs. During ice formation, nitrogen (TDN, total dissolved nitrogen), ions (specific conductance), and oxidized and aromatic DOM were preferentially expelled to the underlying water column. The apparent retention factor DOCIce: DOCBefore decreased from clearwater to brownwater lakes, that is, with increasing allochthonous DOC lost from lake ice, indicating that DOM exclusion from the ice cover will become more prevalent as lakes experience browning.					; Tranvik, Lars/H-2222-2011; Kothawala, Dolly/J-1867-2015	Jakobsson, Elizabeth/0000-0001-8207-6487; Tranvik, Lars J./0000-0003-3509-8266; Zhou, Yongqiang/0000-0003-1402-345X; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				FEB 28	2023	50	4							e2022GL101414	10.1029/2022GL101414	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022GL101414													WOS:000949591400001

In this study, microscopy-based isolation with physiological and molecular phylogenetic characterization were performed to investigate and characterize the 2-MIB odor producers that caused an odor problem in the freshwater system of the North Han River in the autumn of 2018. A benthic cyanobacterium was isolated from 2-MIB odor-issue freshwater samples and was found to be phylogenetically affiliated with Pseudanabaena yagii (99.66% sequence similarity), which was recorded in South Korea for the first time. The 2-MIB synthesis gene sequences from the odor-issue freshwater samples showed 100% similarity with those in the P. yagii strains. Protein sequences of 2-MIB synthase observed in the genome of the isolated strain showed structural and functional characteristics similar to those observed in other Pseudanabaena species. The 2-MIB production rate increased slowly during mat formation on the vessel wall; however, it rapidly increased after the temperature dropped. The 2-MIB gene was continuously expressed regardless of the temperature changes. These results suggest that the 2-MIB odor issue in the North Han River might be caused by the release of 2-MIB from the mat-forming P. yagii species in a low-temperature freshwater environment.

Hydrochemical processes in the lower Jordan valley and in the Dead Sea area	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Changes in the concentrations of major, some minor and trace elements occurring in both surface and groundwater of the lower Jordan River-Dead Sea drainage basin have been investigated in order to identify the characteristics of the regional aquifers and their recharge areas. Spider patterns of elements and rare earth distribution patterns pinpoint the characteristic chemical features of groundwater. As compared to seawater, the high Br/Cl ratios in groundwater are caused either by high Br/Cl ratios in precipitation, by leaching of Br from bituminous matter or by mixing with brines beyond the epsomite stage. The locations of groundwater samples with enhanced B contents coincide with the distribution of gypsum in the beds of the Lisan Formation, which produces water with nearly constant B/SO42- molar ratios. Aeolian distribution of the unconsolidated Lisan sediments influences the B/SO4 ratio in the area of Lake Tiberias and in the Jordan Highlands. The high Gd anomaly in the Dead Sea water is of geologic origin whereas that in the Jordan River and in Nahal (stream) Qidron is largely anthropogenic. The anthropogenic Gd input to the Dead Sea is insignificant compared to the actual amount in the water of the Dead Sea. Hot saline water encountered along the western shores of the Dead Sea with high Gd anomalies indicate that they contain large amounts of ancient Dead Sea water that mix (as hot ascending brines) with fresh water. The recharge area of groundwater in the lower Jordan Valley extends largely over limestone and dolomite outcrops of the Upper Cretaceous Judea Group. Weathering of locally underlying Lower Cretaceous volcanics in the area of Pezael-Beqaot, and Argaman yield groundwater with delta S-34(SO42-) values ranging from -2 to +4 parts per thousand. The presence of sulphide-bearing bodies in this area is attested to magnetic anomalies detected at depths of several kilometres. delta S-34(SO42-) indicates very deep groundwater circulation. High delta S-34(SO42-) > 15%. is typical for marine sulphates from the Judea and Avedat Group limestone. The springs located along the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea discharge water replenished on the eastern Judea Mountains. The increase in the salinity of this water is due to brines flushed from sediments and from adjacent sedimentary rocks, which host entrapped brines from the precursors of the Dead Sea formed during the late stages of Lake Lisan. Fresher water flushes out these residual brines as a result of falling sea level. Salinity increase in groundwater is also affected by the ascent of deep-seated hot brines from pre-Sedom periods along the Rift faults. Calculations of mixing between fresh and highly saline end-members show that leaching of anhydrite from sediments, precipitation of calcite, formation of dolomite, albitization of plagioclase and ion exchange with abundant clay minerals control the major-element composition of the saline groundwater.

However, for the third time in 10 years, an International Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) Breeding and Winter Census was conducted throughout, the species range in 2001. Nearly 1,400 participants from 32 U.S. states and Puerto Rico; 9 Canadian provinces; St. Pierre and Miquelon, France; Cuba; and the Bahamas visited 2,244 sites covering 11,836 km of shoreline habitat. During the winter census, 2,389 piping plovers were observed at 33.5% of potentially occupied sites (n = 352). Of these, 56.8% had <= 10 birds present. The breeding census recorded 5,945 adults at 777 of 1,892 sites surveyed. More than 80% of sites with piping plovers present had 510 birds. Results indicated an 8.4% increase from 1991 but only a 0.2% increase since 1996. Regional trends suggest that since 1991, number of breeding birds increased on the Atlantic Coast by 78% (2,920 birds; 12.4% increase sit-ice 1996) and by 80% in the Great Lakes (72 birds; 50% increase since 1996). However, plovers declined 15% (2,953 birds; 10% decline since 1996) in Prairie Canada/U.S. northern Great Plains. Subregional trends since 1991 reflect, a 32.4% decline in Prairie Canada (972 birds; 42.4% decline since 1996), a 2.5% decline in the U.S. northern Great Plains (1,981 birds; 24% increase since 1996), 5.5% decline in eastern Canada (481 birds; 14% increase since 1996), although a 66.2% increase on the U.S. Atlantic Coast (2,430 birds; 12% since 1996). While numbers were clown in much of the U.S. northern Great Plains since 1996, an increase (460%, 1,048 birds; 67.7% increase since 1991) was detected on the Missouri River. Results from 3 complete species census efforts provide essential data for conservation planning and assessment and illustrate the utility of global censuses for species of concern.

J	Simsek, CK; Odül, H				Simsek, Cagdas Kuscu; Odul, Halime			Investigation of the effects of wetlands on micro-climate	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Regulation of the microclimatic structure of a region by using land use planning is one of the important strategies, which is used to fight against climate change. The climatic structures of regions are also affected by wetlands as well as land use types. In the present study, based on this information, the micro-climatic effects at the 1 km and 10 km periphery of three dam lakes and two lakes (imranli Reservoir, Golova Reservoir, Dorteylul Reservoir, Lake Hafik and Lake Todurge), which are located within the boundaries of Sivas province, were investigated. Analyses were made using GIS (geographic information systems) and remote sensing techniques. The temperature values are obtained from the Landsat TM-5 images of 2007 summer season which belong to June 18, July 4, July 20, August 5. The calculated surface temperatures were related to the buffer areas of wetlands and land use classes. Buffer areas were formed of 2 types, for 10 km every 500 m and for 1 km every 100 m for each wetland. These buffer areas were cut by 45-degree angles within themselves and divided into 8 zones to increase accuracy by minimizing the effects of other factors (land use, topography, etc.) in the analyses. Analyses were performed separately for each circular zone and each land use. The results were statistically tested in 95% confidence interval. With the help of this study, the necessity of climate-sensitive land use planning was emphasized.

The samples are collected from the northern and southern margins of Schirmacher Oasis extending below the polar ice sheet and grading to coastal area respectively and main rocky land of Schirmacher including lakes. The analysis shows that most of the sediments are of medium grain size and fall in poor to very poor sorted category. An attempt has been made to interpret the depositional set-up by plotting the scatter patterns between various textural parameters, including C-M plot and arithmetic log-probability curves. The influence of physical parameters viz. low to high velocity winds, ice and meltwater on sediment characteristics has been discussed.					, Sant Gadge Baba Amravati University/AAN-5820-2021; Khare, Neloy/NYS-7821-2025	, Sant Gadge Baba Amravati University/0000-0002-3759-6755; 													0016-7622	0974-6889				MAY	2009	73	5					609	620		10.1007/s12594-009-0047-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12594-009-0047-3													WOS:000266911800003

Age, morphometry and trophic states varied among the lakes but all were thermally stratified and had anoxic hypolimnia during summer months. SOD measurements were obtained with a hemispherical, sealed chamber-type benthic respirometer fitted with a submersible recirculation pump and a sensor package for recording dissolved oxygen, temperature, conductivity and pH. SOD measurements were obtained at between two and four sites on most lakes. Temperature corrected values ranged from 0.34 to 9.02 g O2/m2.day.

Supraglacial Streams on the Greenland Ice Sheet Delineated From Combined Spectral-Shape Information in High-Resolution Satellite Imagery	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												Supraglacial meltwater streams and lakes that form each summer across large expanses of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) ablation zone have global implications for sea level rise but remain one of the least studied hydrologic systems on Earth. Remote sensing of supraglacial streams is challenging owing to their narrow width (similar to 1-30 m) and proximity to other features having similar visible/near-infrared reflectance (lakes and slush) or shape (dry stream channels, crevasses, and fractures). This letter presents a new automated "spectral-shape" procedure for delineating actively flowing streams in high-resolution satellite imagery, utilizing both spectral and pattern information. First, a modified normalized difference water index adapted for ice (NDWIice) enhances the spectral contrast between open water and drier snow/ice surfaces. Next, three NDWIice thresholds are used to mask deep-water lakes and discern open water from slush, in concert with a multipoints fast marching method to rejoin resulting stream fragments. Comparison of this procedure with manual digitization for six WorldView-2 images in southwestern Greenland demonstrates its value for detecting actively flowing supraglacial streams, particularly in slushy areas where classification performance dramatically improves (85.2% success) versus simple threshold methods (52.9% and 59.4% success for low and moderate thresholds, respectively). While a simple threshold approach is satisfactory for areas known to be slush free, the procedure outlined here enables comprehensive stream mapping across the GrIS ablation zone, regardless of slush conditions and/or the presence of similarly shaped glaciological features.					; Yang, Kang/I-1439-2013; Smith, Laurence/E-7785-2012	Yang, Kang/0000-0002-7246-8425; 													1545-598X					JUL	2013	10	4					801	805		10.1109/LGRS.2012.2224316	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2012.2224316													WOS:000320720300009

SUMMER SITUATION IN 34 MASURIAN LAKES IN 1973	EKOLOGIA POLSKA-POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Differentiation of phytoplankton biomass (0.6-92.7 mg/l) and differentiation of quantitative relations among dominant species were considerable, although the species composition of phytoplankton was similar. In 19 lakes the phytoplankton biomass was high (over 8 mg/l) and in 7 lakes it was very high (over 30 mg/l). In most deep lakes with high phytoplankton biomass dinoflagellates dominated, and in shallow lakes usually blue-green algae or less frequently both these groups and diatoms. The contribution of nannoplanktonic forms was the highest in lakes with low total phytoplankton biomass. Relations between the development of phytoplankton and some chosen environmental factors were examined.																			0070-9557						1978	26	1					53	70																WOS:A1978FW20100003

Urea in Lake Erie: Organic nutrient sources as potentially important drivers of phytoplankton biomass	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Significant evidence shows that nitrogen (N) supply may influence microbial community structure and, in some cases, the rate of primary productivity in fresh waters. To date, however, most focus has been on dissolved inorganic N (i.e., ammonia and nitrate), or dinitrogen gas. Far less is known about the effects of dissolved organic N such as urea on plankton activity, although this compound is both produced by in-lake processes and is a significant component of external loading. We evaluated the urea distribution and the activity of the major enzyme responsible for its assimilation (urease) in Lake Erie, which has a significant history of eutrophication. During 2012 and 2013, lake-wide surveys estimated surface urea concentrations and urease activity, along with phytoplankton composition and biomass, cyanobacterial toxins (microcystin), major nutrients and other physico-chemical parameters. In parallel, in situ 48-h microcosm experiments were executed to test whether different chemical forms of dissolved N could stimulate phytoplankton biomass. Results confirmed urea was a bioavailable form of N with in situ urea turnover times ranging from hours (for summer, i.e., Aug. 2012 and July 2013) to days (May 2013). Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between urease activity and both microcystin concentrations and cyanobacterial dominance. Results also indicated a potential seasonal shift in the nutrient limiting phytoplankton biomass from phosphorus (P) to N. Our results reinforce the importance of both N and P in promoting phytoplankton growth and highlighted the need to consider organic nutrient sources as potentially important drivers of cyanobacterial blooms and toxin production.

Isotope hydrology model and stable isotopes in sediment records from Balkan lakes	GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL												Isotope mass balance in lake systems is strongly correlated with several climatic factors such as temperature, evaporation, precipitation and air moisture. On the other hand, the sedimentary budget of lake basins driven by climate, tectonic and/or human impact is an essential pool of environmental records. Precipitation, springs and lake water delta D and delta O-18 isotope data were used in order to understand the key factors for the hydrological balance of Balkan lakes in West Macedonia. In general, it is concluded that the open lake Ohrida and the semi-closed lake Kastoria are more buffered hydrological as karst systems and less sensitive to evaporation effect, in contrast to the closed lake system of Prespes that present a strong dependence on climate seasonality. Based on oxygen isotopes in bulk sediments, it is concluded that in Kastoria lake basin an increased run-off on the land surface, probably under a more humid period, in 2.4 kyr BP disturbed the transition to a drier regime from mid/late Holocene to present.

J	Reavie, ED; Smol, JP				Reavie, ED; Smol, JP			Diatom-environmental relationships in 64 alkaline southeastern Ontario (Canada) lakes: a diatom-based model for water quality reconstructions	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Lake eutrophication is a problem in many areas of Ontario, although the history of nutrient enrichment is poorly documented. The aim of this study was to construct a diatom-based transfer function to infer past phosphorus levels in Ontario lakes using paleolimnological analyses. The relationship between diatom assemblages and limnological conditions was explored from a survey of diatoms preserved in the surface sediments of 64 Southern Ontario lakes, spanning a total phosphorus gradient of 0.004 to 0.054 mg L-1. Over 420 diatom taxa were identified, 98 of which were sufficiently common to be considered in statistical analyses. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) determined that pH, ammonium, aluminium, spring total phosphorus(TP), strontium, total nitrogen (TN), maximum depth (MaxZ), chlorophyll a (Chla) and mean depth were significant variables in explaining the variance in the diatom species data. The environmental optima of common diatom taxa for the limnologically important variables (TP, pH, TN, MaxZ, Chla) were calculated using weighted averaging (WA) regression and calibration techniques, and transfer functions were generated. The diatom inference model for spring TP provided a robust reconstructive relationship (r(2) = 0.637; RMSE = 0.007 mg L-1; r(boot)(2) = 0.466; RMSEboot = 0.010 mg L-1). Other variables, including pH (r(2) = 0.702; RMSE = 0.208; r(boot)(2) = 0.485; RMSEboot = 0.234), TN (r(2) = 0.574; RMSE = 0.0899 mg L-1; r(boot)(2) = 0.380; RMSEboot = 0.127 mg L-1) and MaxZ (r(2) = 0.554; RMSE = 1.05 m; r(boot)(2) = 0.380; RMSEboot = 1.490 m), were also strong, indicating that they may also be reconstructed from fossil diatom communities. This study shows that it is possible to reliably infer lakewater TP and other limnological variables in alkaline Southern Ontario lakes using the WA technique. This method has the potential to aid rehabilitation programs, as it can provide water quality managers with the means to estimate pre-enrichment phosphorus concentrations and an indication of the onset and development of nutrient enrichment in a lake.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Reavie, Euan/0000-0001-8871-5809; Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696													0921-2728					JAN	2001	25	1					25	42		10.1023/A:1008123613298	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008123613298													WOS:000167735500004

Over time, water collects in the basins of T, forming lakes that spill into adjacent basins. Our goal is to compute, for each terrain vertex, the time this vertex is flooded (covered by water). We present an I/O-efficient algorithm that solves this problem using O(sort(X) log(X/M) + sort(N)) I/Os, where N is the number of terrain vertices, X is the number of pits of the terrain, sort(N) is the cost of sorting N data items, and M is the size of the computer's main memory. Our algorithm assumes that the volumes and watersheds of the basins of T have been precomputed using existing methods.																					978-1-4503-0016-2				2010							403	412		10.1145/1810959.1811026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1810959.1811026													WOS:000281594400050

The form I gene (cbbL) was found in all samples, whereas form H (cbbM) was not retrieved from any of the samples. None of the RuBisCO sequences we obtained were closely related (nucleotide similarity, <90%) to sequences in the database. Some could be attributed to organisms isolated from the lake (Cyanobium) or appearing in enrichment cultures. Most (52%) of the sequences fell into in one clade, containing sequences that were identical to sequences retrieved from an enrichment culture grown with nitrate and sulfide, and another clade contained sequences identical to those retrieved from an arsenate-reducing, sulfide-oxidizing enrichment.																			0099-2240	1098-5336				JUN	2004	70	6					3443	3448		10.1128/AEM.70.6.3443-3448.2004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.70.6.3443-3448.2004								15184142					WOS:000221981100032

The most frequently encountered diatoms in the epilithon were Tabellaria flocculosa and Achnanthes minutissima regardless of location, whereas the predominant chlorophyte was Ulothrix zonata. These species were generally rare in the epipelon and were replaced in importance by Gyrosigma spenceri, Nitzschia obtusa, Cocconeis placentula, Amphora ovalis and Achnanthes lanceolata, depending on sampling site. The densities of the epilithon and epipelon were low in June but increased gradually during the summer, reaching maxima of 78 .times. 107 and 120 .times. 107 .mu.m3 cm-2, respectively (19.5 .times. 105 and 40 .times. 105 cells cm-2), in either Aug. or Sept. These values are among the lowest recorded for freshwaters and are probably due to continually low water temperatures and wave action rather than nutrient limitation. The most important species in the plankton in all 3 sampling areas were Dinobryon bavaricum, D. sociale, Rhodomonas minuta, Cyclotella spp., Synedra acus var. radians, and Ankistrodesmus falcatus. Plankton standing crops of up to 62 mg fresh wt m-3 were recorded in June at a temperature of 0.degree. C, and they increased to 70-91 mg m-3 (23.3 .times. 107-30.1 .times. 107 cells m-3) by Sept. These values are again among the lowest on record, a reflection of low water temperatures. The similarity in the species composition and standing crop of the plankton, epilithon and epipelon in all collection areas was due to the similarity in water chemistry and temperature throughout Great Bear Lake.																			0008-4026						1980	58	21					2294	2308		10.1139/b80-265	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b80-265													WOS:A1980KR11500008

Predictive Assessment of Socioeconomic Damage to Coastal Areas of Irkutsk Oblast as a Result of Lake Baikal Level Fluctuations	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												This paper presents for the first time the results of practice-oriented investigations for determining the magnitude of socioeconomic damage to coastal areas of Lake Baikal as a result of the highest rise of its level (457.85 m according to the Pacific Reference Frame). The study area includes the coastal areas of Baikal and some areas of the Irkutsk reservoir of Irkutsk oblast within the Slyudyansky, Irkutsky, and Olkhonsky administrative districts. When compiling the list of sites falling within the zone of potential submergence, we used the open public database of the Unified State Registry of Real Estate and a package of working large-scale cartographic products and images. Expeditions made it possible to update, correct, and complement the working registry. The list of economic facilities and infrastructure (about 200) falling within the zone of potential submergence, includes line structures, enterprises of social services, and households. A calculation of economic damage to facilities of socioeconomic activity is presented using recommended technique of assessing probable damage from the harmful effect of water and assessing the effectiveness of preventive hydroeconomic measures (as of the year 2006). The amount of damage (to facilities and main sectoral groups) is corrected using the deflator index (as of 2022 in the "construction" position in Irkutsk oblast)). Potential losses (lost profit) are illustrated by the example of recreational activity on the shores of Baikal within the boundaries of Irkutsk oblast. The possible considerable losses have been revealed in the recreational sphere as a result of direct damage to facilities and infrastructure, as well as lost profits due to a loss of attractiveness of coastal areas, including beach zones. A preliminary quantitative assessment of socioeconomic damage to coastal administrative districts of Irkutsk oblast as a result of water level fluctuations in Lake Baikal and the Irkutsk reservoir may well provide a basis for developing program-strategic directions and measures and for seeking managerial decisions of a preventive nature for minimizing negative impacts.

While terrestrially derived HDOM reference materials distributed by the International Humic Substances Society (IHSS) have been readily available to engineering and scientific communities, a microbially derived reference HDOM was not, despite the well-characterized differences in the chemistry and reactivity of HDOM derived from terrestrial versus microbial sources. To address this gap, we collected a microbial reference fulvic acid from Pony Lake (PLFA) for distribution through the IHSS. Pony Lake is a saline coastal pond on Ross Island, Antarctica, where the landscape is devoid of terrestrial plants. Sample collection occurred over a 17-day period in the summer season at Pony Lake. During this time, the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations increased nearly two-fold, and the fulvic acid fraction (collected using the XAD-8 method) accounted for 14.6% of the DOC. During the re-concentration and desalting procedures we isolated two other chemically distinct fulvic acid fractions: (1) PLFA-2, which was high in carbohydrates and (2) PLFA-CER, which was high in nitrogen. The chemical characteristics (elemental analysis, optical characterization with UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy, and C-13 NMR spectroscopy) of the three fulvic acid fractions helped to explain their behavior during isolation.					; Cory, Rose/C-4198-2016; Guerard, Jennifer/M-2434-2019	Foreman, Christine/0000-0003-0230-4692; Guerard, Jennifer/0000-0001-9042-8059; Cory, Rose/0000-0001-9867-7084; Dieser, Markus/0000-0001-8539-6646; CAWLEY, KAELIN/0000-0002-0443-0070; MCKNIGHT, DIANE/0000-0002-4171-1533													1748-9326					OCT-DEC	2013	8	4							045015	10.1088/1748-9326/8/4/045015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/8/4/045015													WOS:000329604900079
J	Koll-Egyed, T; Cardille, JA; Deutsch, E				Koll-Egyed, Talia; Cardille, Jeffrey A.; Deutsch, Eliza			Multiple Images Improve Lake CDOM Estimation: Building Better Landsat 8 Empirical Algorithms across Southern Canada	REMOTE SENSING												Coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is an important water property for lake management. Remote sensing using empirical algorithms has been used to estimate CDOM, with previous studies relying on coordinated field campaigns that coincided with satellite overpass. However, this requirement reduces the maximum possible sample size for model calibration. New satellites and advances in cloud computing platforms offer opportunities to revisit assumptions about methods used for empirical algorithm calibration. Here, we explore the opportunities and limits of using median values of Landsat 8 satellite images across southern Canada to estimate CDOM. We compare models created using an expansive view of satellite image availability with those emphasizing a tight timing between the date of field sampling and the date of satellite overpass. Models trained on median band values from across multiple summer seasons performed better (adjusted R-2 = 0.70, N = 233) than models for which imagery was constrained to a 30-day time window (adjusted R-2 = 0.45). Model fit improved rapidly when incorporating more images, producing a model at a national scale that performed comparably to others found in more limited spatial extents. This research indicated that dense satellite imagery holds new promise for understanding relationships between in situ CDOM and satellite reflectance data across large areas.

J	Ortega-Guerrero, A				Ortega-Guerrero, A			Origin and geochemical evolution of groundwater in a closed-basin clayey aquitard, Northern Mexico	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Groundwater flow cross-sectional modeling in combination with major ion and trace element chemistry, stable isotopes of water (O-18 and H-2) and geochemical modeling were used to investigate the origin and evolution of groundwater in a Quaternary lacustrine clay-rich aquitard in the closed basin of the 'La Laguna Region', Northern Mexico. This study pertains to the Viesca Lake, one of a series of ephemeral ancient lakes that existed in this basin until the early 1900s. The Viesca aquitard overlies a regional marine Mesozoic sequence that outcrops in the surrounding mountains. Groundwater samples were collected from springs, pumping wells in a carbonate aquifer and from former industrial production wells in the aquitard. Numerical results indicate a classical gravity flow system, where the carbonate aquifer discharged about 90% of the groundwater, as springs, that fed the former Viesca Lake. Isotope content of groundwater, in the carbonate aquifer, shows that groundwater has a local meteoric origin; and its chemical evolution is mainly associated to progressive dissolution of gypsum and oxidation of pyrite along the flow paths. In contrast, groundwater in the aquitard presented enrichment of heavy isotopes 2 H and 180, indicating that this water resulted from the evaporation of the carbonate groundwater aquifer. The maximum concentrations of sulfate (77,700 mg L-1), chloride (45,400 mg L-1) and sodium (45,000 mg L-1) in the groundwater from the aquitard were between three and four orders of magnitude greater than the fresh groundwater. Sulfate behaved as a conservative ion, contrasting with concentration of sulfate in groundwater from other aquitards in the world; which is usually reduced. Chemical patterns and enrichment of stable isotopes in groundwater from the aquitard follow general evaporation trends observed for other closed or semi-closed basins worldwide. Redox related parameters (NO3-N, NH4+, Mn2+, total Fe and TOC) and redox-sensitive trace elements (As, Se, Sb, Sn, Cr, and Bi) in groundwater indicated dominant aerobic conditions in the carbonate aquifer and anaerobic conditions in the clayey aquitard.

J	Miura, K; Ban, M; Ohba, T; Fujinawa, A				Miura, Kotaro; Ban, Masao; Ohba, Tsukasa; Fujinawa, Akihiko			Sequence of the 1895 eruption of the Zao volcano, Tohoku Japan	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The most recent major eruption event of the Zao volcano comprised a series of phreatic eruption episodes on 15 and 19 February, 22 August, and 27-28 September 1895, with several precursory vulcanian eruptions during February-July 1894. All were generated at the Okama crater lake located inside the Umanose caldera. The eruption products consist mainly of hydrothermally altered ash with altered blocks, except for ash from 1984. The eruption deposits of 1895 are divided lithologically into six layers (1-6). Comparison of the document with the lithofacies of deposits shows that layers 1, 2, 3-4, and 5-6 were correlated respectively with eruption episodes of 15 February (episode 1), 19 February (episode 2), 22 August (episode3), and 27-28 September (episode 4). During these four episodes, ca. 0.5%, 0.5%, 1.5%, and 98% of the total mass of the products had been discharged. Based on lithologic, stratigraphic, granulometric, and component analyses and on distributional features for these layers, the following depositional mechanisms were inferred. Layers 1, 3, and 4 were formed mainly from their related small pyroclastic density currents, whereas layer 2 resulted mainly from a small pyroclastic fall. In contrast, layers 5 and 6 are larger-scale near-vent pyroclastic fall deposits from ash clouds and eruption clouds, which might have included some juvenile fragments. The three early episodes in 1985 led to the climactic episode of 27-28 September. Furthermore, the andesitic magma chamber at <3 kb depth, which caused the 1894 vulcanian eruptions, became a hydrothermal alteration source for the 1895 erupted materials. The chamber was re-activated before 1895 eruption by injection of basaltic magmas from greater depth. The injection reached maximum at the climactic event. The inferred course of that series of eruption episodes provides useful information to predict future volcanic phreatic-type eruptions at this volcano. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Ponds contained 0-465 kg ha(-1) of common carp. We measured limnological variables at weekly intervals for four weeks in early summer, after which ponds were drained and the biomass of fish and macrophytes was determined. Common carp biomass was significantly positively correlated with chlorophyll a, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and Keratella spp. density and negatively correlated to bushy pondweed (Najas guadalupensis) biomass. In addition, we combined our data with data from comparable studies to develop more robust regression models that predict the biomass-dependent effects of common carp on water quality variables across a wide range of systems.

In this study, we investigated the seasonal occurrence, removal, emission, and environmental risk assessment (ERA) of 32 antibiotics and metabolites at four WWTPs located in Wuhu, China. The main findings of this study are as follows: Ofloxacin concentrations dominated all WWTPs, and large quantities of sulfachinoxalin were only detected in WWTP 2 treating mixed sewage. The average apparent removal of individual parent antibiotics or metabolites ranged from -94.7 to 100 %. There was a noticeable seasonal emission pattern (independent t-test, t = 9.89, p < 0.001), with lower emissions observed during summer. WWTPs discharged 85.2 & PLUSMN; 43.8 g of antibiotics and metabolites each day. Approximately 87 % of emissions were discharged into the mainstream of the Yangtze River, while the remainder were discharged into its tributary, the Zhanghe River. The total emissions of 21 parent antibiotics were approximately 18 % of the prescription data, indicating that a considerable and alarming amount of prototype drugs entered the receiving water body. Based on the risk quotient (RQ) of the ERA, the Zhanghe River has a moderate risk of ofloxacin (RQ = 0.111-0.583), a low or insignificant risk of sulfamethoxazole (RQ = 0.003-0.048), and an insignificant risk of other antibiotics or metabolites. However, the risk of antibiotics or metabolites in the mainstream of Yangtze River is insignificant. This study could help understand the seasonal emission patterns of antibiotics and metabolites, as well as more antibiotics sensitive of environmental risks in tributary than that in mainstream.

J	Leydecker, A; Melack, JM				Leydecker, A; Melack, JM			Estimating evaporation in seasonally snow-covered catchments in the Sierra Nevada, California	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												We used Morton's CRAE model, a simple model based on the complementary or advection-aridity relationship, to estimate annual evaporation for six alpine and sub-alpine catchments in the central and southern Sierra Nevada for periods of four to six years. Ten-day averages of air temperature, dew-point and sunshine duration were used as input. Modeled winter evaporation compared well with mean-profile calculations at the meteorological stations, and average annual totals were similar to those calculated from water balances and the evaporative concentration of conservative ions, i.e, chloride and sulfate. Regression relationships between weather stations were used successfully to extend limited meteorological data. Using standard lapse rates to provide data for catchments without weather stations was less successful, but still useful. The average annual catchment evaporation estimated by the model was similar to 36% of annual precipitation (the average water balance and evaporative concentration estimates were 31 and 38%, respectively), showing that annual evaporative loss in the Sierra Nevada is appreciable.

These animals are particularly well represented in Romania; they probably are expansive offshoots of a fauna formerly inhabiting the hugh brackish or freshwater lakes which covered most of this country during the Neogene (and especially the Sarmatian). Different species are inhabitants of different particular habitats of the underground water realm, and the author distinguishes between species inhabiting cave waters, typical phreatobionts, hyporheic species and species living in springs of springbooks. These species are sensitive indicators of even small changes affecting the abiotic or biotic conditions prevailing in their habitats (several examples are offered, especially of competitive exclusion).																			0392-6672	1827-806X					1978	9	3-4					221	233		10.5038/1827-806X.9.3.2	http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1827-806X.9.3.2													WOS:A1978FS66500002

Do two-trait models show different patterns of covariation than multi-trait models? Is covariation different for males and females? Is covariation among traits within populations (many generations) different to that among populations (one generation)? Organism: A sexually dimorphic medium-sized freshwater fish, yellow perch (Perca flavescens). Study system: Over 70 lakes in central North America. Methods: Fish older than young-of-the-year were collected using standardized autumn surveys. Mean life-history traits were calculated for each population by sex. Conclusions: Life-history traits generally covaried in the predicted manner among populations. Traditional two-trait comparisons resulted in similar conclusions as more complex models of covariation. Male and female patterns of covariation differed substantially for relationships between growth and age/size at maturation, moderately for lifespan and age at maturation, but were similar for size at maturation and maximum size. The relationships between female growth rate and maturation depended on the cause of variability in growth rates. Slow-growing populations matured young and small in warm lakes but old and large in cold lakes. Patterns of covariation in life-history traits were similar for temporal and spatial variability in traits.

In this study, the different occurrence patterns and causes of the clear-water phase (CWP) were investigated using water quality and hydrological factors at four sites in Lake Paldang. Among the environmental and other factors associated with CWP occurrence, secchi depth and turbidity exhibited significant correlations with precipitation, hydraulic retention time (HRT), and individual and relative abundance (RA) of zooplankton (Cladocera) (p < 0.01). Hence, a change in the HRT because of precipitation could alter the CWP. The Cladocera individuals and RA showed significant correlations with the water temperature, indicating that the emergence of Cladocera in spring as the water temperature rises could cause the CWP. Sensitivity assessments conducted using Bayesian models demonstrated different CWP occurrence sensitivity relationships for the river-type, lake-type, and shallow and deep sites. Turbidity, secchi depth, and zooplankton factors also showed sensitive relationships with CWP occurrence for all sites. The sensitivity to precipitation and HRT was higher in the river-type sites. The lake-type sites, with common Cladocera emergence and long HRT, favored CWP occurrence. Thus, CWP occurrence was dependent on the site characteristics and climate conditions.

Average concentrations of alpha-HCH and gamma-HCH in ocean surface water were 4.7 +/- 0.9 and 0.44 +/- 0.11 ng/l, respectively. These alpha- and gamma-HCH levels are similar to 66-104% and 54-72% of values reported for the central Arctic Ocean at the Canadian Ice Island in 1986. Mean atmospheric concentrations of alpha-HCH and gamma-HCH(-1.4 +/- 16 and 9.8 +/- 1.3 pg/m(3)) were 2-3 times lower than summer Arctic levels in the 1980s. The ocean surface water (-1.4 degrees C) was approximately within Henry's law equilibrium with respect to atmospheric gamma-HCH levels. Water/air fugacity ratios were 1.03 for gamma-HCH and 1.57 for alpha-HCH, indicating a slight potential for volatilization of alpha-HCH. The two alpha-HCH enantiomers in air and water were separated by chromatography on a gamma-cyclodextrin capillary column. The enantiomeric ratio (ER = ratio of (+)alpha-HCH/(-)alpha-HCH) in air was 1.00 +/- 0.04. This agrees excellently with ER = 1.00 +/- 0.01 found for a racemic alpha-HCH standard. The (+) enantiomer was depleted in seawater, resulting in ER = 0.93 +/- 0.06 in Resolute Bay. ERs of samples from Amituk Lake on Cornwallis Island ranged from 0.65 to 0.99, depending on location, date and relative contributions of fresh snowmelt and older lake water. These results suggest that microbial degradation of HCHs is taking place in Arctic lakes and near-shore marine waters.

J	KRAFT, CE				KRAFT, CE			PHOSPHORUS REGENERATION BY LAKE-MICHIGAN ALEWIVES IN THE MID-1970S	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												A bioenergetics model of fish growth was used to estimate phosphorus (P) cycling by the population of Lake Michigan alewives Alosa pseudoharengus in the mid-1970s. The mean annual standing stock of alewives during the mid-1970s contained 1,500 tonnes of phosphorus, representing a substantial pool of particulate phosphorus unavailable to algae. An estimated 12,000 tonnes of phosphorus were egested and excreted annually by the Lake Michigan alewife population. Over half of the alewife-regenerated phosphorus was produced by larvae and age-0 alewives, which inhabit the nearshore epilimnion during summer. Seasonal aggregations of alewives-the dominant component of the Lake Michigan fish community during the mid-1970s-could have served as an important medium of phosphorus regeneration in comparison with more traditionally reported vehicles such as zooplankton. Expressed volumetrically, alewives regenerated 0.22 mug P . L-1 . d-1 during August, which is comparable to phosphorus regeneration rates previously estimated for Lake Michigan zooplankton. Use of a bioenergetics model provided a means to demonstrate that alewives played a substantial role in Lake Michigan phosphorus regeneration during the mid-1970s.																			0002-8487					SEP	1993	122	5					749	755		10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0749:PRBLMA>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0749:PRBLMA>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1993MJ44000010

The 2009 Red River spring flood is selected as a case study and this approach is tested with the regional climate model, Global Environment Multiscale (GEM) version 4.8 with 10 km resolution, and Canadian Digital Surface Model (CDSM) elevation (similar to 20 m). To investigate the impacts of fluvial inundation on regional climate, the sensitivity experiments using different initial conditions for soil moisture are conducted with 1 km resolution through a three-step one-way nesting approach. Generally, new approach can capture the development-decay of fluvial inundation, similar to MODIS observation. The reasonable statistic values (probability of detection, 0.71; false alarm ratio, 0.26) are found on April 15-22 when occurred the largest MODIS-observed fluvial inundation. In sensitivity experiments, the increase of soil moisture by flooding can induce the decrease of albedo, leading to the increase in absorbed solar radiation energy at surface. Most of the absorbed energy is used by the latent heat flux, inducing the temperature cooling and moisture increase. These changes are larger in daytime than nighttime and are statistically significant in only 2 months (May-June) from the flooding, which contribute to the improvement of temperature simulation. The significant decrease and increase of precipitation in northeastern and southeastern regions away from the flooded region, respectively, are noted post-flooding. These changes are closely associated with the decrease and increase of moist static energy by moisture divergence and convergence, respectively.																			0177-798X	1434-4483				JUL	2020	141	1-2					699	714		10.1007/s00704-020-03224-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-020-03224-1		MAY 2020											WOS:000531795900001

An 18.6 m long drilling core (1Fs) from Lake Qinghai provides new information on the hydroclimatic dynamics since the last glacial period. Here, we present the results of bulk mineral assemblages of this core. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results showed that the bulk minerals of the core sediments consist of major clastic minerals (e.g., quartz, feldspar, muscovite), carbonates (e.g., calcite, aragonite, dolomite), and minor clay minerals (e.g., chlorite). Quartz as an exogenous detrital mineral in lake sediments, its abundance is related to lake level changes resulting from regional climate changes via fluvial/aeolian transportation. Aragonite was precipitated from water solutions or chemical alteration of pre-existing minerals or biogenic mediation, closely related to lake hydroclimate change. Mineral assemblages revealed remarkable stepwise hydroclimatic changes. High quartz content and low calcite without aragonite suggested a cold-wet climate condition under predominant westerlies during the last glacial period from 35 to 25.3 ka. Afterward, quartz decreased and aragonite occasionally appeared, indicating an unstable hydroclimatic condition during the last deglaciation. Since the Early Holocene (11.9-8.2 ka), predominant minerals shifted from terrigenous quartz to authigenic carbonates, suggesting an increasing lake level, possibly due to intensified Asian summer monsoon with increased effective moisture. Aragonite became the primary carbonate mineral, implying a warming and humid hydroclimate environment with a relatively higher lake-level. During the Middle Holocene (8.2-4.2 ka), aragonite showed a decreasing trend indicating a higher lake level with weak evaporation. During the Late Holocene since 4.2 ka, there were lower quartz and aragonite, suggesting a deep lake with a weak summer monsoon. Our quartz and carbonate minerals record provided essential clues to reconstruct hydroclimate change in Lake Qinghai since the last glacial period.

J	Greenlaw, JS; Sheehan, WJ				Greenlaw, JS; Sheehan, WJ			The current status and history of Ring-Billed Gulls (Larus delawarensis) in Maine	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												The Ring-billed Gull (Larus delawarensis) experienced a significant contraction of its range from the Great Lakes eastward during the nineteenth century, but it staged a remarkable recovery in the late twentieth century that continues to the present. A rapid increase in population size in Maine, indexed by Christmas Bird Counts and field sighting data, occurred from the early 1970s through the 1990s. The timing of population growth in Maine closely paralleled the growth and spread of breeding populations along the St. Lawrence River in Quebec, and eastward into the Maritimes. At this time, Ring-billed Gulls also began to appear in greater numbers during summer on interior lakes in Maine. Breeding colonies are now known on two inland lakes.																			1092-6194						2003	10	1					55	66		10.2307/3858672	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3858672													WOS:000182408700005

An introduction to the Dorset special issue: transforming understanding of factors that regulate aquatic ecosystems on the southern Canadian Shield	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												This special issue demonstrates that aquatic ecosystems on the south- central Canadian Shield have changed in many ways over the last three decades. El Ni (n) over tildeo cycles have synchronized multilake dynamics in lake- water chemistry and in several components of the aquatic biota. Overlain on this cyclic regional pattern, phosphorus, sulphate, and calcium levels have all declined, whereas alkalinity has not yet risen in the most acid- sensitive study lakes, despite large reductions in SO2 emissions. Further, novel and unanticipated stressors have appeared, including nonindigenous predator introductions, Ca decline, salinity increase, and autumn spikes in metals following El Ni (n) over tildeo induced droughts. The resident biota are clearly responding not only to the familiar historical phosphorus and acid stressors, but also to the interactive effects of changes in multiple stressors in a warming environment. Lakes are best managed with an understanding of dominant limnological trends, their causes, and their responses to past management interventions. The research conducted at the Dorset Environmental Science Centre indicates "progress but no cigar" on acid rain, proof of climate variability as a direct and indirect regulator of south- central Shield ecosystems, and the emergence of novel stressors, the effects of which we cannot yet fully predict.

J	Carling, PA; Su, T; Meshkova, L				Carling, Paul A.; Su, Teng; Meshkova, Lyubov			Distribution of Devensian glacial erratics and related evidence elucidate complex ice flow changes across a former ice divide: Northern England	PROCEEDINGS OF THE GEOLOGISTS ASSOCIATION												The Lune Gorge and the uplands of the southern Shap Fells represent a key area in developing an understanding of the dynamics of the Late Devensian glaciation (Dimlington Stadial) of northern England. Here ice masses emanating from southern Scotland, the Lake District and the Howgill Fells interacted in the area of the upper Lune valley. Glacial landforms are recorded and tills noted. The dispersal pattern of Shap granite (Sg) erratics is mapped as these clasts are an important tracer of regional ice movements and local ice dynamics. This new information is synthesised with existing literature to provide an understanding of ice dynamics in an area of complex ice flow history. In particular, the ice flow interactions over an area of the western Pennines and the southern Shap Fells have been defined. Early Dimlington ice flow in the vicinity of the upper Lune valley was easterly. Later a northerly shift in the position of a regionally significant west-east aligned ice divide led to topographic steering of southerly basal ice flows, resulting in the development of a western ice stream (Mint Sg plume) and an eastern ice stream (Lune Sg plume); both flowing south around the massif of the southern Shap Fells. At that time, southerly flow of basal ice over the highest ridges of the Grayrigg massif in the southern Shap Fells was relatively weak. Whereas the western stream extended into the Lancashire lowlands, the eastern ice stream was impeded in the Lune Gorge by ice emanating from Borrowdale which forced northern ice to the eastern side of the Lune Gorge where it was blocked by western flowing Howgill ice; the latter extending as far as just east of Kendal. During the late Dimlington, the ice masses over the Mint valley and the southern Shap Fells largely thinned and retreated to the north and west, with a surge in northerly ice movement within the upper Lune valley that did not override the western Pennines. Local ice dynamics are well-illustrated in the western margin of the Pennines (Crosby Ravensworth Fell - Gaythorne Plain), where the disposition of erratics reflects local late west-to-east weak down-wasting ice flow and the presence of subglacial meltwater drainage channels. However, ice ultimately decayed in situ on Crosby Ravensworth Fell - Gaythorne Plain. Similarly, after complex variable easterly and southerly ice flow during the early Dimlington, there was weak northerly ice flow in the later phase over Birkbeck Fells Common before ice thinned and retreated from Grayrigg Forest. An extensive ice stream, fed by ice emanating from an ice dispersal centre in the eastern Lake District, occupied the large trough of Borrowdale that transverses the southern Shap Fells, but its extension and recession dynamics remain enigmatic.

Hg concentrations in aquatic invertebrates and fish indicated a significant temporal trend associated with regular seasonal water-level manipulation. This includes water level lowering to allow for storage of water during the wet season (summer); a decrease of water levels from September to June providing a setting for flood storage. Hg concentrations in organisms were the highest after flooding. Higher Hg concentrations in fish were observed at the location farthest from the dam. Hg concentrations in water and sediment were correlated. Compared with the reservoirs of United States and Canada, TGR had lower trophic magnification factors (0.046-0.066), that are explained primarily by organic carbon concentrations in sediment, and the effect of "growth dilution". Based on comparison before and after the impoundment of TGR, THg concentration in biota did not display an obvious long-term reservoir effect due to (i) short time since inundation, (ii) regular water discharge associated with water-level regulation, and/or (iii) low organic matter content in the sediment.

Between 1989 and 1993 the hydrology, nutrients, chlorophyll-a, phytoplankton, zooplankton, bacteria, as well as primary and bacterial production were included in a comprehensive limnological survey. The trophic state of the reservoir changed from oligotrophic in 1989 to mesotrophic in 1991, due to several flood events (increased erosion and phosphorus Loading) and increased global irradiation in 1990 and 1991. The re-oligotrophication of 1992 and 1993 coincided with lower annual inflows and global irradiation. Phosphorus concentrations decreased, as did the standing stocks of phytoplankton and crustaceans after a delay of one year. On the other hand, the contribution of microbial groups to biomass and secondary production and the ratio of bacterial production to primary production increased. During the summer all planktonic groups seem to be controlled 'top-down' by grazing of Daphnia longispina, whereas 'bottom-up' control by nutrient loading prevails in the other seasons.																			0003-7214	1365-2087				OCT	1995	44			1			102	107																WOS:A1995TC03800016

The roles of food environment and diet	ESTUARIES												The diet and egg production rate of Acartia tonsa were measured during the thermally stable period between June and October 1995 at four locations in inner and outer Florida Bay. We sought to characterize the role of A. tonsa in the bay's pelagic food web, which has been changing since 1987, when the dominant submerged vegetation began shifting from benthic seagrasses to planktonic algae. At Rankin Lake, a shallow basin on the north side of the inner bay, where extensive seagrass mortality and persistent cyanobacteria blooms have occurred, microplankton biomass was relatively high and dominated by heterotrophic protists and dinoflagellates. Nanoplankton at Rankin Lake, while numerically abundant, usually contributed only a small portion of the biomass. The ingestion rate of A. tonsa in Florida Bay varied independently of food concentration.(i.e., total microplankton biomass), but rates were higher (mean +/- SD = 3.88 +/- 0.73 mu g C copepod(-1) d(-1)) on the north side of the bay than on the south side (0.78 +/- 0.11 mu g C copepod(-1) d(-1)). Microzooplankton and dinoflagellates were important dietary constituents, especially in the vicinity of Rankin Lake. Egg production in this region (mean I SD = 14.2 +/- 7.7 eggs female(-1) d(-1)) was considerably higher than the baywide mean (5.8 +/- 0.81 eggs female(-1) d(-1)), and principal components analysis revealed associations between egg production and both dietary microzooplankton and dinoflagellate biomass. However, although grazing rates were relatively high in the inner bay, A. tonsa removed only 1-6% of the primary production from the water column during the summer and its egg production rates were low relative to typical rates for the species.																			0160-8347					JUN	1998	21	2					328	339		10.2307/1352479	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1352479													WOS:000075335900012

Late Holocene palaeovegetational and environmental changes inferred from organic geochemical proxies in sediments from Pookot Lake, southern India	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The sediments from Pookot Lake situated in the Sahyadri (Western Ghats) of southern India provided a record of palaeovegetation and palaeomonsoon variations during the Late Holocene. The palaeovegetation was reconstructed using the carbon isotopic composition of bulk organic matter (delta C-13(org)) and organic geochemical proxies (C/N ratio, C-org %, N % and CaCO3). The vegetation composition (C-3 and C-4 plants) in the Pookot Lake catchment has changed in response to monsoonal variations. Around 2500 cal. years B.P., the lake had a high water level, increased aquatic plankton activity and abundant C-3 vegetation in its catchment, indicating strong monsoonal conditions. From 2500 to 1000 cal. years B.P., the lake had a lower water level, decreased aquatic plankton activity and increased contribution from C-4 land plants, indicating low rainfall conditions. During 1500 to 1000 cal. years B.P., the contributions from C-3 land plants and aquatic plankton increased, suggesting a moderate rainfall. From 1000 cal. years B.P. to the Present, the abundances of C-3 and C-4 vegetation fluctuated, indicating variations in the monsoonal strength. During the Medieval Warm Period (1000 to 600 cal. years B.P.), the monsoon was strong, but it was weak during the Little Ice Age (600 to 350 cal. years B.P.). From 350 cal. years B.P. to the Present, it has been steady. A similar climatic trend is documented in other palaeovegetation records from geographically different parts of India although spatial variability exists. Archaeological lines of evidence suggest a possible climate-culture link in the region.

Nonhalophilic bacteria were mostly mesophilic and dominated in coastal waters. Most psychrotolerant bacteria were able to grow in the presence of 5-10% NaCl. Heterotrophic bacteria isolated in different regions of the lake were identified to a generic level. The isolates were classified into autochthonous and allochthonous microorganisms on the bases of their distribution pattern in the lake water, halotolerance, and ability to grow at low temperatures.

We used electrofishing gear (AC), experimental gill nets, baited wooden and wire fish traps, trot lines, and a creel census (angler catch) to collect channel catfish during fall for 5-9 years in Ridge Lake, a 5.6 ha experimental research lake in east-central Illinois. Efficiency (100 x catch rate/population size) and size selection was assessed for each gear. Population size was determined from known numbers of marked channel catfish that were stocked and numbers lost to anglers (complete creel census) and surviving at lake draining; no natural reproduction occurred in the lake. Mean capture efficiencies for all gears were low (<1.3%) in all years. Mean catch rates were highest for electrofishing (3.4 fish/gear-h) and angler catch (1.5), but were similar among gears when based on labor costs (person-hours) required to conduct a fall sample. Gill netting and the angler catch were the only gears that reflected annual changes in relative abundance of channel catfish. We compared size distributions of channel catfish from each gear with the distribution obtained at lake draining and found gill netting was the only gear that sampled fish in proportion to their actual abundance. In years when size distributions from each gear were compared with gill net distributions, we found that electrofishing selected for smaller fish in the population, trot line and some fish trap samples were skewed toward larger individuals, and anglers caught fish in close proportion to their actual abundance. Based on these results, we recommend the use of experimental gill nets for sampling channel catfish in impoundments. Angler catch data also may provide useful biological information; however, potential biases of estimating angler catch from creel surveys should be considered before catch data are used in management decisions.																			0892-2284		1-888569-19-0				1999	24						317	328																WOS:000086864000029
J	Adjovu, GE; Stephen, H; Ahmad, S				Adjovu, Godson Ebenezer; Stephen, Haroon; Ahmad, Sajjad			Spatiotemporal Variability in Total Dissolved Solids and Total Suspended Solids along the Colorado River	HYDROLOGY												The Colorado River is a principal source of water for 40 million people and farmlands in seven states in the western US and the Republic of Mexico. The river has been under intense pressure from the effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities associated with population growth leading to elevated total dissolved solid (TDS) and total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations. Elevated TDS- and TSS-related issues in the basin have a direct negative impact on the water usage and the ecological health of aquatic organisms. This study, therefore, analyzed the spatiotemporal variability in the TDS and TSS concentrations along the river. Results from our analysis show that TDS concentration was significantly higher in the Upper Colorado River Basin while the Lower Colorado River Basin shows a generally high level of TSSs. We found that the activities in these two basins are distinctive and may be a factor in these variations. Results from the Kruskal-Wallis significance test show there are statistically significant differences in TDSs and TSSs from month to month, season to season, and year to year. These significant variations are largely due to seasonal rises in consumptive use, agriculture practices, snowmelts runoffs, and evaporate rates exacerbated by increased temperature in the summer months. The findings from this study will aid in understanding the river's water quality, detecting the sources and hotspots of pollutions to the river, and guiding legislative actions. The knowledge obtained forms a strong basis for management and conservation efforts and consequently helps to reduce the economic damage caused by these water quality parameters including the over USD 300 million associated with TDS damages.					; Ahmad, Sajjad/A-2867-2008	Ahmad, Sajjad/0000-0002-9903-9321; Stephen, Haroon/0000-0003-3116-1416; Adjovu, Godson Ebenezer/0000-0003-3169-6410														2306-5338				JUN	2023	10	6							125	10.3390/hydrology10060125	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology10060125													WOS:001014884800001

A population exposed to the continuously cold waters released from the hypolimnion of Canyon Lake (Comal County, Texas) continued to breed well with the summer of 1976. This prolonged breeding season in a thermally altered environment suggested that a thermal cue is important in the termination of the spawning season of E. spectabile in central Texas. Breeding individuals of E. spectabile were exposed to 1 of the following 4 combinations of temperature and photoperiod: 24 C, 14 light (L):10 dark (D); 24 C, 10L:14D; 14 C, 14L:10D; 14 C, 10L:14D. Females exposed to warm treatments had significantly lower gonad weight (GW)/adjusted body weight (ABW) ratios than did females exposed to cold treatments. Females exposed to different photoperiods showed no significant differences in GW/ABW ratios. Males exposed to warm temperatures for 12 days had significantly lower GW/ABW ratios than did males exposed to cold treatments. Photoperiod had no significant effect on male GW/ABW ratios.																			0040-4403						1980	32	2					129	142																WOS:A1980JY14800004
J	Singh, R; Pandey, J				Singh, Rachna; Pandey, Jitendra			Non-point source-driven carbon and nutrient loading to Ganga River (India)	CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY												This study was designed to test whether the atmospheric deposition (AD) significantly influences gross primary productivity (GPP) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) build-up in the Ganga River. We collected data for three consecutive years (2012-2014) along with 37 km river stretch with respect to AD-input of carbon, nutrients, and surface runoff chemistry to relate changes in the river water. We found strong linkages among carbon and nutrients in AD, surface runoff and in the river. The concentration of DOC in the river was highest in the rainy season while those of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dissolved reactive phosphorus were highest in winter. Spatio-temporal changes in DOC indicated dependence on point- and non-point sources and within-system DOC build-up. The GPP in the river increased consistently over time and significantly correlated with AD-N (R-2 = 0.96, p < .001) and AD-P (R-2 = 0.97, p < .001). Basin level extrapolation showed that the Ganga River Basin receives 1.81 Tg organic-C, 2.77 Tg reactive-N, and 130 Gg reactive-P annually through atmospheric deposition. Non-point source contributions of carbon and nutrients to the river were substantially higher than those of point sources. The study has relevance for regional scale carbon and nutrient budgeting and action plans for integrated river basin management.

The Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and the Little Ice Age (LIA) have attracted much attention, but the start and end times and humidity characteristics of these climate stages are still controversial. Here, we present a lacustrine sediment record from the Erxianyan wetland in central China covering a timespan of 1900 years. The pollen, grain size, total organic carbon (TOC) content, total nitrogen (TN) and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C/N) analyses of the sediments derived from the Erxianyan wetland revealed the vegetation and climate changes that have occurred in central China over the past 1900 years. From 70 to 740 CE, the water level was high, the organic matter content of the lake reached a high level, and many plants surrounded the lake. The climate was warm and humid. From 740 to 1150 CE, the forest coverage increased, the fern coverage decreased, and the lake water volume decreased. The climate gradually changed from humid to dry. From 1150 to 1990 CE, the vegetation coverage around the lake decreased, the tree proportion declined, and the proportions of terrestrial herbs and ferns increased. The climate was cold and dry. The climate change characteristics reflected in the EXY profile roughly correspond to the Qin-Han Warm Period and Sui-Tang Warm Period. The MCA was warm and dry, while the LIA was cold and arid. Based on comparisons with other climate records and modern precipitation records, we found that the Erxianyan climate changes over the past 1900 years may have been affected by the combined effects of solar radiation, the El Nin & SIM;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM). These results also confirm the complexity of the climate in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River during the MCA and the LIA.

The observed distributions of plankton and temperature were heavily affected by a strong westerly wind that forced the warm epilimnetic water into the eastern part of the lake. During that situation high abundances of plankton were present only in the eastern part of Lake Constance. At the same time cold, hypolimnetic water depleted of plankton was found at the surface in the western part.

Mean summer total phosphorus, nitrate-nitrogen, Secchi disk depth, total suspended solids, chlorophyll a, and phytoplankton species composition data characterized Pawnee Reservoir during 1968-69 as a high nutrient, relatively clear water environment. Phytoplankton biomass was relatively low, consisting mainly of cyanophytes and non-flagellated chlorophytes. During 1970-73, water clarity was poor, total suspended solids were high, and total phosphorus was lower, but was still greater than 100 mu g l(-1). The 1970-73 phytoplankton biomass was high and was dominated by cyanophytes. Mean summer total phosphorus remained > 100 mu g l(-1), water clarity remained poor, but phytoplankton biomass decreased significantly during 1990-92. The dramatic drop in chlorophyll a and low mean volatile suspended solids indicated that inorganic suspended sediments, rather than phytoplankton, accounted for the majority of the turbidity in 1990-92. In addition to lower phytoplankton biomass, community composition shifted away from buoyancy-regulating cyanophytes toward flagellated chlorophytes. These data suggest that as reservoirs located in agricultural watersheds age, (1) inorganic suspended sediments have a significant effect on the light environment as well as phytoplankton biomass and species composition, (2) the control of phytoplankton biomass and species composition shifts away from nutrients to light and suspended sediments, and (3) there is a 1-2 year lag in the response of phytoplankton biomass to maximum nutrient loading during the trophic upsurge period. Thus, sedimentation has been shown to be a primary determinant of plankton and benthic macroinvertebrate community composition as Pawnee Reservoir aged.																			0018-8158					MAR 14	1997	346						183	192		10.1023/A:1002978302479	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1002978302479													WOS:A1997XR91600014

However, this perception is largely gained by downscaling knowledge from large lakes to their smaller counterparts. Here we show that shallow vegetated lakes (less than 0.6 m), in fact, undergo recurring daytime stratification and nocturnal mixing accompanied by extreme chemical variations during summer. Dense submerged vegetation effectively attenuates light and turbulence generating separation between warm surface waters and much colder bottom waters. Photosynthesis in surface waters produces oxygen accumulation and CO2 depletion, whereas respiration in dark bottom waters causes anoxia and CO2 accumulation. High daytime pH in surface waters promotes precipitation of CaCO3 which is re-dissolved in bottom waters. Nocturnal convective mixing re-introduces oxygen into bottom waters for aerobic respiration and regenerated inorganic carbon into surface waters, which supports intense photosynthesis. Our results reconfigure the basic understanding of local environmental gradients in shallow lakes, one of the most abundant freshwater habitats globally.

However, for midlatitude regions like East Asia with complex terrain, the reliability behind the basic assumptions of the temperature effect and amount effect is based on modern observational data and still remains unclear for past climate. In the present work, we reexamine the two basic effects on seasonal, interannual, and millennial timescales in a set of time slice experiments for the period 22-0 ka using an isotope-enabled atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM). Our study confirms the robustness of the temperature and amount effects on the seasonal cycle over China in the present climatic conditions, with the temperature effect dominating in northern China and the amount effect dominating in the far south of China but no distinct effect in the transition region of central China. However, our analysis shows that neither temperature nor amount effect is significantly dominant over China on millennial and interannual timescales, which is a challenge to those classic assumptions in past climate reconstruction. Our work helps shed light on the interpretation of the proxy record of delta O-18 from a modeling point of view.					; Guan, Jian/ABE-3733-2020; Cheng, Xiaoxiao/ABA-6326-2020	Guan, Jian/0000-0003-3838-5498; , Qingzhao/0000-0003-2866-5322													1814-9324	1814-9332				NOV 16	2016	12	11					2077	2085		10.5194/cp-12-2077-2016	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-2077-2016													WOS:000387984200001

Abundant tanniferous cell inclusions may indicate that the 3-mo period of constant daylight during the Artic summer induced high concentrations of tannins in the leaf tissues, which may have arrested microbial degradation of the litter. Quantified differences in the extent of chloroplast preservation through a vertical section of the lignite suggest that short-term shifts in the depositional environment took place, perhaps influencing the exposure of the leaf tissues to conditions that would either promote or inhibit decomposition.

Satellite estimates generally capture the overall spatial-temporal variation of precipitation over China with relatively better ability in warm seasons than in cold seasons. Meanwhile, satellite precipitation estimates also tend to show better agreement with gauge observations over humid regions than over arid and alpine regions. Analysis of the systematic and random error components suggests that the uncertainties in both TRMM3B42RTV7 and TRMM3B42V7 precipitation estimates are significantly reduced over most parts of China compared to the other three satellite products. Among the five products, the research product TRMM3B42V7 with bias adjustments agrees the most with the gauge observation in terms of spatiotemporal variation, amplitude and pattern of variability, occurrence of rainy events, and probability distribution function of the precipitation amount for different rain rates over most parts of China; the near-real-time product TRMM3B42RTV7 with the application of improved retrieval algorithms and more satellite data performs the second best over most subregions of eastern China. The improvements of TRMM3B42RTV7 without bias adjustments over eastern China relative to CMORPH, PERSIANN, and TRMM3B41RTV7 are encouraging and favorable for the operational applications.					黄, 安宁/K-7473-2019; Yang, Ben/O-8548-2015; Zhou, Yang/H-9582-2018	Zhou, Yang/0000-0002-2945-882X													2169-897X	2169-8996				SEP 27	2016	121	18					10654	10675		10.1002/2016JD025456	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016JD025456													WOS:000385836000020

Modern irrigation leads to depleted natural springs and abandoned traditional canal systems, creating a nexus between climate, water availability, agriculture, and cultural heritage. This work unveils this nexus holistically, from the regional to the local scale, and by considering all the components of the nexus. This is achieved by combining five decades (1974-2024) of satellite data-including declassified HEXAGON KH-9, Copernicus Sentinel-1/2/3, COSMO-SkyMed radar, and PlanetScope's Dove optical imagery-and on-the-ground observations (photographic and drone surveying). The observed landscape changes are categorised as "proxies" to infer the presence of the given land processes that they correlate to. The whole of southern Iraq is afflicted by dust storms and intense evapotranspiration; new areas are desertifying and thus becoming local sources of dust in the southwest of the Euphrates floodplain and close to the boundary with the western desert. The most severe transformations happened around springs between Najaf Sea and Hammar Lake, where centre-pivot and herringbone irrigation systems fed by pumped groundwater have densified. While several instances of run-off and discharge highlight the loss of water in the western side of the study area, similar to 5 km(2) wide clusters of crops in the eastern side suffer from water scarcity and are abandoned. Here, new industrial activities and modern infrastructure have already damaged tens of archaeological sites. Future monitoring based on the identified proxies could help to assess improvements or deterioration, in light of mitigation measures.					; Tapete, Deodato/AAB-7528-2021; Jotheri, Jaafar/E-8827-2016	Tapete, Deodato/0000-0002-7242-4473; 														2073-445X				MAY 7	2025	14	5							1013	10.3390/land14051013	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land14051013													WOS:001497516100001

Studies on the spatiotemporal distribution of EP variability and its teleconnection with meteoro-logical factors are extremely important but lacking in the Taihu Lake basin (TLB). Based on the daily precipi-tation data from 50 hydrological stations in the TLB from 1965 to 2018, we introduced a new circular distribution method to statistically delineate the different flood seasons and assess the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics and future persistence of extreme precipitation indices (EPIs) at different time scales. In addition, geodetector was used to quantify the effects of interactions between meteorological factors on the EPIs changes. The results showed that the EP in the TLB tended to increase significantly (P < 0.05) over the past 54 years, with faster growth in the urban cluster in the northeastern part of the basin. The increase in intensity and maximum precipitation amount was dominant during the plum rain period (PRP), whereas the increase in the number of days of precipitation was dominant during the typhoon period (TP). The scaling exponents reveal that the increasing of EP had long-range correlation at different time scales. Furthermore, the influence of climate factors on EP was nonlinear, and the Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) intensity were the climate factor that played a major role in the variability of the EPIs. The results of this study provide a reference for TLB and other monsoon coastal areas worldwide to cope with extreme climate and develop corresponding strategies.

The SPM variations in the coastal zone are highlighted and related to the freshwater and solid discharges of the river measured in situ at the Arctic Red River station (150 km upstream of the river delta). The correlation between the variations of the river discharge and SPM concentration within the surface layer of the coastal waters is obvious. Rather unexpectedly, both have been slightly but significantly decreasing from 2003 to 2018-2019 and started to increase very recently (2019-2022). This change of regime could be explained by changing winter precipitation and groundwater distribution, progressively accumulating sediments within the thawing permafrost layer and its recent release into the groundwater together with thermokarst lakes' rapid drainage.					; Tarasenko, Anastasiia/AAF-3257-2021	Tarasenko, Anastasia/0000-0001-9749-1974; 													0025-326X	1879-3363				NOV	2023	196								115619	10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.115619	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.115619		OCT 2023						37847967					WOS:001098988300001

J	Flood, B; Wells, M; Dunlop, E; Young, J				Flood, Bryan; Wells, Mathew; Dunlop, Erin; Young, Joelle			Internal waves pump waters in and out of a deep coastal embayment of a large lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Large internal waves are a ubiquitous feature of many thermally stratified lakes, and result in oscillating baroclinic flows that pump water into and out of deep coastal embayments. In the long, narrow, and deep Kempenfelt Bay of Lake Simcoe, we show that stratification and circulation were coupled, so that movements of the thermocline can effectively flush the embayment much faster than hydraulic residence time from river input alone. Internal currents were driven by long-period internal waves and resulted in large horizontal excursion lengths of several kilometers, which could drive exchange of embayment waters with the main basin. If the embayments are long, wide, and deep, Coriolis forces also deflect the internal wave to follow the coastline on the right-hand side in the direction of travel as a Kelvin-type wave, resulting in a net cyclonic circulation in the embayment. This residual counterclockwise flow further facilitated flushing of Kempenfelt Bay. For the summer of 2015, we estimate that forced and free internal wave dynamics alone resulted in a seasonally averaged flushing timescale as short as 17 +/- 6 d for the surface mixed layer, and of 13.5 +/- 5 d for the hypolimnetic waters of Kempenfelt Bay. Kempenfelt Bay is representative of many long, deep, and narrow embayments found in the Laurentian Great Lakes and arctic fjords. The exchange processes investigated here are relevant for determining the dynamics of water quality parameters used as indicators to evaluate lake health and fish habitat.					; Dunlop, Erin/HGA-8508-2022	Flood, Bryan/0000-0003-3943-1935; wells, mathew/0000-0003-3838-9202; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				FEB	2020	65	2					205	223		10.1002/lno.11292	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11292		AUG 2019											WOS:000481559500001

The study was conducted in a 2266 hectare, glacially formed, eutrophic lake in northwestern Iowa during the summers of 1987 and 1988. Study sites were divided into 3 depth zones, and fishes were collected by seining (0-1 m), plexiglass traps (1-2 m), and a nonclosing Tucker trawl (2-3 m). Species richness and total fish abundance were consistently greater in natural than in developed sites in both nearshore (0-1 m) and intermediate (1-2 m) depth zones, but differed little between natural and developed sites in the offshore (2-3 m) depth zone. Nearly 50% of the species sampled, including yellow perch Perca flavescens and bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, inhabited limnetic areas as larvae before migrating inshore as juveniles. Eighteen of the 20 fish species collected as juveniles were in greater abundance in natural than in developed sites. Smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieui was the only game species consistently found in equal or greater abundance in developed sites. Within all sites, juvenile fishes were generally most abundant where macrophyte abundance and species richness were greatest. Findings from this study demonstrate the importance of nearshore aquatic vegetation to fishes during their first summer of life. If nearshore vegetation beds of lakes continue to be regarded as a nuisance and indiscriminately removed, important fish nursery habitat will be lost. The short-term result will likely be reduced year-class strength of vegetation-dependent species. More importantly, the long-term effects will be changes in fish community richness and composition which will, in turn, alter the lake's fishery.																			0378-1909					DEC	1992	35	4					329	341		10.1007/BF00004984	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00004984													WOS:A1992KB41900001

It contains Pleistocene stromatolites, ooids and silica nodules. The stromatolites were constructed by cyanobacteria in very low-energy lacustrine conditions. The internal structure of the oncoids is complex and subdivided into shells by unconformities. Each unconformity-bounded shell probably represents stromatolite growth during a distinct lacustrine event. Shallower conditions are represented by colloform growth and deeper water by smooth oncoid mat morphology. The unconformities represent hiatuses of unknown duration. At least six stromatolite growth shells are recognized. Silica concretions which may have developed during shallowing lake stages are also present. The lack of clastic material in the carbonate lithologies suggests that the lake waters may have accumulated from collecting rainwater or have been spring fed. The lowest bed of the succession is a saline clay which represents a seasonally flooded salt pan deposited in an arid to semi-arid climate similar to that of today. The overlying carbonates represent sedimentation during a series of transient lacustrine events, representing intermittent wetter periods. Finally, due to progressive aridity, the lacustrine succession was terminated by calcrete development.																			0037-0746					AUG	1991	38	4					591	599		10.1111/j.1365-3091.1991.tb01010.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.1991.tb01010.x													WOS:A1991GB75000003

When sampled in autumn the pyrolysis effluent lake was found to be stratified in three distinct layers, each exhibiting different physicochemical and microbiological characteristics. Although no oxygen was detectable in the whole deposit, aerobic bacteria were shown to predominate among pollutant degraders: in the upper layers about 40-60% degraders of phenolic compounds in heterotrophic microbial communities were found. Neither nitrate-reducers nor sulfate-reducing or methanogenic consortia that degraded benzoate were detectable. However, nitrite-reducing benzoate degraders were found with MPNs ranging from 0.03 to 20/mL. The attempt to identify aerobic isolates from the top layer with the commercially available BIOLOG and API 20NE identification systems revealed their unsuitability for the determination of specific pyrolysis effluent bacteria. Although the aerobic bacteria with specific degradation abilities are not likely to use their abilities under in-situ conditions, they represent a degradation potential which might be useful for aerobic remediation strategies.

Cluster analysis and Principal Components Analysis were used to classify the samples based on their chemical characteristics, revealing that nutrients and specific conductance were the main factors dividing the samples into four groups: young lakes, coastal lakes, larger lakes on the central plateau and smaller, temporary pools.

Aerial Application of Organic Pellets Eliminates Lake Trout Recruitment from a Primary Spawning Reef in Yellowstone Lake	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Invasive Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush in the Yellowstone Lake ecosystem have been gillnetted since 1995 to suppress the population and allow for recovery of native Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri. Although gillnetting is effective (Lake Trout population growth rate lambda <= 0.6 during 2012-2022), the effort only targets free-swimming, age-2 and older Lake Trout. We developed a complementary suppression method using organic (soy and wheat) pellets to cause Lake Trout embryo mortality and reduce recruitment from spawning areas. The entire Carrington Island spawning reef (0.5 ha) was aerially treated with 3.56 and 3.00 kg/m(2) of pellets in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Pellet decomposition caused dissolved oxygen concentrations to decline to lethal levels at 20 cm depth in the substrate, and pellets mostly dissipated from the reef within 12 d. Lake Trout fry trap CPUE was reduced to zero after ice-off each spring after the treatments. Prior to the treatments, 71 fry were captured during 58 trap-nights of effort in 2017-2019. After the treatments, no fry were captured during 273 trap-nights in 2020 and 2021. Lake Trout CPUE in large-mesh gill nets set near Carrington Island in September did not decline during 2017-2021 and fry were again trapped on the reef in spring 2022, suggesting that adults were not deterred from spawning there in the years after the pellet treatments. Complementary methods that increase mortality of prerecruits may allow for a reduction in gill-netting effort and the long-term costs of maintaining Lake Trout population suppression in Yellowstone Lake. Treatment of spawning areas may improve suppression efficiency for Lake Trout and invasive fish populations elsewhere because entire cohorts are targeted while immobile and temporarily concentrated in relatively small areas.					; Poole, Alexis/GZL-0570-2022	Glassic, Hayley/0000-0001-6839-1026; Koel, Todd/0000-0001-6919-5828													0275-5947	1548-8675				APR	2023	43	2					505	516		10.1002/nafm.10872	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10872		MAR 2023											WOS:000943758200001
J	Gu, XZ; Chen, KN; Fan, CX				Gu, Xiaozhi; Chen, Kaining; Fan, Chengxin			Preliminary evidence of effects of Phragmites australis growth on N2O emissions by laboratory microcosms	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Denitrification has been found to play a significant role in the nitrogen (N) biogeochemical cycle of riparian wetland systems; however, there is little understanding of the role of emergent macrophytes in sediment denitrification. In this study, laboratory culture experiments were conducted to examine how Phragmites australis growth affected N2O emissions. Additionally, preliminary investigations into the variability of carbon and available NO3- -N fractions were conducted. The N2O emission rate was quantified based on the high-resolution N2O microprofiles in acetylene-inhibited sediment cores. Seasonal-dependence of N2O emission was remarkable throughout incubation of both P. australis rooted sediments and control with no P. australis, and increased significantly with biomass steady accumulation (p<0.05), reaching a peak emission of 630 +/- 15 mmol N2O m(-2) day(-1) at day 180 (in late autumn) in the P. australis rhizosphere. Simultaneously, N2O emissions were more highly influenced by fine-root biomass, belowground biomass and plant height than total biomass, root activity and relative growth rate in the Spearman rank correlation model. More specifically, based on the strong and significant (p<0.01) positive correlations between hot-water extractable carbon (HWC) and N2O emission flux, the rapid transformation indicated that changes in the HWC (ranging from 720 to 3564 mg kg(-1)) with plant growth could reflect a 14-fold variation in N2O emissions during the growth stage, and that N2O emissions were highly dependent on fine-root biomass and its delivery of organic carbon. The ion exchangeable form NO3-N (IEF-NO3-N) in sediments was found to be the predominant transferable form involved in denitrification, while the iron-manganese oxide form NO3-N (IMOF-NO3-N) can be considered as a potential source of nitrogen for denitrification. This study highlights that emergent macrophyte communities dominate riparian ecosystem denitrification and that the metabolic mechanisms of emergent macrophytes can have positive feedbacks on the HWC fraction and available NO3-N combined with sediment components in rhizosphere sediments.

Our study relates temporal waterbird data to key environmental gradients at catchment scale that have a structural or functional influence on littoral waterbird assemblages at different scales. During two full-year cycles and two additional wintering seasons, the nearshore waterbird assemblages of the Mar Menor coastal lagoon (Murcia Region, SE Spain) were monitored monthly. Several biological indicator variables were related to the anthropogenic environmental gradient in the catchment area. Results showed that there was a strong dependence of waterbird assemblages on the distance to shore, emphasizing the importance of the first 100-m band, in which many species relevant to conservation converge on food resources. Well-preserved shoreline tracts therefore had a clear positive effect on community richness and diversity values, and were correlated with the occurrence of some species. These results clearly support the need for effective protection and restoration measures of such littoral habitats. Specific responses to local disturbing processes were nested within habitat and landscape preferences, supporting the value of aquatic birds as integrative ecological signals in semi-enclosed coastal systems. Moreover, waterbird-based indicators responded positively to environmental improvements both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Population decline of ground-nesting black-bellied whistling ducks (Dendrocygna autumnalis) on islands in southern Texas	SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST												We report nesting success for a population of ground-nesting black-bellied whistling ducks (Dendrocygna autumnalis) for the summers of 2003 and 2004 at a hypersaline lake in southern Texas, and a population decline of 71% between 2002 and 2003. We attribute the population decline to a change in ecology of the lake, specifically, an increase in salinity from cessation of inflow of fresh water in 2000. The increased salinity led to high mortality in ducklings and brood failure due to sodium toxicity. We compared nest success, nest habitat, and nest predation to other reported populations of black-bellied whistling ducks in the northern area of their range.																			0038-4909					JUN	2008	53	2					185	189		10.1894/0038-4909(2008)53[185:PDOGBW]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1894/0038-4909(2008)53[185:PDOGBW]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000257150700006

Predicting and managing eutrophication requires understanding the consequences of precipitation events on algal dynamics. Here, we assessed the influence of precipitation events throughout the year on nutrient and phytoplankton dynamics in a drinking water reservoir from January 2020 to January 2022. Four distinct precipitation patterns, namely early spring flood rain (THX), Plum rain (MY), Typhoon rain (TF), and Dry season (DS), were identified based on rainfall intensity, duration time, and cumulative rainfall. The study findings indicate that rainfall is the primary driver of algal dynamics by altering nutrient levels and TN:TP ratios during wet seasons, while water temperature becomes more critical during the Dry season. Combining precipitation characteristics with the lag periods between algal proliferation and rainfall occurrence is essential for accurately assessing the impact of rainfall on algal blooms. The highest algae proliferation occurred approximately 20 and 30 days after the peak rainfall during the MY and DS periods, respectively. This was influenced by the intensity and cumulative precipitation. The reservoir exhibited two distinct TN/TP ratio stages, with average values of 52 and 19, respectively. These stages were determined by various forms of nitrogen and phosphorus in rainfall-driven inflows and were associated with shifts from Bacillariophyta-dominated to Cyanophyta-dominated blooms during the MY and DS seasons. Our findings underscore the interconnected effects of nutrients, temperature, and hydrological conditions driven by diverse rainfall patterns in shaping algal dynamics. This study provides valuable insights into forecasting algal bloom risks in the context of climate change and developing sustainable strategies for lake or reservoir restoration.

Review of the potentials for implementation of floating solar panels on lakes and water reservoirs	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS												Many places are dealing with the problem of water scarcity, especially in the summer months. This occurs mostly in the dry areas with hot climates that are exposed to intensive solar insolation which are the main driver for the evaporation of water. Some companies that are in charge of water service, and are operating open water res-ervoirs, have developed a solution to cover the water with floating balls to limit the solar insolation and to mitigate the evaporation of water. Another good approach is using floating solar panels for the same cause, which will provide an additional power source. It can enhance the productivity of hydropower plants with reservoirs. An additional benefit of the solution is the amount of the available water surfaces for placing the solar panels, instead of potentially useful areas for other purposes (agriculture, buildings ...). This paper reviews the current development of the technology, potentials, and best practices. It shows that this technology is feasible and can compete with other power sources, considering the cheapest LCOE being 46 USD/MWh for a 50 MW power plant in Uttar Pradesh, India.					; Mimica, Marko/Y-8010-2018; Krajačić, Goran/K-9310-2018	Stunjek, Goran/0000-0002-5470-3663; Mimica, Marko/0000-0001-8907-8725; Matak, Nikola/0000-0002-7601-1772													1364-0321	1879-0690				MAY	2023	178								113237	10.1016/j.rser.2023.113237	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2023.113237		MAR 2023											WOS:000956307600001

The red-rumped cacique, Cacicus haemorrhous (Linnaeus, 1766), is a passerine (Icteridae) that breeds in colonies in different environments. The objective of this study was to evaluate the breeding success of red-rumped cacique in relation to three environments (lake edge, forest and swamp) in which colonies were established in an Atlantic Forest reserve in southeast Brazil. Seven colonies from the three environments were monitored during the breeding season of 2001. Overall probability of nest survival was 40.5%. We found that colonies established in the swamp presented higher nest survival than the others and the ones in the lake edge had lower survival. Nest predation was the most important Cause of nest failure, representing 46.5% of all nest losses. Other failure causes were abandonment and fall of nests, representing 6.6% and 6.1% of the losses, respectively. Red-rumped cacique had higher success breeding in colonies located in the swamp.

GEOCHEMICAL MODEL OF URANIUM ACCUMULATION IN THE SEMIZBAY RIVERBED (NORTHERN KAZAKHSTAN URANIUM ORE PROVINCE)	BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING												The relevance of the research is caused by the need of exploration of cheap uranium sources near potentially uranium ore bearing areas of Northern Kazakhstan based on studying modern processes of migration and accumulation of uranium. The main aim is to propose a geochemical model of leaching, migration and accumulation of uranium in the Semizbay riverbed based on determining water and bottom sediment composition of river and lake reservoirs, and composition of the Zhaman-Koytass massif and its weathering crust as a primal source of uranium.Objects: modern weathering crust of leucogranites of the eastern part of the Zhaman-Koytass massif; bed sediments of the Semizbay river and its tributary Shat river; riverbed spring, river and lake waters of the Semizbay, Selety rivers and Zhamantuz lake; bottom sediments of the Zhamantuz lake.Methods: x-ray analysis, inductively coupled plasma mass spectomerty, x-ray crystalography, classic methods of determination of cation and anion composition.Results. High concentrations of uranium in spring riverbed waters (0,32 mg/l) and artificial reservoir (0,047 mg/l) as well as elevated con-centrations of uranium in riverbed soil (8,6-13 ppm) and bottom sediments of artificial reservoir (23-24 ppm) in the upper course of the Semizbay river were found. Based on the colected data the authors have proposed the geochemical model of uranium leaching from leu-cogranites of the Zhaman-Koytass massif, its migration and accumulation in the Semizbay riverbed, the modern facies of which act as the geochemical barrier on the way of uranium migration to ecosystem of the Ishim steppe. Uranium concentrations in riverbed sediments in lower course of the Semizbay river (1,9-2, 7 ppm), as well as in water (0,0029 mg/l) and bottom sediments (4,6 ppm) of the Zhamantuz lake, which is the final discharge waterbody of the Semizbay river, represent background uranium concentrations in Western Siberia.

We investigated the size and seasonal dynamics of the belowground bud banks of four dominant macrophytes along a small-scale elevational gradient in Dongting Lake wetlands, China. The below-ground bud banks of all four species were found to peak in January, the coldest month of the year. Bud banks were densest for low-elevation Phalaris arundinacea L. (1049 +/- 70 buds m(-2)), intermediate for mid-elevation Carex brevicuspis C.B. Clarke and Polygonum hydropiper L. (565 +/- 52 buds m(-2) and 484 +/- 78 buds m(-2), respectively), and lowest for high-elevation Miscanthus sacchariflorus (Maxim.) Hackel (333 +/- 52 buds m(-2)). Elevation, which reflects stand flooding regimes, explained 85% of the variability in bud bank size among the four species. The bud bank size of Carex brevicuspis, Polygonum hydropiper, and Phalaris arundinacea decreased markedly after the spring sprout, thus indicating that these three species may be sensitive to the timing of disturbance. Bud bank densities for all four species were lowest just before flooding (in May), which might be a strategy to reduce maintenance costs through the flooding season (June-October). Among the four species examined, the bud bank density of Phalaris arundinacea was highest during the growing season, which suggests that this species may be the most resilient to environmental change.

The Present State and Evolution of the Near-Summit Hydrothermal Activity on Ebeko Volcano from 1951 through 2024 (Paramushir Island, Kuril Islands)	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND SEISMOLOGY												This paper is concerned with the present state of the thermal fields in the near-summit part of the active Ebeko Volcano on Paramushir Island (Kuril Islands). We show the area of occurrence, the discharge, and the chemical composition of the main types of water manifestations (pots, lake, springs). All thermal occurrences on the volcano resulted from interaction between volcanic gases on the one hand and the surface and underground waters circulating at small depths on the other; the thermal occurrences have low pH (<3), Cl-SO4 (SO4-Cl) composition in a wide range of temperatures (between 10 and 98 degrees C) and salinity (between 1 and 100 g/L). Based on continuous multiyear observations of the evolution of chemical composition in thermal waters we estimated the response of volcanic events to the state of the hydrothermal system. We showed that changes in the chemical composition of Lake Goryachee are related to changes in the intensity (going as far complete decay) of hydrothermal activity in the Middle Crater. The phreatomagmatic eruption beginning in 2016 might have provoked the resumption of deep fluid flow into the lake, resulting in increased concentrations of Cl- in the water. The pots in the Northeastern Field are the most sensitive to events occurring on the volcano. All periods of increased activity are recorded in the varying concentrations of SO4 (2-)and Cl- and in the relationships between the two after the increase in activity began. However, even the largest pots periodically become steam-gas jets, which impedes regular geochemical monitoring.

For this purpose, a state of art review and calculations were made for the period 1957-2013 using observed hydrological and meteorological data with a water balance approach. Actual evapotranspiration was calculated and validated by empirical formulas. Water storage change analysis was conducted with uncertainty boundaries using a 10-year moving window. Results show that temperature, precipitation, and actual evapotranspiration in the SRYR increased by 0.34 degrees C, 11.4 mm, and 7.6 mm per decade, respectively (significant at 0.05 probability level). Runoff appears to have increased at a rate of 3.3 mm per decade. The SRYR water storage in total has not changed significantly during the period, although the moving average is mostly below zero. Based on the water balance equation, the increase in calculated evapotranspiration is mainly due to the significantly increasing temperature. This in combination with increasing precipitation leads to a relatively stable water storage during the study period. Correlation analyses show that precipitation dominates runoff during the warm season (May to October), while temperature anomalies dominate the runoff during the cold season (November to April). The influence of temperature on runoff seems to enhance during the winter period.

In this study we present a new sedimentological and sequence stratigraphic model for Upper Ordovician glaciogenic deposits based on the analysis of core descriptions and wireline logs from 25 wells in the Tiguentourine Field. Within the glaciogenic succession, two ice advance-retreat cycles can be defined, consisting of glaciomarine ice-contact fan deposits and tillites. Deposits of the marine ice-contact fan systems generally show a retrogradational stacking pattern from ice-proximal to ice-distal deposits. This pattern is attributed to the deposition in front of a retreating ice sheet. The proximal marine ice-contact fan deposits consist of massive or low-angle cross-bedded pebbly sandstone. They are interpreted as the deposits of turbulent, high-energy plane-wall jets, emerging from subglacial meltwater conduits. These jet-efflux deposits are up to 60 m thick and interbedded with deposits of cohesive and non-cohesive debris flows. The jet-efflux deposits are overlain by fine-grained, thick-bedded massive sandstone. These mid-fan deposits build up the bulk of the glaciomarine fans and are interpreted as deposits of underflows, generated at the point of flow-detachment, where marine meltwater jets become buoyant and large volumes of sediment fall-out from suspension. In the upper part of the fan succession massive sandstones pass upwards into mud-prone massive sandstones, interpreted as deposits of cohesive sandy debris flows. The most ice-distal deposits are muddy sandstones and mudstones deposited by waning low-density turbulent flows and suspension fall-out. The best reservoir properties within the glaciogenic succession are attributed to the proximal and medial deposits of the ice-contact fans such as coarse-grained jet-efflux deposits and sustained high-density turbulent flow deposits. However, the mud content within the massive sandstones is highly variable and influences the reservoir quality. Both glacial depositional sequences infill 60-175 m deep, elongated depressions, which are interpreted as subglacial tunnel valleys. These tunnel valleys acted as depocentres for the glaciomarine fan deposits. After final deglaciation and post-glacial transgression, organic-rich shale was preferentially deposited in underfilled tunnel valleys.					; Le Heron, Daniel/AAK-7639-2020; Lang, Joerg/KOC-7485-2024	Huuse, Mads/0000-0002-1766-4343; Lang, Jorg/0000-0002-2582-2874; Le Heron, Daniel/0000-0002-7213-5874; 													0305-8719		978-1-86239-348-6				2012	368						293	317		10.1144/SP368.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/SP368.1													WOS:000342838600016
J	Salvetti, R; Azzellino, A; Vismara, R				Salvetti, Roberta; Azzellino, Arianna; Vismara, Renato			Diffuse source apportionment of the Po river eutrophying load to the Adriatic sea: Assessment of Lombardy contribution to Po river nutrient load apportionment by means of an integrated modelling approach	CHEMOSPHERE												The source apportionment of the annual nutrient load carried by the Po river to the Adriatic sea has been studied. An integrated modelling approach was applied to the Lombardy plain area, which covers about 34% of the Po river watershed area and accounts for about 50% of the point sources' loads carried by the river. To extract all the information available from direct instrearn measurements, two different modelling tools were alternatively used. The source apportionment was investigated considering both dry and wet weather scenarios. In order to quantify the apportionment in dry-weather conditions, the Lombardy portion of the Po river basin was modelled by using the US-EPA QUAL2E model. Such a simulation allowed to assess a significant contribution (about 50% of the total dry-weather load) of a not rain-driven diffuse pollution component (i.e. groundwater, springs, lake emissaries). Moreover, to estimate the rain-driven surface runoff contribution to the instrearn total load, the Lombardy plain area was also modelled by means of the US-DA SWAT model. SWAT results indicate a runoff contribution to the Po river instream total load of about 10 000 t N yr(-1) and 1300 t P yr(-1) (i.e. approximately the 10-20% of the total annual Lombardy nutrient load). At the event scale (i.e. the single rainstorm event) the runoff contribution may rise up to 30-80% of the total instream load. Finally, the total annual nitrogen load at the Po basin closure was estimated for the period 1985-2001. Out of a total annual load of 140000 t N yr(-1), Lombardy accounts for 43% (point plus diffuse sources). The rain-driven diffuse sources constitute the 20% of the overall total load, the point sources account for 40%, whereas the remaining 40% is mainly constituted by "dry-weather diffuse sources" (i.e. groundwater, springs, lake emissaries).

J	Katiyar, SK; Belsare, DK				Katiyar, SK; Belsare, DK			Limnological studies on Bhopal lakes: Fresh water protozoan communities as indicators of organic pollution.	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Rapid organic pollution of three urban lakes of Bhopal city affected the colonization rate of freshwater protozoan fauna. Upper lake had surface water NO3-N of 200-400, 300-600 mu g(-L) during cold and hot seasons respectively. Similarly its PO4-P content was increased almost twice during summer, as compared to that in cold period. In Mansarover lake, reverse trend was found in the case of nutrient status, although it is homothermal. The protozoan colonization rate in both these lakes was high during the hot season and low during the cold season. The lower lake is noticed no remarkable change in NO3-N and PO4-P during cold and hot seasons though it is also homothermal and has constant volume of water. The protozoan colonization of artificial substrate was monitored at each lake site, was correlated with NO3-N and PO4-P. A significant positive correlation was observed in the upper lake and lower lake but the negative correlation was noticed at Mansarover lake.																			0254-8704	2394-0379				JUL	1997	18	3					271	282																WOS:A1997XU84000013

However, knowledge of moisture recycling within many large inland basins and the factors that control moisture recycling is generally lacking. Based on a three-component isotopic mixing model, we assessed the characteristics of moisture recycling in China's semi-arid Heihe River Basin. During the active growing season, almost half of the precipitation in the upper reaches was provided by local moisture recycling, and the main contribution came from transpiration. In the middle reaches, almost half of the precipitation in the artificial oasis and the desertoasis ecotone was also provided by local moisture recycling, and the transpiration fraction (f(Tr)) and evaporation fraction (f(Ev)) of the artificial oasis differed from those of the desert-oasis ecotone. In the lower reaches, less than 25% of the precipitation was provided by local moisture recycling. Mean f(Tr) values were relatively low in the Gobi (15.0%) in the middle reaches and in the riparian forest at Ejina (25.6%) in the lower reaches. The positive correlations between f(Tr) and both precipitation and relative humidity suggest that higher precipitation and relative humidity promote transpiration fraction, whereas higher vapor pressure deficit reduces transpiration fraction. The positive correlation between f(Ev) and temperature and vapor pressure deficit, and the negative correlation between f(Ev) and relative humidity indicate that higher temperature and vapor pressure deficit promotes evaporation fraction, whereas higher relative humidity reduces the evaporation fraction. Our results show that contributions of recycled moisture (especially transpiration) to local precipitation play an important role in regional water resource redistribution in the arid and semi-arid region of northwestern China.

Seven stratigraphic sequences were reconstructed, each containing a series of delta lobes that were formed during former lake-level stillstands or during slow lake-level increase or decrease. The lake level has experienced at least four cycles of stepwise rise and fall of 400m or more. These fluctuations were mainly caused by past changes in the atmospheric circulation pattern. During periods of low lake levels, the Siberian High was likely to be strong, bringing dry air masses from the Mongolian steppe blocking the midlatitude Westerlies. During periods of high lake levels, the Siberian High must have been weaker or displaced, and the midlatitude Westerlies could bring moister air masses from the Mediterranean and North Atlantic regions.

The highest shoreline is at 386 m elevation and was eroded when the White Nile formed a lake as wide as 70 km and >500 km long. Finely laminated green clays laid down on the floor of this lake are overlain by alluvial sands and clays, dated by optically stimulated luminescence as 15 ka to older than 250 ka. The alluvium was deposited during interglacial episodes of stronger summer monsoons and very high White Nile floods. The White Nile paleolake is much older than marine oxygen isotope stage 7 and may have formed ca. 400 ka, during the exceptionally long stage 11 interglacial.

The protective volcanic rim and dense growth of Potamogeton natans provided highly stable thermal conditions throughout much of the year with the thermocline frequently in the top 30 cm of the water column during the summer and dissolved oxygen typically < 3.0 mg l-1 in surface waters and < 1.0 mg l-1 below 50 cm. The microdistribution of both phytoplankton and zooplankton was examined at close intervals (10 cm) throughout the water column with the aid of a peristaltic pump. Aglaodiaptomus leptopus, alone with Dinobryon sertularia and certain diatom species, were largely restricted to the top 30 cm, while the colonial phytoflagellate, Pryobotrys elongata and certain euglenoids were mostly located in the anaerobic lower strata. Cryptomonas obovata demonstrated subsurface maxima at various locations witin the water column depending upon season.

Ice classification and mapping	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												During the 1997 winter season, shipborne polarimetric backscatter measurements of Great Lakes (freshwater) ice types using the Jet propulsion Laboratory C-band scatterometer, together with surface-based ice physical characterization measurements and environmental parameters, were acquired concurrenty with Earth Resource Satellite 2 (ERS-2) and RADARSAT Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. This polarimetric data set, composed of over 20 variations of different ice types measured at incident angles from 0 degrees to 60 degrees for all polarizations, was processed to radar cross-section to establish a library of signatures (look-tip table) for different ice types. The library is used in the computer classification of calibrated satellite SAR data. Computer analysis of ERS-2 and RADARSAT ScanSAR images of Great Lakes ice cover using a supervised classification technique indicates that different ice types in the ice cover can be identified and mapped, and that wind speed and direction can have an influence on the classification of water as ice based on single frequency, single polarization data. Once satellite SAR data are classified into ice types, the ice map provides important and necessary input for environmental protection and management, ice control and ice breaking operations, and ice forecasting and modeling efforts.																			0380-1330					DEC	2007	33	4					736	750		10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[736:SSRSOG]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[736:SSRSOG]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000252473500003

Seasonal Dynamics of Akinetes of Anabaena flos-aquae in the Bottom Sediments and Water Column of a Small Siberian Reservoir	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												Seasonal dynamics of akinetes of Anabaena flos-aquae (Lyngb.) Breb. was Studied in the sediements and the water Column in profundal and littoral zones of a small Siberian reservoir. It was hypothesized that even in a shallow mixed reservoir cyanobacterial bloom initiates in the littoral zone and only then distributes throughout the water body. Two types of akinetes have been recognized: one type ensures vegetative reproduction, and the other, survival during adverse growth conditions. Seasonal dynamics of abundance of akinetes and vegetative cells was quite the same in water column in the littoral and profundal zones. However, there were differences in the seasonal dynamics of abundance of akinetes in the bottom sediments of these two areas: in the central zone the abundance increased throughout the vegetation period, whereas in the littoral zone the abundance decreased after settling of akinetes. During winter, the abundance of akinetes decreased in the sediments in both profundal and littoral zones. The explanation to this fact has not been found yet.

Based on percentage of total volume, 20 of the most important foods are listed. The six most important duck species in the kill were: mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), wood duck (Aix sponsa), widgeon (Mareca americana), pintail (Anas acuta), black duck (Anas rubripes), and green-winged teal (Anas carolinensis). Six plant species made up 5% or more of the total volume of food items found in the stomachs of all ducks. Only seeds of oaks (Quercus sp.), corn, sweet gum (Liquidambar Styraciflua), and buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis) were consumed. Some seed, but mostly the vegetative portions of hydrochloa (Hydrochloa carolinensis) and only the vegetative portions of southern rice cutgrass (Leersia hexandra) were taken. The more important game ducks concentrated on the refuge farmlands when water levels were below 72 feet mean sea level (msl). When levels reached 75 feet msl, natural foods became available, ducks dispersed from refuge areas, and hunting success increased greatly.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1966	30	3					577	+		10.2307/3798750	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3798750													WOS:A19668077000018

The oxygen and hydrogen isotopic ratios of water samples collected from rivers, lakes, springs, and irrigation canals were determined using cavity ring-down spectroscopy. The lake water data deviated from the meteoric line of the Philippines by between 13.5% and 10%, and between 11.5% and 1.5% in the dry and wet seasons, respectively. The values for the groundwaters and surface waters were mainly between 8% and 3% throughout the year. In addition to rainwater, evaporative concentration, which may have an almost constant effect throughout the year, was the main control on the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic properties of Laguna Lake. The contributions of the surface waters and groundwaters to the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic ratios of the lake were relatively constant. Based on their isotopic properties, the waters within the water catchment area of Laguna Lake can be roughly divided into lake water with heavier isotopic ratios, and groundwater and surface water with lighter isotopic ratios.																			2073-4441					MAY	2017	9	5							328	10.3390/w9050328	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w9050328													WOS:000404558100028

Chlorine reacts with the natural organic matter or contaminants in surface waters and produces a complex mixture of disinfection by-products (DBPs), some of which have been shown to be carcinogenic, mutagenic and/or teratogenic in animal studies. To define the potential toxicity on aquatic animals, disinfected drinking waters obtained from a pilot plant fed with water coming from Lake Trasimeno (Perugia) were collected, adsorbed by using silica C-18 cartridges, and then eluted in sequence with ethylacetate, dichloromethane and methanol. The eluates were concentrated under vacuum and resuspended in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Primary cultures of rainbow trout hepatocytes were exposed to three amounts of water concentrate (equivalent to 0.5, 0.25 and 0.1251 of disinfected water per ml of culture medium) for 24 h at 20 degrees C, after which their viability, glutathione content (GSH), free radical production (ROS) and cytochrome P4501A3 expression were determined. The disinfected water samples were collected during different seasons in order to evaluate a possible correlation between seasonal water variations and formation of toxic compounds. None of the water concentrates showed any cytotoxic effect or variations in GSH content, but significant increases in ROS production were detected in the autumn water concentrates from the treatments with sodium hypochlorite and chlorine dioxide. Cytochrome P4501A3 expression was not modified in the hepatocytes exposed to the water concentrates irrespective to the sampling season. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Dana, GL; Davis, RE; Fountain, AG; Wharton, RA Jr				Dana, GL; Davis, RE; Fountain, AG; Wharton, RA Jr			Satellite-derived indices of stream discharge in Taylor Valley, Antarctica	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Temperature indices from NOAA-AVHRR data were developed to predict diurnal and seasonal streamflow in Taylor Valley, Antarctica. Masks of the primary land-cover types (snow, glacier ice, lake ice, and soils) were created from Landsat TM data using binary threshold methods. The masks were then scaled to AVHRR resolution using modal selection of pixels and applied to both diurnal and seasonal time series of AVHRR temperature data from the 1994-95 austral summer season. A temperature area index (TAI) was calculated for different land-cover types, as well as for the entire watershed. The TAI was defined as the number of pixels at or above a specified temperature. Diurnal discharge was well characterized by a linear relationship of streamflow to the TAI using a temperature threshold of 259 K from all land class pixels for lower Taylor Valley. Neither index successfully predicted seasonal discharge, most likely due to the mismatch of time scales between the satellite and streamflow data. The TAI has great potential for predicting diurnal streamflow in both Taylor Valley and other remote areas within the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica.

Constraining modern-day silicon cycling in Lake Baikal	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Constraining the continental silicon cycle is a key requirement in attempts to understand both nutrient fluxes to the ocean and linkages between silicon and carbon cycling over different time scales. Silicon isotope data of dissolved silica (delta Si-30(DSi)) are presented here from Lake Baikal and its catchment in central Siberia. As well as being the world's oldest and voluminous lake, Lake Baikal lies within the seventh largest drainage basin in the world and exports significant amounts of freshwater into the Arctic Ocean. Data from river waters accounting for similar to 92% of annual river inflow to the lake suggest no seasonal alteration or anthropogenic impact on river delta Si-30(DSi) composition. The absence of a change in delta Si-30(DSi) within the Selenga Delta, through which 62% of riverine flow passes, suggests a net balance between biogenic uptake and dissolution in this system. A key feature of this study is the use of delta Si-30(DSi) to examine seasonal and spatial variations in DSi utilization and export across the lake. Using an open system model against deepwater delta Si-30(DSi) values from the lake, we estimate that 20-24% of DSi entering Lake Baikal is exported into the sediment record. While highlighting the impact that lakes may have upon the sequestration of continental DSi, mixed layer delta Si-30(DSi) values from 2003 and 2013 show significant spatial variability in the magnitude of spring bloom nutrient utilization with lower rates in the north relative to south basin.					; Swann, George/B-2794-2011; Vologina, Elena/A-6414-2014; Alleman, Laurent/T-2038-2019	Horstwood, Matthew/0000-0003-4200-8193; Andre, Luc/0000-0002-7286-0072; Alleman, Laurent/0000-0003-4165-1742; Swann, George/0000-0002-4750-9504; Mackay, Anson/0000-0002-6328-769X; Panizzo, Virginia/0000-0002-3411-9945													0886-6236	1944-9224				MAR	2017	31	3					556	574		10.1002/2016GB005518	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016GB005518													WOS:000400695400007

The research was carried out in autumn 2008, after growing season. Inorganic nitrogen compounds were determined by adding 1 % K2SO4 after incubation of soil samples. Furthermore, the redox potential (Eh) and the oxygen diffusion rate (ODR) were measured and rH factor was calculated. The results show that the most beneficial soil-site conditions for the mineralization of organic nitrogen compounds are in deluvial soils in the landscape of lakeland hills. In these soils the amount of nitrogen compounds converted to inorganic forms was the highest and the content of N-NO3 was low and medium according to the established standards. The value of Eh potential amounted to 390 mV and the oxygen diffusion rate to 74.2 mu m(-2) s(-1). The N-NO3 : N-NH4 ratio exceeded 1.0. In surface horizons of alluvial soils of riverine and delta landscapes, despite higher quantities of organic matter and total nitrogen than in deluvial soils, the amounts of inorganic nitrogen compounds were similar. In subsurface horizons of alluvial soils, small amounts of inorganic nitrogen compounds were released and the N-NO3 : N-NH4 ratio was below one. Different site conditions, in which process of mineralization of organic nitrogen compounds took place, led to statistically significant differences between deluvial and alluvial soils, taking into consideration the content of N-NO3 and the sum of N-NO3 and N-NH4.																			1898-6188	2084-4530					2009	16	8					971	981																WOS:000420263000009
J	Willett, SD; Schlunegger, F; Picotti, V				Willett, Sean D.; Schlunegger, Fritz; Picotti, Vincenzo			Messinian climate change and erosional destruction of the central European Alps	GEOLOGY												At the end of the Miocene, the European Alps ceased outward expansion, and tectonic uplift and exhumation shifted into the orogen interior. This shift is consistent with a change from orogenic construction to orogenic destruction, reflecting an increase in the ratio of erosional flux to accretionary flux. The coincidence of this change with an increase in sediment yield from the Alps suggests a climate-driven increase in erosional flux. The timing of deformation and sediment release from the southern Alps indicates that the tectonic change occurred synchronous with the last phase of the Messinian salinity crisis. We attribute the increase in erosional flux to a climatic shift to wetter conditions throughout Europe, likely augmented by the base-level fall that occurred during the Mediterranean dessication. This climate change is represented in the stratigraphic record by the Lago Mare deposits of the Mediterranean salinity crisis.

Several samples of both species were collected in different seasons and raised in the laboratory at various temperatures and their habitats, morphology, karyology (2n = 34) and breeding behaviour were compared. The results of cross-breeding experiments are given, with most of the F1 offspring showing a range of patterns of colouration, gut branching and fecundity which were intermediate to those of the parent species. However, crossbreeding also resulted in a small proportion of abnormalities among the F1, and especially the F2, generations, indicating an incomplete reproductive compatibility, but supporting the hypothesis of their common origin. An emended description of Dugesia salina (Whitehouse, 1914), is also given together with karyological data (2n = 16) from material collected from a saline spring, En Sheva (Tabgha), situated on the north-western shore of Lake Kinneret.

Riparian buffers maintain aquatic trophic structure in agricultural landscapes	BIOLOGY LETTERS												Local and regional habitat conditions associated with agricultural activity can fundamentally alter aquatic ecosystems. Increased nutrient inputs, channelization and reduced riparian habitat both upstream and locally contribute to the degradation of stream ecosystems and their function. Here, we examine stream food webs in watersheds that feed into Lake Erie to determine the effects of agricultural land cover on major food web energy pathways and trophic structure. Given that higher agricultural intensity can increase nutrient runoff and reduce the riparian zone and litter in-fall into streams, we predicted that generalist fish would derive less energy from the terrestrial pathway and become more omnivorous. Consistent with these predictions, we show that both mean terrestrial energy use and trophic position of the resident top consumer, creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), decrease with local agricultural intensity but not with watershed-level agriculture intensity. These findings suggest that local riparian buffers can maintain trophic structure even in the face of high whole-watershed agricultural intensity.

Lake-atmosphere diffusive gas exchange is dependent on the concentration gradient between air and surface water and also on the gas transfer velocity, often described with the gas transfer coefficient k. We used the floating-chamber method in connection with surface water gas concentration measurements to estimate the gas transfer velocity of CO2 (k(CO2)) and CH4 (k(CH4)) weekly throughout the entire growing season in two contrasting boreal lakes, a humic oligotrophic lake and a clear-water productive lake, in order to investigate the earlier observed differences between Icco, and k(CH4). We found that the seasonally averaged gas transfer velocity of CH4 was the same for both lakes. When the lakes were sources of CO2, the gas transfer velocity of CO2 was also similar between the two study lakes. The gas transfer velocity of CH4 was constantly higher than that of CO2 in both lakes, a result also found in other studies but for reasons not yet fully understood. We found no differences between the lakes, demonstrating that the difference between k(CO2) and k(CH4) is not dependent on season or the characteristics of the lake.

J	Gavin, DG; Brubaker, LB; Greenwald, DN				Gavin, Daniel G.; Brubaker, Linda B.; Greenwald, D. Noah			Postglacial climate and fire-mediated vegetation change on the western Olympic Peninsula, Washington (USA)	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												The mode and tempo of forest compositional change during periods of rapid climate change, including the potential for the fire regime to produce nonlinear relationships between climate and vegetation, is a long-standing theme of forest ecological research. In the old conifer forests of the coastal Pacific Northwest, fire disturbances are sufficiently rare that their relation to climate and their ecological effects are poorly understood. We used a 14 700-year high-resolution sediment record from Yahoo Lake on the Olympic Peninsula, Washington, USA, to examine vegetation (landscape vegetation from pollen and local vegetation from macrofossils) and fire (landscape fire from total charcoal and local fire from charcoal peaks) in conjunction with independent records of climate. We hypothesized that the successional stage of the local forest will exhibit alternate stable states over a range of fire activity, that species turnover will increase abruptly above a certain level of fire activity and that both responses would be more gradual at the landscape scale than the local scale. Supporting these hypotheses, at the local scale, we found strong evidence for alternate stable states of late vs. early successional communities and inertia of species turnover to changing fire activity. At the landscape scale, vegetation responded more gradually to changing fire activity. From 14 700 to 7000 years ago, high landscape vegetation turnover occurred along with high landscape fire activity, especially during the warm summers of the early Holocene. In several instances, local species turned over completely following fire events but several centuries after climate change. In contrast, during the last 7000 years, the local forest composition was dominated by late-successional species with little species turnover, despite periods of moderate fire activity. We suggest that the relatively minor climate fluctuations of the past 7000 years were not sufficient to cause large-scale species turnover after fire. The Yahoo Lake fire and vegetation record of the early Holocene provides a model for dramatic ecosystem change following an anticipated shift to warmer summer temperatures.

J	OKLAND, J				OKLAND, J			EFFECTS OF ACIDIC WATER ON FRESH-WATER SNAILS - RESULTS FROM A STUDY OF 1000 LAKES THROUGHOUT NORWAY	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												This paper summarizes some results from a monograph which focused on ecological and biogeographical aspects of the biota in Norwegian lakes and rivers with particular reference to the snail fauna. Field studies were made in the course of 20 summers within the period 1953-87. Acidic water is the main reason why snails are absent from some 4000 lakes in a low-calcium area in southern Norway (`Acid south'). This area is heavily influenced by acidic precipitation. Snails were not detected in lakes with pH below 5.2. In one lake, three snail species disappeared in parallel with acidification from pH 5.2 to 4.2. The calcium level modified the effect of low pH.																			0269-7491	1873-6424					1992	78	1-3					127	130		10.1016/0269-7491(92)90020-B	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0269-7491(92)90020-B								15091938					WOS:A1992JG10700019
J	Kilibarda, Z; Kilibarda, V				Kilibarda, Zoran; Kilibarda, Vesna			Foredune and Beach Dynamics on the Southern Shores of Lake Michigan during Recent High Water Levels	GEOSCIENCES												From 18 January 2013 (175.16 m a.s.l.) to 8 September 2020 (177.82 m a.s.l.), Lake Michigan experienced its fastest and highest rise (2.67 m) since 1860, when instrumental measurements began. Extensive foredunes developed since the last high lake levels began eroding in 1997 at fast rates. This study focuses on coastal morphodynamics along the 800 m coast within the central Indiana Dunes State Park on Lake Michigan's southern shores during this time. Severe foredune erosion, in terms of total horizontal dune loss and total volume of eroded sand, occurred unevenly over the three-year period, both temporally, during a single storm, a season, a year, or three years, and spatially, in the eastern, central, and western study areas. Late autumn storms accounted for most foredune erosion in 2018 and 2019, when foredune scarps retreated up to 4 and 9 m, respectively. Erosion was highest in the updrift eastern study area, where about 8 m(3)/m of sand was removed in 2018 and about 19 m(3)/m of sand was removed in 2019. The lack of shelf ice along the shore, rising lake levels, and convective storms that triggered meteotsunamis changed the foredune erosion pattern in 2020. Erosion became most vigorous in the downdrift central (13 m scarp retreat) and western (11 m scarp retreat) study areas. The average volume of eroded sand (21.5 m(3)/m) was more than double that of 2019 (8 m(3)/m), and almost quadruple the 2018 volume (5.5 m(3)/m). After foredune erosion events, the beach rapidly recovered and maintained its width as the shoreline migrated landward. On many occasions following these severe erosion events the dry portion of the beach aggraded and absorbed significant sand amounts removed from the foredunes. The remaining sand was transferred to the surf zone, where it changed the sand bar morphology and led to their coalescence and flattening.

JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												As the Arctic coast erodes, it drains thermokarst lakes, transforming them into lagoons, and, eventually, integrates them into subsea permafrost. Lagoons represent the first stage of a thermokarst lake transition to a marine setting and possibly more saline and colder upper boundary conditions. In this research, borehole data, electrical resistivity surveying, and modeling of heat and salt diffusion were carried out at Polar Fox Lagoon on the Bykovsky Peninsula, Siberia. Polar Fox Lagoon is a seasonally isolated water body connected to Tiksi Bay through a channel, leading to hypersaline waters under the ice cover. The boreholes in the center of the lagoon revealed floating ice and a saline cryotic bed underlain by a saline cryotic talik, a thin ice-bearing permafrost layer, and unfrozen ground. The bathymetry showed that most of the lagoon had bedfast ice in spring. In bedfast ice areas, the electrical resistivity profiles suggested that an unfrozen saline layer was underlain by a thick layer of refrozen talik. The modeling showed that thermokarst lake taliks can refreeze when submerged in saltwater with mean annual bottom water temperatures below or slightly above 0 degrees C. This occurs, because the top-down chemical degradation of newly formed ice-bearing permafrost is slower than the refreezing of the talik. Hence, lagoons may precondition taliks with a layer of ice-bearing permafrost before encroachment by the sea, and this frozen layer may act as a cap on gas migration out of the underlying talik.

Observations and Modeling of a Hydrothermal Plume in Yellowstone Lake	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Acoustic Doppler current profiler and conductivity-temperature-depth data acquired in Yellowstone Lake reveal the presence of a buoyant plume above the "Deep Hole" hydrothermal system, located southeast of Stevenson Island. Distributed venting in the similar to 200 x 200-m hydrothermal field creates a plume with vertical velocities of similar to 10 cm/s in the mid-water column. Salinity profiles indicate that during the period of strong summer stratification the plume rises to a neutral buoyancy horizon at similar to 45-m depth, corresponding to a similar to 70-m rise height, where it generates an anomaly of similar to 5% (-0.0014 psu) relative to background lake water. We simulate the plume with a numerical model and find that a heat flux of 28 MW reproduces the salinity and vertical velocity observations, corresponding to a mass flux of 1.4 x 10(3) kg/s. When observational uncertainties are considered, the heat flux could range between 20 to 50 MW.					; stranne, christian/L-4382-2013; Luttrell, Karen/D-6772-2015	Sohn, Robert/0000-0002-9050-8603; stranne, christian/0000-0003-1004-5213; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				JUN 28	2019	46	12					6435	6442		10.1029/2019GL082523	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019GL082523													WOS:000477616300032

In an insular lake population of stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from the Queen Charlotte Islands, Western Canada, phenotypes with high or low number of lateral bony plates exhibited increased plate asymmetry relative to modal phenotypes. Asymmetric lateral plate phenotypes had increased prevalence and to a lesser extent intensity of parasitism relative to symmetric individuals, suggesting that differences in genetic resistance to pathogens contributed to unequal parasitism. The effect occurred mainly in the larger adults and during the warmest season, which may be due to the high Metabolic costs incurred during the summer breeding season. Dietary differences between symmetric and asymmetric phenotypes were also detected and could contribute to unequal infection rates by mediating exposure to infected prey items. Our study, which is one of the first long-term field assessments of asymmetry and parasitism, yields results that are consistent with studies linking asymmetry to reduced fitness and indicate that lateral plate asymmetry can be an indicator of poor individual quality, despite its apparent directionality.

J	Ma, X; Li, YP; Li, ZH				Ma, Xiao; Li, Yanping; Li, Zhenhua			The projection of canadian wind energy potential in future scenarios using a convection-permitting regional climate model	ENERGY REPORTS												The distribution of wind resources in the future will be altered by climate change. The high-resolution regional climate model is a powerful tool for predicting wind power changes. We use a pair of 4km convection-permitting Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) simulations over southern Canada to study wind energy. The high-resolution model better represents orography and the underlying surface that strongly affect near-surface winds. The simulations include a historical simulation (CTRL) of 13 years (2001-2013) and a future projection for the end of the 21st century (RCP 8.5 scenario), using the Pseudo Global Warming (PGW) approach. The wind power density (WPD) and extractable wind power (EWP) obtained from the winds from the two simulations are analyzed and compared. In the future, the wind energy potential over most areas of Canada will decrease, while the changes over current wind farms, located in optimal locations, would be less significant in terms of EWP. In fact, there will be a slight increase of EWP distributed along the coastal area of Eastern Quebec and the Great Lakes regions in southern Ontario. The changes also show seasonal and diurnal variations: In winter when wind energy growth is more significant, a larger magnitude of changes occurs at noon (c) 2022 The Author(s).

Spatial gradients of surface pCO(2) and CH4 concentrations were modest in the main basin. In Kabuno Bay, pCO(2) and CH4 concentrations in surface waters were higher, owing to the stronger in fl uence of subaquatic springs from depth. Seasonal variations of pCO(2) and CH4 in the main basin of Lake Kivu were strongly driven by deepening of the epilimnion and the resulting entrainment of water characterized by higher pCO(2) and CH4 concentrations. Physical and chemical vertical patterns in Kabuno Bay were seasonally stable, owing to a stronger strati fi cation and smaller surface area inducing fetch limitation of wind driven turbulence. A global and regional cross-system comparison of pCO(2) and CH4 concentrations in surface waters of lakes highlights the peculiarity of Kabuno Bay in terms of pCO(2) values in surface waters. In terms of surface CH4 concentrations, both Kabuno Bay and the main basin of Lake Kivu are at the lower end of values in lakes globally, despite the huge amounts of CH4 and CO2 in the deeper layers of the lake.

In Central Asia, anthrax represents a major veterinary and public health concern. In the Republic of Kyrgyzstan, ongoing anthrax outbreaks have been reported in humans associated with handling infected livestock and contaminated animal by-products such as meat or hides. The current anthrax situation has prompted calls for improved insights into the epidemiology, ecology, and spatial distribution of the disease in Kyrgyzstan to better inform control and surveillance. Disease control for both humans and livestock relies on annual livestock vaccination ahead of outbreaks. Toward this, we used a historic database of livestock anthrax reported from 1932 to 2006 mapped at high resolution to develop an ecological niche model-based prediction of B. anthracis across Kyrgyzstan and identified spatial clusters of livestock anthrax using a cluster morphology statistic. We also defined the seasonality of outbreaks in livestock. Cattle were the most frequently reported across the time period, with the greatest number of cases in late summer months. Our niche models defined four areas as suitable to support pathogen persistence, the plateaus near Talas and Bishkek, the valleys of western Kyrgyzstan along the Fergana Valley, and the low-lying areas along the shore of Lake Isyk-Kul. These areas should be considered "at risk" for livestock anthrax and subsequent human cases. Areas defined by the niche models can be used to prioritize anthrax surveillance and inform efforts to target livestock vaccination campaigns.

J	Ghazanfari, SP; Karimi, M				Ghazanfari, Seyedeh Parvaneh; Karimi, Mitra			Cheshme Ali in Damghan and reasons for its sacredness	BAGH-E NAZAR												Due to the role of natural elements in human life, attention to these elements was common in many ancient cultures, including Iran. This consideration was so important that some cultures believed in the sacredness of these natural elements and held ceremonies for them. Water is one of these natural elements. Formation of cities and development of human civilization relies on it and wherever remained urban civilization from ancient times is encountered, footprint of spring and rivers can be found around them. This natural element is doubly important in the geographical area of Iran considering region's warm and dry climate. These factors alongside the longtime water shortage problem in Iran are the underlying reason for many Iranians beliefs being about protecting water and preventing its contamination. Thus, in many parts of Iran, especially in the central plateau, sacred waters can be found. These waters include sacred springs, lakes and canals. Also waters with their origins and existence linked to holy people such as Prophets and Imams are considered as sacred waters. Cheshme Ali in Damghan, as the origin of the only permanent river of the city, is an instance of these sacred places that dates back to the pre-Islamic era. This place is sacred for inhabitants and people consider the root of the 1000 year old nearby tree as holy and sacred. According to evidence and documents in historical books, excavations and observations of the author, the reason for the sacredness of this place is the sacred water originating from the mountain. Perhaps this place was a Mitra temple for worshiping Mitra and Nahid along with water: triad of water, tree, and mountain.																			1735-9635	2251-7197				DEC	2016	13	42					57	66																WOS:000417842000005

Environmental and Hunter-Gatherer Responses to the White River Ash East Volcanic Eruption in the Late Holocene Canadian Subarctic	ARCTIC												The eastern lobe of the Alaskan White River Ash volcanic event of AD 846 - 848 blanketed portions of Yukon and Northwest Territories, Canada, in 5 to 50 cm of tephra. The eruption has been linked to concurrent changes among hunter-gatherers, including the spread of new technologies and the continent-wide migration of a group of Dene ancestors from Subarctic Canada to the United States. We use published palaeoenvironmental data ( primarily pollen and charcoal profiles) as well as studies of modern ash fall ecology and human health hazards associated with eruptions to reconstruct effects of the White River Ash east event on northern hunter-gatherer subsistence. While many components of local ecosystems appear to have rebounded quickly from ash deposition, we deduce a more pronounced impact on the important game species of caribou and salmon, the seasonal migration paths of which were intersected by thick deposits of ash. A trophic model informed by palaeoenvironmental data and ethnohistoric records suggests that negative biological effects of the ash temporarily pushed hunter-gatherer populations to neighbouring and less affected kin groups for up to 100 years. This synthesis contextualises archaeological theories of human responses to ecological disturbance events in circumpolar landscapes.

Soil genesis and mineralogy across a volcanic lithosequence	GEODERMA												Lithology is a principle state factor of soil formation, interacting with climate, organisms, topography and time to define pedogenesis. A lithosequence of extrusive igneous lithologies (rhyolite obsidian, dacite, andesite and basalt) was identified in the Clear Lake Volcanic Field in the Coast Range of northern California to determine the effects of lithology on pedogenesis, clay mineralogy and soil physiochemical properties. Based on regional landscape erosion rates (0.2-0.5 mm yr(-1)), the soil residence times for the investigated pedons (similar to 150 cm deep) were of the order of 3000 to 7500 years indicating that the soils developed under the relatively stable Holocene mesic/xeric climate regime. Soils from all lithologies developed to a similar Xeralf taxonomy with remarkably consistent physiochemical properties. Although total (Fe-t) and dithionite-citrate extractable (Fe-d) iron concentrations diverged across lithologies, the degree of weathering as assessed by the Fe-d/Fe-t ratio was similar across the lithosequence. In spite of large differences in silica content of the parent materials, the clay mineralogical assemblage of all lithologies was dominated by kaolin minerals (kaolinite and/or halloysite). All pedons displayed an increase in halloysite and the degree of halloysite hydration with increasing depth, except the basalt pedon, which was dominated by kaolinite with only trace halloysite. We attribute this lack of halloysite in the basalt pedon to the lower silica activities associated with this silica-poor lithology. There was a lack of nanocrystalline minerals across all lithologies as inferred from selective dissolution. The dominance of crystalline materials is a function of the xeric soil moisture regime whereby summer soil profile desiccation promotes dehydration and crystallization of metastable nanocrystalline precursors. Further, the pronounced summer dry period results in dehydration of halloysite (1.0 nm) to halloysite (0.7 nm; also referred to as meta halloysite in some literature), together with transformation to kaolinite, in the upper soil profile. In spite of the relatively young soil residence times of these soils (Holocene age), the effects of lithology persisted only in differences in Fe oxide concentrations (Fed), as well as a lack of significant halloysite in basalt pedons. The overwhelming effect of climate in these highly weatherable parent materials narrowed the trajectory of pedogenesis, resulting in soils from contrasting lithologies converging on kaolin mineralogy, a lack of nanocrystalline constituents, and similar soil physiochemical properties.

J	Hanson, T; Stastna, M; Coutino, A				Hanson, Taylor; Stastna, Marek; Coutino, Aaron			Stratified shear instability in the cabbeling regime	PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS												The shear instability of stratified fluids is a well-studied problem in transition to turbulence. In temperate lakes, early springs typically lead to a weak thermal stratification involving water both above and below the temperature at which the density maximum occurs. This implies that mixing of two parcels with the same density, but different temperature, can lead to the creation of denser fluid, a phenomenon known as cabbeling. We report on simulations of shear instability in the cabbeling regime. We find that the initial stages of instability are dominated by shear instability, yielding billows. However, these billows are systematically located below the centerline of the shear layer. Three-dimensionalization occurs through Rayleigh-Taylor-like instabilities, and cabbeling efficiency is greatly increased in the fully three-dimensionalized state. By contrasting with initial states that have the same density profile, but a temperature well outside of the cabbeling regime, we demonstrate that the fully three-dimensional state of the density field is fundamentally different in the cabbeling regime.																			2469-990X					AUG 5	2021	6	8							084802	10.1103/PhysRevFluids.6.084802	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.6.084802													WOS:000681427900002

With a new composite of multi-spectral high resolution satellite observations, we show that the area of this Iranian lake has decreased by around 88% in the past decades, far more than previously reported (similar to 25% to 50%). The lake's shoreline has been receding severely with no sign of recovery, which has been partly blamed on prolonged droughts. We use the lake basin's satellite-based gauge-adjusted climate record of the Standardized Precipitation Index data to demonstrate that the on-going shoreline retreat is not solely an artifact of prolonged droughts alone. Drastic changes to lake health are primarily consequences of aggressive regional water resources development plans, intensive agricultural activities, anthropogenic changes to the system, and upstream competition over water. This commentary is a call for action to both develop sustainable restoration ideas and to put new visions and strategies into practice before Lake Urmia falls victim to the Aral Sea syndrome.

J	CAINE, N				CAINE, N			SNOWPACK INFLUENCES ON GEOMORPHIC PROCESSES IN GREEN LAKES VALLEY, COLORADO FRONT RANGE	GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL												In the alpine catchment of Green Lakes Valley, the great variability in snow distribution is an important influence on environmental conditions. The snow cover has relatively little direct effect on geomorphic processes: avalanches of wet snow in Spring transport small volumes of debris to the valley floor and boulders are shifted locally in small sub-nival pavements. Indirectly, the influence of snow patterns on erosion is much greater. By changing the surface topography, it facilitates sediment transport across the tundra; through its control of hydrologic responses, its meltwater mediates sediment and solute movement; and by controlling the biota, it defines the source areas from which most sediments and solutes are derived.																			0016-7398	1475-4959				MAR	1995	161		1				55	68		10.2307/3059928	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3059928													WOS:A1995QR59800006

We discovered LCAs in the brackish Lake Takahoko in northern Japan. The identity of LCA-producing species was investigated using 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and organic geochemical analysis. Two distinct genetic groups, termed Tak-A and Tak-B, were identified within the Group II haptophyte phylotype. Tak-A was closely related to Hap-A, which was obtained from Lake George, USA; and Tak-B was identified as Isochrysis galbana. Because Hap-A and Isochrysis galbana have similar temperature calibrations, Tak-A and Tak-B were also expected to share similar calibrations. Therefore, the changes of their relative abundances in the lake should not significantly disturb paleotemperature reconstructions. The alkenone temperature recorded in the surface sediment corresponded to the lake temperature in early to late summer. This is likely related to the haptophyte bloom season in Lake Takahoko suggesting that this lake may be a viable location for creating a lacustrine alkenone paleotemperature record.

J	Dembowska, EA; Napiorkowski, P				Dembowska, Ewa A.; Napiorkowski, Pawel			A case study of the planktonic communities in two hydrologically different oxbow lakes, Vistula River, Central Poland	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Floodplain lakes are important elements of landscapes with large rivers. In this study we compared planktonic communities of two oxbow lakes of the Vistula River. We investigated how the inflow of the river's water affected their physicochemical and biological conditions including water temperature, water transparency, oxygen concentration, and macrophyte coverage of the bottom. These parameters in turn affected plankton community. The average phytoplankton abundance in the isolated lake was over two times lower than in the lake connected to the river. Cryptophyta dominated in the phytoplankton community in the isolated lake and diatoms - in the lake supplied with water from the river. The average abundance of zooplankton in the isolated lake was more than twice as high as that in the lake which was connected to the river. The first lake proved to be more attractive for zooplankton due to its stable living conditions (similar to the conditions observed in ponds), higher temperature in summer, and nutrient availability due to the high abundance of small phytoplankton. The results of our research indicate that species composition, plankton abundance, and Chl-a concentration depended on whether there was water exchange between the particular lake and the Vistula River. Hydrological conditions shaped the relationships between the components of the biota.

We used near shore hourly measurements (n = 2122) of turbidity (contaminant proxy) and water velocity (sediment resuspension proxy) to track high-frequency contaminant dynamics during a 0.6 m change in water level observed in autumn 2017 in a large French lake. Simultaneously, discrete trace metal measurements highlighted that trapped sediment was more contaminated and finer than surficial sediment supporting that suspended particles (measured by turbidity) were a preferential medium for contaminant mobility. General additive models involving tensor products revealed the enhancement of wind-speed and river discharge effects on turbidity with water draw down. The decrease of the explained deviances by the models over time-lags indicated short time-scale response of turbidity to external forcing. Three of the four major turbid events occurred at the lowest water-level and were concomitant of sediment resuspension as well as precipitation events and/or river flood suggesting a complex interplay among in-lake and watershed processes at controlling sediment mobility during the WLF. These results shed in light that WLF can affect lake littoral hydrodynamic cascading up to the enhancement of contaminant mobility. Sediment resuspension may be an overlooked feature of WLF increasing contamination risk and exposure for littoral organisms with widespread ecological consequences due to the large number of water-level regulated ecosystems.

The model can be driven with observed daily or hourly atmospheric forcing of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, cloud amount and snowfall. In addition to computing the energy balance components, key model output includes the temperature profile at an arbitrary number of levels within the ice/snow (or the water temperature if there is no ice) and ice thickness (clear ice and snow-ice) on a daily basis, as well as freeze-up and break-up dates. The lake-ice model is used to simulate ice-growth processes on shallow lakes in arctic, sub-arctic, and high-boreal forest environments. Model output is compared with field and remote sensing observations gathered over several ice seasons. Simulated ice thickness, including snow-ice formation, compares favourably with field measurements. Ice-on and ice-off dates are also well simulated when compared with field and satellite observations, with a mean absolute difference of 2 days. Model simulations and observations illustrate the key role that snow cover plays on the seasonal evolution of ice thickness and the timing of spring break-up. It is also shown that lake morphometry, depth in particular, is a determinant of ice-off dates for shallow lakes at high latitudes.

J	Schiefer, E; Gilbert, R				Schiefer, Erik; Gilbert, Robert			Proglacial sediment trapping in recently formed Silt Lake, upper Lillooet Valley, Coast Mountains, British Columbia	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												The sedimentology of proglacial Silt Lake was assessed by lake sediment coring and monitoring of lacustrine processes during a late-summer period of high glacier melt to characterize sediment delivery from the heavily glacierized catchment and investigate the sediment trapping dynamics of this upland lake. A complete varve chronology was established for a distal basin of the lake which,vas exposed by Lillooet Glacier retreat between 1947 and 1962. The varve record showed decreasing sedimentation rates in the basin while the glacier retreated, and as the lake became free of ice contact in the early 1970s. Although recession has continued over recent decades, and glacier proximity to the lake has, therefore, continued decreasing, lacustrine sedimentation rates are now accelerating due to changing basin morphometry caused by delta progradation. Over shorter time scales, lake sedimentation patterns respond to changing runoff conditions, including late-summer glacier melt intensity, intra-annual flooding events, diumal runoff fluctuations, and within-lake turbidity currents. Turbidity currents included quasi-regular flows during high diurnal discharges and an episodic flushing of temporarily stored sediment from the sandur or delta at a time of low stage. Suspended sediment yield to Silt Lake is estimated to exceed 10(-3) Mg km(-2) a(-1), a magnitude that surpasses previous local and regional yield estimates for the glacierized headwaters of the Lillooet River valley. Since Silt Lake currently traps a significant prooportion of that upland sediment supply, and the trapping efficiency of the basin has been variable at decadal time scales, the formation and continued development of Lilt Lake has likely had a significant influence on downstream sediment delivery. Lacustrine sediment-based proxies of long-term hydroclimatic variability being developed in glacially distal settings should include provisions for dynamic sediment trapping effects in upstream water bodies that often form in the active proglacial environment.

Melchior			Automated mapping of the seasonal evolution of surface meltwater and its links to climate on the Amery Ice Shelf, Antarctica	CRYOSPHERE												Surface meltwater is widespread around the Antarctic Ice Sheet margin and has the potential to influence ice shelf stability, ice flow and ice-albedo feedbacks. Our understanding of the seasonal and multi-year evolution of Antarctic surface meltwater is limited. Attempts to generate robust meltwater cover time series have largely been constrained by computational expense or limited ice surface visibility associated with mapping from optical satellite imagery. Here, we add a novel method for calculating visibility metrics to an existing meltwater detection method within Google Earth Engine. This enables us to quantify uncertainty induced by cloud cover and variable image data coverage, allowing time series of surface meltwater area to be automatically generated over large spatial and temporal scales. We demonstrate our method on the Amery Ice Shelf region of East Antarctica, analysing 4164 Landsat 7 and 8 optical images between 2005 and 2020. Results show high interannual variability in surface meltwater cover, with mapped cumulative lake area totals ranging from 384 to 3898 km(2) per melt season. By incorporating image visibility assessments, however, we estimate that cumulative total lake areas are on average 42 % higher than minimum mapped values. We show that modelled melt predictions from a regional climate model provide a good indication of lake cover in the Amery region and that annual lake coverage is typically highest in years with a negative austral summer SAM index. Our results demonstrate that our method could be scaled up to generate a multi-year time series record of surface water extent from optical imagery at a continent-wide scale.					; van Wessem, Melchior/AAB-1987-2019; Lea, James/HNI-3615-2023; Lea, James/N-5699-2015	Tuckett, Peter/0000-0001-9953-2602; Ely, Jeremy/0000-0003-4007-1500; Lea, James/0000-0003-1885-0858; Livingstone, Stephen/0000-0002-7240-5037; Sole, Andrew/0000-0001-5290-8967													1994-0416	1994-0424				DEC 22	2021	15	12					5785	5804		10.5194/tc-15-5785-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-5785-2021													WOS:000733129700001

Shams			Three strategies for combating the corrosion of steel pipes carrying desalinated potable water	DESALINATION												The corrosion of metal pipes carrying potable water is a universal problem. The rate of metal attack depends oil a number of factors, the most important of which is the nature of water. Desalinated water is known to be very aggressive. Its aggressivity exceeds that measured in naturally occurring river-, spring- or lake waters. For these reasons, other means must be thought of to improve the performance of pipelines carrying desalinated water. The present paper directs attention to three practical strategies that could be used for this purpose. All work on the waterside of the piping system. The theoretical background of the three strategies is described in short and is referred to in terms of indices: the Hardness Index, Oxygen Index and Corrosion Index. The advantages and drawbacks of each strategy are mentioned.

Simon; Meyer, Jonathan			Interdecadal Climate Variations Controlling the Water Level of Lake Qinghai over the Tibetan Plateau	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												Using observed and reanalysis data, the pronounced interdecadal variations of Lake Qinghai (LQH) water levels and associated climate factors were diagnosed. From the 1960s to the early 2000s, the water level of LQH in the Tibetan Plateau has experienced a continual decline of 3 m but has since increased considerably. A water budget analysis of the LQH watershed suggested that the water vapor flux divergence del. Q is the dominant atmospheric process modulating precipitation and subsequently the lake volume change Delta V. The marked interdecadal variability in Delta V and del. Q was found to be related to the North Pacific (NP) and Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) modes during the cold season (November-March). Through empirical orthogonal function (EOF) and regression analyses, the water vapor sink over the LQH watershed also responds significantly to the summer Eurasian wave train modulated by the low-frequency variability associated with the cold season NP and PDO modes. Removal of these variability modes (NP, PDO, and the Eurasian wave train) led to a residual uptrend in the hydrological variables of Delta V, del. Q, and precipitation, corresponding to the net water level increase. Attribution analysis using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) single-forcing experiments shows that the simulations driven by greenhouse gas forcing produced a significant increase in the LQH precipitation, while anthropogenic aerosols generated a minor wetting trend as well.																			1525-755X	1525-7541				NOV	2017	18	11					3013	3025		10.1175/JHM-D-17-0071.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-17-0071.1													WOS:000417353900009

Picocyanobacteria, small eukaryotic autotrophs, heterotrophic prokaryotes, and viruses were studied in the 0-50 m surface layers to highlight the impact of both physical and chemical parameters as well as possible biotic interactions on the functioning of microbial communities. Some specificities were recorded according to the trophic status of each ecosystem such as the higher number of viruses and heterotrophic bacteria in mesotrophic environments (i.e., Lakes Geneva and Bourget) or the higher abundance of picocyanobacteria in the oligotrophic Lake Annecy. However, both seasonal (temperature) and spatial (depth) variations were comparatively more important than the trophic status in driving the microbial communities' abundances in these three lakes, as revealed by principal component analysis (PCA). A strong viral termination of the heterotrophic bacterial blooms could be observed in autumn for each lake, in parallel to the mixing of the upper lit layers. As virus to bacteria ratio (VBR) was indeed very high at this period with values varying between 87 and 114, such important relationships between viruses and bacteria were likely. The magnitudes of seasonal variations in VBR, with the highest values ever reported so far, were largely greater than the magnitude of theoretical variations due to the trophic status, suggesting also a strong seasonality in virioplankton production associated to prokaryotic dynamics. FCM analyses allowed discriminating several viral groups. VirusLike Particles group 1 (VLP1) and group 2 (VLP2) were always observed and significantly correlated to bacteria for the former and chlorophyll a and picocyanobacteria for the latter, suggesting that most of VLP1 and VLP2 could be bacteriophages and cyanophages, respectively. On the basis of these results, new ways of investigation emerge concerning the study of relationships between specific picoplanktonic groups; and overall these results provide new evidence of the necessity to consider further viruses for a better understanding of lake plankton ecology.

A winter case study in the Mazurian Lakeland, Poland	ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI					10th Teriological Conference	FEB 13-14, 2007	Warsaw, POLAND					The distribution of otter and American mink tracks in the Mazurian Lakeland during winter, characterised by low temperatures and thick ice cover, was used to analyse competition between the two species for access to the limited area of foraging sites. The study was carried out in February and March, 2006 and comprised 12 lakes and sections of three rivers and two canals. Tracking was conducted along a total of 98.25 km of the shoreline, which was divided into 393 study sections, 250-m-long each. Otter tracks were recorded at all the lakes and canals under study and at two rivers. Mink tracks were recorded along all the watercourses and on eleven lakes. The otter was recorded in 25.9% of the sections, whereas American mink in 28.8% of the sections. Co-occurrence of the otter and mink was observed in 8.8% of the sections. In sections with unfrozen stretches (12.3% of all the study sections), the frequency of otter and mink tracks was significantly higher than in totally frozen sections. Co-occurrence of the otter and mink was found in 28.3% of the sections with access to open water. In unfrozen sections the frequency of co-occurrence of the two species was four times higher than in totally frozen sections. Only 20% of the sections with air holes were not visited by any of the two species. The study showed that during periods of low temperatures, when accessibility to open water and aquatic prey was limited, both species clearly preferred those parts of the water bodies where unfrozen places remained. A high rate of co-occurrence of the two species in such places indicates mutual tolerance between the otter and mink in the sections offering aquatic food resources.					; Romanowski, Jerzy/AAE-8095-2021	Romanowski, Jerzy/0000-0003-1050-6403; Brzezinski, Marcin/0000-0002-6300-0425; 													0003-455X					AUG	2008	45	4					317	322		10.5735/086.045.0412	http://dx.doi.org/10.5735/086.045.0412													WOS:000259566100013

In Turkic-type post-collisional magmatism, the magmatic products are dominantly alkalic to peralkalic and greatly resemble those of extensional regions giving rise to much confusion especially in interpreting old collisional orogenic belts. Such magmatic regions are also host to a variety of economically valuable ore deposits, including gold. One place in the world where today active, Turkic-type post-collisional magmatism is present is the eastern Anatolian high plateau, produced after the terminal Arabia/Eurasia collision in the late Miocene. The plateau is mostly underlain by the late Cretaceous to Oligocene East Anatolian Accretionary Complex, which formed south of the Rhodope-Pontide magmatic arc. This subduction-accretion complex has been further shortening since the collision, but it has also since been domed and became almost entirely covered by at least 15,000 km(3) of volcanic rocks. The volcanic rocks are calc-alkalic in the north, transitional in the middle, and alkalic in the south of the plateau. Where the crust is thinnest today (less than 38 km), the volcanics are derived almost entirely from an enriched mantle. The ages of the volcanics also become younger from north to south, from about 11 Ma to possibly 17th century AD. We interpret the origin of the magmatic rocks as the result of decompression melting of the asthenospheric mantle sucked towards the exposed base of the East Anatolian Accretionary Complex as the oceanic lithosphere beneath it fell out. The lower density of the hot asthospheric material was the cause of the doming. We believe that similar processes dominated the post-collisional tectonics of such vast Turkic-type orogens as the Altaids of Central Asia, the late Devonian-early Carboniferous Lachlan Belt in southeastern Australia, and the Pan-African collage of northeast Afro-Arabia. It is likely that Archaean collisions were dominated by Turkic-type post-collisional events rather than Tibetan ones that only became common in the Proterozoic. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	Hatch, LK; Reuter, JE; Goldman, CR				Hatch, LK; Reuter, JE; Goldman, CR			Daily phosphorus variation in a mountain stream	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Monthly diel monitoring studies for phosphorus content were conducted (1995-1996 period) for multiple stations on Incline Creek, a mountain stream in the Lake Tahoe basin (California-Nevada). Large discharge and particulate P (PP) concentration fluctuations occurred during June in the early evening as snowmelt from higher elevations arrived at the lower stream reaches. June diel dissolved organic P (DOP) concentrations steadily increased, while soluble reactive P (SRP) concentrations remained constant. June diel PP concentrations associated with sand-sized particles (PPsand: >63 mu m) exhibited a clockwise hysteresis, indicating possible sediment source depletion on a daily timescale. June diel PP associated with silt- and clay-sized particles (PPsc: >0.45 mu m and <63 mu m) exhibited counterclockwise hysteresis behavior, suggesting a potential groundwater contribution to PPsc. PPsc comprised the majority of PP concentration, except during high-discharge events when PPsand, concentration was dominant. Areal PP loading, specifically PPsand, appears to originate primarily from the lower eastern branch of Incline Creek during the spring snowmelt season. Possible sources include a ski resort/parking lot and a golf course. DOP and SRP areal loads were greatest from the undeveloped upper subwatershed, suggesting that natural factors such as slope are influencing loading of small-sized P fractions.																			0043-1397	1944-7973				DEC	1999	35	12					3783	3791		10.1029/1999WR900256	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/1999WR900256													WOS:000084173200017

Ellen			Beyond the mean: Variation in incubation temperature influences timing of hatch for lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush)	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) is an ecologically and economically important fall-spawning species that inhabits northern lakes at a wide range of latitudes and with widely varying temperature dynamics. However, fall spawning also means that adult behavior is largely divorced from the conditions at hatching. Embryonic development must therefore be responsive to external stimuli in a way that consistently results in hatch occurring during a viable period despite considerable variability in phenology. Despite extensive work on lake trout development and culture, hatch timing remains difficult to predict precisely by either days-to-hatch or thermal units (TU)-to-hatch without experience with a particular system and strain. We hypothesized that this problem may be due in part to a non-linear response to temperature variability during development, coupled with the potential for poorly controlled variability in past studies due to differences in hysteresis and thermal inertia among experimental setups. To test this hypothesis, we reared individually identified embryos from controlled parental crosses in temperature-controlled incubators set to maintain a range of constant or variable temperatures and measured both the timing and size of all individuals at hatch. Our results show that temperature variation has a pronounced effect on the timing of hatching, with embryos reared in a system with a 3 degrees C daily swing hatching an average of six days earlier than those raised in a constant environment with the same mean temperature. These findings raise questions about the utility of TU as a predictor of hatch timing, especially in natural systems that are often inherently variable.

A study in 1983-1984 documenting nesting activity in the same area provided a baseline for comparisons of possible effects of the spill on nesting activity. Density of adult loons in 1989 was similar to densities in 1983-1984. We located 26 pairs of Yellow-billed Loons in 29 nesting territories.

Limnological records, from several stations along the lake axis, indicated homoiothermal conditions until Sept., the hot dry season. From then until records ceased in Dec., thermoclines and oxyclines were present in the deeper eastern basins. H2S was recorded in hypolimnial waters towards the end of the year. Open water of the shallow, wind- and wave-swept eastern basins remained oxygenated throughout the year. Water transparency increased 5-fold from April-Dec., also increasing from east to west. pH was alkaline becoming more acid in cool winter months and in bottom waters of stratified basins. Conductivity ranged from 95-119 .mu.S cm-1 with higher values in shallow lake margins. Chemical content of surface waters showed little seasonal or spatial variation and was, in general, comparable with pre-impoundment levels. Duration of the initial productive phase will probably be shorter than Kariba due to more rapid lake water exchange but indications are that productivity will be higher in the maturation phase.

Freshwater invertebrates of sub-Antarctic Marion Island	AFRICAN ZOOLOGY												The freshwater habitats (mires, streams, lakes, pools and wallows) on sub-Antarctic Marion Island were examined for invertebrates. Sixty-eight species were found, including 45 new records for the Island. Of these 56 were bona fide aquatic invertebrates, the rest being terrestrial or brackish interlopers that had fallen or been blown into the water. The aquatic species include five platyhelminthes, a gastrotrich, three tardigrades, 28 rotifers, six nematodes, two annelids and 11 arthropods. Most are familiar species that have been recorded on other sub-Antarctic islands. The invertebrate faunas of the various freshwater habitats were basically similar in species composition, with the abundances of particular species dependent upon the water body's size, distance from the sea and degree of eutrophication resulting from seal and seabird manuring.																			1562-7020	2224-073X				OCT	2012	47	2					203	215		10.3377/004.047.0207	http://dx.doi.org/10.3377/004.047.0207													WOS:000208843600002

The bacterial population, which consists mainly of free bacteria (94% of the total bacterial abundance), displays only low cell densities (0.6 to 7 x 10(5) cells . ml-1) and represents low biomass values (0.9 to 11.5 mugC.1-1). The bacteria represent from 0.9 to 23.8% (M = 9.7%) of the ''microplanktonic biomass'' (with the exclusion of heterotrophic nanoflagellates, i.e. bacteria + phytoplankton + ciliates, size range 0.2-160 mum). The abundance of the phytoplankton varies between 0.5 and 1.8 x 10(6) cells . l-1, and the biomass values between 12 and 118 mugC.l-1. The phytoplankton population constitutes the largest part of the microplanktonic biomass (51.9 to 96.6%, M = 80.6%), and the diatom Melosira italica subsp. subarctica is the largely dominant species of this community. The population of ciliates, essentially Oligotrichida and Scuticociliatida, displays densities between 1. 3 and 38.3 x 10(3) cells . l-1 (M = 6.7 x 10(3) cells . l-1), and biomass values vary from 0. 1 0 to 16.30 mugC.l-1 (M = 6.01 mugC.l-1). The ciliates constitute thus from 0.1 to 26.4% (M = 9.8%) of the microplanktonic biomass. Whereas the oligotrichs are best represented in the euphotic zone, the small-sized scuticociliates dominate in the hypolimnion. Besides, species having symbionts and considered to be mixotrophic (Strobilidium gyrans, Strombidium viride, Stokesia vernalis) develop preferentially in the epilimnion and constitute more than 50% of the total ciliate biomass.					; Sime-Ngando, Télesphore/M-4134-2019	Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/0000-0002-7240-5803; 													1015-1621						1993	55	1					1	9		10.1007/BF00877254	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00877254													WOS:A1993KZ67000001

The intensity index and zonal position index of the wintertime northern branch ridge (WNBR) are defined in this study by using the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis data and precipitation and temperature observations at 160 stations in China. Interannual variation features of the WNBR and its relation with precipitation and surface air temperature in China are discussed based on wavelet analysis, correlation analysis, and composite analysis. The results indicate that the intensity and zonal position of the WNBR exhibit significant interannual variability. The intensity of the WNBR gradually weakens and varies in periodic cycles of 4-6, quasi-2, and quasi-16 yr. Its zonal position shifts westward slightly and varies in periodic cycles of quasi-8 and quasi-16 yr. The WNBR is highly correlated with precipitation and surface air temperature in China. When the WNBR is strong (weak) and its zonal position shifts eastward (westward), winter precipitation in Northeast China and the northern region of Northwest China increases (decreases), whereas precipitation decreases in central China, South China, and eastern regions of Northwest and Southwest China. Meanwhile, surface air temperatures in most areas of China are higher (lower) than normal. Further investigation has revealed that the two indexes are closely related to variations in general atmospheric circulation, which explains why there exists a close linkage between the variation of the WNBR and climate in China. It is believed that the WNBR is also tied to the Rossby wave, the North Atlantic Oscillation, the East Asian trough, and the North Pacific jet stream.

J	Stevens, C				Stevens, Craig			Short-term dispersion and turbulence in a complex-shaped estuarine embayment	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Initial dispersion of material in complex-shaped embayments is examined using observations and scaling based in Crail Bay, Pelorus Sound, New Zealand in autumn of 2005. These observations show the highly variable nature of dispersive transport in an embayment with multiple headlands. Acoustic current profiler-derived typical flow speeds were around 0.05 ms(-1) which resulted in drifter-derived short-term ( < 6 h) horizontal eddy diffusivities of the order of 1 m(2)s(-1) which is somewhat larger than the empirical paradigm. Microstructure estimates of the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate were in the range 10(-9)-10(-7) m(2) s(-3), with some evidence that sidewalls influence the variability and that headlands increase the dissipation rate by at least and order of magnitude. A new parameter relating horizontal diffusivity to circulation and the tide is proposed. This and other scaling comparisons indicate that the headlands in Crail Bay create similar effects to those studied in other systems. However, the long decay times estimated for eddies here implies that they likely interact with other headlands, unlike some previously studied examples. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Pollen assemblages imply a vegetation development around the Maloja Pass from shrub tundra at the beginning of the Allerod to coniferous forest during the early Holocene with a lowering of the timberline during the Younger Dryas. Chironomid assemblages are characterized by several abrupt shifts in dominant taxa through the Lateglacial. The occurrence of taxa able to survive hypoxia in the second part of the Allerod and during the Preboreal, and their disappearance at the onset of the Younger Dryas cold phase suggest summer thermal stratification and unfavourable hypolimnetic oxygen conditions in the palaeo-lake during the warmer periods of the Lateglacial interstadial and early Holocene. Mean July air temperatures were reconstructed using a chironomid-temperature transfer function from the Alpine region. The pattern of reconstructed temperature changes agrees well with the Greenland delta O-18 record and other Lateglacial temperature inferences from Central Europe. The inferred July temperatures of ca 10.0 degrees C during most of the Allerod were slightly lower than modern values (10.8 degrees C) and increased up to ca 11.7 degrees C (i.e., above present-day values) at the end of the Allerod. The first part of the Younger Dryas was colder (ca 8.8 degrees C) than the second part (ca 9.8 degrees C). During most of the Preboreal, the temperatures persisted within the limits of 13.5-14.5 degrees C (i.e., ca 3 degrees C above present-day values). The amplitudes of temperature changes at the Allerod-Younger Dryas-Preboreal transitions were ca 3.5-4.0 degrees C. The temperature reconstruction also shows three short-lived cooling events of ca 1.5-2.0 degrees C, which may be attributed to the centennial-scale Greenland Interstadial events GI-1d and GI-1b, and the Preboreal Oscillation.

These show that both cyclones and strong wind events often are associated with atmospheric patterns resembling the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation, or the negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation. Custom teleconnection indices were derived from these maps of 700 hPa height differences, and the seasonal means of each of these indices were linearly regressed against the number of cyclones and the number of strong wind events in that season for each year. This procedure led to moderate, but statistically significant, correlation coefficients. This gives some basis for probabilistic prediction of cyclone passages and strong wind events at Lake Erie. Actual application in prediction will require skill also in predicting the geopotential heights, and predictions generalized over larger areas may have greater significance and robustness.

J	Shankman, D; Davis, L; de Leeuw, J				Shankman, David; Davis, Lisa; de Leeuw, Jan			River management, landuse change, and future flood risk in China's Poyang Lake region	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT												Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China covering 3800 km(2) during the summer wet season. It drains into the Changjiang (Yangtze River) at its northern end through a narrow outlet. During the last half of the twentieth century (1949-1999) average annual maximum stage and number of severe flood events in China's Poyang Lake region increased significantly. There are two primary causes for this trend. One was increasing Changjiang stage, which is the most important determinant of Poyang Lake stage. The second cause for increasing lake stage was levee construction at the margins of Poyang Lake that greatly limited lake size, and therefore, reduced floodwater storage. More recent changes affecting future flood risk include completion of the Three-Gorges Dam, which was intended for flood-control. The Three-Gorges Dam can be used to hold back floodwater for common annual floods, but the reservoir's storage capacity is too small to reduce downstream discharge during the most severe floods. Also, flood control policies were modified during the past decade, and now focus on permanent removal of some levees and the opening of others during severe floods to increase floodwater storage. These policies have not been fully implemented, and the threat of severe floods affecting densely populated areas in the Poyang Lake region has not been eliminated.						Davis, M. A.

When fry were abundant (in 1979 and 1981, but not in 1980 or 1982) the summer zooplankton became sparse and was dominated by copepods and rotifers. In years of good recruitment, as each of the preferred cladoceran prey species entered the diet of underyearling roach, its density dropped dramatically. Mean size of Daphnia hyalina and Ceriodaphnia quadrangula also declined significantly during these seasons. The results of enclosure experiments indicate that the link between roach recruitment and zooplankton dynamics is causal. Older roach also feed to a significant extent on zooplankton, but the 0+ age group exerted the greatest influence. The abundant underyearling roach in years of good recruitment showed poor growth, as a result of depression of their prey populations.

All the three models with default settings exhibited distinct errors in the simulated vertical temperature profile. Then model calibration was conducted by adjusting three (four) key parameters within FLake and CoLM-Lake (WRF-Lake) in a series of sensitive experiments. Results showed that each model's performance is sensitive to the key parameters and becomes much better when adjusting all the key parameters relative to tuning single parameter. Overall, setting the temperature of maximum water density to 1.1 degrees C instead of 4 degrees C in the three models consistently leads to improved vertical thermal structure simulation during cold seasons; reducing the light extinction coefficient in FLake results in much deeper mixed layer and warmer thermocline during warm seasons in better agreement with the observation. The vertical thermal structure can be clearly improved by decreasing the light extinction coefficient and increasing the turbulent mixing in WRF-Lake and CoLM-Lake during warm seasons. Meanwhile, the modeled water temperature profile in warm seasons can be significantly improved by further replacing the constant surface roughness lengths by a parameterized scheme in WRF-Lake. Further intercomparison indicates that among the three calibrated models, FLake (WRF-Lake) performs the best to simulate the temporal evolution and intensity of temperature in the layers shallower (deeper) than 10m, while WRF-Lake is the best at simulating the amplitude and pattern of the temperature variability at all depths.

Invertebrate herbivory on submerged freshwater macrophytes, measured as per cent leaf area lost, was determined for sixteen species and forty-two populations of macrophytes during peak summer biomass in Danish streams and lakes. 2. All seventeen Potamogeton populations and seventeen of the remaining twenty-five non-Potamogeton populations were grazed. Species of Potamogeton were significantly more heavily grazed (mean 4.2%) than non-Potamogeton species (mean 0.8%). Herbivory losses were not significantly different between stream (mean 2.4%) and lake populations (mean 1.9%). Wide ranges in herbivory loss were observed between species from the same locality and within species from different localities. The location of main damage to either old or young leaves was not species specific but varied among localities. Additional data for four macrophyte populations showed that herbivory loss had a strong seasonal variation (e.g. 1.0-26.3% for Potamogeton perfoliatus), with maximum losses during May-June. 3. Although the mean defoliation percentages were low during the period of maximum macrophyte biomass, they were not systematically lower than encountered for terrestrial plants.

Wular Lake, one of the largest freshwater lakes in Asia with a 13,000 ha area and a notable Ramsar wetland of international importance, supports thriving but increasingly threatened endemic fisheries that supply almost one-fourth of Jammu and Kashmir's fish catch and supports livelihoods of 3147 families of indigenous communities in a remote Himalayan region of India. A modified multi-dimensional RAPFISH methodology was used to ascertain the sustainability of the lake's fisheries. Catch records and published literature formed secondary data sources while primary information was collected through detailed key informant interviews, focus group discussions and participant observation methods, among both resource users and resource managers during 2018-2019. With a RAPFISH score of 40%, Wular lake fisheries fell in a less sustainable category, which is a cause of concern. Along with the technology evaluation field, which fared worst with a poor score of 15.77%, social (30.39%) and governance (39.09%) fields were less sustainable, while economic (69.33%) and ecology fields (57.68%) fell in the quite sustainable category. Very poor education level, high population density, minimal infrastructure, primitive craft, increasing pollution and ineffective governance are prime drivers of low sustainability. Variability in scores of evaluation fields and indicators supports the validity and utility of the modified RAPFISH tool for illuminating multi-dimensionality and complexity of lake fishery management. In the context of sustaining a small-scale artisanal fishery and associated livelihoods, our findings suggest specific evidence-based interventions to improve the sustainability of lake fisheries that can avoid tragedy of commons problem.					; Gul, samrin/AAU-4507-2021	, Regu Atufa/0000-0002-1748-8300; PS, Ananthan/0000-0001-6113-4158; 													0969-997X	1365-2400				JUN	2023	30	3					284	299		10.1111/fme.12619	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fme.12619		MAR 2023											WOS:000950979500001

The present study analyses the last four decades of ice data from the subalpine lake, vre Heimdalsvatn, and water temperature data from its outlet river, Hinogla. These data are compared to water temperature data from three neighbouring, quite different locations, the glacier-fed rivers LeirungsAyeni and Sjoa, and the alpine lake, Bessvatn. The study also examines the air temperature/river temperature relationships, and the air temperature/ice freeze-up and break-up dates. During the months of July, August and September, the water temperature in Hinogla was well correlated to the air temperature, but the correlation was poor in the remaining months due to the ice cover and snow conditions. A significant temperature increase of 2-3A degrees C has been observed in Hinogla in the months August-October since 1984. There were only minor changes in the duration of the ice cover season during the last 40 years, but a delay of 9 days was found in the freeze-up date and a delay of 6 days in the break-up date, although the latter was not significant.																			0018-8158					MAR	2010	642	1					47	60		10.1007/s10750-010-0158-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0158-2													WOS:000275782400005
J	Hillbricht-Ilkowska, A; Kostrzewska-Szlakowska, I				Hillbricht-Ilkowska, A; Kostrzewska-Szlakowska, I			Surface microlayer in lakes of different trophic status: Nutrients concentration and accumulation	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												In humic, mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes (Masurian Lakeland, Poland) 100-200 samples of water were taken with the Larsson' plate from 0.5 mm surface microlayer (SM) and compared with the subsurface water (SSW). The concentrations of dissolved (in filtered water) and total (unfiltered) Kjeldahl nitrogen (organic and ammonium) (DKN, TKN) and phosphorus (DP TP) were measured and the concentration of their particulate (sestonic) forms (PON, PP) estimated. The enrichment (accumulation) factor (Ef) values were calculated as the ratio of nutrients concentration in SM versus SSW Accumulation of nutrients in SM was a common phenomena in the studied lakes. However, it occurred more frequently (close to 100% of samples) for TKN than for TP (60-70%) as well as generally more frequently in humic lake than in other lakes. Mean values of Ef for TKN were 2.6, 2.2 and 1.6 respectively for the humic, meso- and eutrophic lakes but the accumulation values for TP were lower 2.3, 2.1 and 1.5 respectively for above lakes (the differences between concentrations in both layers as well as between lakes are significant). It means that in average the concentration of N and P in SM is at least two times greater than in SSW in humic and mesotrophic lakes. Accumulation of particulate forms of nutrients (PP, PKN) in SM is less frequent but the respective values of Ef are higher comparing with the total content of these nutrients and again higher for nitrogen than phosphorus. The higher values of the weight ration NIT (33-76) in seston were found in SM in comparison with SSW (24-56) as well as higher contribution of particulate (sestonic) N (PON) to its total content in respective layer. Generally higher values of these two indices were found in both layers of humic lake than in other lakes. No significant differences were found for the Ef values calculated for spring and summer periods (expected to direr in organic matter production and algae biomass) as well as for different sites (open water. shore region) in the lakes. It was concluded that the humic substances of allochthonous origin (mostly refractory and of high molecular weight) possibly predominate in the surface microlayer of the humic lake and support the stability and specificity of this layer in comparison with deeper water layer as well as in comparison with the meso- and eutrophic lakes. In highly productive, eutrophic lake. the surface microlaver is less distinct and stable possibly because of relatively greater role of in situ autochthonous production of labile organic matter which show's low affinity to the air-water interface. The surface microlayer in mesotrophic lake displays somehow intermediate properties in comparison with humic and eutrophic lakes.																			1505-2249						2004	52	4					461	478																WOS:000225739200008

The existing multi-proxy data set highlights the complex interplay of physical and ecological changes in response to climatic shifts and lake status changes. Yet, it remains unclear how microorganisms, such as Archaea, which do not leave microscopic features in the sedimentary record, were affected by these climatic shifts. Here we present the metagenomic data set of Hasseldala Port with a special focus on the abundance and biodiversity of Archaea. This allows reconstructing for the first time the temporal succession of major Archaea groups between 13.9 and 10.8 ka BP by using ancient environmental DNA metagenomics and fossil archaeal cell membrane lipids. We then evaluate to which extent these findings reflect physical changes of the lake system, due to changes in lake-water summer temperature and seasonal lake-ice cover. We show that variations in archaeal composition and diversity were related to a variety of factors (e.g., changes in lake water temperature, duration of lake ice cover, rapid sediment infilling), which influenced bottom water conditions and the sediment-water interface. Methanogenic Archaea dominated during the Allerod and Younger Dryas pollen zones, when the ancient lake was likely stratified and anoxic for large parts of the year. The increase in archaeal diversity at the Younger Dryas/Holocene transition is explained by sediment infilling and formation of a mire/peatbog. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A case study of the Sun Moon Lake National Scenic Area, Taiwan	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT												Tourism is evidently one of critical contributors to air pollution, while, air pollution seems to drive tourists away. This paper aims to explore whether air pollution, especially the carbon dioxide emission, would affect the business cycle of the demand for tourism at a popular scenic spot in Taiwan, i.e., the Sun Moon Lake. Macroeconomic variables and additional weather patterns are also considered as potential determinants of the demand for tourism in our Markov regime-switching model. The empirical results serve as evidence that the effects of air pollution and rainfall on the demand for tourism depend significantly on the phases of business cycle, and show that, during the peaks, monthly numbers of tourists traveling at the Sun Moon Lake would fall by 25,725 people as the number of bad air-quality day increases by one. The finding can provide policymakers an insight into the evaluation of the trade-off between industrial development and environmental protection. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

There were marked changes in the abundance of bacteria, HNF and ciliates and in protistan bacterivory during this period. The cell volume of free-living bacteria (0.121 +/- 0.031 mu m(3), mean +/- SD) was large relative to that reported in the literature. The cell volumes of HNF was 71.1 +/- 24.8 mu m(3). Both cell volumes did not follow a seasonal trend. The dominant size class of bacteria was seasonally variable, whereas density of filamentous bacteria was relatively high between August and September. Biomass of filamentous bacteria accounted for up to 33.6% of total bacterial biomass. A correlation analysis for cell volume of bacteria and HNF, density of filamentous bacteria and some microbial variates was performed. The positive correlations detected (p<0.05) were between density of bacteria and cell volume of HNF, and between density of filamentous bacteria and cell volume of HNF.

Motivations for chartering were basically unchanged since 2002, and fishing continued to be a secondary income source for most captains. The economy and aquatic nuisance species were included among top concerns for the future of the industry in both years.

J	Leach, JA; Hudson, DT; Moore, RD				Leach, Jason A.; Hudson, Danielle T.; Moore, R. Dan			Assessing stream temperature response and recovery for different harvesting systems in northern hardwood forests using 40 years of spot measurements	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Stream temperature is a critical control on aquatic habitat and a key forest management concern in many jurisdictions. Most research on stream temperature response to forest harvesting is from coniferous forests in rain-dominated watersheds and focused on the first few years following harvesting. In contrast, we know less about the harvesting impacts on stream temperature for silviculture approaches typically used in northern hardwood forests that are influenced by snow. We addressed this knowledge gap by using four decades (1980 to 2020) of spot water temperature measurements recorded at three treatment and two reference catchments (areas 4.5 to 69 ha) as part of a long-term water quality monitoring programme at the Turkey Lakes Watershed study near the eastern shores of Lake Superior. We were able to control for diel and seasonal biases in the spot temperature measurements and found that clearcut harvesting showed a summer temperature increase that persisted for 5 to 7 years after harvesting. Shelterwood and selection harvest did not exhibit a detectable change in stream temperature. These responses are consistent with observed changes in forest canopy through time and between harvesting approaches. In addition, the stream temperature responses were likely muted due to the streams being short and characterized by intermittent flow conditions, as well as the potential moderating influence of increased subsurface runoff following harvesting. Our results highlight how insights can be extracted from routine water quality programmes that were hitherto unrecognized.					; Hudson, Danielle/GRE-6086-2022	Leach, Jason/0000-0001-6639-7993; Hudson, Danielle/0000-0003-2775-8236													0885-6087	1099-1085				NOV	2022	36	11							e14753	10.1002/hyp.14753	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14753													WOS:000883181300001

GEORADAR AND RADIOIMPEDANCE DIAGNOSTICS OF THE SELENGA RIVER WATER AREA	GEODYNAMICS & TECTONOPHYSICS												The relevance of the work is determined by the fact that no radiowave methods have ever been used to study the water areas of rivers and lakes and their geoelectric sections within the Baikal natural territory (BNT) in winter time. The purpose of the research is to determine the electrical and geometric characteristics of the layered medium "ice - water - bottom soil" and the ice cover of the Selenga River on the BNT in the VLF-LF and VHF radio wave bands according to the data of instrumental radiophysical measurements by GPR and radio impedance methods, including the determination of the structure of the ice crossings over the Selenga River. Using the Selenga River as an example, consideration has been given to the results of combining VLF-LF and VHF methods of electromagnetic diagnostics of a layered medium in a wide range of radio waves (from tens of kilohertz to units of gigahertz). Radio impedance profiling and sounding in the VLF-LF bands with the IPI-300 equipment made it possible to determine the sub-bottom structure of the soil from the change in impedance and geoelectric section. GPR in the VHF band made it possible to differentiate the fine structure of the Selenga River in winter by thickness of snow, ice and water. The sounding involved the use of georadar "Oko-2" with antenna units "Triton" (central frequency 50 MHz), AB-400 (central frequency 400 MHz), AB-700 (central frequency 700 MHz), and AB-1700 (central frequency 1700 MHz). The thickness of ice of the road crossing in the Mostovoy microdistrict of Ulan-Ude city was 0.5-1.2 m - 0.1-0.2 m thicker than that beyond the road crossing. It was found that the presence of snow cover beyond the road crossing prevents the ice mass from freezing. Calibration sounding of ice with borehole drilling yielded ice dielectric constant e=3.17. The specific electrical resistance (SER) of water from boreholes is 71-74 Ohm center dot m at a temperature of 1 degrees C. The methods used complement each other and provide a quantitative description of the object of research. The integration of various methods of radio wave diagnostics provides more detailed information on the structure of the layered medium "ice - water - bottom soil". The obtained results and the developed methods of radio impedance and GPR sounding and profiling of an inhomogeneously layered underlying environment in winter time can be used in engineering and geological surveys in the eastern and northern regions of Russia.

The oxygen isotope record extracted from diatom silica (delta O-18(diatom)) in Lake Challa sediments captured dry conditions during the last glacial period and a wet late-glacial transition to the Holocene interrupted by Younger Dryas drought. Further, it faithfully traced gradual weakening of the southeastern monsoon during the Holocene. Overall, delta O-18(diatom) matches the branched isoprenoid tetraether (BIT) index of rainfall-induced soil runoff, except during 25-22 ka and the past 5 k.y. when insolation forcing due to orbital precession enhanced the northeastern monsoon. This pattern arises because during these two periods, a weakened southeastern monsoon reduced the amount of rainfall during the long rainy season and enhanced the opposing effect of evaporation intensity and/or length of the austral winter dry season. Importantly, our lake-based reconstruction of moisture-balance seasonality in equatorial East Africa also helps us understand the oxygen isotope record contained in Mount Kilimanjaro ice. Negative correlation between ice core delta O-18 and Lake Challa delta O-18(diatom) implies that moisture balance is not the primary climate control on the long-term trend in ice core delta O-18.					; Wolff, Christian/GPG-1449-2022; Barker, Philip/J-5938-2012	Hurrell, Elizabeth/0000-0003-4290-9047; Leng, Melanie/0000-0003-1115-5166; Cocquyt, Christine/0000-0002-0047-4180; Sloane, Hilary/0000-0001-7965-5429; Barker, Philip/0000-0002-5334-9201													0091-7613	1943-2682				DEC	2011	39	12					1111	1114		10.1130/G32419.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G32419.1													WOS:000296793900006
J	Launiainen, J; Cheng, B				Launiainen, J; Cheng, B			Modelling of ice thermodynamics in natural water bodies	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												A thermodynamic synoptic-scale sea-ice (freshwater lake) model was constructed for simulating ice thickness, ice temperature and air-ice interaction. The model includes calculation of the air-ice interface temperature and surface fluxes, as well as heat conduction in the snow and ice and heat flux and ice thickness variations at the ice-ocean boundary. Attention was given to the parameterization of the various fluxes, especially the radiative fluxes and in the calculation of the turbulent surface heat fluxes the effect of atmospheric stratification is taken into account. An iterative air-ice interface temperature serves as the key parameter controlling the surface heat balance, heat conduction and ice thickness variation at the upper surface. A conservative integral difference scheme is used to solve the heat conduction equation for an ice column consisting of 10 to 30 layers, normally in the vertical. In addition to thickness variations, the model yields the time development of the ice surface and in-ice temperatures and air-ice fluxes. The model is also able to generate the near-surface atmospheric profiles of wind, temperature and moisture. Model-calculated ice thickness and in-ice temperature variations were compared with observational data from the Bohai Sea and the Baltic Sea as a first step in verifying the model. Additionally, phenomenological process studies of subsurface melting and of the role of new snow above ice in spring is reported. The results indicate the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) dynamically coupled with the ice and heat conduction in the ice as factors responsible for controlling ice growth, except under conditions of remarkable heat fluxes from the ocean. In the spring, the role played by shortwave radiation in the surface heat balance and extinction in ice are of primary importance and control the melting. After validation, the model should be applicable and suitable for ice thermodynamics studies, for coupled air-ice-ocean models and even for climatic scenarios. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

N and P levels in the water, sediment and vegetation were also monitored. The 3 fertilization treatments were: dissolved inorganic (6200 mug l-1 N, 420 mug l-1 P), dissolved inorganic (3200 mug l-1 N, 210 mug l-1 P) and organic (ground alfalfa meal: 6200 mug l-1 N, 420 mug l-1 P). Dissolved nutrients in the inorganic treatments were quickly depleted from the water column, but dissolved N increased in the water column of the alfalfa treatment as the alfalfa decomposed. No changes in N or P concentrations in the sediments or vegetation were detected. Phytoplankton biomass increased in all fertilized enclosures while epiphytic periphyton exhibited only minor responses. Epipelon biomass increased in the alfalfa treatment and metaphyton standing crops were highest in the high inorganic treatments. In the alfalfa treatment, high microbial respiration rapidly reduced dissolved oxygen concentrations which negatively affected invertebrates. This trend reversed as oxygen levels increased later in the experiment. Dominant nektonic and benthic invertebrates increased in the high inorganic and alfalfa treatments. Orthocladiinae emergence increased in the high inorganic and alfalfa treatments, while Chironominae and Tanypodinae increased in the alfalfa treatment. Second year responses by algae and invertebrate communities to the fertilization treatments were minimal. Annual single pulse fertilization has the potential to increase the productivity of Interlake wetlands when nutrients are applied in the spring, however it should be noted that at the levels used in this study the effects did not extend to the second year.																			0018-8158					APR 1	1994	279						497	510		10.1007/BF00027880	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00027880													WOS:A1994NK39900046
J	Mataloni, G; Garraza, GG; Vinocur, A				Mataloni, Gabriela; Gonzalez Garraza, Gabriela; Vinocur, Alicia			Landscape-driven environmental variability largely determines abiotic characteristics and phytoplankton patterns in peat bog pools (Tierra del Fuego, Argentina)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Ombrotrophic peat bogs from Tierra del Fuego are characteristically raised, dome-shaped, fed by precipitation, and nutrient-poor. Their landscape pattern consists of a Sphagnum magellanicum matrix encompassing pools with different morphometric and trophic features. Within the framework of a 2-year limnological survey in five pools from Rancho Hambre peat bog, we analyzed phytoplankton communities under the hypothesis that taxonomic composition would show a spatial pattern driven by ultimately landscape-controlled environmental features such as pH and trophic status, while temperature and weather-dependent features would account for seasonal changes in abundance and structure. Among the 305 taxa recorded, most were Conjugatophyceae and Bacillariophyceae, and were strongly associated to circumneutral pH and minerotrophic conditions, though limited superficial connectivity among pools accounted for dissimilar taxonomic compositions. Despite such differences, phytoplankton of pools with similar morphometry and trophic status showed similar dominant and richest taxonomic groups undergoing paralell changes over time. Seasonal temperature fluctuations were modulated by pool size and modified not only abiotic properties but also phytoplankton abundance, with different taxa showing strong summer peaks in different pools. An interpretative model is proposed which will be tested as a tool for predicting community strategy and temporal variation patterns as responses to different environmental templates.

Its sediments contain an archive of climate and hydrologic changes during the Late Quaternary, as it is located close to the area influenced by the East-Asian summer monsoon and westerly-driven air masses. Sedimentation patterns and depositional conditions within the lake were investigated using eight sediment cores from different water depths, and this information was used to evaluate the feasibility of using a single core to reconstruct past climate and hydrological conditions. Long core H7, from the center of the lake (65 m water depth) and core H8 from a western, near-shore location (20 m water depth), were compared in detail using sediment composition and geochemical data (X-ray fluorescence, loss-on-ignition and CNS analysis). Age models were constructed using 17 AMS radiocarbon dates and indicate negligible reservoir error for sediments from the lake center and similar to 1,000 year errors for the near-shore sediment core. Cores H1-H5 and HHLS21-1 revealed a sediment succession from sand and silty clay to laminated clay on the southern side of the lake. Undisturbed, finely laminated sediments were found at water depths a parts per thousand yen15 m. Core H5 (2.5 m long), from 31 m water depth, yielded abundant green algal mats mixed with clayey lake deposits and was difficult to interpret. Algae occurred between 25 and 32 m water depth and influenced the dissolved oxygen content of the stratified lake. Comparison of cores H7 and H8 yielded prominent mismatches for different time periods, which may, in part, be attributed to internal lacustrine processes, independent of climate influence. We thus conclude that data from a single sediment core may lead to different climate inferences. Common shifts among proxy data, however, showed that major climate shifts, of regional to global significance, can be tracked and allow reconstruction of lake level changes over the last 24,000 years. Results indicate advance of glaciers into the lake basin during the LGM, at which time the lake experienced lowest levels, 25-50 m below present stage. Stepwise refilling began at ca. 16 kyr BP and reached the -25 m level during the Bolling/Allerod warm phase, ca. 13.5 kyr BP. A desiccation episode falls within the Younger Dryas, followed by a substantial lake level rise during the first millennium of the Holocene, a result of climate warming, which promoted glacier melt. By ca. 7.6 kyr BP, the lake reached a stable high stand similar to the present level, which persisted until ca. 6 kyr BP. Disturbed sediments in core H7 indicate a single mass flow that was most likely triggered by a major seismic event similar to 8.5 kyr BP. Subsequent lake development remains unclear as a consequence of data mismatches, but may indicate a general trend to deteriorating conditions and lake level lowstands at ca. 5.0-4.2, 2.0 and 0.5 kyr BP.

They are known to concentrate in cold environments as a result of progressive evaporation from warm regions, and condensation in colder regions. In this study we show that melting glaciers supply 50 to 97% of the organochlorine inputs to a subalpine lake in Alberta, Canada, while contributing 73% of input water. Tritium analyses indicated that during the mid- to late summer warm period, at least 10% of the glacial melt originated from ice that was deposited in 1950-1970, when it was more contaminated with organochlorines. This finding suggests that climate warming may cause melting glaciers to become increasing sources of contaminants to freshwaters. Organochlorines from glacial streams were largely in dissolved form because the organic-poor glacial clays had a limited sorption capacity for the more hydrophobic chemicals.					; Schindler, David/A-3752-2014; Muir, Derek/F-6183-2011; Blais, Jules/AAV-2321-2020	Lafreniere, Melissa/0000-0002-9639-6825; Muir, Derek/0000-0001-6631-9776; Blais, Jules/0000-0002-7188-3598; 													0044-7447	1654-7209				NOV	2001	30	7					410	415		10.1639/0044-7447(2001)030[0410:MGAMSO]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1639/0044-7447(2001)030[0410:MGAMSO]2.0.CO;2								11795215					WOS:000172724300003

John B.; Zhang, Enlou; Tong, Guobang			Temporally changing drivers for late-Holocene vegetation changes on the northern Tibetan Plateau	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Fossil pollen records have been widely used as indicators of past changes in vegetation and variations in climate. The driving mechanisms behind these vegetation changes have, however, remained unclear. In order to evaluate vegetation changes that have occurred in the northern part of the Tibetan Plateau and the possible drivers behind these changes, we have applied a moving-window Redundancy Analysis (RDA) to high resolution (10-15 years) pollen and sedimentary data from Lake Kusai covering the last 3770 years. Our analyses reveal frequent fluctuations in the relative abundances of alpine steppe and alpine desert components. The sedimentary proxies (including total organic carbon content, total inorganic carbon content, and "end-member" indices from grain-size analyses) that explain statistically some of the changes in the pollen assemblage vary significantly with time, most probably reflecting multiple underlying driving processes. Climate appears to have had an important influence on vegetation changes when conditions were relatively wet and stable. However, a gradual decrease in vegetation cover was identified after 1500 cal a BP, after which the vegetation appears to have been affected more by extreme events such as dust-storms or fluvial erosion than by general climatic trends. Furthermore, pollen spectra over the last 600 years are shown by Procrustes analysis to be statistically different from those recovered from older samples, which we attribute to increased human impact that resulted in unprecedented changes to the vegetation composition. Overall, changes in vegetation and climate on the northern part of the Tibetan Plateau appear to have roughly followed the evolution of the Asian Summer Monsoon. After taking into account the highly significant millennial (1512 years) periodicity revealed by time-series analysis, the regional vegetation and climate changes also show variations that appear to match variations in the mid-latitude westerlies.

Combined Genetic and Telemetry Data Reveal High Rates of Gene Flow, Migration, and Long-Distance Dispersal Potential in Arctic Ringed Seals (Pusa hispida)	PLOS ONE												Ringed seals (Pusa hispida) are broadly distributed in seasonally ice covered seas, and their survival and reproductive success is intricately linked to sea ice and snow. Climatic warming is diminishing Arctic snow and sea ice and threatens to endanger ringed seals in the foreseeable future. We investigated the population structure and connectedness within and among three subspecies: Arctic (P. hispida hispida), Baltic (P. hispida botnica), and Lake Saimaa (P. hispida saimensis) ringed seals to assess their capacity to respond to rapid environmental changes. We consider (a) the geographical scale of migration, (b) use of sea ice, and (c) the amount of gene flow between subspecies. Seasonal movements and use of sea ice were determined for 27 seals tracked via satellite telemetry. Additionally, population genetic analyses were conducted using 354 seals representative of each subspecies and 11 breeding sites. Genetic analyses included sequences from two mitochondrial regions and genotypes of 9 microsatellite loci. We found that ringed seals disperse on a pan-Arctic scale and both males and females may migrate long distances during the summer months when sea ice extent is minimal. Gene flow among Arctic breeding sites and between the Arctic and the Baltic Sea subspecies was high; these two subspecies are interconnected as are breeding sites within the Arctic subspecies.

However, few semi-analytical methods have been proposed for deriving xi from the surface remote sensing reflectance due to the variable optical state of inland waters. A semi-analytical algorithm was developed for inland waters having a wide range of turbidity and xi in this study. Application of the proposed model to Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) imagery of the water body resulted in several important observations: (1) the proposed algorithm (754 nm and 779 nm combination) was capable of retrieving xi with R2 being 0.72 (p < 0.01, n = 60), and MAPE and RMSE being 4.37% and 0.22 (n = 30) respectively; (2) the xi in HZL was lower in summer than other seasons during the period considered, this variation was driven by the phenological cycle of algae and the runoff caused by rainfall; (3) the band optimization proposed in this study is important for calculating the particle backscattering slope (eta) and deriving xi because it is feasible for both algae dominant and sediment governed turbid inland lakes. These observations help improve our understanding of the relationship between IOPs and xi, which are affected by different bio-optic processes and algal phenology in the lake environment.

Top-down effects of an invasive omnivore: detection in long-term monitoring of large-river reservoir chlorophyll-a	OECOLOGIA												Invasive species are capable of altering ecosystems through the consumption of basal resources. However, quantifying the effects of invasive species in large ecosystems is challenging. Measuring changes in basal resources (i.e., phytoplankton) at an ecosystem scale is an important and potentially translatable response vital to the understanding of how introduced species influence ecosystems. In this study, we analyzed patterns of early summer chlorophyll-a in a large-river reservoir in response to invasion of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). We used 25 years of ecological data from a 30-km reach of Kentucky Lake collected before and after silver carp establishment. We found significant decreases in chlorophyll-a within certain reservoir habitats since establishment of silver carp. Additionally, environmental and biological drivers of phytoplankton production showed no significant differences before and after invasion. These results suggest seasonal, and habitat-specific consumptive effects of invasive silver carp on an important basal food web resource. Further, our results convey the utility of long-term quantitative biological and physiochemical data in understanding ecosystem responses to elements of global change (i.e., species invasions). Importantly, the observed changes in the basal food web resource of Kentucky Lake may apply to other ecosystems facing invasion by silver carp (e.g., Laurentian Great Lakes). Our study offers insight into the mechanisms by which silver carp may influence ecosystems and furthers our understanding of invasive omnivores.

Cell concentrations increased exponentially with depth to a maximum at the sediment surface. Although the Scenedesmus cells maintained an operational photosynthetic apparatus, they occurred below the 1% light level in anoxic water. Samples from the hypolimnion could not fix C by cyclic photophosphorylation and their capacity for non-cyclic photophosphorylation was extremely low by comparison with surface populations. Thus the biomass accumulation in the hypolimnion could not be explained by photosynthetic production there.

In comparison with previous similar studies over the Great Lakes, 15 additional gauge sites, data from all seasons instead of the 4 summer months, and 8 additional years of data were used. All monthly water levels available between 1860 and 2000, as published by the U.S. National Ocean Survey and the Canadian Hydrographic Service, were used. For each lake basin, the vertical velocities of the gauge sites relative to each other were simultaneously computed, using the least-squares adjustment technique. Our algorithm solves for and removes a monthly bias common to all sites, as well as site-specific biases. It also properly weighs the input water levels, resulting in a realistic estimation of the uncertainties in tilting parameters. The relative velocities obtained for each lake were then combined to obtain relative velocities over the entire Great Lakes region. Finally, the gradient of the relative rates for the regional model was found to agree best with the ICE-3G global isostatic model of Tushingham and Peltier, whereas the ICE-4G gradients were too small around the Great Lakes.																			0016-7606	1943-2674				JUL-AUG	2005	117	7-8					1070	1080		10.1130/B25392.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B25392.1													WOS:000229991100016

This paper adopted the data products of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, boarding on NASA satellites of Terra and Aqua) to analyze temporal process and spatial extension of this Drought in PLW. MODIS-derived Normalized Difference Water Deviation Index (NWDI, for short) was calculated to examine the water balance of soil against background level, which was expressed with the NDWI average during 2000 similar to 2007. Though the Poyang Lake experienced sharp shrinkage in water area, the region near the Lake didn't show corresponsive serious water stress in NDWDI image series. This fact lies in that though the river runoff into the Lake decreased obviously, the soil of lake basin was exposed to less 1 water stress as the low terrain can easily supply water balance via ground flux.

Precipitation can scavenge levoglucosan from the atmosphere to the Earth's surface. However, almost no previous research has investigated the variability of levoglucosan in precipitation. This research reports levoglucosan records in precipitation samples collected from March 2018 to September 2019 in Lhasa, on the southern Tibetan Plateau. Although the event-based levoglucosan variations seem random, the variability on monthly or seasonal time scales is highly correlated to vegetation fire changes along the Himalayas and surrounding regions. In addition, extreme wildfires in southern Central Asia also affect levoglucosan records in precipitation at Lhasa, especially during the summer. Our results indicate that local vegetation fires are not the major sources of levoglucosan in precipitation in Lhasa.

Eruptive history of the Barombi Mbo Maar, Cameroon Volcanic Line, Central Africa: Constraints from volcanic facies analysis	CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												his study presents the first and detail field investigations of exposed deposits at proximal sections of the Barombi Mbo Maar (BMM), NE Mt Cameroon, with the aim of documenting its past activity, providing insight on the stratigraphic distribution, depositional process, and evolution of the eruptive sequences during its formation. Field evidence reveals that the BMM deposit is about 126m thick, of which about 20m is buried lowermost under the lake level and covered by vegetation. Based on variation in pyroclastic facies within the deposit, it can be divided into three main stratigraphic units: U-1, U-2 and U-3. Interpretation of these features indicates that U-1 consists of alternating lapilli-ash-lapilli beds series, in which fallout derived individual lapilli-rich beds are demarcated by surges deposits made up of thin, fine-grained and consolidated ash-beds that are well-defined, well-sorted and laterally continuous in outcrop scale. U-2, a pyroclastic fall-derived unit, shows crudely lenticular stratified scoriaceous layers, in which many fluidal and spindle bombs-rich lapilli-beds are separated by very thin, coarse-vesiculatedash-beds, overlain by a mantle xenolith- and accidental lithic-rich explosive breccia, and massive lapilli tuff and lapillistone. U3 displays a series of surges and pyroclastic fall layers. Emplacement processes were largely controlled by fallout deposition and turbulent diluted pyroclastic density currents under "dry" and "wet" conditions. The eruptive activity evolved in a series of initial phreatic eruptions, which gradually became phreatomagmatic, followed by a phreato-Strombolian and a violent phreatomagmatic fragmentation. A relatively long-time break, demonstrated by a paleosol between U-2 and U-3, would have permitted the feeding of the root zone or the prominent crater by the water that sustained the next eruptive episode, dominated by subsequent phreatomagmatic eruptions. These preliminary results require complementary studies, such as geochemistry, for a better understanding of the changes in the eruptive styles, and to develop more constraints on the maar's polygenetic origin.

The total content of NPEOn (n=1-15) bound onto the sediment of this lake changed in the range of 60.7-631.5 mu g/kg-dry with the horizontal flow direction and the vertical direction of the sediment cores with sediment thickness up to 35 cm. Compared to the presence levels of all detected NPEOn species, the content of NP was much higher, falling in 26.5-1,998.4 mu g/kg-dry. A general increasing trend of the NP content along the water flow direction of this lake was revealed. NPEnC showed a roughly increasing trend from the upstream to the downstream, with the total concentrations being obviously lower than NPEOn and NP and falling in 2.13-23.1 mu g/kg-dry. The short chain NPEOn dominant in NPEO mixtures in these sedimentary cores indicated that this lake received some effluents from STPs, and the sewage treatment ratio is relatively low in this area. Furthermore, the computed magnitudes of NPEO1-2/NPEO1-15, NP/NPEO1-15 and NPEC1-10/NPEO1-15 suggested that the non-oxidative hydrolytic transformation seemed to be a major process occurring within the sediment phase of Nansi Lake, while the oxidative hydrolytic transformation pathway was probably less involved.																			1022-6680		978-3-03785-267-5				2012	356-360		1-5				1733	+		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.356-360.1733	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.356-360.1733													WOS:000302888300337

Winter fasting and emaciation, which are common among Arctic charr living in high latitudes, resulted in a redistribution of the lipophilic PCBs from lipid-storing tissue such as the muscle, to vital organs that must be considered sensitive toward PCB ( liver and brain). This redistribution was accompanied by a significant potentiation of the hepatic cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 1A biomarker response, from low activities in October ( within those measured in uncontaminated charr) to a high, probably maximum, induction in May. Performance studies demonstrated a clear effect of environmentally realistic PCB levels on endocrine mechanisms, immune function, and seawater preadaptation ( smoltification) in charr that had been feed deprived for several months after contamination with Aroclor 1254, whereas a high PCB dose exerted only minor, if any, effects in charr that had been fed after contamination. These results demonstrate that emaciation results in decreased dose-response relationships in fish, and indicate that arctic animals undergoing seasonal cycles of "fattening" and emaciation may be extra sensitive toward persistent, lipophilic organochlorines. Pilot studies on Arctic charr from Bjornoya Island revealed marked CYP1A biomarker responses and an upregulation of genes involved in cellular homeostatic mechanisms in charr from Lake Ellasjoen ( high PCB levels).					; Vijayan, Mathilakath/AAC-2190-2020; Aluru, Neelakanteswar/A-7237-2009	Vijayan, Mathilakath/0000-0002-4300-1965; 													1528-7394	1087-2620				JAN 8	2006	69	1-2					37	52		10.1080/15287390500259053	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15287390500259053								16291561					WOS:000235147500003

The results showed the following: (a) The SSECEs occurred frequently before 1991, but less thereafter, with an increase after 2018. The first two interdecadal modes of the SSECE frequency were east-west inverse and "n" patterns. (b) The interdecadal abrupt change of the "n" pattern occurred around 1997/1998. Before 1997/1998, the synergistic effects between the positive Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (+IPO) and the negative North Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (-AMO) triggered the "two troughs and one ridge" anomalous circulation in Eurasia. The Rossby wave energy propagated downstream from the Atlantic, strengthening the Lake Baikal ridge. Furthermore, the Siberian High (SH) became weaker in the north and stronger in the south. With the favorable jet conditions, the cold air invaded North China along the northerly airflow in front of the Lake Baikal ridge, resulting in the frequent SSECE occurrence in central North China. Afterwards, the opposite occurred. (c) The cooperation of SST anomalies (SSTAs) led to the east-west inverse anomaly of the SSECE frequency. Before 1991, the high SSTAs in the central North Atlantic and low SSTAs in the equatorial Indian Ocean and the southwest Pacific triggered "+", "-", "+", and "-" wave trains at mid-latitudes from the Atlantic to the North Pacific. The Rossby wave energy propagated eastward from the Atlantic, resulting in the SH and Urals ridge strengthening, and the Aleutian Low and East Asian trough deepening. The northwestern airflow in front of the Urals ridge guided the cold air into North China, leading to frequent SSECEs in central and eastern North China before 1991. The opposite occurred between 1992 and 2018.																				2073-4433				NOV	2023	14	11							1699	10.3390/atmos14111699	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos14111699													WOS:001108189200001

The two new species are easily distinguished from described congeners in the area by external morphology, allopatric distributions, and genetic markers. Chiloglanis kerioensis sp. nov., is restricted to the Kerio River system and is the only known suckermouth catfish from the Lake Turkana basin. Chiloglanis devosi sp. nov., is known only from the type locality, the Northern Ewaso Nyiro (Ng'iro) below Chanler's Falls. In addition to these two new species, this study confirmed the presence of an undescribed Chiloglanis sp. occurring sympatrically with Chiloglanis brevibarbis in the Tsavo River.

Seasonal variations of rotifers from a high altitude urban shallow water body, La Cantera Oriente (Mexico City, Mexico)	CHINESE JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY												La Cantera Oriente is a shallow freshwater volcanic water body located at an altitude of 2 270 m above sea level in the Ecological Reserve of San Angel Pedregal of Mexico City (Mexico). In order to ensure the conservation of its biological heritage including zooplankton, the present work was undertaken to quantify the seasonal changes in the diversity and density of rotifers and the selected physico-chemical variables during 2013-2014. Qualitative analysis of the zooplankton samples yielded 68 rotifer species which represented 24 genera in 15 families. B rachionus calyciflorus Pallas, 1766, B. quadridentatus Hermann, 1783, Polyarthra vulgaris Carlin, 1943, Lecane closterocerca (Schmarda, 1859) and Keratella cochlearis (Gosse, 1851) were the most common species. Preston plots of species frequency-density revealed that as many as 30% of the rotifer taxa were dominant throughout the year. The species with high population densities were Brachionus quadridentatus, Lecane closterocerca, Keratella cochlearis, and Lepadella patella; their peak densities were 2 000, 1 000, 180 and 90 ind./L, all occurring in summer. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that Platyias quadricornis was related to the concentration of phosphates available in the environment and the conductivity, while B. quadridentatus was positively correlated with chlorophyll-a. The trophic status of the lake was eutrophic based on Chl-a content but oligotrophic with relation to the Brachionus:Trichocerca ratio.

To gain insights into the long-term spatiotemporal changes from 1992 to 2015 regarding groundwater resources in Kumamoto, southern Japan, we analyzed climatological time series, discharge from the groundwater-fed lake (Ezu Lake), and groundwater levels from 94 wells. To explicitly detect temporal changes in these variables and assess potential drivers of change, we used three different trend analyses: the Mann-Kendall Test (MKT), Seasonal Mann-Kendall Test (SMKT), and Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA). Our results revealed a consistently increasing trend in monthly mean temperature, monthly total precipitation, and maximum hourly rainfall. However, a decreasing trend was detected for the discharge rate from the Ezu Lake from 1992 to 2015. Among the 94 investigated groundwater wells, 64 wells showed an upward trend (p <= 0.05), while 23 wells showed a downward trend (p <= 0.05) for groundwater level. The observed decline in groundwater level is related to the decline in Ezu Lake discharge. However, the increase for the majority of groundwater wells is related to the increased precipitation and applied artificial groundwater recharge as well as a decrease in the groundwater abstraction rate. The ITA outperformed both SMKT and MKT, particularly in detecting minor variations in hydrological time-series data. The results and approach presented in this study can provide a scientific basis for improve groundwater accounting and water resources management in Kumamoto area and other regions with similar climate and socioeconomic conditions.					; Hosono, Takahiro/LTE-0466-2024; Nakagawa, Kei/E-7150-2013; Berndtsson, Ronny/C-7449-2015	Berndtsson, Ronny/0000-0003-1473-0138; Nakagawa, Kei/0000-0003-0071-0785; Hosono, Takahiro/0000-0001-7200-7912; Yu, Zhi-Qiang/0000-0002-2259-0174													0920-4741	1573-1650				SEP	2024	38	11					4161	4177		10.1007/s11269-024-03857-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-024-03857-1		APR 2024											WOS:001204635600001

Influence of Long-Distance Climate Teleconnection on Seasonality of Water Temperature in the World's Largest Lake - Lake Baikal, Siberia	PLOS ONE												Large-scale climate change is superimposed on interacting patterns of climate variability that fluctuate on numerous temporal and spatial scales-elements of which, such as seasonal timing, may have important impacts on local and regional ecosystem forcing. Lake Baikal in Siberia is not only the world's largest and most biologically diverse lake, but it has exceptionally strong seasonal structure in ecosystem dynamics that may be dramatically affected by fluctuations in seasonal timing. We applied time-frequency analysis to a near-continuous, 58-year record of water temperature from Lake Baikal to examine how seasonality in the lake has fluctuated over the past half century and to infer underlying mechanisms. On decadal scales, the timing of seasonal onset strongly corresponds with deviation in the zonal wind intensity as described by length of day (LOD); on shorter scales, these temperature patterns shift in concert with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Importantly, the connection between ENSO and Lake Baikal is gated by the cool and warm periods of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Large-scale climatic phenomena affecting Siberia are apparent in Lake Baikal surface water temperature data, dynamics resulting from jet stream and storm track variability in central Asia and across the Northern Hemisphere.					; Katz, Stephen/KGL-4557-2024	Hampton, Stephanie/0000-0003-2389-4249; 													1932-6203					FEB 16	2011	6	2							e14688	10.1371/journal.pone.0014688	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014688								21359207					WOS:000287392700005
J	Robinson, SA; Erickson, DJ				Robinson, Sharon A.; Erickson, David J., III			Not just about sunburn - the ozone hole's profound effect on climate has significant implications for Southern Hemisphere ecosystems	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Climate scientists have concluded that stratospheric ozone depletion has been a major driver of Southern Hemisphere climate processes since about 1980. The implications of these observed and modelled changes in climate are likely to be far more pervasive for both terrestrial and marine ecosystems than the increase in ultraviolet-B radiation due to ozone depletion; however, they have been largely overlooked in the biological literature. Here, we synthesize the current understanding of how ozone depletion has impacted Southern Hemisphere climate and highlight the relatively few documented impacts on terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Reviewing the climate literature, we present examples of how ozone depletion changes atmospheric and oceanic circulation, with an emphasis on how these alterations in the physical climate system affect Southern Hemisphere weather, especially over the summer season (December-February). These potentially include increased incidence of extreme events, resulting in costly floods, drought, wildfires and serious environmental damage. The ecosystem impacts documented so far include changes to growth rates of South American and New Zealand trees, decreased growth of Antarctic mosses and changing biodiversity in Antarctic lakes. The objective of this synthesis was to stimulate the ecological community to look beyond ultraviolet-B radiation when considering the impacts of ozone depletion. Such widespread changes in Southern Hemisphere climate are likely to have had as much or more impact on natural ecosystems and food production over the past few decades, than the increased ultraviolet radiation due to ozone depletion.

J	SARNELLE, O				SARNELLE, O			CONTRASTING EFFECTS OF DAPHNIA ON RATIOS OF NITROGEN TO PHOSPHORUS IN A EUTROPHIC, HARD-WATER LAKE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Daphnia manipulation in large enclosures, and whole-lake observations before and after a fishkill, showed that intense Daphnia grazing produces large elevations in particulate N:P ratios (PN:PP) during clear-water periods in a eutrophic lake. The direction of this effect was consistent with expected taxonomic variation among zooplankton in the N:P of excretion. N and P sedimentation (mg m-2 d-1) was reduced during Daphnia-induced, clear-water periods, despite increases in particle sinking velocities. In addition, there was an unexpected difference between seston N:P and the N:P of settled particles during clear water, resulting in a differential increase in average sinking velocity calculated for PP relative to PN. Daphnia effects on N: P later in the season appeared to be opposite to those during clear water. My data suggest that Daphnia grazing can reduce carbonate precipitation (whitings) by controlling algal biomass. Whitings were accompanied by large increases in sedimentary loss rates for total P (TP) and elevated TN: TP in the euphotic zone. Thus, Daphnia grazing may maintain relatively low TN:TP during summer in eutrophic, hard-water lakes.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	1992	37	7					1527	1542		10.4319/lo.1992.37.7.1527	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1992.37.7.1527													WOS:A1992KM34100013

Six sakis were observed on Round Island in Guri Lake, Venezuela, between March and May 1996. These months are considered the dry season and the beginning of the wet season. Sakis specialize in eating seeds. During the present study only one tree species, Licania discolor (Chrysobalanaceae), fruited in substantial numbers. Licania seeds accounted for 88% of the time the sakis spent eating fruit in March, 87% in April, and 80% in May. We estimate that the sakis' intake of Licanta seeds dropped from 2,573 seeds in the 15-day observation period in March to 956 seeds in the 16-day observation period in May. The sakis not only spent less time eating Licania, they ate the seeds at a much slower rate. The drop in the sakis' feeding rate was probably due to increased local search and inspection times. In response to the scarcity of fruit, the sakis ate more young leaves, insects, and flowers. Feeding bouts became more frequent but shorter. Mean distances between feeding bouts fell significantly and the sakis revisited trees less often.

Using morphological characteristics, we identified the collected samples as C. flavicans. Also, we compared the distribution of C. flavicans, Daphnia rosea and chlorophyll a to observed seasonal dynamics. The increase of C. flavicans was observed 1-2 weeks after the increase of D. rosea. Survey of diel vertical migration patterns in the summer season showed that C. flavicans were in hypolimnion at daytime, but moved to the epilimnion at night. Finally, to determine trophic relationships in Sang-Chun reservoir, additional studies on the food web were undertaken by stable isotope analysis. Chaoborus flavicans I-II instars appear to be filter feeders based on carbon isotope values. Trophic levels of C. flavicans III-IV instars were shown to be higher than other zooplankton based on nitrogen isotope values.

J	Diallo, I; Giorgi, F; Stordal, F				Diallo, Ismaila; Giorgi, Filippo; Stordal, Frode			Influence of Lake Malawi on regional climate from a double-nested regional climate model experiment	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												We evaluate the performance of the regional climate model (RCM) RegCM4 coupled to a one dimensional lake model for Lake Malawi (also known as Lake Nyasa in Tanzania and Lago Niassa in Mozambique) in simulating the main characteristics of rainfall and near surface air temperature patterns over the region. We further investigate the impact of the lake on the simulated regional climate. Two RCM simulations, one with and one without Lake Malawi, are performed for the period 1992-2008 at a grid spacing of 10 km by nesting the model within a corresponding 25 km resolution run ("mother domain") encompassing all Southern Africa. The performance of the model in simulating the mean seasonal patterns of near surface air temperature and precipitation is good compared with previous applications of this model. The temperature biases are generally less than 2.5 A degrees C, while the seasonal cycle of precipitation over the region matches observations well. Moreover, the one-dimensional lake model reproduces fairly well the geographical pattern of observed (from satellite measurements) lake surface temperature as well as its mean month-to-month evolution. The Malawi Lake-effects on the moisture and atmospheric circulation of the surrounding region result in an increase of water vapor mixing ratio due to increased evaporation in the presence of the lake, which combines with enhanced rising motions and low-level moisture convergence to yield a significant precipitation increase over the lake and neighboring areas during the whole austral summer rainy season.

The heavy bloom not only threatens the steady-state equilibrium of the eutrophic system of the Lake but also must accelerate the Lake transformation into a low moor by forming ooze on the lake bottom with the precipitation of a large amount of dead blue-green algae.																			0049-6979	1573-2932					1979	12	3					383	391		10.1007/BF01047024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01047024													WOS:A1979JA19600010

Accurate solar radiation (SR) estimates are therefore needed in solar energy applications. Firstly, two deep learning models, including gated recurrent unit (GRU) and long short-term memory (LSTM), were developed in this study. Next, a data pre-processing technique named multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) was used to construct the MVMD-GRU and MVMD-LSTM hybrid models. To better test the performance of proposed simple and hybrid models, four stations located in the Illinois State of the USA (i.e., Dixon Springs, Fairfield, Rend Lake, and Carbondale) were considered as the study sites. Whole the simple and hybrid models were established under two different strategies, i.e., local and external. In the local strategy, SR of each location was estimated using the minimum and maximum air temperatures from the same station. While, minimum and maximum air temperatures as well as SR data from the nearby station were utilized in external strategy to estimate SR time series of any target site. Root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2) 2 ) metrics were used when evaluating the models performances. The overall results revealed that the proposed MVMD-GRU and MVMD-LSTM hybrid models illustrated better SR estimates compared to the simple GRU and LSTM in both the local and external strategies. The values of error metrics obtained for the superior hybrid models (i.e., MVMDLSTM) during the testing period were as: RMSE = 2.532 MJ/m2.day, 2 .day, MAE = 1.921 MJ/m2.day, 2 .day, R2 2 = 0.916 at Dixon Springs; RMSE = 2.476 MJ/m2.day, 2 .day, MAE = 1.878 MJ/m2.day, 2 .day, R2 2 = 0.921 at Fairfield; RMSE = 2.359 MJ/ m2.day, 2 .day, MAE = 1.780 MJ/m2.day, 2 .day, R2 2 = 0.924 at Rend Lake; RMSE = 2.576 MJ/m2.day, 2 .day, MAE = 1.941 MJ/m2. 2 . day, R2 2 = 0.914 at Carbondale. Therefore, the coupled models proposed in this study can be possibly recommended as suitable alternatives to the simple deep learning models with a reliable precision in estimating SR time series.

We quantified seasonal DOC and solute fluxes under different redox conditions, in a small drinking water reservoir using sediment core incubations. Processes governing benthic DOC exchange were microbial production of DOC and interaction with mineral surfaces. Mobilization of DOC in anoxic sediments seemed to be closely linked to reductive dissolution of ferric minerals as shown by the strong positive correlation (r(2) = 0.99) between DOC and Fe fluxes. Oxidized surface sediments were an efficient DOC trap where DOC was bound to ferric minerals. Redox conditions appeared to be the primary regulator of the DOC exchange, resulting in sedimentary uptake of DOC (-1.8 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) only under oxic conditions. DOC production was regulated by temperature, leading to higher DOC fluxes (up to 2.4 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) in summer. The sediment was a net sink of DOC (20.2 tonnes yr(-1)) but this was small compared with the annual DOC load (15 tonnes yr(-1)) of the reservoir. However, the benthic DOC flux was about 10-20% of the dissolved carbon flux at the sediment-water interface, making it a significant process in the lake internal carbon cycle. Climate change is supposed to promote reducing conditions at the bottom of lakes, which might increase benthic DOC production in the future.

Variable demographics and consumption requirements of Bythotrephes longimanus (Crustacea, Cercopagididae) along a nearshore to offshore gradient in Lake Michigan	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Demographic differences in Bythotrephes longimanus populations are often used to infer the prevalence of different environmental conditions that regulate their population. We collected seasonal data on Bythotrephes abundance and life history at a nearshore (15m), transitional (45m) and offshore site (110m) in Lake Michigan during 2007-2016. Due to higher fish predation requirements and the small size of zooplankton prey at the nearshore site, we expected life-history attributes of Bythotrephes would differ compared to the deeper sites, but body and spine length, percent of growth allocated to the spine, and brood size were similar among depths. Owing to higher abundances in the offshore, the ratio of consumption requirements: prey production (C:P) was relatively high throughout the growing season at the deepest site compared to the two shallower sites, where C:P was generally only high in the fall. However, reproductive characteristics of Bythotrephes at the offshore site did not reflect a food-limited population compared to the other two sites. Rather the proportion of barren females was higher at the nearshore site than those at the deeper sites, leading to much lower birth rates and abundance of Bythotrephes at the shallow site compared to the deeper sites.

This MS networking approach is particularly well-suited for the detection of new cyanotoxin variants and resulted in the discovery of three new cyclic peptides, namely microcystin-MhtyR (6), which comprised about half of the total microcystin content in the bloom, and ferintoic acids C (12) and D (13). Structure elucidation of 6 was aided by a new microscale methylation procedure. Metagenomic analysis of the bloom using the 16S-ITS rRNA region identified Microcystis aeruginosa as the predominant cyanobacterium in the sample. Fragments of the putative biosynthetic genes for the new cyanotoxins were also identified, and their sequences correlated to the structure of the isolated cyanotoxins.					; Teta, Roberta/C-8359-2011; Costantino, Valeria/AAN-1960-2020; Della Sala, Gerardo/K-1805-2018; Glukhov, Evgenia/ABB-2769-2020; Mangoni, Alfonso/A-3554-2012	TETA, Roberta/0000-0003-0817-7743; Della Sala, Gerardo/0000-0001-8957-3259; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				DEC 15	2015	49	24					14301	14310		10.1021/acs.est.5b04415	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.5b04415								26567695					WOS:000366872300048

Diets and Stable Isotope Signatures of Native and Nonnative Leucisid Fishes Advances Our Understanding of the Yellowstone Lake Food Web	FISHES												(1) Many forage fishes, such as Leucisids (minnows) have depauperate studies on diet composition or stable isotope signatures, as these fishes are often only viewed as food for higher trophic levels. The need exists to understand and document the diet and stable isotope signatures of Leucisids (redside shiner, longnose dace, lake chub) in relation to the community ecology and food-web dynamics in Yellowstone Lake, especially given an invasive piscivore introduction and potential future effects of climate change on the Yellowstone Lake ecosystem. (2) Diet data collected during summer of 2020 were analyzed by species using proportion by number, frequency of occurrence, and mean proportion by weight, and diet overlap was compared using Schoener's index (D). Stable isotope (delta N-15 and delta C-13) values were estimated by collecting tissue during the summer of 2020 by species, and isotopic overlap was compared using 40% Bayesian ellipses. (3) Nonnative redside shiners and lake chub had similar diets, and native longnose dace diet differed from the nonnative Leucisids. Diet overlap was also higher between the nonnative Leucisids, and insignificant when comparing native and nonnative Leucisids. No evidence existed to suggest a difference in delta N-15 signatures among the species. Longnose dace had a mean delta C-13 signature of -15.65, indicating an decreased reliance on pelagic prey compared to nonnative Leucisids. Nonnative redside shiners and lake chub shared 95% of isotopic niche space, but stable isotope overlap was <25% for comparisons between native longnose dace and the nonnative Leucisids. (4) This study established the diet composition and stable isotope signatures of Leusicids residing in Yellowstone Lake, thus expanding our knowledge of Leucisid feeding patterns and ecology in relation to the native and nonnative species in the ecosystem. We also expand upon our knowledge of Leucisids in North America. Additionally, quantifying minnow diets can provide a baseline for understanding food web response to invasive suppression management actions.

Black carbon aerosol in winter northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China: the source, mixing state and optical property	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Black carbon (BC) aerosol at high altitudes of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau has potential effects on the regional climate and hydrological cycle. An intensive measurement campaign was conducted at Qinghai Lake (similar to 3200m above sea level) at the edge of the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau during winter using a ground-based single particle soot photometer (SP2) and a photoacoustic extinctiometer (PAX). The average concentration of refractory BC (rBC) and number fraction of coated rBC were found to be 160 +/- 190 ng m(-3) and 59 % for the entire campaign, respectively. Significant enhancements of rBC loadings and number fraction of coated rBC were observed during a pollution episode, with an average value of 390 ng m(-3) and 65 %, respectively. The mass size distribution of rBC particles showed log-normal distribution, with a peak diameter of similar to 187 nm regardless of the pollution level. Five-day backward trajectory analysis suggests that the air masses from north India contributed to the increased rBC loadings during the campaign. The potential source contribution function (PSCF) model combined with the fire counts map further proves that biomass burning from north India is an important potential source influencing the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau during the pollution episode. The rBC mass absorption cross section (MAC(rBC)) at lambda = 532 nm was slightly larger in clean days (14.9 m(2) g(-1)) than during the pollution episode (9.3 m(2) g(-1)), likely due to the effects of brown carbon and the uncertainty of the MACrBC calculation. The MACrBC was positively correlated with number fraction of coated rBC during the pollution episode with an increasing rate of 0.18 (m(2) g(-1)) %(-1). The number fraction of coated rBC particles showed positive correlation with light absorption, suggesting that the increase of coated rBC particles will enhance the light absorption. Compared to rBC mass concentration, rBC mixing sate is more important in determining absorption during the pollution episode, estimated from the same percentage-wise increment of either rBC mass concentration or the number fraction of coated rBC. The estimated BC direct radiative forcing was +0.93 W m(-2) for the pollution episode, which is 2 times larger than that in clean days. Our study provides insight into the potential climatic impacts of rBC aerosol transported to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau from south Asian regions, and is also useful for future modeling studies.

Whenever a water related pollution incident happens, the rapid identification of the pollution sources could greatly help in its management. Various techniques and methods have been proposed for this purpose; here, we propose a spectral fingerprinting and differentiation method for water samples using machine learning (ML) based on surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). To simulate the discharge of wastewater into waterbodies, surface water (lake water) was spiked with landfill leachate and domestic sewage (as pollution sources) at different COD gradients, respectively. Two SERS protocols were evaluated for extracting Raman features from the wastewater samples. The collected SERS spectra were subjected to different ML methods for best differentiation results. These results demonstrated for the first time that by tuning the surface adsorption on the SERS substrate, SERS combined with ML can extract spectral fingerprint features to identify and distinguish water pollution sources.

Estimating the global flux of methane into the atmosphere and its seasonal variations	IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS												A new method of estimating the global fluxes of methane into the Earth's atmosphere is proposed. This method allows one to take into account the whole spectrum of methane sources irrespectively of their location and calculate seasonal variations in methane fluxes. The results of numerical calculations of the amount of methane emitted into the atmosphere on the basis of this method are supported by data obtained from field measurements. In the Northern Hemisphere (NH), during fall, maximum concentrations of CH4 are due to methane sources in the arctic region which have not been taken into account before. For the condition of balance between the emission and sink of methane to be fulfilled, the total capacity of its sources amounts to no less than similar to 530 Tg/year for the NH and similar to 470 Tg/year for the Southern Hemisphere (SH). The results of our calculations and an analysis of the behavior of the concentration and mass of methane in the Earth's hemispheres show that the global flux of methane from the surfaces of the lithosphere and ocean into the atmosphere may amount to more than similar to 1000 Tg/year.																			0001-4338	1555-628X				MAR	2013	49	2					128	136		10.1134/S0001433813020023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0001433813020023													WOS:000317980900003

The zooplankton of the hypertrophic Laguna ChascomA(0)s (Argentina) is generally dominated by rotifers and cyclopoids copepods. An unusual dominance by small-cladocerans was observed after a massive winter fish kill in 2007. We hypothesized that small-cladocerans would increase the grazing pressure on heterotrophic flagellates (HF), reducing the degree of coupling between HF and picoplankton. The aim of this study was to investigate the microbial food web structure under two contrasting zooplankton assemblages. The lake was sampled every other week between 2007 and 2009. The abundances of heterotrophic bacteria (HB) and picocyanobacteria (Pcy) laid among the highest values reported for aquatic systems (> 10(8) and 10(7) cells ml(-1), respectively). Pcy averaged 53% of total picoplanktonic biomass. When small-cladocerans dominated zooplankton HF reached the higher abundance (> 10(5) cells ml(-1)) and picoplankton showed the opposite pattern, while the proportion of grazing resistant morphologies (i.e. microaggregates of Pcy) was higher. In contrast, when rotifers dominated, HF abundance decreased and picoplankton increased. Our data suggest that the degree of HF-HB coupling was affected by changes in zooplankton dominance. In contrast to our initial hypothesis, the present results suggest that large numbers of rotifers (> 5,000 ind. l(-1)) are more efficient than small-cladocerans at controlling HF populations.					; Torremorell, Ana/AAS-3083-2021	Zagarese, Horacio/0000-0001-6588-5960; Unrein, Fernando/0000-0002-8592-1858; Diovisalvi, Nadia/0000-0002-1054-8323; Torremorell, Ana/0000-0003-3903-6863													0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2013	714	1					115	130		10.1007/s10750-013-1528-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-013-1528-3													WOS:000320843100011

Catchment-Scale Shifts in the Magnitude and Partitioning of Carbon Export in Response to Changing Hydrologic Connectivity in a Northern Hardwood Forest	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The capacity of forest soils to store organic carbon is influenced by changing hydrologic connectivity. We hypothesized that hydrologic connectivity, the water-mediated transfer of matter and energy between different landscape positions, controls the partitioning between aquatic and atmospheric soil carbon fates. Results from a 5-year study of a northern hardwood forested catchment indicated that hydrologic connectivity affected both the magnitude and fate of carbon export. Atmospheric carbon export was the major export pathway from the catchment; its rate was regulated by topographic position (i.e., uplands, ecotones, and wetlands) but enhanced or supressed through changes in soil moisture and hydrologic connectivity. Wetter soil conditions reduced CO2 flux from the ecotones and wetlands where microbial respiration was oxygen-limited, whereas drier soil conditions that decreased hydrologic connectivity increased CO2 flux by relieving the oxygen limitation. In contrast, aquatic carbon export was a minor export pathway from the catchment and was driven by hydrologic connectivity, with less carbon export during relatively low discharge years. Past trends suggest a shift to a warmer climate and changes in the timing, duration, and intensity of hydrologic connectivity that are leading to an increase in annual atmospheric carbon export but a decrease in annual aquatic carbon export, despite the intensification of autumn storms. The increase in atmospheric carbon export creates a positive feedback for climate warming that will further disrupt hydrologic connectivity and aquatic carbon export, with consequences for downstream streams and lakes.

Concentrations of total Hg in precipitation were measured, and the spatial and temporal variations of Hg were addressed. The results show that Hg concentrations (median = 92 ng L-1) are comparable to the reports of other cities in China, but higher than those of remote sites. In spatial, Hg levels are significantly higher in urban and suburban precipitation than in rural samples. The pH, precipitation depth and antecedent drying period appear to be potential factors influencing Hg concentrations in precipitation, but in general no strong correlation was found between Hg and individual parameters. A seasonal variation of Hg in precipitation was found, and the concentrations in winter are generally higher, possibly associated with fossil fuel combustion. In addition, the dominant wind direction was found to be a factor influencing seasonal pattern of Hg by atmospheric transport of air pollutants. The backward trajectories suggest that local sources, for example, emissions from coal combustion and industry activities, are possibly important contributors to Hg in precipitation.					wang, shuxiao/H-5990-2011	wang, shuxiao/0000-0001-9727-1963													1600-0889						2015	67								25660	10.3402/tellusb.v67.25660	http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/tellusb.v67.25660													WOS:000358677800001
J	ALLEN, DL				ALLEN, DL			HUNTING AS A LIMITATION TO MICHIGAN PHEASANT POPULATIONS	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Hunting records are analyzed for 2 areas of Michigan farmland totalling nearly 10,000 acres. Seven years of hunting at the Rose Lake Wildlife Expt. Station in Clinton County and 9 yrs. at the Prairie Farm in Saginaw County indicate that there is little danger of overshooting the ring-necked pheasant. Both areas have good escape cover. The hunting season during the study was 22 days, from Oct. 15 to Nov. 5. The daily bag limit was two cocks. Hunting pressures on the study areas varied from 99 to 256 gun-hours per hundred acres, as compared with 40-60 gun-hours for private farms. The pheasant crop depends upon breeding season production as governed by spring weather more than any other factor. Heavy shooting of cocks had no adverse effect upon the population. Hunting trends were consistent regardless of population level. Approx. 70% of the pheasant kill is taken the 1st week, 20% the 2d, and 10% the last 8 days. In this state there is no need for refuges to preserve cock pheasants from shooting or for the restocking of cocks as breeders.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1947	11	3					232	243		10.2307/3796281	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3796281													WOS:A1947XS08500005

However, recent climate change and human activities exerted strong pressures on this ecosystem. In this paper, we applied object-based image analysis (OBIA) and RadomForests (RF) classifier to ten Landsat images to examine the land cover composition and its change during 1987-2017 low water season at Poyang Lake. NDVI time series (2000-2017) derived from MODIS imagery was used to document the changes of vegetation growth status. To investigate the potential drivingmechanismof the inundation patterns, we differentiated the spatial-temporal changes of vegetation coverage and NDVI accumulation on eight elevation bands. Major result indicates that the vegetation area increased by 15.5% of the lake area during 1987-2017. A much faster-increasing rate (58.0 km(2) year(-1)) can be observed during 2001-2009 as compared to that of the overall study period (18.4 km(2) year(-1)). Analysis of NDVI accumulation showed that 42.1% of the lake's area displayed a significant increasing trend during 2000-2017. Spatially, the increase of vegetation area and NDVI accumulation mainly took place in the 11-12 m elevation band in the lower lake center. Early dry season and prolonged exposure period after the operation of Three Gorges Dam(TGD) was themajor reason for the spatio-temporal evolution of the wetland vegetation in Poyang Lake. The Lake'swater level started to fall below 12 m before 9th November might cause a boost of vegetation growth in the low lake center, and in turn, triggering xerophilization for the vegetation in the highlands and a shift in foraging patterns ofwaterbirds due to phenology variations. The findings of this study provide a clear reference for sustaining the inter-annual stability of the ecosystem by controlling the depth of water in the lake. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

As a time marker, we used an artificial marl layer that was deposited by a remediation program in the year 1995. A portion of the sediment deposited during the year was transported from the littoral and the top of the submerged hills to the foot of the slope, where we found the greatest deposition. Within the same lake, the deposited sediment layer varied by a factor of 4 between minimal and maximal values over the same time periods. Lake Arendsee is a holomictic and eutrophic lake with depletion of oxygen in summer time.

J	AMIN, OM				AMIN, OM			2 LARVAL TREMATODES (STRIGEOIDEA) OF FISHES IN SOUTHEASTERN WISCONSIN	PROCEEDINGS OF THE HELMINTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON												Metacercariae of Posthodiplostomum minimum (MacCallum, 1921) and metacercariae morphologically identical to Ornithodiplostomum ptychocheilus (Faust, 1917) were recovered from 12 and 11 fish species (mostly centrarchids) from Tichigan and Silver Lakes, respectively, in southeastern Wisconsin. The O. ptychocheilus larvae from centrarchids may represent a new subspecies. The prevalence of infection with both trematode larvae in bluegills, Lepomis macrochirus, increased with host size. No difference host sex and prevalence was observed in bluegills from Tichigan Lake, but a higher prevalence was noted in females from Silver Lake. The lowest prevalence of P. minimum infection in bluegills occurred in the summer in both lakes and of O. ptychocheilus in this host from Tichigan Lake.																			0018-0130						1982	49	2					207	213																WOS:A1982PF76800006

This study employs the Stefan and Ashton equations to simulate historical river ice thickness across the Northern Hemisphere from 1972 to 2022 and assesses the effects of winter mean temperature (WMT) and winter mean snow depth (WMSD) on maximum river ice thickness (MRIT). The results indicate that the Stefan equation has good fitting performance at most stations, achieving higher accuracy in simulating river ice thickness. Although the Ashton equation generally underestimates river ice thickness, it still demonstrates excellent performance in capturing variability in certain stations. Over time, MRIT has generally declined, with most stations showing annual variation rates between 0 and 0.004 m/yr, although localized rates can reach up to 0.032 m/yr. The WMT increases at an average rate of 0.05 degrees C per year, and a 1 degrees C rise in WMT corresponds to an average reduction of 0.03 m in MRIT, according to the analysis. River ice shows increased temperature sensitivity in warmer climates. Additionally, for every 0.1 m increase in WMSD, the MRIT can decrease by up to 0.34 m. Under conditions of low temperature and snow depth, the sensitivity of MRIT to changes in snow depth is significantly higher. These insights provide a foundation for predicting future river ice trends and offer key insights for sustainable water resource and ecosystem management in cryosphere regions.

J	Champagne, O; Leduc, M; Coulibaly, P; Arain, MA				Champagne, Olivier; Leduc, Martin; Coulibaly, Paulin; Arain, M. Altaf			Winter hydrometeorological extreme events modulated by large-scale atmospheric circulation in southern Ontario	EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS												Extreme events are widely studied across the world because of their major implications for many aspects of society and especially floods. These events are generally studied in terms of precipitation or temperature extreme indices that are often not adapted for regions affected by floods caused by snowmelt. The rain on snow index has been widely used, but it neglects rain-only events which are expected to be more frequent in the future. In this study, we identified a new winter compound index and assessed how large-scale atmospheric circulation controls the past and future evolution of these events in the Great Lakes region. The future evolution of this index was projected using temperature and precipitation from the Canadian Regional Climate Model large ensemble (CRCM5-LE). These climate data were used as input in Precipitation Runoff Modelling System (PRMS) hydrological model to simulate the future evolution of high flows in three watersheds in southern Ontario. We also used five recurrent large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns in north-eastern North America and identified how they control the past and future variability of the newly created index and high flows. The results show that daily precipitation higher than 10mm and temperature higher than 5 degrees C were necessary historical conditions to produce high flows in these three watersheds. In the historical period, the occurrences of these heavy rain and warm events as well as high flows were associated with two main patterns characterized by high Z(500) anomalies centred on eastern Great Lakes (HP regime) and the Atlantic Ocean (South regime). These hydrometeorological extreme events will still be associated with the same atmospheric patterns in the near future. The future evolution of the index will be modulated by the internal variability of the climate system, as higher Z(500) on the east coast will amplify the increase in the number of events, especially the warm events. The relationship between the extreme weather index and high flows will be modified in the future as the snowpack reduces and rain becomes the main component of high-flow generation. This study shows the value of the CRCM5-LE dataset in simulating hydrometeorological extreme events in eastern Canada and better understanding the uncertainties associated with internal variability of climate.

J	Baras, E; Nindaba, J				Baras, E; Nindaba, J			Diel dynamics of habitat use by riverine young-of-the-year Barbus barbus and Chondrostoma nasus (Cyprinidae)	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Diel dynamics of habitat use by larvae and juveniles of barbel (Barbus barbus) and nase (Chondrostoma nasus) were investigated in a lotic river (River Ourthe, Belgium), from July 1995 to January 1996. In July, larvae of both species consistently used calm, shallow inshore bays throughout the day. In August and early September, juveniles of both species moved into bays at dawn, reached maximum densities at mid-day, when the bay was the warmest compared to the stream, then left the bay and moved into neighbouring shallow riffles in the late afternoon. Small fish immigrated earlier into the bay and emigrated later than larger fish. By early autumn, most nase and barbel had left the bay but occasionally returned there at night. While overwintering, nase occupied shelters in bays all day and showed no diel movements whereas barbel overwintered elsewhere. Because juveniles of the two species, the omnivorous barbel and the herbivorous nase, showed almost identical diel dynamics of habitat use throughout the growth period, it is suggested that habitat structure and predation pressure, rather than food availability, are the driving forces behind these patterns.					; Baras, Etienne/K-1894-2016	Baras, Etienne/0000-0002-3541-6597; 													0003-9136					NOV	1999	146	4					431	448																WOS:000084130300004
J	Anda, A; Simon, S; Simon-Gáspár, B				Anda, Angela; Simon, Szabina; Simon-Gaspar, Brigitta			Impacts of wintertime meteorological variables on decomposition of Phragmites australis and Solidago canadensis in the Balaton System	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												A field experiment was carried out in plant litter decomposition at three sites of the Balaton System (Balaton - Kis Balaton wetland - Zala Mouth) differing in their environment type during winter 2019/2020. The largest freshwater shallow lake in Central Europe (Carpathian Basin) is the Balaton, with a surface area of about 600 km(2) and an average depth of 3.25 m. Right around the lake, a nutrient filtering system, the Kis-Balaton wetland, is functioning to avoid water deterioration and eutrophication. The aim of the study was to investigate crop-weather relations in two sample species, the widely distributed native P. australis and the allied S. canadensis incubated beneath the water using leaf-bag technique to characterise plant organ decomposition. Based on our results, the most consistent meteorological variable regarding decomposition process was global radiation (r = - 0.62* to - 0.91**; r: correlation coefficient; * and ** mean that correlations are significant at the 0.05 and 0.01 levels), in each treatment. In modelling the decomposition process, out of eight meteorological variables, only the daily mean air temperatures and humidity were excluded from regression equations. On dominatingly windy days, with the increase in water temperature of the Zala Mouth, the sensitivity of the decomposition of S. canadensis litter tended to decrease as compared to P. australis. The remaining litter masses were in a Kis-Balaton > Balaton > Zala order, contrasting the water temperature gradient that decreased from the Zala to the Kis-Balaton wetland under wind-dominated conditions. Considering all sampling places in three aquatic ecosystems, there was a 2.2 and a 2.7% daily mean detritus mass loss in P. australis and S. canadensis, respectively. We concluded that the invasive S. canadensis litter decomposed more quickly than those of native P. australis, irrespective to sampling site. Increase in winter water temperature significantly promoted the litter decomposition of both plant species. The originality of the study is that it quantifies the litter decomposition for an Eastern European wetland, during wintertime.

The lower part of the sequence is composed of laminated gypsum and interbedded laminated mudstones and marls; these contain palynomorphs and articulated fish skeletons, sometimes with otoliths in situ. The lithofacies of the sediments indicate that deposition occurred in a meromictic brackish/saline lake environment that evolved into a gypsum marsh. The composition of the palynoflora indicates a probable middle Miocene age and a landscape characterized by prairies of Poaceae and groves of Pinus that had to endure stressful dry seasons. Two new species of fossil fish are described: Paralebias con quensis n. sp. and Valencia arcasensis n. sp., which belong to the families Poeciliidae and Valenciidae respectively. Paralebias con quensis falls into the subfamily Procatopinae, which includes tropical east African species still living in Tanzania, Kenya and Madagascar. Valencia arcasensis belongs to the Valenciidae, the Recent species of which are currently known from south-eastern Spain and western Greece. These fossil fishes bear testimony to a feebly brackish, more or less swampy environment.

Excellent correlation between the two methods was obtained (R-2 > 0.99). ELISA was a reliable and simple method with high reproducibility (coefficient of variation < 25%) and satisfactory recovery for the monitoring of low levels of MC-LR. MC-LR concentrations in Huangpu River varied with the seasonal variation, which peaked in August with the temperature over 30 degrees C and then gradually declined with the decreasing temperature after August. The highest MC-LR concentration in the Huangpu River was below the WHO drinking water quality standard (1 mu g/L). These results indicated that warm temperature accelerated the MC-LR synthesis and release, and it is necessary to regularly monitor the MC-LR levels, especially during the high algae period in summer. ELISA can be applied to detect the low levels of MC-LR in the field without complex treatment, avoiding the samples from denaturation and degradation during the transportation. Hence, ELISA is a better alternative of HPLC when HPLC is unavailable, especially when rapid testing is required in routine MC-LR analysis.					yu, xinyue/KCY-8249-2024; Li, Yuanting/ABC-4626-2020; WU, LIANG/M-9263-2014; Ye, Jing/ABD-3283-2021	Ye, Jing/0000-0002-0591-6566; Li, Yuanting/0000-0002-7890-9797; Wu, Liang/0000-0002-2139-9378													0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2022	29	37					56876	56884		10.1007/s11356-022-19791-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19791-x		MAR 2022						35347625					WOS:000773865900001

The Gaussian shape of the deep slope indicates the migration of radiocesium into the depths of the sediments, and this process is significantly enhanced in some places due to bioturbation caused by tench preparing for hibernation. The exponential shape of the deep slope is typical for sediments in which in winter, in the presence of an ice cover on the lake, thermodynamic mixing occurs in the surface layer caused by the effects of pore water buoyancy. In these sediments, radiocesium dissolved in the pore fluid migrates upwards into the near-bottom water, becoming a source of secondary pollution of the water column. In winter, the presence of such a process is easily determined by the emergence of a layered structure of the water column in the lake and the temperatures of the near-bottom waters exceeding 4 degrees C. In this case, each layer is characterized by constant standard water parameters (temperature, conductivity, concentrations of oxygen, and trace elements). Complex forms of the deep slope of the vertical profile of radiocesium activity concentrations, combining elements of the exponential and Gaussian forms, indicate the episodic presence of both migration mechanisms. A method is proposed for identifying sediments that are a source of secondary pollution of lake waters by estimating the differences between the normalized logarithms of the radiocesium activity concentrations of the deep slopes (below the maximum concentrations) of its vertical profiles in the sediments of the studied samples and the sample of the carbonate barrier sediments, which were discovered in the shallow part of Lake Juodis in 2003.

Biomass and production estimates were based on abundance of 34 species and on length-weight-relationships established on the populations under study. Standing crop of planktonic communities reached their maximum in early summer and were about twice as high among macrophytes than in adjacent open littoral water, whereas standing crop of benthic communities peaked durng senescence of aquatic plants in August and September. Total crustacean production was 12.6 g DW/m2 in the first and 8.4 g DW/m2 in the second year with relative contributions of benthic species of 39% and 54%. Microcrustaceans thus consumed 26% and 18% of total net primary production in the littoral zone. Seven species contributed each to more than 5% total production in both years: Acanthocyclops robustus, Daphnia hyalina/galeata, Bosmina longispina, Bosmina longirostris, Alona affinis and Chydorus gibbus.																			0003-9136					DEC	1991	123	2					165	185																WOS:A1991GW69000003

Using the Judas technique to locate and remove wintertime aggregations of invasive common carp	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Radio- and acoustic telemetry in three Midwestern lakes demonstrated that common carp, Cyprinus carpio L., aggregate as water temperatures descend below 10 degrees C. Particularly dense aggregations formed at temperatures <5 degrees C, and once located, these aggregations could be removed with an efficiency of up to 94% using seine nets. Carp aggregated just below the surface of the ice (approximately 1.5 m) and rarely descended to warmer waters, which extended down to 10 m. Although aggregations consistently formed close to shore, their locations could not be explained by temperature or dissolved oxygen. The aggregations also moved frequently, making radio-tagged fish invaluable to locate them. Coldwater aggregations of carp may reflect a type of shoaling behaviour and can be exploited with the aid of radio-tagged (Judas) fish to control this invasive fish effectively. Similar approaches might be developed for other gregarious invasive fishes.					; Chizinski, Christopher/G-6306-2011	Sorensen, Peter/0000-0003-0321-1279; Chizinski, Christopher/0000-0001-9294-2588; 													0969-997X	1365-2400				DEC	2011	18	6					497	505		10.1111/j.1365-2400.2011.00805.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2400.2011.00805.x													WOS:000297208100006

An Evaluation of Multiscalar Drought Indices in Nevada and Eastern California	EARTH INTERACTIONS												Nevada and eastern California are home to some of the driest and warmest climates, most mountainous regions, and fastest growing metro-politan areas of the United States. Throughout Nevada and eastern California, snow-dominated watersheds provide most of the water supply for both human and environmental demands. Increasing demands on finite water supplies have resulted in the need to better monitor drought and its associated hydrologic and agricultural impacts. Two multiscalar drought indices, the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), are evaluated over Nevada and eastern California regions of the Great Basin using standardized streamflow, lake, and reservoir water surface stages to quantify wet and dry periods. Results show that both metrics are significantly correlated to surface water availability, with SPEI showing slightly higher correlations over SPI, suggesting that the inclusion of a simple term for atmospheric demand in SPEI is useful for characterizing hydrologic drought in arid regions. These results also highlight the utility of multiscalar drought indices as a proxy for summer groundwater discharge and baseflow periods.

At one site in Lake St. Clair, near the source of the Detroit River, Northern Madtoms were observed to be guarding egg clutches. Total lengths of mature male and female madtoms were measured from video using computer image analysis. Clutch size, egg diameter, and juvenile length also were determined using computer image analysis. This is the first known reproducing population of the Northern Madtom in Canada.																			0008-3550					APR-JUN	1998	112	2					245	249																WOS:000075085600010

Following injection, the virus replicated in rainbow trout and chinook salmon O. tshawytscha, but not in coho salmon O. kisutch or brown trout Salmo trutta. The virus was also transmitted to steelhead and rainbow trout by waterborne exposures. In laboratory experiments, SHV induced only minor histopathologic changes in rainbow trout liver; the most prominent being hepatocyte syncytia which contain Feulgen positive, eosinophilic Cowdry Type A inclusions.																			0177-5103	1616-1580				SEP 29	1989	7	1					23	30		10.3354/dao007023	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/dao007023													WOS:A1989AV12100004

However, the lack of initial value dating hinders its application for dating terrestrial sediments. A large scatter of 129I/127I in prenuclear terrestrial samples has been reported; however, the key influencing factors remain unclear. This study presented iodine isotope data from three Argentine Entisol profiles and developed an iodine-source model to determine the influence of the source on iodine isotopic composition. The temporal patterns demonstrated clear climate modulations in natural terrestrial iodine isotopes over the last similar to 15 Kyr. The model identified rock weathering as a major source of iodine in continental sediments. Higher 129I/127I ratios at mid-high latitudes arise from weak geomagnetic shielding of cosmic rays and thus a high production rate, implying limited meridional diffusion of atmospheric iodine. These findings reveal that environmental factors are significant for constraining the initial value of terrestrial 129I. In terrestrial sediments, the absence of a specific initial value poses a challenge for 129I dating. Through examination of three profiles of Argentine Entisols, this study investigated how changes in the environment over the past 15 Kyr affected iodine isotopic composition. The climate modulations of iodine isotopes were indicated by comparing them with climatic proxies. A simple multi-source model of iodine suggested that "old" iodine from catchment rock weathering was a major iodine provider, and decreased 129I/127I with the enhanced South American Summer Monsoon and South Westerly Wind indicated a low-129I iodine input. The deviant 129I/127I of the most southern site was hypothesized to be caused by a greater cosmogenic 129I production rate at high latitudes than at mid-low latitudes. Natural 129I/127I was for the first time found to co-vary with the summer monsoon and westerlies in South America Rock weathering contributes more iodine to terrestrial sediments than oceanic emissions High 129I/127I values at mid-high latitudes imply low geomagnetic shielding and limited meridional diffusion of atmospheric iodine					liu, qi/B-5325-2008; Lan, Jianghu/AAJ-2140-2021; Liu, Xingxing/ABF-9303-2021; Zhou, Weijian/T-1412-2019; Fan, Yukun/I-8611-2014; Hou, Xiaolin/A-1585-2008; Liu, Qi/B-5325-2008; CHENG, PENG/HNP-4206-2023	liu, qi/0000-0002-3835-8361; Fan, Yukun/0000-0003-0074-7190; Lan, Jianghu/0000-0002-5618-2363; Hou, Xiaolin/0000-0002-4851-4858; Liu, Xingxing/0000-0001-6764-022X; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				FEB 28	2024	51	4							e2023GL107811	10.1029/2023GL107811	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023GL107811													WOS:001162573200001
J	Safronov, AN				Safronov, Alexander N.			Effects of Climatic Warming and Wildfires on Recent Vegetation Changes in the Lake Baikal Basin	CLIMATE												The vegetation changes in the area of the Russian part of the Lake Baikal water basin for the period 2010-2018 were investigated using MCD12C1 land cover. The decline in swamp systems area began in 2012 and continued until 2015, after which it partially recovered during the heavy rain season in 2018. During the period of 2010-2018, the area covered by forests did not exceed 20.3% of the Baikal basin of the total portion of the Baikal basin under study. Deforestation began in 2013 and continued until 2017. Over 2013-2018, the forest level decreased by 12.1% compared to the forest state in 2013. The analysis of summer rainfalls and aridity indexes was performed by using CRU TS and GPCC climatic datasets. It is shown that the interannual variations of precipitation and aridity changes are determined by the variability of the global circulation of moist air masses. The MCD64A1 (burned area) and MCD14ML (active fires) MODIS products were used for investigation of the influence of wildfires on vegetation changes. The spatial hotspot distributions and burned areas in general correspond to aridity zones, but they cannot explain the 20-fold increase in the number of wildfires. Most of the hotspot locations are away from settlements, roads, and loggings, in difficult-to-access mountainous areas, as well as in the low-inhabited areas of Siberia. We assume that the nature of such ignitions includes dry thunderstorms, pyrocumulus lightning, or remote impact.

Distribution and biophysical processes of beaded streams in Arctic permafrost landscapes	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Beaded streams are widespread in permafrost regions and are considered a common thermokarst landform. However, little is known about their distribution, how and under what conditions they form, and how their intriguing morphology translates to ecosystem functions and habitat. Here we report on a circum-Arctic survey of beaded streams and a watershed-scale analysis in northern Alaska using remote sensing and field studies. We mapped over 400 channel networks with beaded morphology throughout the continuous permafrost zone of northern Alaska, Canada, and Russia and found the highest abundance associated with medium to high ground-ice content permafrost in moderately sloping terrain. In one Arctic coastal plain watershed, beaded streams accounted for half of the drainage density, occurring primarily as low-order channels initiating from lakes and drained lake basins. Beaded streams predictably transition to alluvial channels with increasing drainage area and decreasing channel slope, although this transition is modified by local controls on water and sediment delivery. The comparisons of one beaded channel using repeat photography between 1948 and 2013 indicate a relatively stable landform, and C-14 dating of basal sediments suggest channel formation may be as early as the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. Contemporary processes, such as deep snow accumulation in riparian zones, effectively insulate channel ice and allows for perennial liquid water below most beaded stream pools. Because of this, mean annual temperatures in pool beds are greater than 2 degrees C, leading to the development of perennial thaw bulbs or taliks underlying these thermokarst features that range from 0.7 to 1.6 m. In the summer, some pools thermally stratify, which reduces permafrost thaw and maintains cold-water habitats. Snowmelt-generated peak flows decrease rapidly by two or more orders of magnitude to summer low flows with slow reach-scale velocity distributions ranging from 0.01 to 0.1ms(-1), yet channel runs still move water rapidly between pools. The repeating spatial pattern associated with beaded stream morphology and hydrological dynamics may provide abundant and optimal foraging habitat for fish. Beaded streams may create important ecosystem functions and habitat in many permafrost landscapes and their distribution and dynamics are only beginning to be recognized in Arctic research.					; Grosse, Guido/F-5018-2011	Heim, Kurt/0000-0002-6257-8284; Gaglioti, Benjamin/0000-0003-0591-5253; Grosse, Guido/0000-0001-5895-2141; Jones, Benjamin/0000-0002-1517-4711													1726-4170	1726-4189					2015	12	1					29	47		10.5194/bg-12-29-2015	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-12-29-2015													WOS:000347960800003

Model, proxy and isotopic perspectives on the East African Humid Period	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Both North and East Africa experienced more humid conditions during the early and mid-Holocene epoch (11,000-5000 yr BP: 11-5 ka) relative to today. The North African Humid Period has been a major focus of paleoclimatic study, and represents a response of the hydrological cycle to the increase in boreal summer insolation and associated ocean, atmosphere and land surface feedbacks. Meanwhile, the mechanisms that caused the coeval East African Humid Period are poorly understood. Here, we use results from isotope-enabled coupled climate modeling experiments to investigate the cause of the East African Humid Period. The modeling results are interpreted alongside proxy records of both water balance and the isotopic composition of rainfall. Our simulations show that the orbitally-induced increase in dry season precipitation and the subsequent reduction in precipitation seasonality can explain the East African Humid Period, and this scenario agrees well with regional lake level and pollen paleoclimate data. Changes in zonal moisture flux from both the Atlantic and Indian Ocean account for the simulated increase in precipitation from June through November. Isotopic paleoclimate data and simulated changes in moisture source demonstrate that the western East African Rift Valley in particular experienced more humid conditions due to the influx of Atlantic moisture and enhanced convergence along the Congo Air Boundary. Our study demonstrates that zonal changes in moisture advection are an important determinant of climate variability in the East African region. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Hubble, DS; Harper, DM				Hubble, DS; Harper, DM			Phytoplankton community structure and succession in the water column of Lake Naivasha, Kenya: a shallow tropical lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lake Naivasha is a shallow freshwater lake in the Rift Valley of Kenya. Since the 1980s, when the lake showed a seasonal shift between diatom and cyanobacterial dominance it has become moderately eutrophic. Its algal assemblage is now dominated by a persistent Aulacoseira italica population both numerically and in terms of contribution to overall primary production. Algal and cyanobacterial counts were used to derive Simpson's diversity, succession rate and total community succession, focusing on the 10 most numerically abundant taxa. 170 species were identified, 43 of which were in common with the 143 found in 1979 - 80, before the increase in trophic state. Most diatoms are indicators of moderate to high nutrient conditions. There is little horizontal or vertical variation in successional processes throughout the lake and although the absolute abundance of cells varies widely, proportional composition is relatively stable. In Crescent Island lagoon, the only regularly stratified site, hypolimnetic succession rates are lower than those in the epilimnion. Overall, community composition is controlled by mixing ( and hence light regime) and nutrient availability. With ' endless summer' conditions and full mixing, there is a successional pattern of ' muted seasonality' adapted to physical instability and environmental stability.																			0018-8158					NOV	2002	488	1-3					89	98		10.1023/A:1023314128188	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1023314128188													WOS:000182300700008

To explore the occurrence mechanism and evolution patterns of this drought-converted flood better, a full lifecycle model is developed in this article. Employing Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, with the advantages of high spatial-temporal resolution and all-day and all-weather working capacity, a bimodal threshold was applied to efficiently extract flood inundation mapping. Thus, 61 Sentinel-1 SAR images in 2020 were used to establish inundation sequences for full lifecycle monitoring. This flood presented an abrupt transformation from drought, a long duration, and the slow receding of water, and its area exceeded 3000 km(2) from July to early October. In addition, inundation models that reflect the lake area and water level relationship were introduced to assist near-real-time monitoring. Through hydrological and meteorological analysis, compared with results of previous years (from 2010 to 2019), this study found that the water level from July to October in 2020 was at least 17% higher than the mean level at the same period in history and water volume had increased about 44.13 billion m(3) during the flooding period. Similarly, the average precipitation from June to September was significantly higher than the same period of previous years. It was the abnormal sustained heavy precipitation and sharp rising of the water level that caused this catastrophic flood. In particular, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) increased from -1.02 in April to 1.31 in July, indicating that the flood was abruptly converted from drought. The inundated areas of several land types during different periods of the full lifecycle were calculated for damage assessment. It was found that cropland was the most heavily impaired with a maximum inundated area of 1375.67 km(2), while other land types including forest, grassland, wetland, and impervious surface were relatively less damaged. The study results demonstrate that flood full lifecycle monitoring based on SAR data is helpful to explore the patterns of flood evolution, analyze causes, and assess damage. Simultaneously, focusing on drought-converted floods contributes to the understanding of flood patterns, which provides relevant management departments with decision support for disaster prevention and mitigation.

The upstream migration started in early May with medium or falling water levels and water temperatures of 6-10.degree. C, and lasted until late May or early June. Roach (both males and females) migrating early in the season were larger than roach migrating late in the season. Males matured on average one year younger than females. The first males were mature at age 2 years, the first females were matue at age 3 years. Males were smaller than females in all age groups. There was no significant year to year variation in mean length of male and female roach in the various age-groups. Mean population fecundity during 1980-1982 was estimated to be 19 .times. 106 eggs or 63,300 eggs m-2 of spawning area. The survival rate of eggs and small roach varied considerably due to rapid and unpredictable changes in water and silt levels.

Nest Success of Snowy Plovers (Charadrius nivosus) in the Southern High Plains of Texas	WATERBIRDS												Snowy Plovers (Charadrius nivosus) nesting on edges of saline lakes within the Southern High Plains (SHP) of Texas are threatened by habitat degradation due to reduced artesian spring flow, making many saline lakes unsuitable for nesting and migrating shorebirds. Factors influencing nest success were evaluated, current nest success estimates in the SHP of Texas were compared to estimates obtained ten years prior, and causes and timing of nest failures determined. Overall, 215 nests were monitored from three saline lakes in 2008 -2009, with nest success estimates from Program MARK ranging from 7-33% ((x) over bar = 22%). The leading causes of nest failures were attributed to predation (40%) and weather (36%). Nest success was negatively influenced by number of plants within 707-cm(2) plot, positively influenced by percent surface water availability, and at one saline lake, negatively influenced by day during the nesting season (i.e., nest success declined later in the nesting season). When compared to estimates ten years prior (1998-1999), mean nest success has declined by 31%. If nesting Snowy Plovers continue to experience increased predation rates, decreased hydrological integrity, and habitat alterations, populations will continue to decline throughout this region.

Opposite, tropical lakes lack equivalent studies, particularly those considering long-term monitoring. The aim of the present study is to uncover patterns in the temporal and vertical variation of the phytoplankton biomass in Lake Alchichica, Puebla, through considering twelve years (1999-2010) of vertical chlorophyll a profiles recorded on a monthly basis with a PNF-300 natural fluorescence profiler (Biospherical). We recognize a clear seasonal pattern in the chlorophyll a concentration with three maxima: a) during the winter circulation period throughout the water column, b) at the onset of the stratification, accumulated close to the surface, and c) along the well-established stratification, located at the metalimnetic deep chlorophyll maximum. This pattern is clearly related with the thermal behavior of the lake corresponding to warm-monomixis. It was observed a positive correlation with the mixed layer and a negative correlation with the euphotic zone. A time-series analysis ratified the annual cycle, however it did not identify interannual patterns or long-term trends; this is, Alchichica is regular and predictable year after year, with no relevant interannual differences along the studied period.					; Alcocer, Javier/S-7672-2019; Oseguera, Luis/AAV-2739-2021	Alcocer, Javier/0000-0002-0535-7936; 													0188-8897					SEP-DEC	2015	25	3					347	356																WOS:000387069600003

ECOSYSTEM SERVICES												Natural and artificial lakes provide multiple cultural ecosystem services (CES), but they are largely underrepresented in CES assessments, which mostly focus on individual large lakes. Social media data may offer an opportunity to analyse CES of lakes at regional scales. This study therefore aims at exploring the use of photos uploaded to the photo-sharing platform Flickr for analysing CES of 2,807 lakes in the European Alps. We (1) explained the spatial distribution of photo-user-days (PUD), (2) examined the importance of lakes in providing CES, and (3) identified key CES through text analysis of user-generated tags. Our results indicate that good physical accessibility and proximity to densely populated areas mostly increase PUD density, although temporal accessibility is limited to a few summer months for mountain lakes. Based on 418 unique tags, we identified 12 different CES, including aesthetic experiences and recreation. Less prominent CES included sense of place or 'culture & heritage'. Our findings suggest that lakes are important for providing multiple CES, but future research should include user survey data to deepen the understanding of people's perceptions and preferences.					; Schirpke, Uta/AAF-5256-2020; Tasser, Erich/AAS-8608-2020; Tappeiner, Ulrike/JAZ-0929-2023	Tasser, Erich/0000-0002-9179-7494; Ebner, Manuel/0000-0002-9303-575X; 													2212-0416					OCT	2021	51								101354	10.1016/j.ecoser.2021.101354	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2021.101354		AUG 2021											WOS:000703785400005

Carnivory and active hunting by the planktonic testate amoeba Difflugia tuberspinifera	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Difflugia tuberspinifera, a testate amoeba found in the open water plankton of Liuxi He and other south Chinese reservoirs during summer, is one of six or more species that occasionally live a pelagic life. Here, we suggest that its incentive to leave the bottom might be the abundance of food in the water column rather than temperature. This Difflugia (and perhaps the other pelagic species as well) is indeed an actively hunting carnivore that catches small rotifers and other prey in the same size range. In Liuxi He, it readily feeds on Collotheca cf. mutabilis, which it catches and consumes with remarkable agility: it first inspects the jelly tube that protects the prey, then moves to the bottom of it, perforates the jelly near the prey's foot, and finally ingests the rotifer foot-first.

John; MacIntyre, Sally			Vertical and temporal distribution of two copepod species, Cyclops scutfier and Diaptomus pribilofensis, in 24 h arctic daylight	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Factors structuring zooplankton communities in areas with 24 h of sunlight are not well understood. In stratified temperate lakes with fish, zooplankton generally undergo a diel vertical migration (DVM) to avoid predation. Zooplankton abundance may also be linked to the quality and quantity of food. To explore factors that determine vertical structure of zooplankton where DVM does not occur, we obtained time-series data on the vertical distribution of the two dominate copepods, Cyclops scutifier and Diaptomus pribilofensis, in Toolik Lake, Alaska, a site within the Arctic Long Term Ecological Research area. These two species compose similar to 80-90% of pelagic mesozooplankton community density. Temperature plays a large role in the vertical distribution of these two species. During the summers of 2002 and 2003, C. scutifer underwent a seasonal vertical migration from the epilimnion to the hypolimnion as water temperatures increased. Diaptomus pribilofensis exhibited a strong preference for warmer water and were not present in the water column until epilimnetic temperatures reached similar to 9'C. During both years of this study, C. scutifer and D. pribilofensis segregated vertically in the water column along thermal gradients when the two species overlapped temporally.																			0142-7873					MAR	2007	29	3					275	289		10.1093/plankt/fbm014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbm014													WOS:000246370500005

We report on the evolution of the giant cloud system covering its north pole using observations acquired by the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft. A radiative transfer model in spherical geometry shows that the clouds are found at an altitude between 30 and 65 km. We also show that the polar cloud system vanished progressively as Titan approached equinox in August 2009, revealing at optical wavelengths the underlying sea known as Kraken Mare. This decrease of activity suggests that the north-polar downwelling has begun to shut off. Such a scenario is compared with the Titan global circulation model of Rannou et al. (2006), which predicts a decrease of cloud coverage in northern latitudes at the same period of time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The long term wave induced bending moment predicted using traditional three-dimensional rigid body hydrodynamic methods is augmented due to the effects of springing and whipping by including allowances based on two-dimensional hydroelasticity predictions across a range of headings and sea states. The analysis results are correlated with full scale measurements that are available for this ship. By combining the long term "rigid body" wave-bending moment with the effects of hydroelasticity, a suitable service factor is derived for a Great Lakes Bulk Carrier traveling from the Canadian Great Lakes to China via the Suez Canal.

Nesting substrate and water-level fluctuations influence wading bird nesting patterns in a large shallow eutrophic lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Water-level fluctuations determine the ecological function of shallow lakes and wetlands. Wading birds (Pelecaniformes and Ciconiiformes) are reliable indicators of the biotic conditions at multiple trophic levels, thereby reflecting an ecosystem response to water-level changes. We used a historic nesting record dating back to 1977 and an information-theoretic approach to identify environmental factors that were most important for predicting the number of wading bird nests at Lake Okeechobee, a highly managed reservoir in Florida. The three top models accounted for 71% of the Akaike weight. Model variables included area of willow (Salix spp.) for nesting substrate, maximum depth of the lake on January 1, and foraging habitat availability over the nesting season. Collectively, the results suggest that the number of nests was greatest when area of nesting substrate was high and water levels were moderate (3.9-4.4 m). Nesting substrate was greatest when water levels fell below 3.9 m at least once every three years. Nest numbers dropped when either nesting substrate or foraging habitat was limited. This study identifies key hydrological parameters that support large populations of breeding wading birds and thus promote healthy, functioning wetland ecosystems.

Cryolithological, ground ice and fossil bioindicator (pollen, diatoms, plant macrofossils, rhizopods, insects, mammal bones) records from Bol'shoy Lyakhovsky Island permafrost sequences (73 degrees 20'N, 141 degrees 30'E) document the environmental history in the region for the past c. 115 kyr. Vegetation similar to modern subarctic tundra communities prevailed during the Eemian/Early Weichselian transition with a climate warmer than the present. Sparse tundra-like vegetation and harsher climate conditions were predominant during the Early Weichselian. The Middle Weichselian deposits contain peat and peaty soil horizons with bioindicators documenting climate amelioration. Although dwarf willows grew in more protected places, tundra and steppe vegetation prevailed. Climate conditions became colder and drier c. 30 kyr BP. No sediments dated between c. 28.5 and 12.05 C-14 kyr BP were found, which may reflect active erosion during that time. Herb and shrubby vegetation were predominant 11.6-11.3 C-14 kyr BP. Summer temperatures were c. 4 degrees C higher than today. Typical arctic environments prevailed around 10.5 C-14 kyr BP. Shrub alder and dwarf birch tundra were predominant between c. 9 and 7.6 kyr BP. Reconstructed summer temperatures were at least 4 degrees C higher than present. However, insect remains reflect that steppe-like habitats existed until c. 8 kyr BP. After 7.6 kyr BP, shrubs gradually disappeared and the vegetation cover became similar to that of modern tundra. Pollen and beetles indicate a severe arctic environment c. 3.7 kyr BP. However, Betula nana, absent on the island today, was still present. Together with our previous study on Bol'shoy Lyakhovsky Island covering the period between about 200 and 115 kyr, a comprehensive terrestrial palaeoenvironmental data set from this area in western Beringia is now available for the past two glacial-interglacial cycles.					; Kuznetsova, Tatyana/J-4806-2013; Kuznetsova, Tatiana/B-2755-2016; Andreev, Andrei/J-2701-2015; Novenko, Elena/L-7934-2015; Kuzmina, Svetlana/AAN-7520-2021; Schirrmeister, Lutz/O-5584-2015; Grosse, Guido/F-5018-2011; Meyer, Hanno/E-2870-2016; Tarasov, Pavel/ABG-3993-2020; Kunitsky, Viktor/AAC-9423-2019	Novenko, Elena/0000-0003-2174-8467; Kuznetsova, Tatyana/0000-0003-4302-9607; /0000-0002-7219-5009; Andreev, Andrei/0000-0002-8745-9636; Schirrmeister, Lutz/0000-0001-9455-0596; Grosse, Guido/0000-0001-5895-2141; Kunitsky, Viktor/0000-0002-1146-3890													0300-9483	1502-3885					2009	38	1					72	110		10.1111/j.1502-3885.2008.00039.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1502-3885.2008.00039.x													WOS:000262635900006

Special attention is given to the models that take into account the influence of toxicants on the ecosystem components. A model of ecosystem disturbances is described that may be used to forecast the ecosystem behaviour during various management conditions in the lake region. It is based on experimental data and the method of its informational provision is given. Model experiments showed that the lake ecosystem is more sensitive to chronic input of toxicants in low concentrations than to fluxes of their input resulting in a concentration of up to 1 mg l(-1). During ice-cover period the planktonic community is shown to be less resistant to disturbances than in summer.

Diversity of the sooty blotch and flyspeck complex on apple in Germany	MYCOLOGICAL PROGRESS												Sooty blotch and flyspeck (SBFS) is a complex of more than 80 fungal species in 24 genera, mostly belonging to the order Capnodiales within the Dothideomycetes. Colonies of these epiphytes become visible on the surface of apples in mid-to late summer. Several species of SBFS fungi have been previously identified from apples in Germany, but little is known about species diversity, prevalence patterns, or relationship to orchard management practices. To address these questions, apple orchards were surveyed during the 2008 to 2011 seasons in the two largest German apple-growing regions along the Lower Elbe river (northern Germany) and Lake Constance (southern Germany). Using a combination of approaches based on morphology and ITS sequence data, 19 known or putative SBFS species were found, of which 10 belonged to Capnodiales. Abandoned orchards harboured a higher species diversity than organically managed orchards, and no SBFS disease was seen in orchards under integrated pest management. Peltaster cerophilus was the most common SBFS fungus, being associated with 96 and 84 % of SBFS-affected apples sampled from northern and southern German organic orchards, respectively. Microcyclosporella mali and Cyphellophora sessilis were the next most commonly found SBFS species in northern and southern Germany, respectively. Schizothyrium pomi was the only cause of the flyspeck mycelial type of SBFS disease in Germany.																			1617-416X	1861-8952				JAN	2016	15	1							2	10.1007/s11557-015-1145-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11557-015-1145-9													WOS:000367301200002

The average abundance of A. granulata reached 134.14 x 10(3) cells dm(-3) (10.66 x 10(3) filaments dm(-3)), contributing 9.1% to the total phytoplankton. Compared with freshwater areas, A. granulata abundance in the Pearl River Estuary was one or more orders lower. Among the four variant forms of A. granulata, the dominance sequence was A. granulata var. granulata > var. angustissima > var. curvata > var. angustissima f. spiralis. The dominance of A. granulata var. granulata and A.g. var. angustissima benefited from their linear shape. A. granulata abundance was higher in the warm seasons and lower in the cold seasons. The fluctuations of Si concentrations could also influence contrasting results as in May 2008 and May 2009. The spatial distribution of A. granulata was mainly influenced by the water runoff of the Pearl River at different outflow channel. We found that the relative abundance of var. angustissima to A. granulata var. granulata was much higher in winter than in other seasons, which maybe because high cell surface/volume area (A/V) benefited var. angustissima by ensuring more effective uptake of nutrients and CO2 and a slower sinking velocity than var. granulata.

Historic model years 2003-2012 provided a framework to evaluate the sensitivity of reservoir thermal processes to future synthetic climate scenarios over a 100-year period. Average epilimnion and hypolimnion temperatures increased by approximately 12 and 7%, respectively, after 100 years of increasing air temperatures. Stratification duration increased by one to two weeks, beginning earlier and ending later than the historical stratification period. Additionally, the average number of days with ice cover decreased 18-57% by the end of all scenarios. Results provide insight into the sensitivity of Wachusett Reservoir water temperatures and the potential impacts of increasing air temperatures resulting from climate change.

J	POWER, G; BARTON, DR				POWER, G; BARTON, DR			SOME EFFECTS OF PHYSIOGRAPHIC AND BIOTIC FACTORS ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF ANADROMOUS ARCTIC CHAR (SALVELINUS-ALPINUS) IN UNGAVA BAY, CANADA	ARCTIC												Interviews with Inuit hunters and measurements of topographic maps were used to characterize 70 rivers discharging into Ungava Bay in northern Quebec in terms of their ability to sustain runs of anadromous arctic char. Field crews visited 29 of these to verify conclusions and add detail. Anadromous arctic char streams tend to differ from non-char streams in size, gradient and distance to overwintering lakes, but there are no clear distinctions. Shallow boulder-strewn areas with maze-like braided channels were the most common cause of lack of char or problems with fish passage. Inuit hunters reported that low flows in autumn, and associated mortalities among migrating fish, have become increasingly common in recent years. We attribute this, at least in part, to changes in climate and the effect of abundant caribou on vegetation. Both destabilize flow regimes and increase the prevalence and severity of problems for fish migrating upstream. There is considerable opportunity for stream management to ease fish passage and increase production of anadromous arctic char. This is fortunate because the rapidly growing Inuit population is increasing the demand for subsistence harvests, expansion of the sports fishery and initiation of commercial fishing.																			0004-0843	1923-1245				SEP	1987	40	3					198	203																WOS:A1987K388300005

In this study, two novel Chlorella strains (ABC-002, ABC-008) were isolated from a freshwater lake in South Korea during the winter season and examined for possible use in the biofuel production process. The comparison of ABC-002 and ABC-008 strains with Chlorella vulgaris UTEX265 under two different temperatures (10 degrees C, 25 degrees C) revealed their cold-tolerant phenotypes as well as high biomass yields. The maximum quantum yields of UTEX25, ABC-002, and ABC-008 at 10 degrees C were 0.5594, 0.6747, and 0.7150, respectively, providing evidence of the relatively higher cold-resistance capabilities of these two strains. Furthermore, both the biomass yields and lipid content of the two novel strains were found to be higher than those of UTEX265; the overall lipid productivities of ABC-002 and ABC-008 were 1.7 similar to 2.8 fold and 1.6 similar to 4.2 fold higher compared to that of UTEX265, respectively. Thus, the high biomass and lipid productivity over a wide range of temperatures indicate that C. vulgaris ABC-002 and ABC-008 are promising candidates for applications in biofuel productions via outdoor biomass cultivation.					; Lee, BongSoo/AAP-3262-2020; KOH, HYUNGI/AAJ-5120-2021; Kang, Nam/AAW-1788-2021	Park, Won-kun/0000-0002-0882-3103; Kang, Nam Kyu/0000-0003-0223-4882; Koh, Hyun Gi/0000-0002-1348-1312													1017-7825	1738-8872				JUN	2019	29	6					952	961		10.4014/jmb.1904.04008	http://dx.doi.org/10.4014/jmb.1904.04008								31154744					WOS:000473260900013

However, its application has not been widely extended to the research on speleothems. In this study, we measure the Sr abundance and the Sr/Ca ratios of three stalagmites (two aragonite stalagmites, one calcite stalagmite) using the state-of-the-art fourth-generation Avaatech high-resolution XRF core scanner. Through comparisons among different scan paths and among different scan resolutions, as well as comparisons with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES), Itrax XRF, and Artax XRF results, we confirm that the Avaatech XRF core scanner could precisely, quickly, and non-destructively analyze the high-resolution Sr abundance of speleothems. Furthermore, we combine the stalagmite O-18 records to explore the paleoclimatic significance of the measured stalagmite Sr/Ca.

J	Kaufman, D				Kaufman, Darrell S.			An overview of late Holocene climate and environmental change inferred from Arctic lake sediment	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The 14 papers in this Special Issue of the Journal of Paleolimnology report new records of Holocene climate and environmental change from Arctic lakes, with emphasis on the last 2000 years. The study sites span the high latitudes of North America and extend into northwestern Europe. The studies rely on multiple proxy indicators to reconstruct past climate, including: varve thicknesses, chironomid, diatom, and pollen assemblages, biogenic-silica and organic-matter content, oxygen-isotope ratios in diatoms, and the frequency of lake-ice-rafted aggregates. These proxies primarily document changes in past summer temperatures, the main control on physical and biological processes in lakes at high latitudes. The records will be integrated into a larger network of paleoclimate sites to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of climate change and to compare the paleoclimate inferences with the output of general circulation models.

Five sampling stations, were chosen reflecting the contrasting environmental conditions prevailing in the Lagoon, (marine or freshwater influence). The samples (0.3 m(2) of sediment) were collected at three month intervals between May 1983 and May 1984 with a corer (20 cm in diameter), and sieved through a 0.5 mm mesh screen. We found 3757 organisms of three taxa: Polychaeta (22 families, 43 species), Mollusca (11 families, 17 species) and Crustacea (20 families, 27 species). The polychaetes dominated in each sample. Capitella ''capitata'' Mediomastus californiensis, Laeonereis culveri, Streblospio benedicti, Lembos sp, Lucina pectinata Palaemonetes vulgaris, Melinna maculata, Tellina lineata Xenanthura sp, Tellina alternata tayloriana and Parandalia vivianneae were the most abundant species, although not present at every station, presumably because of the contrasting environmental conditions. The highest abundances were registered at stations under marine influence, especially during the rainy and winter seasons. Diversity fluctuated at each station; the highest values were recorded in the southern (2.11 on average) and northeastern (2.06 on average) legions.

Evidence of estrogenic endocrine disruption in smallmouth and largemouth bass inhabiting Northeast US national wildlife refuge waters: A reconnaissance study	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Intersex as the manifestation of testicular oocytes (TO) in male gonochoristic fishes has been used as an indicator of estrogenic exposure. Here we evaluated largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) or small mouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) form 19 National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs) in the Northeast U.S. inhabiting waters on or near NWR lands for evidence of estrogenic endocrine disruption. Waterbodies sampled included rivers, lakes, impoundments, ponds, and reservoirs. Here we focus on evidence of endocrine disruption in male bass evidenced by gonad histopathology including intersex or abnormal plasma vitellogenin (Vtg) concentrations. During the fall seasons of 2008-2010, we collected male smallmouth bass (n=118) from 12 sites and largemouth bass (n=173) from 27 sites. Intersex in male smallmouth bass was observed at all sites and ranged from 60% to 100%; in male largemouth bass the range was 0-100%. Estrogenicity, as measured using a bioluminescent yeast reporter, was detected above the probable no effects concentration (0.73 ng/L) in ambient water samples from 79% of the NWR sites. Additionally, the presence of androgen receptor and glucocorticoid receptor ligands were noted as measured via novel nuclear receptor translocation assays. Mean plasma Vtg was elevated ( > 0.2 mg/ml) in male smallmouth bass at four sites and in male largemouth bass at one site. This is the first reconnaissance survey of this scope conducted on US National Wildlife Refuges. The baseline data collected here provide a necessary benchmark for future monitoring and justify more comprehensive NWR-specific studies.

Dissolved cation levels for Ca, Mg, Na, K, Mn, and Fe, both sestonic fractions and phytoplankton densities reached and sustained a maximum during April and May under a heavy cover of ice and snow, and a minimum during open-season from mid-June to mid-Oct. Rates of monthly water renewal varied greatly with a low of 0.28 turnovers in April and a high of 15.37 turnovers in June. Massive flushing in June and July reduced dissolved Fe levels to < 0.060 mg/l from a typical maxima > 8.0 mg/l in April and May. Tests for linear correlation between the various cations, sestonic fractions and phytoplankton showed in most cases positive and significant (P < 0.05) relationships. For most dissolved Fe and Mn pairings with phytoplankton and seston exceptionally significant (P .mchlt. 0.001) relationships were observed.																			0020-9309						1978	63	6					773	786																WOS:A1978GU13100003

The evolution of the hydroclimate during the PETM in East Asia, which currently is influenced by the Asian Monsoon and hosts similar to 20% of the world's population, is crucial to understand the future monsoon and climate changes. However, PETM records in Asia are relatively rare and it remains poorly understood how the hydroclimate responded to climate forcing under extreme atmosphere pCO2. Here we present stable carbon isotope records of bulk carbonate and total organic carbon (delta 13Ccarb and delta 13CTOC) from lacustrine deposits in the Jianghan Basin, Central China that both record the global carbon isotope excursion (CIE) that marks the PETM. The magnitude of both the CIEs in delta 13Ccarb and delta 13CTOC are larger than that presumed in the global exogenic carbon pool, as is common for terrestrial and marginal marine records. The particularly large amplitude (similar to 11.4 parts per thousand) and unique shape of CIE in delta 13Ccarb, which represents authigenic lacustrine carbonates and therefore lake dissolved inorganic carbon delta 13C values. Although our evidence against diagenesis is not fully conclusive, this signal implies the local addition of 13C-depleted carbon in excess of the global input. We consider increased transport rates of organic matter-derived carbon from the catchment to the lake the most likely source. Combined with the disappearance of evaporitic deposits during the PETM, we attribute this to an increase in precipitation and erosion, possibly linked to a northward extension of the Asian summer monsoon.

REVUE DU NORD												In 1256, during the campaign he was successfully leading against the western Frisians, William II, count of Holland and king of the Romans, galloped across a frozen lake; his horse fell through the ice and the chivalrous monarch was viciously put to death by a group of peasants. This episode, far beyond the obvious rash of propaganda that it caused in Holland, raised the interest of numerous western chroniclers, who seized this opportunity to brand a people whose habits were reputed as barbarous, to bemoan such a stroke of fate, and to mourn both the Empire's eclipse and the frailty inherent to the royal condition. For them, the event conjured up both a prelude to the Great Interregnum and a renewed form of memento mori.																			0035-2624					JUL-DEC	2011	93	391					833	+																WOS:000303266600017
J	Orville, RE; Huffines, GR				Orville, RE; Huffines, GR			Cloud-to-ground lightning in the United States: NLDN results in the first decade, 1989-98	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												The physical and geographical characteristics of over 216 million cloud-to-ground lightning flashes recorded during the first decade (1989-98) of operation of the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) covering the entire continental United States are presented. These characteristics include the total cloud-to-ground flash density, the positive flash density, the percentage of positive flashes, the first stroke negative and positive peak currents, and the multiplicity for negative and positive flashes. All analyses were done with a spatial resolution of 0.2 degrees corresponding to an approximate resolution of 20 km. Flash densities were not corrected for detection efficiency; the measured values are presented. The maximum measured flash density is found to exceed 9 flashes km(-2) across Florida in the Tampa-Orlando-Cape Canaveral corridor, near Fort Myers, and between Lake Okeechobee and the Atlantic Ocean. The mean monthly flash count peaks in July at approximately 5.5 million flashes. Positive flash density maxima, greater than 0.4 flashes km(-2) occur in southern Florida; Houston, Texas; and along the Texas-Louisiana border. A broad region of relatively high positive density also occurs throughout the Midwest. The mean monthly positive flash count peaks in June and July at approximately 240 000 flashes in each month. The annual mean percentage of lightning that lowered positive charge was highest in the upper Midwest, exceeding 10% or 20% throughout most of the region. High percentages are also characteristic along the West Coast. The annual percentage of positive lightning has increased from 3% in 1989 to approximately 9% in 1998. The authors believe the increase is the result of improved sensor detection capability in the past decade. The mean monthly percentage of positive lightning flashes ranged from 4% in August to 17% in December for the decade. The annual median negative peak current ranged from 30 kA in 1989, decreasing steadily to about 20 kA in 1998. The annual median positive peak current ranged from 55 kA in 1989 decreasing to about 22 kA in 1998. The annual median peak negative and positive currents have approximately the same value since 1995, the first year after the NLDN upgrade. The monthly median first stroke peak currents for the decade peak in the winter and reach a minimum in May (positive current) and July (negative current). The mean monthly negative multiplicity for the decade ranges from 2.1 in February to 2.5 from June to October. The mean monthly positive multiplicity is approximately 1.2 throughout the year. The diurnal variation of the maximum flash rate over land was examined and found to peak during 1200-2000 local time (LT) with an exception for the upper Midwest, which peaked during 2000-0400 LT. Over water surrounding the continental United States, the lightning flash rate peaks primarily in the morning hours from 0400 to 1200 LT.

J	Peltomaa, E; Ojala, A				Peltomaa, Elina; Ojala, Anne			Consequences for pelagic energy mobilisation of a sudden browning episode without a clear increase in DOC concentration: a case of a boreal pristine lake	AQUATIC SCIENCES												In the boreal zone, episodes of heavy rains are among the most conspicuous events disturbing aquatic ecosystems. Due to climate change they are predicted to become more frequent and intense, leading on browning of lakes. We assessed the possible effects of heavy rains to DOC concentration and water colour and resulting impacts on functioning of a headwater lake with naturally high water colour and concentration of allochthonous DOC. The weekly measurements were carried out in summers 2002-2004; the first 2 years had normal and the last year very high summer precipitation. The rains resulted in rapid increase in water colour, but not in DOC. We hypothesised that due to browning, irrespective of whether it stems from an increase in brownish DOC or other coloured substances, photosynthesis decreases, bacterial activity increases, and the lake becomes more heterotrophic. We also anticipated that due to strengthened heterotrophy, the period with apparent net autotrophy and CO2 flux onto the lake would disappear. To test our hypothesis, we measured autotrophic inorganic carbon uptake of photosynthetic organisms as well as dark fixation of inorganic carbon, community respiration and leucine uptake. Finally, we compared the results to CO2 flux measurements with an eddy covariance technique. Our hypotheses were only partly supported since there were no drastic changes in any of the metabolic processes measured. Although the lake ecosystem became slightly more heterotrophic, primary production was still occasionally higher than community respiration and the lake could act as a sink of CO2. Thus regarding metabolic processes, the ecosystem of this pristine lake was not strongly disturbed by the sudden browning episode.

J	KAUSS, PB; HAMDY, YS				KAUSS, PB; HAMDY, YS			POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS IN SURFICIAL SEDIMENTS AND CAGED MUSSELS OF THE ST-MARYS RIVER, 1985	HYDROBIOLOGIA												During 1985, a biological monitoring study was conducted in the St. Marys River to determine the availability and source areas of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the relative importance of water and sediment to tissue contaminant concentrations. Clean unionid mussels (Elliptio complanata) were exposed in cages for three weeks at 14 stations and surficial sediments were obtained at 12 of these. The highest concentrations of total PAHs as well as many individual compounds were found in sediments and mussels from the Algoma Steel Slip above St. Marys Falls and in sediments below the discharge of the Edison Sault Electric Co. Canal. Although concentrations were lower below the Falls, elevated levels persisted downstream along the Ontario shore into Lake George. PAHs were also accumulated by mussels exposed along the Michigan shoreline, but at lower levels than along the Ontario shore. From 23 to 63 percent of the PAHs in sediments and 6 to 27 percent of those in mussels were comprised of compounds with mutagenic and/or carcinogenic properties. The predominance of higher molecular weight PAHs in both sediments and mussels as well as lower molecular weight PAHs and nitrogen- and sulfur-containing PAHs in certain areas, indicates that high temperature combustion of fossil fuels is the major source of PAHs, augmented by localized spills of fossil fuels and coke oven by-products. Mussels contained fewer PAHs (up to 18 vs. 25) at lower concentrations (mu-g kg-1 vs. mg kg-1) than the associated surficial sediments. Also, mussels suspended at mid-depth in the water column accumulated similar concentrations to those exposed to sediments, indicating that the major exposure pathway is via the water filtered by these organisms, and hence, is due primarily to external industrial inputs.																			0018-8158					JUL 26	1991	219						37	62		10.1007/BF00024746	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00024746													WOS:A1991GK03100004

Here we considered the problem of assessing the impact of climate variability on successional events in a lake (Plusssee) of the temperate region between January and May. We first established a statistical link between large-scale air temperature, at about 1500 m height, and the local temperature, in order to bridge the spatial gap of information obtained from global climate models and local climate which forces processes in the lake. Secondly, the local temperatures were statistically related to biologically induced dynamic features in the lake, derived from Secchi depths readings (as integrated measures). The observed relationships were compared with results from a phyto-and zooplankton population-dynamic model run under different temperature regimes. The local temperatures approximated closely the large-scale temperature. The timing of phyto-and zooplankton maxima (clearwater phase) were negatively related to the temperature. Thus, with a temperature increase both occurred earlier. The intensity of the spring algal maximum was negatively related to its timing, whereas no clear relation between the timing and intensity of the clearwater phase (zooplankton maximum) could be obtained.					von Storch, Hans/J-4165-2012	von Storch, Hans/0000-0002-5825-8069													1354-1013					OCT	1997	3	5					429	438		10.1046/j.1365-2486.1997.00080.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2486.1997.00080.x													WOS:A1997YA08900005
J	Soukup, JC; Wisenden, BD				Soukup, Jack C.; Wisenden, Brian D.			Predator recognition learning by northern redbelly dace Chrosomus eos from a small kettle lake with a dynamic predator community	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Predation, and the risk of predation, shape the ecology, behavior, and evolution of many species. Small fishes navigate a perilous landscape of risk in the shallow waters of the littoral zone. Moreover, in small lakes, the predator community can be dynamic due to stochastic colonization and extirpation events. These conditions select for the ability by small fish to acquire recognition of novel predators through associative learning. Chemical cues associated with predation events, such as damage-released chemical cues from conspecifics, and the odor of predators, inform prey of the presence of risk, and facilitate acquired recognition of novel predator odor. Deming Lake, MN, is a small meromictic lake with intermittent connections to neighboring lakes in the watershed. Annual sampling of the littoral fish community between the years 2000 and 2023 reveals a history of colonization and extirpation by relatively large-bodied species such as yellow perch Perca flavescens and pumpkinseed sunfish Lepomis gibbosus. Ice cover data, combined with limnological depth profiles of dissolved oxygen, confirm that dissolved oxygen is limiting during the winter and consistent with the hypothesis that extirpation of large-bodied species in Deming Lake is likely due to winter anoxia. These data set the stage for an experimental demonstration of acquired recognition of the odor of allopatric rock bass Ambloplites rupestris by bass-naive northern redbelly dace Chrosomus eos from Deming Lake. Rock bass have been absent from Deming Lake since at least the year 2000. Predator-recognition learning allows redbelly dace, and many other small-bodied fishes that face variable predator species over ontogenetic, spatial, and temporal scales, a mechanism to adapt quickly to indicators of predation risk.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				DEC	2023	106	12					2193	2204		10.1007/s10641-023-01500-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-023-01500-3		DEC 2023											WOS:001131514000001

Recent experimental and field studies on temperate shallow lakes indicate that nitrogen may play a greater role in their functioning than previously thought. Several studies document that abundance and richness of submerged macrophytes, both central in shallow lake ecology, may decrease with increasing nitrogen loading, especially at high phosphorus levels. However, the role of nitrogen in warm lakes with fluctuating water regimes remains to be described in detail. 2. The effect of increasing nitrate and phosphate concentrations on submerged macrophyte growth was examined in a 3-month mesocosm experiment conducted in summer in a shallow freshwater lake on the north western coast of Turkey with a Mediterranean climate. Twenty four field mesocosms, open to the sediment and atmosphere, were stocked with Myriophyllum spicatum shoots and small cyprinid fish. Three nitrate loadings in combination with two phosphate loadings were applied in a fourfold replicated design. 3. Mean +/- SD nutrient concentrations maintained throughout the experiment were 0.55 +/- 0.17, 2.2 +/- 0.97, 9.2 +/- 5.45 mg L-1 total nitrogen and 55 +/- 19.2, 73 +/- 22.9 mu g L-1 total phosphorus. Mean periphyton biomass increased with increasing nutrient concentrations and peaked at the highest nitrogen and phosphorus loadings, while the mean phytoplankton biomass remained relatively low in all treatments. 4. Percent volume inhabited (% PVI) by macrophytes throughout the experiment and total macrophyte biomass at the end of the experiment did not differ among treatments. In addition to stocked M. spicatum, Ceratophyllum demersum and Potamogeton crispus appeared in the majority of the mesocosms. The plants grew continuously up to 50% PVI throughout the experiment and remained resilient to shading provided by periphyton and phytoplankton. 5. The mean summer air temperature in 2007 was 2.2 degrees C higher than the average of the last 32 years, which resulted in a water level decrease of 0.3 m in the mesocosms over three months. This might have counteracted the shading of submerged macrophytes provided by phytoplankton and periphyton. The results of the experiment are consistent with observations of higher macrophyte resilience to nutrient loading in Mediterranean lakes compared with northern temperate lakes.

The lakes are among the clearest known, with extinction coefficients as low as 0.031 for blue light in Lake Vanda and 0.069 for green light in Lake Bonney. Temperature and conductivity measurements in a shallow lake on Cape Evans, Antarctica, suggest a simple freezing-out process as the possible origin of the monimolimnionic salt concentration in Lake Vanda. The lakes have a variety of living organisms but low standing crops and production rates. Many of the organisms are facultatively heterotrophic and may use dissolved organic substances for maintenance in the dark half of the year.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1967	12	2					295	+		10.4319/lo.1967.12.2.0295	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1967.12.2.0295													WOS:A19679423500014

We use high-resolution WorldView-1/2 satellite mapping and in situ measurements to characterize supraglacial water storage, drainage pattern, and discharge across 6,812 km(2) of southwest Greenland in July 2012, after a record melt event. Efficient surface drainage was routed through 523 high-order stream/river channel networks, all of which terminated in moulins before reaching the ice edge. Low surface water storage (3.6 +/- 0.9 cm), negligible impoundment by supraglacial lakes or topographic depressions, and high discharge to moulins (2.54-2.81 cm.d(-1)) indicate that the surface drainage system conveyed its own storage volume every < 2 d to the bed. Moulin discharges mapped inside similar to 52% of the source ice watershed for Isortoq, a major proglacial river, totaled similar to 41-98% of observed proglacial discharge, highlighting the importance of supraglacial river drainage to true outflow from the ice edge. However, Isortoq discharges tended lower than runoff simulations from the Modele Atmospherique Regional (MAR) regional climate model (0.056-0.112 km(3).d(-1) vs. similar to 0.103 km(3).d(-1)), and when integrated over the melt season, totaled just 37-75% of MAR, suggesting nontrivial subglacial water storage even in this melt-prone region of the ice sheet. We conclude that (i) the interior surface of the ice sheet can be efficiently drained under optimal conditions, (ii) that digital elevation models alone cannot fully describe supraglacial drainage and its connection to subglacial systems, and (iii) that predicting outflow from climate models alone, without recognition of subglacial processes, may overestimate true meltwater export from the ice sheet to the ocean.

As the global in-situ network of gauge stations progressively falls out of use, whilst demands on water resources escalate [2], the importance of a remote measurement capability continues to increase. This paper presents an analysis of the Ku band echoes over inland water, with a global analysis of the contribution of the EnviSat RA-2 to inland water height measurement, showing that 15,067 height time series have successfully been retrieved. Analysis of the samples of unaveraged echoes that are available at 1800Hz demonstrates that the higher Pulse Repetition Frequency allows successful measurement of smaller water surfaces, illustrating the future potential of Sentinel-3 for inland water measurement.

However, most current studies only focused on daily or seasonal scales to obtain a relatively coarse resolution result. To explore the possibility of fine changes occurring within a day in Lake Taihu (China), the area coverage of surface cyanobacterial blooms was quantified from the hourly Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data using a GOCI-derived cyanobacterial index. Based on that, diurnal change characteristics were explored at two scales, and the environmental impacts were investigated. For that, an classification method was first designed to identify the types of diurnal change patterns of cyanobacterial blooms automatically. This method classified the patterns into four types, including the decreasing (Type1), decreasing first and then increasing (Type2), increasing (Type3), increasing first and then decreasing (Type4). Based on that, the types of diurnal change patterns of blooms in Lake Taihu (from April 1, 2011 to October 31, 2020) were identified at pixel (500 m) and synoptic scales. Results indicated that Type1 and Type3 were two hot diurnal change patterns of blooms, and lakeshore was the hotspot occurring severe diurnal changes, and autumn was the hot season occurring frequent diurnal changes. Specifically, hotspot of Type1 was lakeshore, while hotspot of Type3 was Central Regions. Environmental impacts were analyzed at two scales. At pixel scale (500 m), diurnal variation of temperature affected the regional occurence of each type of diurnal changes patterns of blooms, and the afternoon temperature played the most critical role (p < 0.001, N = 8316). The occurrence frequency of Type1 was positively (R = 0.41) related with the afternoon temperature, and the occurrence frequency of Type3 was negatively (R =-0.37) related with it. Diurnal variation of wind speed was another key factor impacting the occurrence of obvious diurnal blooms changes, and the wind impacts should be distinguished when the wind speed was over or below 3.5 m/s. At synoptic scale, the interaction of multi environmental factors influenced the diurnal change degree of blooms area, and the environmental contributions were 71%.Comparing with the existing manual classifying workat synoptic scale, the designed classification method can identify the types of diurnal change patterns of blooms at a higher spatial resolution (500 m). These explorations on diurnal dynamics of cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Taihu provide a new insight for advanced cyanobacteria dynamics studies and regional water management.					; ZHANG, Xiang/H-3158-2013; Zhang, Xiang/H-3158-2013	Chen, Nengcheng/0000-0002-3521-9972; Zhang, Xiang/0000-0002-1017-742X													0301-4797	1095-8630				MAY 15	2022	310								114782	10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.114782	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.114782		MAR 2022						35247688					WOS:000781133500005
J	Solarski, M; Rzetala, M				Solarski, Maksymilian; Rzetala, Mariusz			Changes in the Thickness of Ice Cover on Water Bodies Subject to Human Pressure (Silesian Upland, Southern Poland)	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												The paper discusses the reasons behind the variation in the thickness of ice on 39 anthropogenic water bodies located in the Silesian Upland (southern Poland). The studies were conducted over the course of three consecutive winter seasons. The measurements and observations were scheduled every 2 days during the freezing and ablation of the ice, and every 4 days when ice cover was present. Each time the thickness of the ice cover and the snow layer covering it were measured. The results show that the 35 water bodies studied are characterized by a similar-quasi-natural-ice regime, in which ice thickness variation depends mostly on the air temperature and the thickness of the snow layer covering the ice. The ice thickness on those water bodies does not significantly differ from that observed on lakes located in northern Poland, measuring on average from circa 4 to 21 cm, and with maximum thicknesses ranging from circa 14 to 40 cm, depending on the season. Four water bodies are characterized by different ice conditions; in their case the average and maximum ice thickness was significantly lower. In the Niezdara N water body this was caused by the inflow of warmer potamic water (quasi-natural regime), whereas in Pod Borem, Sosnicka, and Somerek it was caused by discharges of warm mine water (anthropogenic regime).

The micropollutant hotspots above the wastewater outfall present a potential ecotoxicological risk, yet the spatial extent of the plume and the associated ecotoxicological risk zone remain unclear. This work combines the two main processes affecting the spreading of the plume, namely dilution of micropollutants due to mixing and degradation by photolysis, into a coupled hydrodynamic-photolysis model, with which we estimated the spatial extent of the risk zone in Vidy Bay. The concentration of micropollutants around the wastewater outfall was simulated for typical wind scenarios and seasons relevant to Vidy Bay, and the resulting ecotoxicological risk was evaluated. Specifically, we determined the direct and indirect photolysis rate constants for 24 wastewater-derived micropollutants and implemented these in a hydrodynamic particle tracking model, which tracked the movement of water parcels from the wastewater outfall. Simulations showed that owing to thermal stratification, the zone of ecotoxicological risk is largest in summer and extends horizontally over 300 m from the outfall. Photolysis processes contribute to reducing the plume extent mainly under unstratified conditions when the plume surfaces. Moreover, it was shown that only a few compounds, mainly antibiotics, dominate the total ecotoxicological risk.					; Barry, D./C-6077-2008; Barry, David/C-6077-2008; Kohn, Tamar/H-1430-2011	Kohn, Tamar/0000-0003-0395-6561; Barry, David/0000-0002-8621-0425; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				AUG 20	2013	47	16					9207	9216		10.1021/es401294c	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es401294c								23919891					WOS:000323471700027

Ciliates from 111 taxa were detected, including new records of 24 species for the Baltic Sea. The ciliate taxa were grouped into size-categories and trophic guilds and their species composition, abundance and biomass were monitored in different seasons. Two distinct associations replaced each other during seasonal succession at water temperatures 512C. During the warm season (late AprilOctober) ciliate communities were composed essentially of pico- and nano-filterers (mostly algivorous) that became less important in the cold season (Octoberearly April). The predator, Monodinium balbiani, and bactivorous peritrichs were characteristic of the warm season, while in the cold season, other predatory (Lacrymaria coronata group) and bactivorous (Cyclidium spp., Aspidisca sp., Chilodonella sp.) ciliates occurred. The most abundant size groups were small ciliates (2030 m) and nanociliates (20 m). A proportion of large ciliates (60 m) increased in the cold season due to the appearance of benthic species in the plankton. Total ciliate abundance and biomass ranged 0.1210.3 10(3) ind L-1 and 0.353.3 g C L-1, respectively. An unusual winter peak of the ciliate Trithigmostoma sp. was observed (32.8 g C L-1) although generally the overall ciliate numbers decreased in the cold season.					; Skarlato, Sergei/W-4663-2017; Telesh, Irena/N-4342-2016; Mironova, Ekaterina/AAC-3252-2022	Skarlato, Sergei/0000-0001-7579-7227; Mironova, Ekaterina/0000-0002-9557-6031; Telesh, Irena/0000-0002-4167-3821; 													0142-7873	1464-3774				MAR	2012	34	3					208	220		10.1093/plankt/fbr095	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbr095													WOS:000300228000003

J	TONN, WM; HOLOPAINEN, IJ; PASZKOWSKI, CA				TONN, WM; HOLOPAINEN, IJ; PASZKOWSKI, CA			DENSITY-DEPENDENT EFFECTS AND THE REGULATION OF CRUCIAN CARP POPULATIONS IN SINGLE-SPECIES PONDS	ECOLOGY												Crucian carp (Carassius carassius) is often the only fish species present in small ponds of northern Europe. Such populations are typically at high densities and consist primarily of small, relatively slender, and short-lived fish; populations in multispecies assemblages in lakes display opposite traits. Field and laboratory experiments have implicated predation as an important mechanism structuring crucian populations in multispecies assemblages. To investigate the role(s) of density dependence in structuring pond populations, we manipulated densities of crucians stocked into four sections of a subdivided natural pond in Finland. Mortality of stocked fish during the 3-mo experiment was low (0-11%) and unrelated to density. Growth rates of crucians were both size and density dependent. Larger fish did not noticeably grow in either high- or low-density sections, but growth of smaller size classes was 22% greater in low-density sections. Lower densities and smaller sizes of zooplankton, especially of inshore cladocerans that are an important food resource for smaller crucians, indicated that resource limitation caused by exploitation competition was an important density-dependent process restricting growth of small fish in high-density sections. Crucians rely on reserves of glycogen, stored in the liver and muscle, to fuel the over-winter anaerobic metabolism that allows them to maintain populations in ponds where winter hypoxia eliminates other fishes. Liver size was significantly larger and glycogen levels were 82% higher in our low-density pond sections than in high-density sections. At higher, but not lower, densities, relative liver size and glycogen levels decreased with body size; combined with the lack of growth of large fish, this indicates that density-dependent energy limitations contribute to the short life-spans and rarity of large fish that characterize pond populations. An increase in relative body depth can be induced in crucians by the presence of piscivorous fish, reducing vulnerability to predation. It has been proposed that increased body depth incurs a substantial energy cost during swimming and should be restricted to specific size classes in populations sympatric with predators. However, in our experiment, crucians of all sizes became significantly deeper bodied, which contributed to higher condition factors in low-density vs. high-density sections. This morphological change, occurring in the absence of piscivores, suggests that energy benefits (accumulation of overwintering reserves) can override any proposed costs for this sluggish, but metabolically unique, fish. Crucian carp successfully reproduced in all sections during the experiment, but growth and recruitment of 0+ fish (young of year) were strongly and negatively related to the numbers of older fish present. The observed density-dependent recruitment was likely caused by starvation-induced mortality and cannibalism; reduced growth observed in O+ fish would also be expected to cause higher first-winter mortality, reducing further recruitment at higher densities. Density dependence has a variety of regulatory effects on pond populations of crucian carp that contribute to their persistence and resilience.

In the North China Plain, floating photovoltaic (FPV) systems have been extensively installed across subsidence wetlands created by underground coal mining. However, there have been no studies investigating the effects of FPV systems on waterbird communities. During the wintering and migrating seasons of 2016-2017 and 2021-2022, we carried out waterbird surveys in subsidence wetlands with and without FPV systems in the Huainan-Huaibei coal mining area in the North China Plain to examine the effects of FPV systems on waterbird communities. After installation of FPV systems, waterbird numbers increased, but Simpson diversity and Pielou evenness decreased, with no significant changes in species richness. The presence of FPV systems resulted in decrease in the proportion of diving birds but increase in the proportion of vegetation gleaners. The FPV systems leaded to decrease in the proportion of herons in October but increase in other months. Besides the effect of FPV systems, we also found that Simpson diversity and the proportion of ducks increased, while the occurrence rate of shorebirds and gulls decreased from 2016 to 2021. Our results indicate that the cover of FPV systems may homogenize waterbird communities across subsidence wetlands. This study provides the first information on the effects of the FPV systems on waterbirds in artificial wetlands and highlights the need for further research to understand the ecological implications of FPV installations in wetland ecosystems.					li, chunlin/KFS-0761-2024	Zhang, Yong/0000-0001-7054-4634													0301-4797	1095-8630				JAN 1	2024	349								119417	10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.119417	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.119417		OCT 2023						37890299					WOS:001105819700001

Ten-year seasonal campaigns had as their main purpose the complex characterisation of the quality of the lacustrine water, which was performed by interpreting the results of field measurements with reference to their classification into quality classes. A total of 136 lakes were analysed. This number was sufficient to cover the entire surface of Romania and to portray the present state of its lake water quality. Most lakes in Romania, especially those analysed in this study, are naturally anthropogenic. Those of large dimensions are located in the mountains or along the Danube. Most of the natural lakes are small and have no environmental or economic importance (except along the coastal plain and the Danube). The lakes analysed, although situated in different physical and geographical conditions, fall, in the majority of cases, within the category of good waters in terms of their quality (class I), and eutrophic, hypertrophic or mesotrophic in terms of trophicity. Because most of these lakes are man-made, it is clear that they are artificially maintained at this point. Most mountain lakes, or volcanic units, are ultraoligotrophic or oligotrophic. Most water-supply lakes are heavily used by the main settlements and for agriculture. Eutrophication is a phenomenon absent from the anthropogenic lakes and is rarely found in the natural lakes.					; Stoleriu, Cristian/O-6224-2014; Sandu, Ion/B-5797-2012	Stoleriu, Cristian Constantin/0000-0001-8852-2724; Sandu, Ion/0000-0003-4088-8967													0034-7752					MAR	2014	65	3					344	349																WOS:000335294800018
J	Overduin, PP; Kane, DL				Overduin, P. P.; Kane, D. L.			Frost boils and soil ice content: Field observations	PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES												Our aim is to measure and explain the seasonal changes in soil ice content in the frost boils of Galbraith Lake, Alaska. Instruments were installed in a frost boil to monitor the ground surface position and soil state over a period of 4 years. By comparing the subsidence and thaw rates, we calculate the soil ice content as a function of depth. Measured soil temperatures, liquid water contents and bulk apparent thermal conductivities are used to estimate latent heat production and release in the soil. The frost boil heaves during freezing and settles during thaw while the surrounding tundra heaves negligibly, but subsides measurably. Despite large changes in freezing rates from year to year, total heave and its distribution across the frost boil are similar between years. Winter air temperature and snow depth influence the freezing rate and ice distribution as a function of depth, but not the overall heave. This suggests that heave is controlled by water availability rather than the rate of heat removal from the soil.

Observations were categorized into three stages based on the ice growth and surface condition: bare ice, snow cover, and melting. During the bare ice stage, the mean surface albedo was 0.35 with a decreasing trend due to the accumulation of wind-blown sediment on the ice surface (range: 0.99-1.87 g m-2). Two snowfall events occurred during the snow cover stage, significantly increasing the surface albedo to 0.91. During the melting stage, the albedo decreased at a decay rate of 0.20-0.30/day. Four existing albedo schemes were evaluated but found unsuitable for Lake Ulansu. A new surface albedo scheme was proposed by incorporating the existing albedo schemes with the measured data. This scheme incorporated the effect of sediment content on bare ice albedo for the first time. It demonstrated a modelling efficiency of 0.933 over the entire 3-month period, which was used to evaluate the fit between the predicted and observed values. When validated with albedo observations from other winters, it achieved a modelling efficiency of 0.940. The closer the value is to 1, the better the model's predictive accuracy, indicating a higher level of reliability in the model's performance. This scheme has potential applicability to other lakes in the Central Asian arid climate zone, which is characterized by low precipitation, frequent sandstorms, and intense solar radiation.

The model uses a simple ice blocking (IC0) parameterization for ice-wave damping, so ice-covered portions of the lakes are treated as land in the modeling system. Although simple and effective, the simple block can impede forecasting by eliminating wave forecast guidance from areas with thin or partial ice cover. We evaluate 12 ice-wave damping parameterizations within WAVEWATCH III (WW3, version 6.07.1) for Lake Erie, by comparing model results against wave observations made at several locations using moored acoustic wave and current profilers during the winters of 2010-2011 and 2012-2013. The comparisons show that the IC4M4 module performs the best among 12 ice modules with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.32-0.39 m and a root bias of -0.06 to -0.11 m, outperforming the existing IC0 parameterization (RMSE: 0.46-0.59 m; bias: -0.23 to -0.34 m) during the 2010-2011 analysis year. WW3 ice modules are mostly derived from measurements and studies of the Arctic and Antarctic Ocean. The dominant wave frequency is about 0.05 similar to 0.10 Hz in the Arctic Ocean compared to 0.15 similar to 0.2 Hz in the lake. Thus formulas built on frequency based on the studies from deep oceans may not be suitable for the shallow lakes because they cause too much damping. Although the IC4M4 ice module is from the study of the Antarctic Ocean , the wave attenuation formula based on incoming wave height is also suitable for Lake Erie.					; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/AAA-5852-2021	Frank, Kaitlyn/0000-0001-9507-6312; Wang, Jia/0000-0003-4154-9721; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/0000-0001-5466-6332; Hawley, Nathan/0000-0001-7243-982X													2169-9275	2169-9291				JAN	2025	130	1							e2024JC021146	10.1029/2024JC021146	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024JC021146													WOS:001397492100001
J	FEDO, CM; MILLER, JMG				FEDO, CM; MILLER, JMG			EVOLUTION OF A MIOCENE HALF-GRABEN BASIN, COLORADO RIVER EXTENSIONAL CORRIDOR, SOUTHEASTERN CALIFORNIA	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The < 1-km-thick, middle Miocene, predominantly sedimentary succession exposed within the northern Sacramento Mountains contains many characteristics of sedimentation in an extension-generated half-graben basin. These deposits constitute the uppermost plate of a three-plate detachment-fault system. Three facies associations are recognized and are inferred to represent (1) small, high-gradient, gravity-dominated alluvial fans; (2) lake and lake margin; and (3) large, low-gradient, fluvially influenced alluvial fans. The small, high-gradient fans consist mainly of red and green, matrix-supported, boulder breccia and conglomerate, interpreted as debris flows, and less abundant gravity-glide blocks and clast-supported boulder breccia. Lacustrine deposits consist of green mudstone and sandstone, tan sandstones organized into fining-upward sequences (< 2 m thick), and red, cross-bedded sandstones. The large, low-gradient fans consist of interbedded, red, crudely stratified gravelly sandstone and matrix-supported cobble conglomerate interpreted as mixed fluvial and debris-flow sedimentation. Lacustrine deposits are intimately mixed with the small, high-gradient fans in the southwest end of the basin. The large, low-gradient fans are extensive in the northeast end of the basin. This permits the interpretation that the basin opened as an asymmetric half graben prior to 14.6 +/- 0.9 Ma (tilted dated lavas) and after 18.5 +/- 0.2 Ma (age of older, middle-plate, probable Peach Springs Tuff equivalent), along a gently northeast-dipping detachment fault. Following deposition, extension segmented the basin into numerous west-southwest tilted blocks, which were then covered by a thin veneer of gravels and finally by the lavas of Flattop Mountain at 14.6 +/- 0.2 Ma. Such overlapping of dates between dipping and flat-lying strata indicates that a significant amount of sedimentation and tilting can occur rapidly during crustal extension.

We analyzed spatial variability of F of CH4 and CO2, as well as C-aq and k in 22 European lakes during late summer. F and k were higher in the lake centers, leading to considerable bias when extrapolating single-point chamber measurements to whole-lake estimates. The ratio of our empirical k estimates to wind speed-modeled k was related to lake size and shape, suggesting a lake morphology effect on the relationship between wind speed and k. This indicates that the error inherent to established wind speed models can be reduced by determining k and C-aq at multiple sites on lakes to calibrate wind speed-modeled k to the local system.

In this study, we hypothesized that microtopography was the primary control over the spatial patterns of near surface soil moisture. Near surface soil moisture measurements were collected in the summers of 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 in the fetch of an eddy flux tower (0.5 km(2)). Results confirmed the expected relationship between intra- and inter-seasonal variations in near surface soil moisture and variations in precipitation. However, over two time periods, near surface soil moisture increased without corresponding measured precipitation inputs and this was attributed to fog and dew, which are difficult to measure, and/or the melting of the active layer. Spatial variations in near surface soil moisture are largely controlled by microtopography in areas characterized by high centered polygons and troughs. In areas without large variations in microtopography, macrotopography, in the form of drained thaw lakes, has a substantial control over near surface soil moisture.

Predictions of the metabolic capabilities of these communities were performed with FAPROTAX using 16S rRNA sequencing data. The versatility for metabolizing carbon sources was also assessed in three of the lakes using Biolog Ecoplates. Relevant differences among lakes and within lake depths were observed. A total of 23 metabolic activities associated to the main biogeochemical cycles were foreseen, namely, carbon (11), nitrogen (4), sulfur (5), iron (2), and hydrogen (1). The aerobic metabolisms dominated, although anaerobic respiration was also relevant near the lakes' bottom as well as in shallow eutrophic lakes with higher nutrient and organic matter contents. Capacity for using carbon sources further than those derived from the fresh autochthonous primary production was detected. Clustering of the lakes based on metabolic capabilities of their microbial communities was determined by their trophic status, with functional diversity increasing with trophic status. Data were also examined using a co-occurrence network approach, indicating that the lakes and their catchments have to be perceived as connected and interacting macrosystems, where either stochastic or deterministic mechanisms for the assembling of communities may occur depending on the lake's isolation. The hydrological processes within catchments and the potential metabolic plasticity of these biological communities must be considered for future climate scenarios in the region, which may extend the growing season and increase biomass circulation.</p>					Miralles-Lorenzo, Javier/AAB-4584-2019; Rochera, Carlos/M-2932-2014; Quesada, Antonio/L-2430-2013; Mozo, Antonio/AAE-3707-2020; Camacho, Antonio/I-3417-2015	Rochera, Carlos/0000-0002-8294-4755; Quesada, Antonio/0000-0002-8913-5993; Miralles-Lorenzo, Javier/0000-0002-1690-9978; Camacho, Antonio/0000-0003-0841-2010														2076-2607				OCT	2021	9	10							2077	10.3390/microorganisms9102077	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9102077								34683398					WOS:000712238700001

Using antioxidant changes in liver and gonads of Oreochromis niloticus as biomarkers for the assessment of heavy metals pollution at Sharkia province, Egypt	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												The work was aimed to assess the heavy metals concentrations in the Sharkia Governorate, Egypt. The determination of heavy metal bioaccumulation and their antioxidant alterations on Oreochromis niloticus were considered. The gonads and the liver of the fishes were analyzed for essential metals (Cu, Mn, Fe & Zn) and non-essential metals (Pb) levels seasonally and their bioaccumulation factors. The results revealed that concentrations of the metals differ significantly between the gonads and the liver of the sampled fishes. During summer, liver bioaccumulation of the metals was in the order of Mn > Pb > Fe > Zn > Cu at area I and Mn> Pb> Zn> Fe > Cu at area II. However, the degree of tissue alterations in the gonads can accumulate the heavy metals in the following order Mn >Zn>Pb >Fe>Cu and Mn> Pb >Zn> Fe at the same season, for the areas I and II, respectively. The bioaccumulation of heavy metals in the liver tissue was higher than in the gonads of the O. niloticus. The antioxidant changes in the liver and gonads were mildly and moderately damaged, respectively. These indicated that Zn, Cd, Pb, and Fe polluted the Sharkia Governorate in the two selected areas. Elevation of lipid peroxidation in fishes was parallel with increasing the activity of endogenous antioxidants that could be to compensate for the stress. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Streamflow and suspended sediment transport are limited, on an annual time scale, by the supply of snow and sediment in the watershed. Suspended sediment yield from the watershed was only 0.46 t km(-2), which is lower than any previously published yield for a stream in the High Arctic. Snowmelt runoff accounted for 88% of the annual suspended sediment load, whereas 6 and 9% were transported in response to a slushflow event and summer rainfall, respectively These measurements provide no direct evidence that modern-day sediment delivery to Lake Sophia is related to fluctuations in air temperature, which has implications for the paleoenvironmental signal preserved in Lake Sophia's laminated sediments. We suggest that on-site sediment transport studies are necessary to establish the relationships among geology, geography, climate, and hydrology unique to each watershed-lake system and need to be an integral part of any calibration attempt. Additional yeats of data are needed however to define the interannual variability of streamflow and sediment transport in response to climate.

Caspary) infested Lake Pearl, Orange County, Florida [USA] during the summer of 1980. Portions of 1/2 of the lake (experimental data) were treated 4 times with herbicides to maintain recreational use of the north end of the lake. Periphyton chlorophyll a and biovolume increased, and hydrilla was reduced, following treatments 1 and 2. Treatment 3 was less effective at reducing hydrilla; but an increase in the periphyton community occurred. Treatment 4 was followed by an increase in periphyton, but variation within experimental samples was so great that this increase could be considered significant.																			0146-6623						1982	20	JAN					17	19																WOS:A1982NL70200005

Cutthroat trout are more abundant in the southern part of southeastern Alaska, where there are more accessible lakes and large rivers for anadromous fish, and are less abundant along the north Gulf Coast. Mixed-stock overwintering aggregations of sea-run cutthroat trout rarely exceed 2,000 individuals and more commonly number only a few hundred. Population indices over time are available for only two wintering lakes in southeastern Alaska, and in both instances these indices are higher now than in earlier years. Anecdotal information shows declines in some small lake populations after angler exploitation, but extent of population decline is unknown.																					0-913235-99-7				1997							80	83																WOS:000078223100013

At the same time, geese have shifted from natural foraging habitats to securing most of their nutritional demands from agricultural fields, leading to crop damage and conflict with agriculture. We studied field use by Greylag Geese (Anser anser) in the agricultural landscape surrounding a main breeding and moulting lake in Sweden. From 2012 to 2016, weekly roadside surveys were conducted from May to July. Data were collected on goose numbers, crop type and sward height in agricultural fields. Using a compositional analysis, we demonstrate that Greylag Geese show a strong selection for ley and pasture fields compared to other crop types (rank order: ley/pasture > oat > barley > wheat > other crops). This selection was consistent across years and between pre- and post-moult. Aside from ley and pasture, no other crop types were selected for, as they were used less than expected given their availability. Irrespective of crop type, geese foraged predominantly on short (0-10 cm) swards. The strong selection for ley and pasture may have been driven by higher nutritional quality of short, managed grass swards relative to other available foods. This suggests that during the summer grass fields may be more vulnerable to damage compared to other crop types. Our study provides a deeper understanding of the ecology of Greylag Geese, which may be used to inform management strategies focused on mitigating crop damage and alleviating conflict.

This bloom alga, which appeared for June-July, contained no P. catenata and in August-September carried some Pseudanabaena trichomes. P. catenata can grow into G. echinulata cells and can destroy the host alga totally. A heterotrophic growth on cell-lysates of host alga is possible for P. catenata. The presence of such endophyte can be considered as a risk factor for the host alga and thus can be used to explain the recessive phenomenon of G. echinulata in the Ploner Lake [West Germany].																			0003-9136						1983	97	3					320	328																WOS:A1983RA07600003

However, NH4+ recycling rates along nutrient gradients at river similar to lake transitional zones and the extent to which NH4+ regeneration can compensate for consumption have been poorly studied. In August (flood period) and November (normal period), 2016, NH4+ regeneration rates (REGs) and potential uptake rates (U(pot)s) were measured in northwestern Lake Taihu and adjacent rivers. Results showed that the REGs ranged from 0.09 to 330 mu mol N L-1 h(-1) and the U(pot)s ranged from 0.20 to 4.88 mu mot N L-1 h(-1), with higher recycling rates occurring at the river sites. Yet, the lake sites showed significantly higher water column NH4+ demand (WCAD) than that of the adjacent river sites during both seasons (p < 0.05), probably as a result of the low REGs and the lack of exogenous nitrogen (N) inputs. The flood period showed significantly higher REG and U-pot values than those of the normal period (p < 0.05), probably controlled by higher water temperature and algal biomass. This study confirms that regenerated NH4+ was more important than the ambient NH4+- for sustaining cyanobacterial blooms in northwestern Lake Taihu and indicates that the river-lake transitional zones are key areas for N control in this hypereutrophic system.

Our objectives were to assess the relative ability of measures of size and three versions of condition index to predict the lipid content of fingerling walleyes Sander vitreus from aquacultural or natural environments. Fingerlings were either intensively cultured through the fall of 1994, were stocked and spent 3-4 months at large in four lakes, or were intensively cultured and maintained overwinter in hatchery ponds. Variation in condition indices accounted for less than 35% of the variation in lipid. No index performed substantially better than the others. The relationship of condition to lipid content was not consistent between environments or seasons (ANCOVA: F = 403.4, P < 0.0005). Relationships were also different among the four lake populations (ANCOVA: F = 33.9 P < 0.0005). Inconsistencies seem to be the result of differences in seasonal and environmental stress. The utility of condition indices as surrogates for body composition should be verified with each use. Furthermore, comparisons of fingerlings from aquacultural environments with fingerlings from natural environments are unlikely to be physiologically meaningful.																			1522-2055					JUL	2004	66	3					237	242		10.1577/A03-033.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/A03-033.1													WOS:000222974600011

While these characteristics have been investigated independently, a holistic analysis integrating them is potentially more informative. Using observations, climate projections from the CMIP5 model ensemble, and historical and future population estimates, we apply the IPCC risk framework to examine present and projected future potential impact (PI) of summer heat stress for the contiguous United States (CONUS) as a function of non-stationary HS characteristics and population exposure. We find that the PI of short-to-medium duration (1-7 days) HS events is likely to increase more than three-fold across densely populated regions of the U.S. including the Northeast, Southeast Piedmont, Midwest, and parts of the Desert Southwest by late this century (2060-2099) under the highest emissions scenario. The contribution from climate change alone more than doubles the impact in the coastal Pacific Northwest, central California, and the Great Lakes region, implying a substantial increase in HS risk without aggressive mitigation efforts.

Seasonal resource limitation of heterotrophic biofilms in boreal streams	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Unraveling the potentially shifting controls over microbial activity among habitats and across seasonal transitions is critical for understanding how freshwater ecosystems influence broader elemental cycles, and how these systems may respond to global changes. We used nutrient-diffusing substrates to investigate seasonal patterns and constraints on microbial activity of biofilms in streams draining distinct landscape features of the boreal biome (forests, mires, and lakes). Microbial respiration (MR) largely mirrored spatial and temporal variation in water temperature. However, limitation by labile carbon (C) was a constraint to microbial activity during ice-covered periods, when MR of control nutrient-diffusing substrates fell below rates predicted from stream temperature alone. Variation in C limitation among the study streams was reflective of putative organic C availability, with C limitation of biofilms weakest in the dissolved organic C (DOC)-rich, mire-outlet stream and greatest in the relatively DOC-poor, forest stream. Incidences of nutrient limitation were only observed during warmer months. Our study illustrates how variation in processes mediated by heterotrophic biofilms and seasonal shifts in resource limitation can emerge in a stream network draining a heterogeneous landscape. In addition, our results show that, for a large portion of the year, heterotrophic processes in boreal streams can be strongly limited by the availability of labile C, despite high DOC concentrations. Metabolic constraints to dissolved organic matter processing at near-freezing temperatures, coupled with hydrological controls over the delivery of more labile organic resources to streams (e.g., soil freezing and flooding), have potentially strong influences on the productivity of boreal streams.					; McKie, Brendan/C-9376-2013; Sponseller, Ryan/ABI-7338-2020; Laudon, Hjalmar/J-3074-2013	Burrows, Ryan/0000-0002-3296-1864; Laudon, Hjalmar/0000-0001-6058-1466													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2017	62	1					164	176		10.1002/lno.10383	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10383													WOS:000393804600011

Ice Wedge Degradation and Stabilization Impact Water Budgets and Nutrient Cycling in Arctic Trough Ponds	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Trough ponds are ubiquitous features of Arctic landscapes and an important component of freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Permafrost thaw causes ground subsidence, creating depressions that gather water, creating ponds. Permafrost thaw also releases solutes and nutrients, which may fertilize these newly formed ponds. We measured water budget elements and chloride, ammonium, and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) across a chronosequence of trough ponds representing different stages of ice wedge degradation and stabilization. We developed a coupled hydrologic and biogeochemical model to explore how ice wedge degradation affects hydrology and nutrient availability in trough ponds in the advanced degradation stages (DAs), which are characterized by deep troughs with warmer temperatures relative to the other stages. DAs experienced greater evaporation than the other stages, and subsurface inflows entered the DAs from a wide area. Chloride accumulated in the ponds with time since thaw, implying that subsurface fluxes are delivering solutes from the thawing permafrost. Ammonium accumulated at high rates in the initial degradation stage and was seasonally depleted over the summer in all degradation stages. Ammonium trends in the DAs were consistent with high concentration inflows and in-pond assimilation at rates between 0.37 and 2.0 mg N m(-2) day(-1). Seasonal DON trends indicated that the accumulation of recalcitrant organic matter may eventually limit aquatic ecosystem production and foster pond infilling. These results provide direct evidence of nutrient release from thawing permafrost and the utilization of these nutrients by Arctic trough pond ecosystems and highlight infilling as a mechanism by which Arctic surface waters may be lost.

Environmental implications of stratification and turbulent mixing in a shallow lake basin	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The extent of stratification and vertical mixing in the water column (7-11 m deep) was investigated over an offshore reef in the western basin of Lake Erie. Measurements reveal that the vertical transport of oxygen and heat is controlled by the complex interaction of several physical mechanisms. Generally, when the wind speed (W) was > 7 m(.)s 1 and the air was cooler than the water (T-air < T-w), the water column was well mixed due to turbulent mixing. However, when W < 7 m(.)s(-1) (similar to 65% of the summer), turbulence was too weak to overcome the stratification and mix the water column. An analysis of 25 years of meteorological data revealed that a period of 4.5 +/- 1.9 days of calm, warm weather (W < 7 m(.)s 1 and T-air > Tw) occurs every year. Results indicate that there is strong probability of hypoxia due to stratification (i.e., when diffusivities < 10(-6) m(2.)s(-)1) and sediment oxygen demand (i.e., 0.1-1.0 g-m-(2 .)day(-1)) during these periods. The environmental implications of stratification to water quality and its effects on benthic organisms, such as the burrowing mayfly (Hexagenia spp.), require further considerations in large temperate lakes and basins that are sufficiently shallow that there is no permanent seasonal stratification.

It has been found that competition between plume buoyancy and background stratification (parameterised as the Richardson number) is crucial in determining whether or not the plume will penetrate through a density interface. In this paper, we present the analysis of field data concerning two hydrothermal sediment-laden plumes in a stratified lake. Measurements of the particle concentration within these plumes have been used to determine their vertical, spatial and temporal development in the water column.

Simultaneous roost counts were undertaken from November-February, covering 17 key sites for the species in southeast Romania, and all major wetlands in the country were surveyed in mid-January as part of the International Waterbird Census. The species was found wintering entirely near large lakes and wetlands in the lowlands of southeast Romania, exclusively concentrated in two regions: Baragan and coastal Dobrogea. Between 2012 and 2022, national totals were estimated at between 8,660 and 23,783 individuals, with an average of 16,322 birds, which represents almost 30% of the global population. Population trends for the species in Romania over the same period are classified as "uncertain". At the regional level, the 10-year period trend shows a moderate increase in Baragan region and a strong increase in coastal Dobrogea, but for the last five years the trend in both regions is uncertain. Solitary birds or small groups might be seen also in other wetlands across the western and eastern lowlands of the country for short periods of time, especially during migration. We found that 25% of observations of the geese were registered outside of the borders of the protected areas, in areas which may hold flocks of over 10,000 Red-breasted Geese. The current vulnerability of this population, and the uncertainty regarding its true global abundance and trends, highlights the need for continuous coordinated counts in the country, in order to understand how the species will adapt to the climate changes, which might have an influence on its total population size and distribution.

Predecessor Rain Events ahead of Tropical Cyclones	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Twenty-eight predecessor rain events (PREs) that occurred over the United States east of the Rockies during 1995-2008 are examined from a synoptic climatology and case study perspective. PREs are coherent mesoscale regions of heavy rainfall, with rainfall rates >= 100 mm (24 h)(-1), that can occur approximately 1000 km poleward of recurving tropical cyclones (TCs). PREs occur most commonly in August and September, and approximately 36 h prior to the arrival of the main rain shield associated with the TC. A distinguishing feature of PREs is that they are sustained by deep tropical moisture that is transported poleward directly from the TC. PREs are high-impact weather events that can often result in significant inland flooding, either from the PRE itself or from the subsequent arrival of the main rain shield associated with the TC that falls onto soils already saturated by the PRE. The composite analysis shows that on the synoptic-scale, PREs form in the equatorward jet-entrance region of a 200-hPa jet on the western flank of a 925-hPa equivalent potential temperature ridge located east of a 700-hPa trough. On the mesoscale, PREs occur in conjunction with low-level frontogenetical forcing along a baroclinic zone where heavy rainfall is focused. A case study analysis was conducted of a PRE ahead of TC Erin (2007) that produced record-breaking rainfall (>250 mm) from southern Minnesota to Lake Michigan. This analysis highlighted the importance of frontogenetical forcing along a low-level baroclinic zone in the presence of deep tropical moisture from TC Erin in producing a long-lived, quasi-stationary mesoscale convective system.

In this statistical technique, preconceptualizations that reflect research questions or existing knowledge of system structure create the initial framework for model development, while both direct and indirect effects and measurement errors are considered. Given the interesting features of this method, it is quite surprising that the number of applications in ecology is limited, and even less common in aquatic ecosystems. This study presents two examples where structural equation modeling is used for exploring ecological structures; i.e., summer epilimnetic phytoplankton dynamics. Both eutrophic (Lake Mendota) and mesotrophic (Lake Washington) conditions were used to test an initial hypothesized model that considered the regulatory role of abiotic factors and biological interactions on lake phytoplankton dynamics and water clarity during the summer stratification period. Generally, the model gave plausible results, while a higher proportion of the observed variability was accounted for in the eutrophic environment. Most importantly, we show that structural equation modeling provided a convenient means for assessing the relative role of several ecological processes (e.g., vertical mixing, intrusions of the hypolimnetic nutrient stock, herbivory) known to determine the levels of water quality variables of management interest (e.g., water clarity, cyanobacteria). A Bayesian hierarchical methodology is also introduced to relax the classical identifiability restrictions and treat them as stochastic. Additional advantages of the Bayesian approach are the flexible incorporation of prior knowledge on parameters, the ability to get information on multimodality in marginal densities (undetectable by standard procedures), and the fact that the structural equation modeling process does not rely on asymptotic theory which is particularly important when the sample size is small (commonly experienced in environmental studies). Special emphasis is given on how this Bayesian methodological framework can be used for assessing eutrophic conditions and assisting water quality management. Structural equation modeling has several attractive features that can be particularly useful to researchers when exploring ecological patterns or disentangling complex environmental management issues.

The paper presents the surge dynamics of one unnamed glacier in Yarkand basin, of Karakoram region between 2000 and 2019 using satellite imagery (e.g., Landsat and Sentinel 2). Also, multiple high-resolution DEMs (e.g., HMA and Cartosat 1) were used to estimate mass transfer from the reservoir zone to the receiving zone. The DEM differencing exhibit maximum thickening of the lower receiving zone was-190 +/- 31 m whereas a maximum thinning of the upper reservoir zone was similar to 17 +/- 31 m between 2018 and 2016. The receiving zone gained 256 +/- 143 +/- 106 m(3) ice mass between 2018 and 2011. The surface displacement was lower than 0.07 +/- 0.02 m d(-1) in the quiescent phase between 2000 and 2011 and it reached to similar to 5 +/- 0.3 m d(-1) in the active phase (autumn 2015). The glacier terminus retreated similar to 765 +/- 89 m from 1978 to 2016 but advanced +681 +/- 57 m during 2016-2019. This analysis indicate that the gradual increase in surface displacement about four years before the onset of the surge, long active phase (three years) and slow termination corroborate partially thermally controlled Svalbard-type surge.

J	SimeNgando, T				SimeNgando, T			Viruses in aquatic ecosystems. A review.	ANNEE BIOLOGIQUE												Even though the contribution of water ecosystems for disseminating enteric viral pathogens has been known for decades, the importance of wild virions iii structuring aquatic communities and food webs has only come to light relatively recently. Evidences of viral infections in both pro-and eukaryotic phytoplankton, as well as in heterotrophic bacterio-and protozooplankton, have recently brought marine biologists to question the impact of viroplankton on processes such as (1) the mortality of microorganisms, (2) the nutrition of heterotrophic protists, (3) the promotion of genetic material exchanges among microbial populations, (4) the maintenance of species diversity, (5) the induction of planktonic aggregates, and (6) the cycling of organic matter in aquatic ecosystems. In this paper, all these points are reviewed and discussed, in the light of recent contributions to the ecology of aquatic viruses, for evidence of the impact of viruses on both steady and non-steady state processes in fresh- and salt-waters. Viruses are ubiquitous, abundant and dynamic components of pelagic ecosystems. They are, undoubtedly, more diversified than the phage-like morphotypes that are generally characterized by the presence of an icosa- or octahedral head and a tail, via observations under electron microscope. The diversity of planktonic viruses is further enhanced from the genetic viewpoint, and likely implies the diversity of sensible hosts. Genetically related marine phages are likely widely distributed in the space (i. e. without significant geographical segregation), suggesting prevalence of a reduced competition among viral ''populations'', and that the main biotic limiting factor for a viral ''species'' production is the density of the sensible host. Some viral ''species'', known from marine systems, typically harbor knob-like projections and long spines (i. e. previously not noted from non.-aquatic habitats), which are suggested to increase the efficiency of hitting a specific host, especially in oligotrophic waters. Despite the general scarcity of viral isolates that lyse ciliated protozooplankton and metazoan zooplankton, it is becoming increasingly evident that most of the pelagic pro-and eukaryotic organisms are subject to infectious attacks from ambient ''free-living'' viruses. Quantitatively, recent total counts from the plankton generally fall in between 10(4) and 10(8) viruses ml(-1), with seasonal high densities in spring and summer, and a lowering tendency in abundance from the coastal to the open marine systems, and from the surface to the depth waters, likely in relation to temperature and the organic matter load. it was recently shown that lytic infection, rather than induction of lysogeny, is responsible for the majority of bacteriophage production in the plankton, especially in the coastal marine and surface waters and during blooming events, where the threshold-product level of virus x bacteria numbers of greater than or equal to 10(12) for the start of a viral-lytic activity is generally achieved. Closed linear relationships have been reported between viroplankton dynamics and bacteria, algae and nutrients. Because of the preponderance of allochtonous organic matter and cyanobacterial cells in lakes as compared to oceanic systems, the virus-to-bacteria ratio in lakes are significantly higher than in marines systems, although there is little trend in the virus-to-bacteria ratio with increasing trophy, and despite the occurrence of more bacteria per unit chlorophyll in lake samples. The functional impact of virions on the structure and metabolism of planktonic communities is more important than their quantitative importance, as viruses represent only a minor fraction of the total planktonic biomass. The viral-induced mortality of microbial communities in marine systems is estimated to represent about 30 and < 10 pour 100 of the mortality of bacterio- and phytoplankton, respectively. Based on one study, the contribution of viruses to bacterial mortality in lakes seems considerably lower than in marine systems. The greatest impact of viruses on aquatic communities is likely through hazardous (i.e. non-steady state) processes which are difficult to quantified, such as the promotion of genetic material exchanges among populations and the maintenance of species diversity. The lytic pressure from virulent viruses may act as a ''nonstop'' inductor of modifications in the genetic heritage of host-organisms, thereby increasing the potential of these hosts to share their habitat with homologous species, i.e. with similar nutritional requirements. It has recently been shown that lysates resulting from phage infection can caused a significant increase in metabolic activity of noninfected bacterioplankton community, but the growth efficiency of these noninfected hosts decreased in the presence of viruses, likely because of the increase in bacterial energy demand associated with extracellular degradation of polymers that are prevalent in viral lysates. This seems to verify the hypothesis on a substantial contribution of the lytic activity from viruses, to the cycling of organic matter in aquatic systems. Viral lytic production may indeed (1) reduce the bacterial biomass contribution to the transfer of metabolic energy on to higher-order consumers, (2) result in an increase of bacterial secondary production in the absence of an increase in the ambient primary production, and (3) increase competition between bacterial exo- or ectoenzyme activity and the feeding activity of protozoa on high molecular weight polymers (including viruses), although ingestion of viruses by protists seems to be of less importance in the carbon flows through the microbial food web in pelagic systems. However, almost all studies on the ecology of pelagic viruses are done during a limited period of year, mainly in marine waters situated in temperate zones. The data discussed in this paper are thus to be considered as preliminary data. Nevertheless, viruses undoubtedly influence to various degrees the biological processes in aquatic ecosystems. The quantitative assessment of their functional impact is thus required for incorporation into models that simulate flues of matter, nutrients and energy in aquatic systems. This task is to be include on the agenda of both marine and freshwater biologists, as a high priority concern for the near future.

Comparative thermal biology and depth distribution of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and northern pike (Esox lucius) in an urban harbour of the Laurentian Great Lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Understanding how individuals are distributed in space and time, as well as how they interact with dynamic environmental conditions, represent fundamental knowledge gaps for many fish species. Using acoustic telemetry tags, we monitored the temperatures and depths used by northern pike (Esox lucius L., 1758) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides (Lacepede, 1802)) in Toronto Harbour (Lake Ontario). Northern pike and largemouth bass had similar thermal experiences throughout the year, except during summer, when northern pike were observed in cooler waters than largemouth bass. Both species used different depths throughout the year, with northern pike occupying deeper depths. Statistical modelling indicated that depth usage was influenced by all variables (season, species, and body size) and interactions between them, whereas thermal preferences were influenced by the main effects and interactions between species: season and species : body size. Both species were observed at temperatures warmer than those in the vicinity of nearby telemetry stations, but as station temperatures exceeded 20 degrees C, northern pike moved into cooler water, indicating active thermoregulation. These data will be useful for refining our understanding of the spatial ecology of fish and for informing fisheries and habitat management in this and other urban harbours of the Laurentian Great Lakes.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Gutowsky, Lee/0000-0003-1244-9465; wells, mathew/0000-0003-3838-9202; Hlevca, Bogdan/0000-0001-6636-4139; Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; 													0008-4301	1480-3283				NOV	2016	94	11					767	776		10.1139/cjz-2016-0053	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2016-0053													WOS:000387781400005

In North America, the invasive predatory cladoceran Cercopagis pengoi was first detected in Lake Ontario. We explored the impact of Cercopagis on the lower food web of Lake Ontario through assessments of historical and seasonal abundance of the crustacean zooplankton, by conducting feeding experiments on the dominant prey of the invader, and by estimating its food requirements. 2. Between 1999 and 2001, a decrease in the abundance of dominant members of the Lake Ontario zooplankton community (Daphnia retrocurva, Bosmina longirostris and Diacyclops thomasi) coincided with an increase in the abundance of Cercopagis. Daphnia retrocurva populations declined despite high fecundity in all 3 years, indicating that food limitation was not responsible. Chlorophyll a concentration generally increased, concomitant with a decline in the herbivorous cladoceran zooplankton in the lake. 3. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that Cercopagis fed on small-bodied species including D. retrocurva and B. longirostris. 4. Consumption demand of mid-summer populations of Cercopagis, estimated from a bioenergetic model of the confamilial Bythotrephes, was sufficient to reduce crustacean abundance, although the degree of expected suppression varied seasonally and interannually. 5. Predatory effects exerted by Cercopagis on the Lake Ontario zooplankton, while initially very pronounced, have decreased steadily as the species became established in the lake.

Here, we report a comprehensive petrographic and isotopic characterization of the carbonaceous chondrite Tarda, a recent fall recovered in the Moroccan Sahara. We show that Tarda shares strong similarities with the D-type-derived chondrite Tagish Lake, implying that Tarda represents a rare sample of D-type asteroids. Both Tarda and Tagish Lake are characterized by the presence of rare O-16-rich chondrules and chondrule fragments, high C/H ratios, and enrichments in deuterium, N-15, and C-13. By combining our results with literature data on carbonaceous chondrites related to C-type asteroids, we show that the outer solar system 4.56 Gy ago was characterized by large-scale oxygen isotopic homogeneities in (i) the water-ice grains accreted by asteroids and (ii) the gas controlling the formation of FeO-poor chondrules. Conversely, the zone in which D-type asteroids accreted was significantly enriched in deuterium relative to the formation regions of C-type asteroids, features likely inherited from unprocessed, D-rich, molecular-cloud materials.

However, winter tourism activities are one of the key components for supporting economic development in the highlands. Establishing a ski resort area supports direct and indirect employment in a region, and it stops immigration from mountainous regions to other places. This research aimed to assess the potential ski areas using a multi criteria evaluation technique in the Van region which is located in the eastern part of T & uuml;rkiye. In this context, snow cover duration, sun effect, slope, slope length, elevation, population density, distance from main roads and lake visibility were used as input factors in the decision making process. Each factor was standardized using a fuzzy technique based on existing well-known ski centers in T & uuml;rkiye. The weight of inputs was defined by applying a survey to the professional skiers. The most important factors were detected as transportation opportunities and snow covers whereas, the least important factors were elevation and population density. Additionally, lake visibility was very important to make a difference from other existing facilities in the region. Therefore, it was included as constraints and lake visible areas were extracted at the final stage of the research. Potential ski areas were mapped in three levels as professional, intermediate and beginner skiers. One of the suitable areas was selected as a sample projection and for the 3D simulation of the ski investment area. Potential costs and benefits were discussed. It was found that a ski tourism area investment can be amortized in 3 years in the region.

Winter diets of round whitefish Prosopium cylindraceum in the St. Marys River	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The round whitefish (Prosopium cylindraceum) is a coregonine native to numerous northern temperate lentic and lotic systems across North America. The St. Marys River, located between the United States and Canadian border, is one such system where the round whitefish supports a recreational fishery and is a prey source for piscivores. Round whitefish are generally known to prey upon benthic macroinvertebrates, but diets of round whitefish in the St. Marys River have not been characterized. We analyzed stomach contents from 107 round whitefish sampled from the St. Marys River during the winter months of 2020 and 2021 to describe their diets, examine their feeding strategies, and determine if they fed selectively. Ephemeropterans were the most important prey numerically, followed by megalopterans, trichopterans, and dipterans. The round whitefish population sampled from the St. Marys River exhibited a specialized feeding strategy that most often specialized on ephemeropterans. Patterns in the importance of prey types and feeding strategy were consistent between both years sampled. Selective feeding by round whitefish was examined using diet and environmental data from 2021 only, and we found that round whitefish selected both ephemeropterans and megalopterans, but avoided trichopterans and dipterans. Rather than being opportunistic invertivores, our results indicate round whitefish are specialized and selective feeders. Our findings can be used to inform conservation and management of round whitefish, as diets represent an integration of multiple ecological components such as prey availability, predator behavior, and habitat quality.

J	Henderson, KA; Murdock, JN; Lizotte, RE 				Henderson, Kate A.; Murdock, Justin N.; Lizotte, Richard E., Jr.			Water depth influences algal distribution and productivity in shallow agricultural lakes	ECOHYDROLOGY												Agricultural activity can alter water quality and quantity resulting in lakes facing increasing interactive stressors including eutrophication, suspended sediment and water withdrawal. This study examined the relationships between water depth, water quality and algae in shallow agricultural lakes in the lower Mississippi River Basin (LMRB) to assess how lake depth influences algal structure and function, focusing on factors that typically regulate growth, that is, light, temperature and nutrients. Lake water and sediment cores were collected in shallow (mean = 0.8 m) and deep (mean = 1.7 m) locations in three lakes seasonally for 1 year. Additionally, interactive effects of light and temperature on algal growth were investigated through a laboratory experiment to determine the relative importance of each in regulating algal biomass and net oxygen production. In these shallow, turbid, eutrophic lakes, deeper water had lower nutrient concentrations and temperature across all seasons and clearer water in the summer. Shallow areas had more phytoplankton and periphyton. Water temperature had a stronger correlation than light with both phytoplankton and periphyton biomass. Algal biomass generally decreased with increasing water temperature, but biomass was better predicted by increasing nitrogen availability, and productivity declined with greater phosphorus availability. Water depth was therefore likely influencing different locations of the same lake towards different algal stable states. Mitigating excess algal production is an important goal towards limiting hypoxic conditions in the LMRB, and increasing water storage could help moderate temperature, nutrients and turbidity effects that contribute to algal blooms in lakes receiving agricultural runoff.

Both water and sediment samples were collected on a biweekly interval from five sampling locations for a period of 8 months from May to December 2010. In addition, bacterial indicators of the water quality was monitored by enumerating the total coliform and fecal coliform (Escherichia coli) in the water and sediment samples from these sampling locations. The results showed the occurrence of caffeine in all samples collected throughout the study period indicating the presence of human domestic waste in these locations. The coliforms and caffeine in water were negatively correlated while a positive correlation was obtained between these parameters in sediment samples. The study showed a statistically significant variation in caffeine between the sampling locations over the study period with the maximum value recorded at Site 2, the most anthropogenically disturbed area. The seasonal variation of caffeine concentration showed higher values in summer months compared to others and this corresponded to the increased human activities in this area during this period. To conclude, monitoring of caffeine coupled with the bacterial indicators could help to track the origin of contaminants in the inland water systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Specimens from four fish species were collected during this study over a 14-month period from the Padda Dam, Johannesburg, transported to the laboratory and killed. Following examination, only Pp. philander was found to be infected with C. philander indicating strict host specificity Parasite intensity varied from 0 to 184 specimens per fish. Although no significant correlation between season and the infection of specimens of C. philander occurred, a maximum mean intensity of 91.6 occurred in winter. The prevalence was 100% in 10 of the 14 surveys, with no preference for host sex. Mean intensity of infection correlated positively with total length of the host and more parasites were present on fish with a higher condition factor. The distribution on the gill arches shows no significant difference between the number of parasites from gill arches on the left and right sides of fish. More parasites were present on the third and second gill arches, with the majority dorsally, on the distal ends. Water quality variables showed no correlation between prevalence, abundance or mean intensity of this parasite.

Therefore, a record combining a reliable chronology with unambiguous lake level indicators is essential to resolve the issue. In this study, we established a temporal sequence of well-preserved paleolake shorelines at different elevations around Dali Lake using quartz optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating. Combining the new OSL-based chronological data with the previously published ages of beach ridges, we constructed an integrated lake level record for Dali Lake since the last deglaciation; the record is chronologically well-constrained and provides a clearer representation of lake level changes than previous studies. The main findings are as follows: (1) the level of Dali Lake rose gradually during 14.5-8.0 ka and reached a highest level during 8.0-6.0 ka that was similar to 61 m higher than today, before gradually declining after similar to 6.0 ka; (2) although the short-lived highstand of Dali Lake during the early Holocene was caused by both monsoon precipitation and snow/ice meltwater influx, the mid-Holocene lake level maximum was mainly the result of increased monsoon precipitation. These findings indicate that the EASM maximum in the region occurred during the mid-Holocene, which is supported by precipitation-proxy records from the EASM margin; (3) a major decline (similar to 30 m) of the level of Dali Lake occurred at similar to 4.2 ka, reflecting a regional-scale drought event in northern China. Combined with near-contemporaneous frequent floods in the lower Yellow River, we propose that the pattern of "drought in northern China, flooding in central China" occurred during similar to 4.2-3.8 ka, triggering the migration of the prehistoric human population of the area to the central Plain of China. This population migration may have destabilized the existing social order and promoted the emergence of more complex societies, leading to the development of early civilization in north-central China.

J	Umaña, G				Umana, Gerardo, V			One year weekly dynamics of limnological conditions and phytoplankton in Lake Bonilla, Costa Rica	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												The detailed response of tropical lake phytoplankton to weather variations has been little studied, but it seems that composition varies in response to rain and wind variability over the course of the year. In order to gather more evidence on this variation, the weekly variability of phytoplankton composition was studied in Lake Bonilla, a low land (380 mast) 30 m deep tropical lake, from April 2010 to May 2011. Temperature variation at several depths was recorded automatically, and measurements of dissolved oxygen, water transparency, and nutrients were performed several times during the study period. The lake showed a warm monomictic pattern, with deep mixing occurring during the hemispherical winter, especially after a heavy rain period in December 2010. Phytoplankton was dominated by a few species: a colonial Cyanobacteria (Aphanocapsa sp., functional group F) and two colonial Chlorococcaceae (Botryococcus braunii and Eutetramorus tetrasporus, both in the functional group K). Their relative dominance shifted throughout the year, following changes in water column conditions in response to weather variations. Although changes in main functional groups indicate a shift in resource availability rather than energy, it was clear that attention should also be given to particular species adaptations beyond those used for establishing functional groups.

Forty-nine species belonging to 18 genera and 14 families were recorded. The highest densities of rotifer were observed during summer when there were heavy cyanobacterial blooms. There was a significant positive correlation between total rotifer density and the biomass of cyanobacteria. However, no correlations were found between the densities of rotifer and crustacean zooplankton, possibly owing to the paucity of large-bodied planktonic crustaceans. It is likely that the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms not only caused the shift of dominant crustacean zooplankton from large species to smaller ones but also weakened the negative interaction between crustaceans and rotifers.

Modern to millennium-old greenhouse gases emitted from ponds and lakes of the Eastern Canadian Arctic (Bylot Island, Nunavut)	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Ponds and lakes are widespread across the rapidly changing permafrost environments. Aquatic systems play an important role in global biogeochemical cycles, especially in greenhouse gas (GHG) exchanges between terrestrial systems and the atmosphere. The source, speciation and emission rate of carbon released from permafrost landscapes are strongly influenced by local conditions, hindering pan-Arctic generalizations. This study reports on GHG ages and emission rates from aquatic systems located on Bylot Island, in the continuous permafrost zone of the Eastern Canadian Arctic. Dissolved and ebullition gas samples were collected during the summer season from different types of water bodies located in a highly dynamic periglacial valley: polygonal ponds, collapsed ice-wedge trough ponds, and larger lakes. The results showed strikingly different ages and fluxes depending on aquatic system types. Polygonal ponds were net sinks of dissolved CO2, but variable sources of dissolved CH4. They presented the highest ebullition fluxes, 1 or 2 orders of magnitude higher than from other ponds and lakes. Trough ponds appeared as substantial GHG sources, especially when their edges were actively eroding. Both types of ponds produced modern to hundreds of years old (<550 yr BP) GHG, even if trough ponds could contain much older carbon (>2000 yr BP) derived from freshly eroded peat. Lakes had small dissolved and ebullition fluxes, however they released much older GHG, including millennium-old CH4 (up to 3500 yr BP) from lake central areas. Acetoclastic methanogenesis dominated at all study sites and there was minimal, if any, methane oxidation in gas emitted through ebullition. These findings provide new insights on GHG emissions by permafrost aquatic systems and their potential positive feedback effect on climate.					; Fortier, Daniel/E-6965-2016	Bouchard, Frederic/0000-0001-9687-3356; Preskienis, Vilmantas/0000-0002-8176-2263; Laurion, Isabelle/0000-0001-8694-3330; Fortier, Daniel/0000-0003-0908-6157													1726-4170	1726-4189					2015	12	23					7279	7298		10.5194/bg-12-7279-2015	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-12-7279-2015													WOS:000372085100009

Identification and quantification of phytoplankton groups in lakes using new pigment ratios -: a comparison between pigment analysis by HPLC and microscopy	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Pigment analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) combined with data analysis using the CHEMTAX program has proven to be a fast and precise method for determining the abundance of phytoplankton groups in marine environments. To determine whether CHEMTAX is applicable also to freshwater phytoplankton, 20 different species of freshwater algae were cultured and their pigment/chlorophyll a (Ch1 a) ratios determined for exponential growth at three different light intensities and for stationary growth at one light intensity. 2. The different treatments had a relatively insignificant impact on the absolute values of the diagnostic pigment/Ch1 a ratios, with the exception of cyanobacteria and cryptophytes for which the zeaxanthin/Ch1 a and alloxanthin/Ch1 a ratios varied considerably. 3. The pigment ratios were tested on samples collected in six different eutrophic Danish lakes during two summer periods using the CHEMTAX program to calculate the biomass of the phytoplankton groups as Ch1 a. The CHEMTAX-derived seasonal changes in Ch1 a biomass corresponded well with the volume of the microscopically determined phytoplankton groups. More phytoplankton groups were detected by the pigment method than by the microscopic method. 4. Applying the pigment ratios developed in this study, the pigment method can be used to determine the abundance of the individual phytoplankton groups, which are useful as biological water quality indicators when determining the ecological status of freshwater lakes.					; Lauridsen, Torben/JAX-3118-2023	Lauridsen, Torben/0000-0003-0139-2395; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	2006	51	8					1474	1485		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01582.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01582.x													WOS:000239600400007

Field experiments were performed in which phytoplankton were exposed to different densities of two major types of herbivorous zooplankton, cladocerans and copepods. Contrary to expectation, neither of the two zooplankton groups significantly reduced phytoplankton biomass. However, there were strong and contrasting impacts on phytoplankton size structure and on individual taxa. Cladocerans suppressed small phytoplankton, while copepods suppressed large phytoplankton. The unaffected size classes compensated for the loss of those affected by enhanced growth. After contamination of the copepod mesocosms with the cladoceran Daphnia, the combined impact of both zooplankton groups caused a decline in total phytoplankton biomass.

Phytoplankton dynamics, food chain changes and resilience in Lake Zwemlust, a shallow lake in The Netherlands, are described for the period 1986-94. 2. After biomanipulation in 1987, the lake moved through two alternative states, while the external nutrient loadings were maintained. A clear-water phase, mostly dominated by macrophytes, persisted from 1987 to 1991, and a rather turbid state, dominated by algae, occurred in the summers of 1992-94, after several consecutive and sustained perturbations affecting different parts of the food web in the lake. These two periods were characterized by different community structures. 3. The phytoplankton assemblage gradually changed in a pattern that reverted in later years towards that of the pre-biomanipulation stage, although the same species composition was not regained. This agrees with some mathematical models. During the clear-water phase, nutrient shortage, light climate and zooplankton feeding selected in favour of small, high surface :volume ratio and rapidly reproducing algae. However, in mid-summer of 1992-94, nutrient availability and cladoceran grazing on edible algae favoured cyanophyte. 4. Nutrients were transferred to higher trophic levels or lost from the system at relatively high rates when the lake was in a piscivore-macrophyte-dominated state, while they tended to accumulate in the algae in a planktivore-dominated chain without macrophytes. The role of weed beds was central for nutrient competition (mostly nitrogen) with algae, as well as a refuge and a base for alternative food sources to grazers. Weed beds seemed to have a strong effect in increasing connectedness, resilience and stability of the lake community. 5. The complete return of Zwemlust to a turbid state dominated by phytoplankton seems to have depended upon turnover of the limiting nutrient, which was retarded by macrophytes and stimulated by planktivorous fish and waterfowl.					van Donk, Ellen/B-7272-2008	van Donk, Ellen/0000-0003-3279-4936													0046-5070					DEC	1996	36	3					683	696		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.d01-511.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.d01-511.x													WOS:A1996WA16200018
J	BUSER, HR				BUSER, HR			ATRAZINE AND OTHER S-TRIAZINE HERBICIDES IN LAKES AND IN RAIN IN SWITZERLAND	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												All of the 18 Swiss lakes analyzed contained detectable quantities of some s-triazine herbicides. Atrazine was the major herbicide present, accompanied by smaller amounts of simazine, terbuthylazine, and occasionally (methylthio)-s-triazines. The concentration of atrazine was lowest (1 ng/L or less) in moutain lakes (altitude > 800 msl) and highest (up to 460 ng/L) in lakes situated in areas with intensive use of atrazine. Seasonal trends were observed, with a concentration increase in the epilimnia around June, apparently resulting from previous spring applications of the herbicides. Vertical concentration profiles of the herbicides in Lake Zurich were consistent with stratification of the lake during the warmer season and mixing in the colder one. The data suggest atrazine to be rather stable and its removal from the lakes is mainly by export via outflowing waters and less by degradation. Atrazine and other s-triazines were also detected in rainwater during the warmer season. Volatilization and wind erosion of soil particles from areas treated with these herbicides are likely the cause for the presence of these compounds in rain and aerial transport and subsequent deposition the reasons that we find these compounds in mountain lakes. However, major input of these herbicides in most other lakes stems from agricultural practices and nonagricultural uses along roads and railroads.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				JUL	1990	24	7					1049	1058		10.1021/es00077a016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00077a016													WOS:A1990DL43400021
J	Fukumura, Y				Fukumura, Yoshimi			From Local Memories to Living Heritage: The Japanese Ice Tradition 'Omiwatari' Adapting to Changing Climate	ANTHROPOLOGICAL FORUM												This study examines the resilience and adaptive capacity of the omiwatari ice tradition in Nagano, Japan, and its associated archival record, the Miwatari-ch & ocirc;, in the context of climate change. During harsh winters, Lake Suwa forms huge ice ridges that ancient inhabitants believed to be the footsteps of a local deity, prompting the local Shinto shrine to celebrate the occurrence. The shrine's parishioners or ujiko have recorded the occurrence in the Miwatari-ch & ocirc; for over five centuries. In modern society, the omiwatari ice phenomenon continues to foster a sense of place and identity in the Suwa region. However, warming winters have prevented the phenomenon from occurring as frequently. Through a content analysis of the Miwatari-ch & ocirc; historical archives of ice observation and an ethnographic study of the Yatsurugi Shrine community, this paper examines how the function of the omiwatari tradition has evolved. The findings reveal that the Miwatari-ch & ocirc; has transitioned from a tool to transmit environmental risk information to the next generation, to a repository of local cultural memory. Applying the cultural memory theory, the study discusses the processes of identity formation, reconstruction, and institutionalization that underpin the preservation of the omiwatari tradition. This occurs despite the diminishing physical symbol of the tradition - ice ridges - which are maintained in the Miwatari-ch & ocirc;. The study highlights the Yatsurugi Shrine community's capacity for transformative adaptation of the omiwatari tradition, integrating ancestral memory with the responsibility of the community representatives to ensure the continuity of this culturally significant tradition in the face of climate change.						, Yoshimi/0000-0001-8804-6721													0066-4677	1469-2902				JAN 2	2025	35	1					1	23		10.1080/00664677.2025.2481850	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00664677.2025.2481850		MAR 2025											WOS:001457199500001
J	WARREN, JK				WARREN, JK			THE HYDROLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF HOLOCENE TEPEES, STROMATOLITES, AND BOXWORK LIMESTONES IN COASTAL SALINAS IN SOUTH-AUSTRALIA	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY PETROLOGY												Holocene groundwater lakes (salinas) are common in the coastal zone of South Australia. They usually contain an evaporitic carbonate sequence that surrounds a central gypsum unit to form a bull''s-eye pattern of sediment distribution in the salina. The evaporitic carbonates can be subdivided into 3 units: a boxwork boundstone unit, a veneer boundstone unit and an algal boundstone unit. These units contain many interesting structures including tepees, stromatolites, and mound springs, all of which show a megapolygonal outcrop pattern. The salina carbonates have formed under a hydrological regime that has changed little since its inception some 6000 yr ago. Consequently it has been possible to interpret the hydrological significance of the salina carbonates. The salinas are filled by schizohaline surface waters whose water levels and salinities fluctuate seasonally. All of the salina carbonates form where marine-derived groundwater resurges from a surrounding dune aquifer into the margin of the salina. Tepee structures form in the veneer boundstone as a response to groundwater-induced seasonal changes in the pore pressures of the underlying boxwork sediments. The recognition of such groundwater tepees of other groundwater-controlled structures in ancient carbonate sequences could aid paleohydrological interpretation of the ancient basin.																			0022-4472						1982	52	4					1171	1201																WOS:A1982PX41300009

A sharp chemical gradient was observed in the lower waters throughout the study, supporting the classification of the lake as meromictic. An isodensity plot is presented for the study period. Densities were estimated with an equation of state obtained from the literature, which incorporated depth, temperature and specific conductance information. Temporal variations in total stability are depicted, which were mitigated by seasonal thermal stratification. The chemical stability component remained constant (closed system value of 32.4 g-cm cm-2), and contributed only 5.7% to the total, for the maximum stability case. The work of wind in distributing the summer heat income (8570 g-cal cm-2) was 348 g-cm cm-2. Based on the identity of the chemically enriched forms within the chemocline/monimolimnion the low magnitude of the chemical stability, the large seasonal contribution of thermal stability to total stability, and the lake settling, the lake could be an example of biogenic meromixis.																			0270-5060	2156-6941					1981	1	2					129	139		10.1080/02705060.1981.9664025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1981.9664025													WOS:A1981MQ05000001

Composition, seasonal change, and bathymetry of Ligeia Mare, Titan, derived from its microwave thermal emission	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												For the last decade, the passive radiometer incorporated in the Cassini RADAR has recorded the 2.2cm wavelength thermal emission from Titan's seas. In this paper, we analyze the radiometry observations collected from February 2007 to January 2015 over one of these seas, Ligeia Mare, with the goal of providing constraints on its composition, bathymetry, and dynamics. In light of the depth profile obtained by Mastrogiuseppe et al. (2014) and of a two-layer model, we find that the dielectric constant of the sea liquid is <1.8, and its loss tangent is 3.6-2.1+4.3x10-5. Both results point to a composition dominated by liquid methane rather than ethane. A high methane concentration suggests that Ligeia Mare is primarily fed by methane-rich precipitation and/or ethane has been removed from it (e.g., by crustal interaction). Our result on the dielectric constant of the seafloor is less constraining <mml:mfenced open=2.9-0.9+0.9, but we favor a scenario where the floor of Ligeia Mare is covered by a sludge of compacted and possibly nitrile-rich organic material formed by the deposition of photochemical haze or by rain washing of the nearby shores. We use these results to produce a low-resolution bathymetry map of the sea. We also estimate the temperature variation of the bulk sea between February 2007 and July 2013 to be <2K, which provides a constraint on its net evaporative cooling currently being explored in ocean circulation models. Lastly, we suggest a lag in the summer warming of the northern polar terrains.

J	Calamita, E; Piccolroaz, S; Majone, B; Toffolon, M				Calamita, Elisa; Piccolroaz, Sebastiano; Majone, Bruno; Toffolon, Marco			On the role of local depth and latitude on surface warming heterogeneity in the Laurentian Great Lakes	INLAND WATERS												Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) responds rapidly to changes in climatic variables. This response is heterogeneous in space and its spatial distribution is primarily influenced by lake bathymetry and latitude. Such heterogeneity is not captured by one-dimensional water temperature models, which can accurately predict only the average LSWT. We performed a spatially distributed application of the hybrid physically based/data-driven model air2water to predict the LSWT variability in the 5 Laurentian Great Lakes and to deepen our understanding of the role of local depth and latitude in shaping this heterogeneous response. Daily remotely sensed LSWT data were used to calibrate and validate the model during 1995-2018, and additional simulations considering a synthetic warmer climate scenario in which air temperature was increased by 2 degrees C were run to assess the inter- and intra-lake differences in LSWT warming rates. The model reproduces the observed spatial distribution of LSWT with an average root mean squared error of 1.2 degrees C and suggests that, under the warmer scenario, the LSWT of the 5 lakes could increase heterogeneously, with the deepest zones showing the maximum warming rates. Summer stratification lengthening is expected to increase with higher local depth; this behaviour attenuates with increasing latitude, whereas the LSWT warming is essentially dependent on the local depth, irrespective of latitude. We highlight the importance of accounting for LSWT spatial heterogeneity to adequately assess the thermal response of the Great Lakes to a warming climate.					; Toffolon, Marco/D-4845-2011; Piccolroaz, Sebastiano/AAJ-7627-2021; Majone, Bruno/M-2126-2016	Piccolroaz, Sebastiano/0000-0003-1796-7624; Calamita, Elisa/0000-0002-2614-2942; Toffolon, Marco/0000-0001-6825-7070; Majone, Bruno/0000-0003-3471-7408													2044-2041	2044-205X				APR 3	2021	11	2					208	222		10.1080/20442041.2021.1873698	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2021.1873698		APR 2021											WOS:000635396300001

The species is of particular conservation interest, since it has limited thermal tolerance, low dispersal capacity and is represented by a single population with a very restricted range. The anthropogenic pressure linked to summer tourism and the habitat's vulnerability to climate change represent the main threats to the species. Concern over the population's persistence has been increased by a period of total drying of the lake in summer 2017, which was attributed to earthquakes that occurred in 2016 and were judged to have altered the hydrogeological conditions. Our study aims were to: i) evaluate the conservation status of C. marchesonii and its habitat; ii) examine the influence of enviromnental parameters on the zooplankton community, with special reference to C. marchesonii population densities; and iii) provide information to underpin effective conservation strategies. The zooplankton community was monitored monthly from July to November 2018 and from June to August 2019, using a Runner bottle and an 80-mu m mesh net within transects of known length. On each sampling occasion, 13 physicochemical parameters were measured, and water-level fluctuations and lake surface area were recorded. Higher air temperatures seem to be a key driver of drying events, whereas we identified no significant differences in water physicochemistry compared to the past. The mean estimated population density of C. marchesonii (0.06 individuals L-1) showed that, despite the 2017 drying event, the species completed its life cycle during the study period, although its population densities were lower than previously recorded. Our results can inform extinction risk assessment and associated management strategies, such as the identification of alternative habitats with the potential to support C. marchesonii populations.					lorenzoni, massimo/G-7610-2014; Carosi, Antonella/AAE-4635-2020; federico, morandi/OEP-3336-2025														1863-9135					JAN	2021	194	3					171	185		10.1127/fal/2020/1292	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/fal/2020/1292													WOS:000609259000003

The isotopic analyses described in this paper allowed for identification of sources of the dissolved sulphates in the waters of two representative lakes. One of the sources of sulphur isotopes may be oxidation of sulphides (supplied in debris sliding from the slopes of waste dumps that surround the lakes) in the water column. The fraction of oxygen from water in forming the sulphates varies from about 5 to 25% in the first lake, while in the second it falls within the range 25-85%. The main source of sulphates in the lakes is the oxidation of pyrite.

Particle size distribution and composition in a mechanically ventilated school building during air pollution episodes	INDOOR AIR					Indoor Air 2008 Conference	AUG 17-22, 2008	Copenhagen, DENMARK					Particle count-based size distribution and PM2.5 mass were monitored inside and outside an elementary school in Salt Lake City (UT, USA) during the winter atmospheric inversion season. The site is influenced by urban traffic and the airshed is subject to periods of high PM2.5 concentration that is mainly submicron ammonium and nitrate. The school building has mechanical ventilation with filtration and variable-volume makeup air. Comparison of the indoor and outdoor particle size distribution on the five cleanest and five most polluted school days during the study showed that the ambient submicron particulate matter (PM) penetrated the building, but indoor concentrations were about one-eighth of outdoor levels. The indoor:outdoor PM2.5 mass ratio averaged 0.12 and particle number ratio for sizes smaller than 1 mu m averaged 0.13. The indoor submicron particle count and indoor PM2.5 mass increased slightly during pollution episodes but remained well below outdoor levels. When the building was occupied the indoor coarse particle count was much higher than ambient levels. These results contribute to understanding the relationship between ambient monitoring station data and the actual human exposure inside institutional buildings. The study confirms that staying inside a mechanically ventilated building reduces exposure to outdoor submicron particles.																			0905-6947	1600-0668				OCT	2008	18	5					386	393		10.1111/j.1600-0668.2008.00539.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0668.2008.00539.x								18647192					WOS:000259236800005

This study quantitatively estimates the change in lake surface area since the 1970s and investigates how this change can affect local and regional near-surface air temperatures during the summer. LANDSAT satellite imagery shows more than 80% reduction in lake surface area since the 1970s. Simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model show that this change in the lake surface can lead to a statistically significant warming of more than 6 degrees C in 2 m air temperatures over the dry lake bed and a significant warming signal of up to 1 degrees C covering an area up to 200 km around the original lake boundary, especially to the south. Observations in this region are sparse but still warming trends consistent with the simulations are seen in 2 m air temperatures from the Global Historical Climatology Network dataset. Atmospheric reanalysis and land cover data suggest that large-scale climate variability and land use change in the Amu Darya and Syr Darya basins contribute to the regional warming trends. Improvements in data and modeling capability are required to study the effects on diurnal and seasonal temperature cycle. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Winter lake salinities approximate freshwater lake values, but during periods when the lake is dry, capillary rise of groundwater is thought to increase surface soil salinity. An undescribed species of Melaleuca and Casuarina obesa dominated the seasonally inundated regions of the lake bed. Aeolian deposits of higher elevation were dominated by Eucalyptus loxophleba, Allocasuarina huegeliana or species of Banksia. Woodland of E. oleosa var. longicornis and E. salmonophloia occurred predominantly on upland fluviatile deposits of sand and sandy clays. Measurements of soil salinity and the calculation of percentage inundation from tree elevations and observations of tree vigor and xylem pressure potential response indicated that tree deaths in Melaleuca sp. and C. obesa were due to increased levels of salinity. Deaths and low vigors in E. rudis were attributed to both increasing salinities and prolonged inundation. We believe control of ground water levels should be a major consideration in the preservation of this ephemeral lake and the water fowl populations it supports.

J	Groeger, AW; Bass, DA				Groeger, AW; Bass, DA			Empirical predictions of water temperatures in a subtropical reservoir	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												A series of empirically-derived equations were developed from data spanning the 32 year history (1969-2000) that predict or reconstruct water temperatures of the inflowing river, the near surface or epilimnion, and the deep and outflowing waters of subtropical Canyon Reservoir on the Guadalupe River in southcentral Texas, USA. Inflowing and near surface water temperatures both can be predicted from local air temperatures. We used a 5 day or I day (in the case of high inflows associated with storm fronts) averaging period of air temperature for the river and a 30 day period for the reservoir surface water. Predictions of deep water and outflow temperatures were more complex in this bottom-draining reservoir. During the winter months, when the reservoir was nearest to being isothermal, air temperature was the primary factor used to predict deep temperatures. For the remainder of the year, the rate at which water was released from the reservoir tended to be the most important factor in predicting deep temperatures, although the air temperature of the previous winter could also be important. During drier years, the cold hypolinmetic waters are retained throughout the stratified period, and outflows were as cool as 12-13 degrees C in August and September. During very wet years the cold hypolinmetic waters are lost downstream early, and August and September outflows may be as warm as 23-24 degrees C. Therefore, interannual variation in the temperature of the hypolimnion and tailwaters is quite high. This represents a thermal stress to the local biota that is very different from the idea of "thermal constancy" commonly associated with other reservoir tailwater habitats. Because of this reservoir's particular sensitivity to variation in flow, projections of future change in runoff (as the climate changes) may have a greater effect on the thermal environment of this reservoir than will change in atmospheric temperature.																			0003-9136					FEB	2005	162	2					267	285		10.1127/0003-9136/2005/0162-0267	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2005/0162-0267													WOS:000227724500007
J	Graf, DL				Graf, DL			Northern redistribution of freshwater pearly mussels (Bivalvia: Unionoidea) during Wisconsin deglaciation in the southern Glacial Lake Agassiz region: A review	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												The chronology of the reinvasion of freshwater pearly mussels (Bivalvia: Unionoidea) into the southern Glacial Lake Agassiz region is reconstructed from the published record of the latest Pleistocene (Wisconsin) deglaciation of the region and known spatial and temporal distributions. The earliest invading unionoidean fauna entered the region above the driftless area of southeastern Minnesota and western Wisconsin between 14,000 and 11,000 years before present; the remaining species colonized the region postglacially. The formation of St. Anthony Falls is correlated with the drainage of Lake Agassiz from the Herman to the Campbell Beach level as an estimate of its date of formation, and a new chronology and mechanism of mussel dispersal into the Red River of the North basin is proposed.

As sediment is deposited, it provides a record of past climatic or environmental conditions. However, determining a direct relationship between specific climatic variables and measurable sediment properties, for instance between temperature and sediment optical reflectance, is complex. In this study, we investigate the suitability of sediment reflectance, recorded as sediment pixel intensity (PxI), as a paleoclimate proxy at a large ice-contact lake in southern Patagonia, Lago Argentino. We also evaluate whether sediment PxI can be used to investigate the present-day climatic drivers of sedimentation across Lago Argentino. First, we show that sediment PxIs relate to underlying sediment composition, and are significantly correlated with XRF-derived major element composition. Secondly, we find that PxIs correlate with both austral summer temperatures and wind speeds, but not with precipitation. PxI timeseries reach the p<0.1 correlation significance threshold for use as a paleo-wind proxy in as many as 6 cores and a paleo-temperature proxy in up to 4 cores. However, high spatial variability and the non-unique relationship between PxI and both temperature and wind speed challenges the necessary assumption of stationarity at Lago Argentino. While not suitable as a paleoclimatic proxy, correlations between PxI and instrumental climate data do chronicle current climatic controls on sediment deposition at Lago Argentino: high summer temperatures enhance settling of coarse, optically dark grains across the lake basin by promoting ice melt and lake stratification, while high wind speeds reduce the settling of fine, optically bright grains in the ice-proximal regions by transporting sediment-rich waters away from the glacier fronts. The assumptions required for quantitative paleoclimatic reconstruction must be carefully evaluated in complex lacustrine environments, but records unsuitable for use as proxies might nevertheless yield valuable information about the drivers of modern sedimentary transport and deposition.

For instance, long-term predictions of bathymetric change for modeling climate change scenarios require an objective calculation procedure of sediment load as a function of catchment characteristics and hydro-climatic parameters. Thus, the overarching objective of this study is to develop viable and objective sediment load assessment methods in data-sparse regions. Methods This study uses the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and the SEdiment Delivery Distributed (SEDD) model to predict soil erosion and sediment transport in data-sparse catchments. The novel algorithmic methods build on free datasets, such as satellite and reanalysis data. Novelty stems from the usage of freely available datasets and the introduction of a seasonal snow memory into the RUSLE. In particular, the methods account for non-erosive snowfall, its accumulation over months as a function of temperature, and erosive snowmelt months after the snow fell. Results Model accuracy parameters in the form of Pearson's r and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency indicate that data interpolation with climate reanalysis and satellite imagery enables viable sediment load predictions in data-sparse regions. The accuracy of the model chain further improves when snow memory is added to the RUSLE. Non-erosivity of snowfall makes the most significant increase in model accuracy. Conclusion The novel snow memory methods represent a major improvement for estimating suspended sediment loads with the empirical RUSLE. Thus, the influence of snow processes on soil erosion and sediment load should be considered in any analysis of mountainous catchments.

Modeling the mechanisms that control in-stream dissolved organic carbon dynamics in upland and forested catchments	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												[1] We present a new, process-based model of soil and stream water dissolved organic carbon (DOC): the Integrated Catchments Model for Carbon (INCA-C). INCA-C is the first model of DOC cycling to explicitly include effects of different land cover types, hydrological flow paths, in-soil carbon biogeochemistry, and surface water processes on in-stream DOC concentrations. It can be calibrated using only routinely available monitoring data. INCA-C simulates daily DOC concentrations over a period of years to decades. Sources, sinks, and transformation of solid and dissolved organic carbon in peat and forest soils, wetlands, and streams as well as organic carbon mineralization in stream waters are modeled. INCA-C is designed to be applied to natural and seminatural forested and peat-dominated catchments in boreal and temperate regions. Simulations at two forested catchments showed that seasonal and interannual patterns of DOC concentration could be modeled using climate-related parameters alone. A sensitivity analysis showed that model predictions were dependent on the mass of organic carbon in the soil and that in-soil process rates were dependent on soil moisture status. Sensitive rate coefficients in the model included those for organic carbon sorption and desorption and DOC mineralization in the soil. The model was also sensitive to the amount of litter fall. Our results show the importance of climate variability in controlling surface water DOC concentrations and suggest the need for further research on the mechanisms controlling production and consumption of DOC in soils.

Water samples were collected at these 15 beaches less than 24-h after a rainfall event of at least 6 mm. The effect of rainfall on bacterial concentrations along the Wisconsin shores of Lake Superior was investigated. Water samples were collected at a water depth of 24-30 inches as specified by the requirements of the WI BEACH Program. The Colisure(R) test was utilized for Escherichia coli (E. coli) and coliform determinations. No relationship between rainfall amount and bacterial concentrations at any of the 15 beaches tested was found. Although other researchers have observed a direct positive relationship between rainfall and E. coli levels in beach water, we found no significant relationship for Lake Superior beaches. This is an important finding given the fact that beach closures are often based upon rainfall alone, rather than on actual E. coli concentration measurements. This study reinforces the fact that the data obtained at one location should not necessarily be extrapolated to beach closure decisions at other locations.																			0920-4741	1573-1650				FEB	2006	20	1					151	159		10.1007/s11269-006-5528-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-006-5528-1													WOS:000235063400009

The geothermal water in Tibet is characterized by high boron content, but the water pollution caused by the discharge of this high boron geothermal water is not clear. In this study, we collected geothermal water and surface water from the Zhaxikang geothermal system in southern Tibet to investigate the causes of high boron geothermal water and the water pollution of water quality by its discharge. The results indicate that the hydrochemical type of geothermal water was HCO3-Cl-Na, while that of cold spring water, mine water, river water, and lake water was SO4-HCO3-Ca-Mg. Hydrogen and oxygen isotopes show that the recharge source of cold groundwater was mainly snow-melting water and meteoric water, while in addition to that, there is magmatic water for hot springs. The boron content of geothermal water in the study area is as high as 42.36 mg/L, far exceeding the World Health Organization limit for drinking water (0.5 mg/L). The analysis of ion components and PHREEQC modeling indicated that the dissolution of silicate minerals and cation exchange controlled the composition of groundwater, and the boron in groundwater mainly came from the volatilization of magmatic components and the leaching of shallow sediments. The entropy weight water quality index was used to evaluate the water quality of the study area; about 42.9% of the groundwater samples are of good quality and can be used for drinking, mainly cold water that has not been mixed with geothermal water in the upstream. With the discharge of geothermal water into the river (with a mix ratio of similar to 20%), the downstream water quality gradually deteriorated. The health risk assessment of drinking water in the study area showed that the hazard index (HI) of drinking water in the mixed area was higher than 1 (with an average of 1.594 for children and 1.366 for adults), indicating that children are at a higher health risk than adults. Geothermal water with high boron content has been found all over the world, and the adverse effects of its natural drainage cannot be ignored.					; Wang, Yingchun/N-1864-2018	Wang, Yingchun/0000-0001-8089-1920; li, liang/0000-0003-3402-4783; 														2073-4441				OCT	2022	14	20							3243	10.3390/w14203243	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14203243													WOS:000873433900001

However, current earth-system models, used for weather prediction and climate projection, are still in their infancy stage to consider irrigation effects. This study used long-term data collected from two contrasting (irrigated and rainfed) nearby maize-soybean rotation fields, to study the effects of irrigation memory on local hydroclimate. For a 12 year average, irrigation decreases summer surface-air temperature by less than 1 degrees C and increases surface humidity by 0.52 g kg(-1). The irrigation cooling effect is more pronounced and longer lasting for maize than for soybean. Irrigation reduces maximum, minimum, and averaged temperature over maize by more than 0.5 degrees C for the first six days after irrigation, but its temperature effect over soybean is mixed and negligible two or three days after irrigation. Irrigation increases near-surface humidity over maize by about 1 g kg(-1) up to ten days and increases surface humidity over soybean (similar to 0.8 g k(-1)) with a similar memory. These differing effects of irrigation memory on temperature and humidity are associated with respective changes in the surface sensible and latent heat fluxes formaize and soybean. These findings highlight great need and challenges for earth-system models to realistically simulate how irrigation effects vary with crop species and with crop growth stages, and to capture complex interactions between agricultural management and water-system components (crop transpiration, precipitation, river, reservoirs, lakes, groundwater, etc.) at various spatial and temporal scales.

J	Khalaf, EEAH				Khalaf, Ezz El Din Abdel Hakim			Variations in eruptive style and depositional processes of Neoproterozoic terrestrial volcano-sedimentary successions in the Hamid area, North Eastern Desert, Egypt	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												Two contrasting Neoproterozoic volcano-sedimentary successions of ca. 600 m thickness were recognized in the Hamid area, Northeastern Desert, Egypt. A lower Hamid succession consists of alluvial sediments, coherent lava flows, pyroclastic fall and flow deposits. An upper Hamid succession includes deposits from pyroclastic density currents, sills, and dykes. Sedimentological studies at different scales in the Hamid area show a very complex interaction of fluvial, eruptive, and gravitational processes in time and space and thus provided meaningful insights into the evolution of the rift sedimentary environments and the identification of different stages of effusive activity, explosive activity, and relative quiescence, determining syn-eruptive and inter-eruptive rock units. The volcano-sedimentary deposits of the study area can be ascribed to 14 fades and 7 fades associations: (1) basin-border alluvial fan, (2) mixed sandy fluvial braid plain, (3) bed-load-dominated ephemeral lake, (4) lava flows and volcaniclastics, (5) pyroclastic fall deposits, (6) phreatomagmatic volcanic deposits, and (7) pyroclastic density current deposits. These systems are in part coeval and in part succeed each other, forming five phases of basin evolution: (i) an opening phase including alluvial fan and valley flooding together with a lacustrine period, (ii) a phase of effusive and explosive volcanism (pulsatory phase), (iii) a phase of predominant explosive and deposition from base surges (collapsing phase), and (iv) a phase of caldera eruption and ignimbrite-forming processes (climactic phase). The fades architectures record a change in volcanic activity from mainly phreatomagmatic eruptions, producing large volumes of lava flows and pyroclastics (pulsatory and collapsing phase), to highly explosive, pumice-rich plinian-type pyroclastic density current deposits (climactic phase). Hamid area is a small-volume volcano, however, its magma compositions, eruption styles, and inter-eruptive breaks suggest, that it closely resembles a volcanic architecture commonly associated with large, composite volcanoes.

In addition, the scarcity and brevity of regional instrumental and palaeoecological records still hamper our understanding of past and present patterns of environmental change. To investigate how the remote, high-alpine environments of the Nianbaoyeze Mountains, eastern Tibetan Plateau, are affected by climate change and human activity over the last similar to 600 years, we compared regional tree-ring studies with pollen and diatom remains archived in the dated sediments of Dongerwuka Lake (33.22A degrees N, 101.12A degrees E, 4,307 m a.s.l.). In agreement with previous studies from the eastern Tibetan Plateau, a strong coherence between our two juniper-based tree-ring chronologies from the Nianbaoyeze and the Anemaqin Mountains was observed, with pronounced cyclical variations in summer temperature reconstructions. A positive directional trend to warmer summer temperatures in the most recent decades, was, however, not observed in the tree-ring record. Likewise, our pollen and diatom spectra showed minimal change over the investigated time period. Although modest, the most notable change in the diatom relative abundances was a subtle decrease in the dominant planktonic Cyclotella ocellata and a concurrent increase in small, benthic fragilarioid taxa in the similar to 1820s, suggesting higher ecosystem variability. The pollen record subtly indicates three periods of increased cattle grazing activity (similar to 1400-1480 AD, similar to 1630-1760 AD, after 1850 AD), but shows generally no significant vegetation changes during past similar to 600 years. The minimal changes observed in the tree-ring, diatom and pollen records are consistent with the presence of localised cooling centres that are evident in instrumental and tree-ring data within the southeastern and eastern Tibetan Plateau. Given the minor changes in regional temperature records, our complacent palaeoecological profiles suggest that climatically induced ecological thresholds have not yet been crossed in the Nianbaoyeze Mountains region.

We conducted such an evaluation of hypoxia models for the northern Gulf of Mexico and Chesapeake Bay using hindcasts of historical data, comparing several approaches to model calibration. For both systems we find that model sensitivity and precision can be optimized and model accuracy maintained within reasonable bounds by calibrating the model to relatively short, recent 3 year datasets. Model accuracy was higher for Chesapeake Bay than for the Gulf of Mexico, potentially indicating the greater importance of unmodeled processes in the latter system.

Dendrochronological potential of Salix alaxensis from the Kuujjua River area, western Canadian Arctic	TREE-RING RESEARCH												This study presents the first annually-resolved chronology using Salix alaxensis (Anderss.) Cov from Victoria Island, Northwest Territories, Canada, an area well north of treeline. Forty-one samples were collected and examined for subsequent analysis. However, crossclating was difficult because of locally absent or missing rings and the narrowness of the rings, and ultimately thirteen stems were crossdated and used to evaluate their dendroclimatological potential. The chronology spans 74 years (1927-2000) and could potentially be extended further using subfossil wood. Precipitation data from December of the previous year to March of the current year were the most consistently and highly correlated with ring width. This suggests that the recharge of the soil moisture by early summer snowmelt is a key factor limiting growth of these shrubs.

Here, we integrated 40 well-dated peat/lake sediment cores to reveal the peatlands evolution history in the Sanjiang Plain and examine its links to East Asian monsoon variations during the Holocene. The results show that 80% peatlands in the Sanjiang Plain initiated after 4.7 ka (1 ka = 1000 cal yr BP), with the largest initiating frequency around 4.5 ka. The mean C accumulation rate of peatlands in the Sanjiang Plain exhibits a synchronous increase with the peatlands expansion during the Holocene. Such a peatlands expanding and C accumulating pattern corresponds well to the remarkable drying event subsequent to the Holocene monsoon maximum.

They play important ecological roles, functioning as essential links between primary producers and planktivorous fish. Individuals zooplankton are important nodes of matter flow in pelagic ecosystems. The zooplankton community structure can provide useful indicators of top-down processes, such as the magnitude or strength of planktivorous predators and the extent of zooplankton grazing. Here we report the abundance of zooplankton taxa (crustaceans and rotifers) that were recorded monthly, from January 1980 to September 2015, at two stations on Lake Kasumigaura, a shallow eutrophic lake that is the second largest lake in Japan. The data include information on 12 copepod species (taxa), 20 cladoceran species (taxa), 40 rotifer species (taxa), and the opossum shrimp (Neomysis intermedia). In the 1980s, the plankton of the lake were characterized by cyanobacterial blooms and the co-dominance of Bosmina and Diaphanosoma in the summer. In addition, the two cladoceran genera, Daphnia galeata and Chydorus sphaericus were often prominent. The plankton profile changed dramatically in the middle (1997-2004) of the present long-term monitoring period, when cyanobacteria disappeared and diatoms became dominant even in the summer; concurrently, only the Diaphanosoma cladocerans were evident. However, in the past 10 years, cyanobacterial blooms, the co-dominance of Bosmina and Diaphanosoma, and D. galeata have re-emerged. Zooplankton monitoring forms part of the Lake Kasumigaura Long-Term Environmental Monitoring Program, which has been conducted by the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) since 1977. Data on other planktonic components (phytoplankton and the elements of microbial food webs) noted during monitoring and on primary production were published in Takamura and Nakagawa (Ecol Res 27:839 2012a, Ecol Res 27:837 2012b, Ecol Res 31:287 2016). Lake Kasumigaura is a core site of the Japan Long-term Ecological Research Network, a member of the International Long-term Ecological Research Network. Our quantitative dataset spanning several decades is unique in terms of the work on lakes and the plankton therein, and is freely available. The dataset has been used in ecological and environmental programs, as well as in studies on lake management.																			0912-3814	1440-1703				JAN	2017	32	1					1	1		10.1007/s11284-016-1406-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-016-1406-3													WOS:000391932600001

In this study, seasonal variations of dissolved and emitted methane in the Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, are investigated based on a specially designed monitoring. As a typical subtropical linking-to-river lake, the Poyang shows characteristics of the "lake" in wet season and the "river" in dry season alternatively over a year. Consequently, CH(4)flux from the Poyang Lake to the Yangtze River closes to the highest in January due to concentrated dissolved CH(4)and "river" effects in dry season, while CH(4)flux to the atmosphere falls to the lowest in July because of intensified CH(4)oxidization and diluted dissolved CH(4)as well as "lake" effects in wet season. Overall, CH(4)fluxes from Poyang Lake to the atmosphere and to the Yangtze River were 19 and 0.35 Gg CH(4)yr(-1), respectively. The Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest dam in the Yangtze River, would further intensify this pattern, enhancing the transformation between "lake phase" and "river phase". This study also provides the paradigm for CH(4)budget from other large lakes in similar situations around the world.					柴, 祖映/HDM-9186-2022														1674-7321	1869-1900				JAN	2021	64	1					203	212		10.1007/s11431-020-1594-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11431-020-1594-6		JUL 2020											WOS:000547360900004

The extent of glass effects and other interfering effects stemming from the rapid change of the interior milieu of the bottle were determined. The applicability of the new method (incubation with dialyzing sacks), where these side effects presumably do not occur, was also tested. Interrelations of production, elimination and actual biomass, as the effects of zooplankton predation were evaluated. A schematic representation of the matter-energy flow system for the illuminated period of the day was outlined for the various plankton groups studied.																			0003-9136						1980	89	4					474	482																WOS:A1980KH48100006

In this study, a numerical model - driven by radiative, atmospheric and turbulent heat fluxes from the water body beneath the ice cover - was implemented to investigate the impact of climate change on the ice covers from two Antarctic lakes: west lobe of Lake Bonney (WLB) and Crooked Lake. Model results agreed well with measured ice thicknesses of both lakes (WLB - RMSE= 0.11 m over 16 years of data; Crooked Lake - RMSE= 0.07 m over 1 year of data), and had acceptable results with measured ablation data at WLB (RMSE= 0.28 m over 6 years). The differences between measured and modeled ablation occurred because the model does not consider interannual variability of the ice optical properties and seasonal changes of the lake's thermal structure. Results indicate that projected summer air temperatures will increase the ice-cover annual melting in WLB by 2050, but that the ice cover will remain perennial through the end of this century. Contrarily, at Crooked Lake the ice cover becomes ephemeral most likely due to the increase in air temperatures.

J	LAM, CWY				LAM, CWY			ECOLOGICAL-STUDIES OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN THE WAIKATO RIVER AND ITS CATCHMENT	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Most of the main streams and lakes of the Waikato catchment were surveyed for phytoplankton in April 1974 and Feb. 1975; 69 genera (118 spp.) of phytoplankton were identified. Phytoplankton density increased going downstream along the Waikato River and the diversity of phytoplankton communities increased with distance from the river mouth. An explosive increase in algal density in the center of Lake Ohakuri was found in both surveys. The increase probably was probably associated with an increase of nutrients and a shift from river to lake environment in this part of the river system. Diatoms dominated the Waikato River and most of its tributaries. Blue-green glage formed blooms in the lowland lakes. Green algae were common, but were never dominant in any locality. The seasonal succession of some major species in the lower Waikato River (i.e., at Ngaruawahia, Rangiriri and Tuakau) was determined from Sept. 1973 to Aug. 1974. Most species were most abundant in summer. Phytoplankton density was positively correlated with temperature and negatively with nitrate concentration. Flow rate may exert an overall control on phytoplankton growth in the Waikato River.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1981	15	1					95	103		10.1080/00288330.1981.9515902	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1981.9515902													WOS:A1981LQ06500012

The Limagne Basin: a journey through modern and fossil microbial deposits☆	BSGF-EARTH SCIENCES BULLETIN												The Limagne Basin (Massif Central, France) originated during a major, European-scale, extensive event (European Cenozoic Rift System), which led to the formation of several rift systems in the foreland of the Alps between the Upper Eocene and Pliocene. A fluvio-lacustrine system emplaced in the basin and resulted in a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic sedimentation in which microbial and metazoan buildups occupy an important place. However, microbial deposits are not exclusive to the Cenozoic history of the Limagne Basin; nowadays, in the basin, they still form in association with thermal spring systems. A fieldtrip was carried out in the Limagne Basin as part of the Microbialites: formation, evolution and diagenesis (M-Fed) meeting (October 2019). The objective of this excursion was to assess the diversity of modern and fossil (Chattian to Aquitanian) microbial sediments and structures in three prime locations (the Jussat and Chadrat outcrops and the Grand Gandaillat quarry). A detailed description of the morphologies and fabrics of the buildups and their associated biotic components can be used to discuss the spatio-temporal distribution pattern. Different basin margin models are proposed based on the changes in the distribution, morphology and size of the microbial and metazoan-rich deposits through time. The Jussat outcrop offers novel perspectives to unravel the evolution of the lacustrine/palustrine cycles over time and to establish a long-term paleoenvironmental history of the western margin of the basin during the Aquitanian. These cycles are composed of (i) lacustrine sedimentation comprising microbial and metazoan buildups and organic matter-rich marls reflecting a period of high accommodation, and (ii) palustrine deposits made of mudstones and clayey paleosoils, indicative of a period of low accommodation. It is suggested that climatic, tectonic, volcanic and local parameters (physiography, substrate) control the deposition of the buildups in each of the different cycles. In addition, the modern microbial mats of the Sainte-Marguerite and La Poix outcrops offer an opportunity to constrain the controlling processes at the origin of the mineralization involved in the formation of the microbialites and their preservation in the fossil record.					; Visscher, Peter/J-4729-2013; GERARD, Emmanuelle/A-3828-2013	Vennin, Emmanuelle/0000-0002-5899-0399; Boussagol, Pierre/0000-0001-8688-7885; Visscher, Peter/0000-0002-2143-8760; GERARD, Emmanuelle/0000-0002-4910-747X; Bouton, Anthony/0000-0002-1414-5708; Gaucher, Eric C./0000-0002-7976-8455													0037-9409	1777-5817				OCT 19	2021	192								41	10.1051/bsgf/2021030	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bsgf/2021030													WOS:000708645900001

Holocene changes in forest composition in northern Patagonia responded to climate with little impact of disturbance	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Postglacial climate change and changing disturbance regimes have shaped the vegetation composition in the forest-steppe ecotone in northern Patagonia (Argentina and Chile; lat. 40 degrees-lat. 43 degrees S). Several investigations between 41 degrees and 43 degrees S document shifts in the position of the forest-steppe ecotone and the population expansion of the cypress Austrocedrus chilensis, while little is known about the vegetation dynamic of Nothofagus alpina and Nothofagus obliqua within the Lacar basin. With the aim to contribute to this respect, the sediments of a small lake within a dense Nothofagus forest, in the Lanin National Park were collected and analysed in high resolution for pollen charcoal and sediment composition. Additionally, this work assessed the role of natural disturbance on vegetation composition. Results document the environmental history for the last 11,600 years. The record indicates high fire activity during the early Holocene, associated with dry conditions and the presence of a diverse Nothofagus shrubland. The middle Holocene starts with increased percentage of Cupressaceae pollen (up to 15%) which drops following the dominance of Nothofagus associated with wet conditions and low fire frequency. The late Holocene is marked by the rise in the abundance of N. obliqua and N. alpina, documenting the spread and increased importance of these trees within the Lacar basin during the last two millennia. A statistically significant effect of ash deposition on overall vegetation composition could not be detected, while Hydrangea and Lomatia hirsuta seem to benefit from ash fall. Fire affected stands of A. chilensis and N. obliqua/N. alpina, but climate was likely the dominant factor controlling average vegetation composition. Recent anthropogenic disturbance is noticeable by the presence of introduced taxa Rumex, Plantago and Pinus, and by the decrease in the percentage of Nothofagus obliqua-type, associated to extensive timber activities around the Lacar basin.

The effects of hypolimnetic anoxia on the diel vertical migration of freshwater crustacean zooplankton	ECOSPHERE												Lakes and reservoirs worldwide are increasingly experiencing depletion of dissolved oxygen (anoxia) in their bottom waters (the hypolimnion) because of climate change and eutrophication, which is altering the dynamics of many freshwater ecological communities. Hypolimnetic anoxia may substantially alter the daily migration and distribution of zooplankton, the dominant grazers of phytoplankton in aquatic food webs. In waterbodies with oxic hypolimnia, zooplankton exhibit diel vertical migration (DVM), in which they migrate to the dark hypolimnion during the day to escape fish predation or ultraviolet (UV) radiation damage in the well-lit surface waters (the epilimnion). However, due to the physiologically stressful conditions of anoxic hypolimnia, we hypothesized that zooplankton may be forced to remain in the epilimnion during daylight, trading oxic stress for increased predation risk or UV radiation damage. To examine how anoxia impacts zooplankton vertical migration, distribution, biomass, and community composition over day-night periods, we conducted multiple diel sampling campaigns on reservoirs that spanned oxic, hypoxic, and anoxic hypolimnetic conditions. In addition, we sampled the same reservoirs fortnightly during the daytime to examine the vertical position of zooplankton throughout the summer stratified season. Under anoxic conditions, most zooplankton taxa were predominantly found in the epil-imnion during the day and night, did not exhibit DVM, and had lower seasonal biomass than in reservoirs with oxic hypolimnia. Only the phantom midge larva, Chaoborus spp., was consistently anoxia-tolerant. Consequently, our results suggest that hypolimnetic anoxia may alter zooplankton migration, biomass, and behavior, which may in turn exacerbate water quality degradation due to the critical role zooplankton play in freshwater ecosystems.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of hypolimnetic withdrawal on Lake Varese, a 24 mdeep and 14.8 km(2)-large subalpine lake in North-Western Italy. The lake suffered from extended eutrophication in the second half of the 20th century due to uncontrolled delivery of untreated urban sewage. Several restoration measures have been implemented during the years, including hypolimnetic withdrawal. In 2019, a cooperative programme for the protection and management of the lake and its surroundings was launched, establishing a systematic annual hypolimnetic withdrawal in the stratified season since 2020. In this research, we calibrated a one-dimensional (1D) coupled ecological-hydrodynamic model (General Lake Model/Aquatic EcoDynamics - GLM/AED2) of Lake Varese with data surveyed in the lake in 2019-2021. Model simulations of the period 2020-2021 with and without the performed withdrawal proved the effectiveness of this measure on hypolimnetic P concentration reduction. Then, future simulations of 2023-2085 were carried out to predict the future efficiency of hypolimnetic withdrawal and of reductions in external nutrient loads under climate change scenarios. Results show that the prescribed withdrawal increases hypolimnetic temperatures. This effect, coupled with thermocline deepening due to global warming, will possibly lead to decreasing water mass stability in autumn and shorter stratification in the moderately deep Lake Varese, with an eventual decrease of P concentrations in the water column. The future effectiveness of hypolimnetic withdrawal is further discussed considering the possible role of dry periods.					; ROGORA, MICHELA/IZD-8951-2023; ROGORA, MICHELA/B-9237-2008; Dresti, Claudia/ITT-6857-2023; Fenocchi, Andrea/ITT-9012-2023	Dresti, Claudia/0000-0002-0666-1278; ROGORA, MICHELA/0000-0003-3515-0220; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				DEC 1	2023	347								119042	10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.119042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.119042		SEP 2023						37774663					WOS:001086170600001

Although concentrations of zinc and chromium differed greatly among the four species, both metals were consistently higher in Eriocaulon. Generally, root and rhizome tissue contained higher zinc and chromium than shoot tissues of the same species and site. Zinc concentrations (dry weight) ranged from 6.3 mug g-1 in Nuphar shoots to 87-7 mug g-1 in whole Eriocaulon. Chromium ranged from 0.23 mug g-1 in Pontederia shoots to 23-9 mug g-1 in whole Eriocaulon. No significant trends were detected throughout the growing season in macrophyte or sediment concentrations of either metal. Results of multiple linear regression analyses of several water quality and environmental variables on Eriocaulon indicated that sediment zinc was the best predictor of plant zinc, and sediment chromium and calcium were the best predictors of plant chromium.																			0269-7491						1993	79	3					261	265		10.1016/0269-7491(93)90098-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0269-7491(93)90098-9								15091887					WOS:A1993KH91800008

Sinninghe			Spatial and seasonal contrasts of sedimentary organic matter in floodplain lakes of the central Amazon basin	BIOGEOSCIENCES												In this study, we investigated the seasonal and spatial pattern of sedimentary organic matter (SOM) in five floodplain lakes of the central Amazon basin (Cabaliana, Janauaca, Canacari, Mirituba and Curuai) which have different morphologies, hydrodynamics and vegetation coverages. Surface sediments were collected in four hydrological seasons: low water (LW), rising water (RW), high water (HW) and falling water (FW) in 2009 and 2010. We investigated commonly used bulk geochemical tracers such as the C : N ratio and the stable isotopic composition of organic carbon (delta C-13(org)). These results were compared with lignin phenol parameters as an indicator of vascular plant detritus and branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) to trace the input of soil organic matter (OM) from land to the aquatic settings. We also applied the crenarchaeol as an indicator of aquatic (rivers and lakes) OM. Our data showed that during the RW and FW seasons, the surface sediments were enriched in lignin and brGDGTs in comparison to other seasons. Our study also indicated that floodplain lake sediments primarily consisted of allochthonous, C-3 plant-derived OM. However, a downstream increase in C-4 macrophyte-derived OM contribution was observed along the gradient of increasing open waters - i.e., from upstream to downstream. Accordingly, we attribute the temporal and spatial difference in SOM composition to the hydrological dynamics between the floodplain lakes and the surrounding flooded forests.					; Sinninghe Damste, Jaap/F-6128-2011; Bernardes, Marcelo/H-7869-2012; Meziane, Tarik/AAF-7906-2020; Abril, Gwenaël/C-7835-2011; mortillaro, Jean-Michel/A-2496-2012; Moreira-Turcq, Patricia/IYT-2754-2023; Damste, Jaap/F-6128-2011	Abril, Gwenael/0000-0002-4914-086X; Sinninghe Damste, Jaap/0000-0002-8683-1854; MEZIANE, Tarik/0000-0003-2142-6441; Bernardes, Marcelo/0000-0002-4338-4353; Mortillaro, Jean-Michel/0000-0003-1911-9338; Moreira-Turcq, Patricia/0000-0003-4299-2768; 													1726-4170	1726-4189					2016	13	2					467	482		10.5194/bg-13-467-2016	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-467-2016													WOS:000369524500009

A 3-year study showed that the magnitude of mercury deposition was dominated by the quantity of precipitation. Regional variations of mercury concentrations in precipitation;were mostly explained by precipitation rate with higher concentrations occurring in the summer. Statewide (Minnesota) annual mercury emission estimates exceeded depositions for 1990, 1991, and 1992 by a factor of approximately 2 and indicated long-range transport of mercury. Significant correlations were observed between concentrations of mercury and other ions in precipitation.																			0013-936X					NOV	1994	28	12					2025	2032		10.1021/es00061a010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00061a010								22191741					WOS:A1994PP82900012

Therefore, body growth rate and muscle protein turnover of cultivated rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) of 0+ and 1+ year-classes were studied within a growing season since June to October. Fish grown on cages on a natural lake does not face with food shortage or other growth-retarding factors, and the environmental water temperature affects fish growth primarily. There were detected that water temperature increase in-season results in maximal growth increments and maximal protein turnover rate in trout muscles. Since protein synthesis recognized to be similar between individuals, high overall protein turnover rate depended on increased protein-degrading activities mostly relying on calpain system. Trout of different yearclasses significantly differs in growth rate and calpain activity coordinately decreasing with age while their temperature responses are quite similar. New data expands on aquaculture practice since based on our observations on coincidence of peak water temperatures (mid-summer) and increased muscle protease activities in trout we can recommend excluding this period for fish slaughter to avoid postmortem flesh deterioration and excessive fillet softening.

The importance of freshwater systems to the net atmospheric exchange of carbon dioxide and methane with a rapidly changing high Arctic watershed	BIOGEOSCIENCES												A warming climate is rapidly changing the distribution and exchanges of carbon within high Arctic ecosystems. Few data exist, however, which quantify exchange of both carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) between the atmosphere and freshwater systems, or estimate freshwater contributions to total catchment exchange of these gases, in the high Arctic. During the summers of 2005 and 2007-2012, we quantified CO2 and CH4 concentrations in, and atmospheric exchange with, common freshwater systems in the high Arctic watershed of Lake Hazen, Nunavut, Canada. We identified four types of biogeochemically distinct freshwater systems in the watershed; however mean CO2 concentrations (21-28 mu mol L-1)and atmospheric exchange (0.013 to +0.046 g C-CO2 m(-2) day(-1)) were similar between these systems. Seasonal flooding of ponds bordering Lake Hazen generated considerable CH4 emissions to the atmosphere (+0.008 g C-CH4 m(-2) day(-1)) , while all other freshwater systems were minimal emitters of this gas (< +0.001 g C-CH4 m(-2) day(-1)). When using ecosystem-cover classification mapping and data from previous studies, we found that freshwaters were unimportant contributors to total watershed carbon exchange, in part because they covered less than 10% of total area in the watershed. High Arctic watersheds are experiencing warmer and wetter climates than in the past, which may have implications for moisture availability, landscape cover, and the exchange of CO2 and CH4 of underproductive but expansive polar semidesert ecosystems.

Surface Geophysical Methods for Characterising Frozen Ground in Transitional Permafrost Landscapes	PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES												The distribution of shallow frozen ground is paramount to research in cold regions, and is subject to temporal and spatial changes influenced by climate, landscape disturbance and ecosystem succession. Remote sensing from airborne and satellite platforms is increasing our understanding of landscape-scale permafrost distribution, but typically lacks the resolution to characterise finer-scale processes and phenomena, which are better captured by integrated surface geophysical methods. Here, we demonstrate the use of electrical resistivity imaging (ERI), electromagnetic induction (EMI), ground penetrating radar (GPR) and infrared imaging over multiple summer field seasons around the highly dynamic Twelvemile Lake, Yukon Flats, central Alaska, USA. Twelvemile Lake has generally receded in the past 30yr, allowing permafrost aggradation in the receded margins, resulting in a mosaic of transient frozen ground adjacent to thick, older permafrost outside the original lakebed. ERI and EMI best evaluated the thickness of shallow, thin permafrost aggradation, which was not clear from frost probing or GPR surveys. GPR most precisely estimated the depth of the active layer, which forward electrical resistivity modelling indicated to be a difficult target for electrical methods, but could be more tractable in time-lapse mode. Infrared imaging of freshly dug soil pit walls captured active-layer thermal gradients at unprecedented resolution, which may be useful in calibrating emerging numerical models. GPR and EMI were able to cover landscape scales (several kilometres) efficiently, and new analysis software showcased here yields calibrated EMI data that reveal the complicated distribution of shallow permafrost in a transitional landscape.

Delays in the recovery of freshwater streams and lakes in eastern Canada from historically high levels of acidic precipitation have been partially ascribed to these periodic pulses of SO42-. Climate in eastern Canada has also changed within the last 25 a, with a documented increase in summer dryness and duration of droughts. In small forested catchments in the Turkey Lakes Watershed (TLW), SO42- concentrations in streams draining wetlands can be elevated by up to a factor of 7 during post-drought discharge events compared to the annual average. Two neighbouring catchments, one with a series of cascading wetlands and one without any wetlands, were selected for comparison. Stable S and O isotope ratios were analyzed in samples of bulk precipitation, streams, and groundwaters to examine sources of SO42- in post-drought pulses. delta S-34-SO42- in the streams and groundwaters show that SO42- is retained in the wetland via SO42- reduction and stored in the upper peat profile. Nitrate is elevated in soil and groundwaters at TLW due to high rates of nitrification in forest soils and the presence of NO3- can be used to identify piezometers unaffected by SO42- reduction. delta O-18-SO42- shows that higher concentrations of SO42- in deeper groundwater are likely due to oxidation of organic S and not a geologic source of reduced S. Following drought, the low delta S-34-SO42- in streams is consistent with wetland retention by SO42- reduction and much lower than SO42- released by weathering in deep glacial till and bedrock. High SO42- groundwaters and geologic sources do not contribute to the S02- pulses in streams. Isotopic patterns over 6 a were similar. Pulses of SO42- in the wetland catchments following drought are a result of the oxidation of S previously reduced and stored in the wetland. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Benthic mats often remain inconspicuous until they float to the surface because of trapped gas bubbles or until high winds and wave action dislodge and wash mats ashore. Mats induce dark, anoxic conditions conducive to nutrient mineralization, atmospheric N-2 fixation, and heterotrophic metabolism. Lyngbya wollei has been found historically in southeastern USA, but genetically similar subgroups have been proliferating more recently in the Laurentian Great Lakes and the St Lawrence River. This taxon is found under contrasting environmental conditions, including very clear, thermally and chemically stable, and heavily mineralized Florida Springs and turbid, high dissolved organic C, and seasonally variable conditions, influenced by agricultural tributaries in the St Lawrence River. Lyngbya wollei produces a number of unique saxitoxins and volatile organic compounds that are responsible for a musty-earthy taste and odor in water, which affect aesthetics and recreational water uses. Mats of L. wollei are less palatable than other vegetation but provide shelter for invertebrates, which hide in dark mats of filaments. In the St Lawrence River, wetlands dominated by L. wollei tend to be characterized by a lower biomass of invertebrates and large fish, lower fish species richness, and slower-growing juvenile fish than macrophyte-dominated wetlands. Replacement of macrophytes by L. wollei mats induces a shift in trophic structure and coincides with a decrease in carrying capacity for fish, and significantly alters the dynamics of freshwater ecosystems.

Conservation, Reallocation and more Efficient Use of Water	AT THE CONFLUENCE - SELECTION FROM THE 2013 WORLD WATER WEEK	Aquatic Procedia				Annual World Water Week (WWW)	SEP 01-06, 2013	Stockholm, SWEDEN	SIWI				Overexploitation of water resources in the Shiyang River Basin, an inland river in Gansu, China has promoted a prosperous agricultural economy but at the same time caused downstream flows to sharply reduce and the groundwater table to fall rapidly. This has degraded local ecosystems and caused the terminal lake to completely dry up. A project for addressing these problems was initiated aimed at rescuing a downstream oasis that was at risk of being buried by the moving dunes. During the project implementation, the irrigation area has been decreased, a water conservation program introduced and water use reallocated between upstream and downstream users and between economic and ecosystem services. Positive results have started to appear. The main factors in this preliminary success are positive political will and central government support; the acceptance and wide participation by water users and the establishment of a powerful integrated water resources management organisation.

The accuracy of the estimation is analyzed using empirical band-ratio algorithms together with in situ observations that include water samples analyzed in a laboratory (variation ranges: 22-130 mu g/l 2.9-20 mg/l, and 1.29-2.61 m(-1) for chl-a, TSS and aCDOM(400), respectively). Additional in situ estimates (transects) on these characteristics are available through absorption and scattering coefficients measured with an ac-9 absorption and attenuation meter installed in a flow-through system. The retrieval accuracy (R-2) of all three water quality characteristics with MERIS data is close to or above 0.9, while the RMSE is 7.8 mu g/l (22%), 0.74 mg/l (16%) and 0.08 m(-1) (5%), for chl-a, TSS and CICDOM(400), respectively. The validity of the chl-a algorithm is tested using nine additional data points. The BIAS-error for these points is 5.2 mu g/l and the RMSE is 10.6 mu g/l. The effects of changes in the atmospheric characteristics on band-ratio algorithms in cases where no concurrent in situ reference data are available are analyzed using the MODerate spectral resolution atmospheric TRANSmittance algorithm and computer model (MODTRAN). The additional error due to these changes is estimated to be below 20% for the applied ratio algorithms. The water quality data available in the level 2 MERIS-product distributed by the European Space Agency did not include valid results for the date investigated here. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The collapse of the Larsen B Ice Shelf in 2002 has been attributed to the sudden drainage of similar to 3000 surface lakes and has highlighted the potential for surface water to cause ice-shelf instability. Surface meltwater systems have been identified across numerous Antarctic ice shelves, although the extent to which these systems impact ice-shelf instability is poorly constrained. To better understand the role of surface meltwater systems on ice shelves, it is important to track their seasonal development, monitoring the fluctuations in surface water volume and the transfer of water across ice-shelf surfaces. Here, we use Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery to track surface meltwater across the Nivlisen Ice Shelf in the 2016-2017 melt season. We develop the Fully Automated Supraglacial-Water Tracking algorithm for Ice Shelves (FASTISh) and use it to identify and track the development of 1598 water bodies, which we classify as either circular or linear. The total volume of surface meltwater peaks on 26 January 2017 at 5.5 x 10(7) m(3). At this time, 63 % of the total volume is held within two linear surface meltwater systems, which are up to 27 km long, are orientated along the ice shelf's north-south axis, and follow the surface slope. Over the course of the melt season, they appear to migrate away from the grounding line, while growing in size and enveloping smaller water bodies. This suggests there is large-scale lateral water transfer through the surface meltwater system and the firn pack towards the ice-shelf front during the summer.

This is the first most fully investigated (1149 m(2)) site of the Early Iron Age in the mountain-forest Trans-Urals, located on a low lakeside terrace. The pottery and tool complexes of the Gamayun culture that came from the north, the local Itkul and the heterogeneous Iset archaeological cultures characterize the inhabitants of the settlements as sedentary fishermen and hunters familiar with the basics of the producing economy (copper foundry, livestock breeding). The absence of stationary dwellings and a strong cultural layer is characteristic of summer seasonal settlements. Finds of pottery from the Gorokhovo and Baitovo cultures confirm the resettlement of population groups from the Tobol River region to the Trans-Ural taiga in the 5th-3rd centuries BC under the onslaught of the Sargat cattle-breeding tribes advancing from the forest-steppe Ishim-Irtysh region.

Applications of hydrodynamic models to lakes can provide insights into possible future alterations in thermal dynamics induced by climate change. In this study, we present the calibration and validation of the newest version of the open-source hydrodynamic model GLM (General Lake Model) to the dimictic Lake Ammersee, located in southeast Germany. The simulation of lake water temperatures for the calibration period revealed an overall root mean square error of 0.65 degrees C and a mean error of 0.08 degrees C. The seasonal stratification pattern and the annual thermal structure of this dimictic lake were reproduced by the model. The model simulated the presence of winter ice cover for the only year out of 8 years simulated, when ice cover was observed. Elevated lake water temperatures were also reproduced in model simulations during a period in 2003 of unusually high air temperatures. Statistical analysis of the model calibration results for Lake Ammersee indicates a fit comparable to or better than most other well-established hydrodynamic models and provides an opportunity for continuous simulations through periods of ice cover. Our results indicate a major improvement in GLM compared with earlier model versions and demonstrate the applicability of GLM for limnophysical studies, particularly for altered forcing conditions such as climate change.					; Hamilton, David/F-5039-2012; Hamilton, David P/F-5039-2012	Bueche, Thomas/0000-0002-9588-398X; Hamilton, David P/0000-0002-9341-8777													1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	13							461	10.1007/s12665-017-6790-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-017-6790-7													WOS:000405283600016

The phytoplankton and physicochemical analyses were carried out on seven urban lakes in Kartuzy and Skepe. The Phytoplankton Metric for Polish Lakes was used to assess the ecological status and the Trophic Level Index was used to determine the trophic state. Only one lake had a good ecological status (meeting the WFD requirements for at least good status), whereas other lakes had poor or bad ecological status. All of them were eutrophic or hyper-eutrophic and the summer phytoplankton assemblages were dominated mainly by bloom-forming cyanobacteria. The lowest phytoplankton bloom threshold of 2.6 mm(3) l(-1) (seasonal maximum) and the following thresholds of 5 mm(3) l(-1) for classes I/II; 8 mm(3) l(-1) for classes II/III; 21 mm(3) l(-1) for classes III/IV; 100 mm(3) l(-1) for classes IV/V were proposed for urban lakes. This could directly refer to the bloom intensity for high, good, moderate, poor and bad ecological status. This all indicates a huge recovery requirement in the majority of urban lakes, and the proposed bloom intensity classification may be helpful in fulfilling the WFD targets for the ecologically-relevant lake status.

The surveys show that peak numbers of adults and goslings during the moult period July-August have flattened out since 1986. In agreement with predictions on grazing capacity of shoreline vegetation, the density of geese in the various lake systems has now converged to the same value throughout. This suggests that the lakeside tundra limits capacity during the flightless period when the geese are vulnerable to fox predation. The area was colonised for nesting in 1963, but despite the current stability in summer numbers, the nest counts on the three major breeding islets continue to rise. Gosling production from the study area has dropped in absolute terms since at least 1980, and this decline is viewed as evidence for density-dependence on the breeding grounds. Losses on the breeding islands and among very young goslings have risen dramatically and a plea is made for further research to identify the causal mechanisms behind these changes.

Furthermore, the application of Delta 47 analyses on the ostracod species Candona angulata and Cyprideis torosa from Lake Trasimeno record (central Italy), which today precipitate their shells during the cold and the warm season respectively provides evidence that by combining biological (i.e., ostracod shell precipitation timing), paleontological (i.e., identification of ostracod species) and geochemical (i.e., Delta 47) approaches, the ostracod-Delta 47 thermometer accurately reconstructs past seasonality. Despite the absence of a vital effect, not all species can be combined for Delta 47 analyses in environments with seasonal temperature variations; only those that precipitate their shells during the same season should be considered. The application of the ostracod-Delta 47 thermometer on the Trasimeno lacustrine record gives rise to the first continental warm season paleotemperature reconstruction of the last 43 ky in central Mediterranean area. The combination of Delta 47 and oxygen isotope composition (delta 18Oost) measured on ostracod shells provides the isotopic composition of the water from which the carbonate precipitated (delta 18Ow) and thereby, changes in the evaporation/precipitation balance in this area. Before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), equivalent to the Marine Isotopic Stage 3 (MIS3, from 43 to 29ky), warm season temperatures ranged from 15 +/- 1.6 degrees C to 22 +/- 2.3 degrees C, equivalent to 2 to 6 degrees C colder than today. Hydrological conditions during this period are similar to the present-day ones, characterized by a permanent lake and a high evaporation/precipitation ratio (E/P). The drastic decrease of the warm season temperatures (ranging from 10 +/- 2.9 degrees C to 17 +/- 3.1 degrees C) and of the E/P ratio during LGM and Late-glacial (MIS2, from 29 to 11.6 ky) correspond to the global climate cooling and low summer insolation, suggesting an amplifying role, of the latter, in the effects of the millennial scale climatic variations. At the Pleistocene/Holocene transition, both warm season temperature (25 +/- 2 degrees C) and the E/P ratio increased in conjunction with the summer insolation. During the early Holocene, warm season temperature (23 +/- 2 degrees C) closely resembles present-day values. However, cold season temperature (12 +/- 2 degrees C) is approximately 4 degrees CC warmer than today. Notably, no hydrological differences are identified between the warm and the cold season underlying a lower seasonality contrast compared to the present, along with enhanced warm season precipita-tion. The good agreement between the Delta 47 temperatures reconstructed for the last 1 ky and the temperatures presently recorded at Lake Trasimeno (8 degrees C cold and 22 degrees C for warm season), confirms the accuracy of the analyses and the applicability of the ostracod-Delta 47 thermometer to reconstruct seasonal temperature changes.

DNA metabarcoding of unfractionated water samples relates phyto-, zoo- and bacterioplankton dynamics and reveals a single-taxon bacterial bloom	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS												Most studies of aquatic plankton focus on either macroscopic or microbial communities, and on either eukaryotes or prokaryotes. This separation is primarily for methodological reasons, but can overlook potential interactions among groups. Here we tested whether DNA metabarcoding of unfractionated water samples with universal primers could be used to qualitatively and quantitatively study the temporal dynamics of the total plankton community in a shallow temperate lake. Significant changes in the relative proportions of normalized sequence reads of eukaryotic and prokaryotic plankton communities over a 3-month period in spring were found. Patterns followed the same trend as plankton estimates measured using traditional microscopic methods. The bloom of a conditionally rare bacterial taxon belonging to Arcicella was characterized, which rapidly came to dominate the whole lake ecosystem and would have remained unnoticed without metabarcoding. The data demonstrate the potential of universal DNA metabarcoding applied to unfractionated samples for providing a more holistic view of plankton communities.

Explanations of the dense bone and stone tool accumulation range from a site on a featureless lake margin that is dominantly anthropogenic in origin to a site near a freshwater wetland that is dominated by carnivore activity (e.g. felids and hyenas). FLK North occurs stratigraphically between the Ng'eju Tuff (1.818 +/- 0.006 Ma) and Tuff IF (1.803 +/- 0.002 Ma), and is composed of 9 distinct levels. Analysis of newly recovered fossil bones and artifacts has shown that the bones of large animals are largely the product of felid hunting and feeding behavior, followed by hyena gnawing and breakage of some bones. The expanded sample of felid prey remains is significant for understanding the contrasts between the mortality profiles of fossil assemblages produced by carnivores and those produced by hominins. Geologic mapping in the environs of the site has revealed rich sedimentological and paleoecological records and a thin, but persistent tuff (here named Kidogo Tuff) that is similar to 1.5 m below Tuff IF. Electron microprobe analyses of the tuff mineralogy revealed a unique geochemical fingerprint that permits its use for correlation of widely separated outcrops and facilitates the high resolution reconstruction of the landscape at the time of site formation. The 9 archaeological levels comprise a relatively continuous record through a Milankovitch precession cycle (dry-wet-dry). As the lake receded into the central basin during the dry part of the cycle, surface water supplies dwindled and groundwater-fed springs and wetlands became the dominant freshwater supply. The FLK North archaeological record essentially ended when level 1 was covered with 0.4 m of Tuff IF in a violent volcanic eruption of nearby Mt. Olmoti. However, the overlying Bed II sediments contain scattered archaeological material and a freshwater carbonate deposit that is similar to those found associated with other Bed II archaeological sites, e.g. VEK, HWK and HWKE. The recognition of the ecological association of springs, wetlands and archaeological remains is a powerful predictive tool for locating new archaeological sites in this region that is known for hominin remains.

J	Hofmann, H; Lorke, A; Peeters, F				Hofmann, Hilmar; Lorke, Andreas; Peeters, Frank			The relative importance of wind and ship waves in the littoral zone of a large lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Surface waves and their interactions with sediments and benthic organisms are the main hydrodynamic process affecting littoral ecosystems. Here, we present a long-term data set on surface-wave parameters, which was obtained from the analysis of measurements with a pressure sensor. The data set covers a time period of a year and allows for resolving waves with heights down to less than a centimeter and frequencies up to 0.8 Hz. Wind waves and three different types of ship waves were distinguished by their spectral properties. In Lake Constance, ship-generated waves are as important as wind-generated waves and contribute about 41% of the annual mean wave energy flux to shore. In summer, during the most productive time period, ship waves dominate the wave field in terms of the energy flux to shore and also in their frequency of occurrence. Ship waves cause a diurnal and a seasonal pattern in the frequency of occurrence and in the heights of surface waves, whereas in the case of wind waves these parameters do not vary significantly with season or between nighttime and daytime. In contrast to wind waves that occur only sporadically, ship waves propagate into the littoral zone very frequently at regular time intervals. The different pattern of occurrence of ship and wind waves results in a different pattern of disturbance in the littoral ecosystem.

We assessed the BC composition of a littoral and two pelagic habitats (euphotic zone and hypolimnion) of Lake Tovel monthly from April 2014 to May 2017 by high-throughput sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene. The three habitats differed in temperature, light, oxygen and hydrology. In particular, the littoral was the most hydrologically unstable because it receives most of the lake inflow, the hypolimnion was the most stable because of its hydrologically sheltered position, and the pelagic euphotic habitat was intermediate. Consequently, we hypothesized different temporal patterns of BC composition for all three habitats according to their environmental differences. We applied PERMANOVA, nonmetric multidimensional scaling and source-sink analysis to characterize BC composition. Overall, BCs were different among habitats with the littoral showing the highest variability and the hypolimnion the highest stability. The BC of rainy 2014 was distinct from the BCs of other years irrespective of the habitats considered. Seasonal differences in BCs were limited to spring, probably linked to meltwater inflow and mixing. Thus, temporal effects related to year and season were linked to the hydrological gradient of habitats. We suggest that despite potential within-lake dispersal of bacterioplankton by water flow and mixing, local environmental conditions played a major role in Lake Tovel, fostering distinct BCs in the three habitats.					; Obertegger, Ulrike/A-8254-2010; Flaim, Giovanna/AAD-5013-2020; Flaim, Giovanna/C-7622-2016	Pindo, Massimo/0000-0002-8516-9010; Obertegger, Ulrike/0000-0002-4057-9366; Flaim, Giovanna/0000-0002-1753-5605													0962-1083	1365-294X				NOV	2018	27	21					4322	4335		10.1111/mec.14855	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.14855								30176079					WOS:000449800900013
J	Ku, TL; Luo, SD; Lowenstein, TK; Li, JR; Spencer, RJ				Ku, TL; Luo, SD; Lowenstein, TK; Li, JR; Spencer, RJ			U-series chronology of lacustrine deposits in Death Valley, California	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Uranium-series dating on a 186-m core (DV93-1) drilled from Badwater Basin in Death Valley, California, and on calcareous tufas from nearby strandlines shows that Lake Manly, the lake that periodically flooded Death Valley during the late Pleistocene, experienced large fluctuations in depth and chemistry over the last 200,000 yr. Death Valley has been occupied by a long-standing deep lake, perennial shallow saline lakes, and a desiccated salt pan similar to the modern valley floor. The average sedimentation rate of about 1 mm/yr for core DV93-1 was punctuated by episodes of more-rapid accumulation of halite. Arid conditions similar to the modern conditions prevailed during the entire Holocene and between 120,000 and 60,000 yr B.P. From 35,000 yr B.P. to the beginning of the Holocene, a perennial saline lake existed, over 70 m at its deepest. A much deeper and longer lasting perennial Lake Manly existed from about 185,000 to 128,000 yr B.P., with water depths reaching about 175 m, if not 330 m. This lake had two significant "dry" excursions of 10(2)-10(3) yr duration about 166,000 and 146,000 yr B.P., and it began to shrink to the point of halite precipitation between 128,000 and 120,000 yr B.P. The two perennial lake periods correspond to marine oxygen isotopic stages (OIS) 2 and 6. Based on the shoreline tufa ages, we do not rule out the possible existence -200,000 yr ago of yet a third perennial lake comparable in size to the OIS 6 lake. The U-234/U-238 data suggest that U in tufa owes its origin mainly to Ca-rich springs fed by groundwater that emanated along lake shorelines in southern Death Valley, and that an increase of this spring-water input relative to the river-water input apparently occurred during OIS 6.

The measured deposition fluxes were on the average half an order of magnitude larger than fluxes calculated from the cosmic-ray-induced atmospheric production. These discrepancies were tentatively explained by recycling of bomb Cl-36 from the biosphere as methyl chloride (CH3Cl) into the troposphere, destruction of CH3Cl by OH reactions and subsequent tropospheric deposition of Cl-36. Simulations were performed for natural atmospheric production, bomb fall-out and recycling of Cl-36. The simulations including recycling were qualitatively able to explain the excess in deposition fluxes, especially for tropical regions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

GHYRAF Team	Land Water Storage Changes from Ground and Space Geodesy: First Results from the GHYRAF (Gravity and Hydrology in Africa) Experiment	PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS												This paper is devoted to the first results from the GHYRAF (Gravity and Hydrology in Africa) experiment conducted since 2008 in West Africa and is aimed at investigating the changes in water storage in different regions sampling a strong rainfall gradient from the Sahara to the monsoon zone. The analysis of GPS vertical displacement in Niamey (Niger) and Djougou (Benin) shows that there is a clear annual signature of the hydrological load in agreement with global hydrology models like GLDAS. The comparison of GRACE solutions in West Africa, and more specifically in the Niger and Lake Chad basins, reveals a good agreement for the large scale annual water storage changes between global hydrology models and space gravity observations. Ground gravity observations done with an FG5 absolute gravimeter also show signals which can be well related to measured changes in soil and ground water. We present the first results for two sites in the Sahelian band (Wankama and Diffa in Niger) and one (Djougou in Benin) in the Sudanian monsoon region related to the recharge-discharge processes due to the monsoonal event in summer 2008 and the following dry season. It is confirmed that ground gravimetry is a useful tool to constrain local water storage changes when associated to hydrological and subsurface geophysical in situ measurements.

Yet, estimating changes in the activity of ice-dam failures through time remains controversial because of inconsistent regional flood databases. Here, by collating 1,569 ice-dam failures in six major mountain regions, we systematically assess trends in peak discharge, volume, annual timing and source elevation between 1900 and 2021. We show that extreme peak flows and volumes (10 per cent highest) have declined by about an order of magnitude over this period in five of the six regions, whereas median flood discharges have fallen less or have remained unchanged. Ice-dam floods worldwide today originate at higher elevations and happen about six weeks earlier in the year than in 1900. Individual ice-dammed lakes with repeated outbursts show similar negative trends in magnitude and earlier occurrence, although with only moderate correlation to glacier thinning(8). We anticipate that ice dams will continue to fail in the near future, even as glaciers thin and recede. Yet widespread deglaciation, projected for nearly all regions by the end of the twenty-first century(9), may bring most outburst activity to a halt.					; Clague, John/L-3619-2019; Hugonnet, Romain/JYP-3465-2024; Vogel, Kristin/H-6055-2019	Vogel, Kristin/0000-0002-3692-6492; Lutzow, Natalie/0000-0002-7311-3001; Korup, Oliver/0000-0002-9084-1895; Veh, Georg/0000-0003-4430-2601													0028-0836	1476-4687				FEB 23	2023	614	7949					701	+		10.1038/s41586-022-05642-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05642-9		FEB 2023						36792828					WOS:000933681400002

In south-east Iceland, a fracture in the mountainside of Svinafellsheioi threatens to cause between 60 and 100 million cubic metres of rock to fall onto the glacier below. A large landslide could break up the surface of the glacier, crash into the proglacial lake, and affect people and infrastructure downhill. In addition to the unprecedented scale, the Svinafellsheioi fracture represents the first time people and infrastructure have been exposed to this type of hazard in Iceland. In this article we examine the role of local knowledge in disaster risk reduction and management for communities that are facing a particular type of hazard for the first time. We argue that even when a community lacks experience with a specific type of hazard, local knowledge can still play a valuable role in hazard identification and risk management.																			2212-4209					MAY	2021	58								102187	10.1016/j.ijdrr.2021.102187	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2021.102187		MAR 2021											WOS:000649712500004

The fossils were deposited in a swamp or lake surrounded by a very open, dry environment. The lake was fed by artesian springs that raised the underlying Miocene sands. Although nothing suggests a camp or butchery site, we discovered the first undisputable bone artifact in this site, the earliest known in this part of Africa. According to paleontological data, 700,000 yr B.P. is a likely age for the Ternifine deposits, which is consistent with the paleomagnetic results.

In January 2003 a massive inflow of highly saline, cold and extremely oxygen-rich water from the North Sea was recorded at Darss Sill. This event is considered to be the most important inflow since 1993. A coupled model system for the Baltic Sea region, called BALTIMOS, was developed in the frame of DEKLIM/ BALTEX by linking existing model components for the atmosphere ( model REMO), for the ocean including sea ice ( model BSIOM), for the hydrology ( model LARSIM) as well as for lakes. The model system consists of high resolution model components: 1/6degrees (similar to18 km) with 20 vertical levels; ocean-ice 5 km with 60 vertical levels, hydrology 1/6degrees. The model domain covers the whole drainage basin of the Baltic Sea as well as major parts of Europe. The exceptional inflow events have been simulated successfully with BALTIMOS. The simulation was initialized at 1st of February 2002 and the model has been run until October 2003. This period includes the exceptional warm water inflow in autumn 2002 and the major Baltic inflow in January 2003. Different inflow characteristics are presented and discussed. The simulated volume transport for the major inflow in January 2003 amounts to about 250 km 3, half of which was of salinity 17 PSU which corresponds to a salt transport of 2.7 x 10(12) kg.

Mobile Laboratory Measurements of High Surface Ozone Levels and Spatial Heterogeneity During LISTOS 2018: Evidence for Sea Breeze Influence	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The Long Island Sound Tropospheric Ozone Study (LISTOS) was organized to investigate ozone formation and transport in the New York City metropolitan area and locations downwind. During LISTOS, the University at Albany Atmospheric Sciences Research Center (ASRC) mobile laboratory was used for measuring surface O-3, NO2, and aerosol number and mass concentration. Sharp O-3 concentration gradients, with Delta O-3 Delta y(-1) over 15 ppb km(-1), were measured both at and near the land-water interface and on the highway on days characterized by high regional O-3 concentrations. These large O-3 gradients at or near the land-water interface, and in air masses relatively low in NO2, are shown to be influenced in part by the transport of highly oxidized air masses via sea breeze circulation and convergence with gradient flow. On the highway under regionally high O-3 concentrations, strong anticorrelation (R-2 = 0.78, p < 0.05) between O-3 and NO2 and an absolute slope less than 1 suggested that O-x concentrations (O-3 + NO2) increased with increasing NO2. Overall, the on-road measurements made during LISTOS help to better characterize the interaction between the emitted pollution and the meteorological conditions on Long Island, thereby having potential policy implications. Plain Language Summary Ozone pollution is a significant problem for the New York City (NYC) Metropolitan Area, which has been classified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as being in noncompliance with the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone. The southern coast of Connecticut is the most severely affected by ozone pollution, which is produced in the atmosphere as it travels downwind from emission sources of precursor gases like oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds. The impact of ozone on a given location involves a complex interplay of emissions, meteorology, and chemistry. Our study explored aspects of this interplay on several polluted days in summer 2018 using a Dodge Sprinter van mobile laboratory equipped with instrumentation to measure ozone, one of the critical oxides of nitrogen, and other parameters. Some of the analysis days yielded significant and rapid changes in ozone concentration near the south or north shore of Long Island. Our results suggest that sea breeze winds can greatly influence ozone concentrations near the coast in some cases. Understanding when and how the sea breeze affects air quality in regions downwind of NYC and other coastal metropolitan areas will help efforts to improve air quality in these locations.					; Schwab, Janie/CAG-4711-2022; Schwab, Margaret/CAG-4711-2022; Zhang, Jie/ABE-9530-2020; Shrestha, Bhupal/GOP-1020-2022	Schwab, James/0000-0003-1343-4695; Schwab, Janie/0000-0002-0318-201X; Zhang, Jie/0000-0003-2935-9220; Shrestha, Bhupal/0000-0003-1459-0788; Ninneman, Matthew/0000-0001-5001-6439; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				JUN 16	2020	125	11							e2019JD031961	10.1029/2019JD031961	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JD031961													WOS:000541156800008

Morphologically they are similar to Nostoc, Desmonostoc, Halotia, and Mojavia and indistinguishable from Chlorogloeopsis. The parsimony and Bayesian phylogenies of the 16S rDNA show that these strains are close to nostocacean strains, in strongly supported clades and separated from all other genera. The secondary structures of the 16S-23S ITS were very consistent between strains of K. atlantica, but distinctly different from structures in other close taxa. Of special note, the Hawaiian strain of K. atlantica had 16S sequence identities of 99.5-100% to the Brazilian strains, and 16S-23S ITS sequence identities of 99.4-99.8% to the Brazilian strains, and consequently likely represents a very recent introduction of the species to Kauai from South America, the geographic source of many of the non-native plants in the Hawaiian Archipelago.

The present study has been carried out to examine the suitability of Kusheshwar-Asthan wetland's water for agriculture. Total 57 water samples were analyzed for various water quality parameters like electrical conductivity, pH, temperature, DO, major cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+), and major anions (PO43-, SO42-, N-NO3-, Cl-, HCO3-). Overall, the water of the wetland was found to be alkaline. The pre-monsoon samples had a relatively higher concentration in most of analyzed parameters except for pH, DO, NO3-, PO(4)(3- )and Cl-. The concentration of cations follows the order of Na+ > Ca2+> Mg2+ > K+ in both seasons and for anions it is HCO3- > SO42- > Cl- > NO3- > PO(4)(3-)for pre-monsoon and HCO3- > Cl- > SO42- > NO3- > PO(4)(3-)for post-monsoon. According to Piper diagram and Durov plot, Na-K-HCO3 was the major hydro-chemical facies of the surface water. The various irrigation quality parameters showed that wetland water falls in good to excellent quality. As a result, this finding can aid in the long-term sustainable use of the wetland water with regulated anthropogenic interventions. The study will be beneficial in designing longterm extensive management plans for the conservation of the wetland.					; Gupta, Deepak/AAW-3796-2021; ALAM, AFTAB/KBB-9870-2024	Gupta, Deepak/0000-0003-4695-0530; , Dr. Prashant/0000-0001-7459-9595													1606-9749	1607-0798				DEC	2022	22	12					8849	8879		10.2166/ws.2022.373	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/ws.2022.373		NOV 2022											WOS:000885071200001

Road Salt Impacts Freshwater Zooplankton at Concentrations below Current Water Quality Guidelines	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Widespread use of NaCl for road deicing has caused increased chloride concentrations in lakes near urban centers and areas of high road density. Chloride can be toxic, and water quality guidelines have been created to regulate it and protect aquatic life. However, these guidelines may not adequately protect organisms in low-nutrient, soft water lakes such as those underlain by the Precambrian Shield. We tested this hypothesis by conducting laboratory experiments on six Daphnia species using a soft water culture medium. We also examined temporal changes in cladoceran assemblages in the sediments of two small lakes on the Canadian Shield: one near a highway and the other >3 km from roads where salt is applied in the winter. Our results showed that Daphnia were sensitive to low chloride concentrations with decreased reproduction and increased mortality occurring between 5 and 40 mg Cl-/L. Analysis of cladoceran remains in lake sediments revealed changes in assemblage composition that coincided with the initial application of road salt in this region. In contrast, there were no changes detected in the remote lake. We found that 22.7% of recreational lakes in Ontario have chloride concentrations between 5 and 40 mg/L suggesting that cladoceran zooplankton in these lakes may already be experiencing negative effects of chloride.

The focus of this numerical investigation was to identify, on an intercontinental scale, the major sources of lindane that contributed to the contamination of North America and the Arctic. Both models simulated several strong episodic trans-Pacific atmospheric transport events of lindane from its sources in Asia to the western seaboard of North America. Modeling results also detected, for the first time, an important atmospheric pathway for persistent toxic substances from Western Africa/Western Europe to the Caribbean, the southern United States, and the eastern seaboard of North America. Several episodic lindane trans-Atlantic atmospheric transport events were found from May to October, These events were associated primarily with the easterly trade winds and the African easterly wave that extends from the subtropical eastern Atlantic to the Caribbean. This atmospheric pathway for toxic chemicals has a substantial implication for the level of toxic substances in North America. Atmospheric mechanisms contributing to these transport events are briefly discussed. Multiple modeling scenarios were studied to assess the contribution of lindane sources in Europe, Asia, and North America to its fate in the Arctic. Results show that these continental contributions are season-dependent with the highest contribution from Europe in the spring.

This year-long study in China's Taihu Lake Basin investigated the spatiotemporal distribution, environmental behavior, and ecological impacts of ECs in diverse aquatic systems. Key findings revealed strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity, with industrial areas exhibiting the highest EC concentrations (mean: 1888.28 ng/L), dominated by perfluorinated compound. Seasonal variations showed spring EC levels twice those of other seasons, linked to intensified industrial activity. Colloidal adsorption played a critical role in EC fate, contributing 0.74-45.48 % to pollutant distribution, particularly for antibiotics and bisphenols. A multidimensional prioritization framework integrating concentration, detection rate, colloidal adsorption, toxicity, persistence, and bioaccumulation identified nine priority ECs, including erythromycin, tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). ECs significantly disrupted plankton communities, with zooplankton diversity experiencing stronger suppression than phytoplankton, indicating trophic-level-dependent impacts. This study underscores the need for integrated monitoring strategies and regulatory thresholds to mitigate EC risks in complex aquatic ecosystems.					; Gao, Peng/AAE-2205-2019	Gao, Peng/0000-0002-4311-584X; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				JUL	2025	388								125965	10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.125965	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.125965								40446787					WOS:001502797300006

Jake Vander			Defining a Safe Operating Space for inland recreational fisheries	FISH AND FISHERIES												The Safe Operating Space (SOS) of a recreational fishery is the multidimensional region defined by levels of harvest, angler effort, habitat, predation and other factors in which the fishery is sustainable into the future. SOS boundaries exhibit trade-offs such that decreases in harvest can compensate to some degree for losses of habitat, increases in predation and increasing value of fishing time to anglers. Conversely, high levels of harvest can be sustained if habitat is intact, predation is low, and value of fishing effort is moderate. The SOS approach recognizes limits in several dimensions: at overly high levels of harvest, habitat loss, predation, or value of fishing effort, the stock falls to a low equilibrium biomass. Recreational fisheries managers can influence harvest and perhaps predation, but they must cope with trends that are beyond their control such as changes in climate, loss of aquatic habitat or social factors that affect the value of fishing effort for anglers. The SOS illustrates opportunities to manage harvest or predation to maintain quality fisheries in the presence of trends in climate, social preferences or other factors that are not manageable.					; Hansen, Gretchen/ABE-3860-2022; Carpenter, Stephen/AAQ-6404-2020; Perales, Kousei/F-6101-2016	Vander Zanden, Jake/0000-0002-8122-1416; Hansen, Gretchen/0000-0003-0241-7048; Perales, Kousei/0000-0003-3394-5716; Carpenter, Stephen/0000-0001-8097-8700													1467-2960	1467-2979				NOV	2017	18	6					1150	1160		10.1111/faf.12230	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/faf.12230													WOS:000413962500010

To evaluate the effects of dam construction on arsenic (As) mobility and transport in the ST River and the YT River in Tibet and the downstream river basins, water column and sediment core samples in the Shiquan Reservoir of the ST River and in the Zam Reservoir of the YT River were obtained in August 2017, and January and May 2018, and addition-ally, at the inflows and outfalls of the reservoirs. The seasonal variation of dissolved As contents in the inflow water of the Zam Reservoir and the Shiquan Reservoir was regulated by the mixing between the low-As river runoff and the high-As hot spring input. Water residence time (WRT) isa key variable regulating the variation of dissolved As contents in reservoirs and outflow waters with time. The absence of the oxic layer at the sediment-water interface reduced the accumulation of As in surface sediments under high-flow conditions. Ar-senic mobility in sediment of the two reservoirs was mainly controlled by Mn oxides and organic matter. Reser-voirs with long water residence time are more favorable for As retention. Sedimentation was the main mechanism of As retention. The Shiquan Reservoir with a longer WRT of 385 days can effectively retain 55% of the total arsenic load from upstream, while the Zam Reservoir has no effective retention of arsenic due to the very short WRT of 1.1 days. These have important implications on the geochemical and ecological environments of the downstream river basins. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The variabilities in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) over the two regions have been explored previously, but there have been few studies on the relationship of the NDVI in the two regions. Using the GIMMS-NDVI, GHCN-CAMS and NCEP reanalysis datasets and statistical and physical diagnostic methods, we show that the summer (June, July and August) NDVI over the eastern Tibetan Plateau and Lake Baikal and its adjacent eastern region of Siberia have an in-phase co-variability, especially on an interannual timescale (with a correlation coefficient of 0.69 during the time period 1982-2014). Further analyses show that precipitation and the related cloud cover and solar radiation are responsible for the variability in the NDVI over the eastern Tibetan Plateau, whereas temperature has the more important role in modulating the variability in the NDVI over the Lake Baikal region. A dipole pattern prevails over the Tibetan Plateau-Lake Baikal region and reflects the anomalies in the intensity and location of the South Asian high and the northeast Asian blocking high. This dipole pattern simultaneously modulates precipitation over the eastern Tibetan Plateau and the temperature over the Lake Baikal region and leads to the co-variability of the NDVI between the two regions. A synergistic sea surface temperature index, which reflects sea surface temperature anomalies in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, the northwest Pacific Ocean, the northern Indian Ocean and the subtropical north Atlantic Ocean, appears to adjust this Tibetan Plateau-Lake Baikal dipole pattern and is therefore closely related to the co-variability of the NDVI between the eastern Tibetan Plateau and the Lake Baikal region. Our results suggest that vegetation dynamics may not be only a local phenomenon in some areas, but are also likely to remotely link with variations in vegetation over other regions.																			1932-6203					OCT 28	2020	15	10							e0239465	10.1371/journal.pone.0239465	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239465								33112880					WOS:000588374000067

Orthophosphate addition during bench-scale tests reduced residual dissolved aluminum concentrations by as much as 350 mug/L. The tests involved adding alum and phosphate to Lake Michigan water followed by continuous mixing for up to 8 h. Analysis of filtered samples showed that orthophosphate addition reduced residual aluminum concentrations under all test conditions (pH 7.0-8.0, 4-31degreesC) except at the lowest temperature, at which aluminum concentrations fell below the detection limit. Orthophosphate loss to floc particles ranged from 22 to 85% of the amount dosed, with greater losses at the lowest pH value tested. Applying orthophosphate before rather than after adding alum resulted in greater phosphate loss to floc particles without improving aluminum removal.																			0003-150X					SEP	2004	96	9					99	109																WOS:000224082200015

We propose to use functional data analysis methods to extract the relevant information with respect to climate reconstruction from the rich but complex information in the varves, including the shapes of the seasonal patterns, the varying varve thickness, and the non-linear sediment accumulation rates. In particular we analyze varved sediment from lake Kassjon in northern Sweden, covering the past 6400 years. The properties of each varve reflect to a large extent weather conditions and internal biological processes in the lake the year that the varve was deposited. Functional clustering is used to group the seasonal patterns into different types, that can be associated with different weather conditions. The seasonal patterns were described by penalized splines and clustered by the k-means algorithm, after alignment.

The O2 demand of reduced species released from hypolimnetic sediments was dominated by methane, followed by ammonium and included minor contributions from Fe2+, Mn2+ and sulfide. Release of Fe and Mn from the sediments was apparently controlled by dissolution of siderite and rhodochrosite, with the requisite acidity for the dissolution provided by methanogenesis. Redox recycling of these 2 metals occurs in 2 vertically displaced wheels, which enhance oxidant delivery to the hypolimnion beyond that provided by O2 diffusion alone. P is tightly coupled to the ferrous wheel, in the absence of wind events, and is scavenged with a stoichiometry consistent with Tessenow''s laboratory studies.

This human intervention has divided the lake into northern and southern parts and caused an extreme disturbance in the hydro-chemical and hydrodynamic systems, namely current direction reversal. To fully understand the current situation, water depth and lake surface and deepwater physico-chemical parameters (i.e. density, temperature, acidity, electrical conductivity, and total dissolved solids) are analysed in the wet and dry seasons of 2019. In the wet season, deepwaters have a higher density than surface waters, and the northern part of the lake contains denser water compared to its southern counterpart. The formation of density gradients creates an anticlockwise direction lake current. Deepwaters show higher electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids than surface waters in the wet season. Unlike the wet season, the lake water becomes more homogenised due to wave action and evaporation in the dry season. Our study clearly demonstrates that the water passageway of the causeway does not allow for a complete yearly balance between water and sediment exchange. Results suggest that the northern and southern parts of the lake have almost independent hydro-chemical and hydrodynamic systems. In the undeniable reality of global warming trends, anthropogenic interventions into sensible ecologic systems need to be better planned if we were to prevent the ecological disasters we now have to face.					; Kaveh, Amaneh/JXY-2364-2024; Schwamborn, Georg/ABC-9636-2020; Lak, Razyeh/Y-3056-2019; Biltekin, Demet/AAB-3460-2020; Mohammadi, Ali/ABC-9603-2020; Schwamborn, Georg J/ABC-9636-2020	Kaveh, Amaneh/0000-0001-8039-1571; Mohammadi, Ali/0000-0003-2400-8392; Schwamborn, Georg J/0000-0001-9635-0539													1570-6443	1876-4444				MAR	2023	47						1	14		10.1016/j.jher.2023.03.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jher.2023.03.002		MAR 2023											WOS:000972684500001

Controls on the heterogeneity of soil respiration in a tolerant hardwood forest	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The spatial and temporal distribution of soil respiration (Rs) in forested landscapes and its control by environmental conditions and carbon pools has not been sufficiently investigated. A Rs monitoring strategy targeting different topographic features within a sugar maple forest on the Algoma Highlands on the Canadian Shield revealed that the critical transition zones (transiently wet areas adjacent to wetlands, streams, and lakes) yielded significantly larger Rs than adjacent upland or wetland portions of the catchment. Environmental conditions (soil temperature and soil moisture) explained the majority of variance in Rs. An exponential relationship in which the exponent is a polynomial expression that is linear with respect to temperature (degrees C) and quadratic with respect to moisture (% by volume) explained 57.0% of the variance in Rs (mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). However, inclusion of the quantity of carbon and substrate quality (carbon: nitrogen ratio) in the freshly fallen leaves, and the organic and/or mineral soils into the polynomial regression model explained an additional 15.3% of the variance in Rs (mmol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). This study highlighted the critical transition zone as major sites of Rs because of the synchronicity in optimal temperature and moisture conditions during the growing season and the large pool of high quality substrate that accumulates in topographic depositional areas.

The late quaternary Diego!Hernandez Formation, Tenerife:: Volcanology of a complex cycle of voluminous explosive phonolitic eruptions	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The Diego Hernandez Formation (DHF; 600-ca. 180 ka) represents the products of the most recent complete cycle of phonolitic explosive volcanism, on Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain). We provide a revised and detailed stratigraphy, new 40Ar/39Ar and (U-Th)/He age determinations for major eruptive units, a summary of new chemical data and an overview of the key characteristics of the cycle, including volume estimates, dispersal patterns, eruption styles, phreatomagmatic influences and caldera collapse episodes. The complex stratigraphy of the DHF is divided into 20 named members, each representing a major eruption, as well as numerous unnamed members of limited present-day exposure. The major eruptions are represented by the Fortaleza (370 ka), Roque (347 ka, 3 km(3)), Aldea (319 ka, 3 km(3)), Fasnia (309 ka, 13 km(3)), Poris (268 ka, 3.5 km(3)), Arafo (4 km(3)), Caleta (223 ka, 3.5 km(3)) and Abrigo (between 196 and 171 ka, 20 km(3)) Members. The Aldea, Fasnia and Poris Members consist of highly complex successions of plinian fall, surge and flow deposits and several of the eruptions produced widespread and internally complex ignimbrite sheets. Phreatomagmatism occurred most frequently in the opening phase of the eruptions but also recurred repeatedly throughout many of the sequences. Inferred sources of water include a shallow caldera lake and groundwater, and intermittent phreatomagmatic activity was an important influence on eruption style. Another important factor was conduit and vent instability, which frequently loaded the eruption column with dense lithic debris and occasionally triggered column collapse and ignimbrite formation. Most of the major DHF eruptions were triggered by injection of mafic magma into existing phonolitic magma bodies. Two phonolitic magma types were available for eruption during the lifetime of the DHF, but each was dominant at different times. The results presented here support a caldera collapse rather than a landslide model for the origin of the Las Canadas Caldera, although the evolution of the caldera is evidently more complex and incremental than first thought.

The year to year changes in the seasonal pattern and sequence of peak abundance of herbivore and predatory Crustacea and Rotifera were observed. Zooplankton in this lake showed also a distinct vertical distribution and more or less visible diel vertical migrations as well as the horizontal migration of Crustacea species between pelagial and near-shore zones of lake in summer period. The changes of demographic events like the decrease of mean body size of adults as well as decrease of fecundity along the inshore-offshore transect were also observed. This distinct habitat partition between crustaceans and rotifers can reflect a combined effect of food scarcity and predator pressure. Zooplankton of the shallow Lake Flosek is controlled by the complicate net of feed-back relations, resulting in a rather stable community structure which can explain its rather unsignificant changes in the period of about 20 years after the liming of water in this lake.

Structure and host-cell interaction of SH1, a membrane-containing, halophilic euryarchaeal virus	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The Archaea, and the viruses that infect them, are the least well understood of all of the three domains of life. They often grow in extreme conditions such as hypersaline lakes and sulfuric hot springs. Only rare glimpses have been gained into the structures of archaeal viruses. Here, we report the subnanometer resolution structure of a recently isolated, hypersalinic, membrane-containing, euryarchaeal virus, SH1, in which different viral proteins can be localized. The results indicate that SH1 has a complex capsid formed from single beta-barrels, an important missing link in hypotheses on viral capsid protein evolution. Unusual, symmetry-mismatched spikes seem to play a role in host adsorption. They are connected to highly organized membrane proteins providing a platform for capsid assembly and potential machinery for host infection.

J	Michelutti, N; Douglas, MSV; Smol, JP				Michelutti, N; Douglas, MSV; Smol, JP			Diatom response to recent climatic change in a high arctic lake (Char Lake, Cornwallis Island, Nunavut)	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												From 1968 to 1972, Char Lake (Resolute Bay, Cornwallis Island, Canadian High Arctic) was the site of a large-scale limnological study conducted under the auspices of the International Biological Programme. However, since that time, very little research has been done on the lake. We sampled Char Lake from 1992 to 2000 for a suite of physical, chemical, and biological variables. In general, there were no major differences between our water quality data and those collected 30 years earlier, showing that Char Lake is still oligotrophic, slightly alkaline, and dilute. However, a diatom-based paleolimnological analysis revealed that a subtle, yet distinct species assemblage shift has occurred beginning around 1987. The timing of this species shift does not correspond to the deposition of atmospherically transported persistent organic pollutants into the lake (beginning in the early 1950s) or to minor disturbances within its catchment (early 1970s). Instead, these subtle diatom changes are consistent with recent climatic changes during 1988-1997 (as documented by local meteorological measurements), and are likely related to reduced summer ice cover and a longer growing season.

Paleomagnetic record for the past 80 ka from the Mahanadi basin, Bay of Bengal	JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES												High resolution paleomagnetic investigations were performed on a 50.08 m long sediment core (MD161/20) from Mahanadi basin, Bay of Bengal. Core yielded reliable paleomagnetic results for top 20 m below seafloor (mbsf) which spans about 80 ka. Based on the analysis of rock magnetic data, the core is subdivided into five distinct Zones: Zone 1 and Zone 2 cover top 20 mbsf and do not show any abrupt change in magnetic mineralogy, concentration and grain size. Zones 3 and 5 show significant reduction in chi(LF), chi(ARM) and SIRM due to dissolution of magnetic minerals. Zone 4 shows moderate values of chi(LF) and SIRM. The low value of Mum suggests that magnetic signal is mostly carried by magnetic grains in PSD/MD state. The paleomagnetic data for the top 20 mbsf show four prominent geomagnetic excursions at similar to 9 mbsf, similar to 13.5 to 15 mbsf, similar to 16.3 mbsf and similar to 18 to 18.2 mbsf. The age-depth relationship is established using stratigraphic correlation between well-dated sedimentary core NGHP-01-19B and the core MD161/20. The ages of the observed excursions correspond to similar to 18 to 20 ka, similar to 42 to 49 ka, similar to 54 to 57 ka and similar to 69 to 70 ka. The excursions at similar to 42 to 49 ka, similar to 54 to 57 ka, and similar to 67 to 70 ka is similar to the known excursions the Laschamp and the split Norwegian-Greenland Sea events (NGS-I and NGSII). The excursion at 18-20 ka is not observed globally and may be related to lithological/sedimentological changes occurring during last glacial maxima (LGM). The virtual geomagnetic path (VGP) of Laschamp excursion traces clockwise loop. All excursions identified in present study fall in the periods of relatively low paleointensity.

G.; Janse, Jan H.; Chang, Manqi; Koehler, Jan; Hilt, Sabine			Modelling induced bank filtration effects on freshwater ecosystems to ensure sustainable drinking water production	WATER RESEARCH												Induced bank filtration (IBF) is a water abstraction technology using different natural infiltration systems for groundwater recharge, such as river banks and lake shores. It is a cost-effective pre-treatment method for drinking water production used in many regions worldwide, predominantly in urban areas. Until now, research concerning IBF has almost exclusively focussed on the purification efficiency and infiltration capacity. Consequently, knowledge about the effects on source water bodies is lacking. Yet, IBF interrupts groundwater seepage and affects processes in the sediment potentially resulting in adverse effects on lake or river water quality. Securing sufficient source water quality, however, is important for a sustainable drinking water production by IBF. In this study, we analysed the effects of five predicted mechanisms of IBF on shallow lake ecosystems using the dynamic model PCLake: declining CO2 and nutrient availability, as well as increasing summer water temperatures, sedimentation rates and oxygen penetration into sediments. Shallow lake ecosystems are abundant worldwide and characterised by the occurrence of alternative stable states with either clear water and macrophyte dominance or turbid, phytoplankton-dominated conditions. Our results show that IBF in most scenarios increased phytoplankton abundance and thus had adverse effects on shallow lake water quality. Threshold levels for critical nutrient loading inducing regime shifts from clear to turbid conditions were up to 80% lower with IBF indicating a decreased resilience to eutrophication. The effects were strongest when IBF interrupted the seepage of CO2 rich groundwater resulting in lower macrophyte growth. IBF could also enhance water quality, but only when interrupting the seepage of groundwater with high nutrient concentrations. Higher summer water temperatures increased the share of cyanobacteria in the phytoplankton community and thus the risk of toxin production. In relative terms, the effects of changing sedimentation rates and oxygen penetration were small. Lake depth and size influenced the effect of IBF on critical nutrient loads, which was strongest in shallower and smaller lakes. Our model results stress the need of a more comprehensive ecosystem perspective including an assessment of !BF effects on threshold levels for regime shifts to prevent high phytoplankton abundance in the source water body and secure a sustainable drinking water supply.

Holocene summer temperature reconstruction from plant sedaDNA and chironomids from the northern boreal forest	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Climate-induced ecotonal shifts are expected to occur in the (sub)arctic and boreal zones in the coming decades. Understanding how these ecosystems have previously responded to climate change can provide greater insight into how ecosystems may develop under existing and future pressures. Here we present a Holocene record from Lake Horntjernet, a lake on the northern edge of the boreal forest in Northern Norway. We show vegetation development and landscape dynamics typical for Northern Fennoscandia during the Holocene. A plant sedaDNA record indicates rapid vegetation development following deglaciation with early arrival of Betula trees/shrubs. Pine forest was established by c. 8500 cal yr BP, and subsequent mid- to late Holocene vegetation assemblages are relatively stable. The aquatic ecosystem community is indicative of climatic change during the early Holocene, while strong coupling with changes in the catchment vegetation affects the water quality during the midand late Holocene. The chironomid record indicates lake water acidification following the establishment of pine forest and heathland. Different approaches for temperature reconstruction are calculated and the results are compared to better understand ecosystem-climate relationships and ecosystem resilience to climate change. Chironomid-inferred temperatures indicate early Holocene warming and late Holocene cooling, comparable to independent regional temperature trends. However, lake acidification impedes reliable reconstruction of chironomid-inferred temperatures in the mid-Holocene, a trend recognised in other boreal chironomid records. The application of sedaDNA plant-inferred summer temperature reconstruction is inhibited by the persistence of cold and warm tolerant species within the boreal pine forest. However, a trait-based approach reconstructed temperature trends that aligned with independent regional data. Thus, here we demonstrate the value of combined molecular and fossil-based proxies for elucidating the complex response of a boreal catchment to climate change.

Variability of the useful life of reservoirs in tropical locations: A case study from the Burdekin Falls Dam, Australia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH												Large dam construction for irrigation, hydropower, water supply, and flood control in tropical to subtropical areas increased markedly after 1950. Many of the dams built during this period have filled with sediment and no longer perform to their original design specifications; in many cases, forecast dam life was greatly overestimated. This study investigates the useful life of Burdekin Falls Dam (BFD), northeastern Australia and compares the findings with other tropical reservoirs. Using two independent methods it is estimated that between 61 and 65 million m3 of sediment has been deposited in the reservoir over the 24 years of operation through 2011. This sediment volume equates to an average of 0.15% of capacity lost per year since construction was completed. If current sediment loads/climate regimes persist, reservoir capacity will be reduced by 50% after 345 years. However, the useful life of the BFD reduces to just 276 years when drawdown data are considered; these data show reservoir use would be affected once 40% of storage was filled with sediment, with a 60% drawdown return period of 1 in 15 years. When compared to similar large tropical to sub-tropical reservoirs, the BFD has a slightly longer reservoir useful life than dams in India and a much longer half-life than for both similar-sized and larger dams in China, Brazil, and Iran. Properties of the BFD that promote a longer useful life include a lower trap efficiency, relatively low annual sediment load delivered to the reservoir, limited sediment deposition behind the dam wall (and uniform distribution of deposited sediment), and the export of highly turbid annual floodwaters before settling and deposition of any remaining sediment within the reservoir.

Determination of Poly-β-hydroxyalkanoate in Peat	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS												Poly-beta-hydroxyalkanoate (PHA) is a prokaryotic energy reserve material that has been used as an indicator of environmental stress in aquatic bacteria. The following technique has been used to quantify PHA in peatland microorganisms. Peat samples were dried, digested in sulphuric acid to convert PHA into crotonic acid, and the resulting acid determined using organic acid high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultraviolet (UV) detection at 214 nm. This technique is suggested to have potential value as an indicator of environmental stress on peatland microorganisms, such as that caused by summer drought, or changes in soil nutrient availability, which are predicted consequences of climatic change.

J	Laird, NF; Desrochers, J; Payer, M				Laird, Neil F.; Desrochers, Jared; Payer, Melissa			Climatology of Lake-Effect Precipitation Events over Lake Champlain	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												This study provides the first long-term climatological analysis of lake-effect precipitation events that developed in relation to a small lake (having a surface area of <= 1500 km(2)). The frequency and environmental conditions favorable for Lake Champlain lake-effect precipitation were examined for the nine winters (October-March) from 1997/98 through 2005/06. Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) data from Burlington, Vermont, were used to identify 67 lake-effect events. Events occurred as 1) well-defined, isolated lake-effect bands over and downwind of the lake, independent of larger-scale precipitating systems (LC events), 2) quasi-stationary lake-effect bands over the lake embedded within extensive regional precipitation from a synoptic weather system (SYNOP events), or 3) a transition from SYNOP and LC lake-effect precipitation. The LC events were found to occur under either a northerly or a southerly wind regime. An examination of the characteristics of these lake-effect events provides several unique findings that are useful for comparison with known lake-effect environments for larger lakes. January was the most active month with an average of nearly four lake-effect events per winter, and approximately one of every four LC events occurred with southerly winds. Event initiation and dissipation occurred on a diurnal time scale with an average duration of 12.1 h. In general, Lake Champlain lake-effect events 1) typically yielded snowfall, with surface air temperatures rarely above 0 degrees C, 2) frequently had an overlake mesolow present with a sea level pressure departure of 3-5 hPa, 3) occurred in a very stable environment with a surface inversion frequently present outside the Lake Champlain Valley, and 4) averaged a surface lake-air temperature difference of 14.4 degrees C and a lake-850-hPa temperature difference of 18.2 degrees C. Lake Champlain lake-effect events occur within a limited range of wind and temperature conditions, thus providing events that are more sensitive to small changes in environmental conditions than are large-lake lake-effect events and offering a more responsive system for subsequent investigation of connections between mesoscale processes and climate variability.																			1558-8424					FEB	2009	48	2					232	250		10.1175/2008JAMC1923.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2008JAMC1923.1													WOS:000264939800004

Same-day Enterococcus qPCR results of recreational water quality at two Toronto beaches provide added public health protection and reduced beach days lost	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SANTE PUBLIQUE												ObjectivesWe evaluated the potential impacts from using a rapid same-day quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) monitoring method for beach posting outcomes at two Toronto beaches.MethodsIn total, 228 water samples were collected at Marie Curtis Park East and Sunnyside Beaches over the 2021 summer season. Water samples were processed using the USEPA 1609.1 Enterococcus qPCR-based method. Escherichia coli (E. coli) culture data and daily beach posting decisions were obtained from Toronto Public Health.ResultsNo significant correlation was observed between previous-day and same-day (retrospective) E. coli enumeration results at any Sunnyside Beach transect, and only relatively low (R = 0.41-0.56) or no significant correlation was observed at sampling transects for Marie Curtis Park East Beach. Comparing our same-day Enterococcus qPCR data to Toronto's 2-day E. coli geometric mean beach posting decisions, we noted the need for additional postings for 1 (2%) and 3 (8%) missed health-risk days at Sunnyside and Marie Curtis Park East Beaches, respectively. The qPCR data also pointed to incorrect postings for 12 (31%) and 6 (16%) lost beach days at Sunnyside and Marie Curtis Park East Beaches, respectively.ConclusionApplication of a rapid Enterococcus qPCR method at two Toronto beaches revealed 5% of beach posting decisions were false negatives that missed health-risk days, while 23% of decisions were false positives resulting in lost beach days. Deployment of the rapid same-day qPCR method offers the potential to reduce both health risks and unnecessary beach postings.

Combined gel probes for the in situ determination of dissolved reactive phosphorus in porewaters and characterization of sediment reactivity	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Diffusive equilibrium in thin films (DET) and diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) were applied in situ to obtain high spatial resolution dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) sediment porewater profiles in two lagoons of the Gippsland Lakes (SE Australia) during summer. Although the DRP depth profiles were different in each lake, highlighting the sensitivity of DRP to the redox state of the sediment, spatial DRP variations obtained from DET and DGT showed striking similarities with depth in each lake. Comparison of DRP concentrations obtained from DGT and DET allows an assessment of the reactivity of the sediment. A dynamic numerical model of DGT-induced flux in sediments (DIFS) quantified reactivity kinetics. Sediment response time (T-c) related to sedimentary phosphorus resupply resulting from DGT-induced lowering of the porewater DRP concentration was calculated. Values of Tc ranged from 4128 to 183 400 s and from 55 to 149 400 s for Lakes Victoria and Wellington, respectively. These results indicate the limited capacity of the sediment to quickly resupply DRP to the porewater, especially in surface sediment, which was always characterized by the highest Tc. Adsorption and desorption rate constants were also calculated from DIFS with values ranging from 2 x 10(-3) to 2 x 10(-2) day(-1) and from 0.3 to 21 day(-1) for Lake Victoria and from 2 x 10(-4) to 0.8 day(-1) and from 0.6 to 1558 day(-1) for Lake Wellington, respectively. Diffusive fluxes estimated from the in situ DRP gradient at the sediment-water interface by DET were 558 and 1.2 mu mol m(-2) day(-1) in lakes Victoria and Wellington, respectively. Despite only a single measurement, these fluxes highlight a substantial contribution of P from the sediment to the water column in summer for Lake Victoria which is likely to contribute to the recurring blooms of blue-green algae. These calculated fluxes obtained with minimal sediment disturbance and high spatial resolution were substantially different (by a factor of 6-180) from other reported values using more conventional quantitative assessments such as diffusive fluxes (from core slicing) and benthic chambers.					; Kolev, Spas/L-5719-2016	Worsfold, Paul/0000-0002-2262-7723; McKelvie, Ian/0000-0003-1199-180X													0013-936X	1520-5851				JUL 15	2008	42	14					5112	5117		10.1021/es8001663	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es8001663								18754356					WOS:000257620000017

Thanks to new technologies, oil exploration in the arctic environment takes a great steps in 3D seismic acquisition methods passing from cable recording equipment and the dependence of sensor connectivity to a recording center and replacing this system with a very versatile system of wireless receivers units equipped with GPS positioning and time stamp recording and storing the seismic data "in situ". This new technology has allowed a high unit count of light receivers to operate in extreme conditions, which in the past was practically impossible given the limitations of the logistical support to carry out this type of operations in remote and difficult access areas. Definitely this technological development has allowed Repsol to explore a larger surface area in a single winter season acquiring high resolution seismic data that allows obtaining high quality images with better geophysical attributes. Seismic sources have also undergone a notable evolution through the use of high productivity techniques of vibrating trucks moving from a set of multiple vibrators to a single vibrator emission getting up to date simultaneous source acquisitions which allows recording more information without waiting for a second set of vibrators or single vibroseis truck to start shaking to emit energy to the ground. The ability to vibrate at the same time with many sets of single vibrators allows operation on frozen sea either with grounded ice or vibrating on floating ice expanding the exploration boundary to the open sea zones. The new technology has made it possible for Repsol to improve the operational capability of the crew without increasing the number of people or increasing the logistical support required to operate in remote and difficult access areas. This technological advance has allowed the improvement of the quality of oil exploration using 3D seismic techniques reducing the price per recorded trace or per surface source, increasing the possibility to acquire larger surfaces and better seismic data in a single winter season window. More importantly, these technologies have allowed affordable oil exploration with a high respect for the communities, the wildlife and the environment.																			2153-4772		978-0-7918-5129-6				2018									V008T11A015															WOS:000449724500053

Spatio-temporal shifts of macroinvertebrate drift and benthos in headwaters of a retreating glacier	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Recent alpine stream studies have aimed to predict biotic responses to changing environmental conditions, hydrological regime and climate, but there is little information on macroinvertebrate drift shifts in this context and most research was largely restricted to snow-free period. We compared seasonal drift-benthos patterns in proglacial streams of Val Roseg (Switzerland) between 2008/2009 and 1997/1998. Samples were collected monthly (including winter) in a glacial lake outlet stream, a proglacial stream, and their post-confluence stream (main channel) in both periods. Measured physical and chemical parameters indicated the largest glacial meltwater influence in the proglacial stream and its lower inflow in 2008/2009 compared to 1997/1998. Drift largely coincided with benthic structure at each site, although drift-benthos patterns were at times asynchronous, depending on site and flow conditions. Our results indicate that the initial stages of hydrological "freeze-melt" events and the period of snow cover are most favorable for macroinvertebrates in glacial streams. Drift density was significantly lower in 2008/2009 than in 1997/1998. In 2008/2009, we observed lower chironomid, but higher ephemeropteran and plecopteran drift densities. The drift-benthos changes between periods likely reflect behavioral and life-history responses of proglacial stream macroinvertebrates to seasonal shifts in environmental conditions in response to glacial retreat.

Trends in nutrients, phytoplankton, and chloride in nearshore waters of Lake Ontario: Synchrony and relationships with physical conditions	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Consistent routine monitoring at four municipal water treatment plant intakes revealed dramatic long-term Changes in water quality in the nearshore waters of Lake Ontario over the last three decades. Total P concentrations decreased significantly, but concentrations leveled off at around 0.01 mg/L after 1996. Silica (Si) and nitrate + nitrite-N (NO2 (+) (3)) concentrations increased and chloride concentrations decreased until the mid-1990s after which they began to increase. There were significant decreasing trends in chlorophyll a and algal cell densities, the greatest rate of decrease being observed in diatom abundance. Interannual and seasonal variations in all parameters were synchronous between stations, indicating the influence of drivers such as climate and hydrology operating at a broad scale. The interannual variations in NO2 + 3 and Si concentrations were significantly related to snow depth, and in Si were also related to annual climate indices, the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI) and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), the two most dominant large-scale atmospheric circulation models controlling climate in large parts of the northern hemisphere. The relationships indicated that Si concentrations were lower in the milder, drier years and higher when winters were colder and precipitation and snow depth were greater.

Quantifying sedimentation patterns of small landslide-dammed lakes in the central Oregon Coast Range	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Understanding sedimentation patterns in small coastal watersheds due to landscape perturbations is critical for connecting hillslope and fluvial processes, in addition to managing aquatic habitats for anadromous fish and other aquatic species in the Oregon Coast Range (OCR). Changes in sedimentation patterns spanning the last 250 years are preserved in two landslide-dammed lakes in small watersheds (< 10 km(2)) underlain by the Tyee Formation in the central OCR. Dendrochronology of drowned Douglas-fir stumps in both lakes provided precise timing of the damming and formation of the lakes, with Klickitat Lake forming in winter ad 1751/52 and Wasson Lake in winter ad 1819/20. Perturbations from wildfires, logging and road development, and previously underappreciated snow events affect sedimentation rates in the lakes to different degrees, and are identified in the sediment record using cesium-137 (Cs-137), high-resolution charcoal stratigraphy, local fire records, and aerial photography. Each lake has variable sedimentation accumulation rates (0.05-4.4 cm yr(-1)) and mass accumulation rates (0.02-1.42 g cm(-2) yr(-1)). Sedimentation rates remained low from the landslide-damming events until the mid-19th century, when they increased following stand-replacing wildfires. Aside from a sediment remobilization triggered by human modification of the landslide dam at Klickitat Lake around 1960, the largest peaks in mass accumulation rates in the mid-20th century at both lakes in the early 1950s precede major road construction and logging activity in the watersheds. Subsequent sedimentation rates are lower, but variable, and possible effects of logging and road development might be exacerbated by abnormal precipitation and heavy snow events. A comparison of previous studies of landslide-dammed lakes in larger watershed of the OCR are consistent with our findings of increased sedimentation in the mid-20th century, as well as higher sedimentation rates in the debris-flow dominated southern Tyee Formation than in the lower-relief northern Tyee Formation.					; WALSH, MEGAN/GWC-2042-2022	Wetherell, Logan/0000-0002-6716-3790; Struble, William/0000-0002-8163-5088; Roering, Joshua/0000-0003-0647-3338													0197-9337	1096-9837				JUN 15	2021	46	7					1375	1392		10.1002/esp.5106	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/esp.5106		MAR 2021											WOS:000634566900001

Stabilization is facilitated by compensatory motion of the sophisticated avian head neck system. While relative head motion has been studied in stationary and walking birds, little is known about how birds accomplish head stabilization during flapping flight. To unravel this, we approximate the avian neck with a linear mass spring damper system for vertical displacements, analogous to proven head stabilization models for walking humans. We corroborate the model's dimensionless natural frequency and damping ratios from highspeed video recordings of whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus) flying over a lake. The data show that flap-induced body oscillations can be passively attenuated through the neck. We find that the passive model robustly attenuates large body oscillations, even in response to head mass and gust perturbations. Our proof of principle shows that bird-inspired drones with flapping wings could record better images with a swan-inspired passive camera suspension.

Temporal and spatial variations in phytoplankton productivity in surface waters of a warm-temperate, monomictic lake in New Zealand	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Surface phytoplankton productivity measurements were carried out in morphologically complex Lake Rotoiti with the objective of defining variations between sites and seasons, and the dominant environmental drivers of these variations. Measurements were carried out monthly at two depths at each of three morphologically diverse stations for 1 year throughout the lake. Productivity at the surface of the shallow embayment was significantly higher in most months of the year compared with the surface of the other two stations but there were no significant differences from September to December 2004. There were no relationships between measured environmental variables and primary productivity or specific production. Inorganic nutrient concentrations at the surface of the shallow station were low throughout the whole year but at the other two stations they showed a typical pattern for monomictic lakes of higher levels during winter mixing and declining concentrations during thermal stratification. The high variability between sites found in this study indicates that it is important to account for local differences in productivity in morphologically diverse lakes, and that whole lake productivity estimates may vary greatly depending on the location and depth of productivity measurements.

In this study, water samples were collected to detect the antibiotic resistance of heterotrophic bacteria to five antibiotics, and the content, phenotype, gene type and species distribution of resistant bacteria were analyzed. The results showed that the changes of bacteria resistance rate in 2 lakes to 5 kinds of antibiotics were synchronous with time, and it would reach its maximum in autumn. The detection of ARGs and int I in 80 resistance strains showed that the detection rate of tetG, tetA and int I was high. 51.25% of the bacteria were double-resistance to AMP-CTX. The 80 isolate strains were of 9 genera and 19 species, among which Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Aeromonas veronii, Aeromonas caviae and Raoultella ornithinolytica were the common ARB species in 2 lakes. Correlation analysis showed that the water temperature was significantly correlated with the content of ARB in SMZ and CTX (p < 0.05), and the TP in FQ lake was significantly correlated with the content of AMP resistant bacteria (p < 0.05), while there were no other correlations between the changes of other water quality indexes and the content of ARB (p > 0.05).

Urban carbon dioxide cycles within the Salt Lake Valley: A multiple-box model validated by observations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												A multiple-box model was developed to determine how meteorological, anthropogenic, and biological processes combine to produce diel cycles of carbon dioxide (CO2) mole fraction during each of the four calendar-based seasons within Salt Lake Valley, Utah, USA. The model was forced by observed winds, sounding-derived mixing depths, an anthropogenic CO2 emissions inventory, and net biological flux estimates based on temperature, solar radiation, and ecosystem type. The model was validated using hourly CO2 mole fractions measured at five sites in the urban Salt Lake Valley (uSLV) area for 2005-2009 (spatial average of observations denoted by C-obs). The model accounted for 53% of C-obs on an hourly basis, and accounted for 90-94% of the mean diel cycle of C-obs depending on season. The multiple-box model results indicated that CO2 change rates within the uSLV mean diel cycles were largely the result of imbalances between anthropogenic processes adding CO2 and meteorological processes removing or diluting CO2. Removal by wind (advection) was the most important CO2 reduction process on average, but dilution of CO2 by entrainment of air from above the mixing height overtook advection in importance between sunrise and midday. During summer mornings, CO2 reduction attributable to photosynthesis below shallow mixing heights was of intermediate importance between advection and entrainment, but the overall net effect of biological processes was the least important influence on CO2 change rates during each of the four seasons.

J	Rautio, A; Korkka-Niemi, K				Rautio, Anne; Korkka-Niemi, Kirsti			Chemical and isotopic tracers indicating groundwater/surface-water interaction within a boreal lake catchment in Finland	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Stable isotopes (delta O-18, delta D), dissolved silica (DSi) concentration and major ion composition were used to indicate groundwater/surface-water interaction between the aquifers, the rivers and a lake in the high-latitude Lake Pyhajarvi catchment in Finland. Significant differences were recorded in water chemistry between the groundwater and surface waters, especially in the stable isotope composition and DSi concentrations, which could thus be used as tracers. The baseline data on isotopic patterns and hydrogeochemistry in the hydrological cycle were provided by a 1-year monitoring survey in this snow-type catchment area. The proportions of groundwater in the rivers, the lake inshore area and in a groundwater abstraction plant were calculated using stable isotopes and DSi. Two inflowing rivers had distinct differences in their water chemistry. DSi has potential as a tracer in the river environment, whereas stable isotopes were more applicable in the lake environment. Locally, near the shoreline, the effect of discharging groundwater on the lake-water quality could clearly be observed. Furthermore, infiltration of the lake water into the aquifer could be observed near the pumping wells onshore. This infiltration presents a potential risk for the water quality of water supply (intake) wells. Frequent sampling is needed as part of the evaluation of the level of groundwater/surface-water interaction in snow-type catchments in order to estimate the magnitude of seasonal variation. In groundwater/surface-water interaction studies, spring thaw and high-precipitation events could be problematic, in terms of both sampling and interpreting results.

J	Yang, F; Maguire, RJ				Yang, F; Maguire, RJ			Occurrence and seasonal variation of tributyltin in marinas on Lake Ontario, Canada	WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA												A survey of five marinas and one reference site on Lake Ontario, Canada, was conducted to investigate the occurrence and variation of tributyltin (TBT) levels in water between April and December of 1998. The survey results revealed the presence as well as seasonal trends of TBT in these marinas. The TBT concentrations in water were found to coincide with boating activity. The level of TBT generally rose in summer when the boating activity was high, and the highest level of TBT found was 14 ng Sn/L. On average, 92% of the TBT was in the operationally defined "dissolved phase" in the waters analyzed. The butyltin compounds were also found in surface sediment and paint chips from some non-aluminum hulled pleasure boats, with total concentrations of butyltin species (including dibutyltin and monobutyltin) ranging from 59 to 570 mu g Sn/g dry weight, and from 0 to 146 pg Sn/g, respectively. The results clearly indicated that TBT in the marina waters primarily originated from antifouling paint on pleasure boats, even though the use of TBT as an antifouling agent was regulated in 1989.																			1201-3080						2000	35	4					681	691		10.2166/wqrj.2000.037	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wqrj.2000.037													WOS:000089755700004

(Bacillariophyceae), a New Araphid Diatom from Sihailongwan Maar Lake, Northeastern China	WATER												A new species, Fragilaria longwania sp. nov. from Sihailongwan Maar Lake in northeastern China is described on the basis of observations made using light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) that reveal the distinctive features that separate this new taxon from the other species currently placed in the genus Fragilaria. Fragilaria longwania sp. nov. has relatively short valve length, high stria density, spindle-shaped valves with a swollen, and sometimes deformed central area and capitate valve apices, short spines and weakly developed apical pore fields. This combination of character was found to be unique when the new species was compared with morphologically similar taxa. This species was found in various samples collected from Sihailongwan Maar Lake between 2003 and 2017. The analysis of the diatom assemblages collected in the sediment trap samples allowed an assessment of the cell size variation, seasonal occurrences and ecological requirements of this species. Fragilaria longwania appears to be a planktonic diatom most often associated with the spring season.																				2073-4441				SEP 29	2025	17	19							2843	10.3390/w17192843	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17192843													WOS:001593385500001
J	Chen, W; Liu, DM; Dong, L; Zhang, KM				Chen, Wei; Liu, Dameng; Dong, Li; Zhang, Keming			Sequence filling patterns and petroleum implications of Lower Cretaceous series in South Tamtsag Depression	ENERGY EXPLORATION & EXPLOITATION												Sequence stratigraphic study of Lower Cretaceous strata in the South Tamtsag Depression of Mongolia identifies one second-order and four third-order sequences. These sequences are controlled by syndepositional fault activities at the slope-break zone of the lacustrine basin. At the initial rift stage of the basin, creation of accommodation space outpaced sediment accumulation and the lake level fell below the structural slope-break zone. Sequences formed in this stage can be divided into lowstand, transgressive and highstand system tracts. At the main rift stage, lake level did not fall below the structural slope-break zone and sequences formed in this stage consist of transgressive and regressive system tracts. Vertical stacking patterns within sequences are expressed by cyclic occurrences of alluvial fan, fan delta and delta deposits in the gentle slope belt located in the western part of the basin, and fan delta, nearshore subaqueous fan and lake deposits in the steep slope belt in the eastern part of the basin. The distribution of sandstone units in the sequences, which are the major target reservoirs, can be easily recognized through the combination of sedimentology analysis and interpretation of seismic reflection profiles. The slope-break zone of the lacustrine basin, which can be identified from seismic reflection profiles, played critical roles on the thickness and lateral extension of the sandbodies in the basin, and thus is the main controlling factor of petroleum reservoirs in the basin. Because mudstone and oil shale developed during the transgressive system tracts are hydrocarbon source rocks and cap rocks, deltaic sandstone units and incision channel fills are the most important petroleum reservoirs in the Tamtsag basin. Finally, this paper divides four types of subtle traps according to the petroleum accumulation model for future exploration.

Prevalence of bacterial infections was similar in the two rodent communities, with one leading host species in each habitat (46.3% in Apodemus flavicollis versus 29.1% in Myodes glareolus in forest, or 36.9% in Microtus arvalis versus 13.7% in Mi. oeconomus in grassland). Prevalence/abundance of infections varied markedly across the 3 years with 2006 being the year of highest prevalence and abundance. Infections were more common during autumn months in My. glareolus and A. flavicollis, and in juvenile and young adult (age classes 1 and 2) My. glareolus and Mi. oeconomus than in adults (age class 3). Higher prevalence and abundance of Bartonella infections were found in male A. flavicollis in comparison to females. These data are discussed in relation to the parasite genotypes identified in this region and with respect to the role of various ecological factors influencing Bartonella spp. infections in naturally infected host populations.					; Welc-Faleciak, Renata/JGE-3494-2023; Behnke, Jerzy/L-6176-2015	Bajer, Anna/0000-0001-6199-8458; Welc-Faleciak, Renata/0000-0003-2266-1435; 													0031-1820	1469-8161				JUN	2010	137	7					1069	1077		10.1017/S0031182009992058	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182009992058								20388232					WOS:000279156600003
J	Marcar, GP				Marcar, G. P.			The Quiet Lake and the Hidden Spring: Locating the Ground in Kierkegaard's Works of Love	STUDIES IN CHRISTIAN ETHICS												At the end of the prayer with which he begins Works of Love (1847), Soren Kierkegaard notes that while 'works of love' might normally be viewed as a subset of worthwhile human endeavours or 'works', from heaven's perspective no work can be pleasing unless it is a work of love. From this arises the question-which Kierkegaard himself moves swiftly to address-of what distinguishes a work of 'love' from other, non-loving works? In this article, and with particular reference to Jacob Boehme (1575-1624), I highlight how Kierkegaard's answer to this question draws upon the theological tradition that Bernard McGinn has called 'the mysticism of the ground'.

J	Smith, L; Watzin, MC; Druschel, G				Smith, Lydia; Watzin, Mary C.; Druschel, Gregory			Relating sediment phosphorus mobility to seasonal and diel redox fluctuations at the sediment-water interface in a eutrophic freshwater lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Relationships between phosphorus cycling and redox conditions in the sediments of eutrophic Missisquoi Bay, Lake Champlain were investigated over diel and seasonal timescales in three consecutive summers (2007-2009), one of which (2007) did not experience a cyanobacteria bloom for the first time in a decade. Sediment extraction data showed that reactive phosphorus (RP) is strongly correlated to reactive iron (RFe), suggesting that the mobility of a large portion (30-40%) of the total sediment phosphorus pool is associated with nanocrystalline iron oxide minerals that may be influenced by redox conditions. RP concentrations in the top sediments increased throughout 2007 but decreased throughout 2008; calculations indicate that similar to 1 mm of sediment could account for the increased total dissolved phosphorus observed in overlying water. Redox conditions were measured over 24 h in situ within sediment cores and at the sediment-water interface (SWI) at different stages of each season using voltammetry. SWI redox conditions became progressively more reduced across the season and overnight and were significantly more reducing in the presence of a bloom. Soluble RP and cyanobacteria cell counts measured at five depths through the water column strongly correlated with the most reducing conditions at the SWI. Observations suggest that redox controlled nutrient flux between the sediments and the water column is variable over diel and seasonal cycles. Cyanobacteria blooms most significantly affect SWI redox conditions, suggesting that blooms may enhance RP flux from sediments, setting up a positive feedback loop that can propagate and sustain blooms in shallow freshwater systems.

Here we examine the Holocene history of the European forest steppe ecotone in the lower Danube Plain to better understand its sensitivity to climate fluctuations, fire and human impact, and the timing of its transition into a cultural forest steppe. We used multi-proxy analyses (pollen, n-alkanes, coprophilous fungi, charcoal and geochemistry) of a 6000-year sequence from Lake Oltina (southeastern Romania) combined with a REVEALS (Regional Estimates of Vegetation Abundance from Large Sites) model of quantitative vegetation cover. We found a greater tree cover, composed of xerothermic (Carpinus orientalis and Quercus) and temperate (Carpinus betulus, Tilia, Ulmus and Fraxinus) tree taxa, between 6000 and 2500 cal yr BP. Maximum tree cover (similar to 50 %), dominated by C. orientalis occurred between 4200 and 2500 cal yr BP at a time of wetter climatic conditions and moderate fire activity. Compared to other European forest steppe areas, the dominance of C. orientalis represents the most distinct feature of the woodland's composition at this time. Tree loss was underway by 2500 yr BP (Iron Age), with the REVEALS model indicating a fall to similar to 20 % tree cover from the Late Holocene forest maximum, linked to clearance for agriculture, while climate conditions remained wet. Biomass burning increased markedly at 2500 cal yr BP, suggesting that fire was regularly used as a management tool until 1000 cal yr BP when woody vegetation became scarce. A sparse tree cover, with only weak signs of forest recovery, then became a permanent characteristic of the lower Danube Plain, highlighting more or less continuous anthropogenic pressure. The timing of anthropogenic ecosystem transformation here (2500 cal yr BP) falls between that in central-eastern (between 3700 and 3000 cal yr BP) and eastern (after 2000 cal yr BP) Europe. Our study is the first quantitative land cover estimate at the forest steppe ecotone in southeastern Europe spanning 6000 years. It provides critical empirical evidence that, at a broad spatial scale, the present-day forest steppe and woodlands reflect the potential natural vegetation in this region under current climate conditions. However, the extent of tree cover and its composition have been neither stable in time nor shaped solely by the climate. Consequently, vegetation change must be seen as dynamic and reflecting wider changes in environmental conditions including natural disturbances and human impact.

The community structure in biofilms was different from that in the lake water throughout the seasons and years. The community structure in lake water was similar in the same seasons of different years, corresponding to similar environmental factors (i.e., temperature, dissolved oxygen, and light intensity) and nutrient ion concentrations at the same season. However, the community structure in the biofilms was not similar in the same season of different years. This seems to be due to the formation of new biofilms on sprouted reeds in every early summer and the high nutrient concentrations and bacterial density in subsequently formed biofilms. Although the community structure in the biofilms changed along with the seasonal change, the bacteria belonging to Bacillus and Paenibacillus were detected in any season. This study revealed the possibility that the bacterial community structure in the initial stage of the biofilm formation govern the subsequent seasonal change of the community structure in biofilms.																			1342-6311					JUN 1	2011	26	2					113	119		10.1264/jsme2.ME10183	http://dx.doi.org/10.1264/jsme2.ME10183								21502742					WOS:000291167500002

The lake is regarded as a flow-through lake during average to wet weather conditions with a large catchment making the lake groundwater-dominated. Monitoring of delta O-18 in mini-piezometers in the lake bed and wells at the lake shore and in the catchment was used to investigate changes in groundwater-lake interaction as a result of three years with below-average precipitation (2009-2011). It is demonstrated that the lake experienced a flow reversal, where the lake switched to being mainly a recharge lake during this period, before returning to a flow-through lake in early 2012. The observations correlate well with observed changes in hydraulic gradients. A 2D groundwater flow and transport model was used to simulate this natural tracer experiment in order to evaluate the extent and timing of the flow reversal as well as supply information during periods, where there were no delta 18O and hydraulic head data. The results show that delta 18O is a robust tracer for tracking the extent of flow reversals. Furthermore, time series of hydraulic heads (2007-2013) demonstrate that the lake experienced short-lived annual flow reversals typically during late summer.					; Pedersen, Ole/F-2476-2011; Duque, Carlos/AAA-6410-2020	Hajati, Mithra-Christin/0000-0002-9732-0021; Pedersen, Ole/0000-0002-0827-946X; Duque, Carlos/0000-0001-5833-8483; Frandsen, Mette/0000-0002-3350-1392													0075-9511	1873-5851				JAN	2018	68				SI		26	35		10.1016/j.limno.2017.04.006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2017.04.006													WOS:000428014700004

Nevertheless, the relative importance of environmental drivers connected to WLF may be completely different, depending on the typology and use of waterbodies, latitude and climatic regimes. In this study, we investigated the impact of WLF in a large subtropical reservoir in south-eastern China (Hongfeng Reservoir, Guizhou Province). The study was based on monthly samplings carried out in 2014 in six stations. The strong increase in the water level observed in early summer caused a radical shift in the phytoplankton community. While in the pre-flooding period phytoplankton was composed of large diatoms, chrysophytes and Oscillatoriales (mostly Limnothrix sp.), the post-flooding period showed an increase in smaller and more competitive chlorophytes, smaller diatoms and cryptophytes better adapted to a fast colonisation of new and nutrient-rich environments. The environmental drivers that drove the change were dilution, flushing and interference with the seasonal water stratification processes. We concluded that, because WLF represents a complex variable integrating different physical effects in one explanatory descriptor, its value as a predictor of phytoplankton and cyanobacteria dynamics in lake ecosystems is difficult to generalise and needs to be investigated on a case-by-case basis. For this reason, considering the year-to-year hydrological variability that potentially characterise reservoirs, definite indications for management should be outlined considering more than 1-year study.

The structural features of the FAs were characterised using chemical and spectroscopic methods, including elemental analysis, UV-Vis spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and threedimensional excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The O/C, (O + N)/C and C/N ratios of FA extracted from Liangzi Lake (FAL) were higher than those of FA extracted from East Lake (FA(E)), indicating higher oxygen-containing functionality and polarity and less nutrient in FAL compared with FAE. The two FAs had similar UV-Vis spectra with different absorbance intensities. The FT-IR spectra showed that the two FAs had similar functional groups. The total fluorescence intensity and aromaticity of samples from Liangzi Lake were higher than those of East Lake except for those taken in the summer. The two FAs were largely terrestrially derived organic materials. Five fluorescent components, including four humic-like and two fulvic-like components, were identified by PARAFAC modelling of the EEM spectral data. The fluorescence was dominated by two components. The findings suggest that EEM fluorescence spectroscopy together with PARAFAC is a rapid and costeffective method for understanding the characteristics and origins of FAs in natural water systems.					tao, tao/LCD-4163-2024														1448-2517	1449-8979					2015	12	2					189	197		10.1071/EN14135	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EN14135													WOS:000351999300011
J	Garvey, JE; Rettig, JE; Stein, RA; Lodge, DM; Klosiewski, SP				Garvey, JE; Rettig, JE; Stein, RA; Lodge, DM; Klosiewski, SP			Scale-dependent associations among fish predation, littoral habitat, and distributions of crayfish species	ECOLOGY												To predict how species establish and disperse within novel communities, the spatial scale at which competition, predation, and habitat interact must be understood. We explored how these factors affect the distribution and abundance of the exotic crayfishes Orconectes rusticus and O. propinquus and the native O. virilis at both the site-specific and whole-lake scales in northern Wisconsin lakes. During summer 1990, we quantified crayfish, fish predators, and fish diets in cobble and macrophyte sites in Trout Lake, comparing resulting patterns to those in 21 lakes surveyed during summer 1987. Within and across lakes, fish abundance was unrelated to habitat. Within Trout Lake, O. rusticus and O. propinquus were common in both cobble and macrophyte. Orconectes virilis was restricted to macrophyte, probably due to strong displacement by the invaders in cobble. Across lakes, O. rusticus increased where habitat was more than 16.7% cobble, O. propinquus was generally rare, and O. virilis abundance was unrelated to cobble. Crayfish were generally small in cobble and large in macrophyte, perhaps because of habitat-specific, size-selective fish predation or because large crayfish leave cobble when it no longer provides refuge. Orconectes virilis, the largest of three congeners, may have a size refuge in macrophyte but not in. cobble. Across lakes, O. rusticus was only abundant when fish biomass was low; O. virilis abundance varied positively with fish. Effects of fish predation and habitat on the ability of invaders Orconectes rusticus and O. propinquus to establish and replace O. virilis appear to be scale dependent. At local (site-specific) scales, cobble likely interacts with selective predation for O. virilis to allow the invaders to establish and replace the native. At the lake-wide scale, high cobble facilitates invaders but predation may curb their successful dispersal and establishment at new sites. Models of community assembly and invasions need to incorporate scale dependencies in habitat availability and biotic interactions to effectively assess the invasion potential of novel species.

J	Gallina, N; Beniston, M; Jacquet, S				Gallina, Nicole; Beniston, Martin; Jacquet, Stephan			Estimating future cyanobacterial occurrence and importance in lakes: a case study with Planktothrix rubescens in Lake Geneva	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Among the multiple forms of freshwater pelagic cyanobacteria, the phycoerythrin-rich species Planktothrix rubescens is well adapted to temperate, deep and large lakes. In Lake Geneva, this filamentous and microcystin-producing species has been the dominant cyanobacterial species observed since the early years of this century. In addition to the trophic state (e.g., the phosphorus level), the influences of air and water temperature on the occurrence and development of cyanobacteria are particularly relevant in the context of global climate change. The latter may indeed be particularly marked for lakes in the Alpine region, with a rate of warming that may be twice as large as the global average. The impact of climate change on P. rubescens is thus an important challenge and it has been analysed in this study through two different approaches: (1) the extreme air temperature events as a proxy for future climate and (2) the multi adaptive regression splines (MARS) model to predict future P. rubescens biomass. These methods allowed us to determine whether Lake Geneva will still sustain an important biomass of P. rubescens in forthcoming years, provided there is no severe over-enrichment with nutrients in the future. The outcomes strongly suggest that the fraction of cyanobacterium could increase with respect to the total phytoplankton community by as much as 34 % by the end of this century and induce a significant change in the microalgal composition. Additionally, the results point to the fact that spring is a key period during which air temperature and nutrients become the determinant factors for outbreaks of this species in the subsequent seasons.

A MESOCOSM EXPERIMENT IN SUMMER DURING DOMINANCE OF HETEROTROPHIC PROCESSES	HYDROBIOLOGIA					SYMP ON DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER IN LACUSTRINE ECOSYSTEMS : ENERGY SOURCE AND SYSTEM REGULATOR	MAY, 1990	UNIV HELSINKI, LAMMI BIOL STN, HELSINKI, FINLAND		UNIV HELSINKI, LAMMI BIOL STN			The development and metabolism of epilimnetic plankton from a highly humic lake was followed in late summer, when the predominant zooplankton species, Daphnia longispina, was very abundant (ca. 200 ind.l-1). The experiment was made in two tanks: one with an unaltered plankton assemblage and one with larger zooplankton removed. The scarce phytoplankton community was also simple, consisting mainly of one Cryptomonas and two Mallomonas species. The abundance and species composition of smaller plankton was heavily influenced by grazing of Daphnia. In particular, the biomass of heterotrophic flagellates increased after the removal of Daphnia. The biomass and production of bacterioplankton were not affected, and remained several times higher than that of phytoplankton. Bacterial production and grazing on bacteria were balanced, and when Daphnia was removed its grazing activity was compensated by flagellates. The removal of Daphnia did not affect the respiration or community net production of plankton. Among organisms smaller than zooplankton, bacteria seemed to be responsible for most of the respiration. The community net production was consistently negative even at the water surface, indicating an allochthonous carbon source. The results suggest that phytoplankton primary production was insufficient for the secondary production in the epilimnetic water of the study lake. The food requirements of bacteria and zooplankton, as well as of flagellates, each exceeded that supplied by phytoplankton primary production. The simple food chains in this experiment made it possible to reveal the functioning of the community so completely that dissolved organic matter is certainly comparable to or exceeds the importance of phytoplankton primary production as an energy and carbon source for food webs in this humic lake.

This species, originally characterized as a widespread Siberian boreal species, seems to possess high plasticity with regards to environmental requirements. Its actual distribution range covers several geographical zones where local conditions have allowed it to survive. The present research in the Wigry National Park, northeast Poland, shows that its distribution extends to the ends of the East European Plain embracing the East Suwalki Lake District, where it occurs almost exclusively in the oak-hornbeam forests: in summer it is one of the three dominant lithobiomorph centipedes inhabiting litter layers.

The hatching of resting eggs is the main mechanism for restoring active population components. Here, we analyzed the hatching dynamics of zooplankton from sediments of a shallow lake as affected by temperature. Sediment samples collected every other month were incubated at in situ temperatures and at 20 degrees C. The highest number of individual's hatchings was observed for copepod nauplii, the cladoceran Bosmina sp., and the rotifer Brachionus havanaensis. Temperature showed a positive significant effect on the hatchlings of B. havanaensis. Other zooplankton species were less affected by temperature, and there was no relationship between their emergence from the incubated sediments and occurrence in the water column. We also tested the effect of short-term (6 and 12 weeks) and long-term (a year) storage duration on hatching success. The hatching success of B. havanaensis was not affected by the storage time. In contrast, the hatchlings of Bosmina sp. and nauplii increased after short storage time. The evidence collected here suggests that many zooplankters were not affected by temperature, while for B. havanaensis temperature turned out to be a master variable that links planktonic and passive phases.

The positive correlation between CPUE of ayu in set nets in February and April was significant except for 2006, when heavy mortality occurred during February to April. In 2006, the water temperature was the lowest in the 10 years, and plankton biomass was at a relatively low level from January to April. The condition of ayu in mid-February 2006 was relatively poor. The heavy mortality during the 2006 winter may have resulted from low-temperature stress and deterioration of nutritional status.																			0021-5392	1349-998X				JUL	2015	81	4					667	673		10.2331/suisan.81.667	http://dx.doi.org/10.2331/suisan.81.667													WOS:000362056100012

A lack of records showing former permafrost distribution along the northern Alpine fringe prompted the investigation and numerical dating of a belt of relict rock glaciers in the Karwendel Mountains of the Northern Calcareous Austrian Alps. In two neighbouring cirques that were still glaciated during the early Younger Dryas, eleven Cl-36 exposure ages from boulder surfaces were obtained. The ages imply the onset of rock glacier activity around similar to 12.31 a with subsequent stabilization and permafrost melt out no later than similar to 10.1 ka. Hence, rock glacier formation coincided with glacier retreat in the cirques around the mid-Younger Dryas and continued into the early Holocene. As permafrost induced features, the rock glacier termini indicate the local past lower limit of discontinuous permafrost in open cirque floors at similar to 2000 m asl, which is around 400 m lower than during the mid twentieth century at comparable locations in the Karwendel Mountains. Thus, a mean annual air temperature reduction of similar to-2.6 to 3.8 degrees C relative to the mid-twentieth century is inferred. Based on a minimum glacier equilibrium line altitude in the cirques, a summer temperature reduction of less than -2.6 to -1.8 degrees C is shown, suggesting an increased seasonality at the time of rock glacier activity.

Shoot biomass responded to changes in sediment composition regardless of water depth. However, irradiance responses occurred only in the 100% marsh sediments. While sediment composition, irradiance and their interaction explained 91% of the total experimental variation, approximately 75% of the shoot biomass variation was attributable for only 8%.

The epithermal mineralization and thermal springs typically occur along high-angle faults within the broad San Andreas transform fault system that forms the western boundary of the North American plate in this area. The young volcanic rocks overlie Mesozoic marine rocks of the Great Valley sequence which have been thrust above the coeval Franciscan Complex and penecontemporaneously dropped back down along low-angle detachment faults. Many of the waters of the region are nonmeteoric as defined by their isotopic signature. One type of isotopically shifted water emerges from or near Great Valley sequence rocks and is the most chloride rich. It is interpreted to be evolved connate in origin. A second type, evolved meteoric water, has moderate chloride contents, high boron contents, and high B/Cl ratios and is found locally in Franciscan rocks, notably at the Sulphur Bank mercury mine, where it probably results from near-closed-system, repeated boiling of meteoric water in host rocks that also contribute organic components to the water. At the Sulphur Bank mine fracturing of otherwise impermeable Franciscan rocks by faulting has created a localized zone of permeability in which thermal water boils repeatedly with limited venting to the surface. Boron-rich fluids were apparently present at depth in The Geysers geothermal field when intrusion of silicic magma occurred, because the concealed intrusion of felsite is surrounded by a halo of tourmaline-bearing hornfels. The volume of this poorly dated early to middle Quaternary intrusive body probably exceeds the 100 km3 of erupted Clear Lake Volcanics. Similar intrusions may have occurred in the eastern part of the area at Wilbur Springs and the McLaughlin mine, where gold deposition and evidence of hydrothermal phenomena suggest more magmatic activity than is indicated by the small exposed bodies of early Quaternary basaltic lava. The Clear Lake Volcanics are the present locus of volcanism in the northern Coast Ranges and progressively older volcanic centers occur to the south. Geophysical data suggest that a large silicic magma body may be centered north of The Geysers steam field, providing the heat for the geothermal field. Geothermal power production has peaked at The Geysers and pressure declines indicate significant depletion of the fluid resource. The vapor-dominated field evolved from a preexisting hydrothermal system within fractured, otherwise impermeable Franciscan metamorphic rocks. A deep water table of saline fluid has been postulated to be present under the steam field, but no chloride-rich water has been found at drillable depth. We propose that recently discovered, isotopically shifted steam in the northwest Geysers area indicates the presence not of deep connate water but rather of boiled-down, boron-rich Franciscan evolved meteoric water. This water is likely to be present in limited quantities and will not provide a significant hot water resource for geothermal power production at The Geysers field or from the main Clear Lake volcanic field.

A nuclear marker was used for the first time to study relationships between and among Knipowitschia species. The results show that the population from Albania belongs to Knipowitschia goerneri Ahnelt, 1991 (Corfu dwarf goby), a species previously thought to be endemic to the Korission Lagoon catchment on Kerkyra Island, Greece. Based on both mitochondrial and nuclear markers, this species was recovered in a well-supported Ionian clade also comprising Knipowitschia milleri (Ahnelt & Bianco, 1990) (Acheron spring goby) from the Acheron River and the Knipowitschia population from Trichonis Lake.

J	Colgan, S; Sun, X; Holmes, HA				Colgan, Sean; Sun, Xia; Holmes, Heather A.			A novel meteorological method to classify wintertime cold-air pool events	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Cold-air pools (CAPs) are common in mountain valleys throughout the world (e.g., western North America, Himalayas, Alps, etc.) during winter months. Weak surface winds, cold temperatures, high humidity, and snow cover presence are common characteristics of CAPs, and in populated areas there is an increase in air pollution concentrations. Previous methods for identifying CAP events and determining their strength often rely on a combination of, radiosonde data, air pollution concentrations, and/or surface meteorological datasets. Ambient air pollution concentrations vary by location based on the local emissions sources and continually change due to regulations and human activity patterns, therefore they are unreliable for consistent CAP quantification. Here, the bulk atmospheric stability is calculated as the valley heat deficit (VHD) using radiosonde data for 12 locations in the western U.S. over 16 winters. A new CAP classification method is developed and compared to three existing CAP classification methods. Results indicate that the new method agrees well with existing approaches but provides a more robust CAP classification because it is solely based on meteorology and not air quality. For all locations, 00Z (afternoon/early evening) radiosondes account for roughly 8-41% of all CAP occurrences (12Z and 00Z), independent of the method used. Meaning that the stable boundary layer persists throughout the daytime in these cases often leading to persistent CAP events (PCAP). While PCAP length varies across locations, they are a similar order of magnitude because synoptic conditions that span the entire western U.S. govern CAP onset and PCAP length. Additionally, several locations (e.g., Reno, Elko, Spokane, Riverton, and Grand Junction) release radiosondes from a site located at an elevation above the valley floor, often underestimating the bulk atmospheric stability by more than 30%. A method to incorporate surface station data in the bulk atmospheric stability calculation is given to reduce this underestimation.

However, we have only incomplete knowledge about the seasonal and inter-annual variations observed among these microbes and about their methane regulation mechanisms with respect to glaciers, glacial melting, snow lakes and coastal marine water. This gap in our knowledge limits our understanding of the linkages between climate and environmental change. In the Arctic, there are large reservoirs of methane which are sensitive to temperature changes. If global warming intensifies, larger quantities of methane stored in deep soil and sediments will be released into the atmosphere, causing irreversible effects on the global ecosystem. Methane production is mainly mediated by microorganisms. Although we have some knowledge of microbial community structure, we know less about the methane-correlated microbes in different land types in the Svalbard archipelago, and we do not have a comprehensive grasp of the relationship between them. That is the main reason we have written this paper, in which current knowledge of microorganisms and methane-correlated types in High Arctic Svalbard is described. The problems that need to be addressed in the future are also identified.

Seasonal and Spatial Variability of Dissolved Carbon Concentration and Composition in Lake Michigan Tributaries	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a complex mixture of many compounds and its composition dictates numerous reactions in the environment. Large lakes and marine coastlines receive DOM from watersheds that differ widely in their land cover, with potential implications for both the quantity and composition of carbon inputs. Seasonal variation in DOM quantity and composition may also differ among tributaries and be mediated by land cover. Here, we quantify spatially (i.e., among tributary) and seasonal variation in DOM concentration, DOM composition based on ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, and alkalinity across 101 tributaries of Lake Michigan, one of the world's largest lakes, using a synoptic sampling approach. Wetland land cover has the largest effect on DOM, producing high concentrations of DOM that are more aromatic and larger in apparent molecular weight. Seasonal variation is also pronounced, with concentrations and aromaticity of DOM peaking in fall across most tributaries. Watershed lithology and land cover both affect alkalinity, with higher values associated with the geography of carbonate bedrock and urbanized watersheds. Watershed land cover has a larger effect than season on all organic carbon parameters. However, seasonal variation is especially important for DOM composition. This disparity suggests that the environmental processing of DOM within river channels mediates its composition more than its concentrations. Considering the wide range of land cover and lithology around Lake Michigan and other large water bodies, accounting for both spatial and seasonal dynamics is essential for understanding controls on DOM delivery.

Perennially ice-covered meromictic lakes are particularly stable, with long term constancy in their density profiles. Here we sampled Lake A, a deep meromictic lake at latitude 83 degrees N in High Arctic Canada. Sampling was before (May) and after (August) an unusual ice-out event during the warm 2008 summer. We determined the bacterial and archaeal community composition by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene tag-pyrosequencing. Both prokaryote communities were stratified by depth and the Bacteria differed between dates, indicating locally driven selection processes. We matched taxa to known taxon-specific biogeochemical functions and found a close correspondence between the depth of functional specialists and chemical gradients. These results indicate a rich microbial diversity despite the extreme location, with pronounced vertical structure in taxonomic and potential functional composition, and with community shifts during ice-out.

J	Nie, YB; Sun, JQ				Nie, Yanbo; Sun, Jianqi			Synoptic-Scale Circulation Precursors of Extreme Precipitation Events Over Southwest China During the Rainy Season	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												This study analyzes the synoptic-scale circulation patterns favorable for regional extreme precipitation events over southwest China (SWC) from 1979 to 2018 occurring during the rainy seasons. The whole SWC is regionalized into two subregions, western SWC and eastern SWC, according to the spatial distribution of two extreme precipitation indices. Furthermore, the atmospheric patterns associated with the independent regional extreme precipitation events (REPEs) that occurred over the two subregions are categorized into two types using k-means clustering. For type 1, a Rossby wave train originating from the Northeast Atlantic almost a week before REPEs leads to an anomalous low over the eastern Tibetan Plateau (TP), inducing upper-troposphere divergence and ascending motion over SWC. Moreover, anomalous convective activities over India and the Bay of Bengal (the enhanced and westward-extended western Pacific subtropical high) are critical precursors of REPEs over western (eastern) SWC. For type 2, an anomalous high is developed over the Ural Mountains at least a week prior to REPEs. The subsequent anomalous low over Lake Baikal and eastward-shifted South Asian high are conducive to forming updrafts over SWC. An anomalous anticyclone at the middle-to-lower troposphere south of the TP is the main moisture contributor. Discrepancies in the zonal location of the Lake Baikal low and the strength of the Ural Mountain high, as well as the intensity of atmospheric circulation anomalies at low latitudes, are the major differences between the type 2 events occurring in western and eastern SWC. Key Points Two types of atmospheric circulation anomalies are favorable for extreme precipitation events over southwest China during rainy seasons Rossby wave trains from the Northeast Atlantic and the Ural Mountains are critical precursors of the extreme precipitation events The low-latitude atmospheric circulation anomalies mainly determine the spatial differences and the extremeness of the events					Nie, Yanbo/GZG-5756-2022	Nie, Yanbo/0000-0001-5166-7751													2169-897X	2169-8996				JUL 8	2021	126	13							e2021JD035134	10.1029/2021JD035134	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JD035134													WOS:000704189400022
J	Peng, CY; Zhang, XL; Meng, Z				Peng, Chengyan; Zhang, Xueliang; Meng, Zhou			Bearing estimation for optical fiber vector hydrophone with in-band resonance	APPLIED ACOUSTICS												The accelerometer-type optical fiber vector hydrophone (OFVH) shows resonance in its frequency response due to the mass-spring structure of the accelerometer. To avoid signal distortion, the usable frequency band of an OFVH is usually limited to far below the resonant frequency. Increasing the resonant frequency would extend the frequency band but at the expense of decreased hydrophone sensitivity. This paper points out that for bearing estimation, the out-of-band frequency components of the OFVH output are usable, which leads to efficient utilization of the OFVH signal and enhancement of target detection performance in some circumstances. A modification of the intensity-based algorithm, along with calibrations based on the simple oscillator model, are given for the bearing estimation in this paper. The analysis are confirmed by results of lake experiments using an acoustic source, a fixed pump and a small ship. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

General Steady-State Shape Factor for a Partially Penetrating Well	GROUND WATER												We present the closed form of a general steady-state shape factor for a partially penetrating well in a uniform anisotropic aquifer. Our simple analytical expression for the shape factor has a uniform representation for full range of parameters and meets or exceeds the accuracy of previous results obtained through semiempirical methods (e.g., Bouwer and Rice [1976] equations). This general shape factor pertains to the flow of fluids (water or air) in subsurface formations when the upper formation boundary has constant potential and the lower boundary is impermeable. The results of our investigation are directly applicable to analyses of (1) slug tests with falling or rising head and (2) injection/extraction tests with constant head, essential techniques for the characterization of hydraulic conductivity of aquifers, streambeds, or lakebeds as well as the design of aquifer and soil remediation systems.																			0017-467X					JAN-FEB	2010	48	1					111	116		10.1111/j.1745-6584.2009.00621.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2009.00621.x								19732160					WOS:000273065200019

A combination of microscopy and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pigment analysis was used. All over the lake, the dominant functional group (by biovolume) was the vernal diatom blooms, due to the dominance of endemic Cyclotella species. Chlorophyll a (Chl a) was significantly highest at the Selenga and Barguzin inflows (2.39 +/- 0.34 and 2.49 +/- 0.18 nmol L-1, mean +/- 95% CI, respectively) and higher in the South than in the North (1.43 +/- 0.26 and 0.96 +/- 0.13 nmol L-1). This variation of Chl a reflected changes in the phytoplankton composition. Diatoms and Chrysophyceae were the major contributors to the total Chl a except in the South (Chlorophyceae) and Selenga Delta (cyanobacterial picoplankton). There were also indications of species composition changes due to enhanced P-loading from the Selenga River. However, canonical analyses indicated that temperature and stratification were the major driving forces for regional distribution patterns and seasonal succession. It seems likely that further global warming will cause a shift in the species and group composition towards small cells at the expense of the large endemic diatom flora.

The first appearance of this Prosobranch snail was recorded along the western shore of the Tihany peninsula situated on the middle section of the lake, at 21st of October 2013 during a routine macrozoobenthos sampling. Occurrence of the species was also recorded along the eastern shoreline of the peninsula in 2015, and it became highly abundant in both areas in the following years. Results of a comprehensive survey conducted in the autumn of 2018 in the littoral region of the lake revealed that the river nerite has colonized almost the entire shoreline of Lake Balaton, only the westernmost and easternmost areas were still devoid of this invader, therefore it seems that its spread has not been finished yet. The river nerite appeared in extremely high abundances (up to 4-5000 individuals/m(2)) in the middle area of the lake, therefore it is likely that this species will have a significant effect on the biota of Lake Balaton, especially in the littoral zone of the lake.

J	Sammons, SM; Maceina, MJ; Partridge, DG				Sammons, SM; Maceina, MJ; Partridge, DG			Changes in behavior, movement, and home ranges of largemouth bass following large-scale hydrilla removal in Lake Seminole, Georgia	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												About 1,200 ha of hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata L.f. Royle) was eliminated in the Spring Creek embayment of Lake Seminole, Georgia, using a drip-delivery application of fluridone (1-methyl-3-phenyl-5-[3-(trifluoromethl) phenyl]-4(1H)-pyridinone) in 2000 and 2001. Two groups of 15 and 20 large-mouth bass (Micropterus salmoides Lacepede) were implanted with 400-day radio tags in February 2000 and 2001 to determine changes in movement and behavior before and after hydrilla reduction. Fish were located approximately every 10 days beginning two weeks after tag insertion; beginning in May 2000 diel movement was assessed once a month, and on each sampling date the fish were located every 4 hours for 24 hours (six locations per sampling date). Only fish that were at large in the lake for at least 200 days and with at least 35 locations were used for analysis; 19 fish met these criteria. Locations were grouped into two treatment levels based on the amount of hydrilla present in the system, a pre-treatment period (May to August 2000) when hydrilla coverage in Spring Creek was 72%, and a post treatment period (June to October 2001) when coverage was 22%. Most largemouth bass remained in the treatment area and maintained similar home range sizes during both treatment periods. However, fish exhibited greater movement, inhabited greater depths, and switched from using hydrilla to large woody debris after hydrilla was reduced. Fish may have responded to better foraging conditions by changing feeding strategies from ambushing to searching, which should increase foraging success. Decreased water clarity and increased threadfin shad abundance may have precipitated the increased daytime movement we observed in this study. Our data demonstrated that while largemouth bass do not leave an area when hydrilla is reduced with fluridone, their behavior does change. Lake managers involved in aquatic plant removal programs can exchange this information with anglers concerning the effects of hydrilla treatment and potential impacts to the fishery.					; Sammons, Steve/KHW-1491-2024	Sammons, Steve/0000-0002-7814-6400; 													0146-6623					JAN	2003	41						31	38																WOS:000182878700007

We present the case of the lake Volkerak-Zoommeer in the Netherlands, a freshwater lake created in 1987 after the enclosure of an estuary. Using an experimental area in which the water level could be manipulated, it was shown that partial summer drawdown of the shoreline created suitable conditions for germination and growth of tall emergent species (in particular Phragmites australis). Plant survival and growth depended on subsequent water-level fluctuations and grazing by waterbirds. Based on the experiment and empirical data, a model was developed to predict the effects of the water-level regime on potential reed bed development. The model was applied for four hydrological scenarios that have been considered for the water-level management of the lake.					van Nes, Egbert/F-2681-2011	van Nes, Egbert/0000-0002-6345-104X													0075-9511					MAY	2004	34	1-2					57	64		10.1016/S0075-9511(04)80022-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0075-9511(04)80022-7													WOS:000222030800008

Nearshore-offshore comparison of chlorophyll a and phytoplankton production in the dreissenid-colonized eastern basin of Lake Erie	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Planktonic primary production, chlorophyll a (chl a), underwater light climate, and total phosphorus were measured at 18 stations during 2001 and 2002 in eastern Lake Erie to characterize spatial and seasonal patterns in this system colonized by dreissenid mussels (Dreissena spp.). Areal production rates and chl a displayed a seasonal pattern typical of the Laurentian Great Lakes, with highest production in the early and late summer. Daily and seasonal (May-October) primary production was significantly lower nearshore than offshore. Although light attenuation was similar between nearshore and offshore, the nearshore light climate was generally more favorable for phytoplankton because of shallower mixing depths. However, chl a was significantly lower nearshore, which accounted for most of the depression in production rates. Nearshore chl a was lower than predicted from relationships with total phosphorus in comparable dreissenid-free systems. Offshore, subepilimnetic communities contributed up to 67% of daily production but only up to 19% of seasonal production. The depression of chl a and primary production in the nearshore was a reversal from historic patterns in eastern Lake Erie and from the pattern traditionally expected in large lakes. Decreased external nutrient loading and dreissenid colonization may both have contributed to this new spatial pattern, but dreissenids appear to be key agents.

Lands adjacent to Steamboat Creek receive, on average, seven inches of precipitation annually. Land uses in the Steamboat Creek basin are agricultural, urban, and undeveloped. Steamboat Creek is a complex system due to the presence of numerous irrigation diversions and the Steamboat Springs geothermal area. The Steamboat Creek basin is experiencing urbanization of agricultural and undeveloped lands. Historic water quality data was analyzed to identify trends associated with different land uses adjacent to the creek, seasonal flows, and irrigation regimes. Three Lagrangian-style water quality surveys were performed-one each during high flow with irrigation, medium flow with irrigation, and low flow with minimal irrigation. Each water quality survey occurred during dry conditions and followed dry antecedent conditions. Hydrodynamics, nutrient flux, and diel variation of dissolved oxygen concentrations associated with periphyton productivity will be simulated using the Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program Version 5 (WASP5).																					1-882132-47-5				1999							369	375																WOS:000084434300046

Bad Year Economics at Birchy Lake	JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Anthropologists have long been interested in understanding how societies cope with risk and uncertainty in their subsistence economies. The topic has been of particular interest to the study of hunters and gatherers, where risk and uncertainty are often conceptualized as problems of the natural rather than social environment. This paper focuses on an archaeological site located in the interior of the island of Newfoundland that was inhabited by Amerindian people hunting caribou in the spring of the year, presumably because they were having difficulty procuring marine resources at the coast. The plight of these Amerindians, at a time when they were sharing the island with Paleo-Inuit peoples and climate change was undermining islanders' access to critical marine resources, highlights the complex play between cultural adaptation, social and historical processes, and the natural environment.

It plays a vital role in the stability of ecosystem structure and function in shallow lakes and reser-voirs. With Baiyangdian Lake as the research area, Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI and Sentinel-2 imagery datasets were used to explore the phenological characteristics of SAV over different time scales and construct a phenological map of the SAV groups. The long-term spatial distribution characteristics and trends of SAV from 1986 to 2021 were analyzed. The results show the following: (1) the harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS) eliminated abnormal observations and noise. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series curves generated after HANTS accurately reflected the phenological characteristics of SAV. The early spring submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV1), such as Potamogeton crispus, entered the germination period in late February at the earliest (DOY = 53). The mature period ran from April to May, after which SAV1 began to decline gradually. The length of the growing season (LOS) was about 110 days. SAV2, which was represented by Ceratophyllum demersum, Myriophyllum verticillatum, and Potamogeton pectinatus, germinated in early April (DOY = 99). The mature period ran from July to September. The length of the growing season was 210 days. (2) The decision tree constructed based on the NDVI and modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) identified SAV with an accuracy of 89.7%. (3) The distribution range of the SAV changed dramatically during 1986-2021. According to the area change, it can be divided into a shrinkage period, expansion period, degeneration period, and initial period of recovery. The succession trend of SAV provide a theoretical scientific basis and technical support for the ecological restoration and management of shallow lake ecosystems.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2023	154								110646	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110646	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110646		JUL 2023											WOS:001040414800001

Effects of capture depth on walleye hooking mortality during ice fishing	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Lyon CA, Davis JL, Fincel MJ, Chipps SR. 2022. Effects of capture depth on walleye hooking mortality during ice fishing. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXX-XXX. Length-based regulations are a common tool used to limit fishing mortality by controlling the size of fish harvested. While such regulations are helpful in managing fish populations, mortality associated with catch-and-release fishing may negatively impact a fishery. We evaluated factors affecting hooking mortality of walleye (Sander vitreus) in 2 mainstem Missouri River reservoirs in South Dakota. Winter walleye hooking mortality was evaluated during the ice fishing season in February and March 2020. After capture, walleye (n = 55) were placed into holding pens for 12 to 72 h to monitor postrelease mortality. Hooking mortality was found to be 20% following angling. Capture depth, landing time, and time in pen were the most influential variables on probability of hooking mortality (p(m)). We observed a sharp increase in p(m) for walleye captured at depths from 10 to 12 m, where the probability of mortality for fish increased appreciably from 5 to 37%, respectively. Our findings indicate that hooking mortality during the ice fishing season can be substantial in lakes where walleye angling occurs at depths greater than 10 m.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				OCT 2	2022	38	4					334	340		10.1080/10402381.2022.2130118	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2022.2130118		OCT 2022											WOS:000884136000001

This restoration technique is based on the forced discharge of nutrient-rich bottom waters in lakes with anoxic hypolimnia, while surface outflows are dammed. Internal phosphorus load amounted to 600 mg m-2 summer-1 before withdrawal. Most of this load probably originated from the sediment since the experimentally determined sediment phosphorus release rates of 2-12 mg m-2 day-1 can account for the internal load. The smaller lake responded to hypolimnetic withdrawal with decreasing epilimnetic and hypolimnetic phosphorus concentrations, decreased anoxia and internal loads. The larger lake also showed a tendency towards improvement which is, however, not statistically significant.

Modes of Pangean lake level cyclicity driven by astronomical climate pacing modulated by continental position and pCO2	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Orbital cyclicity is a fundamental pacemaker of Earth's climate system. The Newark-Hartford Basin (NHB) lake sediment record of eastern North America contains compelling geologic expressions of this cyclicity, reflecting variations of climatic conditions in tropical Pangea during the Late Triassic and earliest Jurassic (similar to 233 to 199 Ma). Climate modeling enables a deeper mechanistic understanding of Earth system modulation during this unique greenhouse and supercontinent period. We linkmajor features of the NHB record to the combined climatic effects of orbital forcing, paleogeographic changes, and atmospheric pCO(2) variations. An ensemble of transient, orbitally driven climate simulations is assessed for nine time slices, three atmospheric pCO(2) values, and two paleogeographic reconstructions. Climatic transitions from tropical humid to more seasonal and ultimately semiarid are associated with tectonic drift of the NHB from similar to 5.N to 20.N. The modeled orbital modulation of the precipitation-evaporation balance is most pronounced during the 220 to 200Ma interval, whereas it is limited by weak seasonality and increasing aridity before and after this interval. Lower pCO(2) at around 205Ma contributes to drier climates and could have led to the observed damping of sediment cyclicity. Eccentricity-modulated precession dominates the orbitally driven climate response in the NHB region. High obliquity further amplifies summer precipitation through the seasonal shifts in the tropical rainfall belt. Regions with other proxy records are also assessed, providing guidance toward an integrated picture of global astronomical climate forcing in the Late Triassic and ultimately of other periods in Earth history.					; Willeit, Matteo/GWQ-9457-2022; Sames, Benjamin/GLV-0360-2022; Wagreich, Michael/D-2279-2013; Feulner, Georg/A-1933-2011	Wagreich, Michael/0000-0002-8828-0857; Petri, Stefan/0000-0002-4379-4643; Whiteside, Jessica/0000-0001-9403-4516; Feulner, Georg/0000-0001-9215-5517; Landwehrs, Jan/0000-0002-6142-2237													0027-8424	1091-6490				NOV 15	2022	119	46							e2203818119	10.1073/pnas.2203818119	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2203818119								36343239					WOS:000995345200009

Restoring the greater Florida Everglades, once and for all	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The dilemma and ultimate solutions to recent ecological and economic disasters of polluted farm runoff being discharged in the Florida estuaries, described by some as much more severe than anything that happened to Florida's coastline during the 2010 BP oil spill on the Gulf of Mexico, is presented. Two particularly notable episodes have occurred in the last few years. In 2013, 746 million m(3)/yr of water from Lake Okeechobee was discharged to the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean estuaries, much of it in the summer wet season, with significant ecological disruption on both coasts. In February 2016, an unusually high amount of precipitation in the dry season (>30 cm in January 2015) led to 326 million m(3) of polluted Lake Okeechobee water being discharged to the sea over a 2-week period in early February. The obvious solution to this estuarine pollution is to allow water from the lake to flow to south as it historically did before water management was imposed on the lake and watershed. But that would cause polluted water to flow to the oligotrophic and much treasured Florida Everglades. We estimate that the water quality issue could be solved by creating an additional 40,000 Ha of stormwater treatment wetlands. Those would complement the 23,000 Ha of stormwater treatment wetlands that have already been created. Creating a deepwater reservoir to store the excess water is not a sustainable option.

J	Cook, TL; Bradley, RS; Stoner, JS; Francus, P				Cook, Timothy L.; Bradley, Raymond S.; Stoner, Joseph S.; Francus, Pierre			Five thousand years of sediment transfer in a high arctic watershed recorded in annually laminated sediments from Lower Murray Lake, Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Sediments in Lower Murray Lake, northern Ellesmere Island, Nunavut Canada (81A degrees 21'A N, 69A degrees 32'A W) contain annual laminations (varves) that provide a record of sediment accumulation through the past 5000+ years. Annual mass accumulation was estimated based on measurements of varve thickness and sediment bulk density. Comparison of Lower Murray Lake mass accumulation with instrumental climate data, long-term records of climatic forcing mechanisms and other regional paleoclimate records suggests that lake sedimentation is positively correlated with regional melt season temperatures driven by radiative forcing. The temperature reconstruction suggests that recent temperatures are similar to 2.6A degrees C higher than minimum temperatures observed during the Little Ice Age, maximum temperatures during the past 5200 years exceeded modern values by similar to 0.6A degrees C, and that minimum temperatures observed approximately 2900 varve years BC were similar to 3.5A degrees C colder than recent conditions. Recent temperatures were the warmest since the fourteenth century, but similar conditions existed intermittently during the period spanning similar to 4000-1000 varve years ago. A highly stable pattern of sedimentation throughout the period of record supports the use of annual mass accumulation in Lower Murray Lake as a reliable proxy indicator of local climatic conditions in the past.					; Bradley, Raymond/P-9358-2015	Stoner, Joseph Stephen/0000-0002-4848-5452; Francus, Pierre/0000-0001-5465-1966; Cook, Timothy/0000-0002-4982-6415													0921-2728	1573-0417				JAN	2009	41	1					77	94		10.1007/s10933-008-9252-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-008-9252-0													WOS:000262505400006

However, many of these are threatened by habitat degradation and by the introduction of non-native species. Here, we assess the status of the native threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in the Lake Bracciano region in Italy, where stickleback have been historically present. During a dedicated sampling campaign in summer 2015, surveying the potential habitats that sticklebacks commonly occupy, we could not confirm the presence of this species but found introduced species to be often most abundant. Stickleback are thus likely to either have become extinct over the last decades or be on the verge to extinction in the Lake Bracciano region.

Microplastics in the gastrointestinal tracts of fish and the water from an urban prairie creek	FACETS												Microplastics are defined as any plastic with a diameter <= 5 mm. Problems associated with these plastics such as contamination of both marine and freshwater environments and ingestion by aquatic organisms are of increasing concern. Our study quantifies the number of microplastics in a prairie creek immediately downstream of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. Water samples and five species of fish were collected from sample sites upstream and downstream of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in the summers of 2015 and 2016. Samples were digested in either a Fe(II)/H2O2 or NaClO solution and observed under a microscope where plastics present were enumerated by colour and type. At least one microplastic was detected in 73.5% of fish and 95.6% of water samples, showing that the creek does, in fact, contain microplastics. Concentrations were higher in water from upstream sites, likely due to dilution of creek water by the release of treated effluent. The results of this study provide baseline conditions for the presence of plastics in the creek prior to a major upgrade of the WWTP scheduled for completion in 2016.																			2371-1671					MAY 2	2017	2						395	409		10.1139/facets-2017-0008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/facets-2017-0008													WOS:000409850200001

These studies however are based on single-city analysis and often fail to consider whether these interactions occur more generally. We examine a multi-city comparison using a common set of spatially-explicit water, socioeconomic, and biophysical data. We investigate the relative importance of variables for explaining the variations of single family residential (SFR) water uses at Census Block Group (CBG) and Census Tract (CT) scales in four representative western US cities - Austin, Phoenix, Portland, and Salt Lake City, - which cover a wide range of climate and development density. We used both ordinary least squares regression and spatial error regression models to identify the influence of spatial dependence on water use patterns. Our results show that older downtown areas show lower water use than newer suburban areas in all four cities. Tax assessed value and building age are the main determinants of SFR water use across the four cities regardless of the scale. Impervious surface area becomes an important variable for summer water use in all cities, and it is important in all seasons for arid environments such as Phoenix. CT level analysis shows better model predictability than CBG analysis. In all cities, seasons, and spatial scales, spatial error regression models better explain the variations of SFR water use. Such a spatially-varying relationship of urban water consumption provides additional evidence for the need to integrate urban land use planning and municipal water planning. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Deocampo, DM				Deocampo, DM			Sedimentary structures generated by Hippopotamus amphibius in a lake-margin wetland, Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania	PALAIOS												Large mammals, especially Hippopotamus amphibius, have created a distinctive set of traces in a spring-fed freshwater wetland on the margin of the saline-alkaline Crater lake in the Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania. It is comprised of a similar to30 m diameter zone of deep (<2m) bioturbation due to hippo wallowing, surrounded by dendritic to radial hippo trails 1-5 m wide and <0.5 m deep, infilled with organic-rich mud. These trails narrow and thin as they grade into trackways on the lake flat. Tracks and trackways of more terrestrial mammals, such as bovids and equids, are found in the lake flat muds surrounding the hippo-dominated area. Associations of sedimentary structures such as these are important indicators of paleoenvironmental conditions where they are preserved in the sedimentary record, due to the strong affinity of Hippopotamidae for freshwater environments.

A cross-case comparative analysis was completed by focusing on post-Games legacy organizations from three Winter Olympics (Salt Lake City 2002, Vancouver 2010, and PyeongChang 2018). Drawing on a governance framework, this research investigates the politics (stakeholder relationships), polity (institutional structures), and policy (the policy content and instruments) dimensions of governance, and explores modes of governance that facilitate collective action taken by these organizations. Data for this study included archival materials and semistructured interviews with key representatives from the relevant organizations. Three different post-Games legacy organization governance modes (public-private, interactive, and self-governance) were identified, and a conceptual model of the governance of post-Games legacy organizations is proposed. The findings have theoretical and practical implications that expand our understanding of the governance of Olympic legacy.

Gypsum Deltas at the Holocene Dead Sea Linked to Grand Solar Minima	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Unique gypsum structures: large capes (termed "gypsum deltas") and small pitted gypsum mounds are exposed along the western shores of the currently retreating Dead Sea, the hypersaline terminal lake in the Dead Sea Basin. The gypsum deltas were formed during time intervals of low lake stands (similar to 420 +/- 10 m below mean sea level), when sulfate-rich Ca chloride brines discharged from the coastal aquifer via saline springs, mixed with the Dead Sea brine and precipitated the gypsum (outsalting process). The ages of formation of the gypsum structures coincide with times of North Atlantic cooling events and grand solar minima suggesting a direct impact of the latter on the Dead Sea hydrology and high sensitivity of the regional hydrology (controlling lake level) to global solar-related events. The temporal occurrence and numbers of the gypsum structures appear to follow the Hallstatt Cycle that approaches minima at similar to 3,000-2,000 years before present.					; Yechieli, Yoseph/ABA-5546-2020	Lazar, Boaz/0000-0002-2304-8993; weber, Nurit/0000-0003-3958-1087; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				MAR 28	2021	48	6							e2020GL091034	10.1029/2020GL091034	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020GL091034													WOS:000635209100058

However, plant biomass supplies litter after the onset of senescence. Although litter-derived nitrogen (N) has been considered a nutrient source for the internal loading that may reduce CW performance, little is known about the quantitative N dynamics associated with litter decomposition. Thus, a controversial question remains about whether plant harvest is needed to manage CWs. In this study, we evaluated the decomposition and the fate of N derived from N-15-labeled Phragmites litter in a CW for 1 year. To simulate respective natural conditions, two treatments, including (1) a single winter harvest and (2) no harvest where the latter supplies a greater stem litterfall, were compared. Although the dry weight of the added stem litter was approximately 4.7 times larger in the no harvest plot than in the harvest plot, the total N content of the initial N-15-labeled litter was only 1.2 times higher in the no harvest plot than in the harvest plots because of the low N concentration in the stem litter. The litter functioned as a minor N sink within the first 6 months of decomposition, and it then shifted to functioning as a minor N source after 1 year of decomposition. The recovery of litter-derived N in the sediment and plant biomass was low (less than 10% of the initial litter N), and much of the remaining N might have been released into ambient water or lost through denitrification. Furthermore, our results suggested a potentially low contribution of litter-derived N to internal N loading for at least 1 year regardless of the harvest management treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Laboratory populations of cloned Daphnia pulex at three population phases (growing phase, density peak, declining phase) were exposed to the insecticide carbaryl at 15 mug L-1, which killed juveniles but not adults. 2. The population decline was largest and recovery was slowest when the chemical was applied at the density peak, indicating that the population was most sensitive to the chemical at that stage. Populations in the declining phase were least affected by the treatment. 3. We propose that food condition, which varies with population density, was a major factor affecting vulnerability to carbaryl. In that case, Daphnia populations in lakes would be most vulnerable to toxic chemicals during food-limited condition such as the spring clear-water phase.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				APR	2004	49	4					402	409		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01191.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01191.x													WOS:000220272600004

Lake Burdur is located at 37 degrees 45' N-30 degrees 13' E in a closed river basin. The habitat utilizing the lake is in danger because of decrease in the lake area. Water quality of Lake Burdur is saline-sulfate property and is not qualified for irrigation. Bozcay stream is low in EC, SAR and boron content which makes the stream attractive for irrigation. Flow rate of Bozcay stream is lower in summer season when the irrigation rates are very high. The satellite images revealed that the last two decades, the area shrinking was 65.98%. Between 1987 and 2000 the area decreased 22.68% when the most water derivation constructions were built. Between 2000 and 2010, the area decreased 14.63%.

The additions had to be continued due to ongoing inflows of acid ground and surface water. This paper reports on the changes in the plankton community accompanying the neutralisation. At the beginning, the community composition and biomass was comparable to other acidic pit lakes, i.e. the pigmented flagellates Chlamydomonas and Ochromonas dominated the autotrophs, and ciliates and rotifers were the top predators. The biomass was small (maximum 2 mg fresh weight per litre) and decreased until the end of 2008. With increasing pH, the autotrophic community became more diverse, whereby diatoms, chrysophyceans and blue greens contributed significantly to biomass. Although neutral pH conditions were achieved in autumn 2007, picocyanobacteria were not present until the end of 2008. In addition, crustaceans were under-represented in terms of biomass and diversity. Daphnids were not found. We attributed this to short-term changes of the ionic composition of the water and to the limited time available for non-acido-tolerant organisms to colonise the system. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

Thus, the heterotrophic bacteria acted as a sink and competed for inorganic phosphate with the algae, but the bacteria were unable to achieve physiological P saturation. Heterotrophic flagellates feeding on P-rich bacteria regenerated two-thirds of the P released by grazers. Therefore the role of bacteria is not as mineralizers but as net consumers of phosphate, and, because of their high requirement for P, they are a key factor in regulating the P flux in lakes. The main importance of bacteria in regeneration of P is as P-rich food particles.

The intake of approximately 20 m3/s of cooling water from the bottom of the harbour, as opposed to the current practice of surface withdrawal, was calculated; the result indicates marginally reduced thermal stratification and hypolimnetic volumes in summer. It was shown by a further sensitivity analysis that the reason for this relatively weak response to the withdrawal level was due to the overwhelming input of colder Lake Ontario water to the Harbour.																			0315-1468					APR	1992	19	2					355	358		10.1139/l92-039	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/l92-039													WOS:A1992JC70600014

Bacterial Communities of the Selenga River, Its Tributaries, and the Selenga Shallows in the Summer of 2021	MICROBIOLOGY												The first data on the diversity and structure of bacterial communities in the Selenga River, its tributaries, and delta waters (Selenga shallows) during the summer high-water period of 2021 were obtained. The chemical indices (alkalinity, mineralization, as well as concentrations of sulfate and chloride ions) in the Russian part of the Selenga River exhibited a tendency to decrease gradually in the downstream direction. As before, the chemical composition of the Selenga River waters was determined by water content and anthropogenic pressures, while the effect of tributary waters was local. At a distance of 1 km from the mouths in the mixing zone of river water and lake water, the chemical composition and taxonomic structure of bacterial communities were close to those observed in the pelagic zone of Lake Baikal. In all analyzed 16S rRNA gene libraries, nine common bacterial phyla were identified, with a predominance of Pseudomonadota (51.71-76.83%) in river communities and Actinomycetota (17.28-66.32%) in the communities of the Selenga shallows. The most significant differences in the taxonomic composition of bacterial communities were noted at the genus level. We suggest that a stable bacterial community exists throughout the Selenga River course, with dominant members representing the bacterial genera Limnohabitans, Pseudarcicella, Rhodoluna, and Polynucleobacter. The same genera also predominated in the small rivers of South Baikal. A comparative analysis of the diversity of tributary communities did not reveal any significant impact on the microbiomes of the Selenga River and Lake Baikal. Only a few riverine bacterial taxa were identified in the littoral and pelagic zones of the lake.

We collected and analyzed clinical and demographic data.ResultsEighteen infants with PeV meningitis were admitted within our time frame, with 8 (44%) of the admissions occurring in July. Patients' mean age was 28.7 days and mean length of stay was 50.5 hours. Although all had a history of fever, only 72% were febrile on presentation. Laboratory findings showed a procalcitonin of less than 0.5 ng/mL in 86% of the 14 patients who had it drawn and no cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis in 83% of the patients who had CSF cell counts sent. Neutropenia was present in 17%. Although 89% of infants were given initial antibiotics, antibiotics were discontinued in 63% once their CSF panel returned positive for PeV, and in all by 48 hours.ConclusionsInfants hospitalized with PeV meningitis were febrile and fussy, but experienced uncomplicated hospital stays without neurological deficits. Parechovirus meningitis must be considered as a common cause of acute viral meningitis in young infants even without CSF pleocytosis. This study, although limited in scope and follow-up, can potentially assist in the diagnosis and treatment of PeV meningitis at other institutions.					; Miller, Jonathan/AHA-7710-2022	Miller, Jonathan/0000-0001-5417-5170; Loiselle, Claire/0000-0001-7633-6449; Calardo, Sarah/0009-0000-6323-4697													0749-5161	1535-1815				JAN	2024	40	1					22	26		10.1097/PEC.0000000000002973	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/PEC.0000000000002973								37205850					WOS:001134250800012
J	COONEY, JJ; SILVER, SA; BECK, EA				COONEY, JJ; SILVER, SA; BECK, EA			FACTORS INFLUENCING HYDROCARBON DEGRADATION IN 3 FRESH-WATER LAKES	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The mixed microbial flora of 3 lakes in Ohio [USA], with differing histories of hydrocarbon pollution was examined in relation to the ability to use hydrocarbons. Weathered kerosene was spiked with naphthalene, pristane, 1,13-tetradecadiene,and n-hexadecane and added to water-sediment mixtures from the 3 lakes, and utilization of the 4 marker hydrocarbons was measured. Each of the marker hydrocarbons was metabolized; naphthalene was the most readily used and pristane was the most resistant. Values for dissolved O2 suggest that O2 did not limit hydrocarbon degradation in the water column at any site examined. Nutrient addition studies indicated that N and P limited hydrocarbon degradation at all sites examined. Maximum numbers of heterotrophic bacteria were detected when the water temperature was .gtoreq. 10.degree. C. The data indicate that temperature limits hydrocarbon degradation in the winter, except at a site which had been impacted by an oil spill and which received chronic inputs of hydrocarbons and nutrients. In samples from that site, all 4 marker hydrocarbons were degraded at 0.degree. C. Results of temperature and nutrient-addition experiments suggest that different seasonal populations of hydrocarbon users are selected at that site, but not at other lake sites.																			0095-3628	1432-184X					1985	11	2					127	137		10.1007/BF02010485	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02010485								24221301					WOS:A1985AJY6800004

Relations between phytoplankton quantitative and qualitative characteristics on the one hand, and the main morphometric and physical-chemical parameters on the other were tested by Spearman rank correlation test and multivariate analysis (PCA, CA, RDA, CCA). The total phytoplankton biomass correlated positively with NO3-N, while the relative biomass of flagellates - negatively with the total nitrogen. The CCA showed that morphometric lake characteristics (maximal depth, catchment area/lake area ratio and turbidity) explained a significant part of variations of the phytoplankton taxonomic groups.

J	Jewson, DH; Lowry, SF; Bowen, R				Jewson, David H.; Lowry, Stephen F.; Bowen, Richard			Co-existence and survival of diatoms on sand grains	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												High densities of diatoms were found attached to sand grains down to half a metre below the sediment surface (6.5 g chl a m(-2)) on an exposed beach (Lough Neagh, N. Ireland). However, seasonal variation of biomass was low (11-21 mu g chl a g(-1) dry sand). Sand movement was the main controlling factor but silica and nitrate limitation also contributed during summer months. Laboratory assays showed that nutrients were derived mostly from the overlying water. Two species dominated but with very different strategies for coping in this abrasive environment. Cymbellonitzschia diluviana was small, low growing and aggregated in depressions whereas the larger, non-motile and stalked Martyana martyi was dispersed over the most exposed surfaces. Their contrasting distributions are related to their different structure and modes of cell division. However, one adaptation common to both species was the ability to form resting cells. We investigated the environmental factors controlling the formation and recovery of resting cells using both chloroplast shape and fluorescence indicators. Both species showed a gradual change in and out of the resting state, which enabled them to compromise between the need to conserve energy when buried but recover rapidly when brought back to the surface by wave action and water level changes.																			0967-0262	1469-4433				MAY	2006	41	2					131	146		10.1080/09670260600652903	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09670260600652903													WOS:000238286900001

However, the temporal and spatial patterns of lakes and the related hydroclimatic evolution on the northwestern TP (NWTP) remain unclear. We reconstructed the lake level variations of a non-glacier-fed lake, Longjue Co, on the NWTP, using optical dating of paleo-shorelines. The optically stimulated luminescence signals of quartz grains were unsuitable for dating due to high contributions of the medium component, and thus the post-infrared infrared stimulated luminescence signals (pIR 50 IR 170 , pIR 50 IR 225 ) of K-feldspar single grains were used. Internal checks including dose recovery tests, residual dose tests, and anomalous fading tests showed that the pIR 50 IR 170 signal was suitable for paleo-shoreline dating in Longjue Co. However, some of the samples were affected by the incomplete bleaching of pIRIR signals before deposition, and in this case the Minimum Age Model was used to constrain the ages. We also examined the dependence of the K-feldspar equivalent dose (D e ) on grain brightness and explored the possible mechanisms, and the brightest grains were then used for D e calculations. The results show that Longjue Co reached its maximum Holocene level ( +34 m) during the early Holocene (10.06 +/- 1.39 ka), and then after -5 ka it commenced a shrinking trend, punctuated by two rapid lake level decreases. Reference to independent paleoclimate records suggests that the Holocene lake level variations of Longjue Co and the regional hydroclimate were mainly controlled by the Indian summer monsoon.

Previous studies have researched the effect of environmental factors on phytoplankton and phosphorus release from sediment. However, few studies have simultaneously evaluated the interactive effects of environmental factors on phytoplankton communities and the interactions among different sediment nutrients. This paper reports on a 2016 investigation that examined the phytoplankton community and physical and chemical factors in both the water column and sediments in a Chinese shallow lake and its adjoining rivers. Our results indicated that rivers with water gates and lake areas had greater Chlorophyll a concentrations (Chl a) than natural rivers with similar total phosphorus (TP) concentrations; this indicates the importance of residence time on phytoplankton biomass. Although temperature impacted Chl a less than nutrients, its effects were highly species-specific, modulating relationships between nutrients and the abundance of different phytoplankton taxa. The effects of nutrients changed based on phytoplankton biomass and community composition, suggesting that different phytoplankton taxa have different nutrient demands. We predict that increasing residence time, temperature, and nutrients will increase phytoplankton biomass and increase the future dominance of Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta. In the interstitial water, there were no significant seasonal differences in TP, total nitrogen, and soluble reactive silica concentrations. However, ammonia concentrations were higher in the spring and lower in other seasons; nitrate and sulfate were abundant when the ammonia concentration was low. The total iron level in sediments was significantly negatively related with TP at low ammonia and silica concentrations and at high nitrate and sulfate concentrations in the interstitial water. These results indicated that nutrients are closely coupled in the sediments, highlighting the importance of oxidation-reduction potentials on internal nutrient balance. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Conover, RJ; Gustavson, KR				Conover, RJ; Gustavson, KR			Sources of urea in arctic seas: zooplankton metabolism	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The copepod Pseudocalanus acuspes in the high arctic frequently occurs under fast ice in April and May, where it apparently feeds on ice algae. Excretion measurements for this species in summer from Barrow Strait, Northwest Territories, Canada, showed that urea frequently exceeded ammonia as the primary nitrogenous excretory product. Subsequent experiments in different seasons, also including observations on several other species of arctic zooplankton, notably the copepods Calanus hyperboreus, C. glacialis and Metridia longa, similarly demonstrated high levels of urea excretion. The Calanus spp. showed strong correlation between size (dry weight) and metabolic rates for oxygen consumption and for ammonia excretion, and, for C. glacialis, between size and urea excretion as well. No size-related metabolic relationships were found for P. acuspes, probably because of the small size range of the experimental specimens used. However, P, acuspes and both Calanus species demonstrated striking changes in weight-specific metabolism with season. For all species examined, weight-specific estimates of respiration and excretion frequently yielded O:N ratios less than 20, and occasionally less than 10, when urea and ammonia excretion were combined in the calculations.																			0171-8630						1999	179						41	54		10.3354/meps179041	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps179041													WOS:000080261400004

Coeval Holocene Stalagmites Record Multi-Centennial Climate Variability and Drought in the Northern Rocky Mountains, USA	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The El Ni & ntilde;o Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) are key drivers of cool-season precipitation variability in the western United States (US), including the Rocky Mountains. Together, they help modulate the north-south "precipitation dipole," a regional climate pattern operating on multi-decadal timescales leading to dry conditions north of 40 degrees N latitude when the south is wet, and vice versa. We investigate the natural evolution of this climate pattern using two precisely-dated (5900 years ago to present), multi-proxy, coeval stalagmite records of hydroclimate from Titan Cave, Wyoming, located just north of the modern-day dipole transition zone. Consistent trace element and stable isotope records from the two stalagmites reflect the amount and seasonality of regional precipitation, documenting decreased winter snowfall and dry conditions over multi-decadal intervals characterized by the warm phase of the PDO and more frequent and stronger El Ni & ntilde;o events.

Cyanophages, the viruses that specifically infect cyanobacteria, play a key role in modulating cyanobacterial population, and thus regulate the emergence and decline of cyanobacterial blooms. Here we report a long-tailed cyanophage isolated from Lake Chaohu, termed Mic1, which specifically infects the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa. Mic1 has an icosahedral head of 88 nm in diameter and a long flexible tail of 400 nm. It possesses a circular genome of 92,627 bp, which contains 98 putative open reading frames. Genome sequence analysis enabled us to define a novel terminase large subunit that consists of two types of intein, indicating that the genome packaging of Mic1 is under fine control via posttranslational maturation of the terminase. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis suggested Mic1 and mitochondria share a common evolutionary origin of DNA polymerase gamma gene. All together, these findings provided a start-point for investigating the co-evolution of cyanophages and its cyanobacterial hosts.

The two environments are oligotrophic but subjected to the influence of the river Sanaga that brings them in swelling time new species. Mesocyclops leuckarti found in these lakes suggests the presence of this species on the African continent. The density of the zooplankton organisms increases between September and November and falls quickly in December, in accordance with a seasonal impact on communities. The physicochemical parameters do not differ significantly between the two environments and with the sampling depth. This justifies the value of 82 % obtained with the SORENSEN index. The structure of the populations of zooplankton is principally influenced by the season. The sampling depth, the month and the station do not influence this distribution.

The lake is fed mainly by two distinct water sources. The first is groundwater of Mg-HCO, type and springs of Na-SO, type. The difference in composition of inflow waters is attributed to different ways of water cycling. Ephemeral mudflats around Lake Acigol are composed of gypsum, calcite, dolomite, huntite, together with elastic minerals. Brine-soaked mudflat exist locally and contain efflorescence of halite, bloedite; thenardite and/or mirabilite precipitating from the artesian groundwater; Dominance of aragonite and high TOC values recorded in the gel-like lake sediments are the indicator of bacterial activity in the lake.

Sinninghe			Interannual and (multi-)decadal variability in the sedimentary BIT index of Lake Challa, East Africa, over the past 2200 years: assessment of the precipitation proxy	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												The branched vs. isoprenoid tetraether (BIT) index is based on the relative abundance of branched tetraether lipids (brGDGTs) and the isoprenoidal GDGT crenarchaeol. In Lake Challa sediments the BIT index has been applied as a proxy for local monsoon precipitation on the assumption that the primary source of brGDGTs is soil washed in from the lake's catchment. Since then, microbial production within the water column has been identified as the primary source of brGDGTs in Lake Challa sediments, meaning that either an alternative mechanism links BIT index variation with rainfall or that the proxy's application must be reconsidered. We investigated GDGT concentrations and BIT index variation in Lake Challa sediments at a decadal resolution over the past 2200 years, in combination with GDGT time-series data from 45 monthly sediment-trap samples and a chronosequence of profundal surface sediments. Our 2200-year geochemical record reveals high-frequency variability in GDGT concentrations, and therefore in the BIT index, superimposed on distinct lower-frequency fluctuations at multi-decadal to century timescales. These changes in BIT index are correlated with changes in the concentration of crenarchaeol but not with those of the brGDGTs. A clue for understanding the indirect link between rainfall and crenarchaeol concentration (and thus thaumarchaeotal abundance) was provided by the observation that surface sediments collected in January 2010 show a distinct shift in GDGT composition relative to sediments collected in August 2007. This shift is associated with increased bulk flux of settling mineral particles with high Ti / Al ratios during March-April 2008, reflecting an event of unusually high detrital input to Lake Challa concurrent with intense precipitation at the onset of the principal rain season that year. Although brGDGT distributions in the settling material are initially unaffected, this soil-erosion event is succeeded by a massive dry-season diatom bloom in July-September 2008 and a concurrent increase in the flux of GDGT-0. Complete absence of crenarchaeol in settling particles during the austral summer following this bloom indicates that no Thaumarchaeota bloom developed at that time. We suggest that increased nutrient availability, derived from the eroded soil washed into the lake, caused the massive bloom of diatoms and that the higher concentrations of ammonium (formed from breakdown of this algal matter) resulted in a replacement of nitrifying Thaumarchaeota, which in typical years prosper during the austral summer, by nitrifying bacteria. The decomposing dead diatoms passing through the suboxic zone of the water column probably also formed a substrate for GDGT-0-producing archaea. Hence, through a cascade of events, intensive rainfall affects thaumarchaeotal abundance, resulting in high BIT index values. Decade-scale BIT index fluctuations in Lake Challa sediments exactly match the timing of three known episodes of prolonged regional drought within the past 250 years. Additionally, the principal trends of inferred rainfall variability over the past two millennia are consistent with the hydroclimatic history of equatorial East Africa, as has been documented from other (but less well dated) regional lake records. We therefore propose that variation in GDGT production originating from the episodic recurrence of strong soil-erosion events, when integrated over (multi-)decadal and longer timescales, generates a stable positive relationship between the sedimentary BIT index and monsoon rainfall at Lake Challa. Application of this paleoprecipitation proxy at other sites requires ascertaining the local processes which affect the productivity of crenarchaeol by Thaumarchaeota and brGDGTs.

A study of rivers in Lake Taihu Basin, China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Our study illustrated the ecological conditions in the rivers of Lake Taihu Basin (LTB) using an index of biotic integrity based on phytoplankton (P-IBI), and its performance was compared with the previously developed water quality index (WQI). Samples were collected seasonally at 96 sites covering the major rivers from September 2014 to January 2016. Three critical ecological indices, i.e., phytoplankton density, chlorophyll a (chl a), and Menhinick, were selected from a pool of 22 candidate indices mainly according to the correlations among indices and environmental parameters. The results indicated that the ecological status of LTB based on P-IBI was significantly different at spatial (especially between Tiaoxi and the other 5 river systems) and seasonal scales. Furthermore, the proposed P-IBI effectively identified the major environmental parameters (total nitrogen, ammonium, total phosphorus, and permanganate index) associated with each level (bad, low, and moderate). Moreover, the P-IBI was closely and positively correlated with the WQI at the spatial scale regardless of season. However, the ecological conditions were significantly worse according to the P-IBI at both the spatial (P < 0.001) and seasonal scales (P values of 0.018 in winter and < 0.001 in other seasons, respectively), and the seasonal distribution pattern differed between the two methods. Our study suggests that the P-IBI provides an essential supplement for the assessment of ecological conditions of rivers and that the selected critical indices (phytoplankton density, chl a, and Menhinick) are suitable for river ecosystems. Additionally, compared with WQI, the water quality condition was generally worse when using P-IBI, and this phenomenon requires further attention during water quality assessments, as well as different seasonal distribution patterns.

However, among the world's tropical floodplains, the resources of the TSRL have received little ecological research. Here, we described the spatiotemporal TSRL fish diversity and community variation using daily records from 2012 to 2015 on fish abundance from six sites covering the TSRL system. We found that high fish diversity occurred in sites located in the middle of Tonle Sap Lake, and the lowest diversity was observed in the southern section. The spatial abundance distribution patterns displayed a river-lake gradient, with three fish assemblages that were clustered based on their composition similarities and were characterised by 96 indicator species. In the southern section, fish assemblages were characterised by longitudinal migratory fishes; in contrast, in the middle system, fish assemblages were represented by species with combined ecological attributes (i.e. longitudinal and lateral migratory species and floodplain residents). Towards the northern section, fish assemblages were composed of lateral migratory and floodplain resident species. Species richness and abundance peaked at approximately 2-2.5 and 4months, respectively, after the peak flow in early October, during which Tonle Sap River resumes its normal flow direction (outflow). This suggests that seasonal flood pulses (i.e. rising and falling water levels) play a pivotal role in structuring spatiotemporal variation in the TSRL fish assemblages. Our study has implications for fisheries monitoring and conservation initiatives.					; Grenouillet, Gael/E-6518-2019	Grenouillet, Gael/0000-0003-3588-3694; Ngor, Peng Bun/0000-0002-3659-6577; 													0906-6691	1600-0633				OCT	2018	27	4					1087	1100		10.1111/eff.12417	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12417													WOS:000445181800018

A portion of the population showed helmet cyclomorphosis in 1992, but no helmets developed in 1993. The non-helmeted individuals in 1992 were found in the littoral habitat during summer, whereas the helmeted morph stayed mainly in the pelagial. These differences in morphology and behaviour within and between years are likely to be caused by changes in predation regimes. Larvae of the predacious phantom midge, Chaoborus flavicans, were observed only in 1992, whereas the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, was present both years.																			0018-8158					JUL 7	1995	307	1-3					185	191																WOS:A1995RY51900023
J	Sun, R; Wei, JL; Zhang, SS; Pei, HY				Sun, Rong; Wei, Jielin; Zhang, Shasha; Pei, Haiyan			The dynamic changes in phytoplankton and environmental factors within Dongping Lake (China) before and after the South-to-North Water Diversion Project	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Dongping Lake is one of the most important regulation and storage lakes along the eastern route of the South-toNorth Water Diversion Project in China, the water quality condition of which directly influences the safety of water diverting, because it serves as a Yangtze River water redistribution control point. However, the changes in algae, and in environmental factors affecting their community structures, before and after the water diversion project are rarely reported. In this study, the temporal variations of phytoplankton abundance were examined based on monthly samples collected at three stations from May 2010 to April 2022. The total abundance of algae greatly decreased after the water diversion project was implemented, with a relatively stable biodiversity and evenness before and after the water translocation. Multiple statistical methods were used together with the water quality indices (WQIs) and the nutrient status index (TSIM) to evaluate overall water condition and analyse relationships among environmental factors. The WQIs demonstrated a general "Good" water quality with a seasonal differentiation, and that water conditions during water transfer periods were better than during nonwater transfer periods, which may be ascribed to the improved hydraulic conditions and purified water environment during water transfer periods. Redundancy analysis showed that water temperature, ammonia nitrogen, water transparency, and total phosphorus were the most important environmental factors, with relatively decreased contribution rates towards phytoplankton communities after the water translocation. Importantly, some dominant phytoplankton genera of Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyceae, and Cyanophyceae were similarly affected by water transparency, and nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients in summer after the water translocation. These research findings helped us gain a comprehensive understanding of the changing patterns of water quality and microalgae and their relationships before and after the water diversion project, providing a guidance for future lake management in regulating hydraulic conditions and improving water quality of Dongping Lake.					sun, rong/JRX-7214-2023														0013-9351	1096-0953				APR 1	2024	246								118138	10.1016/j.envres.2024.118138	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2024.118138		JAN 2024						38191041					WOS:001164635400001

Answers show the contribution that clothes, time adaptation and other non thermal effects make in lowering the skin wetness and the perception of warmth. A shift exists between theory (established with subjects in climatic chambers) and statements. Searching for a comfortable feeling in this city, the hottest in France (metropolis), but without any river, lake or seaside, results from water evaporation at the clothing level for the immediate body environment, and also for the outside air cooling. The enormous need of water for a natural air conditioning was one reason for the aqueduct built by the Romans. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Ishikawa, T; Tachihara, K				Ishikawa, Tetsuroh; Tachihara, Katsunori			Age, growth and maturation of the redbelly tilapia Tilapia zillii introduced into the Haebaru Reservoir on Okinawa-jima Island	FISHERIES SCIENCE												The age, growth and maturation of the redbelly tilapia Tilapia zillii introduced into the Haebaru Reservoir on Okinawa-jima Island were studied using 2197 specimens ranging from 7.3 to 168.0 mm standard length (SL). The spawning season was estimated to be from April to August, with a peak in April and May. The first maturation sizes of females and males were estimated to be 38.1 and 33.0 mm SL, respectively. The opaque zones in otoliths that form annually were found to correlate with the spawning season. Maximum ages of females and males were 7 and 6 years, respectively. The von Bertalanffy growth formulae were expressed as: L-t = 99{1 - exp[-0.67(t + 0.09)]} for females and L-t = 155{1 - exp [-0.36(t + 0.12)]} for males. Males grew to be larger than females from the first year onward. Populations of this species are characterized by early maturation life history parameters and are thought to adapt and become established quickly after being released into new water systems. Furthermore, extermination activity in winter is thought to be an effective strategy before the newly recruited fish begin breeding in the warmer months.																			0919-9268	1444-2906				JUN	2008	74	3					527	532		10.1111/j.1444-2906.2008.01555.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1444-2906.2008.01555.x													WOS:000256409200009
J	Schets, FM; Schijven, JF; Husman, AMD				Schets, Franciska M.; Schijven, Jack F.; Husman, Ana Maria de Roda			Exposure assessment for swimmers in bathing waters and swimming pools	WATER RESEARCH												Bathing water compliant with bathing water legislation may nevertheless contain pathogens to such a level that they pose unacceptable health risks for swimmers. Quantitative Microbiological Risk Assessment (QMRA) can provide a proper basis for protective measures, but the required data on swimmer exposure are currently limited or lacking. The objective of this study was to collect exposure data for swimmers in fresh water, seawater and swimming pools, i.e. volume of water swallowed and frequency and duration of swimming events. The study related to swimming in 2007, but since the summer of 2007 was wet and this might have biased the results regarding surface water exposure, the study was repeated relating to swimming in 2009, which had a dry and sunny summer. Exposure data were collected through questionnaires administered to approximately 19 000 persons representing the general Dutch population. Questionnaires were completed by 8000 adults of whom 1924 additionally answered the questions for their eldest child (<15 years). The collected data did not differ significantly between 2007 and 2009. The frequency of swimming and the duration of swimming were different for men, women and children and between water types. Differences between men and women were small, but children behaved differently: they swam more often, stayed in the water longer, submerged their heads more often and swallowed more water. Swimming pools were visited most frequently (on average 13-24 times/year) with longest duration of swimming (on average 67-81 min). On average, fresh and seawater sites were visited 6-8 times/year and visits lasted 41-79 min. Dependent on the water type, men swallowed on average 27-34 ml per swimming event, women 18-23 ml, and children 31-51 ml. Data on exposure of swimmers to recreational waters could be obtained by using a questionnaire approach in combination with a test to measure mouthfuls of water for transformation of categorical data to numerical data of swallowed volumes of water. Previous assumptions on swimmer exposure were replaced with estimates of exposure parameters, thus reducing uncertainty in assessing the risk of infection with waterborne pathogens and enabling identification of risk groups. QMRA for Cryptosporidium and Giardia was demonstrated based on data from previous studies on the occurrence of these pathogens in recreational lakes and a swimming pool. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Olsson, K; Granéli, W; Ripa, J; Nyström, P				Olsson, Karin; Graneli, Wilhelm; Ripa, Jorgen; Nystrom, Per			Fluctuations in harvest of native and introduced crayfish are driven by temperature and population density in previous years	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The effects of temperature and density on annual fluctuations in catches of large adult crayfish are evaluated using time series analysis. We tested if temperature during different stages of the crayfish life cycle influenced observed catches from 1946 to 2007 in Lake Bunn (Sweden). From 1946 to 1974, native noble crayfish (Astacus astacus) inhabited the lake, but then, crayfish plague wiped out the whole population. In 1985, the exotic signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) was introduced and is still present. This made it possible to model the two species separately and compare how temperature and density influence the abundance of large adult crayfish. The best models indicate that both climatic- and density-dependent factors influence the observed fluctuations and there was a time lag for most factors included in the best models. Winter temperature had the strongest influence on fluctuations of both species. Also, density dependence was included in the best model for both species. Growth season for noble crayfish and temperature during the mating season for signal crayfish were also present in the most parsimonious model. Based on our findings, it is difficult to predict how further climate warming will affect crayfish population dynamics in freshwaters.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	2010	67	1					157	164		10.1139/F09-170	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F09-170													WOS:000273522300014

Growth and viability of hatchery-reared Argyrosomus japonicus released into open and semi-closed systems	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												P>Hatchery-reared Argyrosomus japonicus (Temminck & Schlegel) were released into estuaries of varying habitat between 1996 and 2004, and growth and recruitment to the fishery evaluated. Fish stocked earlier in summer had significantly faster growth rates (P < 0.01), and post-stocking mortality ranged from 1.1% to 11.7% within 7 day post-release. Argyrosomus japonicus stocked in the Georges River in 2003 and 2004 yielded fishery independent recapture rates up to 0.2%. For A. japonicus stocked in Smith's Lake in 1997 and 2004, growth rates, timing of recaptures and increases in commercial catches suggested recruitment to the fishery by 18 months. The 1997 stocking led to a 30-fold increase in A. japonicus catch, but stocking was not financially viable, with a cost:benefit ratio of 2.1. Small, shallow coastal lagoons may represent experimental units for refining stocking strategies, but are not optimal for A. japonicus. The potential for density-dependent effects, and complex relationships between growth, habitat and mortality, highlighted the need for a thorough understanding of species - system interactions. Pilot releases can contribute to this understanding, particularly assessment of habitat requirements, and season, site and size-of-release.

J	Psuty, I; Zaporowski, R; Gawel, W				Psuty, Iwona; Zaporowski, Radoslaw; Gawel, Wladyslaw			Goodbye to northern pike (Esox lucius) in the Polish southern Baltic?	FISHERIES RESEARCH												This paper presents compilations of data on commercial fisheries catches of pike on the Polish coast and coastal lagoons in regard to pike stocking and some basic biological data gathered in 2010-2015 in Puck Bay. The decline in commercial pike catches in Polish coastal lagoons began as early as the 1950 s. In Puck Bay, where the species was the dominant predator, the causes of the rapid decline after the mid-1970 s were suggested to be the cut-off of spawning grounds in coastal wetlands and the depletion of underwater meadows. The stocking that has occurred thus far in Puck Bay has had an effect only when using summer fry (8-10 cm TL). In the fishermen's opinion, restocking could be successful only if gillnet fishing was banned for at least 5 years and canals were unblocked for spawners.																			0165-7836	1872-6763				FEB	2023	258								106549	10.1016/j.fishres.2022.106549	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2022.106549		NOV 2022											WOS:000895506500004
J	Rizk, W; Kirillin, G; Leppäranta, M				Rizk, William; Kirillin, Georgiy; Lepparanta, Matti			Basin-scale circulation and heat fluxes in ice-covered lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A field and theoretical study of the mean circulation patterns, gravity currents, and heat fluxes in a mid-latitude, ice-covered lake is presented. Thermistor chains captured the lake-wide pressure gradients and thermal regime, acoustic instruments measured bottom and interior velocities, and a sediment temperature probe measured sediment temperatures and heat fluxes. Typical Rossby numbers showed that the mean circulation was geostrophic, in the form of either an anti-cyclonic or a cyclonic basin-scale gyre. Each gyre reached a steady state after similar to 10-15 d, circulating at a maximum velocity of similar to 1 mm s(-1). The gyres persisted throughout most of the winter and generally decayed with time. The cyclonic gyre was generated by the lateral temperature gradients created by sediment heat release. It was not possible to determine the driver of the anti-cyclonic gyre. Because most ice-covered lakes are controlled by the Earth's rotation, anti-cyclonic and cyclonic circulation is postulated as being the most common mean interior flow pattern. The horizontal heat fluxes were of the same order as the vertical heat fluxes, which is consistent with the findings of previous research. The sediment heat flux decayed with time, stabilizing after similar to 60 d. A scaling analysis of down-sloping advection with dynamic, seasonal-scale temperatures showed that a warmer lake and an increase in the length-to-depth geometric aspect ratio (both within a given lake) and an increase in lake size all increased advection time scales, and therefore circulation time scales, near the boundaries.

J	Tiffany, MA; Ustin, SL; Hurlbert, SH				Tiffany, Mary A.; Ustin, Susan L.; Hurlbert, Stuart H.			Sulfide irruptions and gypsum blooms in the Salton Sea as detected by satellite imagery, 1979-2006	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Bright pale-green surface waters, locally called "green tides," are visible to the naked eye and satellite sensors in patches at the Salton Sea, usually between May and November. These were studied using satellite remote sensing and by direct sampling. Algal blooms are ruled out as a cause as phytoplankton abundance, and chlorophyll concentrations were lower within the patches than in surrounding areas. The presence of abundant microscopic gypsum (CaSO4 center dot 2H(2)O) crystals in surface waters suggests that scattering from this precipitating salt produces the intense signals. Biogeochemical factors include: the decomposition of organic matter, resultant anoxia and production of hydrogen sulfide by sulfate-reducing bacteria at depth, and oxidation back to sulfate and precipitation of gypsum during wind-induced overturn events. Sulfide concentrations following one such event in September 2005 ranged from 0.3 to 2.7 mg l(-1) at the surface and 1.2 to 25 mg l(-1) in bottom waters. Gypsum crystals occurred at densities up to 40,000 ml(-1) in surface water on that date, most 20-30 mu m in length with some as long as 190 mu m. From 1998 to 2006, gypsum blooms appear to have increased in intensity and duration implying an increase in sulfide irruptions and anoxia in surface waters. As much as 97 percent of the lake was affected in early summer of 2003 and 75-80 percent in summers of 2005 and 2006. Events lasted for months at a time during these years. This intensification is likely due to the decline in abundance of a planktivorous fish, a hybrid tilapia, the California Mozambique mouthbrooder, leading to increased algal productivity, more severe anoxia and higher levels of dissolved hydrogen sulfide. Gypsum blooms seem to have occurred at least as far back as the 1970s, and are associated with frequent mass mortalities of fish, plankton and benthos.

J	Ervin, B; Wolfe, G				Ervin, Bryan; Wolfe, Gordon			Acido-thermotolerant fungi from Boiling Springs Lake, LVNP: Potential for lignocellulosic biofuels	AMERICAN MINERALOGIST												Acidic geothermal environments such as those in Lassen Volcanic National Park (LVNP) may provide novel organisms and enzymes for conversion of plant lignocellulose into ethanol, a process that typically requires hot and acidic pre-treatment conditions to hydrolyze cell wall polysaccharides to fermentable sugars. We evaluated seven Ascomycete fungi associated with LVNP's Boiling Springs Lake (BSL) for utilization of lignocellulose material. We screened the fungi for growth pH and temperature optima, and for growth on purified or natural plant cell wall components. We also examined potential lignin degradation using a (per) oxidase assay, and screened for the presence of potential (hemi) cellulose degradation genes with PCR. Growth analysis showed Acidomyces and Ochroconis grew best at 35-45 degrees C and pH <4, and grew up to 48-53 degrees C. In contrast, Aspergillus, Paecilomyces, and Penicillium preferred cooler temperatures for acidic media (25-35 degrees C), but grew up to 48 degrees C. Phialophora only grew up to 27 degrees C under both acidic and neutral conditions, and Cladosporium showed a preference for cool, neutral conditions. The most promising material utilizers, Acidomyces, Ochroconis, and Paecilomyces, used cellobiose and xylan, as well as pine and incense cedar needles, for growth at 40 degrees C and pH 2. Acidomyces and Ochroconis showed extracellular (per) oxidase activity at 40 degrees C and pH 2, and PCR screening showed Acidomyces, Paecilomyces, and Ochroconis contain orthologs to known fungal lignocellulose degradation genes, including glucanases and xylanases. We conclude that the BSL-adapted taxa Acidomyces, Ochroconis, and Paecilomyces may be promising sources of enzymes that combine heat-and acid-tolerance, potentially valuable in streamlining the pre-treatment of lignocellulosic biofuels.																			0003-004X	1945-3027				NOV	2016	101	11					2484	2497		10.2138/am-2016-5552	http://dx.doi.org/10.2138/am-2016-5552													WOS:000388365300010

Design: Ecological study. Setting: Contained geographic area. Patient(s): Resident men presenting for semen analysis or artificial insemination. Intervention(s): Analysis of levels of particulate air pollution (particulate matter [PM] 2.5) over a five-year period in relation to sperm parameters obtained from semen analyses and separately in relation to sequences of sperm parameters at the time of semen preparations for artificial insemination. To account for the duration of spermatogenesis (72 days), "corrected" variables were created by shifting backward 1, 2, 3 and 4 months each of the semen parameters. The final analysis corrected for season of the year and current temperature. Main Outcome Measure(s): Sperm concentration, sperm motility and sperm morphology. Result(s): The study included 1,699 semen analyses and 877 inseminations. PM 2.5 levels were highest in the winter months, when the ambient temperature was the lowest. Semen analysis data showed that values of PM 2.5 were negatively correlated to sperm motility two months and three months following the recording of the PM 2.5 values. Artificial insemination data also showed that sperm motility correlated negatively with PM 2.5 values recorded three months previously. Conclusion(s): Both semen analysis and sperm parameters data obtained from men presenting for multiple inseminations over time showed that air pollution is associated with reduced sperm motility two to three month after exposure.

The two mooring cables damaged were the shorter and stiffer cables located at the ends of the bridge and were likely damaged because of load attraction issues. To improve the performance of the floating bridge during storms, special replacement cables were installed after the 1993 storm near the areas where cable distress was noted. Measurements of cable forces were made during the winter season of 2001-2002 to evaluate the effectiveness of the replacement mooring cables. From the experimental measurements, it was found that the special replacement mooring cables have reduced the load attraction at the shorter end cables with respect to cable tension values reported for the pre-retrofit analysis. However, the measurements indicate that the replacement cables continue to attract loads between 65% and 80% higher than those measured at the longer and more flexible cables located near the midspan of the floating bridge during storm events of approximately the 1-year return period magnitude.																			0361-1981		0-309-08580-2				2003		1845					28	36																WOS:000189298200004

This study was based on observations of seasonal change in its population at a fixed station (water depth ca. 1.3-2.4 m), and on its possible activation of propagules and survivorship of individuals in laboratory cultures. Small living (stained) individuals of A. "beccarii" forma 1 occurred almost throughout the year, most abundantly in February (middle of winter period of three months when the lagoon surface freezes) and June. It is likely that the small individuals of this species are not derived from the reactivation of propagules. The survivorship of young individuals in February to March was lower than in June, suggesting that "young" individuals in the cold period might be more likely to die, compared to during the warm period. In contrast, the > 400 mu m individuals of Lake Saroma were more likely to die at 20 degrees C, although they can survive well at 3 degrees C. Ammonia "beccarii" forma 1 of Lake Saroma appear to exhibit contrasting survivorship behavior between "young" and "adult" individuals in the cold period.																			0272-7714	1096-0015				NOV 30	2019	229								106385	10.1016/j.ecss.2019.106385	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2019.106385													WOS:000501639700001

This construction of the writer's public image is evident in accounts of his stay at the Saranac Lake, NY, tuberculosis sanatorium during the frigid winter of 1887-1888. The institution's distinctive wilderness setting for medical treatment enabled a heroic model of disabled masculinity, one that is framed by American national identity. This archetype informs the author's posthumous reputation and shows how gender and nationality shape metaphoric thinking about illness and authorship.																				2076-0787				AUG	2024	13	4							93	10.3390/h13040093	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/h13040093													WOS:001305273100001
J	Mackay, JR				Mackay, JR			Pingo growth and collapse, Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula Area, Western Arctic Coast, Canada: A long-term field study	GEOGRAPHIE PHYSIQUE ET QUATERNAIRE												Growth data from precise surveys have been obtained for 11 pingos for periods ranging from 20 to 26 years. Most of the 1350 pingos, perhaps one quarter of the world's total, have grown up in the bottoms of drained lakes underlain by sands. Permafrost aggradation on the drained lake bottoms has resulted in pore water expulsion, solute rejection below the freezing front, a freezing point depression, and groundwater flow at below 0 degrees C to one or more residual ponds, the sites of pingo growth. Sub-pingo water lenses underlie many growing pingos. The pure ice which grows by downward freezing in a sub-pingo water lens may be composed of seasonal growth bands which, like tree rings, are of potential use in the study of past climates. Growing pingos underlain by sub-pingo water lenses can often be identified by features such as peripheral pingo rupture, spring flow, frost mound growth, normal faulting, and oscillations in pingo height. Such features, and others, are associated with hydrofracturing and water loss from a sub-pingo water lens. Some of the data derived from the long-term study of pingo growth are relevant to the identification of collapse features, interpreted as paleo-pingos, in areas now without permafrost.																			0705-7199						1998	52	3					271	323		10.7202/004847ar	http://dx.doi.org/10.7202/004847ar													WOS:000078615400001

Biomass accumulated by D. intermedia was not affected by insect availability. In a second experiment, when D. intermedia was grown with ramets of Lysimachia terrestris (L.) BSP., the exclusion of insects significantly reduced the biomass accumulated by D. intermedia. These results suggest that insectivory may be important in reducing the effect of interspecific competition on D. intermedia growing in nutrient-rich habitats.

Two site along the Korean demilitarized zone. Panmunch'om and Ch'olwon, were the most heavily used stopover sites, and they present complex international conservation challenges. Cranes stopped at these sites for up to 87.1% of their total migration time; cranes migrating to Zhalong Nature Reserve, China, made it their only lengthy stop. We report the migration routes and the importance of the identified stopover sites, and we outline conservation issues at those sites.																			0888-8892	1523-1739				JUN	1996	10	3					806	812		10.1046/j.1523-1739.1996.10030806.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1523-1739.1996.10030806.x													WOS:A1996VA57200016

Spatially-explicit foraging by an apex predator linked to nearshore prey and their accessibility in lakes	OIKOS												Habitat coupling - where mobile predators forage over broad spatial scales and, in doing so, link food webs from semi-discrete habitat patches - has emerged as a major structuring force in lake ecosystems. For the cold-water apex predator lake trout Salvelinus namaycush, food-web structure and morphometry-driven accessibility to nearshore areas in summer strongly determine the degree of littoral-pelagic habitat coupling across lakes. Much of the evidence for habitat coupling, however, is based on stable isotopes of carbon to estimate littoral energy acquisition, whereas spatial data directly linking fish movements and foraging behaviour in lakes - on which this theory is based - are limited. Here we estimated nearshore prey abundance at sites of different thermal accessibility and collected stomach content data, which we combined with three-dimensional acoustic telemetry positioning and acceleration data to directly measure the spatial location of summer foraging movements and habitat coupling by lake trout in lakes with and without an offshore prey fish. Both study lakes contained higher abundances of nearshore prey fish at the most thermally accessible (i.e. steep) sites monitored. Nearshore occupancy accounted for a small proportion of lake trout positions in both lakes (<5%), although prey fish were present in most (72%) diets sampled. High acceleration events indicative of foraging were concentrated in steep, thermally accessible nearshore areas in the lake where offshore forage fish were absent, but located further offshore in the lake with offshore prey fish. We directly demonstrate that habitat coupling by a wild, apex predator is driven by habitat and prey accessibility.

Evaluation of Two Different Stocking Rates of Small Walleye Fingerlings in Minnesota Lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We compared the performance of two differing stocking densities of small (mean TL = 72 mm) fingerling Walleyes Sander vitreus in 19 Minnesota lakes. Fingerlings were stocked annually from 2008 to 2011 in June at densities of either 30 (low) or 60 (high) per littoral hectare. Although gill nets yielded low sample sizes, we found no significant difference between gill-net catch rates at age 3 between treatments or years. On average, small Walleye fingerlings contributed 15% (0-72%) to the overall gill-net catches in stocked lakes. In lakes where small fingerlings have had a record of success, we recommend managers stocking this life stage use the lower treatment density (30/littoral hectare) and consider it a maximum rate when seeking stocking efficiencies. Due to low sample sizes, we also recommend following stocking events more closely with other sampling methods, such as fall electrofishing.																			0275-5947	1548-8675					2017	37	6					1243	1248		10.1080/02755947.2017.1365784	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2017.1365784													WOS:000418794000007

No qualitative or quantitative specificity for substrata was observed. Variability of diatom assemblage structure within replicate samples of a particular substratum type was as great as, or greater than, variability between substrata. Diatom assemblages upon dowel rod displayed a mid to late summer density maximum. Variability of density maxima upon natural substrata was attributed to different growth rates of the host macrophytes. Diatom assemblages within each sampling site possessed a distinct temporal periodicity indicating that factors affecting diatom growth are heterogeneous in distribution throughout Lake Erie''s littoral zone.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1983	99	1					7	18		10.1007/BF00013712	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00013712													WOS:A1983QF59300002

We further assessed how well field cyanobacteria quantitative proxies (abundance, toxin concentration, chlorophyll-a and scum formation) used to build a local risk communication system for recreational (bathing) use of waters named "cyano-traffic-light", ongoing since 2011, reflected its outcome. Cyanobacteria abundance in the field ranged from moderate (>20,000 to <100,000 cells mL(-1)) to high-risk (>100,000 cells mL(-1)), and its abundance was positively related to toxin (microcystin) concentration. Mean microcystin concentrations was within the low (=2 mu g L-1, 50% sites) or moderate (>2 < 10 mu g L-1, 50% sites) risk categories. On rare occasions, toxin concentration posed a high-risk for human health. E. coli abundance was within the high-risk category (>126 CFU 100 mL(-1)) for human health, mostly in the northern part of the reservoir. Cyanobacteria proxies (abundance and toxins) and E. coli abundance were, however, unrelated. The predictive model showed that, out of the four cyanobacteria proxies used to construct the cyano-traffic-light only cyanobacteria abundance (p < 0.05) explained the outcome of the reports, yet with low explanatory power (41%). The satellite monitoring allowed delimiting the extent and magnitude of the environmental risk posed by cyanobacteria at landscape scale (highest risk in the meander parts of the Argentinean side of the reservoir) and producing risk maps that can be used by water management agencies. Based upon our results we propose including E. coli abundances and satellite derived cyanobacteria abundances in the building of the cyanotraffic-light, among other modifications.

The fish were exposed either to the naturally fluctuating ambient thermal regime (base, representative of inshore Lake Ontario) or to the ambient regime +2 degrees C (base +2 degrees C). both in the presence or absence of 70 mu mol total ammonia(T-amm)/L (0.013 mg NH3-N/L at 15 degrees C, pH = 7.6). The 90-d exposures lasted from June to September 1994 and were designed to mimic an earlier study in which juvenile rainbow trout were fed to satiation. Relative to the earlier study, the restricted ration markedly increased (4-9-fold) the metabolic costs of nitrogen retention, that is, oxygen consumption per unit protein growth. Rainbow trout from the present study exhibited O-2 consumption, and specific growth rates that were 50-75% and 13-20%, respectively, of the O-2 and growth rates of fish fed to satiation. In addition to the pervasive ration effects, juvenile rainbow trout exposed to +2 degrees C in the present experiment managed to retain more nitrogen for growth, at a slightly decreased energetic cost. Fish exposed to +70 mu mol T-amm/L also exhibited higher energetic costs, but this was accompanied by a comparatively large increase in nitrogen retention efficiency. Thus, their "costs of growth" were substantially reduced. We conclude that a restricted ration of 1%/d will not further impair the ability of juvenile rainbow trout to cope with a chronic small temperature increase. Moreover, sublethal ammonia even may be beneficial under these circumstances.

In this study, temperature data loggers were deployed in several northern Alberta lakes, and the data collected were used to compute the cumulative number of days for which water temperature exceeded the 13.5 degrees C minimum temperature required for yellow perch growth. Tow-net and seine samples of young of the year (age-0 fish) were obtained to describe growth in fork length throughout the summer. Length and degree-day data were used to test the importance of temperature as a determinant of growth. A significant relationship was obtained and validated with data from previous studies of age-0 yellow perch in Manitoba. The importance of temperature was further assessed over a broader geographic range with the use of latitude as a surrogate for temperature and published data on end-of-season lengths. Though not the sole determinant of among-population variability, latitude was found to have a significant effect on growth. Collectively the results suggest that temperature has both a micro- and a macro-scale effect on determining age-0 yellow perch growth.					van+den+Heuvel, Michael/ABF-1188-2020														0002-8487					JUL	1999	128	4					687	700		10.1577/1548-8659(1999)128<0687:AYPGAI>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1999)128<0687:AYPGAI>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000089183800014

After summarising the literature on thermal bar hydrodynamics, a thorough review is made of all plankton observations taken in the presence of a thermal bar. Two distinct plankton growth regimes are found, one with production favoured throughout the inshore region and another with a maximum in plankton biomass near the position of the thermal bar. Possible explanations for the observed distributions are then discussed, with reference to numerical modelling studies, and the scope for future study of this interdisciplinary topic is outlined.

Thus, the composition and seasonal dynamics of the crustacean zooplankton communities of a riverine coastal marsh and the adjoining wave zone of Lake Erie were compared over 13 months. The open waters of the marsh upstream possessed a zooplankton community distinctly different from that in the wave zone, in terms of both the species composition and the population dynamics of some shared species. The downstream end of the marsh possessed a transitional zooplankton community which shared species with both the upstream marsh and wave zone communities and which had intermediate abundances of most species common to both habitats. A small summer storm runoff event briefly disrupted the development of several zooplankton populations in the marsh. Further studies are needed to identify the important factors which influence the marsh zooplankton ecology. Preliminary evidence indicates that the factors probably include planktivory by fishes and Chaoborus, aquatic macrophyte beds, a chemical and chlorophyll gradient from upstream to the lake, persistent high suspended sediments, and the flushing action of storm runoff events.

Here, the temporal clustering of regional-scale extreme precipitation events in southern Switzerland is studied. These precipitation events are relevant for the flooding of lakes in southern Switzerland and northern Italy. This research determines whether temporal clustering is present and then identifies the dynamics that are responsible for the clustering.An observation-based gridded precipitation dataset of Swiss daily rainfall sums and ECMWF reanalysis datasets are used. Also used is a modified version of Ripley's K function, which determines the average number of extreme events in a time period, to characterize temporal clustering on subseasonal time scales and to determine the statistical significance of the clustering. Significant clustering of regional-scale precipitation extremes is found on subseasonal time scales during the fall season.Four high-impact clustering episodes are then selected and the dynamics responsible for the clustering are examined. During the four clustering episodes, all heavy precipitation events were associated with an upper-level breaking Rossby wave over western Europe and in most cases strong diabatic processes upstream over the Atlantic played a role in the amplification of these breaking waves. Atmospheric blocking downstream over eastern Europe supported this wave breaking during two of the clustering episodes. During one of the clustering periods, several extratropical transitions of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic contributed to the formation of high-amplitude ridges over the Atlantic basin and downstream wave breaking. During another event, blocking over Alaska assisted the phase locking of the Rossby waves downstream over the Atlantic.					; Pfahl, Stephan/G-4194-2014	von Waldow, Harald/0000-0003-4800-2833; Martius, Olivia/0000-0002-8645-4702; 													0027-0644	1520-0493				JAN	2016	144	1					347	369		10.1175/MWR-D-15-0205.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-15-0205.1													WOS:000368631600003

With some snowy locales in the U.S. and southern Canada becoming increasingly popular for MW-scale PV systems, lenders are now requiring that snow losses be estimated as part of their energy simulations. The literature is exceptionally thin on this subject we have been unable to find even a single side by side study that directly quantifies the difference between an always-clean array versus an identical one left to naturally accumulate and shed snow [1],[2]. This paper describes the design and reports results for a side by side PV test bed installed in California near Lake Tahoe in December 2009. It has been designed to gauge the energy loss due to snow for three common tilt angles. Results from the first winter are presented, with insights for future model development and ongoing measurements.					; Townsend, Timothy/D-1981-2009	Newmiller, Jeff/0000-0002-3648-3417; 													0160-8371		978-1-4244-5891-2				2010							973	978		10.1109/PVSC.2010.5614572	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/PVSC.2010.5614572													WOS:000287579501044

Daily foraging patterns of adult double-crested cormorants during the breeding season	WATERBIRDS												We recorded the daily presence of Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) at the nesting island on Oneida Lake, New York, by monitoring the activities of 15 radio-tagged adults from July through September, 2000, using an automated data-logging receiver. A total of 24,464 acceptable detections was obtained for adult cormorants actively attempting to nest on the lake. Tagged cormorants had a bimodal daily activity pattern during the first month, with the fewest birds detected on the island at 09.00 h and 15.00 h Eastern daylight time. The pattern of activity appeared to change slightly in the second month of the study, representative of a post-breeding period for the colony, with a shift from a less synchronous pattern of departures to a greater focus on morning activity also centered around 09.30 h. These results correspond with daily observations of Great Cormorant (P carbo) foraging activities reported for colonies in Africa and Poland. The data also support the possibility of nocturnal foraging activity, not previously reported for this species on their summer breeding grounds. No correlation was found between total number of daily detections and climatalogical factors or events.

J	Glova, GJ; Sagar, PM				Glova, GJ; Sagar, PM			Summer spatial patterns of the fish community in a large, shallow, turbid coastal lake	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Several water quality parameters, marginal vegetation, and the fish community in Lake Ellesmere, a large, shallow, turbid lake situated on the east coast of the South Island, New Zealand, were sampled along selected transects in late summer to determine species spatial patterns. Thirteen species of fish were caught, with seven of them comprising major populations, although only four of these were adequately sampled by the method used-they included inanga (Galaxias maculatus), common smelt (Retropinna retropinna), shortfinned eel (Anguilla australis), and common bully (Gobiomorphus cotidianus). Inanga were almost exclusively confined to areas on the western side of the lake which has a convoluted shoreline with a variety of small embayments with scattered vegetation along the margins. Common smelt occupied both marginal and offshore areas, but they too were more abundant along the margins particularly on the western side. Both the common bully and shortfinned eel were widespread and abundant in the lake, although their abundance and biomass were higher within the vicinity of the lake outlet, major inflowing tributaries, and other marginal habitats. All three species of flounders of the genus Rhombosolea were poorly represented in our samples. However, in commercial catches they were reasonably abundant, with the sand flounder (R, plebeia) and yellowbelly (R. leporina) being more common in offshore than inshore catches, whereas the black flounder (R. retiaria) showed no difference in the catches between areas. Our overall findings are consistent with the hypothesis that bottom-dwelling species (eels, bullies, flounders) are more widely distributed than free-swimming forms (inanga, common smelt), which were largely confined to areas sheltered from prevailing winds. The highly turbid nature of the lake, primarily because of re-suspension of fine bottom sediments by frequent winds, is considered an important factor in the distribution of the fish fauna.																			0028-8330					SEP	2000	34	3					507	522		10.1080/00288330.2000.9516953	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.2000.9516953													WOS:000089792300011

Johannes			East Siberian Arctic inland waters emit mostly contemporary carbon	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Inland waters (rivers, lakes and ponds) are important conduits for the emission of terrestrial carbon in Arctic permafrost landscapes. These emissions are driven by turnover of contemporary terrestrial carbon and additional pre-aged (Holocene and late-Pleistocene) carbon released from thawing permafrost soils, but the magnitude of these source contributions to total inland water carbon fluxes remains unknown. Here we present unique simultaneous radiocarbon age measurements of inland water CO2, CH4 and dissolved and particulate organic carbon in northeast Siberia during summer. We show that >80% of total inland water carbon was contemporary in age, but pre-aged carbon contributed >50% at sites strongly affected by permafrost thaw. CO2 and CH4 were younger than dissolved and particulate organic carbon, suggesting emissions were primarily fuelled by contemporary carbon decomposition. Our findings reveal that inland water carbon emissions from permafrost landscapes may be more sensitive to changes in contemporary carbon turnover than the release of pre-aged carbon from thawing permafrost.

Here Dean and colleagues show that in Siberian permafrost, warming could liberate more contemporary carbon relative to aged counterparts.					; Lambert, Thibault/M-7192-2017; Petrov, Roman/J-8965-2016; Vonk, Jorien/H-5422-2011; Borges, Alberto/C-4989-2008; Bouillon, Steven/C-5177-2011; Belelli Marchesini, Luca/M-3554-2014; Röckmann, Thomas/F-4479-2015; Garnett, Mark/C-2377-2009; Dolman, Albertus/B-8552-2012; Maximov, Trofim/J-8964-2016; van Logtestijn, Richardus/B-9680-2009; Dean, Joshua/P-9009-2017; Rockmann, Thomas/F-4479-2015	Martyn Rosco, Melanie/0000-0003-3393-0469; Aerts, Rien/0000-0001-6694-0669; Lambert, Thibault/0000-0002-7666-5370; van Logtestijn, Richardus/0000-0001-9063-2180; Dolman, A.J./0000-0003-0099-0457; Petrov, Roman/0000-0002-6877-3902; Bouillon, Steven/0000-0001-7669-2929; Borges, Alberto V./0000-0002-5434-2247; Belelli Marchesini, Luca/0000-0001-8408-4675; Vonk, Jorien/0000-0002-1206-5878; Meisel, Ove/0000-0002-6431-6659; Garnett, Mark/0000-0001-6486-2126; Karsanaev, Sergey/0000-0002-4055-381X; Dean, Joshua/0000-0001-9058-7076; Rockmann, Thomas/0000-0002-6688-8968; van Huissteden, Jacobus/0000-0001-7730-2793													2041-1723					APR 2	2020	11	1							1627	10.1038/s41467-020-15511-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15511-6								32242076					WOS:000525081200003
J	Della Porta, G; Capezzuoli, E; De Bernardo, A				Della Porta, Giovanna; Capezzuoli, Enrico; De Bernardo, Alessandro			Facies character and depositional architecture of hydrothermal travertine slope aprons (Pleistocene, Acquasanta Terme, Central Italy)	MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY												Hydrothermal travertines develop various depositional geometries, from tabular to high-relief mounds or aprons with steep slopes, under the control of local topography, location and geometry of the vents, fault activity, hydrology, water physico-chemical properties, rates of thermal water flow and carbonate precipitation rates. This study focuses on two Pleistocene, tens of metres thick, travertine slope aprons accumulated on fluvial terraces in the Tronto River Valley (Acquasanta Terme, Central Italy) to investigate their facies character, geochemical signature, porosity and evolution of the depositional geometry through time. The two travertine aprons consist of four aggradational-progradational units, vertically and laterally stacked with onlap and downlap stratal terminations, separated by erosional unconformities produced by events of non-deposition and erosion, due to temporary interruptions of vent activity, shifts of the vent location and/or deviation of the flow directions. The travertine units include various depositional environments: 1) smooth slope, 2) terraced slope with metre-scale sub-horizontal pools separated by rounded rims and vertical walls, and 3) sub-horizontal, tens of metres wide ponds. Smooth slope clinoforms are made of centimetre to decimetre thick layers of crystalline dendrite cementstone, laminated boundstone and radial coated grain grainstone, precipitated by fast-flowing water on inclined substrates. Rims and walls of terraced slopes are built by crystalline dendrites and laminated boundstone. Sub horizontal layers of terrace pools and ponds consist of facies precipitated by slow-flowing to standing water (clotted peloidal micrite dendrite, coated bubble boundstone, raft rudstone) associated with radial coated grains and laminated boundstone. Carbonate coated reeds occur in distal ponds adjacent to toe of slopes or overlie packstone/rudstone with travertine intraclasts and substrate extraclasts, marking events of subaerial exposure and erosion. Travertine facies porosity and permeability range from 4 to 21% and 0.03 to 669 mD, respectively, showing no direct correlation. Stable isotope values (delta C-13: 5.7-9.3%o; delta O-18 9.6%o to 12.2%s) are similar to other travertines precipitated by thermal water in Central Italy. This study identifies the centimetre-scale travertine facies variability linking it to the environment of deposition and to the depositional geometry of travertine units affected by the substrate topography and lateral shifts of the active springs. Despite the different scale and facies composition, the geometry of aggradational-progradational units of travertine aprons might resemble marine flat-topped high-relief carbonate platforms. Travertine units in the subsurface, if present with sizes that can be seismically resolved, might be wrongly interpreted as carbonate platforms with steep slopes without a detailed fades analysis.

Effects of live-well conditions on mortality and largemouth bass virus prevalence in largemouth bass caught during summer tournaments	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We evaluated the effect of improved live-well conditions and the interaction of tournament stress and largemouth bass virus (LMBV) on tournament-associated mortality of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides caught during 12 summer tournaments. Improvements in live-well conditions (reduction in water temperature by 2-5 degrees C; addition of NaCl; continuous aeration) significantly reduced initial mortality of largemouth bass from 7% to 3% (F-1.11= 10.29, P < 0.0 1). However, postrelease mortality of fish held for 5 d in net-pens or raceways was not reduced by the improved live-well conditions and averaged 76% for all tournament fish (F-1.11=0.09, P=0.77). The percentage of angler-caught fish infected with LMBV at the end of tournaments (14%) was significantly higher (P = 0.05) than the percentage infected in the general population (7%). The percentage of LMBV-infected fish increased during the post-tournament retention period to 64% for fish from live wells with improved conditions and 70% for fish from control live wells. Reference fish collected by electrofishing and held with tournament fish for 5 d also had high mortality (59%) and LMBV prevalence (47%), but these variables were significantly lower than those for tournament fish (mortality: F-2.30 = 3.63, P = 0.04; prevalence [Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test]: P < 0.01). Many of the fish also had bacterial diseases during the post-tournament period, so the effect of LMBV on postrelease mortality could not be determined. However, the higher postrelease mortality of tournament and reference fish in our study relative to that observed in previous tournaments on lakes presumed free of LMBV suggests that this newly discovered pathogen influences measurement of post-tournament mortality. Increases in LMBV prevalence after typical fishing tournaments without prolonged post-tournament fish confinement will probably be lower than those we observed, but further research on the effects of LMBV on fish released from tournaments is warranted.

Hydrologic and Landscape Controls on Dissolved Organic Matter Composition Across Western North American Arctic Lakes	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Northern high-latitude lakes are hotspots for cycling dissolved organic carbon (DOC) inputs from allochthonous sources to the atmosphere. However, the spatial distribution of lake dissolved organic matter (DOM) is largely unknown across Arctic-boreal regions with respect to the surrounding landscape. We expand on regional studies of northern high-latitude DOM composition by integrating DOC concentrations, optical properties, and molecular-level characterization from lakes spanning the Canadian Taiga to the Alaskan Tundra. Lakes were sampled during the summer from July to early September to capture the growing season. DOM became more optically processed and molecular-level aromaticity increased northward across the Canadian Shield to the southern Arctic and from interior Alaska to the Tundra, suggesting relatively greater DOM incorporation from allochthonous sources. Using water isotopes (d(18)O-H2O), we report a weak overall trend of increasing DOC and decreasing aromaticity in lakes that were hydrologically isolated from the landscape and enriched in d(18)O-H2O, while within-region trends were stronger and varied depending on the landscape. Finally, DOC correlated weakly with chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) across the study sites, suggesting that autochthonous and photobleached DOM were a major component of the DOC in these regions; however, some of the northernmost and wetland-dominated lakes followed pan-Arctic riverine DOC-CDOM relationships, indicating strong contributions from allochthonous inputs. As many lakes across the North American Arctic are experiencing changes in temperature and precipitation, we expect the proportions of allochthonous and autochthonous DOM to respond with aquatic optical browning with greater landscape connectivity and more internally produced DOM in hydrologically isolated lakes.					; Aukes, Pieter/LRU-7463-2024; Wickland, Kimberly/AAU-2963-2021; Kyzivat, Ethan/HDO-0105-2022; Smith, Laurence/E-7785-2012; Spencer, Robert/ADE-1993-2022; Savage, Phillip/A-6829-2008; Butman, David/T-9380-2019	Frey, Karen/0000-0002-8745-1298; Kurek, Martin/0000-0002-6904-5253; Dornblaser, Mark/0000-0002-6298-3757; Wickland, Kimberly/0000-0002-6400-0590; Kyzivat, Ethan/0000-0002-4748-2938; Smith, Laurence/0000-0001-6866-5904; Striegl, Robert/0000-0002-8251-4659; McKenna, Amy/0000-0001-7213-521X; Aukes, Pieter/0000-0003-0759-2187; Niles, Sydney/0000-0002-3487-6612; Garcia-Tigreros, Fenix/0000-0001-8694-9046; 													0886-6236	1944-9224				JAN	2023	37	1							e2022GB007495	10.1029/2022GB007495	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022GB007495													WOS:001000099400002

The LCC over the TPLG in the summer of 1979-2020 exhibited a sudden shift of increased interdecadal variation in 1995. The abnormal increases in evaporation and whole-layer specific humidity, and the abnormal convergence of 400 hpa water vapor flux, led to an increase in water vapor over the TPLG, which increased the LCC. The water vapor budget shows that the increase is the most significant along the southern boundary. The cyclonic circulation anomaly in the southwest of the TPLG can transport water vapor to the region. The southerly wind and upward wind anomalies in the south favored water vapor transport through the climbing effect. The water vapor budget at the eastern boundary of the TPLG had the highest correlation coefficient with LCC on the interdecadal scale. The anticyclonic circulation anomaly over Lake Baikal inhibited the outflow of water vapor across the eastern boundary. The anticyclonic circulation was associated with the Rossby wave train. The interdecadal warming of sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean-Black Seas played roles in the maintenance of the Rossby waves. The Rossby wave train propagated upward and eastward from the low layer to 200 hpa in the positive anomaly area of the Rossby wave source. The positive anomaly centers of the Rossby wave source were over the North Atlantic, the area around the Black Sea, and the southeastern region of Lake Baikal.

However, our understanding of this event's influence on Korea's climate remains limited, with most existing studies focusing on China. To investigate this phenomenon, we analyzed diatom records from the past 9000 years and monitoring data from the subalpine Sara-oreum wetland on Jeju Island, influenced by the East Asian monsoon. Our findings indicate that the 4.2 ka event had humid conditions, as evidenced by tychoplanktonic species observed in both Saraoreum and Muljangori-oreum wetlands, which typically appear in summer. Comparisons with monsoonal China suggest reduced summer monsoon precipitation in northern China but increased rainfall in southern China, likely due to shifts in the westerly jet, prolonging the rain belt over southern China and influencing Korea. Furthermore, the principal component 1 axis and sand content, both indicators of lake level indicator, strongly correlated with delta 18O records from Xianglong Cave and the Westerlies Effect Index from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, suggesting that diatom data from Sara-oreum could serve as a valuable indicator of the westerly jet's influence in Korea. This study enhances our understanding of past climatic events and their potential impact on global monsoon patterns. Future research could further explore the broader implications of these findings for climate dynamics and adaptation strategies.					; CHO, A Ra/GXV-3648-2022	Jun, Chang-Pyo/0000-0002-6626-7918; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				MAR 1	2025	661								112730	10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.112730	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.112730		JAN 2025											WOS:001399143100001

Consequently, the oasis deposition sediments play a pivotal role in the study of regional paleoenvironmental changes and the exploration of prehistoric human-environment interactions. The YSD and STM sections, both typical aeolian-lacustrine sections located at the edge of the Tarim Basin, were investigated in this study. By analyzing optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating results and grain-size proxy indicators, the environmental evolution patterns in the Tarim Basin since approximately 2.2 ka BP were reconstructed. Additionally, the parametric end-member analysis on the grain-size data was conducted to explore the environmental significance revealed by each end-member. The research findings indicate that: (1) similar to 2.2-1.8 ka B.P., sediment morphology and grain-size parameters indicate that the climate in the Tarim Basin recorded by the STM section was relatively dry, with rivers gradually receding and frequent sand-drift activities. During the development of the YSD section (similar to 1.67-1.5 ka B.P.), the environmental conditions in the Tarim Basin transitioned to a relatively humid phase, with the Yarkand River experienced multiple episodes of natural diluvial deposition. The grain-size data of two sections both comprise five sedimentary dynamic components, serving as sensitive indicators of regional humidity conditions and winter monsoon intensity. (2) The oasis development in the Tarim Basin during the late Holocene (particularly refers to between similar to 2.2 ka B.P. and similar to 1.4 ka B.P.) exhibits a significant positive correlation with temperature records. (3) Environmental changes and human activities jointly regulate the spatial and temporal distribution and number of archeological sites during the development of both sections. However, the dominance of the two factors varied across different historical periods.

J	Schmidt, SR; Lischeid, G; Hintze, T; Adrian, R				Schmidt, Silke R.; Lischeid, Gunnar; Hintze, Thomas; Adrian, Rita			Disentangling limnological processes in the time-frequency domain	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												State variables in lake ecosystems are subject to processes that act on different time scales. The relative importance of each of these processes changes over time, e.g., due to varying constraints of physical, biological, and biogeochemical processes. Correspondingly, continuous automatic measurements at high temporal resolution often reveal intriguing patterns that can rarely be directly ascribed to single processes. In light of the rather complex interplay of such processes, disentangling them requires more powerful methods than researchers have applied up to this point. For this reason, we tested the potential of wavelet coherence, based on the assumption that different processes result in correlations between different variables, on different time scales and during different time windows across the seasons. The approach was tested on a set of multivariate hourly data measured between the onset of an ice cover and a cyanobacterial summer bloom in the year 2009 in the Muggelsee, a polymictic eutrophic lake. We found that processes such as photosynthesis and respiration, the growth and decay of phytoplankton biomass, dynamics in the CO2-carbonate system, wind-induced resuspension of particles, and vertical mixing all occasionally served as dominant drivers of the variability in our data. We therefore conclude that high-resolution data and a method capable of analyzing time series in both the time and the frequency domain can help to enhance our understanding of the time scales and processes responsible for the high variability in driver variables and response variables, which in turn can lay the ground for mechanistic analyses.

The Late Quaternary sediment successions of Llangorse Lake, south Wales	PROCEEDINGS OF THE GEOLOGISTS ASSOCIATION												The last British-Irish Ice Sheet (BIIS) created a landscapewithmany sedimentary basins that preserve archives of paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic change during the Last Glacial-Interglacial Transition (LGIT; similar to 18-8 ka BP). The typical lithostratigraphic succession of these archives is composed of minerogenic/allogenic sediments formed during cold climatic conditions and organic-rich/authigenic sediments during warmer climates. This paper presents a multi-core lithostratigraphy compiled from the extant lake and surrounding basin at Llangorse Lake, south Wales, a basin lying within the southernmost limits of the last BIIS. This lake contains one of the longest continuous terrestrial sediment successions in the UK. Uncertainty previously existed concerning the presence and distribution of sediments at the site related to the Windermere Interstadial (similar to 14.7 to similar to 12.9 ka BP) and Loch Lomond Stadial (similar to 12.9 to 11.7 ka BP). A new borehole survey demonstrates that LGIT-age sediments are present at the site with nekron mud (gyttja), corresponding to the Lateglacial Interstadial, deposited in the deeper part of the lake waters and that these deposits are equivalent in age to marl deposits found at shallower depths at the margins of the basin. These deposits are associated with warmer conditions experienced during the Windermere Interstadial and Holocene, whilst minerogenic-rich sediments were deposited during the colder climatic conditions of the Dimlington Stadial and the Loch Lomond Stadial with rangefinder radiocarbon dates confirming this attribution. A model of lake level changes shows that drainage of the Dimlington Stadial glacial lake caused the largest fall, but there was also a further, smaller lake level fall at the end of the Windermere Interstadial and/or the start of the Loch Lomond Stadial, before the level rose in the early Holocene. The lithostratigraphic results presented here form the framework for further paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic research at Llangorse Lake. (C) 2021 The Geologists' Association.

Phenology of alpine zooplankton populations and the importance of lake ice-out	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The prolonged ice cover inherent to alpine lakes incurs unique challenges for aquatic life, which are compounded by recent shifts in the timing and duration of ice cover. To understand the responses of alpine zooplankton, we analyzed a decade (2009-2019) of open-water samples of Daphnia pulicaria and Hesperodiaptomus shoshone for growth, reproduction and ultraviolet radiation tolerance. Due to reproductive differences between taxa, we expected clonal cladocerans to exhibit a more rapid response to ice-cover changes relative to copepods dependent on sexual reproduction. For D. pulicaria, biomass and melanization were lowest after ice clearance and increased through summer, whereas fecundity was highest shortly after ice-off. For H. shoshone, biomass and fecundity peaked later but were generally less variable through time. Among years, ice clearance date varied by 49 days; years with earlier ice-out and a longer growing season supported higher D. pulicaria biomass and clutch sizes along with greater H. shoshone fecundity. While these large-bodied, stress tolerant zooplankton taxa were relatively resilient to phenological shifts during the observation period, continued losses of ice cover may create unfavorably warm conditions and facilitate invasion by montane species, emphasizing the value of long-term data in assessing future changes to these sensitive ecosystems.

The environmental variables recorded in Lake Oahe included monthly and total yearly inflows and outflows, end-of-month elevations, yearly mean end-of-month elevations, and 13 degreesC and 15 degreesC habitat volumes. Biological variables included gill-net catch per unit effort (CPUE) of lake herring Coregonus artedi, rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax, and chinook salmon (for age-0, age-1 and older, and all fish); chinook salmon age-1 mean relative weight; and rainbow smelt abundance in both the 13 degreesC and 15 degreesC habitat volumes. Chinook salmon fecundity was significantly related to rainbow smelt CPUE (r = 0.841) and chinook salmon CPUE (r = 0.853), Fecundity was also significantly related to mean relative weight of age-1 and older salmon collected in gill nets the year before spawning (r = 0.892), Embryo survival to the eyed stage was significantly related to May inflows m(3)) into Lake Oahe during the year of spawning fr = 0.662) and to October inflows in the year before spawning (r = 0.674). Egg Size was significantly related to reservoir elevations (reservoir volumes) in March, April, and May from the year before spawning (r = 0.774, 0.794, and 0.765, respectively). The relationships observed may be indicative of dietary influences, particularly rainbow smelt productivity and availability. on chinook salmon reproduction. Hatchery personnel can use the regression equations to predict the number of female chinook salmon that need to be spawned and the number of eggs to be incubated to meet the production requests of fisheries managers.																			1522-2055	1548-8454				JAN	2001	63	1					58	65		10.1577/1548-8454(2001)063<0058:EIOLFC>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8454(2001)063<0058:EIOLFC>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000167944700010

In the nearshore (southshore and eastern basin), zooplankton abundance decreased and shifts occurred in the relative abundances of Bosmina longirostris and Daphnia retrocurva (eastern basin) and Daphnia retrocurva and Daphnia galeata mendotae (southshore). These changes could have resulted from increased vertebrate predation or reduced food resources which intensified the effects of predation. In the offshore, the first appearance (FA) of the larger, less common cladoceran species occurred earlier in the season as of 1985. FA was correlated with cumulative epilimnetic temperature (CET) and the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) greater-than-or-equal-to 165 mm caught in U.S. waters in the spring. In 1987, when CET was high and CPUE of alewife greater-than-or-equal-to 165 mm was low, large populations of these cladocerans developed in June and July. Bythotrephes cederstroemi, a recent invader in the Great Lakes, was abundant only in 1987 when the CPUE of alewife was lowest. Changes in zooplankton abundance, development, and composition along the nearshore-offshore gradient reflected effects of temperature, habitat, and planktivory on the community.																			0706-652X					AUG	1991	48	8					1546	1557		10.1139/f91-183	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f91-183													WOS:A1991GC70700023

To evaluate the occurrence, temporal variations, and ecological risk of antibiotics in five crab ponds of Lake Guchenghu Basin, China, 44 antibiotics from nine classes were analyzed by rapid resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (RRLC-MS/MS). Twelve antibiotics belonging to six classes were detected in the aqueous phase of five crab ponds, among which sulfonamides and macrolides were the predominant classes, and six compounds (sulfamonomethoxine, sulfadiazine, trimethoprim, erythromycin-H2O, monensin, and florfenicol) were frequently detected at high concentrations. In general, the antibiotic levels varied between different crab ponds, with the average concentrations ranging from 122 to 1440 ng/L. The antibiotic concentrations in crab ponds exhibited obvious seasonal variations, with the highest concentration and detection frequency detected in summer. Multivariate analysis showed that antibiotic concentrations were significantly correlated with environmental variables, such as total organic carbon, phosphate, ammonia nitrogen, and pH. Sulfadiazine, clarithromycin, erythromycin-H2O, and ciprofloxacin posed a high risk to algae, while the mixture of antibiotics could pose a high risk to aquatic organisms in the crab ponds. Overall, the usage of antibiotics in farming ponds should be comprehensively investigated and controlled to preserve a healthy aquaculture ecosystem.

Measurements of grain size, magnetic susceptibility (MS), total nitrogen (TN), total organic carbon (TOC), total inorganic carbon (TIC), atomic TOC/TN(C/N) and carbonate content were conducted in order to reconstruct the climate since similar to 3700 cal a BP. In addition to a regional drying trend in the late Holocene, closely related to the weakening of the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM), four distinct climatic stages can be identified. (i) From 3700 to 2909 cal a BP, a semi-arid and cool climate dominated the lake area, with a transitory climatic amelioration from 3300 to 3150 cal a BP. (ii) The interval from 2909 to 2589 cal a BP was characterized by a rising temperature and the recovery from drought. (iii) From 2589 to 1903 cal a BP, drought conditions were renewed and significantly intensified in a cold environment. (iv) After 1903 cal a BP, a warm climate with severe evaporation accelerated the shrinking of Qrdin Nuur. A comparison of our results with other paleoclimatic records, mainly from southern Inner Mongolia, reveals similar climatic trends and highlights the asynchronous nature of the regional climatic transition to increased aridity, which was reflected by the activation of the Otindag sandy land and by the dominance of steppe landscapes. Several multi-centennial temperature oscillations are recognized over the last two millennia, as inferred from fluctuations in TIC and carbonate content. We correlate the warm interval from 853 to 560 cal a BP (1097-1390 AD) with the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), and the consequent cold interval from 560 to 128 cal a BP (1390-1822 AD) with the Little Ice Age (LIA). Furthermore, the climatic reconstruction shows that the lake area was generally drier during the LIA than in the MWP. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Epidemiology of Bonamia in the UK, 1982 to 2012	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS												Bonamiasis, caused by Bonamia ostreae, was confirmed in native flat oysters Ostrea edulis L. in England in 1982. Hudson & Hill (1991; Aquaculture 93: 279-285) documented investigations into the initial spread of the disease in wild and cultivated stocks of native oysters in the UK. They also described the controls that were initially applied to prevent the further spread of the pathogen. This paper reports on subsequent controls and associated monitoring applied in the UK and reports on the epidemiology of the disease in the 30 yr from 1982 to 2012. Bonamiasis remained confined to the zones in England as documented by Hudson & Hill (1991) until 2005, when it was confirmed in Lough Foyle, Northern Ireland. In 2006 it was found in 2 new areas, one in Wales and one in Scotland. Subsequent further spread to additional areas in all parts of the UK has resulted in 9 zones being currently designated as infected with the disease. In addition, a single oyster from one area has tested positive for the closely related B. exitiosa. In general, analysis of the results of the monitoring programme in England and Wales shows no clear trend in infection levels over time, although there has been an apparent decrease in the level of infection in some fishery areas. In an autumn sampling programme the highest levels of infection were detected in October.

Occurrence of the First Toxic Microcystis Bloom in a Recent Moroccan Reservoir	WATER RESOURCES												In order to understand initial conditions that promote the first occurrence of a Microcystis aeruginosa bloom and to evaluate its toxic potential, we studied spatio-temporal dynamics of phytoplankton, including Microcystis, microcystins concentrations, the relative proportion of potentially microcystin producing cells and physicochemical parameters in the recently setup Moroccan reservoir "Yaacoub Al Mansour." High summer temperatures, thermal stability, hydrological stability of the water column and the decrease of nutrient contributions seem to be the major environmental factors responsible of this first bloom occurrence. Despite the low cellular abundance, high microcystins concentrations, associated with low percentage of toxic strains, were measured. Thus, microcystins analysis and associated management of the reservoir are necessary from the beginning of the setup and can help managers to find the better environmental strategy against early cyanobacteria proliferations.

Regarding the epidemiological role of leptospirosis the rodent population was investigated because rats and mice were often seen in the surrounding area. 11 rats and 20 mice could be trapped. From their urine or kidneys two leptospiral serovars were isolated: Serovar capenhageni from Rattus norvegiens and serovar saxkoebing from Clethrionomys glareolus. Leptospiral antibody titers were not detected in one of these infected animals. It may be supposed that the Leptospira interrogans serovar copenhageni out of the Serogroup leterohaemorrhagiae had caused the leptospiral infection of the patient.																			0005-9366	1439-0299				NOV	1995	108	11					405	407											8593131					WOS:A1995TJ40900002
J	Zhi, YJ; Shao, MQ				Zhi Yijin; Shao Mingqin			Population Size and Sex Ratio of Wintering Scaly-Sided Merganser Mergus squamatus in the Poyang Lake Water System, Jiangxi Province, China	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The line transect method was used to examine the population size and sex ratio of the scaly-sided merganser Mergus squamatus (the merganser) in four rivers of the Poyang Lake water system, Jiangxi province, China. Spatial and temporal variations in population size were ascertained for this endangered species. The Xiuhe, Fuhe and Raohe river systems exhibited large steady populations, with the maximum size ranging from 25 to 68 individuals for each river. Restoration and maintenance of suitable habitats for the scaly-sided merganser is imminent as the species is at risk of extinction due to its small population size. The total sex ratio of the merganser during the study period was 0.397 (n = 790) and the average sex ratio was 0.43 +/- 0.26 (n = 148) for each group, similar to the results obtained in previous years in Jiangxi province (0.378-0.4588). These data indicate that the wintering sex ratio of the merganser has been relatively steady over this period. The current results also revealed temporal and spatial variation in the sex ratio of mergansers, which is common among other duck species. The lower sex ratio in Xiuhe River indicated that the population in this river may include more sub-adults. Long-term data should be collected to test whether female mergansers are more likely to migrate north. The sex ratio of the merganser exhibited a tendency to decrease gradually from the early to late stages in each river, although only the Raohe River exhibited a significant difference among three stages, possibly due to differences in sexual migration time and mortality. We did not detect significant differences in the sex ratio of the scaly-sided merganser among different group sizes.																			0030-9923					JUN	2019	51	3					1067	1073		10.17582/journal.pjz/2019.51.3.1067.1073	http://dx.doi.org/10.17582/journal.pjz/2019.51.3.1067.1073													WOS:000468849500035

THE DIVERSITY, EXTRACELLULAR ENZYMATIC ACTIVITIES AND PHOTOPROTECTIVE COMPOUNDS OF YEASTS ISOLATED IN ANTARCTICA	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY												The diversity of yeasts collected from different sites in Antarctica (Admiralty Bay, King George Island and Port Foster Bay and Deception Island) and their ability to produce extracellular enzymes and mycosporines were studied. Samples were collected during the austral summer season, between November 2006 and January 2007, from the rhizosphere of Deschampsia antarctica, ornithogenic (penguin guano) soil, soil, marine and lake sediments, marine water and freshwater from lakes. A total of 89 isolates belonging to the following genera were recovered: Bensingtonia, Candida, Cryptococcus, Debaryomyces, Dioszegia, Exophiala, Filobasidium, Issatchenkia (Pichia), Kodamaea, Leucosporidium, Leucosporidiella, Metschnikowia, Nadsonia, Pichia, Rhodotorula, and Sporidiobolus, and the yeast-like fungi Aureobasidium, Leuconeurospora and Microglossum. Cryptococcus victoriae was the most frequently identified species. Several species isolated in our study have been previously reported to be Antarctic psychophilic yeasts, including Cr. antarcticus, Cr. victoriae, Dioszegia hungarica and Leucosporidium scottii. The cosmopolitan yeast species A. pullulans, C. zeylanoides, D. hansenii, I. orientalis, K. ohmeri, P. guilliermondii, Rh. mucilaginosa, and S. salmonicolor were also isolated. Five possible new species were identified. Sixty percent of the yeasts had at least one detectable extracellular enzymatic activity. Cryptococcus antarcticus, D. aurantiaca, D. crocea, D. hungarica, Dioszegia sp., E. xenobiotica, Rh. glaciales, Rh. laryngis, Microglossum sp. 1 and Microglossum sp. 2 produced mycosporines. Of the yeast isolates, 41.7% produced pigments and/or mycosporines and could be considered adapted to survive in Antarctica. Most of the yeasts had extracellular enzymatic activities at 4 degrees C and 20 degrees C, indicating that they could be metabolically active in the sampled substrates.

It is also important to understand how future climatic changes and other environmental conditions may influence the transition of dominant algae, and the frequency and severity of blooms. In this study, the transition of dominant algae in Lake Kitaura was analyzed using a three-dimensional hydrodynamic-ecosystem-coupled model. Lake Kitaura is part of Lake Kasumigaura in Japan, and is connected to Lake Nishiura and Lake Sotonasakaura. Dominant algae have shifted seasonally and annually between 2005 and 2009, between three major algal: Microcystis spp., Planktothrix spp., and Cyclotella spp. Numerical simulation was carried out for the four years of the period 2005-2009. The model reproduced well the transitions of dominant algae in the four years by calibrating ecological parameters. The biomass of Planktothrix spp. suddenly increased in the summer of 2008, and Planktothrix spp. became the dominant species. Longer periods of stratification. lower concentration of dissolved oxygen, and higher concentration of dissolved nitrogen were observed in 2008, while the sudden increase in Planktothrix spp. biomass in 2008 was likely caused by transport of algae into the lake from lake Nishiura via Wani River.

To estimate the region-wide glacier budgets for three study sites covering the region extending from West-Geladandong to Bugyai Kangri, we compared 1968/1969 topographic maps, the 2000 SRTM DEM, and recent ASTER DEMs for glacier mass budget calculations. Between similar to 1969 and similar to 2015, the specific mass budget was -0.31 +/- 0.05 m w.e. a(-1) for the entire Tanggula Mountains, which is lower than the global average. This ongoing mass loss is mainly caused by increasing summer temperatures since the 1960s. Heterogeneous glacier behavior can be explained by a combination of factors, including meteorological conditions, proglacial lakes, and surge-type glaciers.

The species fail into three groups: conifers, evergreen broad-leaf plants and ornamentals. The lake is considered to be the major factor in climate control. The snow line of the surrounding mountains coincides with the limits of cultivation of Olea europaea ssp. sativa and also with the limits of the Quercus-Ilex community. The material to be studied was collected in different seasons at Riva and transported by train to Innsbruck where it was treated according to the methods of Pisek and Schiessel (1947). No seasonal difference in frost resistance could be determined in the two palms, Chamaerops humilis and Trachycarpus fortunei. When subjected to cold during summer these two species were only surpassed by Citrus trifoliata shoots in frost resistance (-10[degree]C and -13[degree]C, respectively). On the other hand Olea europaea requires some exposure to cool temperatures before frost resistance becomes effective. Frost resistance could not be related to osmotic values and is assumed to be controlled by some endogenous process which increases the protoplasmic resistance.																			0032-0935	1432-2048					1954	44	6					607	635		10.1007/BF01937602	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01937602													WOS:A1954YA18900003
J	Bai, P; Wang, YS				Bai, Peng; Wang, Yongsheng			The Importance of Heat Storage for Estimating Lake Evaporation on Different Time Scales: Insights From a Large Shallow Subtropical Lake	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The change in heat storage (G(c)) is an essential component of a lake ' s energy balance, and its importance for lake evaporation (E-w) has been widely recognized. However, the effect of G(c) on Ew exhibits diversity across time dimensions. The controls on G(c) and the effects of G(c) on Ew estimates at different time scales remain largely unexplored. To address these gaps, we identified the primary controls on G(c) at an eddy covariance site in a large shallow lake (Lake Taihu) and quantified the role of G(c) in estimating Ew on three (hourly, daily, and monthly) time scales based on two energy balance-based E-w models. Our results indicate that the diurnal variation of G(c) is dominated by net radiation and peaks around noon, while the seasonal variation of G(c) is mainly controlled by air temperature and peaks in spring. In contrast, the daily variation of G(c) is subjective to a confluence of factors-net radiation, wind speed, and relative humidity-displaying more stochasticity than that on the other two time scales. We also found that the importance of G(c) for E-w estimates decreases as the time scale extends. Compared to the two models disregarding G(c), considering the effect of G(c) enhances the average Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) values of the two models by 1.33, 0.42, and 0.08 on the three time scales, respectively. Overall, this study highlights the importance of time scales in evaluating the effect of G(c) on E-w estimates.					; Wang, Yongsheng/ABX-1675-2022	Bai, Peng/0000-0001-9711-7069; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				SEP	2023	59	9							e2023WR035123	10.1029/2023WR035123	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023WR035123													WOS:001062495500001

Remotely-sensed based estimation of the gross primary production (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) of rice paddy fields is essential to assess global food security. In this study, we tested the application of a recently proposed remotely-sensed based water-carbon coupled model (PML-V2) in the lower reaches of the Poyang Lake plain, which is one of the nine production bases for crops in China. Evaluation using the eddy covariance measurements showed that, after parameter localization, the model reproduced the seasonal variations of GPP and ET for both the early rice and the late rice. The model performed reasonably well in the validation period because the key parameters (e.g., the quantum efficiency and the stomatal conductance coefficient) exhibited predictable seasonal variations. At the regional scale, the spatial distribution in multi-year GPP of rice (1365 +/- 326 gCm(-2)year(-1)) can be explained by the vegetation cover fraction (R-2 > 0.9); in comparison, the multi-year ET (1003 +/- 65 mm/year) exhibits smaller spatial variations due to the high evaporation rate of the saturated soil surface of paddy fields. The water use efficiency of rice in this region varies around 1.35 gC/kgH(2)O with a standard deviation of 0.30. Our study shows that GPP and ET of rice can be estimated by remote sensing models without detailed crop management information, which is usually unavailable at regional scales.					; Fan, Xingwang/H-6348-2019; ZHOU, Han/JKH-8389-2023	LIU, Yuanbo/0000-0002-8780-927X; Fan, Xingwang/0000-0003-0099-1839; Zhou, Han/0000-0002-0162-4443; Gan, Guojing/0000-0002-4683-5121; 														2072-4292				SEP	2021	13	17							3470	10.3390/rs13173470	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13173470													WOS:000694476600001

The bedrock of the valley containing dolomite and gypsum determines the chemistry of the water. The lake basin was created by glacial erosion and originally dammed by a glacial moraine. The water body is structured in 3 distinct layers, the oxic mixolimnion, the anoxic monimolimnion and a narrow chemocline in between. The water masses of the lake are stabilized by density differences of salt-rich water which is constantly supplied by subaquatic springs to the monimolimnion. In contrast the mixolimnion is fed by electrolyte-poor surface water. Sulfate, hydrogen carbonate, calcium and magnesium are the dominant ionic species. In the monimolimnion sulfide concentrations of more than 1 mM are found. The chemocline at a depth of 10 to 13 m is characterized by steep chemical and physical gradients. It contains dense populations of up to 10(5) cells/mL of phototrophic sulfur bacteria consisting of predominantly Chromatium okenii, C. minus and Amoebobacter purpureus. The lake has proven to be an excellent model system for studies of the role of planktonic bacteria which dominate the sulfur cycle.																			1015-1621	1420-9055					2001	63	1					70	90		10.1007/PL00001345	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/PL00001345													WOS:000167989200005

Decoupling of the Organic and Inorganic Lacustrine Carbon Cycles on the Chinese Yunnan Plateau in Response to Human Activities	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												As anthropogenic impacts to both climate and freshwater resources continue to intensify in coming decades, an increasing number of lakes will experience carbon cycle perturbations. An examination of lakes that have experienced such perturbations for millennia can clarify the nature and severity of carbon cycle disturbances. Lakes precipitating carbonate minerals provide an opportunity to use measurements of both inorganic and organic carbon isotopes to detect the relationship between the inorganic and organic carbon cycles. We examine these dynamics among three lakes in Yunnan, China, which have been impacted by human activities for the last 1,500 years. We compare the period impacted by people to drying conditions and lowering lake levels during the middle Holocene, and more stable hydrologic conditions during the later Holocene, both of which are characterized by minimal anthropogenic influence. From 5,500 to 3,500 years BP, decreased precipitation, increased evaporation, and changes in vegetation drove increases in sediment carbon isotope values. Despite continued weakening of the Indian monsoon from 3,500 to 1,500 years BP, carbon isotopes values stabilized. Following anthropogenic manipulation of lake levels after 1,500 years BP, and despite differences in the magnitude of activities in the three catchments, a decrease in inorganic carbon isotopes without a parallel change in organic carbon isotopes is a pervasive feature in each system and a clear signature of human activity. We suggest possible drivers are an influx of dissolved inorganic carbon from either oxidized organic matter or dissolved carbonates from the watershed and/or the respiration of lake sediment organic matter.

J	Larsen, DJ; Crump, SE; Blumm, A				Larsen, Darren J.; Crump, Sarah E.; Blumm, Aria			Alpine glacier resilience and Neoglacial fluctuations linked to Holocene snowfall trends in the western United States	SCIENCE ADVANCES												Geological evidence indicates that glaciers in the western United States fluctuated in response to Holocene changes in temperature and precipitation. However, because moraine chronologies are characteristically discontinuous, Holocene glacier fluctuations and their climatic drivers remain ambiguous, and future glacier changes are uncertain. Here, we construct a continuous 10-thousand-year (ka) record of glacier activity in the Teton Range, Wyoming, using glacial and environmental indicators in alpine lake sediments. We show that Teton glaciers persisted in some form through early Holocene warmth, likely as small debris-covered glaciers or rock glaciers. Subsequent Neoglacial ice expansion began similar to 6.3 ka, with two prominent glacier maxima at similar to 2.8 and 0.1 ka that were separated by a multicentennial phase of ice retreat. Comparison with regional paleoclimate records suggests that glacier activity was dominantly controlled by winter precipitation variability superposed on long-term Holocene temperature trends, offering key insights into western U.S. glacier resilience and vulnerability to future warming.

Occurrence and incidence of Prunus necrotic ringspot virus, Arabis mosaic virus, and Apple mosaic virus on oil rose (Rosa damascena) in the Lakes region of Turkey	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF CROP AND HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE												This study was carried out during 200607 in oil rose (Rosa damascena) production areas in the Lakes region of Turkey. During the months of April and August, leaf samples showing virus and virus-like symptoms were collected periodically from rose plantations. During surveys, photos of typical virus symptoms were taken. A total of 218 samples from 10 oil rose growing plantations were collected. All samples were tested for Prunus necrotic ringspot virus (PNRSV), Arabis mosaic virus (ArMV), and Apple mosaic virus (ApMV) using double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA). Among the samples tested, ArMv, PNRSV, and ApMV were found in 51.8%, 35.7%, and 17.8% of the collection, respectively. Serological tests also indicate that ArMV is the most common virus on oil rose varieties. Mixed infections of ArMV+PNRSV, ArMV+ApMV, PNRSV+ApMV, and ArMV+PNRSV+ApMV were also detected in the rose samples tested. An infection by ArMV, PNRSV, and ApMV, either singly or in combination, is usually responsible for rose mosaic disease. However, mixed infections of PNRSV and ArMV were detected in 54 rose samples tested. Inoculation with extracts from ArMV-positive plants produced systemic vein banding on Cucumis sativus, chlorotic local lesions on French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), and systemic mosaic on cowpea (Vigna unguiculata). Inoculation with extracts from PNRSV-positive plants produced systemic mosaic, stunting, and vein banding on C. sativus, and necrotic local lesions on cowpea. Inoculation with extracts from ArMV-positive plants produced necrotic local lesions on Chenopodium amaranticolor and Chenopodium quinoa, and chlorotic local lesions, mottling, and systemic mosaic on C. sativus. As a result, the existence of ArMV, PNRSV, and ApMV were found in this region. This is the first study of the occurrence and incidence of ApMV on oil rose in Turkey. In addition, symptoms caused by Rose spring dwarf virus and Rose rosette virus were observed in these plantations.																			0114-0671	1175-8783				JUN	2009	37	2					95	98		10.1080/01140671.2009.9684247	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01140671.2009.9684247													WOS:000269403300002

Simultaneously, the Mediterranean area witnessed the establishment of the Mediterranean-type seasonal precipitation rhythm (summer drought). These important climate changes produced significant vegetation changes, such as the extinction of several thermophilous and hygrophilous plant taxa from the European latitudes. Besides these long-term trends, climate was also characterized by cyclical variability (i.e., orbital changes) that forced vegetation changes (forested vs. open vegetation). In the Mediterranean area, cyclical changes in the vegetation were mostly forced by precession. In this study we analyzed pollen from a Late Pliocene maar lake core from NE Spain. An increase in aridity is observed as well as cyclic variations throughout the studied sequence. Cyclicity was mostly forced by precession but also by obliquity and eccentricity. Precipitation seems to be the main factor controlling these cycles. These data allowed estimating a sedimentary rate of ca. 0.19 mm/yr and the time duration covered by the studied core, close to 200 ka. The combination of biostratigraphy, palaeomagnetism and cyclostratigraphy allowed for a very precise dating of the sediments between ca. 3.3 and 3.1 Ma. Climate and paleobiogeographical implications are discussed within the context of the Late Pliocene Northern Hemisphere glacial intensification. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	Cordell, JR; Morrison, SM				Cordell, JR; Morrison, SM			The invasive Asian copepod Pseudodiaptomus inopinus in Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia estuaries	ESTUARIES												At least six species of Asian copepods have been recently introduced to the west coast of North America. Among them is Pseudodiaptomus inopinus, which became established and abundant in the Columbia River estuary between 1980 and 1990. Subsequently, the tidal regions of 18 smaller rivers in the Pacific Northwest were sampled, using near-bottom pumps and vertical plankton net hauls. These samples indicate that II inopinus has not only invaded at least seven other estuaries in this region, but that it is sometimes the dominant zooplankter in these systems. P. inopinus occurred in estuaries of both large and small rivers and in rivers with and without international shipping. Two factors may be important in the establishment of this copepod: temperature and extent of salinity intrusion. In our samples, average autumn temperature of rivers with established P. inopinus populations was 19.3 degrees C, whereas those without P. inopinus had an average temperature of 12.4 degrees C. Rivers with II inopinus had salinity intrusion zones of more than 1 km length and those without P. inopinus usually had intrusion zones of less than 1 km.																			0160-8347					SEP	1996	19	3					629	638		10.2307/1352523	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1352523													WOS:A1996VP80600011
J	Sangewar, CV				Sangewar, C. V.			Remote sensing applications to study Indian glaciers	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												Indian Himalayan Glaciers are located in mostly inaccessible terrain. There are 9575 glaciers spread over the Indian Himalaya from northwest to its eastern limits (Sangewar C.V. and Shukla S.P., 2009. Inventory of the Himalayan glaciers - a contribution to the International Hydrological Programme (an updated edition) [Spl. Pub., No. 34]. Kolkata: Geological Survey of India, 588.). Approach to glaciers is often difficult and hazardous and is a constraint in undertaking frequently field-based studies. Moreover, majority of these glaciers is unapproachable. Besides glaciers, de-glaciated regions are the potential areas for generation of glacier-related hazards, viz. ice avalanches, rock fall, glacial-lake outbursts (GLOF), blocking of rivers especially due to surging glaciers, avalanches or a debris fall, etc. and is a cause of concerns to the downstream area with ongoing climate change scenario. Remote sensing techniques, especially in its modern outlook having a sub-metre resolution have altogether changed the present scenario for glacier/snow-related studies. Once the type area within a basin is studied with conventional field techniques (Mukherjee, B.P. and Sangewar C.V., 1996. Correlation of accumulation area ratio and equilibrium line altitude with the mass balance of Gara, Gor garang and Shaune garang glaciers of Himachal Pradesh. In: Proceedings of symposium on NW Himalaya and Foredeep, February 1995 [Special Publication No. 21(2)]. Kolkata: Geological Survey of India, 303-305.), the data can be extrapolated to other areas with much higher confidence level. Thus, in minimal time frame larger area can be studied simultaneously. The studies that can be undertaken with remote sensing includes geomorphology and palaeoglaciation studies, recessional pattern of glaciers in different climatic zone and altitude wise, mass balance of glaciers in a catchment and regionally, documenting surging glaciers, glacier induced hazards in different regions, etc. However, applications of remote sensing should not be used indiscriminately, and a vast field exposure is a must before attempting such studies to avoid possible inaccuracies. The technique is being successfully applied by the author during the course of various glaciological studies in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Sikkim Himalaya.																			1010-6049						2012	27	3			SI		197	206		10.1080/10106049.2011.617841	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2011.617841													WOS:000314593600002

Currently, the dual frequency Ku (13.5 GHz) and L-band (1.3 GHz) instrument is focused on making backscatter and phase measurements of snow and ice on land and lakes to estimate total snow accumulation. This paper describes the core system characteristics, the instrument operation, and SAR data processing that is conducted to achieve science ready data. We illustrate the system's capability to produce science-ready data using examples from a field experiment conducted in Ontario during the winters of 2022-23 and 2023-24. CryoSAR flights were made over a farm field site and a lake site in Ontario with field measurements. Calibrated Ku and L-band polarimetric data are presented and illustrate the sensitivity of the signals to surface and backscatter processes on the ground.																			2153-6996		979-8-3503-6033-2; 979-8-3503-6032-5				2024							6559	6561		10.1109/IGARSS53475.2024.10642350	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS53475.2024.10642350													WOS:001415226901104

This creek is a Mississippi River alluvial stream, which includes six riverine lakes in an intensively cultivated 44 260-ha watershed. Low concentrations of pesticides were persistent in surface waters of the creek from the headwaters to the confluence with the Yazoo River with no significant differences in concentrations between sites on the creek or in isolated offstream lakes. Pesticide concentrations increased during periods of maximum runoff, which corresponded with the winter rainy season and minimum vegetative cover on the soil. Seven years after spraying had ceased, DDT was still available to surface waters and aquatic biota by way of eroded soil from farm fields and from deposited sediments in stream and lake bottom. No significant declines in concentrations of DDT in surface waters were found in comparisons with two earlier studies nor were any declines in surface water contamination noted during this 3-yr study.																			0047-2425	1537-2537				JAN-MAR	1987	16	1					69	72		10.2134/jeq1987.00472425001600010014x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1987.00472425001600010014x													WOS:A1987F738200014

In this paper the concentrations of six PAHs in water, seston and copepods were examined in a harbour zone of the Genova Gulf (Ligurian Sea) from November 1997 to June 1998. The importance of freshwater inputs coming from a polluted stream and the influence of seasonal and atmospheric factors were also considered. Highest PAH values were recorded during spring. Fluoranthene, Benzo[b]fluoranthene and Benzo[k]fluoranthene were the most abundant PAHs either in water, seston or copepods. The concentration of total PAHs in seawater was often lower than the detection limit: recorded values ranged between 0.001 and 0.06 ppb. In seston, total PAHs ranged between 0.033 and 6.26 ng(.)g(-1) and in copepods between 0.01 and 2.34 ng(.)g(-1). With this study, PAH contamination in the harbour zone of Genova Sestri-Ponente and the importance of inputs of organic pollutants coming from land and freshwaters have been emphasized.

Cold Season Performance of the NU-WRF Regional Climate Model in the Great Lakes Region	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												As Earth's largest collection of freshwater, the Laurentian Great Lakes have enormous ecological and socioeconomic value. Their basin has become a regional hotspot of climatic and limnological change, potentially threatening its vital natural resources. Consequentially, there is a need to assess the current state of climate models regarding their performance across the Great Lakes region and develop the next generation of high-resolution regional climate models to address complex limnological processes and lake-atmosphere interactions. In response to this need, the current paper focuses on the generation and analysis of a 20-member ensemble of 3-km National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-Unified Weather Research and Forecasting (NU-WRF) simulations for the 2014/15 cold season. The study aims to identify the model's strengths and weaknesses; optimal configuration for the region; and the impacts of different physics parameterizations, coupling to a 1D lake model, time-variant lake-surface temperatures, and spectral nudging. Several key biases are identified in the cold-season simulations for the Great Lakes region, including an atmospheric cold bias that is amplified by coupling to a 1D lake model but diminished by applying the Community Atmosphere Model radiation scheme and Morrison microphysics scheme; an excess precipitation bias; anomalously early initiation of fall lake turnover and subsequent cold lake bias; excessive and overly persistent lake ice cover; and insufficient evaporation over Lakes Superior and Huron. The research team is currently addressing these key limitations by coupling NU-WRF to a 3D lake model in support of the next generation of regional climate models for the critical Great Lakes Basin.

Based on the relationship, we have reconstructed the environmental and vegetation history from sediments from Zhuye Lake. located in the marginal area of the Asian monsoon. During the Late Glacial (before similar to 13 cal ka BP), the high content of sand is correlated with low pollen concentrations, which implies an and environment and low vegetation cover in the drainage. The relatively high percentages of Pinus and Quercus pollen, derived from nearby high elevations, may indicate particularly low vegetation cover in the lower part of the watershed. Between 13 and 7.7 cal ka BP, increasing silt content is correlated with high percentages of Picea pollen. Fluvial flow and effective humidity at high elevations, as well as lake-level, all increase. Following this, an abrupt environmental change which is likely caused by some change in lake geomorphology persists for about 300 years. The Holocene Optimum is between 7.4 and 4.7 cal ka BP in this region. Pollen concentrations reach their highest values in the section. The abundant herb pollen reflects the high vegetation cover in the lower part of the watershed. The silt and the fine components in the sediments are high and stable indicating optimal moisture conditions. Between 4.7-1.5 cal ka BP the lake-level fell and silty peat was formed at the site. The pollen concentration decreased in contrast to the high pollen concentration in the Holocene Optimum. In the last 1500 years the lake-level fell while terrestrial sediments were deposited at the site. In this phase Chenopodiaceae, Nitrarla and Ephedra reach their highest values in the section reflecting an and environment. In Zhuye Lake and the surrounding area environmental changes are mainly controlled the combined effects of the East Asian monsoon and the Westerlies since the Late Glacial. In the last similar to 1.5 cal ka BP the intensive and trend may be correlated with changes in the Westerlies. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A Population Model to Assess Influences on the Viability of the Shortnose Sturgeon Population in the Ogeechee River, Georgia	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Southern populations of the federally endangered Shortnose Sturgeon Acipenser brevirostrum are considered to be at greater risk of extirpation than northern populations. Our study focused on the Ogeechee River, Georgia, a small, undeveloped, coastal river that supports a population with fewer than 300 Shortnose Sturgeon. We designed a population viability analysis (PVA) model to represent and quantify the demographic influences of three factors (poor water quality, intrusion of saline water via rice canals, and incidental harvest) on the viability of this population. As an isolated population, only 75% of simulated populations persisted beyond a 20-year time horizon with all factors simulated. However, immigration from the Altamaha River may help to support the population. We quantified population persistence with and without simulating each factor and found that (1) incidental harvest had no effect on simulated persistence, (2) poor water quality decreased simulated persistence by 29%, primarily due to low oxygen conditions in summer, and (3) roughly one-third of this effect was attributed to rice canals (premature exposure of juveniles to high salinities). Simulated recruitment to age 1 was limited by a habitat squeeze between density-dependent starvation upstream near the spawning grounds and premature exposure to salinity downstream. These results highlight a need for research on availability of summer refuge and freshwater rearing habitat. As these results derived from a PVA model, which required many assumptions, they should be considered preliminary. Further field research is needed to confirm those results where it is possible to test intermediate predictions. We conclude by suggesting that efforts to maintain or increase the number of viable populations of Shortnose Sturgeon in southern U.S. rivers will probably require an understanding of (1) source-sink dynamics between populations in rivers with access to adequate freshwater rearing habitat and those without, and (2) the effects of climate change.

The one-dimensional bio-optical model of water ecosystem dynamic is used. The aim of the investigation is to simulate few suggested factors influence, which were proposed as possible reasons lead to full extinction of diatoms during cold climates. Effects of silicon influx change, winter period duration, ice optical properties variability and glaciers-generated suspended matter impact are studied. It is shown that diatoms production is highly sensitive to optical properties of ice and suspended matter influence. The most probable reason for diatoms extinction during cold climates is glacier-generated suspended matter optical impact.																									1998							1031	1036																WOS:000078339600106

Today, many lines of evidence indicate that inland East Asia experienced persistent aridification after the middle Miocene Climate transition. However, chemical weathering records from the South China Sea as well as late-Miocene paleolake expansions in northeastern Tibet contrast with the idea of long-term aridification after the middle Miocene Climate transition. Here, we present manganese-to-iron ratios and clay mineral contents of sediments formed approximately 14 to 10 million years ago from the Guide Basin, northeastern Tibetan Plateau, combined with previously published records (lithology, magnetic susceptibility, redness, and strontium content). Our results show that a paleolake in the Guide Basin expanded between approximately 11.4 and 10.5 million years ago, opposite to the long-term drying trend after the middle Miocene Climate transition. On the 100-kilo-year eccentricity scale, our results demonstrate alternating moisture source variability in northeast Tibet, with precipitation predominantly delivered via the westerlies and the East Asian summer monsoon. This variability could potentially be related to the movement of the westerly jet over the Tibetan Plateau. After comparison to climate model simulations, we attribute this movement to astronomical forcing and the waxing and waning of the Antarctic ice sheet. A rise in lake levels occurred after the mid-Miocene climate transition, challenging the notion of persistent long-term aridity and indicating a significant influence of westerly winds and East Asian summer monsoons, according to paleorecords and climate models from the northeastern Tibetan Plateau.					; Abell, Jordan/AAB-5589-2021; Cao, Mengmeng/JFA-9946-2023	Han, Wenxia/0000-0001-5129-8714; 														2662-4435				OCT 3	2024	5	1							556	10.1038/s43247-024-01710-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s43247-024-01710-2													WOS:001328612100006
J	OSTROFSKY, ML				OSTROFSKY, ML			PHOSPHORUS SPECIES IN THE SURFICIAL SEDIMENTS OF LAKES OF EASTERN NORTH-AMERICA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Species of phosphorus, total iron, and organic matter were determined from surficial profundal sediments of 66 lakes of eastern North America. The lakes represented a broad range of lake type, from oligotrophic and eutrophic and from soft water to moderately alkaline. The sediment characteristics were less variable than the lake characteristics. Highly significant correlations were found between percent loss on ignition and sedimentary organic phosphorus and between sedimentary iron and NH4Cl-extractable, NaOH-extractable, HCl-extractable, total inorganic, and total phosphorus in the sediments. There was no relationship between spring total phosphorus or alkalinity and any sediment character measured. The results suggest that lakes with high sedimentary iron have disproportionately higher concentrations of NH4Cl and NaOH-extractable phosphorus, two species that are most likely to contribute to internal loading of phosphorus.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAY	1987	44	5					960	966		10.1139/f87-114	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f87-114													WOS:A1987H969100004
J	KONOVALOV, SM				KONOVALOV, SM			PARASITES AS INDICATORS OF BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO SOCKEYE-SALMON (ONCORHYNCHUS-NERKA)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												This paper reviews the applicability of parasites as indicators in studying the biology of their hosts, using examples drawn primarily from the extensive research that has been conducted on the sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) by scientists of the former Soviet Union and Canada. The data obtained by these researchers has contributed to our knowledge of the feeding and wintering migrations of populations, i.e., local stock complexes, of sockeye and other Pacific salmon. In some local stocks of sockeye salmon, millions of fish carry such biological tags as specific parasites and scale marks that facilitate the study of their seasonal migrations. Parasite indicators are also useful in distinguishing fish of various subpopulations and trophic groups within populations of freshwater species, while an analysis of the parasite fauna of juvenile fish may reveal those fish hosts that inhabited the river in the recent geological past but are now locally extinct. In regulating subpopulations of sockeye salmon, parasites are the effect rather than the cause of mortality. The above examples are evidence of the successful application of parasites for studying biological processes.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1995	52			1			202	212		10.1139/f95-528	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f95-528													WOS:A1995RW48200030
J	Leclerc, EL				Leclerc, Elizabeth L.			Coast and highland paleoclimate of the north-central Peruvian Andes and its influence on coastal water availability and cultural development, 6000 to 2000 cal BP	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Paleoclimate records from highland and coastal contexts are synthesized for Peru's north-central coast with a focus on the period from 6000 to 2000 cal yr BP. Around 6000 cal yr BP, both the highlands and coast experienced considerable climatic change. Increased precipitation in the southern tropical Andes ended a long period of aridity, resulting in higher lake levels and renewed glacial activity. Meanwhile, the north and central coasts experienced a major shift in the El Nin(similar to)o-Southern Oscillation that may have accompanied a change in background sea surface temperatures. Between 4000 and 3500 cal yr BP, glaciers began to retreat even as the South American Summer Monsoon strengthened, signaling a shift to warmer temperatures and continued increases in highland precipitation. Around 3000 cal yr BP, El Nin(similar to)o abruptly increased in frequency to near-modern intervals, with more frequent rain events on the coast and greater climate variability in the highlands, including notable periods of drought. This synthesis highlights areas in which more work is needed to improve understanding of paleoclimate change and its effects on water availability, including disentangling the effects of precipitation and temperature on water balance, reconstructing changes in coastal humidity, and investigating the relative influence of coastal and highland climate regimes over the middle elevations of the western Andean slope.

J	Fritz, M; Bachofen, R				Fritz, M; Bachofen, R			Volatile organic sulfur compounds in a meromictic Alpine lake	ACTA HYDROCHIMICA ET HYDROBIOLOGICA												The full spectrum of volatile sulfur compounds was detected in the water column of the permanently stratified meromictic Lake Cadagno. Besides hydrogen sulfide it included methanethiol, carbonyl sulfide, dimethyl sulfide, carbon disulfide, and dimethyl disulfide. Their distribution in the water column suggests that these compounds are of biogenic origin. Except for carbon disulfide which is present in all layers of Lake Cadagno, these volatile organic sulfur compounds are restricted to the anoxic part of the lake. For methanethiol, dimethyl sulfide, and carbon disulfide maximum concentrations were observed in the redox transition zone and in the sediment porewater. Carbon disulfide is the most abundant volatile organic sulfur compound with concentrations of up to 60 mu mol L-1. The concentrations of the methylated sulfides are in the nmolar range. Although their concentrations varied during the summer months, seasonal trends of the concentrations of volatile organic sulfur compounds did not follow a consistent pattern. The restriction of most sulfur species to the anoxic layers of the lake indicates that their production originates from anaerobic microbial degradation of biomass and not from its release from a specific precursor like dimethylsulfoniumpropionate as in marine environments.																			0323-4320					AUG	2000	28	4					185	192		10.1002/1521-401X(20004)28:4<185::AID-AHEH185>3.0.CO;2-V	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1521-401X(20004)28:4<185::AID-AHEH185>3.0.CO;2-V													WOS:000088953200002

Mass removal by seining of this species from infected waters is a labor-intensive task that requires knowledge of their behavior and popular aggregation locations. It has been shown that carp tend to aggregate and slow down during winter months leaving them potentially vulnerable to seining. In 2010, Hennen used a fixed telemetry system to track carp movement during ice-cover periods and reported on their spatial distributions. Expanding on this work, we propose a model to describe the discrete movement of carp through a fixed telemetry system using a Bayesian Hierarchical Markov model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In the Saba River Basin and three caldera lakes (Tamblingan, Buyan, and Bratan) locating near the basin in the north of Bali Island, Indonesia, the delta D and delta O-18 in fresh rainwater, river water, spring water, the surface water of several paddy plots with ponding, and lake surface water were measured from 2012 to 2014. In the middle and the lower areas of this basin, paddy fields are predominant land use. In contrast, in the upper area, plantation and forest are major, while paddy fields are very limited. All the delta D-delta O-18 regression relationships in the upper river water, the spring water, and the fresh rainwater reasonably agreed with the Bali rainwater line (BRL), which is the "meteorological water line" specified for Bali (Kayane in water cycle and water use in Bali Island. Dissertation, Institute of Geoscience, University of Tsukuba, 1992). The regression lines for the paddy surface water [Paddy Line (PL)] and for the caldera lakes water (Lake Line), both of which had high correlation, could be significantly differentiated each other and also from the BRL. Almost all the plotted points of delta O-18 vs. delta D in the middle and the lower river waters containing discharge from paddy fields were located in a range between the BRL and the PL on a delta-diagram. Although further investigations are still needed, we concluded that it is possible to quantitatively assess the relationship between return flow from paddy fields and river regime, algebraically. In addition, according to the same logic, it was assumed with high possibility that the water in Lake Tamblingan adjacent to the Saba River Basin is flowing into the Panas River, which is a branch river of the Saba, beyond the basin boundary.																			1611-2490	1611-2504				JUL	2019	17	3			SI		463	473		10.1007/s10333-019-00742-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10333-019-00742-1													WOS:000478759100019
J	ROBERTS, D				ROBERTS, D			A CONTEMPORARY SMALL-SCALE THRUST-FAULT NEAR LEBESBY, FINNMARK	NORSK GEOLOGISK TIDSSKRIFT												A displaced drillhole in phyllites in a road-cut at Skogvika, Lakesfjord, Finnmark, shows a reverse-fault offset of 5.8 cm, the thrust vector directed towards 118-degrees. The thrust-fault parallels the 40-degrees dipping, axial surface slaty cleavage of Caledonian folds. The displacement has occurred at some time during the 3-year period between the summers of 1986 and 1989. It is suggested that this very recent reverse slip, which is about coaxial with the contemporary, regional, horizontal compressive stress in northern Fennoscandia, can be explained as resulting from a release of accumulated strain energy, triggered either by a seismic event or perhaps by the actual blasting of the road-cut. Aseismic creep may also have contributed to the overall finite displacement.																			0029-196X						1991	71	2					117	120																WOS:A1991GB61600005
J	BUTLER, MG; ANDERSON, DH				BUTLER, MG; ANDERSON, DH			COHORT STRUCTURE, BIOMASS, AND PRODUCTION OF A MEROVOLTINE CHIRONOMUS POPULATION IN A WISCONSIN BOG LAKE	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												A three-year life cycle was determined for a population of Chironomus tenuistylus, the predominant benthic macroinvertebrate in a small, dystrophic lake in northern Wisconsin, by analyzing larval size and developmental stage distributions on eight dates over a two-year period. The coexistence of three discrete cohorts could be recognized clearly only during the short September emergence period. At other seasons, we could not separate two cohorts within the final instar due to overlapping larval sizes and similar developmental states. Frequent hypoxic or anoxic conditions at the bottom of this sheltered, poorly mixed bog lake apparently limited Chironomus growth and development to brief intervals, prolonging the life cycle and leading to a multi-cohort population structure. Most growth, development, and emergence occurred in the fall when peak annual temperatures coincided with highest levels of dissolved oxygen. Biomass showed relatively low temporal variation (1.9-7.2 g/m2) over the two years, and annual production was estimated at 4-5 g/m2 by cohort and P/.hivin.B methods. Failure to recognize the long cohort production interval and three-cohort structure of this population could result in substantial errors if production were estimated with non-cohort methods.																			0887-3593					JUN	1990	9	2					180	192		10.2307/1467450	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1467450													WOS:A1990DP18700006
J	Stoeckmann, AM; Garton, DW				Stoeckmann, AM; Garton, DW			A seasonal energy budget for zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in western Lake Erie	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We constructed a balanced energy budget for zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) from the western basin of Lake Erie during the active growth and reproductive season (May-October). We measured metabolic costs (oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion), body mass change, and feces production weekly and marked mussels to quantify shell growth. Costs of reproduction were measured by inducing spawning four times using serotonin and collecting gametes. After conversion to calories, all energy budget components were combined with published length-frequency distributions and mussel densities to estimate population consumption. We estimated that individual zebra mussel consumption averaged 3.16 cal.day(-1) (1 cal = 4.1868 J). Metabolic costs account for >90% of energy consumption. Mussels <15 mm increased in body mass whereas mussels >15 mm allocated energy to reproduction in lieu of somatic growth. Our estimates of population consumption were sensitive to mussel size distribution, with the most abundant size-class responsible for the greatest proportion of population consumption. Based on published estimates for primary production in western Lake Erie, our energy budget estimated that zebra mussels (10 000 - 50 000 mussels.m(-2)) potentially consume an equivalent of 10-50% of summer primary production.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				DEC	1997	54	12					2743	2751		10.1139/cjfas-54-12-2743	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-54-12-2743													WOS:000072533200002

While altered precipitation regimes are recognized as critical climate multipliers, their hierarchical controls on cyanobacterial harmful algal bloom dynamics remain poorly quantified, particularly in stratified reservoirs. Here, we integrate a 60-yr (1961-2020) trend analysis of rainfall extremes with 4 yr (2017-2020) of high-frequency monitoring of hydrology, nutrients, and phytoplankton through manual sampling and autonomous buoys in Lake Qiandaohu, a deep subtropical reservoir vital for drinking water in eastern China. Using Mann-Kendall trend analysis, random forest, and partial least squares path modeling, we elucidate the hierarchical mechanisms linking altered rainfall regimes to phytoplankton community shifts, with a focus on cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms. Our results reveal significant increases in both annual rainfall and rainstorm frequency over the past six decades, with peak events coinciding notably with early summer agricultural fertilization. Intensified early summer rainstorms triggered disproportionate phosphorus loading, significantly lowering N/P ratios and transiently suppressing cyanobacterial dominance. However, a critical approximately 20-d lag period followed these events, wherein rapid thermal stratification recovery, combined with persistent legacy nutrients, selectively favored cyanobacterial proliferation. Furthermore, subsequent continuous dry-hot spells amplified cyanobacterial dominance by enhancing water column stability and elevating temperatures. These findings reveal a paradoxical post-storm vulnerability window that facilitates bloom formation in climate-sensitive reservoirs. Given projected intensification of rainfall extremes under climate change, this study highlights the urgent need for integrated management strategies combining watershed nutrient control, meteorological forecasting, and adaptive reservoir operation to mitigate cyanobacterial harmful algal bloom risks.

Improved spatial representation of precipitation and air surface temperature over highlands of the southern tropical Andes (Lake Titicaca region) during an austral summer using the WRF model	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												Due to its complex topography, the Lake Titicaca region, located in the southern tropical Andes, presents great challenges for atmospheric modeling. This study aims to improve the representation of precipitation and air surface temperature using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at high spatial resolution (2 km), during the austral summer of 2020. We conducted 11 experiments with different configurations of topography, land use, physical parameterizations, and lake surface temperature (LST). Each experiment was evaluated considering in-situ data from the Peruvian-Bolivian region and gridded precipitation products. For precipitation, the best configuration, with an average bias close to zero mm, includes using the GMTED2010 topography (not smoothed) and the land use data of Eva et al. (2004), along with the Purdue Lin microphysics and the Grell 3D cumulus scheme. For air temperature, the best configuration, which showed an average underestimation between 0 and - 0.5 degrees C, included the same topography and land use, along with the parameterization of the SENAMHI Operational Model (SOM), including the WRF Single Moment 3 microphysics and the Kain-Fritsch cumulus scheme. In the last experiment, the sea surface temperature (SST) was updated, resulting in an average LST increase of +1.8 degrees C over Lake Titicaca. This resulted in an increase in the precipitation bias (82.2 %) due to increased evaporation and convection over the lake and decreased southwestward moisture transport. These results highlight the sensitivity of the WRF model to parameterization choices and SST forcing data, emphasizing the importance of any changes in these variables.

Given the socioeconomic importance of these lakes, water quality should be maintained at high levels for such intensive recreational purposes. In 2002 studies of species composition, biomass, and toxin production by phytoplankton and the attendant physicochemical variables were performed in order to assess the risk of cyanobacterial blooms in selected northern lakes: Lakes Jeziorak, Jagodne, Szymoneckie, Szymon, Taltowisko, Siecino, and Trzesiecko. The research showed that total phosphorus (0.1 mg P/L) and total nitrogen (1.5 mg N/L) in the studied lakes almost exceeded the permissible limits for eutrophication of water bodies. Most phytoplankton samples were taken in late summer, when cyanobacteria were expected to reach their highest biomass. At the time of sampling most of the lakes were dominated by oscillatorialean and nostocalean species. Average chlorophyll-a concentration was higher than 10 mu g/L in almost all the lakes studied, which corresponded with an average microcystin concentration in the range of 4-5 mu g/L. The main microcystins in the analyzed samples were dmMC-RR, MC-RR, MC-YR, and MC-LR. The results demonstrated a potential for intensive cyanobacterial blooms to appear during the summer in northern Polish lakes. The levels of cyanobacteria found in the lakes investigated indicated that toxicity had reached the first-alert level according to World Health Organization recommendations. If microcystin-producing cyanobacteria dominate, with a microcystin concentration of 2-4 mu g/L, symptoms of toxicity can appear in the swimmers most sensitive to exposure. Analysis of cyanobacterial assemblages in northern Polish lakes also indicated a significant presence of Aphanizomenon species including a Scandinavian species, A. skujae (Skuja) Kom.-Legn. & Cronb. Future investigations of Polish lakes also should assess neurotoxins and study the biology of their producers. This study was the first attempt to evaluate the potential danger of toxic cyanobacterial blooms in the lakes of northern Poland. (C) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Addition of sulfate resulted in partial but immediately inhibition of H2-dependent methanogenesis. Sulfate addition did not result in an immediate decrease in the steady state condition of dissolved H2, nor did it significantly stimulate the rate constant of H2 turnover. Sulfate-induced decreaase in dissolved H2 was only observed after prolonged incubation or when endogenous H2 production was stimulated by added glucose. The turnover of the in situ H2 acccounted for only 14% of the H2-dependent methanogenesis from bicarbonate. While rates of methanogenesis increased during the season, rates of H2 turnover decreased, accounting for only 2% of the H2-dependent metathogenesis at the end of summer stratification. These observations indicate that increasing protons of CH4 were formed from H2 being directly transferred in syntrophic methanogenesis associations. The rapid inhibition of H2-dependent methanogenesis by exogenous sulfate may be explained at least partially by assuming methanogenic associations in which syntrophic sulfate reductase change their metabolism from fermentative H2 production to sulfate reduction.																			0168-6496	1574-6941				APR	1987	45	2					107	115		10.1111/j.1574-6968.1987.tb02346.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.1987.tb02346.x													WOS:A1987H544200008

Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers in Arctic lake sediments: Sources and implications for paleothermometry at high latitudes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) are analyzed in different lakes of the Mackenzie (Canadian Arctic) and Kolyma (Siberian Arctic) River basins to evaluate their sources and the implications for brGDGT-based paleothermometry in high-latitude lakes. The comparison of brGDGT distributions and concentrations in the lakes with those in river suspended particulate matter, riverbank sediments, and permafrost material indicates that brGDGTs in Arctic lake sediments have mixed sources. In contrast to global observations, distributional offsets between brGDGTs in Arctic lakes and elsewhere in the catchment are minor, likely due to the extreme seasonality and short window of biological production at high latitudes. Consequently, both soil- and lake-calibrated brGDGT-based temperature proxies return sensible temperature estimates, even though the mean air temperature (MAT) in the Arctic is below the calibration range. The original soil-calibrated MBT-CBT (methylation of branched tetraethers-cyclisation of branched tetraethers) proxy generates MATs similar to those in the studied river basins, whereas using the recently revised MBT-CBT calibration overestimates MAT. The application of the two global lake calibrations, generating summer air temperatures (SAT) and MAT, respectively, illustrates the influence of seasonality on the production of brGDGTs in lakes, as the latter overestimates actual MAT, whereas the SAT-based lake calibration accounts for this influence and consequently returns more accurate temperatures. Our results in principle support the application of brGDGT-based temperature proxies in high-latitude lakes in order to obtain long-term paleotemperature records for the Arctic, although the calibration and associated transfer function have to be selected with care.

The heavy metal concentrations were investigated monthly except winter months. The lowest and the highest accumulation levels were observed in April and in August, respectively. The soils were also evaluated according to zonation around the lake and the relations between the four selected stations. There is a correlation between the heavy metals and their sources. There should be some precautions taken against the heavy metal pollution around Salt Lake because of the ecological, agricultural and economical importance of the area.

Seasonal sampling was conducted in the Hartbeespoort Lake using sub-surface grab sampling to determine the lake's ecological status and obtain data for establishment of progressive operational monitoring. The Jukskei River, which lies upstream of the Hartbeespoort Dam, was sampled in the winter season. Five year old carp Cyprinus carpio) and catfish Clarias gariepinus) were also sampled from the Hartbeespoort Dam to study bioaccumulation in biota as well as to estimate risk associated with fish consumption. In the Jukskei River, the main source of 11 emerging pollutants EPs) was identified as raw sewage overflow, with the highest Sigma 11 EP concentration of 593 ng L-1 being recorded at the Midrand point and the lowest Sigma 11 EP concentration of 164 ng L-1 at the N14 site located 1 km downstream of a large wastewater treatment plant. The Jukskei River was found to be the largest contributor of the emerging contaminants detected in the Hartbeespoort Dam. In the Hartbeespoort Dam EP concentrations were generally in the order efavirenz > nevirapine > carbamazepine > methocarbamol > bromacil > venlafaxine. Water and sediment were sampled from the uMngeni River estuary within 24 h after large volumes of an assortment of pharmaceuticalwaste had been discovered to bewashed into the river estuary after flash rainfall on 18 May 2016. Analytical results revealed high levels of some emerging pollutants in sediment samples, up to 81 ng g(-1) for nevirapine and 4 ng g(-1) for etilefrine HCL. This study shows that efavirenz, nevirapine, carbamazepine, methocarbamol, bromacil and venlafaxine are contaminants that require operational monitoring in South African urban waters.

J	Pekey, B; Karakas, D; Ayberk, S				Pekey, Beyhan; Karakas, Duran; Ayberk, Savas			Atmospheric deposition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to Izmit Bay, Turkey	CHEMOSPHERE												Wet deposition and dry deposition samples were collected in an urban/industrialized area of lzmit Bay, North-eastern Marmara Sea, Turkey, from September 2002 to July 2003. The samples were analyzed for sixteen polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds by using HPLC-UV technique. Wet and dry deposition concentrations and fluxes of PAHs were determined. The results showed that PAH concentrations were high because of industrial processes, heavy traffic and residential areas next to the sampling site. Total dry deposition flux of the fifteen 3-6 ring PAHs was 8.30 mu g m(-2) day(-1), with a range of 0.034-1.77 mu g m(-2) day(-1). The total wet deposition flux of the fifteen 3-6 ring PAHs was 1716 mu g m(-2) 11 month(-1), with a range of 10-440 mu g m(-2) 11 month(-1). Significant seasonal differences were observed in both types of deposition samples. The winter fluxes of total PAHs were 1.5 and 2.5 times greater than those of the warm period for wet and dry deposition samples, respectively. Factor analysis of dry deposition samples and back trajectory analysis of wet deposition samples were also used to characterize and identify the PAH emission sources in this study.

The charr population of Vangsvatnet consists of 1 pale phenotype with parr marks along the flanks and poorly developed spawning coloration (dwarf charr) and another phenotype with silvery flanks in nonbreeding condition and bright red spawning colors (normal charr). The habitus of the 2 morphs indicated that they were adapted to different niches during the growth season. The analyses of distribution and food showed that there was marked habitat and food segregation between the 2 morphs during summer, when dwarf charr dwelled in the deep-benthic and normal charr roamed in the limnetic zone. The segregation broke down in periods of food abundance, indicating that the habitat segregation was due to intraspecific competition for food. A comparison of charr morphs of Vangsvatnet with the nearby Lonavatnet Lake suggested that the number of charr morphs is adapted to local environmental conditions, among which lake morphology, food availability and other fish species are important. The number of charr morphs within a locality depends on the number of available niches during the growth season.

Although wetland areas in these drylands have experienced dramatic, unidirectional shifts in their ecological status in recent centuries, fundamental driving forces are poorly quantified. Here, we examine changes in sedimentary proxies (diatoms, spectrally-inferred chlorophyll-a, stable isotopes) preserved in a radiometrically-dated core from Tianchi Lake, an alpine lake within the margin of the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) limit in China's southwestern Loess Plateau. Our algal trends were compared with regional instrumental records, changes in EASM intensity, and with previously published paleolimnological data from this same lake to determine the principal drivers of regional ecological changes. We found no clear evidence that geochemical and biological proxies were strongly affected by deforestation and other human activities. Major environmental changes during the past similar to 200 years were found to be predominantly driven by climatic fluctuations, extreme precipitation events, and changes in EASM intensity. Prior to similar to 1965 CE, diatom assemblages indicate an oligotrophic, clear water state. Shifts in dominance between benthic Staurosirella pinnata and planktonic Lindavia comensis were likely controlled by ice-cover dynamics. Between similar to 1965 and 1980 CE an abrupt shift to a turbid water state during a period of extreme precipitation events was caused by excessive nutrient-laden soil erosion in the already susceptible deforested catchment. This turbid period was evidenced by a rapid increase to dominance of Achnanthidium minutissimum, a sharp decline in oligotrophic Lindavia comensis, increased primary production, and peaks in sediment grain size and SiO2 content. Post- similar to 1980 CE, we provide evidence that a shift towards planktonic diatom dominance can best be explained by changes in climate and EASM intensity, despite substantial nitrogen deposition in the region during the past few decades. Specifically, a drier and warmer climate together with weakened EASM wind strength resulted in decreased erosion and a return to a clear water state, coupled with enhanced thermal stability. Collectively, these observations expand our understanding of how changes in climate, extreme precipitation events, and fluctuations in EASM intensity influence semi-arid alpine lakes in northern China, as well as climate's leading role in driving ecological change over the past two centuries, despite the intensification of human disturbances during recent decades.

During the study, six expeditions were carried out in the Summers of 2005-2007. All lakes are located at altitudes between 2530 and 3370 m except Uzungol (1100 m). Beside the biological samplings, major environmental variables of the lakes were measured. A total of 21 Branchiopoda, 9 Maxillopoda and 3 Ostracod taxa were identified. All the taxa identified are new records for their. localities except C. ponticus. The investigated ecosystems support a high micro-crustacean diversity that must be adequately preserved due to the increasing direct and indirect impacts on high mountain lakes.

Italy)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We studied the phytoplankton assemblage of the western basin of Lake Como (Northern Italy) during 1997. The phytoplankton assemblage was composed of 65 taxa, belonging to six taxonomic groups. Chlorophyta were represented by the highest number of taxa (28) followed by Bacillariophyceae (17), Cyanoprokaryota (9), Dinophyceae (6), Chrysophyceae (3) and Cryptophyta (2). The total assemblage density and biomass ranged from 902 ind ml(-)1 and 134.5 mm(3) m(-3) in February to 58 766 ind ml(-) (1) and 9360 mm(3) m(-3) in October. The density and biomass variation at three stations showed a common pattern, with higher values in the southern part of the basin where TP concentrations were always greater. The phytoplankton succession was analysed by cluster analysis (average linkage clustering) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination, both applied to a dissimilarity matrix obtained from a calculation of the Bray-Curtis index. In general, the seasonal succession followed a simple pattern, with a clear spring phase. These results are discussed considering the trophic evolution of the lake and its recent colonization by Dreissena polymorpha.

In the last decade, the lake has experienced an early-occurring and prolonged dry season that has deteriorated the lake's ecological status. To tackle this issue, the Chinese government has proposed the construction of the Poyang Lake Hydraulic Project (PLHP) to regulate water flow to the lake. However, its impact on migratory bird habitats is unknown. In this study, we simulated the habitat suitability for migratory birds in Poyang Lake during wet and dry years, with and without the presence/operation of the hydraulic project. A two-dimensional hydrodynamic model was used to simulate the water conditions for each case. Matter-element theory, 3S technology and ecological knowledge were combined to develop a matter-element-based habitat suitability model in a geographic information system (GIS)-based platform. We assessed and compared the habitat suitability in four scenarios: (1) Wet year without the hydraulic project, (2) wet year with the hydraulic project, (3) dry year without the hydraulic project, and (4) dry year with the hydraulic project. The results showed that the operation of the hydraulic project can effectively alleviate the water shortage issue in the wetland and increase the area of habitats suitable for migratory birds in typical dry years. However, it can reduce the area of suitable habitats in the northern provincial nature reserve of the lake. In addition, a reasonable management of the lake's fishing activities can also increase habitat suitability and promote balanced patterns between human activities and migratory bird habitats.

The aims of the work have been to present results on the linkage between the concentration of Cs-137 in fish, lake load of Cs and lake characteristics, to give a preliminary prognosis on the recovery, and to put the results within a wider framework of environmental hazard analysis. A broad set of of data on limnology, morphometry and drainage area conditions from 41 lakes were collected during 1986 and 1987. Cs-137 was determined in 1 + perch (Cs-pe, 1-year-old perch), water, material collected by sediment traps and from surficial sediments. The main results are as follows. The average value of Cs-pe for all lakes has dropped from 9800 Bq kg-1 (wet) to 5040 between the 2 years. Generally, the decrease is between 5 and 90%. We have tested if any factor(s) could be specifically linked to this decrease-no such factors have been found. The concentrations of Cs in sediment traps have, on average, decreased by 80%. Very high correlations exist between Cs-pe and the caesium load as determined from the sediment traps. Between 1 and 10% (mean 3 .cntdot. 9%) of the initial fall-out deposition to the drainage area was transported from land to water during June to August 1986. The variation in initial fall-out deposition explains 65-69% of the variability in Cs-pe; the degree of explanation (= coefficient of determination, r2) increases to about 85% if one also takes into account the lake water hardness and totP. A map showing areas with lakes likely to have 1 + perch with higher mean Cs-concentrations than 1500 Bq kg-1 wet is presented. Between 4000 and 7000 lakes in Sweden appear to have Cs-pe higher than 1500 Bq kg-1 wet, figures which emphasize the serious impact of the Chernobyl accident on the environmental conditions in Sweden.																			0269-7491	1873-6424					1989	58	2-3					195	212		10.1016/0269-7491(89)90064-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0269-7491(89)90064-X								15092431					WOS:A1989AC59300009

For this purpose, we created a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series extending from 2017 to 2021. Data were collected and fitted to a unimodal growth model, from which we determined three different stages relating to the reed's growth. The field data consisted of the above-ground biomass harvested at the end of the vegetation season. Maximal NDVI values at the peak of the growing season exhibited no useful relationship with the above-ground biomass at the end of the season. Intense and long-lasting floods, especially during the period of intense culm growth, hindered the production of common reeds, while dry periods and temperatures were helpful before reed growth began. Summer droughts exhibited little effect. Water level fluctuations exerted a greater effect on reeds at the littoral site due to more pronounced extremes. In contrast, more constant and moderate conditions at the riparian site benefited the growth and productivity of the common reed. These results can prove useful for decision making regarding common reed management at the intermittent lake Cerknica.

'In summer we go and drink at the lake': young men and the geographies of alcohol and drinking in rural Estonia	CHILDRENS GEOGRAPHIES												In this paper, we explore the role of place in drinking practices of young people in the context of rural Estonia. We draw on a participatory research project carried out during seven months with a group of eight young men (15-18 years of age). We focus on three locations identified as the most popular drinking places by the young men in our research - familial homes, a local hamburger kiosk and the outdoors. The findings indicate that youth drinking practices as well as the drunkenness-related risks are spatially contingent. Characteristics of individual drinking locations influence the negotiation of local and national opportunities, restrictions and attitudes toward drinking, and the associated risks. We argue that, when developing public health tools, it is fruitful to pay attention to the local context and specific places in which young people's drinking practices are negotiated.					van Hoven, Bettina/KOZ-9470-2024	van Hoven, Bettina/0000-0002-6800-8602; Trell, Elen-Maarja/0000-0003-4419-6474													1473-3285	1473-3277					2014	12	4					447	463		10.1080/14733285.2013.824740	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14733285.2013.824740													WOS:000342284400005

A water and energy budget model was used to simulate climatic scenarios that would have resulted in the observed changes in the water levels, water surfaces, water volumes and salinity during that time interval. Different climatic scenarios for the Laguna Lejia catchment include precipitation increases of over 100% up to 400- > 500 mm/yr (today 200 mm/yr) to account for the late-glacial lake levels with shorelines 15-25 m higher than at present, and a lake surface of 9-11 km2 compared to the present 2 km2. During the lake maximum about 13,500-11,300 yr B.P. finely laminated sediments consisting of Mg-calcite, diatoms and sometimes gypsum were deposited. The paleoenvironmental evidence indicates that (north)easterly wind direction prevailed, and the summer rainfall resulted from a seasonal poleward shift of the tropical circulation. The lake history of Laguna Lejia is representative for the Altiplano area between 21-degrees and 24-degrees-S.																			0031-0182					MAY	1994	109	1					89	100		10.1016/0031-0182(94)90119-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(94)90119-8													WOS:A1994NX25600003
J	Vickery, RK				Vickery, RK			Remarkable waxing, waning, and wandering of populations of Mimulus guttatus:: An unexpected example of global warming	GREAT BASIN NATURALIST												The purpose of this study was to observe the dynamics of a meta-population of Mimulus guttatus. Changes in size and location of 16 original populations and the new populations established in their vicinities in Big Cottonwood Canyon, Salt Lake County, Utah, were observed for 25 yr. Twenty-three new populations appeared. Seven original populations and 13 new populations had become extinct by the end of the observation period in 1996. Many populations died out and were reestablished, often repeatedly, during the observation period. Altogether there were 54 population disappearances and 34 reappearances. Many populations changed size as much as 100-fold or more from year to year. There were spectacular examples of populations expanding to fill newly available, large habitats. Frequent extinctions were due overwhelmingly to the canyon drying trend, which led to the drying up of most Mill D North drainage springs, creeks, and ponds. Precipitation and minimum temperatures increased moderately during the observation period. The growing season lengthened almost 50%, a typical consequence of global warming. The drying trend, lengthened growing season; and disappearance of Mimulus populations in Big Cottonwood Canyon appear to be a clear, local example of global warming.																			0017-3614					APR	1999	59	2					112	126																WOS:000080390000002

A comparison of the LEACHW module with the field data reveals some discrepancies, due to the tendency of this model to overestimate the hysteretic processes in the examined soil. Also a coupled thermal and infiltration model was developed, assuring computational stability even in the presence of the discontinuities of meteo-climatic forcings, which is capable of applications during long term simulations. The results produced appear to deal with the large variability of observed values of the matric potential, particularly during the winter season, when there is reduced root activity. The results obtained enabled us to underline the influence of the vegetation cover on the water hydrodynamics throughout the soil. Both models proved to be very sensitive to the variability of the spatial distribution of the root system.																					3-923381-48-4				2002	35						563	572																WOS:000178403800055

Seasonal flooding broke out in July 2020 in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, resulting in continued high water levels in lakes connected to the Yangtze River. To study the impact of extreme flooding on aquatic vegetation cover, we utilized two methods (surveying and remote sensing image data) to determine the changes in the aquatic vegetation cover of Shengjin Lake, one of the lakes connected to the Yangtze River, during the wet season from 2018 to 2020. The results showed that the dominant aquatic plant species before the flood in July 2020 were the emergent plant Zizania caduciflora, the floating plant Trapa incisa, the submerged plant Ceratophyllum demersum and Vallisineria natans. The area covered by aquatic vegetation in 2018-2019 showed a slight upward trend, increasing from 24.94 to 25.94 km(2). In April 2020, the aquatic vegetation cover was 25.53 km(2), and after the flooding in July 2020, the aquatic vegetation cover decreased sharply to 1.36 km(2), which was mainly composed of emergent plant Z. caduciflora in the nearshore. No recovery of the dominant aquatic plant species, the floating plant T. incisa and other submerged plants, was seen during the monitoring of water level decline from September to December 2020. Winter wetland plants were not significantly affected by flooding. The results of the study provide a theoretical basis for the maintenance mechanism of aquatic vegetation and lake management in Shengjin Lake.

TROPHIC SEGREGATION IN MULTISPECIES COMMUNITY OF SALMONIDS IN THE PENZHINA RIVER LOWER COURSE (KAMCHATSKY KRAI, RUSSIA)	NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH												Trophic relationships are presented for the juveniles of Coregonus sardinella, C. subautumnalis, C. pidschian, Prosopium cylindraceum, and Thymallus arcticus mertensii jointly inhabiting the Penzhina River lower reaches in summer. This community has no analogues in the North-Okhotsk region in terms of freshwater salmonid diversity. We analysed the stomachs content, indicative parasites infestation and stable isotopes ratio in the muscles. We demonstrated the similarity of food niches for the following pairs of species P. cylindraceum - T. a. mertensii and C. sardinella - C. subautumnalis. The summer diet of the species pair P. cylindraceum - T. a. mertensii mainly consisted of chironomid larvae. At the same time, mysids dominated in the diet of the species pair C. sardinella - C. subautumnalis. Coregonus pidschian mainly fed on gammarids. The following parasites have been found in juvenile fishes: Chloromyxum tuberculatum, Myxobolus sp., Proteocephalus longicollis, Triaenophorus nodulosus, Diplostomum sp., Metecercaria spp., Pronoprymna petrowi, Cystidicola farionis, Salmonema ephemeridarum, Raphidascaris acus, Pseudocapillaria salvelini, Echinorhynchus cotti, and Salmincola extensus; herewith, the intensity of invasion was low for all parasites. Only T. a. mertensii has been infested by C. tuberculatum, T. nodulosus, and C. farionis. Only C. pidschian was infested by P. longicollis. Only C. sardinella and C. subautumnalis have been infested by P. petrowi, while Salmincola extensus has infested only P. cylindraceum in the studied ecosystem. Thymallus arcticus mertensii and C. pidschian are significantly different from other fish species in term of infestation by the helminths E. cotti and P. salvelini. In the delta C-13-N-15 isotopes space, the fish juveniles formed three groups: 1) with high N-15 level (C. sardinella - C. subautumnalis), 2) with low C-13 level (C. pidschian), and 3) with low N-15 - high C-13 level (P. cylindraceum - T. a. mertensii). The complexity of trophic relationships of juvenile salmonids in the River Penzhina and an increased feeding competition in the species pairs threaten the functioning of the unique River Penzhina salmonid community under the conditions of extreme fishing pressure in the Northern Far East.

The diatom was recorded at the Macun plateau, Swiss National Park, from samples of terrestrial and wet semi-terrestrial mosses near the stream splash zone. The diatom has a unique set of features and is easily recognized under light and scanning electron microscopy. The most distinctive feature is the presence of a prominent silica collar in a 'rose flower' shape rounding each carinoportulae and an additional silica collar on the areolae (first 3-4 rows) bordering the hyaline area. The valve diameter of O. helvetica sp. nov. is 7.5-26.5 & mu;m and possesses 2-3 (usually 3) carinoportulae. Linking spines at the valve face/mantle junction are present, having a simple basis and being triangular in shape.

To feed or flee: early life-history behavioural strategies of juvenile lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) during risk-sensitive foraging	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Balancing foraging opportunities with predation risk can promote complex behavioural strategies in juvenile fishes, particularly in northern temperate environments with short growing seasons. To test how predation experience may influence foraging effort and risk assessment of juvenile lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque, 1817), flight response and substrate preference behavioural measurements were taken during critical life periods of early exogenous feeding (similar to 60 days post fertilization (dpf)) and pre-winter (similar to 160 dpf). Lake sturgeon were placed in arenas with partial cover and exposed white plastic bottom. Chemical alarm cue (AC) was introduced to predator naive individuals in the presence or absence of food over the exposed portion of the arena to simulate risk sensitive foraging over diurnal and seasonal periods. The same protocol was run on predator-experienced individuals, which were classically conditioned to predator cue (PC) prior to the trials. Whole-body cortisol measures were also taken to determine the physiological response to predation experience. Results suggest a propensity to forage in spite of predation risk during the naive similar to 60 dpf trials and highlight context-specific anti-predator responses of naive and experienced lake sturgeon. Elevated basal whole-body cortisol levels and reduced body condition (p < 0.05) were observed with increased predator experience.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				AUG	2020	98	8					541	550		10.1139/cjz-2019-0181	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2019-0181													WOS:000557787800005

However, most of this carbon is in a potential labile state, and expected changes in temperature and water availability could strongly affect the carbon balance of tundra ecosystems. Plant community composition and soil carbon are closely tied to microtopography and position relative to the water table. We evaluated CO2 fluxes and moss contribution to ecosystem photosynthesis in response to fine-scale topography across a drained lake bed in Barrow, Alaska, during two contrasting growing seasons. CO2 exchange was assessed through static chamber measurements in three vegetation classes distinguished by plant dominance and topographic position within low-centered polygons. Gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) were the lowest under high soil moisture conditions in 2006. ER responded more strongly to wet conditions, resulting in a larger summer sink in 2006 than in 2005 (64 vs. 17g CO2 m(-2), respectively). Microsites responded differently to contrasting weather conditions. Low elevation microsites presented a strong reduction in ER as a result of increased water availability. A maximum of 48% of daytime GPP and 33% of seasonal daytime GPP was contributed by moss on average across microtopographic positions. The interaction between fine-scale microtopography and variation in temperature and water availability can result in considerable differences in CO2 sink activity of the polygonal tundra.

Ail of these chemicals may derive from the former phenol manufacturing activities present at the Industri-Plex site during World War I. Concentrations up to 1660 mu g/l benzene, 450 mu g/l DPS, 230 mu g/l PPP, and 100 mu g/l OPP were detected in the hypolimnion. Epilimnetic concentrations of the chemicals were significantly lower (normally <5 mu g/l). DPS showed a distinct seasonal behavior: it was readily biodegradable during warm periods. No biodegradation was observed in the winter, leaving export to the Aberjona River as the major removal mechanism. Although benzene is known to be toxic and a human carcinogen, our results indicate that DPS, OPP, and PPP are not mutagenic in tests using human MCL-5 and h1A1v2 cell lines.					; Wick, Lukas/AAH-3221-2020	Wick, Lukas Y/0000-0001-7296-865X; 													0091-6765					AUG	1998	106			4			1069	1074											9703495					WOS:000075403900022

During the past decade, the persistent dryness of Poyang Lake (the largest freshwater lake in China) has caused water supply and irrigation crises for the 12.4 million inhabitants of the region. There is conjecture as to whether this dryness is caused by climate variability and/or human activities. This study examines long-term datasets of catchment inflow and Lake outflow, and employs a physically-based hydrodynamic model to explore catchment and Yangtze River controls on the Lake's hydrology. Lake water levels fell to their lowest during 2001-2010 relative to previous decades. The average Lake size and volume reduced by 154 km(2) and 11 x 10(8) m(3) during the same period, compared to those for the preceding period (1970-2000). Model simulations demonstrated that the drainage effect of the Yangtze River was the primary causal factor. Modeling also revealed that, compared to climate variability impacts on the Lake catchment, modifications to Yangtze River flows from the Three Gorges Dam have had a much greater impact on the seasonal (September-October) dryness of the Lake. Yangtze River effects are attenuated in the Lake with distance from the River, but nonetheless propagate some 100 km to the lake's upstream limit. Proposals to build additional dams in the upper Yangtze River and its tributaries are expected to impose significant challenges for the management of Poyang Lake. Hydraulic engineering to modify the flow regime between the Lake and the Yangtze River would somewhat resolve the seasonal dryness of the Lake, but will likely introduce other issues in terms of water quality and aquatic ecosystem health, requiring considerable further research.

However, this wetland has always been subject to several risks, such as pollution, that threaten its terrestrial and aquatic biota. The water quality of the lake is classified as class 4 (highly polluted) according to Algerian standards. However, until now, there has been no study analysing the macroinvertebrate fauna of this important site. Therefore, in order to characterize the state of this wetland of international importance, which is highly affected by intense physical and chemical pollution of agricultural and anthropogenic origin, we studied its water quality (physical and chemical parameters) and its biological communities for one year to consider possible seasonal trends. According to our results, seasonal changes in the concentrations of physical and chemical elements were found, summer being the season with the highest level of nutrients and other pollutants concentration in the water. Although we observed these different environmental conditions throughout the year, we did not find evident differences in the communities of macroinvertebrates that showed small changes in composition and structure throughout the year.

Streamflow and Nutrients from a Karst Watershed with a Downstream Embayment: Chapel Branch Creek	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												Understanding sources of streamflow and nutrient concentrations are fundamental for the assessment of pollutant loadings that can lead to water quality impairments. The objective of this study was to evaluate the discharge of three main tributaries, draining different land uses with karst features, as well as their combined influences on total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) levels in reservoir-like embayment (R-E) on a stream entering Lake Marion, South Carolina. From 2007-2009, hydrology, TN, and TP data were collected from the 1,555-ha Chapel Branch Creek (CBC) watershed. In general, monthly streamflow in all tributaries was found to be -10% of rainfall, and as little as 0.1% in the smallest tributary. The third tributary flowed into a cave system and discharged via a cave spring (CS) into the embayment while gaining a sustained groundwater flow from a second cave (GW) system. The CS flow was substantially larger than the flow measured in the other tributaries. The small amount of rainfall that became surface flow and the large flow at the cave spring indicated a significant water loss from the surface watershed to subsurface flow or a groundwater source area substantially larger than the surface watershed. Nutrient concentrations in flows from tributaries draining various land uses were not significantly different (alpha=0.05) for most of the locations. A simple water balance was developed to estimate the R-E outflow to Lake Marion using measured discharges from three tributaries, change in storage computed using a bathymetric survey, daily lake level changes, rainfall, and computed evaporation. Mean monthly TN and TP concentrations in the embayment were substantially lower than the observed means from the two tributary outlets and the CS into the embayment, indicating a loss in the embayment. The second cave system at CS, representing an unknown subsurface drainage area, was the source of nearly 50% of TP loading, over 50% of flow, and over 70% of TN loading to CBC. These results may have implications in water quality management of the CBC watershed.																			1084-0699	1943-5584				FEB 1	2014	19	2					428	438		10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0000794	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0000794													WOS:000335149700009

Diet Overlap of Top-Level Predators in Recent Sympatry: Bull Trout and Nonnative Lake Trout	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The establishment of nonnative lake trout Salvelinus namaycush in lakes containing lacustrine-adfluvial bull trout Salvelinus confluentus often results in a precipitous decline in bull trout abundance. The exact mechanism for the decline is unknown, but one hypothesis is related to competitive exclusion for prey resources. We had the rare opportunity to study the diets of bull trout and nonnative lake trout in Swan Lake, Montana during a concomitant study. The presence of nonnative lake trout in Swan Lake is relatively recent and the population is experiencing rapid population growth. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diets of bull trout and lake trout during the early expansion of this nonnative predator. Diets were sampled from 142 bull trout and 327 lake trout during the autumn in 2007 and 2008. Bull trout and lake trout had similar diets, both consumed Mysis diluviana as the primary invertebrate, especially at juvenile stages, and kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka as the primary vertebrate prey, as adults. A diet shift from primarily M. diluviana to fish occurred at similar lengths for both species, 506 mm (476-545 mm, 95% CI) for bull trout and 495 mm (470-518 mm CI) for lake trout. These data indicate high diet overlap between these two morphologically similar top-level predators. Competitive exclusion may be a possible mechanism if the observed overlap remains similar at varying prey densities and availability.																			1944-687X					DEC	2011	2	2					183	189		10.3996/012011-JFWM-004	http://dx.doi.org/10.3996/012011-JFWM-004													WOS:000311625500007

Continuous Dynamics of Dissolved Methane Over 2 Years and its Carbon Isotopes (δ13C, Δ14C) in a Small Arctic Lake in the Mackenzie Delta	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Seasonally ice-covered permafrost lakes in the Arctic emit methane to the atmosphere during periods of open-water. However, processes contributing to methane cycling under-ice have not been thoroughly addressed despite the potential for significant methane emission to the atmosphere at ice-out. We studied annual dissolved methane dynamics within a small (0.2 ha) Mackenzie River Delta lake using sensor and water sampling packages that autonomously and continuously collected lake water samples, respectively, for two years at multiple water column depths. Lake physical and biogeochemical properties (temperature; light; concentrations of dissolved oxygen, manganese, iron, and dissolved methane, including stable carbon, and radiocarbon isotopes) revealed annual patterns. Dissolved methane concentrations increase under-ice after electron acceptors (oxygen, manganese, and iron oxides) are depleted or inaccessible from the water column. The radiocarbon age of dissolved methane suggests a source from recently decomposed carbon as opposed to thawed ancient permafrost. Sources of dissolved methane under-ice include a diffusive flux from the sediments and may include water column methanogenesis and/or under-ice hydrodynamic controls. Following ice-out, the water column only partially mixes allowing half of the winter-derived dissolved methane to be microbially oxidized. Despite oxidation at depth, surface water was a source of methane to the atmosphere. The greatest diffusive fluxes to the atmosphere occurred following ice-out (75 mmol CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) and during a mixing episode in mid-July, likely driven by a storm event. This study demonstrates the importance of fine-scale temporal sampling to understand dissolved methane processes in seasonally ice-covered lakes.					; Lapham, Laura/AAD-7655-2022; Orcutt, Beth/A-4051-2011	McIntosh Marcek, Hadley/0000-0003-3837-1299; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				MAR	2021	126	3							e2020JG006038	10.1029/2020JG006038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JG006038													WOS:000636286700016

J	Wang, XF; Veizer, J				Wang, XF; Veizer, J			Respiration-photosynthesis balance of terrestrial aquatic ecosystems, Ottawa area, Canada	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Rivers link terrestrial and marine biospheres by transporting carbon from land to ocean and by exchanging CO2 with the atmosphere. In an attempt to quantify the aquatic carbon cycle, we developed a technique based on carbon isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon (delta C-13(DIC)) and oxygen isotopic composition of dissolved oxygen (delta O-18(DO)). The approach was tested on selected boreal ecosystems in the Ottawa area, Canada: Meech Lake; the Ottawa River; and Green Creek, the latter dewatering the Mer Bleue bog. The three ecosystems were monitored for 1 yr and the calculated aquatic respiration/photosynthesis ratios in general fell within the 1 to 3.5 ranges. The ecosystems were respiration dominated year-round, despite increased photosynthetic rates during the warm season, a development that was apparently matched by a comparable enhancement in respiration rates. The year-round predominance of respiration over photosynthesis supports the results of earlier studies, showing that boreal aquatic ecosystems, particularly the lakes, are not solely dissipation pathways for soil-generated CO2 introduced into surficial water bodies by groundwater input. To fuel this year-round "excess" respiration, the steady state balance consideration demands that the ecosystem must have a continuous supply of allochthonous reduced carbon.

J	Nürnberg, GK				Nurnberg, Gertrud K.			Importance of considering internal phosphorus loading during climate change in predicting and managing cyanobacteria	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												N & uuml;rnberg GK. 2025. Importance of considering internal phosphorus loading during climate change in predicting and managing cyanobacteria. Lake Reserv Manage. XXX-XXX.Increased nutrient pollution often results in eutrophication including cyanobacteria proliferation. Climate change affects important lake characteristics, including water temperature, stratification, and hypoxia. While these and other climate change effects can lead to increases in cyanobacteria, they also support internal phosphorus (P) load. Internal load, which can be considered a legacy load from previous external P input, can be sufficient to sustain cyanobacteria even when external load decreases. Here, I explore what we gain by the inclusion of internal phosphorus (P) loading when describing and explaining the proliferation of cyanobacteria during climate change. A short primer on the phenomenon of internal P loading ensures understanding of this sometimes-elusive phenomenon. How changes in climate support internal P loading and affect cyanobacteria is then described. Changes include (1) increased summer water temperature and lake stability, (2) increased hypoxia due to changes in air temperature, lake stability, and open water duration, (3) decreased ice cover duration and extent, (4) drier conditions, and (5) atmospheric stilling and storm events. Consistent consideration of internal P load in lake assessment will lead to more effective management of lakes and reservoirs. That is achievable by adequate monitoring effort and the avoidance of at least 9 misconceptions regarding internal P loading and its influence on cyanobacteria. Misconceptions include that internal loading does not occur in oxygen-rich shallow mixed areas or in low-productivity lakes, that it does not affect summer epilimnia in stratified lakes, and that external is more important than internal P load despite internal load's much higher biological availability.					; Nurnberg, Gertrud/AFM-9725-2022	Nurnberg, Gertrud/0000-0003-1752-6562; 													1040-2381	2151-5530				JUL 3	2025	41	3					165	179		10.1080/10402381.2025.2538244	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2025.2538244		JUL 2025											WOS:001564196400001

Paleoclimatic implications of glacial and postglacial refugia for Pinus pumila in western Beringia	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Palynological results from Julietta Lake Currently provide the most direct evidence to support the existence of a glacial refugium for Pinus pumila in mountains of southwestern Beringia. Both percentages and accumulation rates indicate the evergreen shrub survived until at least similar to 19,000 C-14 yr BP in the Upper Kolyma region. Percentage data suggest numbers dwindled into the late glaciation, whereas pollen accumulation rates point towards a more rapid demise shortly after similar to 19,000 C-14 yr BP. Pinus pumila did not re-establish in any great numbers until similar to 81 00 C-14 yr BP, despite the local presence similar to 9800 C-14 yr BP of Larix dahurica, which shares similar Summer temperature requirements. The postglacial thermal maximum (in Beringia similar to 11,000-9000 C-14 yr BP) provided Pinus pumila shrubs with equally harsh albeit different conditions for survival than those present during the LGM. Regional records indicate that in this time of maximum Warmth Pinus pumila likely sheltered in a second, lower-elevation refugium. Paleoclimatic models and modern ecology suggest that shifts in the nature of seasonal transitions and not only seasonal extremes have played important roles in the history of Pinus pumila over the last similar to 21,000 C-14 yr BP.

The formation of biogeochemical laminations in Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana, and their usefulness as indicators of past environmental changes	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The sediments from Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana contain a unique record of fine-scale (mm to sub-mm) laminations, which will provide a valuable annual chronometer for reconstructing paleoenvironmental changes in West Africa covering much of the last 1 Ma. Comparisons of laminae counts to independent Pb-210 dates and the rise in anthropogenic "bomb" radiocarbon support the interpretation of the laminations in the uppermost sediments as registering annual events. Radiocarbon dates on in-situ fish-bone collagen are in agreement with varve counts, further supporting the annual nature of our varve chronology. Over the instrumental period (1925-1999), dark-varve thickness measurements are correlated with local rainfall (r = 0.54) and appear able to resolve decadal-scale changes in precipitation. The relationship between varve thickness and rainfall provides support for our interpretation that dark-colored varve thickness records catchment runoff during the rainy season rather than dust flux during the dry season. Dark laminae alternate with organic and carbonate-rich light laminae formed during the fall period of enhanced productivity. Downcore, varves undergo significant microstratigraphic and geochemical variations, but retain the same pattern of alternating clastic and organic-rich laminae, providing support that the laminae may represent annual time markers for reconstructions of the deeper part of the record.					; Shanahan, Timothy/B-1298-2012	Shanahan, Timothy/0000-0002-3831-3198; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				JUL	2008	40	1					339	355		10.1007/s10933-007-9164-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-007-9164-4													WOS:000257208600022

Minimum winter temperatures are demonstrated to have a major impact on O. mossambicus standing stock and hence on production. Comparisons are made between a number of limniological parameters in the lake and published tolerances of fish to these parameters. Deoxygenation and supersaturation of O2 and pH are approaching levels critical to fish survival. The growth of O. mossambicus in South Africa is related to soluble reactive P concentration and is sub-optimal in Hartbeespoort Dam, probably as a result of high P concentration.																			0377-9688						1984	10	1					11	15		10.1080/03779688.1984.9632873	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03779688.1984.9632873													WOS:A1984TV47500003

The dry weights displayed a seasonal pattern of increase to a maximum value in April, followed by a decrease in summer. No significant seasonal changes in ash content were apparent. When the dry weight is maximal, the relative carbon content is maximal and the relative nitrogen content is minimal. As a consequence, the C : N ratio is high then. This indicates that the annual dry weight cycle was caused by gain and loss of C. The literature on bivalves makes clear that the nutritional conditions for growth and reproduction, as well as the nature of the transfer of organic biomass for production and maturation of gametes are poorly understood. The timing of both depends on phytoplankton dynamics and latitude.					Kraak, Michiel/K-6928-2012														0003-9136					JUN	1993	127	4					409	421																WOS:A1993LQ08700003

Most studies on aufeis occurrence focus on regions in North America and Siberia, while research in High Mountain Asia (HMA) is still in an exploratory phase. This study investigates the extent and dynamics of icing processes and aufeis in the Tso Moriri basin, eastern Ladakh, India. Based on a combination of 235 Landsat 5 TM/8 OLI and Sentinel-2 imagery from 2008 to 2021 the occurrence of icing and aufeis was classified using a random forest classifier. A total of 27 frequently occurring aufeis fields with an average maximum extent of 9 km(2) were identified, located at a mean elevation of 4,700 m a.s.l. Temporal patterns show a distinct accumulation phase (icing) between November and April, and a melting phase lasting from May until July. Icing is characterized by high seasonal and inter-annual variability. Successive water overflow mainly occurs between January and March and seems to be related to diurnal freeze-thaw-cycles, whereas higher daytime temperatures result in larger icing areas. Aufeis feeding sources are often located within or in close vicinity to wetland areas, while vegetation is largely absent on surfaces with frequent aufeis formation. These interactions require more attention in future research. In addition, this study shows the high potential of a machine learning approach to monitor icing processes and aufeis, which can be transferred to other regions.

Methane Ebullition in Temperate Hydropower Reservoirs and Implications for US Policy on Greenhouse Gas Emissions	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The United States is home to 2198 dams actively used for hydropower production. With the December 2015 consensus adoption of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Paris Agreement, it is important to accurately quantify anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Methane ebullition, or methane bubbles originating from river or lake sediments, has been shown to account for nearly all methane emissions from tropical hydropower reservoirs to the atmosphere. However, distinct ebullitive methane fluxes have been studied in comparatively few temperate hydropower reservoirs globally. This study measures ebullitive and diffusive methane fluxes from two eastern Washington reservoirs, and synthesizes existing studies of methane ebullition in temperate, boreal, and tropical hydropower reservoirs. Ebullition comprises nearly all methane emissions (> 97%) from this study's two eastern Washington hydropower reservoirs to the atmosphere. Summer methane ebullition from these reservoirs was higher than ebullition in six southeastern U.S. hydropower reservoirs, however it was similar to temperate reservoirs in other parts of the world. Our literature synthesis suggests that methane ebullition from temperate hydropower reservoirs can be seasonally elevated compared to tropical climates, however annual emissions are likely to be higher within tropical climates, emphasizing the possible range of methane ebullition fluxes and the need for the further study of temperate reservoirs. Possible future changes to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and UNFCCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories highlights the need for accurate assessment of reservoir emissions.					; Richmond, Marshall/D-3915-2013	Goldman, Amy/0000-0003-0490-6451; Richmond, Marshall/0000-0003-0111-1485													0364-152X	1432-1009				OCT	2017	60	4					615	629		10.1007/s00267-017-0909-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-017-0909-1								28733708					WOS:000410806800005

From July 2007 to June 2008, we collected samples monthly from two sampling stations, using a 25-mu m mesh plankton net. The samples were preserved in 4% formaldehyde. We evaluated the following environmental variables related to the water in the lake: ammonia content, silica content, organic matter content, dissolved oxygen concentration, temperature, pH, depth, transparency, electrical conductivity and rainfall. To study the species composition in relation to environmental factors, we used cluster analysis, principal components analysis, canonical correspondence analysis and indicator species analysis. At the specific and infraspecific level, 22 taxa were identified, Trachelomonas elliptica (Playf.) Defl. and T. gracillima Bal. & Dast. representing new records for the state of Rio Grande do Sul.

Effects of light, temperature and habitat quality on meroplanktonic diatom rejuvenation in Lake Erie: implications for seasonal hypoxia	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Rapid sedimentation of phytoplankton cells following seasonal blooms is common in lakes and coastal zones throughout the world, yet the fate of these cells is uncertain. Ascertaining the fate of seasonal blooms may be particularly important in ecosystems that experience hypoxia. Benthic stations were sampled seasonally inside and outside of the hypoxic area in Lake Erie to test for differences in chlorophyll a concentrations, algal physiological condition (cell viability) and diatom rejuvenation rates (from enclosure experiments). Hypoxic areas did sustain higher chlorophyll a concentrations compared with oxic sites; however, diatom growth and physiological capability did not differ significantly. Hypoxic areas exhibited exponential growth rates as high as 0.56 day(-1) (compared with the oxic station at 0.53 day(-1), P = 0.000) and chlorophyll rejuvenation rates as high as 0.30 day(-1) (compared with the oxic station at 0.36 day(-1), P = 0.964). Therefore, sedimentation of phytoplankton cells may not only contribute to the seasonal hypoxia observed in Lake Erie, but those diatoms able to withstand low oxygen concentrations during the summer, once reintroduced into the water column, may also seed subsequent diatom blooms. Initial estimates indicate that the algal pigment present on the bottom of the central basin, likely sedimented from the overlying water, contributed significantly to hypolimnetic oxygen depletion (11-33%).

Almost one third of 300 investigated lakes had already lost their submerged macrophytes at that time. Very shallow lakes showed either high or low macrophyte abundance. Increasing depth resulted in medium macrophyte abundances, which may contribute to the stabilisation of local or temporary clearwater states. Forty years later, the percentage of lakes without macrophytes had dramatically increased. Between 55 and 85% of the investigated lakes showed a low abundance. The decline was most pronounced in very shallow lakes. The majority of the investigated lakes showed summer TP concentrations below 100 mug L-1, but no colonisation by submerged macrophytes, which indicates a resilience against re-colonisation.																			1434-2944						2002	87	4					375	384		10.1002/1522-2632(200207)87:4<375::AID-IROH375>3.0.CO;2-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1522-2632(200207)87:4<375::AID-IROH375>3.0.CO;2-7													WOS:000177277500003

MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Mangrove wetlands are vital coastal ecosystems that can absorb and accumulate pollutants. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are persistent organic pollutants that pose potential risks to ecosystems and human health. However, their source and transport fate in mangrove areas are poorly understood. This study investigates 29 PAHs pollution of water and sediment in Zhangjiangkou Mangrove Wetland, the northernmost large-scale mangrove wetland reserve in China. We examine the distribution, source, transport mechanisms and risk assessment of PAHs. The results show that the concentrations of PAHs in mangrove sediment range from 55.62 to 347.36 ng/g (DW), with 5 -ring PAHs being the dominant species. While the concentrations of PAHs in surface water range from 10.61 to 46.39 ng/L, with 2 -ring PAHs and alkylated PAHs being the dominant species. The PAHs concentrations in surface water and sediment of river are higher than those in mangrove area, indicating that mangrove water could receive PAHs through tidal exchange. Based on diagnostic ratios (DRs), principal component analysis (PCA), and positive matrix factorization (PMF), we infer that the leaf deposition (48.55%) could be an important pathway of PAHs in mangrove sediment except for river water transport (51.45%), while the PAHs in estuary water originate mainly from point sources such as biomass burning (50.96%) and traffic emission (49.04%). The range of toxic equivalents in surface water and sediment was 2.73-16.09 ng TEQ g-1 and 0.03-3.63 ng/L, respectively. Although the ecological risk assessment suggests that the PAHs pollution in surface water and sediment poses a low risk, we recommend more attention to the protection of the mangrove ecosystem. This study reveals that mangrove leaf falling might be a significant mechanism of PAH sequestration in the mangrove system, which deserves more attention in future research.

J	Li, Y; Wang, Q; Anderson, NJ; Yang, XD				Li, Yu; Wang, Qian; Anderson, N. John; Yang, Xiangdong			Cladocera responses to climate changes and treeline shifts in an alpine lake-catchment since the Last Glacial Maximum	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The study of alpine lake ecosystem ontogeny provides an understanding of how climate dynamics and the associated catchment changes impact on lake functioning. Here, a high-resolution subfossil Cladocera sedimentary record, together with geochemistry proxies, from an alpine, treeline lake (Cuoqia Lake) in SW China were analyzed to understand the lake ecosystem response to changes in the regional Indian summer monsoon (ISM) climate and the local mountain environment since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ca. 19.5 cal kyr BP to present). The results show that the cladoceran record from Cuoqia Lake clearly responds to long-term climate change and significant climate events. The lake was depauperate in cladoceran species throughout the late glacial period (ca. 16-11 cal kyr BP) but Daphnia longispina-group and Chydorus sphaericus were the pioneer taxa when the lake was formed. The rapid proliferation of open-water and littoral cladoceran taxa began with increasing water temperature. The Younger Dryas (YD) cold event was recorded by high abundance of the cold-tolerant taxon C. sphaericus during ca. 12-11 cal kyr BP. At the onset of the Holocene (ca. 11 cal kyr BP), Alona spp. and macrophyte-associated taxa became dominant while numbers of C. sphaericus decreased dramatically. In the mid- to late-Holocene, the productivity of Cuoqia Lake seemed to have increased as reflected by higher Cladocera concentration and the appearance of Ceriodaphnia spp. and raptorial P. pediculus which are common in high nutrient waters. Partial Redundancy Analysis (partial-RDA) results highlight the strong effect of indirect climate change (mediated via catchment processes) on cladoceran assemblages during the Holocene. Abrupt shifts in sediment geochemical proxies and regional catchment vegetation at ca. 11 cal kyr BP indicate that substantial nutrient inputs, treeline advancement, and soil development in catchment resulted from the intensified ISM. Therefore, the cladoceran community changes suggest a long-term direct response of the alpine lake ecosystem to climate change since the LGM, but one that was strongly mediated by catchment-vegetation processes, such as the treeline shifts.

Species sorting and seasonal dynamics primarily shape bacterial communities in the Upper Mississippi River	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Bacterial community structure (BCS) in freshwater ecosystems varies seasonally and due to physicochemical gradients, but metacommunity structure of a major river remains understudied. Here we characterize the BCS along the Mississippi River and contributing rivers in Minnesota over three years using Illumina next-generation sequencing, to determine how changes in environmental conditions as well as inputs from surrounding land and confluences impacted community structure. Contributions of sediment to water microbial diversity were also evaluated. Long-term variation in community membership was observed, and significant shifts in relative abundances of major freshwater taxa, including alpha-Proteobacteria, Burkholderiales, and Actinomycetales, were observed due to temporal and spatial variations. Environmental parameters (e.g. temperature, rainfall, and nutrient concentrations) primarily contributed to differences in phyla abundances (88% of variance), with minimal influence from spatial distance alone (<1% of variance). Furthermore, an annually-recurrent BCS was observed in late summer, further suggesting that seasonal dynamics strongly influence community composition. Sediment communities differed from those in the water, but contributed up to 50% to community composition in the water column. Among water sampling sites, 34% showed significant variability in BCS of replicate samples indicating variability among riverine communities due to heterogeneity in the water column. Results of this study highlight the need for a better understanding of spatial and temporal variations in riverine bacterial diversity associated with physicochemical gradients and reveal how communities in sediments, and potentially other environmental reservoirs, impact waterborne BCS.

These AFPs have weak freezing point depression activity, perhaps to avoid sudden, uncontrolled growth of ice. Here, we report on an uncharacteristically powerful bacterial AFP found in an Antarctic strain of the bacterium, Marinonionas primoryensis. It is Ca (2+)-dependent, shows evidence of cooperativity, and can produce over 2 degrees C of freezing point depression. Unlike most AFPs, it does not produce obvious crystal faceting during thermal hysteresis. This AFP might be capable of imparting freezing avoidance to M. primoryensis in ice-covered Antarctic lakes. A hyperactive bacterial AFP has not previously been reported. (c) 2005 Federation of European Microbiological Societies. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However the adaptive significance of alternative morphs has been poorly documented. The aim of this study is to determine food partitioning of two heterochronic morphs of the Alpine newt, Triturus alpestris, in mountain lakes. The morphs differ in the functional morphology of their feeding apparatus. Only paedomorphs are able to expel water during prey suction behind the mouth through gill slits. We observed a substantial trophic differentiation between morphs in all lakes. Paedomorphs preyed mainly on plankton, whereas metamorphs foraged on terrestrial invertebrates that fell upon the water surface. This resource partitioning may facilitate the coexistence of the alternative morphs in lakes devoid of vertebrate competitors. Food diversity may thus favour the evolutionary maintenance of facultative polymorphism in natural populations.					; Schabetsberger, Robert/AAE-8038-2020	Schabetsberger, Robert/0000-0001-7859-6690; Denoel, Mathieu/0000-0002-3586-8323													0028-1042					FEB	2004	91	2					81	84		10.1007/s00114-003-0492-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-003-0492-6								14991145					WOS:000189206300004
J	Kuai, YL; Wells, MG				Kuai, Yulong; Wells, Mathew G.			Frequency and duration of weak thermal stratification and hypoxia in the shallow western basin of Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Polymictic lakes are not always continuously mixed; they often experience alternating periods of mixing and weak stratification. The shallow western basin of Lake Erie is one example of a polymictic basin where the frequency of mixing has important consequences for water quality. In this study, we capture high-frequency data from the summers of 2021, 2022, and 2023, including water temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), and water current velocity. This dataset allows us to show that hypoxic events (<2 mg/L) are triggered by episodes of weak stratification in Pigeon Bay, in western Lake Erie. Our five sampling sites in Pigeon Bay were located 50 m to 20 km from an important nearshore municipal water intake that supplies drinkable water to similar to 66,800 residents and to the second largest greenhouse cluster in the world. Between June and September in these 3 years, we found that Pigeon Bay was stratified with a vertical temperature difference above 2 degrees C, for respectively 45 % (2021), 54 % (2022), and 25 % (2023) of the time. Significantly, all the hypoxic events were associated with stratified events. During the sampling periods, stratified events and hypoxic events were induced by either 1) local surface heating or 2) advection of hypolimnetic water from central Lake Erie. The majority of the hypoxic events in Pigeon Bay (83 % in 2021, 86 % in 2022, and 67 % in 2023) were associated with the horizontal transport of cold water that originated over 20 km from the central basin of Lake Erie.																			0380-1330					AUG	2025	51	4							102596	10.1016/j.jglr.2025.102596	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2025.102596		JUL 2025											WOS:001540922200021

An unprecedented scientific data volume at the multi-exabyte scale will be delivered to particle physics experiments at CERN. This amount of data has to be stored and the corresponding technology must ensure fast and reliable data delivery for processing by the scientific community all over the world. The present LHC computing model will not be able to provide the required infrastructure growth even taking into account the expected hardware evolution. To address this challenge the Data Lake R&D project has been launched by the DOMA community in the fall of 2019.

The scheme is based on four properties: importance, hazard, sensitivity to enrichment and sensitivity to recovery. Lake size, conservation status and legislative requirements were used to assess importance. The anthropogenic total phosphorus (P) load estimated from land cover, livestock and population data was used as a measure of the eutrophication hazard. Lakes with a retention time > 3 days were considered to be sensitive to enrichment. The Wederbum depth (an estimate of the average summer thermocline depth) was used to predict the potential response of a lake to nutrient reduction. Lakes which were mainly stratified or fully stratified during the summer were expected to respond quickly to remediation. An initial Tier 1 risk assessment was made for all standing waters in GB (approximately 14,300 with surface area greater than 1 ha), using the four parameters derived from nationally available, GIS-based data sources held in the GB Lakes Inventory. Of the 2362 important lakes in GB, the system identified 1736 with low hazard but under potential threat because of their high sensitivity to enrichment. The system assessed that the ecology of 212 was likely to be damaged by eutrophication owing to high hazard and high sensitivity but with relatively poor chance of recovery following remediation. A further 332 lakes were considered to be damaged but were likely to respond to rehabilitation. In summary, the risk-based prioritisation system performed well and provides a useful tool for assessing standing waters at risk of eutrophication on a national basis. Inevitably, however, the need for nationally available datasets at Risk Tier I results in data resolution issues and errors may occur. The results highlight the importance of data validation using lake-specific information at Risk Tier 2.

There are Paleozoic-Mesozoic metamorphic units based on the stratigraphic sequence in the region and that units include reservoir rocks in the geothermal field. There are Quaternary alluviums, Phyo-Quaternary volcanic rocks such as basalt, basaltic tuf, tuf-basalt, basalt with gravel and Late Paleozoic metamorphic series in the field from top to base, respectively. Quaternary alluviums and Phyo-Quaternary volcanic rocks show the cap rock features. Structurally, there are right-lateral faults with NW-SE directional, which constitute in Neo-tectonic period, Middle Miocene in the field. Aim of this study is investigation of hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical properties of a geothermal field, eastern Turkey. In this study, samples were taken from 34 points including springs, wells, and analyzed in Muradiye-Caldiran geothermal field; eight of them are hot water, one of them is mineralized water and 25 of them are cold water. Geothermal springs are parallel to the faults. Also, physical measurements such as pH, EC and temperature were applied in-situ and as a result of measurements temperature changes between 8.8 degrees C and 34.7 degrees C, pH changes between 6.80 and 8.81 and EC changes between 60 and 3420 mu S/cm. When geophysical studies examined which are carried out in the center of the field (Caldiran-Ayrancilar) for the purpose of investigation of geothermal energy resources, is seen a little geothermal activity zone, is not seen very active tectonic and detected a geothermal field with low enthalpy. In geophysical studies which are carried out for the purpose of detecting spread of aquifer and layers in the general of the field, thickness of alluviums are nearly 25 meters and volcanic rocks nearly 120 meters and thickness of metamorphic series is not known.

Multivariate statistical analysis has been used to extract information from the SIMS images. Images of the particles have been separated from the image background, which significantly improved our ability to acquire the composition of individual aerosol particles. Montana forest fire aerosol was predominantly submicrometer, well within the respirable range (PM2.5), and had a characteristic surface composition identified as the amides of stearic acid and palmitic acid. Sea salt showed a layered structure of organic compounds on the surface of aqueous NaCl. The Asian Dust event could be clearly distinguished from normal Salt Lake City particulate pollution.

We present the results from two research cruises on total Hg (HgT) and methylmercury (MeHg) distributions in aqueous and particulate phases, and in offshore sediments. Open waters of Lake Superior are similar in HgT content to Lakes Michigan and Ontario (subng L-1), whereas MeHg was only 1% of HgT. Seasonality in aqueous HgT distribution was observed, most likely from tributary inputs during Spring snowmelt. Suspended particles were enriched in MeHg relative to water and surficial sediments, suggesting enhanced particle partitioning followed by demethylation in the water column and in surface sediments. Distribution coefficients for mercury in surficial sediments were lower than those in suspended material, likely due to remineralization. Preliminary estimates of mass balance indicate that air-water exchange processes such as evasion and wet deposition dominate the HgT budget, due to the basin's relatively small watershed area relative to lake area. In contrast, methylmercury cycling within Lake Superior is influenced more strongly by watershed sources, as well as by sedimentary sources and photodemethylation. The Hg cycle in Lake Superior is unique in that it is more similar in many aspects to that in marine systems than in small lakes, where management data for freshwaters typically originates.

Two treatments were randomly applied to cages: (i) control (herbivory not allowed), and (ii) fifty beetles added at the beginning of the season. Leaves were marked individually and the production of new leaves was followed until October. 3. In both treatments the production of floating leaves continued until the end of August but declined towards the end of summer. Herbivory did not affect the number of leaves produced, i.e. the plants did not compensate for the loss of leaves. 4. Leaf longevity was reduced dramatically (up to approximately 60%) when herbivores were present, Leaves that emerged during the most intense period of larval growth had a life-span one-third of that of the control group.

We focused on a 10-km northeastern shoreline of Pyhajarvi, where the potential groundwater discharge areas are associated with the esker aquifers. The methods used during 2008 and 2009 involved winter mapping, lake water and lake bed sediment temperature measurements, pH and electrical conductivity measurements, seepage meters, mini-piezometers, and chemical (PCE/TCE) and isotopic tracers. The main aims of this study were to compare the applicability of the methods used and evaluate the results obtained. The results from the various methods correlated and confirmed the groundwater discharge (4.69 x 10(-5) cm s(-1) to 4.80 x 10(-3) cm s(-1)) into lake water at the shoreline.

This study makes a multi-scale assessment over a time span of 30 years of environmental rehabilitation in one of the world's most degraded areas: the Tigray highlands of Northern Ethiopia. The study shows that in Tigray sheet and rill erosion rates have decreased by approximately 68%, infiltration and spring discharge are enhanced and vegetation cover has improved. These impacts are evidenced and quantified by a comprehensive comparison of the current landscape with a coverage of 30-year old photographs and substantiated by field investigations.

Staurastrum chaetoceras, well-known for its abundant occurrence in eutrophic lakes, showed a higher photosynthetic capacity and a higher maximum (intrinsic) growth rate than Cosmarium abbreviatum var. planctonicum, a taxon only encountered in oligo-mesotrophic habitats. The two taxa are comparable in cell size. When grown under a stringent continuous inorganic phosphorus (P-i) limitation C. abbreviatum realized a higher growth rate, due to a higher affinity for the uptake of P-i, than S. chaetoceras. On the other hand, under those conditions, S. chaetoceras displayed a two times higher maximum P-i uptake rate (V-max). Regarding cellular alkaline phosphatase activity (hydrolysis of the organic P substrate MFP) C. abbreviatum showed both a higher affinity and maximum rate than S. chaetoceras. In a way, these characteristics reflect the distribution pattern of the two species in the field. For in eutrophic lakes, during the summer algal bloom, species often have to compete for light as the growth limiting factor, whereas species occurring in oligo-mesotrophic lakes usually face permanently growth-limiting P concentrations. Since in eutrophic lakes during summer algal bloom dissolved inorganic P concentrations can also be low, the ability of phytoplankton to acquire P-i from short-lived pulses (e.g. excretion of P by zooplankton or fish) has to be considered an important additional characteristic in view of competition. Concerning the two desmid species under discussion, S. chaetoceras will have a competitive advantage when P-i is supplied in distinct pulses, due to its higher V-max values. On the other hand, C. abbreviatum possibly will be superior in competition for organic P substrates. In the species studied, different strategies were found to benefit optimally from the resource conditions inherent in the trophic state of their habitat.

Large populations of two introduced and congeneric goby species (Rhinogobius giurinus and Rhinogobius cliffordpopei) now co-occur in Lake Erhai, a plateau lake in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau (China). Herein we quantified the spatio-temporal distribution of the two species to determine whether spatial segregation occurred within the same ecosystem. A total of 67,819 individuals of R. giurinus and 36,043 of R. cliffordpopei were sampled across four seasons. The results indicated that R. giurinus mostly occupied profundal habitat (PH) while R. cliffordpopei mainly used littoral habitat (LH). Correlation analysis revealed the abundance of R. giurinus was positively associated with deep water, silt and coarse sand substrata, whereas the distribution of R. cliffordpopei was positively associated with high densities of macrozooplanktons and high abundances of other fish species, high concentration of dissolved oxygen and high densities of submerged macrophytes. Except in spring, the body condition of R. giurinus was significantly higher in the PH than in the LH. The body condition of R. cliffordpopei did not differ significantly between habitats in the four seasons. These findings demonstrate that the two congeneric and introduced goby species occupy distinct habitats, indicating that spatial segregation enables coexistence of the two invasive species at high abundances within an ecosystem.					; Cucherousset, Julien/B-5709-2011; Li, Zhongjie/J-1474-2018; Liu, Shengbo/JAZ-9733-2023	Ye, Shaowen/0000-0003-3932-8401; Cucherousset, Julien/0000-0003-0533-9479													1863-9135					OCT	2012	181	3					241	251		10.1127/1863-9135/2012/0397	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1863-9135/2012/0397													WOS:000311493900007

Analysis of 129I in lichens by accelerator mass spectrometry through a microwave-based sample preparation method	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS					11th International Conference on Accelerator Mass Spectrometry	SEP 14-19, 2008	Rome, ITALY	CEDAD, Univ Salento, CIRCE, Second Univ Naples, INNOVA, LABEC, Ist Nazl Fis Nucl, Abdul Salam Int Ctr Theoret Phys				The presence of I-129 in the environment has been strongly influenced by the artificial nuclear emissions since the beginning of the nuclear era in the mid 20th century. In order to know more about the different sources and their relative impact in different zones, it is necessary to complete the amount of measurements of this radionuclide in environmental samples. In this work, I-129 has been determined in lichen samples (Cladonia alpestris) from Rogen Lake in Central Sweden. A method based on microwave digestion was developed for these measurements in order to improve speed and reduce contamination. Based on this method, I-129 concentrations in some lichen samples from Lake Rogen (Sweden) have been measured, showing the impact of the Chernobyl accident and nuclear fuel reprocessing plants.

Hydrological characteristics of three North African coastal lagoons: insights from the MELMARINA project	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Hydrological and hydrodynamic characteristics are important controls in all wetlands including coastal lagoons. Enhanced understanding of lagoon functioning can be obtained through the acquisition and interpretation of hydrological, meteorological and related data. The MELMARINA Project investigated links between hydrological and ecological conditions within North African coastal lagoons. It employed three primary sites: Merja Zerga in Morocco, Ghar El Melh in Tunisia and Lake Manzala in Egypt. Hydrological, meteorological and related data were acquired for these lagoons. Data included precipitation, evaporation, wind speed and direction, freshwater discharges into the lagoons, tides beyond the lagoons in the open sea, lagoon bathymetry and time series of lagoon water levels/depths. Data were acquired from secondary sources (including online archives) and targeted field survey and monitoring programmes. Interpretation of these data provides insights into the hydrological functioning of the lagoons and contributed to the modelling requirements of MELMARINA. The functioning of Merja Zerga is dominated by the exchange of water between the Atlantic and the lagoon. Large, tidally induced oscillations in water level are responsible for the inundation of extensive inter-tidal mudflats whilst the rapid replacement of water by exchanges with the sea diminishes the influence of freshwater inflows and winter rainfall. The smaller Mediterranean tides reduce the magnitude of lagoon-sea exchanges and result in much smaller water level oscillations within Ghar El Melh. As a result, this lagoon lacks the inter-tidal environments found within the Moroccan site and hydrodynamic conditions are more likely influenced by wind set up. Although freshwater inflows to Ghar El Melh are smaller than those in Merja Zerga, their effects, coupled with heavy winter rainfall, can persist due to longer residence times of water within the lagoon. Freshwater inflows are central to the functioning of Lake Manzala. Large discharges of relatively freshwater are provided by major drains which cross the Nile Delta. These influence lake water levels and are responsible for the freshwater conditions within large parts of the lake. The small tidal range of the eastern Mediterranean, coupled with constricted connections with the sea, reduces the influence of lake-sea exchanges and tidally induced water level oscillations within Lake Manzala.

The epidemiology of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis in the USA, 1962-2008	EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION												Naegleria fowleri, a free-living, thermophilic amoeba ubiquitous in the environment, causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), a rare but nearly always fatal disease of the central nervous system. While case reports of PAM have been documented worldwide, very few individuals have been diagnosed with PAM despite the vast number of people who have contact with fresh water where N. fowkri may be present. In the USA, 111 PAM case-patients have been prospectively diagnosed, reported, and verified by state health officials since 1962. Consistent with the literature, case reports reveal that N. fowleri infections occur primarily in previously healthy young males exposed to warm recreational waters, especially lakes and ponds, in warm-weather locations during summer months. The annual number of PAM case reports varied, but does not appear to be increasing over time. Because PAM is a rare disease, it is challenging to understand the environmental and host-specific factors associated with infection in order to develop science-based, risk reduction messages for swimmers.																			0950-2688	1469-4409				JUL	2010	138	7					968	975		10.1017/S0950268809991014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0950268809991014								19845995					WOS:000279078500007

Grazing impacts of rotifer zooplankton on a cyanobacteria bloom in a shallow temperate lake (Vancouver Lake, WA, USA)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Grazing by microzooplankton has been shown to significantly impact freshwater cyanobacteria blooms; however, the contribution of rotifers to the overall effect of microzooplankton grazing is not well understood. We conducted monthly microzooplankton community grazing (dilution) experiments June-October 2019, concurrent with incubations of field-collected rotifers feeding upon the natural assemblage of microplankton prey < 75 mu m in Vancouver Lake (Washington State, USA), a lake annually affected by cyanobacteria blooms. Our results showed that just days after a large bloom, the microzooplankton community grazing impact on phytoplankton biomass was exceptionally high (> 1000% d(-1)), yet the impact by rotifers was low (< 1% d(-1)). As the bloom diminished in September and October, the grazing impact of rotifers increased dramatically, specifically consuming substantial dinoflagellate (<= 574%) and ciliate (<= 382%) biomass daily. Analysis of rotifers in Vancouver Lake during these months showed the presence of large, carnivorous Asplanchna spp., which indicates multi-trophic grazing dynamics within the rotifer assemblage. We conclude that non-rotifer micro-grazers (i.e., ciliates) were likely responsible for the initial dissipation of cyanobacteria just after the bloom peak, while rotifers primarily removed micro-grazers later in autumn. This study highlights the trophic roles of micro-grazers in controlling harmful cyanobacteria blooms and quantifies the specific grazing contributions of rotifers.					; Rollwagen-Bollens, Gretchen/Q-5520-2017	Sweeney, Kathryn/0000-0002-9643-4705; Hampton, Stephanie/0000-0003-2389-4249; Rollwagen-Bollens, Gretchen/0000-0002-5127-5720													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	2022	849	12					2683	2703		10.1007/s10750-022-04885-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-022-04885-x		MAY 2022											WOS:000799644000001

A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 12,890 fish consisting of 13 species randomly caught from 26 rivers, 10 dams, and 38 ponds/lakes. Fish, were collected in each of the rainy and winter seasons from each province. Fish were identified, counted, weighed, and digested using pepsin-HCl. Samples were examined for OV MC by a sedimentation method, and metacercariae were identified under a stereomicroscope. OV MC were found in 6 species of fish; i.e., Cyclocheilichthys armatus, Puntius orphoides, Hampala dispar, Henicorhynchus siamensis, Osteochilus hasselti, and Puntioplites proctozysron from localities in 13 provinces. Among the sites where OV MC-infected fish were found, 70.0% were dams, 23.7% were ponds/lakes, and 7.7% were rivers. The mean intensity of OV MC ranged from 0.01 to 6.5 cysts per fish (or 1.3-287.5 cysts per kg of fish). A high mean intensity of OV MC per fish (>3 cysts) was found in 5 provinces: Amnat Charoen (6.5 cysts), Nakhon Phanom (4.3), Mukdahan (4.1), Khon Kaen, (3.5) and Si Sa Ket (3.4). In conclusion, OV MC are prevalent in natural cyprinid fish, with the infection rate varying according to fish species and habitats.

This research integrates water quality assessment, arsenic enrichment, hydrogeochemical processes, groundwater recharge and carbon sources in aquifer. Total dissolved solid (TDS) contents in springs water, lake water and groundwater are in range of 681-847 mg/L, 2460-5051 mg/L and 513-7491 mg/L, respectively. The higher concentrations of magnesium and calcium in water bodies next to sodium are because of carbonates, sulfates, halite and silicates dissolution. The average concentrations of ions in groundwater are in order of HCO3- > SO42- > Cl- > Na+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ > K+ > NO3-, virtually analogous to springs water, but different from lake water, categorized as poor quality and unfit for drinking purposes. Based on major ions hydrochemistry, NaCl and mixed Ca-Mg-Cl type hydrochemical facies are associated with concentration of arsenic (4.2-39.5 & mu;g/L) in groundwater. Groundwater samples (70%) having arsenic concentration (11 & LE; As & LE; 39.5 & mu;g/L) exceeded from World Health Organization (WHO) guideline (As & LE; 10 & mu;g/L) in near neutral to slightly alkaline (6.7 & LE; pH & LE; 8.3), positive Eh(6 & LE; Eh & LE; 204 mV), signifying its oxic condition. Eh-pH diagrams for arsenic and iron indicate that 80% of groundwater for arsenic and iron were in compartments of HAsO42- and Fe(OH)(3), unveil oxic environment. Arsenic is moderately positive correlated with TDS, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, nitrate, sulfate and weak negative with & delta;C-13(DIC) in surface and groundwater, forecasting multiple sources of arsenic to aquifer. Stable isotopes of waters show recharge of groundwater from local rain and lake water. The lower & delta;C-13(DIC) values of groundwater are modified by influx of CO2 produced during biological oxidation of soil natural organic matter.

The study infers five major phases of millennial-scale climate variability with centennial-scale inversions using geochemical and magnetic proxies from relict Lesser Himalayan Lake sediments. Phase-1 (6-4 ka) is marked by enhanced precipitation/runoff (increased allochthonous contribution) under a stronger Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). The prominent reversal in the trend between-5 and 4 ka includes global arid events such as 4.2 ka. Phase-2 (4-2.2 ka) shows a declining precipitation/runoff (decreased allochthonous input) under declining ISM with a prominent dip after-3 ka. After phase-2 the climate reversals are distinct and of shorter (centennial) duration. For example, in Phase-3 (2.2-1.4 ka) improved ISM is inferred; Phase-4 (1.4-1.0 ka) is marked by a sharp decline in the ISM, and Phase-5 (<1.0 ka) includes centennial-scale events of Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and the onset of Little Ice Age (LIA). The relative increase (decrease) in the concentration of geochemical and magnetic proxies is indicative of strengthened (weakened) ISM where relatively drier phases are in sync with the North Atlantic climate perturbations. We observed clustering of optically dated flood events around 6.5, 4.5, 2.6, 1.4, 0.8, and 0.4 ka which corresponds to periods of moderate ISM thus, suggesting a coupling between warm-humid monsoon and relatively dry westerlies. The relatively higher concentration of micro-charcoal in the lake sediments indicates widespread forest fires around 5.9-5.3, 4.5-4.3, 3.4-3.0, 2.0-1.5 and-1 ka. Given the archaeological evidence of sedentary settlements since-3 ka in the upper Ganga catchment, the study speculatively argues anthropogenic forcing for forest fires after 3 ka. Further, the highest probability flood phases succeed the fire events and may be indicative of enhanced vulnerability of the catchment to floods due to vegetation loss (enhanced erosion and surface runoff).(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Climate Change Impacts on the Phenology of Laurentian Great Lakes Fishes	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Freshwater ecosystems around the world are increasingly impacted by climate change, yet there remains a lack of long-term empirical data on how these changes are manifesting. In the Laurentian Great Lakes, a globally significant freshwater system, fish and their habitats are expected to be affected by warming water temperatures and increasing risks of species invasions. Despite these projections, relatively few studies have documented whether such shifts are already occurring. Our objective was to assess how climate change has influenced the community and migration phenology of native and non-native fishes that use coastal wetlands in the Great Lakes. To do so, we analyzed local summer water temperatures and a 27-year dataset (1997-2023) comprising arrivals of 16 fish species intercepted at the Cootes Paradise Marsh Fishway, a common carp (Cyprinus carpio) exclusion barrier at the western end of Lake Ontario. Over the study period, we found that mean summer water temperatures increased by over 1 degrees C, consistent with broader global warming trends. Using non-metric multidimensional scaling, we observed a unidirectional shift in fish community structure over time, rather than cyclical fluctuations or stabilization, indicating sustained ecological change. Analyses on phenology revealed that first, peak, and last arrival dates occurred earlier over time, while the duration of presence at the Fishway decreased for both native and non-native species. These results provide evidence that climate change is already altering the community and phenology of fishes in Great Lakes wetlands. More broadly, our findings contribute to the growing body of literature showing that climate-driven phenological shifts are reshaping freshwater ecosystems globally, underscoring the need for adaptive, climate-informed conservation and management strategies.

Two sediment cores were zoned into annual layers according to profile concentrations of organic matter, N, P and diatom frustules. Sedimentation rate was 26 mm .cntdot. yr-1 between 1958 and 1973. Below the 25 mm depth, P and diatom profiles were most obvious because clay particles entering the reservoir during spring runoff covered the biological material precipitated the previous year. This mechanism effectively prevents internal recycling of nutrients, particularly P, from the bottom sediments.																									1977	34	5					669	676		10.1139/f77-103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f77-103													WOS:A1977DE08300010

At deep metalimnia, light spectra are enriched in photons of the central part of the spectrum (500-600 nm) and benefit Chromatiaceae, brown-coloured Chlorobiaceae and phycoerythrine-containing cyanobacteria. Their carotenoids (okenone, spiriloxanthine, isorenieratene) and phycoerythrines allow these phototrophic bacteria to use light from the narrow central spectral wavebands. Otherwise, shallow metalimnetic communities receive light from a wide range (400-800 nm) and their composition is more diverse and usually enriched in green-coloured Chlorobiaceae, which are unable to take advantage of the central part of the spectrum. Gilvin compounds (humic substances dissolved in water), have strong effects on light absorption, especially at shorter wavelengths. Therefore, light spect-ra in lakes with high gilvin contents are enriched in photons of long wavelengths (> 600 nm). Several Wisconsin lakes with different gilvin contents were studied during the period of summer stratification in 1994. Spectral distribution of light reaching their metalimnia changed with increasing gilvin contents (measured as g(440)). In the latter, phototrophic metalimnetic bacterial communities were absolutely dominated by green-coloured Chlorobiaceae. Intermediate lakes could experiment changes on their community composition depending on variations in gilvin content, as happened in Little Long lake. The dynamics of this lake was studied during summer 1995. The ratio of green-coloured species in respect to brown-coloured species increased after a sudden increase of gilvin due to strong rainfall. These results agree with the photosynthetic advantage of green-coloured Chlorobiaceae under led-light illumination, inferred from laboratory experiments, and suggest a bacteriochlorophyll-dependent, light-harvesting strategy of these phototrophic sulphur bacteria.

Seasonal and spatial patterns differ between intracellular and extracellular antibiotic resistance genes in urban stormwater runoff	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-ADVANCES												Antibiotic resistance is a public health threat that is exacerbated by the dispersion of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) into aquatic environments. Urban stormwater runoff has been recognized as a source of and a mechanism by which intracellular ARGs (iARGs) can be transported into receiving environments. The prevalence and behavior of extracellular ARGs (eARGs) in stormwater, however, has yet to be considered. This study quantified four iARGs and eARGs under baseflow and stormflow conditions. Urban stormwater runoff was found to be a source of all the ARGs examined, with the absolute concentration of all iARGs and two eARGs (ermF and tetC) increasing significantly (p < 0.05) between baseflow and stormflow. The occurrence of iARGs and eARGs in stormwater runoff was also investigated across three seasons to differentiate temporal trends. All eARGs were found to be most abundant in the fall, while the iARGs did not display a consistent seasonal trend. Following, spatial patterns of the ARGs were elucidated by targeting four sampling locations, including direct runoff from a curbside storm inlet and a stormwater outfall, and two receiving environments, the Menomonee River and Lake Michigan. Stormwater was found to have the largest impact, in terms of the percent increase in ARG concentrations between baseflow and stormflow, on the outfall location where on average the iARGs and eARGs increased 16% and 12.3%, respectively. The variability in seasonal and spatial trends between the iARGs and eARGs suggests a difference in sources and transport mechanisms of the ARGs into the environment.

The membrane is featured universally by lipids which possess saturated polyisoprenoid chains in the hydrophobic moiety. This paper concerns the surface properties of Langmuir membranes made of archaeal lipid models (AL) bearing a phytanyl group or (3RS, 7R, 11R)-3,7,11,15-tetramethylhexadecyI group. All of the AL provide a Langmuir membrane on an air-water interface with an abnormally low surface tension (32-37 mN/m at 20-70degreesC), while the conventional lipids having n-alkyl chains give membranes of 54-56 mN/m. The abnormally low energy surface of AL lipids is considered to arise from the bulky and fluid polyisoprenoid chain.

We found that the majority of viruses in this lake belonged to the family of Siphoviridae or were untailed, with capsid sizes ranging from 30 to 60 nm, and exhibited genome sizes ranging from 15 to 45 kb. On average, 12 different genotypes dominated each of the PFGE fingerprints. The highest genomic viral richness was recorded in summer (mean = 14 bands per PFGE fingerprint) and in the epilimnion (mean = 13 bands per PFGE fingerprint). Among the physico-chemical and biological variables considered, the availability of the hosts appeared to be the main factor regulating the variations in the viral diversity.

J	Kramer, A; Herzschuh, U; Mischke, S; Zhang, CJ				Kramer, Annette; Herzschuh, Ulrike; Mischke, Steffen; Zhang, Chengjun			Holocene treeline shifts and monsoon variability in the Hengduan Mountains (southeastern Tibetan Plateau), implications from palynological investigations	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The upper 8.45 m of a sediment core from Lake Naleng were analysed for its pollen and charcoal content to detect vegetation, climate, and human activity changes on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP) since the Pleistocene-Holocene transition (11.7 cal kyr BP). The application of pollen indicator taxa, pollen sums, biomisation, and multivariate analysis helped to reconstruct environmental conditions during the Holocene. Furthermore, 64 surface samples from the southeastern TP and its foreland were analysed to investigate the relationship between modern pollen assemblages and vegetation. The modern vegetation was recorded in the surface pollen assemblages by pollen indicator types, although sediments also contain pollen spectra extra-regional pollen transported from lower vegetation belts, which is seen as a consequence of steep elevation gradients at the southeastern margin of the TP. The relation between different vegetation belts and temperature from the modern sample sites was used to infer quantitative temperature trends for the Holocene record. Spreading of forests at the beginning of the Holocene marks the transition to warmer conditions. From 10.7 to similar to 4.4 cal kyr BP open Abies-Betula forests were found at Lake Naleng probably reflecting a stronger-than-present summer monsoon. Temperature range reconstructions suggest a temperature that was about 2-3 degrees C warmer and a treeline position that was 400-600 m higher than today. A severe climate deterioration with temperatures about 1-2 degrees C colder than before is documented by a retreating forest between 8.1 and 7.2 cal kyr BP. Forests retreated while subalpine Rhododendron shrubs spread around Lake Naleng indicating colder conditions with temperatures 1-2 degrees C below early and mid Holocene level after 4.4 cal kyr BP. The forest decline at 4.4 cal kyr BP is considered to reflect climatic conditions as low concentrations of charcoal particles found in this period exclude human-induced fires as reason for the forest retreat. However, grazing indicators imply human influence on the environment since 3.4 cal kyr BP around Lake Naleng. We therefore consider the rapid treeline shift seen at 3.4 cal kyr BP as partly generated by human activity and partly by climatic conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Reliable interpretation from the climatic records from this region are pivotal for identifying periodicities of inter-annual to multi-decadal variability and trends driven by shifts in position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the strength of the monsoons. A high-resolution multiproxy approach is presented for a similar to 3.3 m composite core, GBW, from a karst lake located in Ghayl ba Wazir, southern Yemen. Sedimentary proxies, including particle size distribution, coupled with magnetic susceptibility (MS) and geochemistry (XRF), provide a comprehensive picture of sediment depositional changes that may be linked to climate and environmental variability over the southern Arabian Desert. The chronology of the GBW core is provided by five radiocarbon (C-14) dates from terrestrial macrofossils (wood and twigs) extracted from sediment samples and indicates the core extends to similar to 900 CE. Our data indicates generally wetter conditions from 930 to 1400 CE corresponding to the "Medieval climate anomaly (MCA)" followed by arid phases during 1,410-1700 CE coinciding with the "Little Ice Age (LIA)". Evidence for a drier LIA include high authigenic calcium precipitation [Ca/(Al + Fe + Ti)], decreased TOC/TIC values, and gypsum precipitation, whereas the wetter MCA is characterized by higher detrital element ratios (Ti/Al, K/Al, Rb/Sr), and increased TOC/TIC and deposition of finer sediments (EM1). Furthermore, end-member mixing analyses (EMMA) derived from the grain-size distribution (EM2 and EM3) corroborates the deposition of coarser silt sediment through wind erosion and production of carbonate sand during the LIA concurrently with low lake levels under generally dry conditions. Aridity during the LIA is consistent with evidence and theory for weakened boreal summer monsoons during intervals of northern hemisphere cooling.					; Waldmann, Nicolas/AAC-3974-2020	Shah, Parth/0000-0002-2766-6991; 														2296-6463				DEC 7	2021	9								712443	10.3389/feart.2021.712443	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2021.712443													WOS:000741836700001

Fish fillets were characterized by good protein levels (17.6-20.4 g/100g wet fillet) and low total lipid contents (1.1-4.2 g/100 g), variable during the year, the highest levels being attained in the summer season. Whitefish were also a good source of essential minerals like selenium, zinc and iron, while very low mercury levels were detected in all samples. Rubidium and caesium were found at significantly higher levels in muscle of fish from the lakes of volcanic origin. These minerals may represent elements of traceability of the origin of fish. Total lipids were mainly characterized by low cholesterol levels (43.0-60.4 mg/100 g wet fillet) and by high proportions of total n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (21.5-32.1 % of total fatty acids). The qualitative analysis of the stomach content of whitefish evidenced a prevalence of zooplanktonic species, mainly Daphnia spp., in their diet. The levels of organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls detected in whitefish from the takes under study were always well below the Italian and European action limits.

J	Wilson, MVH; Barton, DG				Wilson, MVH; Barton, DG			Seven centuries of taphonomic variation in Eocene freshwater fishes preserved in varves: Paleoenvironments and temporal averaging	PALEOBIOLOGY												Eocene lake beds of Horsefly, British Columbia, are preserved in varves, or discrete yearly layers representing seasonal changes in the lake. These varves allow study of temporal variation and rates of change in morphological and ecological characters on a very short time scale. One of the most sensitive indicators of the paleoenvironmental conditions on the floor of the lake may be the taphonomic condition of the fishes, which vary between perfectly articulated and completely disarticulated skeletons. Patterns of disarticulation correspond to those produced by scavengers. The taphonomy supports the hypothesis that the lake was warm monomictic, circulating in the winter, at which time scavengers could gain access to the bottom of the lake. Larger-scale environmental events (on the order of hundreds of years) are suggested by the fact that the proportion of well-preserved specimens reached two peaks within the seven centuries of deposition, one peak during the second century and another during the fifth and sixth centuries. These results clearly demonstrate two principles: that taphonomy can be a sensitive indicator of paleoenvironmental conditions, and that temporal averaging can affect the taphonomic properties of this fossil site, and presumably of others with equal or lower time resolution.

However, the detrimental effects of these salts on aquatic ecosystems, vegetation, lakes, ground and surface water, and soils have become a major concern in recent years. This review aims to discuss the adverse environmental impact of using de-icing salts on the environment and explore current conventional methods used for managing and treating runoff water. Additionally, desalination techniques in terms of their effectiveness and energy requirements have been discussed. By comparing energy costs and considering the salinity levels of runoff water containing de-icing salts, electrodialysis as a potential technique is introduced to be combined with conventional approaches for removing and recovering salt from runoff water loaded from road de-icing salt.																			1747-6585	1747-6593				FEB	2024	38	1					20	31		10.1111/wej.12897	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wej.12897		AUG 2023											WOS:001044349800001
J	Kalacheva, E; Taran, Y; Kotenko, T				Kalacheva, Elena; Taran, Yuri; Kotenko, Tatiana			Geochemistry and solute fluxes of volcano-hydrothermal systems of Shiashkotan, Kuril Islands	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Shiashkotan Island belongs to the Northern Kuril island arc and consists of two joined volcanoes, Sinarka and Kuntomintar, with about 18 km of distance between the summits. Both volcanoes are active, with historic eruptions, and both emit fumarolic gases. Sinarka volcano is degassing through the extrusive dome with inaccessible strong and hot (>400 degrees C) fumaroles. A large fumarolic field of the Kuntomintar volcano situated in a wide eroded caldera-like crater hosts many fumarolic vents with temperatures from boiling point to 480 degrees C. Both volcanoes are characterized by intense hydrothermal activity discharging acid SO4-Cl waters, which are drained to the Sea of Okhotsk by streams. At least 4 groups of near-neutral Na-Mg-Ca-Cl-SO4 springs with temperatures in the range of 50-80 degrees C are located at the sea level, within tide zones and discharge slightly altered diluted seawater. Volcanic gas of Kuntomintar as well as all types of hydrothermal manifestations of both volcanoes were collected and analyzed for major and trace elements and water isotopes. Volcanic gases are typical for arc volcanoes with He-3/He-4 corrected for air contamination up to 6.4 R-a (R-a = 1.4 x 10(-6), the air ratio) and delta C-13 (CO2) within -10 parts per thousand to 8 parts per thousand VPDB. Using a saturation indices approach it is shown that acid volcanic waters are formed at a shallow level, whereas waters of the coastal springs are partially equilibrated with rocks at similar to 180 degrees C. Trace element distribution and concentrations and the total REE depend on the water type, acidity and Al + Fe concentration. The REE pattern for acidic waters is unusual but similar to that found in some acidic crater lake waters. The total hydrothermal discharge of Cl and S from the island associated with volcanic activity is estimated at ca. 20 t/d and 40 t/d, respectively, based on the measurements of flow rates of the draining streams and their chemistry. The chemical erosion of the island by surface and thermal waters is estimated at 27 and 140 ton/km(2)/year, respectively, which is 2-3 times lower than chemical erosion of tropical volcanic islands.

Siemianowka Reservoir is a huge source of crustaceans for the outflowing Narew River and results in a 33- to 307-fold increase in summer biomass of potamozooplankton. Zooplankton samples were collected from a permanently connected oxbow lake located directly behind the reservoir and from 18 oxbow lakes 10 to 180 km from the dam. The results of our study showed that crustacean zooplankton of oxbow lakes generally showed low similarity to Siemianowka Reservoir. However, a high level of zooplankton similarity was observed among oxbow lakes themselves. This could suggest that the crustacean zooplankton of the oxbow lakes in the river valley show a metacommunity structure.

Cyanobacteria were detected in summer, when water temperatures reached 20 degrees C or more. Merismopedia, non-nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, dominated the Namhan River, which had high nitrogen concentrations. In the Bukhan River, Dolichospermum, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, was dominant. Temporary nitrogen inflow into the Bukhan River due to rainfall transformed the cyanobacterial community from one dominated by nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria (Dolichospermum) to one dominated by non-nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria (Microcystis). Geosmin was highly correlated with Dolichospermum in the Bukhan River (r = 0.947, P < 0.01) and its concentration changed in accordance with Dolichospermum cell counts. In the Merismopedia-dominated Namhan River, geosmin concentrations were low, suggesting that the cyanobacterial community composition affects geosmin levels.

J	Dallimore, A				Dallimore, A			The characteristics of thecamoebians of arctic Thermokarst Lakes, Richards Island, NWT	JOURNAL OF FORAMINIFERAL RESEARCH												Thecamoebian species and assemblages reported from various limnological environments in North America are not appreciably different across a climatic gradient ranging from semi-tropical to Arctic latitudes. However, certain morphological characteristics of individual species referred to as "strains" do appear to be very sensitive to changing environmental conditions. Thus, the identification of strains is a useful technique in the interpretation of paleoenvironmental conditions. Other features considered diagnostic of Arctic conditions in particular, are assemblages dominated by one or two species, and large and coarse tests. Some thecamoebian specimens found in lakes on Richards Island, Northwest Territories, Canada, are two to three times larger than those reported from temperate locations. These "giant" specimens are perhaps related to very short periods of warm water temperatures which appear to be favorable for reproduction. Tests grow to a large size after extended feeding periods during the short Arctic summers. For the first time, continuous annual lake temperature data confirm the hypothesis that the presence of abundant large tests in an assemblage may be indicative of cold climates, due to a short reproductive season.																			0096-1191					OCT	2004	34	4					249	257		10.2113/34.4.249	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/34.4.249													WOS:000225870900001

SWAT-BASED STREAMFLOW AND EMBAYMENT MODELING OF KARST-AFFECTED CHAPEL BRANCH WATERSHED, SOUTH CAROLINA	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												SWAT is a GIS-based basin-scale model widely used for the characterization of hydrology and water quality of large, complex watersheds; however, SWAT has not been fully tested in watersheds with karst geomorphology and downstream reservoir-like embayment. In this study, SWAT was applied to test its ability to predict monthly streamflow dynamics for a 1,555 ha karst watershed, Chapel Branch Creek, which drains to a large embayment and is comprised of highly diverse land uses. SWAT was able to accurately simulate the monthly streamflow at a cave spring (CS) outlet draining mostly agricultural and forested lands and a golf course plus an unknown groundwater discharging area, only after adding known monthly subsurface inputs as a point source at that location. Monthly streamflows at two other locations, both with multiple land uses, were overpredicted when lower lake levels were prevalent as a result of surface water flow to groundwater (losing streams). The model underpredicted the flows during rising lake levels, likely due to high conductivity and also a deep percolation coefficient representing flow lost to shallow and deep groundwater. At the main watershed outlet, a wide section performing as a reservoir embayment (R-E), the model was able to more accurately simulate the measured mean monthly outflows. The R-E storage was estimated by using a daily water balance approach with upstream inflows, rainfall, and PET as inputs and using parameters obtained by bathymetric survey, LiDAR, and downstream lake level data. Results demonstrated the substantial influence of the karst features in the water balance, with conduit and diffuse flow as an explanation for the missing upstream flows appearing via subsurface conveyance to the downstream cave spring, thus providing a more accurate simulation at the embayment outlet. Results also highlighted the influences of downstream lake levels and karst voids/conduits on the watershed hydrologic balance. Simulation performance of hydrology could be improved with more accurate DEMs obtained from LiDAR for karst feature identification and related modification of SWAT parameters. This SWAT modeling effort may have implications on nutrient and sediment loading estimates for TMDL development and implementation in karst watersheds with large downstream embayments that have significant changes in water level due to adjoining lakes.

The mean flux of unsupported Pb-210 between 1790 and 1970 for the centre of the lake basin is 517 Bq m(-2) yr(-1) with maximum deviations between -23% and +27% of this value. Flux rates above this average were found between 1783 and 1813, around 1836, and between 1860 and 1901. The mean Pb-210(exc) flux rates derived were clearly lower around 1821, 1908, 1930, and 1953. The Pb-210(exc) flux reached its minimum of 344 Bq m(-2) yr(-1) during the period 1977-1982. The atmospheric flux of unsupported Pb-210 is correlated with the precipitation frequency during the summer monsoon and shows coinciding variability with geochemical proxies that document the groundwater inflow into the lake. Al2O3-rich dust of remote provenance scavenged by wet-deposition in the rainy season is the major carrier of the atmospheric Pb-210(exc) flux.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				FEB	2006	35	2					271	288		10.1007/s10933-005-0102-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-005-0102-z													WOS:000234730300003

Seasonal and vertical distribution of putative ammonia-oxidizing thaumarchaeotal communities in an oligotrophic lake	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												The discovery of Archaea carrying an amoA gene coding for the A-subunit of ammonia monooxygenase gave a boost to studies aimed at detecting this gene under diverse conditions. Despite numerous studies describing the archaeal amoA gene abundance and richness in different habitats, the understanding of the freshwater ecology of potentially archaeal ammonia oxidizers, recently positioned in the phylum Thaumarchaeota, is still lacking. In a seasonal and vertical study of deep oligotrophic Lake Lucerne, Switzerland, with high Thaumarchaeota-specific crenarchaeol concentrations, we showed that all archaeal 16S rRNA genes found belong to the thaumarchaeotal phylum. The abundances of archaeal 16S rRNA and amoA genes remained in the same order of magnitude (average 6 x mL-1) and displayed matching seasonal dynamics within 16 monthly collected samples at three different water depths (r2 = 0.80, slope of 1.06). The Thaumarchaeota in this lake form a distinct cluster in both the 16S rRNA and amoA gene phylogenies, are affiliated to other thaumarchaeotal freshwater sequences within group 1.1a Archaea, and fall in the low saline cluster of the amoA phylogeny. In accordance with temperature and conductivity, the Thaumarchaeota in the surface water showed a significantly different seasonality and lower abundance than their counterparts in the deeper waters. This study indicates that the ecology of Thaumarchaeota, with their potential in nitrogen cycling, may differ per water depth in deep freshwater ecosystems.

Currently, the detection of VHSV relies on virus isolation, which is lethal to fish and indicates only the current infection status. A serological method is required to ascertain prior exposure. Here, we report two serologic tests for VHSV that are nonlethal, rapid, and species independent, a virus neutralization (VN) assay and a blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results show that the VN assay had a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 42.9%; the anti-nucleocapsid-blocking ELISA detected nonneutralizing VHSV antibodies at a specificity of 88.2% and a sensitivity of 96.4%. The VN assay and ELISA are valuable tools for assessing exposure to VHSV.																			1556-6811	1556-679X				MAR	2014	21	3					435	442		10.1128/CVI.00675-13	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/CVI.00675-13								24429071					WOS:000332036900021

We reconstruct summer water temperatures from three climatically sensitive mountain lakes in Austria using paleolimnological methods aiming to examine long-term thermal dynamics and lakes' responses to regional climate variability since the Little Ice Age. Our results indicate divergent trends for the lakes. In two of the lakes, which are located at the sunny southern slope of mountains, water temperature has increased several degrees concurrent with the observed air temperature increase. In contrast, no change is observed in the reconstructed water temperatures of a shaded lake, located at the northern slope, where also the ecological and thermal changes are most subtle. The results indicate the importance of cold water inputs, such as snowmelt and groundwater, on lakes' thermal conditions and suggest that watershed characteristics and lake stratification play a major role in defining the lake-specific thermal regime.

A model of viscoelastic ice-shelf flexure	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												We develop a formal thin-plate treatment of the viscoelastic flexure of floating ice shelves as an initial step in treating various problems relevant to ice-shelf response to sudden changes of surface loads and applied bending moments (e.g. draining supraglacial lakes, iceberg calving, surface and basal crevassing). Our analysis is based on the assumption that total deformation is the sum of elastic and viscous (or power-law creep) deformations (i.e. akin to a Maxwell model of viscoelasticity, having a spring and dashpot in series). The treatment follows the assumptions of well-known thin-plate approximation, but is presented in a manner familiar to glaciologists and with Glen's flow law. We present an analysis of the viscoelastic evolution of an ice shelf subject to a filling and draining supraglacial lake. This demonstration is motivated by the proposition that flexure in response to the filling/drainage of meltwater features on the Larsen B ice shelf, Antarctica, contributed to the fragmentation process that accompanied its collapse in 2002.

More knowledge is needed to estimate their impacts and lessen their effects. The aim of this paper is to propose and verify a model to predict these liquid films. This model is based on modified Shallow Water equations (integral formulation). It takes into account inertia, mass transfer, gravity, gas and wall frictions, pressure, surface tension, droplet impacts, rotational effects and is unsteady. A 2D code has been developed to implement this model. A part of the model has been verified with analytical solutions (Riemann problems and inclined lake at rest), has been confronted with the linear stability of falling liquid film and has been validated with the experiment of Hammitt et al.

The fall in water level of 4 m between April and December 1982 was accompanied by a marked rise in pH (from 5.3 to 9.6), conductivity (from 12 to 100 .mu.S cm-1), total hardness (from 80 to 400 .mu.M) and filterable residue (from 11 to 45 mg l-1). In November 1982, maximum production of phytoplanktonic oxygen was 1120 mg O2 m-3 h-1 at the surface but declined sharply with depth because of light attenuation by suspended solids. It was much higher than that recorded in April 1982 (250 mg O2 m-3 h-1). The long shoreline and the shallowness of the lake result in a very large littoral zone. Diurnal variation in oxygen concentrations during periods of high water level indicated that the littoral zone is a very productive area of the lake. However, when the water level is low, the lake is surrounded by a wide expanse of barren mud.																			0067-1940						1987	38	3					397	408																WOS:A1987J672600007

Three restoration methods were used in order to improve the water quality, i.e. aeration of the waters overlying the bottom sediments, inactivation of phosphorus in the water column with iron sulphate and magnesium chloride and biomanipulation with pike stocking. The aim of the research was to define seasonal and spatial changes of phosphorus internal loading from bottom sediments and to compare this with previous years. We also considered changes in the process of P release when the restoration treatments were limited after 3 yr from 3 methods to 1 method. The highest phosphorus release from bottom sediments was found in the profundal zone, where in summer periods it would reach up to 29.2 mgP m(-2) day(-1). The lowest P release was observed in the littoral zone, down to a depth of 3 m, where it did not exceed 10.0 mgP m(-2) day(-1). 31% of the whole load of P released from the bottom sediments was originated from this zone. The research showed an increase of phosphorus release in the first years of restoration treatment and a systematic decrease at all stations in the following years.					; Gołdyn, Ryszard/J-1093-2018; Rosinska, Joanna/J-2864-2012	Goldyn, Ryszard/0000-0001-8325-5161; Dondajewska-Pielka, Renata/0000-0002-6761-0669; Podsiadlowski, Stanislaw/0000-0002-1712-6174; Rosinska, Joanna/0000-0002-8443-7546													0003-4088	2100-000X				MAR 8	2019	55									10.1051/limn/2019003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2019003													WOS:000461013900001

In this study, we present an organic carbon isotope (delta C-13(org)) record from Tianyang maar lake in Guangdong Province, tropical South China, covering the past similar to 250 kyr. This record reflects significant variations in the relative abundance of C-3 and C-4 biomass in the local terrestrial vegetation at orbital timescales, which we contend are primarily driven by changes in regional precipitation. Specifically, C-4 plants dominate in the drier climates of glacial periods, while C-3 plants thrive in the more humid conditions of interglacial periods. Superimposed on glacial-interglacial alternations, C-3/C-4 vegetation composition and associated precipitation exhibit high-frequency fluctuations, for which corresponding spectral analysis reveals prominent half-precession signals. This suggests a linkage between the ecosystem and hydroclimate dynamics in the study region and equatorial insolation at orbital timescales, with El Ni & ntilde;o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-like variability possibly acting as a bridging mechanism. Our findings highlight the combined influence of glacial and low-latitude insolation forcings on terrestrial ecosystems and hydroclimate in tropical East Asia, thereby enhancing our understanding of the variability and forcing mechanisms of the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) during the late Quaternary.

Results show that the high-LSWT areas at noon [13:30 local solar time (LST)] are mainly located in the southwest, south, and east of PL where the water depth is relatively shallow, while the low-LSWT regions are situated in the middle and north of PL where the water depth is relatively deep, and the spatial difference can reach 1.5 degrees C. This distribution is obviously different from the previous finding (i.e., high LSWT in middle of north of PL, and low LSWT in southwest of PL). By night (01:30 LST), the distribution is roughly consistent with that at noon, rather than opposite. This is mainly induced by the relatively high air temperature over the PL region at night, which cannot only increase the downward longwave radiation of atmosphere, but also decrease the heat transport from lake to air, favorably reducing the heat loss in PL and slowing down the cooling of PL. To reveal the effects of the spatial variations of LSWT on regional precipitation, two sets of experiments, i.e., nonupdate experiment with default LSWT and update experiment with LSWT originated from MODIS data, are conducted, and results show that UP experiment obviously improves precipitation simulation in PL region. Diagnoses indicate that the effects of LSWT on local precipitation are accomplished through adjusting the low-level upward motion and atmospheric instability.																			1939-1404	2151-1535					2025	18						16462	16472		10.1109/JSTARS.2025.3584852	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2025.3584852													WOS:001531874800009

The pH of surface waters, commonly ranging from 7 to 9, determines the speciation of triclosan (pK(a) = 8.1) and therefore its absorption of sunlight. Direct phototransformation of the anionic form with a quantum yield of 0.31 (laboratory conditions at 313 nm) was identified as the dominant photochemical degradation pathway of triclosan. Combining the photochemical parameters with actual meteorological data and field measurements allowed us to validate a model describing the behavior of triclosan in the water column of a Swiss lake (Lake Greifensee). From August to October 1999, direct phototransformation accounted for 80% of the observed total elimination of triclosan from the lake. The remaining major sink for triclosan was the loss in the outflow. Thus, during the summer season, direct phototransformation appears to be a major elimination pathway of triclosan in this lake. Based on absorption spectra and quantum yield data, the phototransformation half-lives of triclosan were calculated under various environmental conditions typical for surface waters. Daily averaged half-lives were found to vary from about 2 to 2000 days, depending on latitude and time of year.					; Singer, Heinz/B-3316-2013	TIXIER, Celine/0000-0003-2793-0948; Singer, Heinz/0000-0002-8542-3699													0013-936X					AUG 15	2002	36	16					3482	3489		10.1021/es025647t	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es025647t								12214638					WOS:000177448600004

Climate warming in the ABZ is occurring at over twice the rate of the global average, and as a result the extent, frequency, and severity of these disturbances are increasing rapidly. Disturbances in the ABZ span a wide gradient of spatiotemporal scales and have varying impacts on ecosystem properties and function. However, many ABZ disturbances are relatively understudied and have different sensitivities to climate and trajectories of recovery, resulting in considerable uncertainty in the impacts of climate warming and human land use on ABZ vegetation dynamics and in the interactions between disturbance types. Here we review the current knowledge of ABZ disturbances and their precursors, ecosystem impacts, temporal frequencies, spatial extents, and severity. We also summarize current knowledge of interactions and feedbacks among ABZ disturbances and characterize typical trajectories of vegetation loss and recovery in response to ecosystem disturbance using satellite time-series. We conclude with a summary of critical data and knowledge gaps and identify priorities for future study.

These lakes are closely linked to climate and environmental change through their heat and water budgets. We examined the intralake thermal structure at the local scale and investigated the water temperature pattern of lakes at the regional scale by utilizing extensive in situ measurements and multidate Landsat-8 remote sensing data. Our analysis indicates that the lake skin temperatures derived from satellite thermal sensors during most of the ice-free summer period effectively represent the lake bulk temperature because the lakes are typically well-mixed and without significant vertical stratification. With the relatively high-resolution Landsat-8 thermal data, we were able to quantitatively examine intralake lateral temperature differences and gradients in relation to geographical location, topography, meteorological factors, and lake morphometry for the first time. Our results suggest that wind speed and direction not only control the vertical stratification but also influences lateral differences and gradients of lake surface temperature. Wind can considerably reduce the intralake temperature gradient. Interestingly, we found that geographical location (latitude, longitude, distance to the ocean) and lake morphometry (surface size, depth, volume) not only control lake temperature regionally but also affect the lateral temperature gradient and homogeneity level within each individual lake. For the Arctic coastal plain, at regional scales, inland and southern lakes tend to have larger horizontal temperature differences and gradients compared to coastal and northern lakes. At local scales, large and shallow lakes tend to have large lateral temperature differences relative to small and deep lakes.

Linking diel patterns in community respiration to bacterioplankton in an oligotrophic high-elevation lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We examined the role of heterotrophic bacterioplankton in structuring diel patterns in community respiration (CR) in an oligotrophic alpine lake. We used continuous measurements of dissolved oxygen from both free-water and in situ incubation chambers to characterize a consistent diel pattern in oxygen drawdown with two distinct phases. CR rates averaged 15.4 times higher during the late afternoon to early night phase, which lasted for up to 5 h past dusk before rapidly transitioning to the lower rate phase, which lasted through dawn. Bacterioplankton always accounted for the majority of CR (73% seasonally averaged). We examined patterns in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and bacterial growth to determine the degree to which bacterioplankton were affecting diel variability in respiration rates. There was a diel pattern in DOC accumulation, with the magnitude of overnight drawdown of DOC (2.0 +/- 0.8 mu mol L(-1)) matching our oxygen-based estimates of the amount of DOC required to sustain higher CR rates (2.4 +/- 1.3 mu mol L(-1)). Bacterioplankton communities cultured on dusk water had growth-rate constants two times higher than those cultured on dawn water and removed the excess DOC in dusk water. Our results indicate that higher daytime CR of bacterioplankton is directly coupled to daily production of DOC at a timescale of hours, likely through phytoplankton exudation. Ignoring diel variability in CR may result in substantial underestimation of daily CR and gross primary production.					; Sadro, Steven/AGC-7944-2022; Nelson, Craig/H-3323-2019	Nelson, Craig/0000-0003-2525-3496; Sadro, Steven/0000-0002-6416-3840; 													0024-3590					MAR	2011	56	2					540	550		10.4319/lo.2011.56.2.0540	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2011.56.2.0540													WOS:000290677800011

The trace element concentrations of the major water sources of the watershed (the Dan and Banias springs) represent background values. After emergence, the waters are subjected to human activity. In crossing the populated and cultivated Hula Basin in man-made canals, the major and trace element contents increase. In comparison to the trace element concentrations, those of the major elements have narrow ranges and small temporal fluctuations. Trace element concentrations varied by 3 orders of magnitude, and temporal variations were large but not necessarily seasonal. Point sources of trace elements were urban effluents, fish pond wastes, and peat soil drainage. The trace element concentrations decrease in the waters of the last segment of the Jordan River. All measured trace elements were below the criteria levels established by regulatory agencies. Several, however, were of the same order of magnitude. Addition of wastes from enhanced recycling, and morphologic modifications of the final course of the Jordan River could result in increase in the trace element concentrations in the water.																			0177-5146					FEB	1988	11	1					35	44		10.1007/BF02587761	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02587761													WOS:A1988M171600006

Identifying driving forces of population decline is critical for biological conservation. Time-series data are especially valuable for this goal, but unfortunately, high-quality time-series data are generally lacking, hampering evidences-based conservation policy making. Objectives In this study, we examined how population growth rates of wintering waterbird species changed across 34 years (1986-2019) in response to changes in landscape context, climatic, ecological and anthropogenic factors in the Yangtze River Floodplain. Specifically: we aimed to (1) understand the factors that are correlated with the population trend of each waterbird species, and (2) identify the spatial scale at which each waterbird species responds to surrounding landscape changes. Methods We systemically collected wintering survey data from 1986 to 2019 in Shengjin Lake National Nature Reserve for six waterbird species including Oriental stork (Ciconia boyciana), Eurasian spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia), Tundra swan (Cygnus columbianus), Swan goose (Anser cygnoid), Hooded crane (Grus monacha) and White-naped crane (Grus vipio), coupled with climatic and anthropogenic data. Satellite images were analyzed to characterize ecological variables and landscape context (both in landscape and class levels). Results Our results suggested that anthropogenic landscape changes surrounding wetland habitats (i.e., landscape context) acted as the primary factors driving the waterbird population changes and were responsible for the observed population declines. In particular, increasing built-up areas and decreasing cropland areas associated with urbanization and human settlement expansion largely explained the declining population size. Our results also showed that different variables operated at a different scale of the landscape context, highlighting the importance of the surrounding landscape configuration at both small and larger scales, as built-up area was most important at around 8 km for most of the studied species, but cropland area expansion benefitted the two crane species at a larger spatial extent. The fishing ban policy implemented in 2017 provides an opportunity for reversing such declines, as positive effects of reduced human activities were observed in a portion of waterbird species. Conclusions The demonstrated strong effects of landscape context on wetland biodiversity illustrated that practical mitigating measures can increase conservation success if they not only target the wetland habitats per se but also include the surrounding non-wetland areas at larger spatial scales.					li, chunlin/KFS-0761-2024; LU, Changhu/LBI-4341-2024; Chen, Bin/AGW-2863-2022; Xu, Yanjie/HOH-2967-2023; Huang, Zheng/ABX-9353-2022	Huang, Zheng/0000-0002-8761-3787; Cao, Lei/0000-0002-1157-0303; lu, zhang hu/0000-0002-8607-7134; Chen, Bin/0000-0002-8243-3760													0921-2973	1572-9761				DEC	2022	37	12					3141	3158		10.1007/s10980-022-01518-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-022-01518-5		SEP 2022											WOS:000857992900001

Fish Communities in Water Bodies of the Southern Taiga of Western Siberia (within Tomsk Oblast)	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Data are presented on fish community structure in ponds and floodplain and mainland lakes in the southern taiga subzone of Western Siberia (within Tomsk region), where a total of 14 fish species have been recorded. The ordering of data on the fish biomass using a factor classification program has allowed us to distinguish three population groups, with one of them including three subgroups. Winter hypoxia is the most important among external factors determining the structure of fish communities. Its absence determines the presence of perch in the fish communities; in turn, the abundance of perch affects the abundance of other fish species. Therefore, the primary organization of the communities is determined by the environment and their secondary organization by the relationships between the species.					; Maria, Lyalina/ACJ-0884-2022; Interesova, Elena/AAC-9727-2020; Bogomolova, Irina/AGJ-5232-2022	Rostovcev, Aleksandr/0000-0003-1475-0606; Lyalina, Maria/0000-0002-8663-0593; Interesova, Elena/0000-0002-1148-6283; 													1067-4136	1608-3334				MAR	2020	51	2					157	165		10.1134/S1067413620020034	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1067413620020034													WOS:000534278400008

These records reveal changes in climate and human activity since 8220 cal. yr BP, and the drivers of climatic change are further discussed based on spectral analysis of Tsuga and evergreen oak pollen percentages. The pollen record indicated that the climate in the low altitude area was relatively warm and moderately dry, whereas the climate in the high altitude area was relatively cool and humid during the period 8220-4670 cal. yr BP, corresponding to the Holocene climate optimum, although the seasonality of precipitation increased between 5180 and 4670 cal. yr BP. From 4670 to 3470 cal. yr BP, the temperature declined, and the precipitation and its seasonality decreased. Between 3470 and 1860 cal. yr BP, the temperature was still relatively low, and precipitation appeared to decrease further. At the same time, human activity represented by agricultural planting began to influence this study area, but the intensity of human activity was relatively weak. After 1860 cal. yr BP, the climate was gradually becoming drier and the intensity of human activity such as deforestation and slash-and-burn agriculture increased. Spectral analysis of Tsuga and evergreen oak pollen percentages shows statistically significant periodicities of similar to 1500 and similar to 200 years at the 95% confidence level, which suggests that insolation and feedback interactions on millennial to centennial scales are the primary forcing mechanisms of the southwest monsoon and past climatic change during the Holocene in northwestern Yunnan Province, southwestern China.

Oxidation and emission of methane in a monomictic lake (Rotsee, Switzerland)	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The build-up of methane in the hypolimnion of the eutrophic Lake Rotsee (Lucerne, Switzerland) was monitored over a full year. Sources and sinks of methane in the water column were characterized by measuring concentrations and carbon isotopic composition. In fall, high methane concentrations (up to 1 mM) were measured in the anoxic water layer. In the oxic layer, methane concentrations were much lower and the isotopic composition shifted towards heavy carbon isotopes. Methane oxidation rates peaked at the interface between oxic and anoxic water layers at around 8-10 m depth. The electron balance between the oxidants oxygen, sulphate, and nitrate, and the reductants methane, sulphide and ammonium, matched very well in the chemocline during the stratified season. The profile of carbon isotopic composition of methane showed strong indications for methane oxidation at the chemocline (including the oxycline). Aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria were detected at the interface using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Sequencing the responsible organisms from DGGE bands revealed that aerobic methanotrophs type I closely related to Methylomonas were present. Sulphate consumption occurred at the sediment surface and, only towards the end of the stagnation period, matched with a zone of methane consumption. In any case, the flux of sulphate below the chemocline was not sufficient to oxidize all the methane and other oxidants like nitrate, iron or manganese are necessary for the observed methane oxidation. Although most of the methane was oxidized either aerobically or anaerobically, Lake Rotsee was still a source of methane to the atmosphere with emission rates between 0.2 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) in February and 7 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) in November.

GPR (100 MHz antenna pair) measurements were completed on the frozen lake and its permafrost margins, while high-resolution seismic data were acquired from the lake during open-water conditions in summer using a 1.5-11.5 kHz Chirp profiler. The combined use of the two profiling systems allows stratigraphic profiling in both frozen and unfrozen parts of the lake. Shallow seismic reflection images of the uppermost 4 to 5 m of sediments are compared to GPR sections, which have approximately the same horizontal and vertical resolution. Short sediment cores aid calibrate the geophysical data.

Increasing Contaminant Burdens in an Arctic Fish, Burbot (Lota lota), in a Warming Climate	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The temporal patterns of mercury (Hg), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and other contaminants in Arctic aquatic biota are usually attributed to changing atmospheric sources. However, climate variability and change is another means of altering contaminant fate and bioavailability. We show here that the concentrations of Hg and PCBs in Mackenzie River burbot (Lota Iota), a top predator fish and important staple food for northern Canadian communities, have increased significantly over the last 25 years despite falling or stable atmospheric concentrations, suggesting that environmental processes subsequent to atmospheric transport are responsible. Using a dated sediment core from a tributary lake near the Mackenzie River sampling site, we show that variations in Hg concentrations downcore are strongly associated with labile, algal-derived organic matter (OM). Strong temporal correlations between increasing primary productivity and biotic Hg and PCBs as reflected by burbot suggest that warming temperatures and reduced ice cover may lead to increased exposure to these contaminants in high trophic level Arctic freshwater biota.

Climate-induced lake dynamics in the Trans-Baikal forest-steppe ecotone	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												Quantitative dynamics, water surface area, and water level of lakes in the Trans-Baikal forest-steppe zone have been studied by spectroradiometry (Landsat satellite), gravimetry (GRACE satellite), and altimetry (Envisat satellite). The number of lakes and their water surface area correlated with precipitation (r = 0.84-0.85), summer and annual temperature (r =-0.77 to-0.9), and drought index (r = 0.95-0.97). During extremely dry periods (2006-2010), the number of lakes decreased by four (compared to 1989) and their water surface area decreased by three (compared to 2000). The rate of change in the water level of the lakes (periods of similar to 29 years) was determined.

Seasonal Patterns of Nitrogen and Phosphorus Limitation in Four German Lakes and the Predictability of Limitation Status from Ambient Nutrient Concentrations	PLOS ONE												To identify the seasonal pattern of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) limitation of phytoplankton in four different lakes, biweekly experiments were conducted from the end of March to September 2011. Lake water samples were enriched with N, P or both nutrients and incubated under two different light intensities. Chlorophyll a fluorescence (Chla) was measured and a model selection procedure was used to assign bioassay outcomes to different limitation categories. N and P were both limiting at some point. For the shallow lakes there was a trend from P limitation in spring to N or light limitation later in the year, while the deep lake remained predominantly P limited. To determine the ability of in-lake N: P ratios to predict the relative strength of N vs. P limitation, three separate regression models were fit with the log-transformed ratio of Chla of the P and N treatments (Response ratio = RR) as the response variable and those of ambient total phosphorus: total nitrogen (TN:TP), dissolved inorganic nitrogen: soluble reactive phosphorus (DIN:SRP), TN:SRP and DIN:TP mass ratios as predictors. All four N:P ratios had significant positive relationships with RR, such that high N:P ratios were associated with P limitation and low N:P ratios with N limitation. The TN:TP and DIN:TP ratios performed better than the DIN: SRP and TN: SRP in terms of misclassification rate and the DIN:TP ratio had the highest R 2 value. Nitrogen limitation was predictable, frequent and persistent, suggesting that nitrogen reduction could play a role in water quality management. However, there is still uncertainty about the efficacy of N restriction to control populations of N-2 fixing cyanobacteria.

A hydrobiid snail, Amnicola limosa, had the lowest levels of production and slowest growth rate of the 1st summer cohort in the lowest alkalinity lakes. This species failed to reproduce in one of the lowest alkalinity lakes in 1980 and has been very rare since then. Neither growth nor production of 2 spp. of pisidiid clams, Pisidium casertanum and P. ferrugineum, appeared to vary consistently with alkalinity concentration. Production and growth differences between populations in 2 intermediate alkalinity lakes indicate that factors other than alkalinity per se may be responsible for these results.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1984	62	8					1474	1478		10.1139/z84-213	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z84-213													WOS:A1984TH75800007
J	Zhu, JP				Zhu, Ji-ping			A Military/Geographical Analysis of Bronze Inscriptions on the Jinhou Su Bianzhong: A Research Centered on the Zuobo Ding and the City of Hun	BULLETIN OF THE INSTITUTE OF HISTORY AND PHILOLOGY ACADEMIA SINICA												By studying about the location of the city of Hun from the inscription on a bronze tripod casted in middle Western Zhou by the earl of Zuo state, this article hopes to systematically conduct a military and geographical analysis on the inscriptions of the bronze Jinhou Su Bianzhong (Marquis Su of Jin's Chimes) from the late Western Zhou period. With a geostrategic analysis of her data, the author was convinced that the city of Hun, which was under siege by the troops led by Guozhong, the earl of Zuo and the marquis of Cai on behalf of the Zhou royal family, was most likely situated in the southern Dongguo region, as the states of Zuo and Cai were two important vassals on the eastern plain. By comparing the pronunciation, traffic routes, ethnic origin as well as political power, the city of Hun was confirmed to show resemblance to an ancient clan named Min, whose people were active during the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties at areas near present-day Mincheng village, Jinxiang county, Shandong province. Inspired by Prof. Zhu Fenghan's speculation about the correlation between the city of Hun and the city of Xun mentioned in the bronze inscriptions of Jinhou Su Bianzhong, the author then presented an argument against the mainstream Western-Yun-Dongping-Su state-Fan county hypothesis, as it is unable to provide a reasonable explanation to the historical fact that two Su states once coexisted in the western Dongguo region during the Zhou period. Accordingly, she proposed to use the Huoshui River as the new geographical basis point instead, and proved that this could possibly lead us to a systematic solution to the debates around the military geography mentioned in the bronze inscriptions of Jinhou Su Bianzhong. With multiple evidences as well as an effective analysis, the author believes that the battleground mentioned in the bronze inscriptions of Jinhou Su Bianzhong was somewhere south of the Dayeze Lake. The river which the marquis of Jin crossed eastward, the Huo River, was also called the Danshui River in the Spring and Autumn period, and during the Zhou dynasty, this river originated at places around present-day Cao county of Shandong. The location of Suyi, cannot be confirmed, but according to the inscriptions, it should be in the upper stream area of the Huoshui River, somewhere along its eastern bank. The place where the Zhou king and marquis Su of Jin departed from each other was somewhere along the Fanshui River, which was close to Qin and Han's Dingtao county and where Liu Bang ascended to the throne. The Xun city, the last battleground, was probably the capital city of the Min state, or the city of Hun in the bronze inscription of the Zuobo Ding.																			1012-4195					DEC	2016	87		4				669	717																WOS:000390985300001

FIRST BIOLOGGING RECORD OF A FORAGING RED-THROATED LOON GAVIA STELLATA SHOWS SHALLOW AND EFFICIENT DIVING IN FRESHWATER ENVIRONMENTS	MARINE ORNITHOLOGY												Recently, Red-throated Loons Gavia stellata (RTL) have been the subject of increased interest due to their negative interactions with shipping, offshore wind farms, and other marine industry activities. This has driven a desire to quantify the behaviour and ecology of this understudied species, particularly during the non-breeding season. To achieve this, Time Depth Recorder (TDR) and Global Location Sensor (GLS) tags were deployed on individuals from several European locations. Due to an incidental mortality, one set of tags was retrieved early. The single set of tags recorded activity from June to August 2018. The TDR collected records for 14 d, providing the first ever biologging data on RTL foraging in Europe. The bird was tagged 90 km from the coast; therefore, it only used freshwater lakes and was never recorded entering saltwater. The individual mostly undertook shallow dives, with maximum and mean depths of 20 m and 5.4 m, respectively. Foraging constituted 22.9% of total activity during the sampling period. The RTL had diel foraging patterns. with dives being shallower and more frequent at times of "twilight" compared to "daylight." These results provide novel information on an RTL's diurnal patterns of water depth usage and foraging effort during the summer, demonstrating the potential of data loggers to provide key insights into the foraging ecology of this species					Daunt, Francis/K-6688-2012; Duckworth, James/GRE-8677-2022; Green, Jonathan/B-8799-2011	Lehikoinen, Petteri/0000-0002-2272-024X; Green, Jonathan/0000-0001-8692-0163													1018-3337	2074-1235				APR	2020	48	1					17	22																WOS:000528314200003
J	Carr, SJ; Lukas, S; Mills, SC				Carr, Simon J.; Lukas, Sven; Mills, Stephanie C.			Glacier reconstruction and mass-balance modelling as a geomorphic and palaeoclimatic tool	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												The reconstruction of former mountain glaciers has long been used to examine the implications of rapid climate shifts, for example at the last glacial interglacial transition, and for evaluating asynchronous behaviour of mountain glaciers compared with mid-latitude ice sheets during the Late Quaternary. Glacier reconstruction has also been used as a source of palaeoclimatic information, based on the recognition of empirical relationships between glaciers and climate. This paper reviews the application and implications of a recently revised method of glacier reconstruction (Carr and Coleman, 2007), based around glaciological principles of mass-balance. This study examines how this approach can be used to test geomorphological interpretations of former mountain glaciation and also to infer precipitation fields at sites of former glaciation. Sites of Younger Dryas niche and icefield glaciation in the British Isles demonstrate how this method can verify interpretations of marginal glaciation and begin to understand the different behaviour of outlet glaciers within the same environmental regime. Examination of a site of former niche glaciation in Southern Africa demonstrates how glacier reconstruction may be used to infer annual and seasonal precipitation values and strongly supports the idea that winter precipitation in Lesotho and SE South Africa was substantially greater than present-day values during the last glacial cycle.

Variations in their intensity and latitudinal position through an ice-age cycle have been proposed as important drivers of global climate change due to their influence on deep-ocean circulation and changes in atmospheric CO2. The position, intensity, and associated climatology of the southern westerlies during the last glacial maximum (LGM), however, is still poorly understood from empirical and modelling standpoints. Here we analyse the behaviour of the southern westerlies during the LGM using four coupled ocean-atmosphere simulations carried out by the Palaeoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PMIP2). We analysed the atmospheric circulation by direct inspection of the winds and by using a cyclone tracking software to indicate storm tracks. The models suggest that changes were most significant during winter and over the Pacific ocean. For this season and region, three out four models indicate decreased wind intensities at the near surface as well as in the upper troposphere. Although the LGM atmosphere is colder and the equator to pole surface temperature gradient generally increases, the tropospheric temperature gradients actually decrease, explaining the weaker circulation. We evaluated the atmospheric influence on the Southern Ocean by examining the effect of wind stress on the Ekman pumping. Again, three of the models indicate decreased upwelling in a latitudinal band over the Southern Ocean. All models indicate a drier LGM than at present with a clear decrease in precipitation south of 40A degrees S over the oceans. We identify important differences in precipitation anomalies over the land masses at regional scale, including a drier climate over New Zealand and wetter over NW Patagonia.

Histological examination revealed degenerative changes within the tubular epithelium, mainly in the distal tubules and collecting ducts in the kidneys and multifocal vacuolisation in the brain stem and cerebellum. Routine molecular investigations showed the presence of the DNA of an unknown alloherpesvirus in some specimens. Subsequently, three genes of the putative herpesviral genome (DNA polymerase, terminase, and helicase) were amplified and partially sequenced. A phylogenetic tree reconstruction based on the concatenated sequence of these three conserved genes implied that the virus belongs to the genus Cyprinivirus within the family Alloherpesviridae. The sequences of the sichel herpesvirus differ markedly from those of the cypriniviruses CyHV-1, CyHV-2 and CyHV-3, putatively representing a fifth species in the genus.

Direct observations of the maturity stage of living embryos in the brood pouches of females were made at frequent intervals Q to 4 hours), and the sequence of morphological changes was analyzed to estimate duration of embryonic development as well as that of the individual stages. Total embryonic development time (EDT) averaged 3.2 d; the duration of the individual stages decreased from early to mature stages. The results were compared with theoretical values obtained from published growth models, which take into account incubation temperature and neonate mass. The model-derived EDTs were up to 30 % longer than observed. Further, the observed EDT was used to predict generation time (14.7 d), which implies that in the Baltic Sea during summer season, depending on temperature conditions, there could be 5-7 parthenogenic generations.

J	LARSSON, P				LARSSON, P			SEDIMENTATION OF POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS (PCBS) IN LIMNIC AND MARINE ENVIRONMENTS	WATER RESEARCH												The sedimentation rates of PCB [polychlorinated biphenyls] in 2 southern Swedish lakes and a coastal bay in the southern Baltic were determined using sediment traps. The rates were similar at the 3 locations and ranged from 1.2-10.9 .mu.g PCB m mo. during summer. The source for PCB in sedimenting material was probably the atmosphere. PCB concentrations in sedimenting material were higher than those in surface sediment. This may have been due to recirculation of sediment-bound PCB. The reproducibility of collecting by sediment traps was examined by deploying duplicate traps simultaneously. There were no significant differences in PCB concentration of sedimenting material between traps placed in duplicate. Concentrations of PCB in the different collecting vessel was similar within 1 trap.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1984	18	11					1389	1394		10.1016/0043-1354(84)90008-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(84)90008-3													WOS:A1984TN14500008

Photoadaptation to the polar night by phytoplankton in a permanently ice-covered Antarctic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Photosynthetic microorganisms are a primary source of new organic carbon production in polar ecosystems. Despite their importance, relatively little is known about how they adapt to the bimodal solar cycles that exist at high latitudes. To understand how phytoplankton adapt to the extreme seasonal change in photoperiod, we transplanted cultures of a well-studied laboratory model for photosynthetic cold adaptation, Chlamydomonas raudensis UWO241, back to the water column of Lake Bonney (McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica) at the depth from which it was originally cultured. The organism was suspended at this depth in dialysis tubing to allow the microalga to respond to the in situ light, temperature and dissolved ions. We then integrated in situ biological and chemical measurements with environmental molecular analyses and compared the responses of transplanted C. raudensis cultures with the natural phytoplankton community over the 6-week transition from Antarctic summer (24-h daylight) to polar night (24-h darkness). As solar radiation declined, natural communities exhibited a cessation of inorganic carbon fixation which was accompanied by a downregulation of expression of genes encoding for essential carbon fixation and photochemistry proteins. Transplanted C. raudensis cultures matched natural community trends in the regulation of photochemistry and carbon fixation gene expression, and shifted photochemical function to a shade adapted state in response to the polar night transition. We present a conceptual model for seasonal shifts in microbial community energy and carbon acquisition which integrates past cultivation-based studies in this model photopsychrophile with a body of recent work on adaptation of natural populations to polar night.

Studies were carried out to find spatial and temporal variation in physicochemical characteristics of the surface water in five basins of the dam from January 2009 to December 2010. The result showed that the mean values of temperature, Secchi Depth, pH, Dissolved Oxygen and Conductivity were 22.8 degrees C, 14.5 cm, 7.81, 7.9 mg/L and 441.7 mu S/cm. The mean values for total alkalinity, total hardness and total dissolved solids remained 120.0 mg/L, 195.9 mg/L, and 314.0 mg/L respectively. Mean values for nitrates (2.44 mg/L) resulted in higher phytoplankton count (92/ml) in the dam. In general, the water quality followed a cyclical pattern with summers favoring higher primary productivity. Except for pH and dissolved oxygen, almost all the water quality parameters varied significantly (P<0.0001) among seasons and basins with no interaction amongst them. Spatially, there was more resemblance between Mangla and Khad basins, and Poonch and Jhelum basins Temporally hot season and monsoon show more similar water quality separating them from cold season and post monsoon.

J	Liu, S; Chen, YW; Liu, JF				Liu, Sheng; Chen, Yuwei; Liu, Jinfu			Methane emissions from the littoral zone of Poyang lake during drawdown periods	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Several studies have shown that lake littoral zones often support high methane (CH4) emissions. In this study, we measured CH4 emissions from two vegetation meadows in the littoral zone of Poyang Lake, China, from October 2014 to May 2015. CH4 emissions in the meadow dominated by Carex cinerascens were 11.27 +/- 11.29 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), which were significantly higher than emissions in the meadow dominated by Artemisia selengensis (2.99 +/- 1.67 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)). Between-species differences in CH4 emission were caused by differences in belowground biomass. The results also showed distinct seasonal variation in CH4 emissions in this area; fluxes reached a maximum at the peak of the growing season and reached a minimum after the summer flood, when plants began to germinate. There were two peak values in the Carex meadow, and belowground biomass controlled the seasonality of CH4 emissions. Our results suggest that plant biomass may be a key factor controlling CH4 emissions in the littoral zone of Poyang Lake, highlighting that CH4 fluxes vary with vegetation type in littoral wetlands and demonstrating that spatial variation in CH4 emissions must be considered when estimating regional CH4 emissions in Poyang Lake. Considering climate change and the operations of a proposed hydraulic engineering project, changes to the hydrologic regime in this region may significantly affect CH4 emissions.					liu, jinfu/MIN-3970-2025; 陈, 雨薇/HKF-1175-2023; liu, shengquan/N-2119-2016														0270-5060	2156-6941				JAN 1	2019	34	1					37	48		10.1080/02705060.2018.1537941	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2018.1537941													WOS:000456021400001

Phycocyanin probes used to monitor cyanobacteria in the source and in filtered well water showed an increase of fluorescence values demonstrating a progressive seasonal growth of cyanobacteria in the source water that were correlated with cyanobacterial biovolumes from taxonomic counts (r = 0.59, p < 0.00001). A strong correlation was observed between the cyanobacterial concentrations in the lake water and in the well water as measured by the phycocyanin probe (p < 0.001, 0.73 <= r(2) <= 0.94). Log removals from bank filtration estimated from taxonomic counts ranged from 0.96 +/- (0.5) and varied according to the species of cyanobacteria. Of cyanobacteria that passed through bank filtration, smaller cells were significantly more frequent in well water samples (p < 0.05) than larger cells. Travel times from the lakes to the wells were estimated as 2 days for Lake B and 10 days for Lake A. Cyanobacterial species in the wells were most closely related to species found in Lake B. Thus, a travel time of less than 1 week permitted the breakthrough of cyanobacteria to wells. Winter samples demonstrated that cyanobacteria accumulate within bank filters, leading to continued passage of cells beyond the bloom season. Although no concentrations of total microcystin-LR were above detection limits in filtered well water, there is concern that cyanobacterial cells that reach the wells have the potential to contain intracellular toxins.

Petrozavodsk Bay (PB) lies in the north of Lake Onego and adjacent to the city of Petrozavodsk. PB water quality is controlled by anthropogenic input, inflow of the Shuya River, and water exchange with open areas of the greater Lake Onego. We measured ion composition, organic matter, nutrients, gas composition, trace elements, and mercury throughout 2016, to evaluate PB water quality. Elevated humic content and organic matter, including total organic carbon (TOC=17.0 mgL(-1)), total phosphorus (TP=36 mu gL(-1)), and water color (134 mg Pt L-1), demonstrated the eutrophic character of Shuya River input. Low humic and organic matter content (TOC = 6.5 mgL(-1), TP = 7 mu g L-1, water color = 26 mg Pt L-1) indicated the oligotrophic character of open lake waters. During winter, the PB hydrochemical regime was primarily controlled by Shuya River inflow because water exchange between the bay and open lake was restricted during its ice-covered period. As a result, PB chemical indices varied considerably. TOC varied from 7.6 to 17.8 mg L-1, TP from 7 to 55 mu gL(-1), and O-2 from 69% to 87% saturation during this period. Total filterable mercury concentrations (THg = inorganic mercury plus methylmercury) at all measurement sites remained low. Overall, these results help constrain understanding of lake dynamics, anthropogenic influence, and river input to the lake during ice-covered periods.

New data on the Lateglacial period of SW Europe: a high resolution multiproxy record from Laguna de la Roya (NW Iberia)	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												High-resolution multiproxy analyses were performed on a 128 cm section of organic sediments accumulated in a small mountain lake in NW Iberia (Laguna de la Roya, 1608 m asl). The pollen stratigraphy together with radiocarbon dating provided the basis for a chronology ranging from 15,600 to 10,500 cal yr BP. Chironomid-inferred July air temperatures suggest a temperature range from 7 to 13 degrees C, also evidencing two well-established cold periods which may be equivalent to the INTIMATE stages GS-2a and GS-1. Furthermore, a number of short cold events (with summer temperatures dropping about 0.5-1 degrees C) appear intercalated within the Lateglacial Interstadial (possibly equivalent to the INTIMATE cold events GI-1d, GI-1c2 and GI-1b) and the early Holocene (possibly equivalent to the 11.2 k event). The temperature variations predicted by our reconstruction allow explaining the changes in local conditions and productivity of the lake inferred from the biological record of the same sediment core. Furthermore, they also agree with the local and regional vegetation dynamics, and the main oscillations deduced for the vegetation belts. Based on its chronology our multiproxy record indicates a similar temperature development in NW Iberia as inferred by the Greenland delta O-18 record, the marine deep-sea records off the Atlantic Iberian Margin, and other chironomid-based Lateglacial temperature reconstructions from Europe. Nevertheless, the impact of most of the less intense Lateglacial/early Holocene cold events in NW Iberia was most probably limited to very sensitive sites that were very close to ecotonal situations. Particularly, our new pollen record indicates that they were represented as three minor environmental crises occurring during the Lateglacial Interestadial in this area. The Older Dryas event (in our usage corresponding to the Aegelsee Oscillation in Central Europe and event GI-1d in central Greenland) has previously been described in this region, but its age and duration (ca 14,250-14050 cal yr BP) is now better constrained. The two subsequent stages, La Roya I (ca 13,600-13,400 cal yr BP) and La Roya II (ca 13,300-12,900 cal yr BP) have been described for first time in NW Iberia. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS EFFECT ON LAND USE CHANGE IN THE CENTRAL RIFT VALLEY OF ETHIOPIA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Climate change and variability have been one of the challenges to socioeconomic and environmental sustainability in the twenty-first century. Meteorological analyses of historical drought occurrences are common in East Africa, but studies devoted to its effect on land use change are yet limited. This paper aimed to assess the long-term rainfall and temperature variability and its effects on farmers' land use change in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia over the past 30-36 years using a combination of meteorological and socioeconomic data. Results show that the overall coefficient of variation for rainfall was more than 35% for rainy seasons. Out of the 36 years, total rainfall of the rainy season showed negative anomalies for about half of these years. Summer season rainfall started after the average time of onset for about 42% of the database years, and it ceased ahead of the average time of the stop for about 56% of these years. As a result of such rainfall shortage and variability, about 82% of the drought-vulnerable farmers had already changed their land use from pastoralist/agropastoralist to mixed farming while 10% have a wish to shift to other land use options in the future. Hence, future policies need to consider strategies that strengthen the adaptation capacity of farmers to climate change in East Africa.					wu, wei/K-6052-2019	Wu, Wei/0000-0001-7335-2638													1589-1623	1785-0037					2019	17	4					7693	7713		10.15666/aeer/1704_76937713	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1704_76937713													WOS:000478066700034

During summer stratification Mn2+, probably of sediment origin, accumulated in the hypolimnetic bottom waters to a concentration of 50 .mu.m. Release occurred in 2 stages and appeared to be related to the supply of organic material to the sediment. No Fe2+ or dissolved S2+ were detected in the water column, although they were measured in the interstitial waters of the sediment. FeS formation in the sediment controls the Fe2+ and dissolved S2- concentrations and so minimizes the concentration gradients at the sediment-water interface. Electron acceptors other than O2 are capable of oxidizing Fe2+ and S2- ions in the water column. Alkalinity and pH were the only other chemical components to vary appreciably with depth, reflecting the biological processes of photosynthesis, respiration and decomposition. Fe and humic substances simultaneously increased in the surface waters after a major flood, indicating that they are both present in the solution in contact with the soils of the catchment.

Recent studies indicate that it is one of the most dominant invasive fish species in Serbian waters. Feeding habits based on stomach contents of individuals caught in Lake Sava were analyzed as a first step towards evaluating its possible negative impact on the native fish fauna of the lake. The following indices for diet analysis were applied: vacuity index, frequency of occurrence, numerical abundance and prominence value. Trophic niche breadth and seasonal trophic diversity were calculated using the Shannon's index. The diet spectrum comprised 16 different prey categories from five groups: Mollusca, Crustacea, Insecta, Teleostei and plants. Fish were the main prey in all seasons, followed by aquatic invertebrates. Plant material and terrestrial insects were used as food in relatively small quantities. Predation on fish eggs was also detected. Our research confirmed that this species is an opportunistic generalist. An ontogenetic diet shift was also detected. The lowest value of trophic diversity was found in age 1+ individuals (H=1.39), while the highest was found in age 3+ individuals (H=2.00). The widest niche breadth was recorded in spring 2011 (H=2.12).

The information on each varve from the uppermost core section was compared with a 35 yr meteorological dataset. Snowmelt intensity, which is an index reflecting the energy available for sediment transport, correlates well with the median grain- size measured for each varve, as well as with the weight of the 10- 20 and 20-60 mum fractions. The proportion of fine silt also correlates with low intensity summer precipitation. This methodology allows us to decipher the climatic control on sedimentary processes and yield a new perspective for constructing models which link climate to sediments that contain few biological remains. This model can then be used to infer paleoclimate with annual resolution from the downcore grain- size analysis.

Modelling streamflow and phosphorus fluxes in the Lake of the Woods watershed	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												This study provides an evaluation of streamflow and the spatial and temporal variability of phosphorus (P) fluxes for the transboundary Lake of the Woods (LoW) watershed using the Canadian version of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (CanSWAT). The model calibration and validation generally indicate good performance for the simulated flow, especially for the Rainy River, the main tributary to LoW, while the sediment and nutrient calibration performance was satisfactory. Model results indicated Rainy River is the primary source of total phosphorus (TP), contributing about 88% of the external non-point source (NPS) and point source P loads to LoW, with the majority being NPS. Simulated TP loads varied seasonally with over approximately 60% occurring during the spring period and varied spatially across the LoW watershed. TP yields tended to be lower upstream of Rainy Lake in the Precambrian Shield (a.k.a., Canadian Shield) and higher downstream of Rainy Lake in the Glacial Lake Agassiz lakebed, particularly in the Lower Rainy and Little Fork sub-watersheds. Point sources along the Rainy River constituted the largest anthropogenic TP source. Tributary P loads estimated by the model were also used in a simple lake mass-balance model that suggested 32-46% of TP load to LoW was retained within the lake.

Insights into toxic Prymnesium parvum blooms: the role of sugars and algal viruses	BIOCHEMICAL SOCIETY TRANSACTIONS												Prymnesium parvum is a toxin-producing microalga that causes harmful algal blooms globally, which often result in large-scale fish kills that have severe ecological and economic implications. Although many toxins have previously been isolated from P. parvum, ambiguity still surrounds the responsible ichthyotoxins in P. parvum blooms and the biotic and abiotic factors that promote bloom toxicity. A major fish kill attributed to P. parvum occurred in Spring 2015 on the Norfolk Broads, a low-lying set of channels and lakes (Broads) found on the East of England. Here, we discuss how water samples taken during this bloom have led to diverse scientific advances ranging from toxin analysis to discovery of a new lytic virus of P. parvum, P. parvum DNA virus (PpDNAV-BW1). Taking recent literature into account, we propose key roles for sialic acids in this type of viral infection. Finally, we discuss recent practical detection and management strategies for controlling these devastating blooms.					; O'Neill, Ellis/N-3805-2014; Murrell, John/B-1443-2012; Kuhaudomlarp, Sakonwan/AAO-1251-2021; Malin, Gill/C-6985-2009; Currie, John/A-9717-2011	Field, Rob/0000-0001-8574-0275; O'Neill, Ellis/0000-0002-5941-2806; Kuhaudomlarp, Sakonwan/0000-0003-4415-3781; Pratscher, Jennifer/0000-0002-6861-4661; Brooks, Elliot/0000-0003-1583-0712													0300-5127	1470-8752				APR 17	2018	46		2				413	421		10.1042/BST20170393	http://dx.doi.org/10.1042/BST20170393								29540506					WOS:000430260700019

Fishes of the Blackwater River Drainage, Tucker County, West Virginia	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												The Blackwater River, a tributary of the upper Cheat River of the Monongahela River, hosts a modest fish fauna. This relatively low diversity of fish species is partly explained by its drainage history. The Blackwater was once part of the prehistoric, northeasterly flowing St. Lawrence River. During the Pleistocene Epoch, the fauna was significantly affected by glacial advance and by proglacial lakes and their associated overflows. After the last glacial retreat, overflow channels, deposits, and scouring altered drainage courses and connected some of the tributaries of the ancient Teays and Pittsburgh drainages. These major alterations allowed the invasion of fishes from North America's more species-rich southern waters. Here we review fish distributions based on 67 surveys at 34 sites within the Blackwater River drainage, and discuss the origin and status of 37 species. Within the Blackwater River watershed, 30 species (20 native, 10 introduced) have been reported from upstream of Blackwater Falls, whereas 29 (26 native, 3 introduced) have been documented below the Falls. Acid mine drainage, historic lumbering, and human encroachment have impacted the Blackwater's ichthyofauna. The fishes that have been most affected are Salvelinus fontinalis (Brook Trout), Clinostomus elongatus (Redside Dace), Nocomis micropogon (River Chub), Hypentelium nigricans (Northern Hog Sucker), Etheostoma flabellare (Fantail Darter), and Percina maculata (Blackside Darter). The first two species incurred range reductions, whereas the latter four were probably extirpated. In the 1990s, acid remediation dramatically improved the water quality of the river below Davis. Recent surveys in the lower drainage revealed 15 fishes where none had been observed since at least the 1940s; seven of these (Cyprinella spiloptera [Spotfin Shiner], Luxilus chrysocephalus [Striped Shiner], Notropis photogenis [Silver Shiner], N. rubellus [Rosyface Shiner]; Micropterus dolomieu [Smallmouth Bass]; and Etheostoma camurum [Bluebreast Darter] and E. variatum [Variegate Darter]) represent additions to the faunal list of the Blackwater River.																			1528-7092	1938-5412				OCT	2015	14				7		297	313		10.1656/058.014.sp725	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/058.014.sp725													WOS:000365594500022

Effect of temperature changes on the reproductive cycle of roach in Lake Geneva from 1983 to 2001	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												In Lake Geneva, the surface water temperature has increased by 1 degrees C over 20 years probably as a result of climate change. The effects of changes in temperature on the reproductive cycle of the roach Rutilus rutilus were assessed in a 19 year survey. Over time, spawning tended to begin earlier. The consequences of temperature changes were assessed on two different stages of the female reproductive cycle: the development of the ovaries from the beginning of autumn to ovulation, and the onset of the spawning period. The development of the ovaries was studied for 7 consecutive years from October to June. From I October to the onset of spawning, it was possible to assess the gonado-somatic index (I-G) of females in terms of time expressed as a sum of degree-days. The correlation between I-G and the sum of degree-days was +0.97. The onset of the roach spawning period in Lake Geneva was triggered by a thermal threshold (median and range 190 +/- 10 degree-days for the 15 previous days). From October to April, climate warming accelerated the development of gonads, then in May, a thermal threshold that triggered the onset of roach spawning occurred earlier.

J	Huang, SX; Chun, X				Huang, Shixin; Chun, Xi			Optical Stimulation Luminescence Dating of Deltas Revealed the Early to Mid-Holocene Lake-level Fluctuations of Daihai, Inner Mongolia, Northern China	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Lake-level reconstruction of inland enclosed lakes especially for monsoon-sensitive areas is of great significance to reveal regional climate changes. Daihai, a typical enclosed lake at the marginal of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) area in north China, is sensitive to climate changes due to its unique regional characteristics. There were a series of lakeshore terraces, highstand lacustrine sediments, and braided river deltas, providing sufficient geomorphologic and stratigraphic evidence for the reconstruction of lake-level fluctuations of Daihai. Reconstructed lake-level variations during the early and mid-Holocene were constructed based on 22 quartz optical stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages from six well-preserved profiles around Daihai Basin. Our results indicated Daihai showed a relatively low level at 10.2 ka, and a gradually increasing lake level following the enhanced monsoon precipitation during the mid-Holocene. Specifically, the high lake level began to develop at 8.1 ka and reached the maximum at 5.2 ka, with similar to 40 m higher than present. At this time, the lake area expanded to similar to 400 km(2), approximately six times as large as that of present, corresponding to the maximum monsoon precipitation and intensity of EASM during the mid-Holocene. However, our stratigraphic records showed a part of the depositional records in the north and east of the Daihai was missed after 5.2 ka, probably indicating a sudden drop of the Daihai lake level. These rapid level fluctuations were likely to be interpreted by some local scenarios and need to be further investigated in the future. Overall, the lake-level fluctuation of Daihai during the early and mid-Holocene was slightly different from that observed in the previously published regional records. Possibly, the interaction of the EASM and regional feedback from topography, and hydrology factors might have contributed to the spatial complexity and distinction.

The main secondary geological hazards are rock fall and collapse, landslide, debris flow, dammed lake, sand liquefaction and so on. The development and distribution rules of secondary geo-hazards, with a long-term sustainability and a formation of hazard chains, are of relation with earthquake fault zone, and consistent with seismic intensity. The buildings located in secondary geo-hazards areas with a high risk are damaged severely, thus the site selection for post-earthquake reconstruction and related geotechnical engineering issue are discussed, which are useful in reconstruction of Wenchuan earthquake area.																			1022-6680		978-3-03785-127-2				2011	250-253	1-4					1256	+		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.250-253.1256	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.250-253.1256													WOS:000304018400240
