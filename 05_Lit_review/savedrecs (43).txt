J	SPEAR, RW; DAVIS, MB; SHANE, LCK				SPEAR, RW; DAVIS, MB; SHANE, LCK			LATE QUATERNARY HISTORY OF LOW-ELEVATION AND MID-ELEVATION VEGETATION IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS OF NEW-HAMPSHIRE	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Pollen and plant macrofossil analyses of sediments from an altitudinal series of lakes in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, USA were used to reconstruct the history of vegetation on the mountain slopes and to identify the factors responsible for vegetation change. Six sites, Mirror Lake (213 m), Lost Pond (625 m), Little East Pond (793 m), Lonesome Lake (831 m), Carter Notch Pond (1004 m), and Lake of the Clouds (1538 m), provide paleoecological records of changes in the altitudinal limits of species, the species abundances within communities, and the vegetation zones. These are supplemented by previously published data from three high-elevation sites (Spear 1989). Although past plant communities were different from modern ones, differentiation of vegetation along the slopes has always existed. At low elevations the sequence of vegetation change was: 13 700-11 500 yr BP, tundra; 11 500-9000 yr BP, transitional mixed-conifer woodlands of first spruce (Picea) and then fir (Abies balsamea), larch (Larix laricina), poplar (Populus), and paper birch (Betula papyrifera); 9000-7000 yr BP, forests dominated by pine (Pinus) and oak (Quercus); 7000 yr BP-present, mixed-hardwood forests. No late-glacial paleoecological records exist at mid-elevation sites (700-1200 m). The steep slopes at these elevations stabilized by 10 000 yr BP and an early woodland of spruce was replaced by fir, larch, and paper birch. The altitudinal limits of both white pine (Pinus strobus) and hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) expanded to mid-elevations during the mid-Holecene, suggesting great warmth 6000-4000 yr BP. The modern spruce/fir forests of mid-elevations became established 2000 yr ago as spruce expanded at all elevations, suggesting cooler, moister climate similar to today. A tree line dominated by balsam fir and black spruce (Picea mariana) was established at its modern position 10 000 yr ago and has varied little since then, although it appears to have been slightly higher than now during the early Holocene. Changes in the vegetation at low and mid-elevations have not been synchronous with those at tree line and result from a more complex set of environmental factors and climatic variables acting on several different species. At low and mid-elevations disturbance by wind and frost action was important during the late-glacial. Disturbance by fire was important during the period of spruce woodland and later in the early Holocene pine and oak forests. From 7000 yr BP to the present the primary factor disturbing New Hampshire forest was again probably wind, especially from 7000 to 4000 yr BP when higher temperatures than present may have been associated with increased frequency and intensity of thunderstorms and tropical hurricanes. The vegetation history reveals that different lapse rates have occurred along the mountain slopes. This provides evidence that the source of air masses reaching the White Mountains has varied. The boundary between alpine tundra and subalpine fir forest (tree line) most likely has always been governed by temperature (summer insolation) and wind. The montane plant communities result from individual species response rather than community response to the numerous climatic forces that have affected the mountains over the past 14 000 yr.																			0012-9615	1557-7015				FEB	1994	64	1					85	109		10.2307/2937056	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2937056													WOS:A1994MT04600004
J	Kleiner, A; Hunziker, M				Kleiner, Annick; Hunziker, Marcel			Stand-up paddling: A case study on the effect and impact pathway of information and appeals to reduce ecological conflicts	JOURNAL OF OUTDOOR RECREATION AND TOURISM-RESEARCH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												Water bodies form important habitats for animals and plants. At the same time, they offer special recreational benefits, through nature experiences, their scenic quality or as a basis for sport activities. However, high visitor numbers and problematic behaviour can lead to disturbances in nature. To maintain the recreational benefits of such public spaces and to protect nature, campaigns are a useful means, in addition to spatial interventions and legal regulations. This study evaluates a campaign to reduce negative effects on nature due to the increasingly popular activity of stand-up paddling. A written pre-post survey of the treatment group at Lake Greifensee was completed by the stand-up paddlers on site on tablets or location-independently on their own device. The control survey took place at Lake Lauerzersee, but mainly via various disseminators and social media in German-speaking Switzerland, starting with the pre-survey and ending with the post-survey at Lake Greifensee. The total sample comprised 334 people. To evaluate the campaign, behavioural predictors -based on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) (Ajzen, 1991) -and self-reported behaviour of stand-up paddlers with and without exposure to the campaign were compared. Exposure to the campaign influenced the predictor "perceived con-trol" the most; the two variables "knowledge" and "self-assessed skills" increased significantly with exposure to the campaign. The poster, which was present on site throughout the campaign, was the communication tool most perceived by stand-up paddlers. The variables that best predicted self-reported behaviour were behavioural knowledge, relevance, and self-assessed ability. The results indicate that TPB-predictors tend to be positively influenced by campaign exposure, and they point to a relationship between TPB-predictors and behaviour. However, not all components of the TPB-predictors are statistically significantly improved by campaign expo-sure, nor do they all significantly influence self-reported behaviour. Nonetheless, the results show that persuasive work improves self-reported ecological behaviour and largely confirm the impact path for persuasion as it has been theoretically proposed. Management implications:center dot A combination of information and behavioural recommendations reduce conflicts between stand-up paddlers and nature. To improve all TPB-predictors, additional efforts such as persuasion on an emotion-related basis are recommended.center dot Due to the low level of organization of the activity and because information is rarely obtained in advance, paddlers are best informed on site or in the beginning of their activity career (e.g., when buying/renting equipment).

The study is an update of the Second Assessment of Climate Change (BACC II) published in 2015 and focuses on the atmosphere, land, cryosphere, ocean, sediments, and the terrestrial and marine biosphere. Based on the summaries of the recent knowledge gained in palaeo-, historical, and future regional climate research, we find that the main conclusions from earlier assessments still remain valid. However, new long-term, homogenous observational records, for example, for Scandinavian glacier inventories, sea-level-driven saltwater inflows, so-called Major Baltic Inflows, and phytoplankton species distribution, and new scenario simulations with improved models, for example, for glaciers, lake ice, and marine food web, have become available. In many cases, uncertainties can now be better estimated than before because more models were included in the ensembles, especially for the Baltic Sea. With the help of coupled models, feedbacks between several components of the Earth system have been studied, and multiple driver studies were performed, e.g. projections of the food web that include fisheries, eutrophication, and climate change. New datasets and projections have led to a revised understanding of changes in some variables such as salinity. Furthermore, it has become evident that natural variability, in particular for the ocean on multidecadal timescales, is greater than previously estimated, challenging our ability to detect observed and projected changes in climate. In this context, the first palaeoclimate simulations regionalised for the Baltic Sea region are instructive. Hence, estimated uncertainties for the projections of many variables increased. In addition to the well-known influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation, it was found that also other low-frequency modes of internal variability, such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability, have profound effects on the climate of the Baltic Sea region. Challenges were also identified, such as the systematic discrepancy between future cloudiness trends in global and regional models and the difficulty of confidently attributing large observed changes in marine ecosystems to climate change. Finally, we compare our results with other coastal sea assessments, such as the North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment (NOSCCA), and find that the effects of climate change on the Baltic Sea differ from those on the North Sea, since Baltic Sea oceanography and ecosystems are very different from other coastal seas such as the North Sea. While the North Sea dynamics are dominated by tides, the Baltic Sea is characterised by brackish water, a perennial vertical stratification in the southern subbasins, and a seasonal sea ice cover in the northern subbasins.

S	Pradhan, BB; Shrestha, B		Baudo, R; Tartari, G; Vuillermoz, E		Pradhan, Bidya Banmali; Shrestha, Basanta			Global changes and sustainable development in the Hindu Kush-Karakoram-Himalaya	MOUNTAINS WITNESSES OF GLOBAL CHANGES: RESEARCH IN THE HIMALAYA AND KARAKORAM: SHARE-ASIA PROJECT	Developments in Earth Surface Processes											The Hindu Kush-Karakoram-Himalayan (HKKH) region, stretching 3500 km over eight countries, from Afghanistan in the west to Mynamar in the east, is home to more than 150 million people and affects the lives of three times as many in the plains and river basins below. The region is not only the world's highest mountain region, but also its most populous. The wealth of the HKKH lies in an immense diversity of flora and fauna, as well as ethnic groups and languages. It is also an important source of water, energy, and biological diversity. Yet despite this rich diversity, in reality, the HKKH regions are exceedingly fragile. Each day, climate change, pollution, as well as exploitative mining and unsound agriculture practices, take a toll on mountain environments and the most vulnerable to these changes are the inhabitants of this region. Already, they are among the world's poorest, hungriest and most marginalized people. Sustainable development of these mountain regions is a challenging task because these areas have highly diverse and fragile ecosystems. The HKKH region is geologically the youngest mountain range giving rise to a high degree of natural hazards. Specific information on ecology, natural resource potential, and socioeconomic activities is essential for sustainable development of this region. There is, however, a lack of sufficient knowledge of mountain ecosystems for the reasons of understanding of mountain specificities, the effort of International Center for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) has been to establish itself as a hub for mountain-specific knowledge, which will help in sustainable development. Among several programs ICIMOD is contributing to two important programs related to climate change: (1) glaciers and glacial lakes; and (2) trans-boundary air pollution. Glaciers and glacial lakes are the repositories of information for exploring Quaternary climate changes, as they remain sensitive to global temperature conditions. Rising temperature trends with climate change are much more pronounced in the higher altitudes causing the net shrinkage and retreat of glaciers, and the increase in size and number of glacial lakes. A number of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) have been reported in the region in the last few decades and many potential threats of more GLOF in the HKKH region have been identified, which may pose high death tolls in downstream populations, as well as destruction of property and infrastructure. Though mountains are often associated with clean air, they can receive contamination due to transport of pollution by winds. The Male Declaration on Control and Prevention of Air Pollution and its likely Trans-boundary Effects for South Asia, and Project Atmospheric Brown Cloud (ABC) seek to find the nature of transport of pollution for informed decision-making to tackle trans-boundary air pollution through regional cooperation. Initial study has shown that aerosols have led to a large reduction of surface solar radiation during winter. This may affect agriculture, health, and the hydrological cycle; eventually contribute to climate change.																			0928-2025		978-0-08-054874-6; 978-0-44-452990-9				2007	10						281	290		10.1016/S0928-2025(06)10031-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0928-2025(06)10031-0													WOS:000310921800033

Otolith microchemistry reveals contribution of hatchery-origin Walleye in Lake Oahe, South Dakota	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Objective In Lake Oahe, South Dakota, recent stockings of fingerling Walleye Sander vitreus (every year from 2017 to 2019) have coincided with increased relative abundance of catchable-size Walleye. However, it is unknown if these fish originated from hatchery stockings or were produced naturally within Lake Oahe. Thus, we sought to use otolith microchemistry to delineate wild- versus hatchery-origin Walleye in Lake Oahe.Methods In fall 2020, we collected age-0 through age-6 Walleye (n = 349) from Lake Oahe to determine fish origin during the standard gill-net survey. We used published water and otolith microchemical signatures to assign origin to collected adult Walleye. We then compared contribution of hatchery-origin fish to stocking years and locations in Lake Oahe. Additionally, we compared length at age of Walleye between both wild- and hatchery-origin fish.Results Age-1 through age-3 Walleye represented year-classes in Lake Oahe that received Walleye stockings, and 11% (age 1, 2019 year-class, 300,000 Walleye stocked), 42% (age 2, 2018 year-class, 2,082,000 Walleye stocked), and 18% (age 3, 2017 year-class, 364,500 Walleye stocked) of the fish sampled within these age-classes were of hatchery origin. No fish were classified as hatchery origin from year-classes that did not receive Walleye stockings in Lake Oahe. Hatchery- versus wild-origin Walleye exhibited no appreciable difference in length at age for all stocked year-classes, though the stocked Walleye were consistently longer than naturally produced fish. Percent contribution for each sampling location ranged from 5% to 42% hatchery-origin Walleye.Conclusions Otolith microchemistry provided a robust means to identify the contribution of stocked Walleye through age 3 in Lake Oahe. In general, greater stocking numbers corresponded to a higher percent contribution of hatchery-origin Walleye of a year-class. Hatchery-origin Walleye were found to contribute in higher proportion at sampling sites near stocking locations compared with sampling sites near the periphery of stocking locations. It appears that stocking fingerling Walleye has benefited lower Lake Oahe, and Walleye stocking should continue until Walleye natural recruitment becomes consistent and at a level suitable for sport fish harvest. We used the chemical signature of otoliths to determine if Walleye sampled in Lake Oahe, South Dakota, were produced in the wild or resulted from hatchery stocking. We found that in years when more Walleye were stocked, a higher contribution of hatchery-produced Walleye were present in lower Lake Oahe. Moreover, we found a greater contribution of hatchery-origin Walleye from sampling locations closer to stocking locations compared with sampling locations further from core stocking locations.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				OCT	2025	45	5					867	873		10.1093/najfmt/vqaf068	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/najfmt/vqaf068		AUG 2025											WOS:001547544100001
J	Adamec, L				Adamec, Lubomir			Biological flora of Central Europe: Utricularia intermedia Hayne, U. ochroleuca RW Hartm., U. stygia Thor and U. bremii Heer ex Kolliker	PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS												Utricularia intermedia Hayne, U. ochroleuca R.W. Hartm., U. stygia Thor and U. bremii Heer ex Kolliker (Lentibulariaceae, Lamiales) are the four rarest and critically endangered European Utricularia (bladderwort) species from the generic section Utricularia. They are aquatic, submerged or amphibious carnivorous plants with suction traps which grow in very shallow, standing dystrophic (humic) waters such as pools in peat bogs and fens (also pools after peat or fen extraction), shores of peaty lakes and fishponds; U. bremii also grows in pools in old shallow sand-pits. These Utricularia species with boreal circumpolar distribution (except for U. bremii) are still commonly growing in northern parts of Europe (Scandinavia, Karelia) but their recent distribution in Central Europe is scarce to very rare following a marked population decline over the last 120 years. All species have very thin linear shoots with short narrow to filamentous leaves bearing carnivorous traps (bladders, utricles) 1-5 mm large. The first three species form distinctly dimorphic shoots differentiated into pale carnivorous ones bearing most or all traps, and green photosynthetic shoots with only a few (or without) traps, while the last species usually forms non-differentiated (monomorphic) or slightly differentiated shoots. The plants exhibit a marked physiological polarity along their linear shoots with rapid apical shoot growth. Their very high relative growth rate is in harmony with the record-high net photosynthetic rate of their photosynthetic shoots. Flowering of these species is common under favourable conditions and is stimulated by high temperatures but only U. intermedia sets seeds; the other species are sterile due to pollen malformation. Some molecular-taxonomic studies indicate that U. ochroleuca and U. stygia might be hybrids between U. intermedia and U. minor. All species propagate mainly vegetatively by regular branching and reach high relative growth rates under favourable conditions. All species form spherical dormant winter buds (turions). Suction traps actively form negative pressures of ca. -0.22 to -0.25 bar. The traps are physiologically very active organs with intensive metabolism: as a result of the presence of abundant glands inside the traps, which secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients from captured prey carcasses (quadrifid glands) or take part in pumping water out of the traps and producing negative pressure (bifid glands), their aerobic respiration rate is ca. 2-3 times higher (per unit biomass) than that of leaves. Although oxygen concentrations inside reset traps are (almost) zero, traps are inhabited by many microscopic organisms (bacteria, euglens, algae, ciliates, rotifers, fungi). These commensal communities create a functional food web and in traps with captured macroscopic prey, they act as digestive mutualists and facilite prey digestion. Traps secrete a great amount of organic substances (sugars, organic acids, aminoacids) to support these commensals ('gardening'). Yet the nutritional role of commensals in prey-free traps is still unclear. Quadrifid glands can also serve in the reliable determination of three species. Ecological requirements of U. intermedia, U. ochroleuca and U. stygia are very similar and include very shallow dystrophic waters (0-30 cm deep) with highly variable levels of dystrophy, common mild water level fluctuations, oligomesotrophic to slighly eutrophic waters, optimal pH values from 5.5 to 7.0 but always high free-CO2 concentrations of 0.8-1.5 mM. Limited data indicate that U. bremii is partly a stenotopic species preferring only slightly acidic to neutral (pH 6-7), very soft to slightly hard, oligo-mesotrophic waters. Yet it can grow well both in strongly dystrophic and clear waters, in peat bogs as well as sand-pits over peaty soil and clayish sand. Longterm, very low water levels in combination with habitat eutrophication, whatever the reason, leading to peat bog and fen infilling, are the most common and unfavourable ecological threads at the most sites of the four rare Utricularia species. However, ecological consequences of high-water level at the sites can be ambiguous for the populations: it reduces the strongly competitive cyperoid and graminoid species but can speed up site eutrophication. All four species are considered (critically) threatened in European countries and are usually under official species protection or their sites are protected. Regeneration of infilled fens or peat bogs and creation of shallow fen pools and canals in these mires, combined with (re)-introductions of these species have shown to be a very successful and efficient measure to protect the natural populations for many decades. Old shallow sand-pit pools have become outstanding substitution habitats for the protection of U. bremii.																			1433-8319					JUN	2020	44								125520	10.1016/j.ppees.2020.125520	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ppees.2020.125520													WOS:000555546700008
J	King, RB; Queral-Regil, A; Stanford, KM				King, Richard B.; Queral-Regil, Alejandro; Stanford, Kristin M.			Population size and recovery criteria of the threatened Lake Erie watersnake: Integrating multiple methods of population estimation	HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												The Lake Erie watersnake, Nerodia sipedon insularurn, occurs only in the island region of western Lake Erie, an area less than 40 km in diameter. Restricted geographic distribution and declining population size resulted in this snake's classification as Threatened in the U.S. and Endangered in Ontario and Ohio. A combination of mark-recapture methods, capture rate information, and interpolation were used to estimate the current U.S. population size of Lake Erie watersnakes. A total of 121 point estimates were generated using both 'closed' population (Lincoln-Petersen, Schumacher's) and 'open' population (Jolly-Seber, Bailey's triple-catch) methods to analyze data collected from 1980-2004. Paired t-tests, comparing estimates obtained using alternative methods, were consistently non-significant. Although standard errors and confidence intervals of individual estimates were often large, standard errors of mean estimates, obtained by averaging across methods and sets of consecutive years, were markedly smaller, averaging 14% (range = 5-25%). These analyses demonstrate the utility of mark-recapture methods even in cases where sample size and recapture rates are low, as may often be true for threatened and endangered species. Another 60 estimates were obtained by applying the Lincoln-Petersen method to samples collected in consecutive years. As expected if recruitment occurs between samples, these estimates were significantly larger than those obtained using other methods. By comparing these recruitment-biased estimates to unbiased estimates, annual adult recruitment (and by extension, adult survivorship) was estimated to be 0.63. At 11 study sites for which recent (2000-2004) mark-recapture estimates were available, population density (adults/km) was highly correlated with capture rate. The regression relationship between density and capture rate was thus used to estimate watersnake population size at 19 additional sites for which only capture rate was known. Interpolations of watersnake population size were made at another 29 sites, thus encompassing the entire U.S. range of the Lake Erie watersnake. Interpolations were based on habitat suitability, land-use practices, the observed presence of watersnakes, and density at sites for which mark-recapture or capture rate estimates were available. Lake Erie watersnake densities exceeded those of many other snakes. At 30 sites for which recent estimates were available, median density = 141 adults/km of shoreline (range = 11-1107 adults/km). Mark-recapture estimates encompassing 15.8 km and capture rate estimates encompassing 19.6 km of shoreline on the U.S. islands totaled more than 6500 adult watersnakes. Including interpolated numbers at 28.3 km of uncensused shoreline to encompass the entire U.S. distribution of the Lake Erie watersnake brought this total to nearly 7700 adults. This exceeds 5555 adults, the number specified in the Population Persistence criterion of the Lake Erie Watersnake Recovery Plan. Estimates also exceeded island-specific criteria for Kelleys, South Bass, and Middle Bass Island. On North Bass Island, estimated population size (385 adults) fell short of the island-specific recovery criterion (410 adults) unless interpolated numbers at uncensused sites were included (total = 443 adults). Other criteria for delisting the Lake Erie watersnake include Habitat Protection and Management and Reduction of Human-induced Mortality. Recent land acquisitions, development of watersnake-friendly land management plans, and outreach efforts seeking to foster public appreciation and minimize watersnake-human conflicts have contributed to achievement of these goals. These actions, together with this snake's capacity for rapid population growth, make recovery and eventual delisting of the Lake Erie watersnake a real possibility.																			0733-1347	1938-5137					2006	20						83	104		10.1655/0733-1347(2007)20[83:PSARCO]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1655/0733-1347(2007)20[83:PSARCO]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000243331700003
J	LEWIS, WM; WEIBEZAHN, FH; SAUNDERS, JF; HAMILTON, SK				LEWIS, WM; WEIBEZAHN, FH; SAUNDERS, JF; HAMILTON, SK			THE ORINOCO RIVER AS AN ECOLOGICAL-SYSTEM	INTERCIENCIA												Although ecosystem terminology has been used very broadly, the analysis of ecosystems has focussed consistently on units of the environment that are functionally integrated, as shown by (1) internal reciprocity of mass flux for critical nutrients (mainly N and P), and (2) processing of organic carbon by organisms that are physically intermingled to such an extent that they regulate each others' abundances. The Orinoco basin shows continuity in mass balance but does not show the intimate functional integration of a single ecosystem. The Orinoco basin is an ecosystem complex consisting of two components (1) ecosystem cluster, and (2) transpor pathways; these two components can be distinguished by the ratio of internal flux to boundary flux: transport pathways show a ratio of less than 1.0, and ecosystems show a ratio greater than 1.0. The Orinoco complex consists of five major parts, including three transport pathways (the atmosphere, the geosphere, and the river itself, and two ecosystem clusters (terrestrial cluster and floodplain cluster). Each ecosystem cluster is made up of several distinct groups of ecosystems. The moist forest of the Guayana Shield shows a very high ratio of internal flux to boundary flux for organic carbon, phosphorus, and nitrogen. However, the absolute yields of phosphorus and nitrogen and the concentrations of inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen demonstrate failure of these ecosystems to retain potentially limiting nutrients any more efficiently than ecosystems of much lower productivity at higher latitudes. Watershed studies show that plains watersheds without montane headwaters have the lowest boundary fluxes of phosphorus and fixed nitrogen. Watersheds with montane headwaters have the highest boundary fluxes for phosphorus, and the watersheds of the Guayana Shield are intermediate. Flooplains ecosystems fall into three groups: (1) fringing floodplain, (2) internal deltaic floodplain, and (3) coastal deltaic floodplain. Only the fringing floodplain has yet been studied in detail with respect to mass balance. For the fringing floodplain as a whole, the net boundary fluxes for nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon, are near zero, indicating very high internal processing capability. During inundation, the ratio of internal to boundary fluxes briefly goes below 1.0. Ecosystems that temporarily cross this boundary can be classified as disturbed. For the fringing floodplain, the disturbance is annual and is accompanied by homogenization of many of the chemical and biological features of floodplain ecosystems in a given reach of the river. From the initial conditions, which may be termed a disturbance setpoint, adjacent ecosystems diverge along different trajectories determined by local physical conditions. The setpoint itself shows a spatial gradient because of trends in water chemistry and suspended solids from one end of the Orinoco main stem to another. Thus the characteristics of specific ecosystems along the floodplain can be explained in terms of the setpoint and the successional divergence of ecosystems from a given setpoint. Further study of the Orinoco River should include quantification of mass flux of organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus for representatives of each one of the ecosystem groups in the Orinoco ecosystem complex.

Geology of the Bear Mountain intrusive complex, Klamath Mountains, California	GEOLOGICAL STUDIES IN THE KLAMATH MOUNTAINS PROVINCE, CALIFORNIA AND OREGON: A VOLUME IN HONOR OF WILLIAM P. IRWIN	Geological Society of America Special Papers											The Bear Mountain intrusive complex, Klamath Mountains, California, is a multiphase, ultramafic to silicic plutonic suite emplaced into the Rattlesnake Creek terrane during the Late Jurassic (ca. 151-147 Ma). The intrusive complex includes five plutonic units: (1) elongated, flanking bodies of ultramafic to gabbroic rocks (Blue Ridge, Clear Creek, and Cedar Creek intrusions); (2) biotite + two-pyroxene diorite/monzodiorite of the Buck Lake plutonic unit; (3) biotite-bearing hornblende +/- pyroxene gabbro/diorite of the Punchbowl plutonic unit; (4) biotite + hornblende +/- pyroxene (+/- quartz) diorite of the Doe Flat plutonic unit; and (5) minor biotite +/- hornblende quartz diorite to tonalite/granodiorite of the Wilderness Falls plutonic unit. Units 2, 3, and 4 constitute the Bear Mountain pluton. The petrogenesis of these units involved emplacement of distinct batches of magma into the same magmatic center during a complex, multistage intrusion history. Inclusions of older units are found within younger units, and dikes related to younger units intrude older units. Mineral assemblages and Al-in-hornblende barometry indicate early crystallization of pyroxene at > 1100 degrees C and late crystallization of hornblende and biotite at > 700 degrees C between 3 and 5 kb. A dynamothermal aureole extends for similar to 600-1000 m from the external intrusive contact of the Bear Mountain pluton. Metabasic rocks within this dynamothermal aureole have been strongly deformed and recrystallized to well-foliated and lineated hornblende schist or fine-grained amphibolite and exhibit a "pluton-down" sense of shear (i.e., the Bear Mountain pluton). Adjacent to the intrusive complex, contact-metamorphic conditions were hornblende-hornfels facies and locally reached pyroxene-hornfels facies. At some localities in the inner aureole, anatexis occurred, forming migmatitic amphibolite gneiss. The effects of thermal metamorphism apparently extend >2 km from the intrusive contact and are evidenced by various mineral assemblages in metaserpentinite. A concentric, margin-parallel magmatic foliation is found throughout the main body of the Bear Mountain pluton. Map-scale evidence suggests emplacement of the Bear Mountain pluton as a series of sheetlike intrusive bodies that subsequently sagged into an oval-shaped pluton due to negative buoyancy and overall isostatic downward displacement. The three-dimensional shape of the complex is poorly known, but it may be funnel-shaped with a dense root of ultramafic rocks. The ultramafic rocks of the Bear Mountain intrusive complex are primarily cumulates from H2O- and MgO-rich basaltic parental magmas. Differentiation of these magmas gave rise to H2O- and Al2O3-rich basalt/basaltic andesite from which rocks of the Punchbowl unit accumulated. Further differentiation of this magma type resulted in the development of the parental magma for the Doe Flat unit. Magmas parental to the Buck Lake unit were similar to the Punchbowl parent, except that Buck Lake magmas were H2O poor. All of these magmas have trace-element, Sr, Nd, and oxygen isotope values characteristic of a supra-subduction zone tectonic setting. The late-stage tonalite/granodiorite magmas have geochemical signatures consistent with an origin by partial melting of metabasic crustal rocks with residual garnet; therefore, they cannot be explained by local, in situ anatexis of host rock metabasites.

J	Schmincke, HU; Sumita, M; Cukur, D				Schmincke, Hans-Ulrich; Sumita, Mari; Cukur, Deniz			Large-volume basaltic hyaloclastite eruption along a propagating land/lake lithosphere fracture at Lake Van (Eastern Anatolia): impact of volcanism on the evolution of Lake Van V	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												The Incekaya hyaloclastite cone (eastern Anatolia, Turkey), the focal point along a major eruptive fissure, was the main source of an unusually large explosive basaltic eruption. The ca. 80ka-old eruption began onshore with scoria cones from a 5km N-S fracture propagating toward Lake Van (surface area of 3755km(2)). At the intersection with the fault-bounded lake basin, a ca. 400-m-high subaerial hyaloclastite edifice formed, which can be crudely subdivided into a main lower massive bulk of hydrothermally altered lithic-rich hyaloclastites (CL) topped unconformably by a >30-m-thick, well-bedded fallout tephra (CU). The CU tephras are correlated with (1) widespread onshore hyaloclastite fallout deposits mostly west-southwest of the cone and (2) a ca. 2-m-thick, ca 80-ka-old bedded hyaloclastite (V-60), part of a 220m ICDP (International Continental Scientific Drilling Program) core, drilled in Lake Van, 27km N of Incekaya. The hyaloclastite unit was seismically identified as being the most widespread and well-defined reflector throughout much of western Lake Van. A minimum volume of >9km(3) fallout hyaloclastite tephra is estimated when the area of the seismic reflector is extrapolated to the coast and 2km inland. Seismic reflectors also suggest at least two (hyaloclastite?) intralake cones rising up to 388m above the lake sediment surface 1.5km NW off Incekaya cone and were possibly erupted along the same fracture. The total volume of hyaloclastites includes (a) subaerial Incekaya cone, (b) the inferred subaqueous continuation of the cone(s), (c) the bedded intralake and onshore deposits, and, tentatively, (d) a widespread (seismically defined) mass flow deposits directly beneath Incekaya reflector of roughly 20km(3) and may represent the deposits of explosively erupted basaltic magma. Sideromelane shards, the main clast type, are dominantly angular, and most show <<50vol.% vesicles. Less common tachylite clasts are poorly vesicular (<50vol.%). Structural transitions and interlayering between tachylite and sideromelane are ubiquitous. Fluidal and pumiceous lapilli are present in the basal massive facies. Bulk rock and glass compositions indicate constant composition of the slightly evolved Al-rich basalt magma. Olivine (Fo(78-82)) and plagioclase (An(70-80)) microphenocrysts, many skeletal with growth features, and microlites make up <1vol.% and suggest rapid magma ascent. The high explosive energy of the eruption is interpreted to be due to (1) high magma discharge rates and shearing in the eruptive jet and (2) magma-water interaction conditions. Approximate temporal coincidences with the Incekaya eruption include the following: (a) an abrupt cessation in the supply of evolved tephra from the adjacent Suphan Volcano to the lake sediments, which ended abruptly for ca. 60ky, (b) an extreme fall in lake level by ca. 150m, and (c) a drastic increase in pore water salinity (Na+ and Cl- (g/L)) and pH.

Sudeep			Paleorainfall during the past two millennia in the Western Ghats, south-western India: Evidence from a multi-proxy lacustrine sedimentary record	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The Indian monsoon, a critical component of the global climate system, plays a vital role in shaping the environmental and socio-economic landscape of the Indian subcontinent. A decreasing trend of southwest monsoon rainfall is documented in the southern part of the Western Ghats during the 20(th) century. The current study attempts to reconstruct the short- and long-term changes in monsoon during the past 1600 years based on multi-proxy studies on lacustrine sediments from Cheppandikere Lake (CK), situated in the Western Ghats in southwestern India. Three AMS C-14 dates constrain the age of sediment core collected from the lake and span the past similar to 1600 years. The environmental magnetic (chi(ARM), chi(fd) %, chi(lf), IRM, SIRM, S-ratio, and HIRM) data indicates that the magnetic mineral concentration, magnetic grain size, and mineralogy have varied significantly during the past in response to changing rainfall conditions. The diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) denote the distinctive peaks of sediment components like hematite, goethite, clay minerals, and organic matter. The temporal variation of the different sediment components is implied by the component scores obtained by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The aquatic productivity and input of terrestrial organic matter are indicated by organic carbon, C/N, delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. The multi-proxy data suggests the presence of two distinct climatic phases in the region during the past two millennia. Phase I (similar to 300-1150 AD) is characterized by lower magnetite, higher hematite, coarser magnetic grain size, finer particle size, decreased terrestrial organic matter, a higher proportion of clay minerals, enhanced aquatic productivity, and a lower proportion (52 %) of C-3 vegetation (higher C-4; 48 %) pointing towards weak monsoonal conditions. However, higher magnetite, lower hematite, finer magnetic grain size, increased terrestrial organic matter, a higher proportion of clay minerals, reduced aquatic productivity, and a higher proportion (92 %) of C-3 vegetation (lower C-4; 8 %) indicate a stronger monsoon and increasing trend of rainfall during Phase II (similar to 1150 AD to Present). The study shows that the monsoon in the Western Ghats has strengthened overall in the region and responded to global climatic episodes like the Little Ice Age (weak), Medieval Warm Period (strong) and Dark Age Cold Period (weak). A similar pattern is also seen in other lacustrine records in the Western Ghats, albeit with differences in their short-term variability.

J	Oynotkinova, NR				Oynotkinova, Nadezhda R.			THE IMAGE OF HELL IN THE SHAMANIC TEXTS OF THE ALTAIANS	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL												The aim of this article is to identify images and symbols that reveal the ideas about hell in the shamanic texts of the Altaians. The material of the study was five unpublished archival texts recorded at the beginning of the twentieth century by the ethnomusicologist A.V. Anokhin. To identify the general and the particular, the primordial and the borrowed, to establish trends and patterns in the development of the folklore genre, a comparative historical method was used. The shamanic rites of the Altaians in the past were accompanied by long oral-poetic texts usually performed by recitative singing accompanied by a tambourine. The author of the article prefers to call the analyzed texts as kamlanie 'text of the shaman' (kam 'shaman'), because she thinks that the shamanic rite and the text are an inseparable whole. The genre of the rite includes various communicative directions of discourse: invocation, spell, goodwill, request. In the traditional cosmology of the Siberian peoples, including the Turkic, the world is divided into three spheres: the upper world (celestial), the middle world (earth) and the lower world (underground). In the shamanic mythology of the Altaians, the concept of paradise is identified with the upper world, the concept of hell with the lower world. Hell is an imaginary space, a dark place located in the lower tier of the three-tiered world, the place of judgment of the human soul and the place of its punishment. The number of layers of hell corresponds to the number of underground deities: there are seven or nine of them. There are rivers, lakes and seas in hell. Evil spirits, ghosts of the dead, "unclean" demonic animals and monsters created by the god of this world, Erlik, live there. The picture of hell is also represented by images that have symbolic meanings: a black stump personifying the judge; a cast iron pot in which sinners are boiled; an old witch with goats; seven blacksmiths knocking with their tools; a boiling black lake filled with tears and blood; a staircase with nine steps going down into hell; a hair bridge from which sinners fall into the fire; a stone, associated with purgatory, through which the souls of the dead go. The listed images and symbols are the picture of the judgment and punishment of the human soul after death. A comparative analysis of the images and symbols of hell in the shamanic mythology of the Altaians with the images and symbols in the mythologies of other peoples confirms the Altaians' archaic nature of hell and suggests that the Turks of Southern Siberia could form ideas about hell on the basis of ancient archetypes characteristic of the world mythologies. So, for example, the overcoming of seven or nine obstacles by a shaman in hell resembles the sacrifice of gifts to seven underground deities in Sumerian-Akkadian mythology or the passage of the soul through nine circles of hell in Christian mythology. The formation of these ideas was due to historical migrations and contacts of the Turks with other nations.

Spatiotemporal dynamics of cyanobacterial blooms: Integrating machine learning and feature selection techniques with uncrewed aircraft systems and autonomous surface vessel data	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Cyanobacterial blooms pose significant threats to aquatic ecosystems and public health due to their ability to release harmful toxins, degrade water quality, disrupt aquatic habitats, and endanger human and animal health through contact or consumption of contaminated water. Monitoring phycocyanin (PC), a pigment unique to cyanobacteria, offers a reliable method for detecting and quantifying these blooms, enabling timely interventions to mitigate their impacts. This study aimed to evaluate ten machine learning algorithms (MLAs) for assessing the spatiotemporal variations of cyanobacterial concentrations over an oyster reef in the Western Mississippi Sound (WMS) using remotely sensed imagery from uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS) and in-situ PC concentrations measured by an autonomous surface vessel (ASV). The study further investigated the influence of river discharge and climatic variables on cyanobacterial concentrations using a time-series of cyanobacteria maps. To derive the most accurate PC retrieval model, a comprehensive set of 85 features was initially generated, including individual spectral bands, band ratios, multiple vegetation indices, and three-band indices. Feature selection was performed using a two-step approach that combined Sequential Backward Floating Selection (SBFS) and Exhaustive Feature Selection (EFS). SBFS was first used to iteratively remove features and optimize model performance, while EFS evaluated all possible combinations of the features identified by SBFS to select the best subset. Among the ten MLAs tested, Extreme Gradient Boosting emerged as the top-performing model, achieving an R2 of 0.835, a root mean square deviation of 0.419 mu g/l, an unbiased mean absolute relative difference of 0.176 mu g/l, and an average percentage difference of 18.072 % in retrieving PC concentration. The novelty of this study lies in its data-driven approach to identifying the most suitable machine learning algorithm and feature subsets for PC retrieval, thereby enhancing the accuracy and robustness of the developed algorithm. The timeseries analysis revealed substantial variations in cyanobacterial concentration in the WMS from 2018 to 2022. The highest average concentration occurred in 2019, coinciding with the introduction of diverted Mississippi River water through the Bonnet Carre<acute accent> Spillway, which triggered an unprecedented cyanobacterial bloom. Furthermore, the average PC concentration was consistently higher during the summer months, likely due to elevated air temperatures and increased sunlight promoting cyanobacterial growth. The methodology developed in this study improves the quantitative monitoring of cyanobacterial blooms using UAS imagery and provides valuable insights for future water quality monitoring initiatives in other regions.					ahmad, hafez/B-5642-2019; Panda, Rajendra/AAY-2440-2021; Panda, Rajendra Mohan/AAY-2440-2021	ahmad, hafez/0000-0001-9490-9335; Panda, Rajendra Mohan/0000-0002-5860-8022; DASH, PADMANAVA/0000-0003-3851-6830; Nur, Abduselam Mohammed/0009-0005-4706-5025													0301-4797	1095-8630				MAY	2025	381								124878	10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.124878	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.124878		APR 2025						40194492					WOS:001468524900001

During flooding events following periods of drought in many headwater wetlands, significant quantities of sulfate (SO42-) can be exported which impacts downstream surface water quality. Such periodic flood pulses of SO42- are rarely studied in detail but are a suggested cause of prolonged freshwater eutrophication. Flood pulsing events are exacerbated by the increasing severity and frequency of summer droughts along with episodic flooding. Specifically, many wetlands are fed by water from upstream reservoirs which can control wetland-stream and groundwater-surface water interactions that can impact downstream water quality. In this study, an induced flood pulse event of a forested wetland (Beverly Swamp) was arranged by scheduling an upstream reservoir drawdown event (Valens Reservoir). This orchestrated flooding event exhibited a seven-fold increase (38 to 270 mg L-1) in surface water SO42- concentrations discharging from the wetland. To elucidate the source and release time lag of these elevated SO42- concentrations, high resolution surface water sampling and discharge monitoring were coupled with stable isotopes of S (delta S-34-SO42-) and water (delta O-18-H2O and delta H-2-H2O) along with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the peat samples. Following the flood, a considerable increase in surface water SO42- concentrations was observed at sampling locations with decreases in delta S-34-SO42- values which is characteristic of oxidation following dissimilatory sulfate reduction (DSR). This indicates prior DSR resulted in the precipitation of mineral sulphides in the upper peat layers. During the pre-flood drought period, sulphides were re-oxidised to SO42- and flushed from the wetland during flooding. delta O-18-H2O values of surface and sub-surface peat soil waters reflected the horizontal and vertical travel time of reservoir water flooding the wetland and flushing SO42- from the system. Surface water acidity increased shortly after the SO42- pulse, but within a short time rebounded due to carbonate buffering capacity within the peat. A conceptual model of the SO42- budget indicated similar to 68.7 kg SO42- ha(-1) d(-1) was released from Beverly Swamp during the post flood period. This study shows that Beverly Swamp contains significant stores of reduced sulfur (S), including iron sulfides. These reduced S stores will sustain recurrent release of particularly large quantities of SO42- through redox cycling to the downstream littoral wetlands of Lake Ontario.

CURRENT STATUS OF FISH DIVERSITY AND PARASITES OF FISH IN KRASNOYARSK RESERVOIR	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL												Regulation of the Yenisei River basin has resulted in the appearance of an entirely new hydrological, hydrochemical, hydrobiological characteristics. The species composition and ichthyocenosis structure has changed under the new conditions. Biological productivity generally increases. About 30 species of fish and agnathous lived in the flood zone before the reservoir was created. Rheophilic forms were the base of ichthyocenosis (60%). The most numerous species were represented by dace, roach, perch, starlet and taimen. Currently only 25 species of fish and 1 species of agnathous inhabit the Krasnoyarsk Reservoir. The ichthyofauna diversity of the reservoir was due to the fishes in the Yenisei River mainstream, tributaries, ducts and partially to the immigrants from the lakes of the flood zone. In fact, the fishes of the Upper Yenisei were preserved and redistributed in the waters of the pond. As a result of spontaneous settlement three species (carp, verkhovka, trout) appeared in the lake, two species (cisco, peled) appeared due to the formation of pasture aquaculture and one species appeared during acclimatization (bream). Acclimatized species fully naturalized are represented by bream, carp and verkhovka (non-target species). All of them have formed self-reproducing populations. Baikal cisco and peled do not form self-reproducing populations and exist due to the constant immigration of young of the fishes. Over the last twenty years, preferential development is provided to the fish with rapid reproductive potential, with lack of food specialization and indifference to the spawning substrate and dragged spawning or summer spawning with deficiency in providing spawning areas and underdevelopment of prey. The process of parasite fauna formation apparently took place in three stages, similar to most reservoirs, meanwhile each stage was characterized by significant changes in the structure of the parasite-fauna. The first stage represents the destruction of the rheophilic complex due to the loss or reduction of the maximum number of their intermediate and definitive hosts and the beginning of the formation of the limnophilic complex, whose members are related in their development to limnophilic fish. The second stage was characterized by stabilization of the number and species of parasites. The third stage is represented by change in the parasites due to the introduction and distribution of a range of new species of fish, abiotic factors and anthropogenic impact on the pond. At present, fish of the Krasnoyarsk Reservoir are represented by 31 species of parasitic organisms, cestodes dominate in species diversity and extensiveness, trematodes and peritrichous bacteria dominate in numbers. In general, the formation of parasite fauna of fishes in the Krasnoyarsk Reservoir can be considered complete in its basic features, characteristic for this type of reservoir diseases: bothriocephaliasis, trieaenophorus, ligula and ergasilus infections.																			1561-7793	1561-803X				DEC	2012		365					218	+																WOS:000421517100043
J	CRAIG, JF; SMILEY, K				CRAIG, JF; SMILEY, K			WALLEYE, STIZOSTEDION-VITREUM, AND NORTHERN PIKE, ESOX-LUCIUS, POPULATIONS IN 3 ALBERTA LAKES	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Results are presented from a survey of walleye and northern pike in Ethel, Marie and Wolf Lakes, Alberta conducted May-September, 1983. Three types of experimental gill net were fished, mainly inshore. Northern pike were abundant in all three lakes but white sucker and yellow perch also were common. Walleye were caught in largest numbers in Wolf Lake. Age and growth of both walleye and northern pike were determined from examination of the opercular bones. The walleye in the three lakes were represented by a few strong year classess but there was no synchronism between the lakes. The strong 1975 year class in Ethel and Wolf Lakes may have been correlated with high spring precipitation and heavy run-off. Although there were dominant year classes in the northern pike populations (especially the 1979 year class) the variability was not so marked as in the walleye. There were no significant differences between length-at-age for year classes of walleye in Ethel and Marie or northern pike in all three lakes. In Wolf Lake the 1978 and 1979 year classes grew faster than in previous years. Walleye and northern pike growth was well decribed by the von Bertalanffy growth model. Females of both species grew to a greater ultimate length and had a longer lifespan than the males. Fecundity data are presented for walleye from Wolf Lake (log10 absolute fecundity = 0.856 + 2.441 log10 length) and northern pike from Marie Lake (log10 absoluble fecundity = 2.671 + 4.052 log10 length). The stomach contents of both species were examined during May and June. The majority of walleye had empty stomachs. Walleye and northern pike in Ethel and Wolf Lakes fed on a variety of fish and invertebrate species but both fed mainly on fish (in particular whitefish) in Marie Lake. The similarity of diet suggest competition for prey species. A walleye yield to commerical fishermen of c. 0.69kg ha-1 year-1 in Wolf Lake has made up 8% of the total catch. Since 1970/71 when mesh size of nets was increased, the yield has been reduced to c. 0.30 kg ha-1 year-1. Anglers remove an additional c. 0.48 kg ha-1 year-1 walleye from Wolf Lake. Northern pike yields to commerical fisherman have been c. 2.00 kg ha-1 year-1 in Wolf Lake. Ethel and Marie Lakes have yielded only poor catches of walleye and northern pike. A yield model was used to illustrate that faster-growing northern pike have higher potential yields than walleye. Walleye produce higher yields in Wolf Lake than in Marie Lake, the reverse being true for northern pike. It is suggested that northern pike could be cropped at a higher rate in Marie and Wolf Lakes with a possible improvement in walleye stocks.																			0022-1112	1095-8649				JUL	1986	29	1					67	85		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1986.tb04927.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1986.tb04927.x													WOS:A1986D611500007

WATER EXCHANGES AND PHOSPHORUS FLUX BETWEEN A RESERVOIR AND EUTROPHIC LITTORAL ZONE	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												Eutrophication of surface waters is defined by excessive algal growth, with consequences for drinking water treatment. The sources of phosphorus (P) in southern U.S. reservoirs that fuel peak algal productivity in late summer are still not fully understood. One potential source is reservoir littoral zones, which have been described as the most productive zone of a waterbody. A shallow cove named Granny Hollow in Beaver Lake, northwest Arkansas, was selected as an isolated and semi-controlled location to measure and model sources of P and its transport in a littoral area for the month of July 2018. Hydraulic and P fluxes between the reservoir and littoral area were quantified through field measurements and a 3D lake model. In quantifying hydraulic flux for the month of July, the model indicated that water tended to move into the cove along the bottom and out along the top, with a net hydraulic flux out of the cove of -723,000 m(3). Peak surface velocity in the cove averaged 2.09 cm s(-1) for the month of July, while peak bottom velocity was 1.29 cm .s(-1). Diurnally, water movement switched directions, moving out of the cove along the surface during differential heating and into the cove along the surface during differential cooling due to thermoconvective flow. During differential heating, the water velocity and hydraulic flux to the main reservoir channel along the surface of the cove were greater than the velocity and flux in the opposite direction during differential cooling. The sources of P within the cove during July included P released from bottom sediments within the cove and littoral zone and transport of P from the reservoir channel to the cove. Transport of P from the main reservoir into the cove was a result of thermoconvective flow. During differential heating, bottom waters from the main reservoir channel were transported to the surface within the littoral zone by thermoconvective currents flowing upslope from deeper to shallower waters. This resulted in P exchange between the reservoir and littoral area and is significant because it represents movement of P from the bottom of the reservoir upward into the photic zone, where it can be used for algal productivity. During July 2018, it was estimated that 13.3 kg of P were transported from the bottom of the cove to the surface by convective currents and subsequently out of the cove. This study shows that eutrophic coves represent a significant source of P to the reservoir and more importantly to the photic zone, supporting algal growth.																			2151-0032	2151-0040					2021	64	1					177	190		10.13031/trans.13979	http://dx.doi.org/10.13031/trans.13979													WOS:000618973000016

The inland lake meets a series of more harsh pollution problems yet lack of any efficient methods in fast measurement and prediction. Therefore, the measurement and prediction upon the in-land water body pollution and eutrophication became critical. Taihu Lake is one of the largest freshwater inland lakes in China, which is also the most important water source. The eutrophication in Taihu Lake is becoming more serious while the economy of Taihu lake drainage basin developing. In summer 2007, the algae bloom brake out widespread in Taihu lake. A method of Chl-a concentration measurement and prediction, base on the MODIS image data, is presented in this paper. Two components were included in the method. The first component is estimation of Chl-a concentration based on MODIS image. The DN values were derived from MODIS image data, and translated into normalized reflectance. An image-based atmosphere correction method was applied in preprocess of MODIS image data to reduce the atmospheric effect, including calculating and removing Rayleigh scattering, and removing aerosol contribution at desired wavelength, etc. Based on studying the spectral characteristic of Chl-a, the suitable MODIS bands and band combinations were correlated with Chl-a measurement. The Chl-a concentration were based on Chlorophyll Empirical Algorithm and remote sensing reflectance (R-rs). Field data were used to correct the rough Chl-a concentration data. Secondly, the eco-dynamic model in Taihu Lake was developed. Two sub-modules were included in the eco-dynamic model: the hydrodynamic model and the ecological model in lake. The eco-dynamic model had been calibrated and tested by field measured data. The hydrodynamic model was used to simulate the flow field drove by wind. The distribution of Chl-a concentration in the future could be predicted by the ecological model. Two dates of MODIS data of May 8 and May 19, 2007 in Taihu Lake, China, were used in this study. The results show that, the most serious eutrophication state occurs in the north of Taihu Lake, and the eutrophication state in the east part of the lake is better than other region, which agree well with the local measured data. The result of numerical simulations provided satisfactory result in comparison with the distribution of Chl-a concentration based on MODIS. This approach could be applied to other coastal or inland regions for the measurement and prediction of Chl-a concentration, but the specific relationship between MODIS reflectance and Chl-a may vary as a consequence of different water body. The presence of other constituents can also be investigated in the further research.

J	Wang, XL; CorteReal, J; Zhang, XB				Wang, XL; CorteReal, J; Zhang, XB			Low-frequency oscillations and associated wave motions over Eurasia	TELLUS SERIES A-DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Based on 5-day-mean grid point data for both 500-hPa geopotential height (2500) and sea level pressure (SLP) fields, and focusing on periods of 4 weeks to a year, surface and mid-tropospheric low-frequency oscillations over Eurasia are extracted by using multi-channel singular spectrum analysis (MCSSA), combined with the maximum entropy method. Besides the permanent annual cycle (365 similar to 366 days) and its second harmonic (181 days), low-frequency oscillations with periods of 55-65 and 35-45 days were found both in the mid-troposphere and at sea level, explaining a substantial number of the total variances in the relevant frequency bands. These quasi-periodicities are robust, since they are reproducible when different window lengths are used and when MCSSA is applied to two equal-length subsets of the basic data series, and since they are qualitatively different from those obtained from randomly resampled basic datasets. Moreover, no periodicities were reproduced from scrambled basic datasets. The spatial-temporal structures of these low-frequency oscillations, i.e., the associated wave motions, are presented, in order to display evolutionary processes of circulation systems probably related to the Asian monsoon variability. Some reliable information about the amplitudes of the oscillations is also obtained by using composite analysis. The 55-65 day oscillation is, in the mid-troposphere, associated with transitions between flow regimes of intense anomalies over the polar cap-Ural mountains, matched by anomalies of the opposite sign over the mid-latitudes of the Atlantic and Asia-Pacific; the anomaly centres seem to shift southwestward over Europe, westward over Asia, and poleward along the Ural mountains and over the Pacific. At sea level, it is associated with decaying anomaly centres moving southeastward over Asia-Pacific, and southwestward over Europe; its high-amplitude phases are characterized by a strong action centre dominating over northern Eurasia, matched by anomalies of opposite sign occurring over the middle-lower latitudes of the European and Pacific sectors. The 35-45 day oscillation is associated with a flow pattern characterized by a blocking structure in the mid-troposphere located over either Europe or Lake Baikal; the related anomaly centres appear to move southwestward over the Pacific, westward over Asia, poleward along the Ural mountains, and southwestward over Europe. At sea level, the anomaly centres associated with this 35-45 day oscillation appear to displace equatorward over Asia, eastward over the Pacific, and southwestward over Europe; the high-amplitude phases are characterized by a strong action centre dominating over northern Eurasia, with weakening anomalies of the opposite sign occurring simultaneously over the subtropics of east Asia-Pacific and Europe. In terms of the wave structures and wave propagation over the Eurasia sector, these two oscillations coincide with previously reported low-frequency oscillations with similar periods at the 700 hPa level. Moreover, the high-amplitude phases of the 35-45 day oscillation are intimately associated with conspicuous anomalies of precipitation over China.

Remote areas, such as the polar regions and the Tibetan Plateau, are now also exposed to microplastic contamination. However, with the impact of global warming, the transport of microplastics within the glacier-lake basins in such regions remains unclear. In this work, the Nam Co Basin in the Tibetan Plateau was selected to study the characteristics of microplastics in the rain fallout, lake water, glacial runoff, and non-glacial runoff. Fiber and films were the most common microplastic morphologies in all water samples; a higher proportion (37%) of light-weighing polypropylene and small-size (50-300 mu m, similar to 30%) microplastics were found in the glacial runoff. Air mass trajectory analysis showed that microplastics could be transported through the atmosphere over a distance of up to 800 km. For microplastic loading in lakes, the atmospheric fallout was estimated to be 3.3 tons during the monsoon season, whereas the contributions of glacial runoff (similar to 41 kg) and non-glacial runoff (similar to 522 kg) were relatively low. For the microplastic loading in glaciers, the atmospheric deposition was similar to 500 kg/yr, and the output caused by glacial melting only accounted 8% of the total atmospheric input. All these results suggested that the dominant pathway through which microplastics enter remote mountainous lake basins is atmospheric deposition, and once deposited on glaciers, microplastics will be stored for a long time. This work provides quantitative evidence elucidating the fate of microplastics in alpine lake environments.

J	Zedef, V; Russell, MJ; Fallick, AE; Hall, AJ				Zedef, V; Russell, MJ; Fallick, AE; Hall, AJ			Genesis of vein stockwork and sedimentary magnesite and hydromagnesite deposits in the ultramafic terranes of southwestern Turkey: A stable isotope study	ECONOMIC GEOLOGY AND THE BULLETIN OF THE SOCIETY OF ECONOMIC GEOLOGISTS												Vein stockworks and lacustrine developments of cryptocrystalline magnesium carbonates of Neogene and Quaternary age occur within the partially serpentinized, discontinuous ultramafic belts of southwestern Turkey. They are comparable to the Neogene cryptocrystalline magnesite bodies elsewhere in the Alpine orogen to the northwest and southeast. Our previous work (Fallick et al., 1991) suggested that cool (less than or equal to 100 degrees C) modified meteoric water was the mineralizer, that ultramafic rock was the source of the magnesium, but that there were three separate sources of the (bi)carbonate. These sources were distinguishable by their stable isotope composition as follows: (1) low-temperature carbonate with delta(18)O((SMOW)) values of similar to 36 per mil and delta(13)C((PDB)) values of similar to 4 per mil, derived from atmospheric CO2; (2) moderate-temperature carbonate with delta(18)O((SMOW)) values of +28 per mil and delta(13)C((PDB)) values of -15 per mil, derived by decarboxylation of organic-rich sediments; and (3) higher temperature carbonate with delta(18)O((SMOW)) values of similar to 19 per mil and delta(13)C((PDB)) values of similar to 3 per mil, assumed to have been generated by thermal contact metamorphism of Paleozoic marine limestone at depth. In general these magnesite deposits were found to fall into two groups, comprising carbonate generated on two mixing lines. The first group spanned the putative mixing line from the "atmospheric" source (1) to "organically derived" source of CO2 (2). The second group extended between atmospheric source (1) and the "thermal" source (3), although there were concentrations either around the atmospheric end, or precisely at the contact metamorphic end of the line. In the present study we found that large stockwork deposits at Helvacibaba and Koyakci Tepe have delta(13)C((PDB)) and delta(18)O((SMOW)) values averaging similar to-12 and similar to+27 per mil, respectively, indicating a derivation mainly by oxidation of organic-rich metasediments perhaps underthrust at depth (end-member 2), with some involvement of atmospheric carbon dioxide as bicarbonate in the circulating, hot, and modified meteoric water (end-member 1). Calcite veinlets in a meta-argillite of the Cambro-Ordovician Seydisehir Formation, most likely to have been underthrust beneath the stockworks, yielded delta(13)C((PDB)) values of -20 per mil, consistent with, though not proving, oxidized organic carbon being one of the sources of carbonate. The delta(18)O((SMOW)) values of these same veinlet carbonates are also rather low (22 parts per thousand), indicating precipitation from heated ground water, though their age is unknown. The major stratiform magnesite deposit at Hirsizdere in the center of the Menderes graben has delta(13)C((PDB)) and delta(18)O((SMOW)), values averaging similar to 3 and similar to 25 per mil, respectively and thus appears to be an example of the hydrothermal-sedimentary (i.e., exhalative) type (Ilich, 1968). In contrast, the hydromagnesite stromatolites presently growing in Salda Golu (Lake Salda) are apparently developing at cool ground-water seepages. The gross morphology of the Salda Golu stromatolites and the hydromagnesite sediments derived therefrom is reminiscent of that revealed in the Bela Stena magnesite pit in Serbia. These lacustrine deposits have mean delta(13)C((PDB)) values of similar to 4 and similar to 2 per mil and mean delta(18)O((SMOW)) values of similar to 36 and similar to 33 per mil, respectively, i.e., they both plot broadly over the atmospheric CO2-meteoric water field (end-member 1), consistent with microbially mediated precipitation at cool ground-water seepages in enclosed evaporating lakes.

To better understand the variation in microplastics in different seasons in an inland freshwater environment and determine the sources of microplastic pollution and its migration features, this study investigated the characteristics of microplastic pollution during dry (April) and wet (July) seasons in surface water of the Manas River Basin, China. The size, color, shape, area distribution and compound composition of microplastics were studied. Moreover, the risk of microplastic contamination was explored based on risk assessment models. The results demonstrated that the degree of pollution caused by microplastic abundance was minor in this study area. The average abundance of microplastics in April (17 +/- 4 items/L) was higher than that in July (14 +/- 2 items/L). The range in the abundance of microplastics in April and July were 22 +/- 5-14 +/- 3 items/L and 19 +/- 2-10 +/- 1 items/L, respectively. Highly hazardous polymers such as Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and Polycarbonate (PC) have a significant impact on the results of the evaluation of the presence of microplastics. This study is an important reference for understanding the characteristics of the seasonal variation in microplastics in inland freshwater environments and has practical significance, as it will allow relevant agencies to accurately assess the pollution level of microplastics in different seasons. It is of practical significance to understand the sources and sinks of microplastics in inland freshwater environment.

These two simultaneous and apparently contrasting processes can result in a negligible net effect on the sulfate concentration. Isotopic composition of sulfur in sulfate and sulfide can be applied to identify the bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR) though the extent of the process is difficult to quantify, Saturation with respect to gypsum may suggest that gypsum dissolution also occurs. However, a more definite identification of these processes and their quantification can be achieved through the use of ammonium concentration in the anoxic brines. This approach assumes that the ammonium is derived only from the oxidation of organic matter through BSR and it requires that the C:N ratio in the oxidized organic matter be known. A minimum estimate for the sulfate reduction can be obtained when the Redfield C:N ratio (106:16) is assumed. Several calculation methods are presented to identify the extent of sulfate reduction prior to, concomitant with, or following gypsum dissolution that are based on combining sulfur isotopic compositions, Rayleigh distillation equation, and calculated gypsum saturation indices. The required assumptions are presented and their validation is discussed. The subsurface hypersaline Ca-chloride brines in the vicinity of the Dead Sea are taken as a case study. Here sulfur isotope compositions of sulfate and sulfide, and high ammonium concentrations indicate BSR occurs in the subsurface. The sulfur isotopic composition of the sulfate makes it possible to distinguish between two major groups of brine and their recent evolutionary histories: (1) the Qedem-Shalem thermal brines (delta S-34(SO4) = 21-24 parts per thousand) which emerge as springs along the shores and are slightly undersaturated with respect to gypsum; (2) DSIF-Tappuah brines (delta S-34(SO4) = 30-60 parts per thousand) which are found in shallow boreholes and are saturated to oversaturated with respect to gypsum. Calculations based on their ammonium content suggest that both groups of brine require apparent unreasonably high oversaturations with respect to gypsum prior to the onset of the reduction. This implies that the groundwater systems were open with respect to sulfate, and that the sulfate reservoir was replenished continuously or intermittently during the BSR. The DSIF-Tappuah brines continue to dissolve gypsum during their BSR. The dissolving sulfate is derived from relatively isotopically enriched gypsums (delta S-34(SO4) > 20 parts per thousand), such as found in the Lisan Formation. These brines approach the steady-state isotopic composition (delta S-34(SS)) dictated by the combination of the delta S-34 of the dissolving gypsum and the fractionation factor accompanying BSR. The sulfur isotopic composition of the Qedem-Shalem brines implies that most of their ammonium content is derived from an earlier phase of BSR and that the last phase of BSR takes place during the brines' rapid ascent to the surface. Prior to this stage they evolved through either: (1) dissolution of gypsum with delta (34)S(SO4)less than or equal to 20 parts per thousand which occurred after the main BSR in the subsurface; (2) a previous phase in which the brines were part of a lake and later percolated to the subsurface. As such, their isotopic composition and ammonium content were determined by the combined effect of freshwater sulfate input to the lake and BSR in the stratified lake. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

PTE concentrations in sediment were ranked: Hg (0.05 +/- 0.01) < Cd (0.16 +/- 0.01) < Pb (9.34 +/- 1.42) < As (18.75 +/- 15.65) < Cu (63.30 +/- 15.17) < Ni (72.64 +/- 20.54) < Zn (86.66 +/- 11.95) < Cr (108.35 +/- 36.40) < Mn (1008 +/- 151) < Fe (53,998 +/- 6468), with no significant seasonal or spatial differences. Ecological risk indices (mHQ, EF, I-geo, CF, PLI, E-r(i), mCd, NPI, PERI, MPI, and TRI) showed low contamination levels. Health risk assessments, including LCR, HQ, and THI, indicated minimal risks to humans from sediment PTEs. Statistical analyses (PCA, HCA, SCC) identified natural, transportation, and anthropogenic PTE sources, with slight impacts from agriculture and fish farming. This research underlines contamination status of ADL and emphasizes the need for targeted management strategies, offering critical insights for environmental safeguarding.					; Tokatlı, Cem/AAN-3814-2021; Aydın, Handan/ABF-9679-2021; Muhammad, Said/AAD-4554-2021; Yüksel, Bayram/K-3701-2019; Yuksel, Bayram/K-3701-2019; Islam, Md/ABB-2487-2021; USTAOGLU, FIKRET/AAP-4558-2020; ustaoğlu, fikret/AAP-4558-2020	Aydin, Handan/0000-0002-1321-2120; Yuksel, Bayram/0000-0001-7686-8648; tokatli, cem/0000-0003-2080-7920; USTAOGLU, FIKRET/0000-0002-8195-8557; Islam, Md Saiful/0000-0002-3598-0315													0025-326X	1879-3363				JUN	2024	203								116488	10.1016/j.marpolbul.2024.116488	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2024.116488		MAY 2024						38759467					WOS:001243558200001

In arid zones, Cl profiles of the very deep unsaturated zone (reaching several hundred of metres) are used to reconstruct the evolution of precipitation. In arid zones where the unsaturated zone does not exceed about 20 m depth, and outside the spatially very limited infiltration zones, the net flow rises from the aquifer to the soil surface. Evaporation occurs close to the soil surface and chloride accumulates in the unsaturated zone. The quantity of Cl that is observed today in the unsaturated zone can be related to different periods of accumulation according to whether the depth of the phreatic level is assumed unchanged or not. In endhoreic catchments (with no outflow to the ocean), the lower extremity of the hydraulic system is generally a salty lake or even a salt crust. The quantity of chloride at this point is always noticeably less than the value corresponding to the net inflow of chloride over the period of its existence. Recent work shows that the principal mechanism responsible for this situation is flow to groundwater during periods of high lake level. The schematic functioning of these systems is: (a) infiltration of freshwater close to hinge line of the topography, (b) evaporation and accumulation of salt in the lower zone called the playa, and (c) free convection under the playa. Several modelling studies have focused on characterization of the free convection and on the position of the limit between freshwater and brines. The example of the aquifer of the central Bolivian Altiplano illustrates a case where this limit progressively moves towards the salt crust when the lake level falls. in an area of 3500 km situated in the upstream part of the catchment that includes the great salt crusts of Uyuni, the current groundwater chloride concentration varies there from 0.5 meq l(-1) upstream, to 150 meq l(-1) downstream. The transport of Cl in the aquifer, associated with its accumulation in the unsaturated zone, has been modelled over 11 000 years, In order to compute the evaporative outflow from the aquifer, a simple relationship between this flow and the depth of the water level below the soil surface has been established for all arid zones on the basis of isotopic profiles. The initial conditions of the transport simulation correspond to the moment of the withdrawal of the salty palaeo-lake Tauca that previously covered the area. Simulation takes into account the return of Cl accumulated in the unsaturated zone to the underlying aquifer, during the humid episodes around 2000 BP. Results of the modelling are compatible with the observed spatial evolution of the Cl concentration in the underground water and of the quantities of Cl accumulated in the unsaturated zone.					; Coudrain, Anne/HZI-1156-2023	RIBSTEIN, Pierre/0000-0002-1710-8267; 													0144-7815		1-901502-21-X				2000		262					409	416																WOS:000165501900060

Yet historical simulations have not been used to formally attribute changes in lake ice and temperature to anthropogenic drivers. In addition, future projections of these properties are limited to individual lakes or global simulations from single lake models. Here we uncover the human imprint on lakes worldwide using hindcasts and projections from five lake models. Reanalysed trends in lake temperature and ice cover in recent decades are extremely unlikely to be explained by pre-industrial climate variability alone. Ice-cover trends in reanalysis are consistent with lake model simulations under historical conditions, providing attribution of lake changes to anthropogenic climate change. Moreover, lake temperature, ice thickness and duration scale robustly with global mean air temperature across future climate scenarios (+0.9 degrees C degrees C-air(-1), -0.033 m degrees C-air(-1) and -9.7 d degrees C-air(-1), respectively). These impacts would profoundly alter the functioning of lake ecosystems and the services they provide. Anthropogenic climate change is impacting the temperature and ice cover of lakes across the globe, according to an attribution analysis based on hindcasts and projections from lake models.

J	Marengo, JA; Torres, RR; Alves, LM				Marengo, Jose A.; Torres, Roger Rodrigues; Alves, Lincoln Muniz			Drought in Northeast Brazil-past, present, and future	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												This study provides an overview of the drought situation in Northeast Brazil for the past, present, and future. Droughts affect more people than any other natural hazard owing to their large scale and long-lasting nature. They are recurrent in the region and while some measures have been taken by the governments to mitigate their impacts, there is still a perception that residents, mainly in rural areas, are not yet adapted to these hazards. The drought affecting the Northeast from 2012 to 2015, however, has had an intensity and impact not seen in several decades and has already destroyed large swaths of cropland, affecting hundreds of cities and towns across the region, and leaving ranchers struggling to feed and water cattle. Future climate projections for the area show large temperature increases and rainfall reductions, which, together with a tendency for longer periods with consecutive dry days, suggest the occurrence of more frequent/intense dry spells and droughts and a tendency toward aridification in the region. All these conditions lead to an increase in evaporation from reservoirs and lakes, affecting irrigation and agriculture as well as key water uses including hydropower and industry, and thus, the welfare of the residents. Integrating drought monitoring and seasonal forecasting provides efficient means of assessing impacts of climate variability and change, identifying vulnerabilities, and allowing for better adaptation measures not only for medium- and long-term climate change but also for extremes of the interannual climate variability, particularly droughts.

The purpose of this study was to review the studies conducted on the presence of antibiotics in water, sediments, and organisms in aquatic environments (i.e., seas, rivers, and lakes). Most of the reviewed studies were conducted in 2018 (15%) and 2014 (11%). Antibiotics were reported in aqueous media at a concentration of <1 ng/L-100 mu g/L. The results showed that the highest number of works were conducted in the Asian continent (seas: 74%, rivers: 78%, lakes: 87%, living organisms: 100%). The highest concentration of antibiotics in water and sea sediments, with a frequency of 49%, was related to fluoroquinolones. According to the results, the highest amounts of antibiotics in water and sediment were reported as 460 ng/L and 406 ng/g, respectively. In rivers, sulfonamides had the highest abundance (30%). Fluoroquinolones (with an abundance of 34%) had the highest concentration in lakes. Moreover, the highest concentration of fluoroquinolones in living organisms was reported at 68,000 ng/g, with a frequency of 39%. According to the obtained results, it can be concluded that sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones are among the most dangerous antibiotics due to their high concentrations in the environment. This review provides timely information regarding the presence of antibiotics in different aquatic environments, which can be helpful for estimating ecological risks, contamination levels, and their management.

J	Hao, ZC; Singh, VP; Xia, YL				Hao, Zengchao; Singh, Vijay P.; Xia, Youlong			Seasonal Drought Prediction: Advances, Challenges, and Future Prospects	REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS												Drought prediction is of critical importance to early warning for drought managements. This review provides a synthesis of drought prediction based on statistical, dynamical, and hybrid methods. Statistical drought prediction is achieved by modeling the relationship between drought indices of interest and a suite of potential predictors, including large-scale climate indices, local climate variables, and land initial conditions. Dynamical meteorological drought prediction relies on seasonal climate forecast from general circulation models (GCMs), which can be employed to drive hydrological models for agricultural and hydrological drought prediction with the predictability determined by both climate forcings and initial conditions. Challenges still exist in drought prediction at long lead time and under a changing environment resulting from natural and anthropogenic factors. Future research prospects to improve drought prediction include, but are not limited to, high-quality data assimilation, improved model development with key processes related to drought occurrence, optimal ensemble forecast to select or weight ensembles, and hybrid drought prediction to merge statistical and dynamical forecasts.					; SINGH, VIJAY/ACV-1417-2022	Singh, Vijay/0000-0003-1299-1457; 													8755-1209	1944-9208				MAR	2018	56	1					108	141		10.1002/2016RG000549	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016RG000549													WOS:000430130800004

An investigation was carried out to find the causes of this ecocatastrophe. During this investigation, certain biochemical parameters, i.e. the blood sugar level, the acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1.1.7), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, EC 1.1.2.3), glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT, EC 2.6.1.1), and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT, EC 2.6.1.2) activities in the blood serum of the collected surviving and dying eels were examined. Deltamethrin, the active ingredient of the insecticide K-OTHRIN 1 ULV, used against mosquitoes was detected in different animal species, i.e. eel, bream (Abramis brama), pike perch (Stizostedion lucioperca), and the common gull (Larus canus) and in sediment samples from the lake. Additionally, laboratory experiments were carried out to study the effects of deltamethrin on eels. During the investigation in the field it appeared that the AChE activity was significantly lower in the blood serum of the dying eels as compared to that in living animals (P < 0.05, Student's t-test). The blood glucose content exhibited a difference, too: it was 2.5 times higher in the dying eels than in the surviving ones. A huge increase in the LDH level was measured in the dying eels. The GOT activities of the serum were twice as high in the dying eels as in the living fish, while the GPT was not significantly changed. Deltamethrin was detected in different tissue samples of the dying eels: 2.70-18.1 mu g/kg in the liver, 9.0-31.1 mu g/kg in the gill and 3.0 mu g/kg wet tissue in the muscle. Deltamethrin residues were found in tissue samples from other animals, in the following concentrations: 0.44 mu g/kg in bream, 2.14 mu g/kg in pike perch and 1.06 mu g/kg wet tissue in dead gulls. The sediment samples collected from the sites of the devastation contained deltamethrin in a concentration of 5.50-30.00 mu g/kg wet sediment at the time of the eel deaths, and in a concentration 7.00-8.75 mu g/kg wet sediment a month later. Laboratory experiments with the insecticide K-OTHRIN 1 ULV revealed that 1.00 mu g/l of its active ingredient, deltamethrin, caused the death of 50% of the eels after an exposure time of 96 h. During this experiments similar trends could be observed in changes of enzyme activities of the treated eels to those that were detected in filed study during the eel devastation in Lake Balaton. At the end of a one-week treatment with the insecticide at the concentration of 0.5 mu g/l of its active ingredient the gills of the treated eels contained deltamethrin at 12.6-44.8 mu g/kg wet tissue concentration, while at the 24th hour after the treatment (11.2-42.7 mu g/kg wet tissue) deltamethrin concentration in the liver of treated eels could be detected.																			0236-5383						1999	50	1-3					161	173											10574437					WOS:000083232700015

We present a global compilation of quality-controlled, published, temperature-sensitive proxy records extending back 12,000 years through the Holocene. Data were compiled from 679 sites where time series cover at least 4000 years, are resolved at sub-millennial scale (median spacing of 400 years or finer) and have at least one age control point every 3000 years, with cut-off values slackened in data-sparse regions. The data derive from lake sediment (51%), marine sediment (31%), peat (11%), glacier ice (3%), and other natural archives. The database contains 1319 records, including 157 from the Southern Hemisphere. The multi-proxy database comprises paleotemperature time series based on ecological assemblages, as well as biophysical and geochemical indicators that reflect mean annual or seasonal temperatures, as encoded in the database. This database can be used to reconstruct the spatiotemporal evolution of Holocene temperature at global to regional scales, and is publicly available in Linked Paleo Data (LiPD) format.

Soil salinization is often characterized with significant spatiotemporal dynamics. The salt-affected soil is predominant in the Ebinur Lake region in the Northwestern China. However, detailed local soil salinity information is ambiguous at the best due to limited monitoring techniques. Nowadays, the availability of Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2, offers unprecedented perspectives for the monitoring and mapping of soil salinity. The use of MSI data is an innovative attempt for salinity detection in arid land. We hypothesize that field observations and MSI data and MSI data-derived spectral indices using the partial least square regression (PISA) approach will yield fairly accurate regional salinity map. Based on electrical conductivity of 1:5 soil:water extract (EC) of 72 ground-truth measurements (out of 116 sample sites) and various spectral parameters, such as satellite band reflectance, published satellite salinity indices, red-edge indices, newly constructed two-band indices, and three-band indices from MSI data, we built a few inversion models in an attempt to produce the regional salinity maps. Different algorithms including Pearson correlation coefficient method (PCC), variable importance in projection (VIP), Gray relational analysis (GRA), and random forest (RF) were applied for variable selection. The results suggest that both the newly proposed normalized difference index (NDI) [(B12 - B7) / (B12 + B7)] and three-band index (TBI4) [(B12 - B3) / (B3 - B11)] show a better correlation with validation data and could be applied to estimate the soil salinity in the Ebinur Lake region. The established models were validated using the remaining 44 independent ground-based measurements. The RF-PLSR model performed the best across the five models with R-V(2), RMSEv, and RPD of 0.92, 7.58 dS m(-1), and 2.36, respectively. The result from this model was then used to map the soil salinity over the study area. Our analyses suggest that soil salinization changes quite significantly in different seasons. Specifically, soil salinity in the dry season was higher than in the wet season, mostly in the lake area and nearby shores.

Recent studies have extended their focus from marine to inland waters, especially on the spatial-temporal distribution of the microplastics in urban rivers. In this study, Maozhou River, the largest river in Shenzhen, a tributary of the Pearl River, was selected as a representative inland waterway of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. The spatial-temporal investigation was performed on microplastics in the surface water and sediments of 17 sites along the mainstream of the Maozhou River. Results show that microplastics were widely and unevenly distributed along the river and reached the high abundances on the site most intensively surrounded by industries as well as the sites downstream. The abundances in dry season ranged from 4.0 +/- 1.0 to 25.5 +/- 3.5 items.L-1 in water and 35 +/- 15 to 560 +/- 70 item.kg(-1) in sediments, which were relatively higher than those observed in the wet season (water: 3.5 +/- 1.0 to 10.5 +/- 2.5 items.L-1; sediments: 25 +/- 5 to 360 +/- 90 item.kg(-1); p value < 0.05). The dominant types of the microplastics were identified as: PE Polyethylene (PE, water: 45.0%, sediments: 42.0%), polypropylene (PP, water and sediments: 12.5%), polystyrene (PS, water: 34.5%; sediments 14.5%) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC, water: 2.0%; sediments: 15%). Moreover, metals like Al, Si, Ca were discovered on the rough surface of the microplastics, indicating the interactions between the microplastics and the aquatic environment. Through a comprehensive comparison with other major inland waters in China, this work provides valuable data on the microplastics pollution of a representative inland water in the Greater Bay Area, and will further contribute to a better understanding on the land-based input of microplastics from the intensively affected inland waters.

J	BERON, LE				BERON, LE			FEATURES OF THE LIMNOLOGICAL BEHAVIOR OF SALTO GRANDES RESERVOIR (ARGENTINA URUGUAY)	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Salto Grande's reservoir (31-degrees-S 50-degrees-W) is a river-like reservoir of 780 km2 with multiple arms. The limnological behavior of the impoundment shows that excessive fertilization (eutrophication) in the lower half of the reservoir is of sufficient magnitude to cause impairment of beneficial use of recreational areas. The reservoir presents different subenvironments: several differentiated arms plus a main channel. The central zone has a high rate of water renewal, with physical and chemical characteristics similar to those of the Uruguay river before being dammed, except for suspended solids. The high variability of the system makes possible that the main channel sometimes behaves as a river, and at other times as a lake. These differences have a significant influence in phytoplankton development. Under normal or elevated-flow conditions, water travel time is such that less than the maximum possible algae develop near the dam, compared to the norm in other lakes and reservoirs; therefore of particular concern are the consequent low-flow conditions. These conditions increase the time for algae development in the reservoir, and more importantly, allow for the sedimentation of inorganic turbidity, which under most conditions limits available light reducing algal growth below what normally occurs in waterbodies. This characterization as a 'hybrid' lake is confirmed by the differences in algal development, which reaches its maximum expression in the Gualeguaycito arm, and is not explained by differences in nutrient concentrations. At the same time some physical factors operate with unequal intensity in both systems. While in the lateral arms lentic conditions prevail, in the main channel the intensity of the turbulence and the horizontal transport establish lotic conditions. The nutrient conditions of the water characterize this reservoir as mesotrophic, and even sometimes eutrophic, which indicates that the nutrients are not the limiting factor in phytoplankton development. This fact has been confirmed by blue-green algae blooms that occurred during March and April of 1980 and 1982. Dissolved oxygen concentration is acceptable in the lake, albeit showing a tendency to decrease towards the bottom, especially in the lateral arms, and presenting the minimum values in summer. The relationship between Secchi depth and the hydraulic residence time clearly shows that, when the water is slow, the turbidity decreases, Secchi-depth measurements increase and, therefore, more algal growth takes place. The reservoir may be considered as a system composed of two markedly different subsystems regarding their biological manifestations: the system of lateral arms where the phytoplankton is exclusively dominated by Cyanophyceae, particularly Microcystis sp., and the main channel characterized by diatomous algae, with absolute dominance of Melosira sp. The evolution of algae concentrations and species, of chlorophyll-a concentrations, and of some physico-chemical parameters, emphasize the unequal behavior of both subsystems, which implies the development and persistence of different environmental conditions. Our results indicate that the phytoplankton of the reservoir is limited by the inorganic turbidity, except at the end of the arms, and is mainly determined by water renewal in the center of the reservoir and by the washing effect due to rainfall on the lateral arms.																			0304-3800					NOV	1990	52	1-2					87	102		10.1016/0304-3800(90)90010-E	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800(90)90010-E													WOS:A1990EU09300009

As part of the Salt Lake regional Smoke, Ozone and Aerosol Study (SAMOZA), 35 VOCs were measured with two methods: a proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS) and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) cartridges analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Over two months, the total measured VOCs averaged 32 +/- 24 ppb (mean +/- standard deviation) with the hourly maximum at 141 ppb, and the total calculated OH reactivity averaged 3.7 +/- 3.0 s-1 (maximum at 20.7 s-1). Among them, methanol and ethanol were the most abundant VOCs, making up 42% of the ambient mixing ratio. Isoprene and monoterpenes contributed 25% of the OH reactivity from VOCs, while formaldehyde and acetaldehyde made up another 30%. The positive matrix factorization analysis showed 5 major sources of VOCs, with 32% of abundance being attributed to secondary production/biogenic sources, 44% from the combination of traffic and personal care products, 15% from industrial solvent use, and the rest from biomass burning (10%). Moderate smoke-impacted days elevated various hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) on average by 45%-217% compared to smoke-free days. The ratio of OH reactivity from NOx to that from VOCs showed that ozone production was mostly VOC-limited throughout the campaign, consistent with our modeling study. VOCs and NOx both showed increased OH reactivity due to smoke influence. NOx featured increased reactivity on weekdays compared to weekends, an effect not shown for VOC reactivity during SAMOZA. Salt Lake City, Utah has higher concentrations of ozone, a pollutant harmful to human and plant life, in the atmosphere than the standard set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). The reasons for the high levels of ozone remain uncertain. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a class of air pollutants that undergo reactions that produce ozone. Understanding their sources and reactions is important to be able to reduce air pollution. In this study, we measured 35 VOCs in SLC in August and September 2022 and used a model to identify their major sources. Concentrations of hazardous VOCs identified by the US EPA increased by 45%-217% when wildfire smoke was present in the air. Methanol and ethanol were the most important VOCs in terms of total concentration in the air, while isoprene and monoterpenes were the most important in terms of reactions that could create ozone. According to the model results, VOCs are emitted from five major sources including traffic and solvent use. Further measurements are needed to confirm the model results and reduce uncertainty of the important sources of VOCS. Methanol and ethanol dominated the total measured VOC abundance while isoprene dominated total OH reactivity from volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in Salt Lake City Traffic and solvent use are roughly equivalent contributors to anthropogenic VOC emissions in Salt Lake City during SAMOZA Ozone production was limited by VOCs in Salt Lake City in summer 2022					Hu, Lu/O-9959-2017; Jin, Lixu/JUU-5709-2023; Jones, Colleen/LIG-2448-2024	Hu, Lu/0000-0002-4892-454X; Tan, Lu/0009-0004-6009-6304; Ketcherside, Damien/0000-0002-2149-9133													2169-897X	2169-8996				SEP 16	2024	129	17							e2024JD041640	10.1029/2024JD041640	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024JD041640													WOS:001309144400001
J	Douglas, MR; Brunner, PC				Douglas, MR; Brunner, PC			Biodiversity of Central Alpine Coregonus (Salmoniformes):: Impact of one-hundred years of management	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Coregonus has been under intense management in the Central Alpine Yet-lion of Europe for more than 100 yr. To assess how this management has affected local populations, extant patterns of genotypic and phenotypic diversity were examined within a taxonomic frame-work to identify indigenous and introduced populations, and to provide a perspective on future management based on true conservation units. Thirty-three Coregonus populations from 17 selected Central Alpine lakes were classified as indigenous, introduced, or uncertain (i.e., status or origin unknown). Using genetic data across six microsatellite DNA loci, individuals of the 19 indigenous populations could be correctly allocated to population with 71% probability in a nonparametric discriminant analysis. The same individuals could be allocated to population with 69% probability using five meristic counts, and but 44% probability using four fin-pigmentation characteristics. Discriminating ability was enhanced to 91% when both meristic and color data were coalesced, and composite use of genetic and phenotypic data provided an average discrimination probability of 79%. Capabilities of the various data sets decreased when applied separately to allocate specimens according to either lake (n = 8) or lake-aggregate (n = 5). Genetic data were then statistically contrasted against four taxonomic hierarchies: Kottelatt's species arrangement, and Steinmann's depiction of "ecotype," "natio," and a combination of the two. Genetic data were statistically congruent with Kottelat's depiction of species, and with Steinmann's arrangement of populations into natio (or regions). Results support arguments that indigenous populations of Central Alpine Coregonus are distinct, with closest relations within lakes (or lake aggregates). Their evolutionary origin is best described using a species-flock model. Genetic data for 19 indigenous populations were combined with those for 14 populations either introduced or of unknown provenance. Pairwise comparisons of allele and genotype frequencies demonstrated significant genetic differences among populations, supporting uniqueness of rare forms, such as "alpenrheinfelchen" of Lake Konstanz or "winter-brienzlig" of Lake Brienz, but also revealed genetic divergence of introduced populations from their alleged source. Introduced populations clustered within the group containing their population of origin but did not associate directly with their source, thus indicating post-introduction genetic divergence. These findings were most remarkable for "balchen" of Lake Ageri and "palee" from Lake Geneve (stocked from lakes Zug and Geneve, respectively). Also, "sempacherbalchen" of Lake Sempach was significantly distinct from all other populations, even though it was supposedly stocked "from every lake and into every lake." It also clustered with populations in geographic proximity, suggesting that it may still retain historic endemicity. Finally, "lavarello" and "nuova forma" from Lake Maggiore did not group as expected with forms from Lake Konstanz or lakes Neuchatel/Bienne, but instead with those from Lake Zug. Nonparametric discriminant analyses over 32 populations, again employing genotypic and phenotypic data, confirmed divergence of introduced populations and clarified status for populations of uncertain origin. Results of analyses also confirmed that historic signatures still persist in extant populations. However, several examples also demonstrate that indiscriminant and undocumented stocking, in the Central Alpine region during the last 100 yr has simply added to the confusion already extant from naturally occurring cryptic and sibling species within these lakes. Thus, until species descriptions are forthcoming for all forms, the Central Alpine Coregonus lineage should be viewed as an "evolutionarily significant unit" (ESU), and each population a specific "management unit" (MU) within that lineage.

J	Wang, JL; Fu, ZS; Qiao, HX; Liu, FX				Wang, Junli; Fu, Zishi; Qiao, Hongxia; Liu, Fuxing			Assessment of eutrophication and water quality in the estuarine area of Lake Wuli, Lake Taihu, China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Our study assessed the actual water situation in the estuarine area of Lake Wuli, Meiliang Bay, Lake Taihu, China, based on eutrophication levels and status of water quality using the trophic level index (TLI) and water quality index (WQI) methods. In the wet (August 2017) and dry (March 2018) seasons, 22 estuarine areas were tested at 69 sampling sites, which included lake and rivers. Five parameters-chlorophyll a (Chl-a), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), Secchi disk (SD) and permanganate index (CODMn)-were measured to calculate the TLI, and 15 parameters-temperature (T), pH, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), total dissolved solids (TDS), TN, TP, ammonium (NH4-N), nitrate (NO3-N), nitrite (NO2-N), CODMn, calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), chloride (Cl-) and phosphate (PO4-P)-were measured to calculate the WQI. The average TLI and WQI values in the wet season were 61.69 and 60.70, respectively, and the eutrophication level and water quality status were worse than that in the dry season (TLI: 57.40, WQI: 65.74). Significant differences were observed between three parts of Lake Wuli(West, Middle and East). Regardless of wet or dry season, East Wuli had worse eutrophication levels and water quality status than the other parts, whereas West Wuli showed less severe levels. DO, TN and CODMn used in the minimum WQI (WQI(min)) were the most effective parameters in our study. WQI(min) had stricter standards than WQI when analyzing water quality in the estuarine area of Wulihu. Factor analysis from principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that N might be the main factor affecting water quality of the most eastern sites in the wet season, and P may be the main factor in the dry season. Our results provide a valuable contribution to inform decision-making for the management of water environments by providing the actual water situation of the estuarine area of Lake Wuli.

In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal dynamic of microplastics in a typical urban river network in eastern China from December 2018 to September 2019. microplastics abundance (mean +/- standard deviation) in the river network ranged from 2.3 +/- 1.2 to 104.6 +/- 5.6 particles/L and was significantly higher during the wet than during the dry season. The distribution of microplastics in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the river network did not significantly differ, nor did the abundance of microplastics in the surface water vs. the bottom water. However, high abundances were determined in commercial and industrial areas, at a wastewater treatment plant outlet, in an urban canal, and in an urban-rural fringe area. The seasonal dynamics of the overall abundance of microplastics could be explained by the hysteresis effect of urban plastic production and the variation in regional precipitation. 78.2% of the microplastics were < 330 mu m in size; the most common colors were blue and black, and the most common shapes were fragments and fibers. The polymer types of the microplastics were assessed using laser direct infrared (LDIR), a novel chemical imaging system that identified silicone, rubber, polytetrafluoroethylene, and polypropylene as the main components of the microplastics. A non metric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) based on the abundance of the polymer components across samples showed aggregations of sampling sites, that indicated the possible sources of the microplastics. Our study provides insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of microplastics in an urban river network and suggests the potential of LDIR in the accurate quantitative analysis of microplastics in the environment.

Observations were made by the Akebono (EXOS D) satellite at altitudes of about 10,000 km on several successive orbits on February 7, 1990, when the magnetic activity was high (Kp = approximately 4) and a series of substorms took place. Combining the particle and the electric field measurements, height-latitude structures of electric potentials relevant to premidnight discrete auroras are derived. The UV images of aurora are used to monitor the structure of precipitating electrons at the ionospheric heights. A large-scale minimum of electric potential, where the convection velocity rotates clockwise, corresponded to a discrete aurora that delineated the poleward limit of auroras recorded by the Akebono UV imager. The poleward boundary of the plasma sheet, identified by the particle measurements, did not coincide with this clockwise rotation, and was located at a few degrees further poleward. A weaker but distinct potential maximum associated with a counterclockwise rotation of the flow was observed in the boundary region of the plasma sheet where accelerated electrons with intense lower-energy (E<1keV) populations were present, but their energy flux at the ionospheric heights is too low (<1erg s-1 cm-2 sr-1) to produce bright auroras. Upward flowing ion (UFI) conics and sometimes approximately 10-keV ions with a clear dispersion (where energy fell down toward lower latitudes) were observed in this boundary region of the plasma sheet. Thus the upward field-aligned electric field should exist above the satellite level, and no significant acceleration took place below it. In the region of the potential minimum and the clockwise rotation, accelerated electrons were observed which had a ''hole'' distribution (characterized by the absence in the low - energy component), and UFI beams were also seen. This indicates that the upward field-aligned electric field existed both above and below the satellite. Because of this electric field the energy flux of the electrons became high enough to produce the discrete aurora. These observational facts suggest that electric potentials in the premidnight auroral zone am more structured in heights and latitudes during sub storms. That is, in the boundary region of the plasma sheet (the region of potential maximum) the field-aligned acceleration Lakes place at the higher altitudes. On the lower-latitude side (the region of potential minimum), the acceleration occurs at both the higher and the lower altitudes. The latter corresponds to the region of maximum auroral intensity. In the boundary region of the plasma sheet, the magnetospheric electrons are accelerated by the higher-altitude electric field only, and would be mostly reflected back by the magnetic mirror force. On the other hand, the electrons in the lower latitudes are further accelerated at the lower altitudes and could sufficiently account for bright auroral emissions. Thus the most poleward discrete aurora does not necessarily project to the plasma sheet boundary layer (PSBL), and could be situated significantly closer to Earth than previously expected.

However, they are damaged by dam construction all over the world. Many studies have been conducted on the effects of dam construction on biodiversity, but a review about it is missing. The objectives of this review are: (1) to discuss the effects of dam construction on biodiversity in freshwater wetlands; and (2) to identify the future directions for research in this field. To achieve these objectives, 347 significant publications from 2000 to 2017 were selected (based on a rigorous screening processes and a systematic literature review approach) from the ISI Web of Knowledge database. Dam construction decreased the water fungal biomass and richness in reservoirs and downstream reaches, but increased the amount of soil microorganisms in downstream lake wetlands. The studies about effects of dam on benthos mainly focused on macroinvertebrate, periphyton and mussel. Most studies about the effects on macroinvertebrate claimed that dam construction caused increases in biomass and decreases in taxa richness in downstream reaches. The studies about effects of dam on plankton mainly focused on phytoplankton, zooplankton, planktonic microorganisms and ichthyoplankton. Effects of dam on fish (including aquatic mammals) included blocking migration route, habitat fragmentation, changing from lotic to lentic water in the impounded area, release of hypolimnetic cold water of reservoir, and changes of water flow in downstream reaches. Studies about effects of dam construction on botany mainly focused on the riparian plants, but there were few studies on floating plants and submerged macrophyte and effects of dam construction on botany in downstream lake wetlands. There were only few studies that examined these effects of dam on bird. We also pointed out the future directions for research in this field. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Hecht, JS; Lacombe, G; Arias, ME; Dang, TD; Piman, T				Hecht, Jory S.; Lacombe, Guillaume; Arias, Mauricio E.; Thanh Duc Dang; Piman, Thanapon			Hydropower dams of the Mekong River basin: A review of their hydrological impacts	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Hydropower production is altering the Mekong River basin's riverine ecosystems, which contain the world's largest inland fishery and provide food security and livelihoods to millions of people. The basin's hydropower reservoir storage, which may rise from similar to 2% of its mean annual flow in 2008 to similar to 20% in 2025, is attenuating seasonal flow variability downstream of many dams with integral powerhouses and large storage reservoirs. In addition, tributary diversions for off-stream energy production are reducing downstream flows and augmenting them in recipient tributaries. To help manage tradeoffs between dam benefits (hydropower, irrigation, flood control, domestic water supply, and navigation) and their consequences for livelihoods and ecosystems, we review observed and projected impacts on river flows along both the Mekong mainstream and its tributaries. We include the effects of diversions and inter-basin transfers, which prior reviews of flow alteration in the Mekong basin have largely neglected. We also discuss the extent to which concurrent changes in climate, water demand, and land use, may offset or exacerbate hydropower-induced flow alteration. Our major recommendations for assessing hydrological impacts in the Mekong and other basins undergoing rapid hydropower development include synchronizing and integrating observational and modeling studies, improving the accuracy of reservoir water balances, evaluating multi-objective reservoir operating rules, examining hydropeaking-induced flow alteration, conducting multi-dam safety assessments, evaluating flow indicators relevant to local ecosystems and livelihoods, and considering alternative energy sources and reservoir sedimentation in long-term projections. Finally, we strongly recommend that dam impact studies consider hydrological alteration in conjunction with fish passage barriers, geomorphic changes and other contemporaneous stressors.

J	Riding, R				Riding, R			Structure and composition of organic reefs and carbonate mud mounds: concepts and categories	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Defined here as 'essentially in place calcareous deposits created by sessile organisms', Organic Reefs are diverse and complex structures with a long geological history. Their classification has been the subject of fierce debate, often characterized by reliance on subjective features such as wave-resistance and qualitative attempts to discriminate between 'first' and 'second class' reefs. In contrast, emphasis is here placed on the objective characteristic of the type of sedimentary support, which largely determines the sedimentary composition of the deposit. Constructional and depositional processes result in three principal sedimentary components: matrix (M), essentially in place skeletons (S) and cavityleement (C), whose proportions can be represented on MSC triangular plots. Separately or together, these components also provide the structural support for the reef. On these compositional and structural bases, three main categories of Organic Reef are recognized: (1) Matrix-supported reefs (Agglutinated Microbial Reefs, Cluster Reefs, Segment Reefs), (2) Skeleton-supported reefs (Frame Reefs), (3) Cement-supported reefs (Cement Reefs). Agglutinated Microbial Reefs: possess laminated, clotted, or aphanitic fabrics created by microbial trapping of particulate sediment; in place skeletons and large primary cavities are rare; early cementation may provide added support; topographic relief is limited by the need for currents to provide sediment to accreting surfaces. Cluster Reefs: skeletal reefs in which essentially in place skeletons are adjacent, but not in contact, resulting in matrix support; characterized by relatively high matrix/skeleton ratios and low volumes of extra-skeletal early cement. Sediment trapping is an important corollary of skeletal growth and Cluster Reef organisms are tolerant of loose sediment. Absence of framework limits the topographic relief that Cluster Reefs can attain relative to spatial extent, and may permit bedding to develop within the reef. Close Cluster Reefs have skeletons up to I unit-distance apart. Spaced Cluster Reefs have skeletons more than 1, and up to 2 unit-distances apart; with increasing separation of skeletons they grade to level-bottom communities. Segment Reefs: matrix-supported reefs in which skeletons are adjacent, and may be in contact, but are mostly disarticulated and mainly parauthochtonous. Matrix abundance is high, and early cement relatively low. Moderate relief can develop in response to intense on-reef sediment production. Frame Reefs: skeletal reefs in which essentially in place skeletons (including calcified microbes) are in contact; characterized by relatively high skeleton/matrix ratio. Skeletal support enables them to raise themselves above the substrate independently of cementation and particulate sedimentation. Simultaneously, by creating partly open shelter cavities, skeletal support may facilitate early cementation. Both relief and early lithification promote marginal talus formation. Skeletal shape and orientation distinguish: conical/stick-like, dendritic, domical, and laminar frames. Each of these may be open or filled. Open Frame Reefs: cavities remain open during the early stages of reef growth and are occupied by cryptic encrusters, early cements and internal sediment; exposed skeleton encourages endoliths. Filled Frame Reefs: inter-skeletal spaces penecontemporaneously occluded by surficial sediment during reef-growth. Cement Reel, : reefs created by cementation of essentially in place organisms. Cement provides strength and volume, mimicking skeletal growth, and can form on non-skeletal as well as skeletonized organisms. Non-skeletal Cement Reefs : created by synsedimentary cementation of essentially in place non-skeletal organisms. This converts a soft deposit with relatively poor preservation potential into it rigid lithified mass: e.g., Tufa Cement Reefs (phytoherms) in rivers and lakes and Possibly travertine Cement Reefs associated with hot springs. If the organisms are skeletal, synsedimentary cementation imparts extra strength and stability to what otherwise would be a Cluster or Frame Reef, and results in Skeleton-Cement Reef.. Cement Reefs exhibit complex relationships between cement, matrix and skeletons. Agglutinated Microbial, Cluster and Segment reefs tend to be structurally simple, have low primary relief, and may show bedding. Frame (including microbial Microframe) and Cement Reefs tend to be unbedded, structurally complex, and can have high relief. Carbonate Mud Mounds: carbonate mud-dominated deposits with topographic relief and few or no stromatolites, thrombolites or in place skeletons. Low, Relief Carbonate Mud Mounds are typically thin. High Relief Carbonate Mud Mounds are thick, and internal bedding, slumping, stromatactis cavity systems, and steep marginal slopes may be common. Whereas Organic Reel's are biogenic, calcareous, and are created by essentially in place organisms, Carbonate Mud Mounds can be organic and/or inorganic in origin and it can be difficult to distinguish their origins.

However, it remains unknown how global change affects CO2 emissions over longer time scales. Here, we present seasonal and annual fluxes of CO2 emissions from streams, rivers, lakes, and reservoirs throughout China and quantify their changes over the past three decades. We found that the CO2 emissions declined from 13831 Tg C yr(-1) in the 1980s to 98 +/- 19 Tg C yr(-1) in the 2010s. Our results suggest that this unexpected decrease was driven by a combination of environmental alterations, including massive conversion of free-flowing rivers to reservoirs and widespread implementation of reforestation programs. Meanwhile, we found increasing CO2 emissions from the Tibetan Plateau inland waters, likely attributable to increased terrestrial deliveries of organic carbon and expanded surface area due to climate change. We suggest that the CO2 emissions from Chinese inland waters have greatly offset the terrestrial carbon sink and are therefore a key component of China's carbon budget. Inland waters emit greenhouse gases, but robust estimations are hampered by a dearth of spatio-temporally resolved measurements. Here the authors present annual fluxes of CO2 from Chinese inland waters over the past several decades, showing that emission fluxes have significantly declined since the 80s.

J	Kosheleva, N; Efimova, L; Efimov, V; Sycheva, D				Kosheleva, Natalia; Efimova, Liudmila; Efimov, Vasilii; Sycheva, Daria			Potentially toxic elements in the Gusinoye Lake (Republic of Buryatia, Russia)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Enterprises of fuel and energy complex are the main sources of carcinogenic and mutagenic potentially toxic elements (PTEs). Their particulate and gaseous emissions, wastes, and effluents enforce migration processes of PTEs in atmosphere, soil, and then in water bodies, creating a danger to the functioning of aquatic ecosystems. Vulnerable objects include water bodies with slow water exchange, due to the accumulation of PTEs in the bottom sediments and the threat of secondary contamination. Among them it is necessary to note cooling ponds of thermal power plants (TPP). In this study, the ecological and geochemical state of components of "water-suspended sediments-bottom sediments" aquatic system is assessed on the example of the Gusinoye Lake (the Republic of Buryatia), which is used as cooling pond for the largest in the region TPP, burning brown coal from local deposits. The Gusinoye Lake is the second largest lake in Buryatia after the Baikal Lake and a valuable source of water supply, place of recreation, and fish breeding. To study the distribution of PTEs in the waters of the lake, a network of 19 monitoring stations was deployed in the summer of 2019. In contrast to the previous researches, detailed studies of the central deep-water part of the lake were carried out. As a result, data on the concentration of PTEs in the dissolved and suspended forms and also in bottom sediments was obtained. To study the balance of chemicals in the lake, its main tributaries were surveyed, as well as the drainage channel of TPP. For the first time, for the Lake Gusinoye, bulk concentrations of As, Cd, Pb, Zn, Co, Mo, Cu, Sb, Cr, V, Mn, Sr, and Ag were determined using the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The highest concentrations of dissolved PTEs in the lake water are confined to the mouths of tributaries in the northern part of the lake. Dissolved Sr, Mo, and Cu in the lake exceed maximum permissible concentrations (MPCs) for fishery. The maximum concentrations of Sr and Cu are almost 3 MPCs and that of Mo is 22 MPCs near the TPP. The suspended sediments of the Gusinoye Lake are depleted of all studied PTEs as compared to the regional clarkes (natural abundances) of the lithosphere. Mn has the highest concentrations in the suspension, and its maximum concentration was due to the surface runoff from the solid waste landfill and an abandoned coal mine. Concentrations of Cu, Zn, Sr, Mo, and Pb in bottom sediments are higher than in suspended sediments, thus indicating the accumulation of pollutants. The maximum intensity of accumulation is characteristic of the deep central basin of the lake and its eastern part, where Sr, Ag, and Mo accumulate most intensively near the coal field. The main sources of PTE pollution are concentrated in the northern and northeastern parts of the lake catchment area. Significant amount of dissolved Mo, Sr, and As enter the lake with the waters of quarries and mines of the coal fields, the solid waste landfill of the town of Gusinoozyorsk, and northern rivers-tributaries, draining the dumps of the large Zagustaj coal field.					; Kosheleva, Natalia/M-7040-2015; Efimov, Vasiliy/C-4485-2016; Ефимова, Людмила/HKW-8495-2023; Сычева, Дарья/HGA-1759-2022	, Vasiliy/0000-0001-9231-4493; Sycheva, Daria/0000-0001-8952-5820; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				NOV	2022	29	51					77593	77608		10.1007/s11356-022-18848-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-18848-1		JUN 2022						35680743					WOS:000808436200005

Multi-spectral remote sensing (RS) data including Landsat series provides the potential for frequent surveys for soil salinization at various scales and resolutions. Additionally, the recently launched Sentinel-2 satellite constellation has temporal revisiting frequency of 5 days, which has been proven to be an ideal approach to assess soil salinity. Yet, studies on detailed comparison in soil salinity tracking between Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI remain limited. For this purpose, we collected a total of 64 topsoil samples in an arid desert region, the Ebinur Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve (ELWNNR) to compare the monitoring accuracy between Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI. In this study, the Cubist model was trained using RS-derived covariates (spectral bands, Tasseled Cap transformation-derived wetness (TCW), and satellite salinity indices) and laboratory measured electrical conductivity of 1:5 soil:water extract (EC). The results showed that the measured soil salinity had a significant correlation with surface soil moisture (Pearson's r = 0.75). The introduction of TCW generated satisfactory estimating performance. Compared with OLI dataset, the combination of MSI dataset and Cubist model yielded overall better model performance and accuracy measures (R-2 = 0.912, RMSE = 6.462 dS m(-1), NRMSE = 9.226%, RPD = 3.400 and RPIQ = 6.824, respectively). The differences between Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI were distinguishable. In conclusion, MSI image with finer spatial resolution performed better than OLI. Combining RS data sets and their derived TCW within a Cubist framework yielded accurate regional salinity map. The increased temporal revisiting frequency and spectral resolution of MSI data are expected to be positive enhancements to the acquisition of high-quality soil salinity information of desert soils.

The current study aims at analyzing the hydrological consequences of dynamic LULC changes in the Anzali wetland catchment, Iran. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT 2012) model was used to assess impacts on evapotranspiration, water yield, and sediment yield. Two model runs were performed using static and dynamic LULC inputs to evaluate the effects of LULC change between 1990 and 2013. For the static model, the LULC map of 1990 was used, whereas for the dynamic model, a gradual change of the LULC distribution was interpolated from 1990, 2000, and 2013 LULC data. The major LULC changes were identified as an increase of agricultural area by 7% of the catchment area and a decrease of forest coverage by 6.8% between 1990 and 2013. At the catchment scale, the differences in the long-term mean annual values for the main water balance components and sediment yield were smaller than 10111111 (-2.8%) and 3 t/m(2) (<2.6%), respectively. However, at the sub-basin scale the increase of agricultural land use resulted in an increase of evapotranspiration, water yield, and sediment yield by up to 83%, 7%, and 169%, respectively, whereas urban expansion led to a decrease of evapotranspiration, water yield, and sediment yield by up to -3.5%, -2.3%, and -9.4%. According to the results of the monthly time scale analysis, the most significant impact of LULC changes occurs during the dry season months, when the increase of irrigation agriculture results in an increase in water discharge and sediment loads to the Anzali wetland. Overall, the results showed that the implementation of dynamic LULC change into the SWAT model could be adopted as a planning tool to manage LULC change of the Anzali wetland catchment in the future.

LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE OF THE TERRITORY OF THE PEATLAND OF INTERNATIONAL IMPORTANCE "KAMSKO-BAKALDINSKAYA GROUP OF MIRES"	GEOSFERNYE ISSLEDOVANIYA-GEOSPHERE RESEARCH												The article presents the results of landscape division of the territory of the largest Ramsar wetland of international significance in the Volga River basin "Kamsko-Bakaldinskaya group of mires". The researched territory is located in the center of the Russian Plain in the east of the Nizhny Novgorod region in the zone of mixed coniferous-deciduous forests on the above the floodplain terraces of the Volga River valley. The Kamsko-Bakaldinskaya group of mires has a high natural conservation value, performing environmental-forming functions, contributing to the preservation of the genofund and the cenofund. The mire massif acts as a regulator of the hydrological regime of the Volga River and a number of its tributaries; like other mires, it is a natural filter, which helps to purify water, and a carbon deposit zone. For effective planning of environmental protection measures and a deep - systemic - understanding of the processes and spatial patterns of the placement of objects of the plant and animal world, a landscape zoning scheme of the territory, made at the landscape level, is necessary. The researched territory is a complex of geotopes from high above-floodplain terraces to the left-bank and island floodplain of the largest river in Europe - the Volga river, which in itself is a factor of landscape diversity. The lithogenic base is mainly represented by fluvio-glacial sands and peat. The aeolian relief forms - dunes, which, entering the mire massifs, form dry manes, are confined to the areas of sands within the high above-floodplain terraces. Local low-lying mires are associated with deflation basins. The hydrographic network is represented by rivers - big (Volga), medium (Kerzhenets) and small rivers and streams. The territory, due to poor drainage, is rich in mires (there are mires of all types) and lakes, including the largest lake in the Nizhny Novgorod region - Bolshoe Plotovo, and the deepest lake of the region-Shumskoye. The lakes are represented by several genetic groups, including paleo-thermokarstic lakes, lakes of maituga origin and oxbow-lakes. Despite the low-lying and relatively calm relief and the high level of bog formation swamping, there is one spring within the researched territory - the Kulteiskiy Source. The soil cover is dominated by sod-podzolic sandy and peat-bog soils. The vegetation is mainly represented by pine forests on the sands and vegetation complexes of mires on a peat substrate. During the research in the period from 2006 to 2021, a map of the landscapes of the Kamsko-Bakaldinskaya group of mires was drawn. Making this map, we relied on data from thematic maps, literary sources, data from remote sensing of the Earth and materials of our own field research, during which complex descriptions were done at key points. The obtained results can be used in planning and conducting scientific, environmental, educational and economic activities on the territory of the Kamsko-Bakaldinskaya group of mires.																			2542-1379	2541-9943				JUN	2023		2					142	154		10.17223/25421379/27/10	http://dx.doi.org/10.17223/25421379/27/10													WOS:001118599400010

However, the lack of a high-resolution stratigraphy and high-precision geochronology of these sediments has limited our understanding of the mechanisms of Quaternary climatic and environmental changes in the region. In this study, we present a high-resolution magnetic susceptibility stratigraphy and precise paleomagnetic and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) chronologies for core Qiananlingzi (QAL) from the Northeast Plain. Paleomagnetic data were obtained using alternating-field (AF) demagnetization with a peak AF of 80 mT and increments of 2.5-10 mT. In addition, OSL dating was conducted on coarse-grained quartz (90-150 mu m) using the single aliquot regenerative dose (SAR) protocol. Correlation of the recognized polarity intervals of the QAL core to the geomagnetic polarity timescale was achieved by combining the magnetostratigraphic and OSL geochronologic data. The results indicate that the sedimentary sequence spans the interval from the Olduvai normal subchron to the end of the Brunhes normal chron. According to the lithology and the magnetic susceptibility record, the core can be divided into four intervals, from bottom to top: the Qian'an Formation (fluvial yellow-green, brown-red and grey-brown silty sand, interbedded with brown-black silty clay, with gravel layers in the lower part); the Lingzi Formation and Lindian Formation (lacustrine grey-green clay interbedded with grey-white silty sand, with fossil bivalves); and a loess-like soil (predominantly brown-yellow clayey silt, alternating with fluviolacustrine greywhite, brown and black clay). The magnetic susceptibilities (MS) of the sediments of the lower fluvial Qian'an Formation and upper loess-like soil strata are generally higher, indicating the neoformation of strongly magnetic minerals under predominantly oxidizing conditions. By contrast, lower MS values occur in the lacustrine sediments of the Lingzi Formation and Lindian Formation, which indicate a reducing environment. Overall, the MS record of the QAL core exhibits clear orbital-scale variations, with higher MS values in coarse-grained silt layers, and lower values in fine-grained clay layers. After the application of a 300 mT DC field, the isothermal remanence (IRM) is only 70%, and a hysteresis loop remained unclosed at 500 mT. These characteristics indicate the substantial presence of high-coercivity magnetic minerals in the intervals with low MS values. Thermomagnetic measurements (chi-T) curves show an abrupt decrease in the heating curve at 580 degrees C, indicating that magnetite is the dominant magnetic mineral, and a further decrease above 580 degrees C indicates the presence of hematite. After the application of an applied DC field of 300 mT, the IRM reached 90%, the hysteresis loop was closed, and the heating limb of the chi-T curve did not decrease significantly after 580 degrees C, indicating that low-coercivity magnetic minerals contributed substantially to the magnetic properties within the intervals of higher MS. The lacustrine sediments of the core were dated to similar to 1180-450 ka based on paleomagnetic and QSL dating, and interpolation of the age-depth relationship suggests that Songnen paleo-lake existed for similar to 730 ka. The grain-size record of the loess in the northeastern monsoon region shows no evidence of drought events at 450 ka, and records of MS and FeD/FeT from the deposits of the loess Plateau indicate a trend of increasing summer monsoon precipitation at this time. Therefore, the disappearance of the paleo-lake may be related to the multiple episodes of subsidence of the Yishu fault, which caused a diversion of the discharge of the Songhua River from the Songnen paleo-lake to the Sanjiang Plain. The high-resolution MS record and the precise chronology obtained in this study indicate that the lacustrine sedimentary sequence of QAL core can potentially resolve orbital-scale paleoclimate changes during the middle Pleistocene in mid-latitude East Asia. The Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT) is one of the most important climatic events in Quaternary paleoclimatology, and it is necessary to understand the response of different climatic systems to the MPT. Detailed environmental magnetic, sedimentological and geochemical studies of lacustrine sedimentary strata in the Northeast Plain in China should be carried out to explore the paleoclimatic record of the area, including the regional climatic response to the MPT.

The project consisted of the construction of one municipal wastewater treatment facility with a total capacity of 90,720 m(3)/day, five main sewage collectors, one irrigation system with a reservoir called Tenorio that receives most of the treated water, and one distribution system (38-km pipe) that allows reusing the tertiary effluent in the cooling towers of the Power Villa de Reyes. The project has been in operation for almost 5 years, and so far it has reached almost 90% of the plant capacity with significant impact over the restoration of the Tenorio ecosystem due to the improvement of the water quality, and although only 50% of the flow is received in power plant, it has served to the purpose of saving 40 Mm(3) of potable water. Before the beginning of the operation, "Tenorio" reservoir had been receiving raw wastewater and wildlife became scarce. Currently, the return of wildlife is very substantial, and the site has become a nesting site for several migratory birds' species. The Project Tenorio is the first on its type in Mexico that combines industrial water reuse, agricultural reuse, aquifer recovery, and the recovery of and the development of ecosystem that could be considered as an artificial wetland. It is well known that wetlands provide habitat for plants and animals and also absorb excess nutrients, sediments, and other pollutants before they reach rivers, lakes, and other water bodies or in our case before part of the water is used for irrigation of crops. In the case of the Tenorio reservoir, once the artificial internal walls were completed and it was filled with the effluent of the Tenorio Plant, the native plants were restored and the natural depuration process was established to complete the treatment of the water improving significantly its quality. In the spring or 2010, the presence of Daphnia, which are well know for being used as indicator organisms for toxicity test, was definitely consider as indicator of the lack of toxic substances that had been successfully removed by the treatment plant and by the natural depuration process that occurs in the reservoir. During the last 3 years, the number of migrating birds has increased and there are several species of birds that have been observed to rest, feed, and nest during their cross-continental journeys. The quality of the water has been monitored during the last 3 years (BOD, COD, TSS, nitrogen, and coliforms), and it has been found that even though the rate of improvement is low, the effects are notorious over the ecosystem. The power plant management is very satisfied with the use or recycled water since they have proven the reliability of the system in terms of both quality and quantity.																			1944-3994					JAN	2013	51	1-3					169	174		10.1080/19443994.2012.714649	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19443994.2012.714649													WOS:000313790300020
J	Dam, G; Sonderholm, M				Dam, Gregers; Sonderholm, Martin			Tectonostratigraphic evolution, palaeogeography and main petroleum plays of the Nuussuaq Basin: An outcrop analogue for the Cretaceous-Palaeogene rift basins offshore West Greenland	MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY												has incised valley, submarine canyon and turbidite sandstones as reservoirs, and Campanian and Paleocene mudstones as seal and source. The Break-up and Drift Play is subdivided into three sub-plays, including: a Lacustrine Sub-play, an Intra-basaltic Siliciclastic Sub-play and a Fractured Volcanic Sub-play. The Lacustrine Sub-play has fluvio-deltaic sandstones as reservoir and intra-formational lacustrine and delta-plain mudstones as seal. The Intra-basaltic Siliciclastic Sub-play comprise fluvial and lacustrine sandstones as reservoir and volcaniclastic or siliciclastic mudstones as seal. The Fractured Volcanic Sub-play comprises fractured, porous volcanic rocks as reservoir and intra-basaltic mudstones or tight fine-grained volcanic rocks as seal. All three sub-plays require vertical or long-distance migration of hydrocarbons from deeper-seated Cretaceous - Lower Paleocene kitchens. Because the tectonostratigraphic phases recognised in the Nuussuaq Basin can also be applied to the regional seismic mapping offshore Greenland the implications of the Nuussuaq Basin plays can be applied to the The onshore Nuussuaq Basin in central West Greenland comprises a complete Albian-Paleocene succession and as such represents the only complete rift succession outcrop analogue for the Cretaceous-Palaeogene offshore frontier basins in West Greenland. The basin fill reflects five tectonostratigraphic phases: 1) Pre-rift, 2) Albian - Early Cenomanian Early Rift, 3) Early Cenomanian - Early Campanian Thermal Subsidence, 4) Early Campanian - Early Paleocene Late Rift, and 5) Early Paleocene - Late Eocene Break-up and Drift. In addition, the succession is divided into nine tectonostratigraphic sequences (TSSs), each representing a specific configuration of depositional elements resulting mainly from tectonic events, which caused major palaeogeographic reconstruction of the basin and therefore critical to the petroleum systems. The sequences are bounded by unconformities or, in one case, by a major flooding phase. The Early Rift Phase in the Nuussuaq Basin was initiated in the Albian with development of half-grabens along N-S directed extensional faults. This phase was characterised by continued growth along extensional faults and embraces three TSSs (TSS1-3). They are characterised by alluvial fan, fandelta and lacustrine sedimentation, wave- and tidal-dominated deltaic deposition, followed by a major fall in relative sea level and canyon incision. Oil seeps indicate presence of a lacustrine/brackish-water source rock at depth. During the following Late Cenomanian - Early Campanian Thermal Subsidence Phase a regional marine drowning of the basin took place with deposition of organic-rich mudstones, followed by re-establishment of deltaic deposition in the Coniacian-Santonian (TSS4). The Early Campanian - Early Paleocene Late Rift Phase was associated with a change in stress regime, formation of NW-SE directed extensional faults, uplift of highs and a major change in depositional environments from deltaic deposition to deposition from gravity flows in a confined system of slope channels and canyons. During the initial phase, structurally-controlled turbidite channels were established in a NW-SE trending graben-like structure that acted as conduits for sediment transport into the offshore areas (TSS5). This was followed by several phases of major uplift resulting from the rise of the Proto-Icelandic Mantle Plume prior to continental break-up eventually leading to the deposition of two structurally controlled TSSs (TSS6-7) characterised by the formation of submarine and subaerial canyons that acted as conduits for huge amounts of sediments transported into the offshore areas. The Nuussuaq Basin experienced significant subsidence during the initial phase of break-up volcanism with deposition of organic-rich Lower Paleocene marine mudstones blanketing the basin followed by a thick succession of Paleocene-Eocene volcanic rocks referred to as the West Greenland Basalt Province (TSS8-9). Volcanism gradually spread eastwards eventually blocking the connection to the sea stemming up a large lake between the prograding volcanic front and the cratonic mainland to the east. Finally, when the volcanic rocks covered the entire basin, rivers were redirected, and sediments were deposited in the offshore Sisimiut Basin to the south and the Melville Bay Basin to the north. During this latest rifting and break-up phase, the Nuussuaq Basin was aborted and terminated as a failed rift basin. Four main plays have been defined based on the tectonostratigraphic subdivision: An Early Rift Play, a Thermal Subsidence Play, a Late Rift Play and a Break-up and Drift Play. The Early Rift Play has alluvial and estuarine sandstones as reservoir, Albian lacustrine/brackish-water mudstones as source rock and Cenomanian-Turonian mudstones as seal. The Thermal Subsidence Play has deltaic and shallow marine sandstones as reservoirs, Cenomanian-Turonian mudstones as source and Campanian mudstones as seal.

J	Mudie, PJ; Rochon, A; Aksu, AE; Gillespie, H				Mudie, PJ; Rochon, A; Aksu, AE; Gillespie, H			Dinoflagellate cysts, freshwater algae and fungal spores as salinity indicators in Late Quaternary cores from Marmara and Black seas	MARINE GEOLOGY												Seismic profiles and mollusks have been used to suggest that from similar to 12 500 to 7000 yr BP, the Black Sea was an isolated freshwater lake containing potable water and implying a surface salinity of < 1. According to Ryan and Pitman (1999), these circumstances encouraged Neolithic settlement and farming on the shore of the Black Sea. This model conflicts with previous studies of dinoflagellate cysts and seismic profiles from the Marmara Sea. Here we investigate Ryan and Pittman's model using palynological studies of organic-walled dinoflagellate cysts, acritarchs, freshwater algae, microforaminifera, and fungal remains as tracers of changes in surface salinity for seven cores of pleniglacial to Holocene sediments from the Marmara and Black seas. Core-top data from 16 sites along a salinity gradient from 39.5 in the Aegean Sea to similar to 17 in the Black Sea show that the dinocyst species Impagidinium aculeatum, Impagidinium patulum, Operculodinium israelianum, Polysphaeridium zoharyi and Nematosphaeropsis labyrinthus are markers of Mediterranean Sea water and summer surface salinity > 24, and that Spiniferites cruciformis, Spiniferites inaequalis, Peridinium ponticum, Polykrikos spp. and Quinquecuspis concreta characterize the lower salinity of the Marmara and/or Black seas. The core-top data and correlatable down-core assemblage changes in time-equivalent sapropelic and brown muds show that there is no evidence for differential aerobic decay of dinocysts in the study area. The main acritarchs are Sigmopollis psilatum, Concentricystes cf. C rubinus and cf. Acritarch-8 of Traverse (1978), all of which are absent from the Aegean Sea and decrease in abundance with increasing salinity; the first two taxa have been reported previously as freshwater species. Fungal remains show a similar distribution pattern to the freshwater acritarchs, indicating their origin from terrestrial environments. Freshwater Chlorococcales are almost confined to the Black Sea but they have rare occurrences in the Aegean, indicating long-distance transport. Microforaminiferal linings are abundant in the Marmara Sea but are absent in deep water of the Black Sea. In the Marmara Sea, mid-late Holocene assemblages (<7 ka) are dominated by Lingulodinium machaerophorum, Operculodinium centrocarpum and halophilic Mediterranean Spiniferites spp. (S. mirabilis, S. hyperacanthus, S. bentorii), and a diversity of heterotrophic protoperidinioid and Polykrikos species are present in both sapropels and brown lutites. In contrast, the early Holocene interval (including sapropels) has fewer halophilic Spiniferites spp. and other Mediterranean taxa (O. israelianum, Polysphaeridium zoharyi) and more low salinity indicators (P. ponticum, Pyxidinopsis psilata and S. cruciformis), suggesting that the overflow of Black Sea water was greater than now. The time-equivalent early Holocene unit in the Black Sea has a higher percentage of taxa found in freshwater environments (including S. cruciformis forms 1-3; Gonyaulax apiculata, fungal remains and freshwater acritarchs) but the continued presence of Spiniferites morphotypes and other taxa associated with brackish (similar to 7-18) to saline surface water indicates that there was some Mediterranean water present at this time. The late glacial and Pleniglacial sediments in the Marmara Sea contain a lower diversity of dinoflagellates, dominated by S. cruciformis and P. psilata, as in early Holocene sediments of the Black Sea but including the short-spine morphotypes of S. cruciformis which are not found in freshwater lakes. We conclude that although the glacial stages were marked by much lower sea-surface temperatures, there was either some periodic marine influence or the marine dinocysts were living in a brackish water environment (similar to7-18) with the freshwater species being transported from glacial lakes. Overall, there is no palynological evidence that the surface salinity of the Black or Marmara seas was ever as low as a freshwater lake. This finding is consistent with models that estimate the time required to desalinate the Black Sea after closing of the Marmara-Bosphorus gateway. Crown Copyright (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

A various transformations of mineral and organic components (diagenesis, dehydration, recrystallization, cementation, chemical reactions) take place in sediment, leading to the migration of nutrients compounds from sediment to water. The bottom sediment is composed of mineral and organic substances removed from the water during the processes of precipitation, sorption and sedimentation. Bottom sediment, that fills river beds, is characterized by a completely different chemical composition comparing to lake sediment. This is caused by the constant flow of water in the river and its good oxygenation. The aim of study was analysis of chemical composition of riverine and lacustrine bottom sediment. Research of bottom sediment was carried in the lake - river system of upper Pasleka. The upper Pasleka basin is situated in the north-east of Poland. The river Pasleka flows into Vistula Lagoon. The total area of the upper Pasleka River basin is 246 7 km2, while the length of the upper part of the river is 40.5 km (total area of Pasleka catchment is 2294 5 km2, total length of river is 211 km). The average fall of the upper course of Pasleka is 1.70 parts per thousand. Pasleka River in upper course flows through the lakes with different morphometric properties: Paslek, Wymoj, Samg, Leguty and Isag. The surface of lakes ranges from 8.5 to 397.5 ha, and a maximum depth - 5.0 to 54.5 m. The research showed a clear spatial differentiation of the content of silica, organic matter and carbon dioxide in the bottom sediments of particular river and lakes sections. The percentage share of other bottom sediments components i.e. macroelements (Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn) and nutrients (P, N), was also various in river and lake sediment. The dominant component of river sediments was silica (56.9 to 96.7% d.w.). With the flow of the river, the share of silica in the sediment was higher. In lake sediment, silica was also predominant, but not in such a wide range as in the river (24.8 to 53.2% d.w.). The content of organic matter in river sediment did not exceed 27%. In the sediments of the lakes Paslek and Sarqg organic matter was the second component of sediments and ranged from 19.5 to 30.1%. In other lakes the content of organic components ranged from 12.3 to 20.3%. In lake sediment a high proportion of carbon dioxide was noted - between 14.4 and 24.2%, while in river sediment, this component did not exceed 6.3%.					; Augustyniak, Renata/AAY-3672-2021	Augustyniak-Tunowska, Renata/0000-0003-0098-0427; Lopata, Michal/0000-0002-1993-3287; Grochowska, Jolanta/0000-0001-7319-4174; Parszuto, Katarzyna/0000-0002-1373-2265													1755-1307						2019	221								012116	10.1088/1755-1315/221/1/012116	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/221/1/012116													WOS:000560708000116

AIPIN's STORY "THE STAR OF THE MORNING DAWN": THE PLOT OF THE JOURNEY AND THE MYTH OF THE PEOPLE	EZHEGODNIK FINNO-UGORSKIKH ISSLEDOVANII-YEARBOOK OF FINNO-UGRIC STUDIES												The article examines the specifics of the travel story in the prose of the famous Russian-speaking Khanty writer E. D. Aipin. The material for the study was the story "The Star of the Morning Dawn". The purpose of the article is to identify the mechanisms of constructing the travel plot in the genre thinking of the Khanty prose writer of the traditionalist type. The methodology of this research is based on a combination of elements of the doctrine of his- torical poetics, an ethnophilological approach to the analysis of literary phenomena , a genre analysis of the text. The work captures the connection of this plot with the phenomenon of movement, which in the views of the Khanty is one of the significant elements of the worldview. The journey in the text is based on a model: a description of packing for the road, fateful meetings for the hero on the way. Due to the inclusion of folklore elements (omen) in the narrative, the hero begins to feel impending trouble during his preparations , the Universe informs him about it. In the Khanty culture, deer are considered sacred animals, therefore, in the story, the movement of the reindeer sled contributes to the fusion of the main character with Space. A special connection with deer is confirmed by the change in the pace of their movement as anxiety increases, the hero's desire to consult with them about choosing a path. There are three meetings with "strangers" in the story: 1) a chance meeting with drillers at the Spring Lake; 2) a deliberate meeting between Demyan and drillers; 3) a meeting between Demyan and chief Medvedev. The feeling of anxiety from the first to the second meeting increases, culminating in the loss of importance. The third meeting returns the hero to a sense of harmony, largely due to the mythologization of the character of the surname of the Russian chief, the belief in the possibility of coexistence of representatives of different cultures on the same territory is indicated. The fate and path of the main character merge with the fate of the Khanty people by introducing the reflection of the character, which is not separated from the narrator. Mythological and real spaces constantly touch throughout Demyan's path: the hero hears the music of the Universe, imagines the Khanty and himself as stars. The narrative of the "Stars of the Morning Dawn" acquires mythological features and is perceived as a "myth about the Khanty people", which opens up the possibility of transforming the story into a novel structure. As a further perspective of the study, we see the design of the genre aspect of the study of E. D. Aipin's work, which captures the transition from the short story to the novel.																			2224-9443	2311-0333					2025	19	2					229	237		10.35634/2224-9443-2025-19-2-229-237	http://dx.doi.org/10.35634/2224-9443-2025-19-2-229-237													WOS:001529101700008

Rb-Sr isochron method of sediment source fingerprinting reveals a fundamental shift in erosion in response to anthropogenic land use	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Human alterations to landscapes can greatly influence watershed-scale sedimentary processes; therefore, in this study, we test the viability of a novel Rb-Sr isotope and elemental geochemical method for fingerprinting the impacts of human land use on sediment provenance. We analyzed a similar to 1200year sediment core record from Little Kennebago Lake, Maine, USA, that captures negligible anthropogenic activity pre-1900 CE, timber transport downstream during log drives (1900-1952 CE), and increased road construction and timber harvest (1952-2018 CE). 87Sr/86Sr data alone reveal several spikes, likely due to storm events, and variability but no systematic shift at the onset of logging. The pre-logging record Rb-Sr isotope data comprise an isochron corresponding to an age of 354 +/- 16 Ma (two standard errors [2SE]; mean square of weighted deviates [MSWD] = 2.1, n = 33). None of the bedrock or glacial till sources that we analyzed fall along the pre-logging isochron, nor did any binary or ternary bulk rock mixtures. However, the linearity of all pre-logging samples and coincidence of the isochron age with Acadian metamorphism in the region suggests that sediment was derived from a single source in the undisturbed watershed, though that exact bedrock or glacial till source remains unclear. The onset of logging coincides with a shift toward generally lower sediment Rb-Sr isotope ratios that are offset from the pre- logging isochron. This logging data forms a scattered pseudo-isochron with an apparent Carboniferous age of 322 +/- 32 Ma (2SE; MSWD = 4.5, n = 10). No rocks of this age exist in the region. Therefore, we interpret this age to have no geologic meaning and instead reflect the introduction of new sediment sources due to logging. Logging also coincides with subtle changes in elemental geochemistry. The Big Island Pond Pluton underlies most of the northern part of the watershed and is the only catchment lithology capable of producing each geochemical change; therefore, we conclude that it was the primary new source of sediment introduced by logging. We found little variation in sediment geochemistry between the period of early log drives and later road expansion, suggesting that sediment provenance was constant once altered by the initial onset of logging, which could reflect the same source being tapped by activities in each period. We established a framework for interpreting bulk sediment Rb-Sr isotope ratios and demonstrated their viability for identifying shifts in human impacts on geomorphic processes. Our findings suggest that relative changes in sediment Rb-Sr isotope ratios are a promising tool for investigating changes to sedimentary processes not identifiable by other commonly used fingerprints and that the method should be further tested in a range of other natural and anthropogenic settings globally.

Chandra; Kumar, Vishal; Joshi, Yogesh			Abundance, diversity and distribution patterns of macrolichens for Long-Term Environmental Monitoring (LTEM) in the Chaudans Valley of Kailash Sacred Landscape, India	SYDOWIA												Realizing the importance of long-term monitoring for the assessment of the environmental status of the Kailash Sacred Landscape (KSL), an attempt has been made through assessing the abundance, diversity and distribution patterns of macrolichens in the Chaudans Valley. Since lichens are considered as the indicators of forest health, it is reliable to study their abundance, diversity and distribution patterns in a landscape for analyzing its environmental status. Macrolichens were studied in eight 20 x 20 m stratified random quadrats within the altitude ranging from 2400-4000 m. The study revealed the occurrence of 2157 colonies of macrolichens represented by 14 families, 30 genera and 60 species. Woody component (bark of trees and fallen twigs) was best for the macrolichen colonization in the study area supporting 1324 colonies followed by rock (574) and soil (259). Umbilicaria indica was the most abundant species confined to rocks. Peltigera polydactylon showed a broad range of distribution (2484-4071 m) due to its presence in all eight plots. Statistically, the relationship of altitude with species richness, number of genera and number of colonies was significant. With increasing altitude the species richness of macrolichen in Chaudans Valley was decreasing. Due to the diverse physiographic features of the landscape such a study further needs to be done in different regions preferably in other valleys and watersheds to find out the environmental status of the whole landscape. Due to the very slow growth rates of lichens it is recommended to monitor the same area for a period of about ten years for obtaining realistic results and draw inferences about changes during this time span to predict the future scenario. The present paper provides baseline data regarding the abundance, diversity and distribution patterns of macrolichens in the Chaudans Valley that can be monitored for long time periods to detect the changes over time. KSL is of great religious significance. The world famous Mt. Kailash and Manasarovara Lake are the main points of spiritual and sacred values of this landscape due to which thousands of people visit this region every year from different parts of the world. Chhota Kailash and Om Parwat are also of great religious significance in KSL. There is no doubt that KSL is spiritually sacred but its environmental sacredness is also of great importance and there is an urgent need of carrying out studies through which the environmental status of the region can be understood. The bioindicator and biomonitor roles of lichens can be helpful here. If its environmental sacredness declines, sooner or later its spiritual sacredness will also be disappeared. So, there is an urgent need to carry out such studies on the environmental status of the region and to take the necessary steps to protect its environmental sacredness.

C	Clark, T; Pretzel, S		Kleinmann, B; Skousen, J; Wolkersdorfer, C		Clark, Thomas; Pretzel, Sami			Tioga river watershed restoration: Design considerations and updates	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL MINE WATER ASSOCIATION CONFERENCE & WEST VIRGINIA MINE DRAINAGE TASK FORCE SYMPOSIUM 2024					2024 International Mine Water Association Conference & West Virginia Mine Drainage Task Force Symposium	APR 21-26, 2024	Morgantown, WV	Envirogen Inc, Solmax International Inc				The Tioga River, a major tributary to the Upper Susquehanna River Basin, has been negatively affected by Northern Bituminous Coal Field abandoned mine drainage (AMD) stemming from legacy coal mining that began in the mid-1800s, ending in the 1980s. This AMD loading pollution, centered around the Borough of Blossburg and the village of Morris Run in Tioga County, Pennsylvania (PA), has rendered over 32 km of the Tioga River and several tributaries as fishless due to acidity, iron, and aluminum loadings. The severe extent of the entire problem combining relatively highflow AMD outfalls containing elevated acidity and metal concentrations, has created a pollution problem that was economically unfeasible to consider for treatment as a whole, historically. This economic problem was solved with the passage of the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the yearly funds allocated to PA for abandoned mine land (AML) reclamation and AMD treatment. The five deep mine AMD discharges outfall near one another and enter the Tioga River within an 8-km stretch. This proximity of the outfalls and rural character of Tioga County allows for the capture / conveyance of these flows to a centralized active treatment plant that will be capable of treating 57 x 10(6) L/d. In 2021, the Susquehanna River Basin Commission (SRBC) received a PA Department of Environmental Protection AML Economic Revitalization grant to complete a full design to accomplish that objective. SRBC awarded Kleinfelder the design contract for the Morris Run AMD active treatment plant Project in 2022, with design completion slated for first-quarter 2024. The combination of five AMD discharges with varying quantities and qualities creates future operational challenges that had to be managed through risk assessment design decisions. However, having nearly all watershed AMD now treated at one active treatment plant also allowed for considerations to be made as to where best to discharge the treated effluent to maximize the total length of stream restoration, while also keeping the treated water cold to aid wild salmonid presence and reproduction within the Tioga River and its tributaries. These considerations will restore around 32 km of the Tioga River, the 202 ha Tioga Lake, and an additional 6 km of cold-water fishery habitat on two Tioga River tributaries: Fall Brook and Morris Run. These treatment design decisions that consider the management of uncontrollable AMD flows containing elevated acidity and metal loading, along with the applications implemented to best utilize the treated effluent to maximize stream restoration gains and protect river ecology, can be replicated in other watersheds containing similar large flow and loading AMD discharges. Kleinfelder's presentation at the 2024 International Mine Water Association Conference will describe in more detail these complexities and how they were managed within the design plans for the active treatment plant.																					978-3-9825-2932-5				2024							79	84																WOS:001517409300015
J	Hoyer, MV; Bachmann, RW; Canfield, DE				Hoyer, Mark V.; Bachmann, Roger W.; Canfield, Daniel E., Jr.			Lake management (muck removal) and hurricane impacts to the trophic state of Lake Tohopekaliga, Florida	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Lake Tohopekaliga is a large (surface area 9,800 ha) and shallow (mean depth 2.1 m) natural lake in central Florida. Cultural eutrophication and lake water level stabilization led to accelerated growth of invasive native and non-native aquatic macrophytes, resulting in the buildup of thick deposits of organic matter along the shoreline. Those shoreline areas were often devoid of oxygen, and the muck buildup filled feeding grounds for wading birds and spawning fish. Muck build up has also reduced aesthetics and boat access. To remove organic accumulation, the lake water level was dropped and heavy equipment was used to scrape the plants and dead organic materials from the underlying sand substrates from more than 1,420 ha of the littoral zone. Most of this material was heaped into large piles in shallow parts of the lake to form 29 artificial islands with basal areas from 0.4 to 3.3 ha each. Our study was designed to determine: (1) amount of nutrients stored in islands relative to annual inflows, (2) nutrient release to the lake from the islands, and (3) changes in lake trophic state due to the muck scraping and construction of the islands. The lake enhancement project was completed in late summer 2004, and the average thickness of organic materials in the scrapped areas was reduced from 46 cm to 1.6 cm, improving access and aesthetics tremendously. The islands stored several times the annual inflow of total phosphorus (TP, 3.1 times) and Total Nitrogen (TN, 6.5 times) and thus could potentially affect the lake's trophic state by leaching nutrients. Our study of water quality in the vicinity of the islands indicates that the islands had no statistically significant impact on the water chemistry of the lake through leaching of nutrients. In the 2 years following the muck removal, substantial increases in average TP (39%), chlorophyll (56%), and color (53%) and a decline in dissolved oxygen (-10%) were found in open water stations. An unintended complication to our experimental design was the occurrence of 3 major hurricanes with high winds and heavy rainfalls that passed over the Lake Tohopekaliga area immediately following the muck removal project. To account for the effects of hurricane activity we examined monthly TP, TN, chlorophyll, Secchi depth data, and quarterly color values measured for 55 relatively small (median surface area 33 ha), nearby lakes. Our sample of 55 nearby lakes showed significant increases in TP (8.2%), TN (4.1%), chlorophyll (20.1%), and water color (23.8%), and decreases in Secchi depth (-8.2%) coinciding with the passage of the hurricanes. Additionally, data from a larger control lake (Kissimmee, surface area 19,800 ha) located 10 km south of Lake Tohopekaliga showed a much larger increase in total phosphorus (66%). Therefore, some or possibly all of the differences we measured before and after scraping could have been the result of low quality water (high nutrients and organic color) flushed into the lake following the heavy rains (93 cm in August and September of 2004) accompanying the storms. The effects of muck removal cannot be completely separated from those of hurricanes because they both occurred at the same time. However, aquatic plant (Florida Department of Environmental Protection) and water chemistry (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission) data collected after this project was completed show that submersed aquatic macrophytes in Lake Tohopekaliga have returned and total phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations are down to levels measured prior to muck scraping and hurricane impacts. Thus, the changes in water chemistry caused by muck removal and/or the hurricanes were relatively short lived (approximately 2 years).																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2008	24	1					57	68		10.1080/07438140809354051	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140809354051													WOS:000269665800007

In contrast, the Ina rough floor unit and the flank regions are very different. The same relationships are observed when using PolCam polarimetric data of the Danuri mission, as well as Earth-based telescope measurements. In particular, with optical data the rough floor areas display a higher abundance of TiO2 and larger mean particle size. Chandrayaan 1 M3 spectral data for Ina reveal a locally more intensive absorption band near 3 mu m, indicating an excess of H2O/ OH-compounds. Using these data, we analyze different models for the formation of the Ina pit crater, finding that the roof-collapse scenario appears most consistent with the observations. In this scenario, ancient basalt eruptions from the proto-Ina vent created the shield volcano. Next, the lava lake in the volcanic pit crater cooled and solidified from the upper surface downward, and roofed over, while the underlying lava lake, assisted by magmatic degassing, subsequently drained into the vent below, forming a void, with preferentially cooled vertical pillars supporting the roof. Over the next several billion years, detailed traces of the roofing event were obscured by regolith-formation processes. Recently, in the last tens of millions of years, the ancient, roofed void collapsed due to an impact and associate impact/tectonic seismic activity. The seismic effects, which accompany the formation of the crater Tycho, are considered as a feasible cause of the collapse. During this collapse, many of the superposed craters, and a portion of the regolith on the mound surfaces were lost. The rough floor terrain formed simultaneously from the collapse of blocks, debris, and shedding of regolith of the roof materials fallen in voids. The terrain were formed around groups of the pillars. These flat-topped mounds are interpreted as surviving roof remnants. New craters were then formed, but their density distribution is much lower than on the surrounding Ina shield volcano, indicating the recent age of the collapse event. This model explains the similarity of the composition and maturity of the regolith of the mounds and surrounding areas, as well as difference between the composition of the mounds and rough floor terrain. This recent roof-collapse model is also in agreement with the excess of H2O/OH-compounds in the rough floor terrain that are considered to be young. The young age of the rough floor terrain is consistent with the photometric and polarimetric data that predict undeveloped fairy-castle microstructure and the availability of large particles in the regolith.

It cumulated subtly into consciousness of release-and protect lives. The motive of teapot craft design originated from unconsciously kill-and-persecute to environ-ecology by human self-centeredness since the Anthropocene. Sustainability become one of the most thematic of recent artistic creation, comparing to black-faced spoonbill pottery as one of the themes in this thesis, it is found that ecology is mostly an expression of creative skills in earlier artists' works than the social responsibility not shown, although. Thus, this paper precipitate-and-transform from "The Identity about the Matter and Me" firstly, then represent the (Bio)Social Sculpture among human and wildlife in the intertidal ecosystem by "Sociological Imagination". Aquatic system intertwining mountains, creeks, lakes, rivers into sea, which continued those real stories like starved Buffalos of cold highland, Bear strayed into boar trap, Leopard cat road killed, Elephant died of pineapple bomb, Whale fall organism and wisdom of Octopus. That constituted a discourse subjects of ceramic art compounded by such endless tragedies under the high and low tides. In the "Di-Zai" (Earth Sustain) series, which succeeding created 10 items of works and named respectively as: (1) Break off the shell; (2) Survival of the fittest; (3) Mimicry and camouflage; (4) Gaze with longing eyes; (5) Habitat restoration; (6) Fight for the foods with human; (7) Community symbiosis; (8) At the mercy of nature; (9) Epimeletic incubation, and; (10) Flight of ideas, etc. Another "Hai-Han" (Sea Rehabilitate) series of 10 items, respectively named: (1) Deep-sea submergence; (2) Benthic organisms; (3) Pandora's box, origin of species; (4) Semi-biological mug; (5) Implements of waste antiquity; (6) Petrochemical disposal creation; (7) Co-synthesis tea pot; (8) Relationship in reflexivity; (9) Earth grow myriads of objects, and; (10) Mental image of representation, etc. Inclusion, after the social practice throughout crafts design and creation, this article suggests a new methodology of "Biosocial Sculpture" plays a comprehensive role of `interactive design' to eco-artistic creation", that is, approaching Gesamtkunstwerk of the Sociological Imagination between humans and marine creatures. It reinterpret-and-transform the delicate "Human-Matter" relationship, reappear the form of ideas originate from the ceramic art creators. Furthermore, these works not only initiate popular to pay attention to the human selfishness and disregard to biology, but also transform the social relationship to the environmental art education. It highlights a "social interaction design" engaging popular praxis based on daily tea wares with art education influence directly, keeping on recreation for a "surpass selfhood" endlessly in future.

J	Möller, P; Rosenthal, E; Geyer, S; Flexer, A				Moeller, Peter; Rosenthal, Eliyahu; Geyer, Stefan; Flexer, Akiva			Chemical evolution of saline waters in the Jordan-Dead Sea transform and in adjoining areas	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The Ca-Mg relationship in groundwaters strongly points to the overall dolomitization and local albitization. The Mg/Ca ratios reveal two trends by which saline waters develop: increase of Mg/Ca ratio by evaporation and decreasing Mg/Ca ratios due to dolomitization and albitization. Br/Cl vs. Na/Cl ratios demonstrate that albitization does not play a major role which leaves dolomitization to be the main source for decreasing Mg/Ca ratios in saline waters. In the eastern and southern Region of Lake Kinneret, salinization occurs by mixing with a Ca/Mg molar ratio < 1 brine (Ha'On type). Along the western shoreline of the Lake, a Ca/Mg > 1 dominates, which developed by the albitization of plagioclase in abundant mafic volcanics and the dolomitization of limestones. The most saline groundwater of the Tabgha-, Fuliya-, and Tiberias clusters could be regional derivatives of at least two mother brines: in diluted form one is represented by Ha'On water, the other is a Na-rich brine of the Zemah type. Additionally, a deep-seated Ca-dominant brine may ascend along the fractures on the western side of Lake Kinneret, which is absent on the eastern side. Groundwaters of the Lower Jordan Valley are chemically different on both sides of the Jordan River, indicating that the exchange of water is insignificant. All saline waters from the Dead Sea and its surroundings represent a complex mixture of brines, and precipitation and local dissolution of halite and gypsum. Many wells of the Arava/Araba Valley pump groundwater from the Upper Cretaceous limestone aquifer, the origin of the water is actually from the Lower Cretaceous Kurnub Group sandstones. Groundwater drawn from the Quaternary alluvial fill either originates from Kurnub Group sandstones (Eilat 108, Yaalon 117) or from altered limestones of the Judea Group. The origin of these waters is from floods flowing through wadis incised into calcareous formations of the Judea Group. On the other hand, as a result of step-faulting, hydraulic contact is locally established between the Kurnub- and the Judea Groups aquifers facilitating the inter-aquifer flow of the confined Kurnub paleowater into the karstic formations of the Judea Group. Two periods of Neogene brine formation are considered: the post-Messinan inland lagoon resulting in drying up of the Sdom Sea and the evaporation of the Pleistocene Samra Lake, which went further through the stage of Lake Lisan to the present Dead Sea. For the first period, major element hydrochemistry suggests that the saline waters and brines in the Jordan-Dead Sea-Arava Valley transform evolved from the gradual evaporation of an accumulating mixture of sea-, ground-, and surface water. Due to the precipitation of carbonates, gypsum, and halite, such an evaporating primary water body was strongly enriched in Mg, Br, and B and shows high molar ratios of Br/Cl, B/Cl, and Mg/Ca but low Na/Cl ratios. The development of the Br/Cl ratio is chemically modelled, showing that indeed brine development is explicable that way. Along with the evaporation brine, evaporites formed which are leached by infiltrating fresh water yielding secondary brines with Na/Cl ratios of 1. When primary brines infiltrated the sub-surface, they were subjected to Mg-Ca exchange in limestones (dolomitization) and to chloritization and albitization in basic igneous rocks turning them into Ca-Cl brines. These tertiary brines are omnipresent in the Rift. The brines of the late Lisan and Dead Sea were generated by evaporating drainage waters, which leached halite, gypsum, and carbonates from the soil ad from the sub-surface. All these brines are still being flushed out by meteoric water, resulting in saline groundwaters. This flushing is regionally enhanced by intensive groundwater exploitation. In variable proportions, the Neogene and late Lisan Lake and Recent Dead Sea brines have to be considered as the most serious sources of salinization of groundwaters in the Rift. Deep-seated pre-Sdom brines cannot strictly be excluded, but if active they play a negligible role only.					; Geyer, Stefan/D-4785-2015	Moller, Peter/0000-0003-1580-4215; Geyer, Stefan/0000-0003-1746-9019													1437-3254	1437-3262				JUN	2007	96	3					541	566		10.1007/s00531-006-0111-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00531-006-0111-9													WOS:000246354800009

However, data about MPs in freshwater systems are still limited so far. This study investigated sources, fate, and seasonal and spatial distribution of MPs in the main stream Pearl River and its tributaries, as well as in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), China. MPs were widely detected in the river water, river bed sediment, and estuarine sediment, with abundances of 0.57 +/- 0.71 items L-1, 685 +/- 342 items kg(-1) dry weight (dw), and 258 +/- 133 items kg(-1) dw, respectively. Sheet, fragmental, and fibrous polyethylene, polypropylene, and ethylene-propylene copolymers were predominant, suggesting that MPs in the Pearl River catchment be mainly derived from fragmentation of discarded plastic wastes. In addition, municipal wastewater was also an important MPs source, especially for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers. Polymers of higher density, such as PET and polyvinyl alcohol were relatively more abundant in the sediment than in the river water, especially in the estuarine sediment. Upward increase of the MP abundance was observed in the sedimentary core, probably indicating increasing release of plastic wastes due to growing production and uses of plastic products. On the other hand, percentage of finer MPs increased with increasing depth. The results revealed persistence and potential downward dispersion of the fine MPs. The MPs abundance was positively related with population density and gross domestic product, demonstrating impacts of human activities and economic development on the MPs contamination. Higher MPs abundance was detected in dry season than in wet season in the river water, suggesting dilution effect of precipitation. It's estimated that 15963 tons of MPs could be released annually into the PRE from the main stream Pearl River and its tributaries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Li, CJ; Kohn, T				Li, Chaojie; Kohn, Tamar			Waterborne Virus Transport and Risk Assessment in Lake Geneva Under Climate Change	EARTHS FUTURE												Climate changes influence lake hydrodynamics and radiation levels and thus may affect the fate and transport of waterborne pathogens in lakes. This study examines the impact of climate change on the fate, transport, and associated risks of four waterborne viruses in Lake Geneva. We used a coupled water quality-microbial risk assessment model to estimate virus concentrations and associated risks to recreational water users for each month in 2019 and 2060. Long-term hydrodynamic simulations suggested that although the annual hydrodynamic transport pattern of Lake Geneva will remain relatively stable, a 1.9 degrees C increase of lake surface water temperature can be expected, while a slight decrease in lake current velocity may occur. The subsequent effect on the fate and transport of the four enteric viruses was found to vary by time of year. During warmer periods, the increase of virus inactivation due to higher water temperature and stronger solar radiation at the earth's surface will compensate for the additional virus discharge brought about by population growth over the time period considered, whereas during winter the virus concentration near the lake shore and the associated infection probabilities risks are likely to increase due to population growth. Additionally, the current estimation of virus inactivation rate shows significant variability, which has a more substantial effect on enteric virus concentrations in the lake compared with changing climate parameters. Overall, the study suggests that future risks posed by enteric viruses with recreational water users near popular beaches around Lake Geneva will likely remain similar to current risks and accurate estimation of the environmental inactivation of viruses is crucial for predicting the fate of enteric viruses in the aquatic system. This study investigates the impact of climate change on the fate, transport, and associated risks of four waterborne viruses in Lake Geneva, Switzerland, using a coupled water quality-microbial risk assessment model. The results indicate that the influence of changing environmental conditions on the fate and transport of enteric viruses varies by time of year. Additionally, the current estimation of virus inactivation rate shows significant variability, which has a more substantial effect on enteric virus concentrations in the lake compared with changing climate parameters. Overall, the study suggests that the risks posed by enteric viruses with recreational water users near popular beaches around Lake Geneva in 2060 will likely remain similar to current risks. However, accurate estimation of the environmental inactivation of viruses is crucial for predicting the fate of enteric viruses in aquatic systems in the future.

Vertical Profile Climatology of Polarimetric Radar Variables and Retrieved Microphysical Parameters in Synoptic and Lake Effect Snowstorms	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												This study derives polarimetric radar vertical profiles and microphysical retrievals for 25 Synoptic Snow (SS) and 23 Lake Effect Snow (LES) cases using the Range-Defined Quasi-Vertical Profiles (RD-QVP), Columnar Vertical Profiles (CVP), and Process-oriented Vertical Profiles (POVP) methods. For all vertical profile techniques, SS cases exhibit a near-linear increase in reflectivity from -30 to 0 degrees C whereas ZDR and Kdp locally peak in the dendritic growth layer. LES cases universally exhibit negative ZDR, rather high Z, negligible Kdp, and near-unity rho hv. Ground measurements from the past OWLeS campaign provide direct evidence that conical graupel may strongly affect these polarimetric measurements in LES bands. Aggregation efficiencies for SS cases are estimated by optimizing the theoretical number concentration (Nt) and mean volume diameter (Dm) steady-state vertical profiles against radar-retrieved profiles derived from 20 of the 25 synoptic storm RD-QVPs. The median estimated aggregation efficiency is approximately 0.15 with a relatively narrow interquartile range that spans from 0.1 to just over 0.2. Values of optimized aggregation efficiencies are nearly independent of the assumed gamma distribution shape parameter. These results are used to derive temperature-dependent, climatological steady-state relations for vertical profiles of Nt, Dm, and liquid-equivalent snowfall rates. These results can be used in numerical weather prediction model aggregation parameterizations and can also provide climatologically representative vertical profiles of radar and microphysical quantities. This study documents the climatology of the vertical profiles of polarimetric radar variables and microphysical parameters in synoptic snow (SS) and lake effect snow (LES) using polarimetric radars in the U.S. The SS vertical profiles show a generally enhanced signal from cloud top to the surface and a noticeable dendritic growth layer signature near -15 degrees C. As for LES vertical profiles, we noticed a negative ZDR pattern with strong Z and weak KDP signals. Further investigation reveals the existence of conical graupel that caused negative ZDR near ground level. This study also summarizes estimated aggregation efficiencies for the SS cases. It shows that the aggregation efficiencies are nearly independent of the commonly used gamma distribution shape parameter. Equations are derived for representing parameters and vertical profiles resulting from aggregation. The overall work from this study provides climatologically representative vertical profiles of radar and microphysical quantities, and can be used as a reference for model parameterization improvement. Climatological vertical profiles of synoptic snow and lake effect snow are summarized using polarimetric radars Lake effect snow exhibits negative values of ZDR which are caused by conical graupel Synoptic snow aggregation efficiencies are estimated by combining radar climatology with theoretical relations						Dunnavan - NOAA Affiliate, Edwin/0000-0001-8568-7048													2169-897X	2169-8996				SEP 28	2024	129	18							e2024JD041318	10.1029/2024JD041318	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024JD041318													WOS:001310800400001

Based on the daily precipitation data in Hunan Province from 1961 to 2021, the regional heavy snowfall processes are classified by using the synoptic diagnostic method. In addition, the water vapor transport characteristics of typical heavy snowfall processes are analyzed by the hybrid single-particle Lagrangian integrated trajectory (HYSPLIT) air mass backward trajectory model. Then, the responses of the differences in water vapor transport to heavy snowfall under different weather situations are discussed. The results show that the spatial distribution of climatic mean heavy snowfall days in Hunan Province is extremely uneven, and the heavy snowfall days decrease from north to south, with the most in the Dongting Lake area and the least in the Nanling Mountains. In the past decades, snowstorms mainly occur in local areas, and there are fewer widespread snowstorms. The frequency of heavy snowfall days generally shows a decreasing trend, with three peaks all appearing before 1990. After the 2010s, the number of days and stations of heavy snowfall decreased noticeably, and so did the number of regional heavy snowfall processes. This result indicates that global warming has remarkable effects on the snowstorm events in Hunan Province. Heavy snowfall mainly occurs from December to February, and peaks from mid-January to early February. Over the past 61 years, more than 50% of heavy snowstorm events occurred after 2000. According to the main weather systems affecting regional heavy snowfall processes, these weather processes in Hunan Province can be classified into three categories: southern branch trough (SBT) type, blocking high collapse (BHC) type, and stepped trough type. Among them, the SBT type accounts for more than 60% of the heavy snowfall events in Hunan. In terms of the SBT type and the stepped trough type, the water vapor from the high-latitude inland and low-latitude sea surface accounts for a comparable proportion, each accounting for nearly 50%. For the SBT type, the proportion of the water vapor from warm-humid airflows is slightly higher than that from cold-humid airflows. However, in terms of the stepped trough type, the water vapor transported by cold-humid airflows from the north contributes more than that by warm-humid airflows. For the BHC type, the specific humidity and the water vapor from the high-latitude inland contribute 70% of heavy snowfall processes. In addition, the contribution of the two southwesterly water vapor channels to heavy snowfall processes is small. The water vapor sources differ remarkably for different heavy snowfall types, but all of them are dominated by the water vapor transport in the middle and lower troposphere, which is the main reason why the formation of snowfall areas under different weather types is obviously different.

This study employs an integrated approach, combining lithofacies analysis, sequence stratigraphy and high-resolution paleoenvironmental reconstruction, to investigate the factors governing organic matter accumulation and to identify prospective exploration targets. Previous studies, supported by sedimentary and geochemical evidence, classify the Da'anzhai Member as a nonmarine lacustrine deposit, which is further categorised into three facies associations: marginal, shallow and semi-deep lacustrine. These are differentiated based on a combination of sedimentary structures formed by wave- and current-generated structures, fossil assemblages and lithological variations, all of which reflect differences in depositional energy and water depth relative to the wave base. A third-order sequence stratigraphic framework was established comprising four systems tracts: Highstand Systems Tract 1 (HST1), Transgressive Systems Tract (TST), Highstand Systems Tract 2 (HST2) and Falling Stage Systems Tract (FSST). Within this framework, paleoenvironmental conditions evolved in response to changing climatic and hydrological regimes. Geochemical proxies revealed a transition from a relatively arid, shallow, and brackish lacustrine environment during HST1 to a deeper, fresher and highly productive anoxic lake during the TST, which peaked at the Maximum Flooding Surface (MFS). This was succeeded by complex highstand deposition (HST2), followed by a return to shallower, more evaporative conditions during the FSST. The entire sequence was interpreted as a terrestrial basin's response to the global Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (T-OAE, similar to 183 Ma). This allocyclic climate-forced model suggests that the initial lacustrine transgression was driven by an intensified hydrological cycle associated with peak T-OAE warming, whereas the ensuing regression during the FSST corresponds to the global climate system's recovery phase. This climate-driven model has significant implications for hydrocarbon exploration in lacustrine shale systems. This climate-forced model has direct implications for hydrocarbon exploration. The primary geological 'sweet spots' were concentrated around the MFS, corresponding to peak transgressive conditions with optimal organic matter preservation. However, the most favourable engineering sweet spots were found at the TST/HST2 boundary. These zones provide an optimal balance of high organic content and improved fracability, resulting from lower concentrations of ductile calcite and higher concentrations of brittle minerals such as quartz and feldspar. Collectively, the integrated sequence-stratigraphic and palaeoenvironmental framework developed in this study not only refines understanding of the depositional history of the Da'anzhai Member but also provides a strategic basis for identifying high-potential intervals for hydrocarbon production in climatically controlled lacustrine shale systems.					li, minglong/HLX-0637-2023														0072-1050	1099-1034				2025 SEP 24	2025										10.1002/gj.70054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/gj.70054		SEP 2025											WOS:001579125200001

The interconnected evolutionary history of algae and bacteria allowed the formation of a wide spectrum of associations defined by orchestrated nutrient exchange, mutual support with growth factors, quorum sensing mediation, and episodic killing of the partners to obtain more resources. In this review, we discuss how these cross-kingdom interactions shape plankton communities that undergo annual, seasonal switching between alternative states with balanced multispecies consortia. We illustrate how these microscopic interactions can have consequences that scale up to influence global element cycling.

The Fennoscandian population of Anser erythropus (Lesser White-fronted Goose) is among the most endangered bird populations in Europe, with only 25-30 breeding pairs remaining in Northern Norway. Historically, its former breeding range extended across the mountainous regions of Fennoscandia. Thanks to targeted conservation efforts during the 21st century, A. erythropus has started to recolonize some of its former breeding areas in Norway and possibly also in Finland. Anser serrirostris rossicus (Tundra Bean Goose) is classified as Endangered in Finland, with just a few breeding pairs in northernmost Finnish Lapland with a poorly known breeding range. It breeds in higher numbers in Finnmark Norway and is listed as Vulnerable in Norway. Anser fabalis fabalis (Taiga Bean Goose), classified as Endangered in Norway, can also breed in the same area in low numbers. To locate individuals of these elusive goose species during breeding seasons, we used environmental DNA (eDNA) extracted from filtered lake water from selected lakes in northern Finland. We amplified and sequenced a short region of the mitochondrial control region to identify the species. Additionally, for positive controls, we sampled eDNA from the water of a Finnish spring staging site and known Norwegian breeding sites of the A. erythropus, from which eDNA of the A. erythropus was identified. eDNA of the A. erythropus was not detected within the former Finnish breeding range. Based on this, the A. erythropus has either not recolonized its former breeding habitats in Finland, the correct lakes were not sampled, the eDNA concentration was below detection limits, or due to other methodological issues. Anser s. rossicus was detected in 3 lakes and A. f. fabalis in 10 lakes, providing new information about the breeding distribution of Bean Geese in Finnish Lapland. center dot We aimed to locate elusive goose species from Northernmost Finnish Lapland using environmental DNA (eDNA) traces geese leave behind in waterbodies, such as DNA from feces or dead skin cells.center dot We used water samples to locate individuals of the critically endangered Fennoscandian Anser erythropus (Lesser White-fronted Goose) population.center dot We used water samples to also locate Anser serrirostris rossicus (Tundra Bean Goose), whose breeding range in Finland is poorly known, and found it in 3 lakes.center dot We also detected eDNA of Anser fabalis fabalis (Taiga Bean Goose) in 10 lakes in northern Finland.center dot Our study offers new insights into the breeding range of Bean Geese in Finland and the efficiency of eDNA methodology.center dot We did not find any A. erythropus eDNA in potential breeding sites, even though this bird had possibly expanded its range to Finland.

Detectar especies raras y elusivas en grandes & aacute;reas silvestres plantea desaf & iacute;os significativos. La poblaci & oacute;n fenoscandiana de Anser erythropus se encuentra entre las aves m & aacute;s amenazadas de Europa, con solo 25-30 parejas reproductoras en el norte de Noruega. Hist & oacute;ricamente, su & aacute;rea de reproducci & oacute;n se extend & iacute;a por las regiones monta & ntilde;osas de Fenoscandia. Gracias a esfuerzos de conservaci & oacute;n espec & iacute;ficos durante el siglo XXI, A. erythropus ha comenzado a recolonizar algunas de sus antiguas & aacute;reas de reproducci & oacute;n en Noruega y posiblemente tambi & eacute;n en Finlandia. Anser serrirostris rossicus est & aacute; clasificada como En Peligro en Finlandia, con solo unas pocas parejas reproductoras en el norte de la Laponia finlandesa, con un & aacute;rea de reproducci & oacute;n poco conocida. A su vez se reproduce en mayor n & uacute;mero en Finnmark, Noruega, y est & aacute; clasificada como Vulnerable en Noruega. Anser fabalis fabalis, clasificada como En Peligro en Noruega, tambi & eacute;n puede reproducirse en la misma & aacute;rea en n & uacute;meros reducidos. Para localizar individuos de estas especies elusivas de gansos durante las temporadas de reproducci & oacute;n, utilizamos ADN ambiental (ADNa) extra & iacute;do del agua de lagos seleccionados en el norte de Finlandia. Amplificamos y secuenciamos una regi & oacute;n corta de la regi & oacute;n de control mitocondrial para identificar las especies. Adem & aacute;s, como controles positivos, recolectamos ADNa del agua de un sitio de parada de primavera en Finlandia y de sitios de reproducci & oacute;n conocidos de A. erythropus en Noruega, donde se identific & oacute; ADNa de esta especie. No se detect & oacute; ADNa de A. erythropus en su antigua & aacute;rea de reproducci & oacute;n en Finlandia. Con base en esto, concluimos que A. erythropus no ha recolonizado sus antiguos h & aacute;bitats de reproducci & oacute;n en Finlandia, los lagos correctos no fueron muestreados, la concentraci & oacute;n de ADNa estaba por debajo de los l & iacute;mites de detecci & oacute;n o hubo otros problemas metodol & oacute;gicos.

Here we present a chironomid record from Bergsee covering ca. 35 thousands of years (kyr) including the period corresponding to the Last Glacial Maximum in the northern Alpine area. The record is divided into 6 biostratigraphical zones. Between ca. 45.4-30.1 thousand calibrated 14C years (cal ka BP) taxa typical for the littoral of relatively warm lakes (Parakiefferiella bathophilatype and Paratanytarsus penicillatus-type) are dominating. Then (ca. 30.1-23.3 cal ka BP), Sergentia coracina-type, a profundal and cold indicative taxon, becomes dominant alongside Parakiefferiella bathophila-type. Low diversity and high abundances of Sergentia coracina-type suggest the most severe environmental conditions of the record. The third zone (ca. 23.3-20.6 cal ka BP) is largely dominated by Parakiefferiella bathophila-type and warmer indicative taxa replace Sergentia coracina-type. In the fourth zone (ca. 20.6-16.9 cal ka BP), Paratanytarsus penicillatus-type and Tanytarsus pallidicornis-type dominate and the presence of Chironomus anthracinus-type suggests slightly warmer conditions, more nutrients or organic matter and lower oxygen availability in the lake. In the next zone (ca. 16.9-10.7 cal ka BP), Corynocera ambigua, a taxon with uncertain distribution in respect to temperature, becomes the dominant chironomid. Changing abundances of Corynocera ambigua match the climate variability of the Lateglacial, with high abundances corresponding to the cold phases of the Oldest and Younger Dryas interrupted by the warmer B & Oslash;lling/Aller & Oslash;d interstadial. However, the high abundances of Corynocera ambigua are not necessarily due to colder temperature but could also be explained by changes in the trophic conditions in the lake or other environmental changes. The last zone (ca. 10.7-8.4 cal ka BP, onset of the Holocene), shows the highest diversity and presence of warm indicative taxa such as Endochironomus tendens-type and Polypedilum nubeculosum-type. The high abundances of Corynocera ambigua make the temperature reconstruction challenging for the Lateglacial since this taxon is restricted to cold lakes in some European chironomidtemperature calibration datasets, whereas it is known that it can also be found in high abundances in warmer lakes in other calibration datasets. A chironomid-temperature transfer function based on a Swiss-Norwegian calibration dataset reconstructed exceptionally cold values in the interval with maximum abundances of Corynocera ambigua, which disagree with reconstructions from other palaeoenvironmental archives in the region. To address this problem, the Swiss-Norwegian model was also used excluding Corynocera ambigua and another calibration dataset (Finnish), having a more realistic temperature optimum for Corynocera ambigua, was applied to the Bergsee chironomid record to evaluate the results. The reconstructions with the Swiss-Norwegian calibration dataset excluding Corynocera ambigua and with the Finnish calibration dataset resulted in a more realistic temperature development for the Lateglacial at Bergsee. The reconstructions based on these datasets indicate temperatures of ca. 11.6 degrees C for the period 45-30.1 cal ka BP, the coldest phase between 30.1 and 23.3 cal ka BP with July air temperature of ca. 10. 5 degrees C, an abrupt warming at the beginning of the B & Oslash;lling interstadial to ca. 16 degrees C and a decrease to 12.2 degrees C during the Younger Dryas. Another warming of 3.7 degrees C is estimated after the Younger Dryas and reconstructed temperatures reached ca. 16.4 degrees C in the Early Holocene. However, inferred temperatures in this range may already have been affected by the edge effect that can lead to underestimated temperatures close to the maximum temperatures covered by calibration datasets. The timing of the coldest phase is consistent with reconstructions of the expansion and maximum extent of northern Alpine glaciers, the pollen record from Bergsee and other palaeoenvironmental records in the region.					; Lapellegerie, Pierre/JXX-9817-2024; Millet, Laurent/F-8730-2014; Heiri, Oliver/JCE-4598-2023	Luoto, Tomi/0000-0001-6925-3688; Heiri, Oliver/0000-0002-3957-5835; Lapellegerie, Pierre/0009-0006-8745-9261; 													0277-3791	1873-457X				DEC 1	2024	345								109016	10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.109016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.109016		OCT 2024											WOS:001348130000001

Species may cope with temperature increases by shifting their seasonality or their depth to track suitable thermal habitats, but these responses may be constrained by ecological interactions, life histories or limiting resources. Here we use 32 million temperature measurements from 139 lakes to quantify thermal habitat change (percentage of non-overlap) and assess how this change is exacerbated by potential habitat constraints. Long-term temperature change resulted in an average 6.2% non-overlap between thermal habitats in baseline (1978-1995) and recent (1996-2013) time periods, with non-overlap increasing to 19.4% on average when habitats were restricted by season and depth. Tropical lakes exhibited substantially higher thermal non-overlap compared with lakes at other latitudes. Lakes with high thermal habitat change coincided with those having numerous endemic species, suggesting that conservation actions should consider thermal habitat change to preserve lake biodiversity. Using measurements from 139 global lakes, the authors demonstrate how long-term thermal habitat change in lakes is exacerbated by species' seasonal and depth-related constraints. They further reveal higher change in tropical lakes, and those with high biodiversity and endemism.					; Timofeyev, Maxim/F-2071-2010; ROGORA, MICHELA/IZD-8951-2023; Leavitt, Peter/A-1048-2013; Hambright, Karl/D-4086-2012; Lepori, Fabio/F-8966-2012; Sommaruga, Ruben/P-6626-2019; Johnk, Klaus/B-3382-2008; Hessen, Dag Olav/AFI-5448-2022; Straile, Dietmar/A-4065-2008; Sadro, Steven/AGC-7944-2022; Devlin, Shawn/C-3426-2011; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/Y-6135-2019; ROGORA, MICHELA/B-9237-2008; Schmid, Martin/C-3953-2009; Silow, Eugene/C-2958-2011; Thiery, Wim/AAJ-6692-2021; Higgins, Scott/F-5700-2016; Hessen, Dag/AFI-5448-2022; Dokulil, Martin/J-3464-2019; Kraemer, Benjamin/AAV-9299-2021; Maberly, Stephen/J-3361-2012; Jöhnk, Klaus/B-3382-2008; Sommaruga, Ruben/E-5335-2011; Salmaso, Nico/O-8968-2015; Montero, William/ABG-7984-2020; Gaiser, Evelyn/ABG-2507-2020	Ban, Syuhei/0000-0002-7168-5583; Knoll, Lesley/0000-0003-0347-5979; Thiery, Wim/0000-0002-5183-6145; Pilla, Rachel/0000-0001-9156-9486; Johnk, Klaus/0000-0002-5972-4201; Hessen, Dag Olav/0000-0002-0154-7847; Richardson, David/0000-0001-9374-9624; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/0000-0002-4013-2281; ROGORA, MICHELA/0000-0003-3515-0220; Schmid, Martin/0000-0001-8699-5691; Colom Montero, William/0000-0002-2035-2498; Sadro, Steven/0000-0002-6416-3840; Silow, Eugene/0000-0002-7039-3220; Lepori, Fabio/0000-0002-6438-9452; verburg, piet/0000-0001-7574-9161; Dokulil, Martin/0000-0002-6369-1457; Hambright, K.

Due to the climate warming, permafrost degradation on the QTP has been widely recorded in the past decades. Since it greatly affects the East Asian monsoon, and even the global climate system, it is extremely important to understand permafrost current state, changes and its impacts. Based on literature reviews and some new data, this paper summarizes the characteristics of the current state permafrost on the QTP, including the active layer thickness (ALT), the spatial distribution of permafrost, permafrost temperature and thickness, as well as the ground ice and soil carbon storage in permafrost region. The new results showed that the permafrost and seasonally frozen ground area (excluding glaciers and lakes) is 1.06 million square kilometers and 1.45 million square kilometers on the QTP. The sub-stable, transitional, and unstable permafrost accounts for 30.4%, 22.1% and 22.6% of the total permafrost area. The permafrost thickness varies greatly among topography, with the maximum value in mountainous areas, which could be deeper than 200 m, while the minimum value in the flat areas and mountain valleys, which could be less than 60 m. The mean active layer thickness of the permafrost on the QTP is 2.3 m, with 80% of the permafrost regions ranges from 0.8 m to 3.5 m. During 1980 to 2015, soil temperature at 0-10, 10-40, 40-100, 100-200 cm increased at a rate of 0.439, 0.449, 0.396, and 0.259 degrees C/10 a, respectively. From 2004 to 2018, the increasing rate of the soil temperature at the bottom of active layer was 0.486 degrees C/10 a. These results show that the permafrost degradation has been accelerating. The permafrost degradation largely reduces the soil moisture. The ground ice volume of the permafrost is estimated up to 1.27x10(4) km(3) (liquid water equivalent). The soil organic carbon in the upper 2 m of permafrost region is about 17 Pg; there is a large uncertainty in this estimation however due to the great heterogeneities in the soil column. Although the permafrost ecosystem is a carbon sink at the present, it is possible that it will shift to a carbon source due to the loss of soil organic carbon along with permafrost degradation. Overall, this paper shows that the plateau permafrost has undergone remarkable degradation during past decades, which are clearly proven by the increasing ALTs and ground temperature. Most of the permafrost on the QTP belongs to the unstable permafrost, meaning that permafrost over TPQ is very sensitive to climate warming. The permafrost interacts closely with water, soil, greenhouse gases emission and biosphere. Therefore, the permafrost degradation greatly affects the regional hydrology, ecology and even the global climate system. This paper also proposes approaches and methods to study the interactive mechanisms between permafrost and climate change, and the results can serve as a scientific basis for environmental protection, engineering design and construction in cold regions.

It has impeded progress towards sustainable development goals (SDGs) by threatening 20% of irrigated areas. However, in many data-poor regions, accurate soil salinization information is unavailable. Thus, an updated soil salinity map with high accuracy and resolution is urgently needed to help local governments conduct precise management. In this study, a bootstrap hybrid machine learning framework was developed combine Sentinel-2 data and environmental covariates. The Boruta algorithm was applied to input the spectral information and environmental variables to identify the primary factors influencing soil salinity. By averaging 100 model iterations within a bootstrap framework, the soil salinity mapping outcomes were compared from four machine learning methods (bagging, classification and regression tree, random forest, and gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT)). The results showed that the models driven by spectral information and environmental covariates (strategy II) explained 68~88% of the variability in soil salinity. The model accuracy of strategy II was improved by 5%-8% over that of the models driven only by spectral information (strategy I). The GBRT yielded the most appropriate averaging performance of the four machine learning approaches within strategy II, with an R-2 of 0.88, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.33 dS m(-1) , a ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) of 4.66 and model stability (ROB) of 0.44. The bootstrap averaging method was relatively stable and had high accuracy potential. The distribution of soil salinity in the Ebinur Lake region was the result of a combination of natural and human activity influences. The proposed approach provides a soil salinity mapping strategy with a fine resolution (10 m) and high accuracy in data-poor places. It may also aid in the restoration of biodiversity, the decrease in land degradation, and the avoidance of future food output reductions in the future.					; He, baozhong/HIK-1137-2022; Ge, Xiangyu/AFB-6602-2022; Jin, Xiaoye/ITU-0574-2023; Wang, Jingzhe/Q-4555-2019	Ge, Xiangyu/0000-0001-7855-6525; Han, Lijing/0000-0002-8222-2664; Teng, Dexiong/0000-0001-8742-230X; Wang, Jingzhe/0000-0001-8332-7997; 													0341-8162	1872-6887				MAY	2022	212								106054	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106054		FEB 2022											WOS:000790434500002

Therefore, it is important to examine the levels and distribution of phthalates in multimedia environment. This study investigated the seasonal and spatial variation of 14 PEs in air, water, sediments, and fish in the Asan Lake. Asan Lake is one of the largest artificial lakes in Korea, and is surrounded by industrial complex and farmlands. The PEs were found to be present throughout the study area. The mean concentration of total PEs (Sigma(14) PEs) was 3.92-33.09 ng/m(3) in air, not detected (n.d.)-2.29 mu g/L in water, 3.6-8973 mu g/kg dry weight (dw) in sediment, and n.d.-1081 mu g/kg dw in fish, respectively. The most frequently detected phthalate in the samples was di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and followed by di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP). The concentrations of PEs in water and sediment samples tended to decrease moving downstream of Asan Lake. Bioaccumulation of PEs showed that benthic feeding fish such as crucian carp or skygager contained higher levels of DEHP. Partitioning of DEHP and DBP between water and sediment was calculated using paired sediment/water samples and fugacity fraction (ff). High ff value (ff = 0.89 +/- 0.1) of DBP and low ff value of DEHP (ff = 0.24 +/- 0.1) confirmed that DEHP is the most abundant PEs in the sediment, and DBP is the second most abundant PEs except DEHP in water. Our results can provide important information of the distribution and behavior of PEs in the lake environment.

J	Yin, HB; Zhang, M; Yin, P; Li, JY				Yin, Hongbin; Zhang, Man; Yin, Peng; Li, Jiying			Characterization of internal phosphorus loading in the sediment of a large eutrophic lake (Lake Taihu, China)	WATER RESEARCH												Lake Taihu suffers from severe algal blooms every year, which is attributed primarily to the release of sediment phosphorus (P), namely the internal P loading. However, the overall internal P loading and the P hotspots in sediment have not been fully studied. This paper presents several methods, including sequential P extraction, the use of diffusive gradient in thin film (DGT), and intact core incubation to give a detailed investigation of sedi-ment internal P loading as well as its roles in algal dominated zones (ADZs) and grass dominated zones (GDZs) in Lake Taihu. Sediment microbial composition was also analyzed to investigate its relationship with P fractions. The results indicate that the total P and the mobile P fraction in the ADZ sediments are generally higher than those of the GDZ sediments. The percentage of sediment mobile P to TP is similar to the mobile P in their dis-tributions. In contrast, calcium bound P accounts for most of the TP in GDZ, while mobile P contributes the most to TP in ADZ. Overall, sediment can release 256 tons of TP and 217 tons of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) over a period of six months in the warmer seasons. Similarly, a high concentration of DGT-measured P was observed in ADZs that are recognized as P hotspots in Lake Taihu. Sediments in ADZ and GDZ was dominated by the bacteria Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, respectively and which were closely related with mobile P and calcium bound P in sediment, respectively. GZD seems to be able to retain more P in sediments, thereby reducing its contribution to of internal P loading. These results indicate that the difference in sediment composition between ADZ and GDZ affects their roles in sediment internal P loading, therefore, different management strategies should be used to combat sediment internal P loads in the two zones.

J	Rajeshkumar, S; Li, XY				Rajeshkumar, Sivakumar; Li, Xiaoyu			Bioaccumulation of heavy metals in fish species from the Meiliang Bay, Taihu Lake, China	TOXICOLOGY REPORTS												In the present study, the bioaccumulation of heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Cd, Pb) content were determined in freshwater edible fishes Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus and Pelteobagrus fluvidraco, which were caught from the Meiliang Bay, Taihu Lake, a large, shallow and eutrophic lake of China. The results showed that the Cr, Cu, Cd and Pb content in the edible parts of the two fish species were much lower than Chinese Food Health Criterion (1994). However, the results showed marked differences in the four analyzed metal content between the two species and different tissues as well as significant variations. Pb content were the highest in the liver of fishes, Cd contents were almost the same in all organs of fishes, Cr contents mainly enriched in the kidney and liver, Cu contents were the highest in gills, However, the total metal bioaccumulation were greatest in the liver, gills and the lowest in the muscle. Although the total accumulations were highest in P. fluvidraco compare then C.carpio. This investigation indicated that fish products in Meiliang Bay, Taihu Lake were still safe for human consumption, but the amount consumed should be controlled under the Chinese Food Health Criterion to avoid excessive intake of Pb. Further, this is the first report on seasonal distribution of heavy metals and proximate compositions of commercialized important edible fishes from Meiliang Bay, Taihu Lake, China.

Global change-driven effects on dissolved organic matter composition: Implications for food webs of northern lakes	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Northern ecosystems are experiencing some of the most dramatic impacts of global change on Earth. Rising temperatures, hydrological intensification, changes in atmospheric acid deposition and associated acidification recovery, and changes in vegetative cover are resulting in fundamental changes in terrestrial-aquatic biogeochemical linkages. The effects of global change are readily observed in alterations in the supply of dissolved organic matter (DOM)-the messenger between terrestrial and lake ecosystems-with potentially profound effects on the structure and function of lakes. Northern terrestrial ecosystems contain substantial stores of organic matter and filter or funnel DOM, affecting the timing and magnitude of DOM delivery to surface waters. This terrestrial DOM is processed in streams, rivers, and lakes, ultimately shifting its composition, stoichiometry, and bioavailability. Here, we explore the potential consequences of these global change-driven effects for lake food webs at northern latitudes. Notably, we provide evidence that increased allochthonous DOM supply to lakes is overwhelming increased autochthonous DOM supply that potentially results from earlier ice-out and a longer growing season. Furthermore, we assess the potential implications of this shift for the nutritional quality of autotrophs in terms of their stoichiometry, fatty acid composition, toxin production, and methylmercury concentration, and therefore, contaminant transfer through the food web. We conclude that global change in northern regions leads not only to reduced primary productivity but also to nutritionally poorer lake food webs, with discernible consequences for the trophic web to fish and humans.					; Kidd, Karen A/ABG-3237-2020; Berggren, Martin/G-1401-2012; Kortelainen, Pirkko/AAN-7045-2020; Hessen, Dag Olav/AFI-5448-2022; Ask, Jenny/AGL-6833-2022; Grimm, Nancy/D-2840-2009; Cherif, Mehdi/B-2598-2013; Creed, Irena/L-8810-2013; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/Y-6135-2019; Kidd, Karen/ABG-3237-2020; Hessen, Dag/AFI-5448-2022; Vrede, Tobias/C-1956-2015	Cherif, Mehdi/0000-0003-0107-9374; Kidd, Karen A/0000-0002-5619-1358; Berggren, Martin/0000-0003-0657-0971; Hotchkiss, Erin/0000-0001-6132-9107; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/0000-0002-4013-2281; Bergstrom, Ann-Kristin/0000-0001-5102-4289; Freeman, Erika/0000-0001-7161-6038; Kortelainen, Pirkko/0000-0002-1448-0688; Hessen, Dag Olav/0000-0002-0154-7847; Ask, Jenny/0000-0003-2156-4908; Grimm, Nancy/0000-0001-9374-660X; Creed, Irena/0000-0001-8199-1472; Vrede, Tobias/0000-0001-8235-9890													1354-1013	1365-2486				AUG	2018	24	8					3692	3714		10.1111/gcb.14129	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14129								29543363					WOS:000437284700035

Multiple statistical methods and the water quality index (WQI) were used to assess overall condition and detect spatiotemporal patterns of water quality in a series of impounded lakes along the Eastern Route of China's South-to-North Water Diversion Project. Principal components analysis and analysis of variances identified three groups with distinct water quality characteristics: upstream Gaoyou Lake and Hongze Lake showing relatively higher nutrients, turbidity, and total suspended solids; downstream Dongping lake and Donghu Lake showing higher conductivity, total hardness, and chloride; and Luoma Lake and Nansi Lake intermediate between the two former groups. The WQI indicated overall "Good" water quality with an improving trend from upstream to downstream lakes. The upstream Gaoyou Lake had over 55% of the monitoring sites with "Moderate" water quality in all the seasons. Management should focus on preventing high nitrogen, phosphorus, turbidity, and total suspended solids in upstream lakes, high chloride in downstream lakes, high nitrogen during water diversion seasons, and high phosphorus during non-water diversion seasons. These findings greatly improved our understanding of the spatiotemporal water quality patterns of the impounded lakes, and can be used to develop water quality management strategies. This study exemplifies a methodology for investigating and securing water quality for inter-basin water transfer projects. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Sambhar Lake a wetland - An assessment	Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on the Ecological Importance of Solar Saltworks					1st International Conference on the Ecological Importance of Solar Saltworks	OCT 20-22, 2006	Santorini Isl, GREECE					Sambhar Lake, one of the largest inland saline depressions in western desert of India was declared a Ramsar site in 1990 due to its biological and biotic importance. It is situated west of Jaipur, Rajasthan, and this salt lake forms a vast saline wetland, which constitute the most important area for the flamingos outside Rann of Kutch. In 1982-83, over 5 lakhs flamingos were counted in addition a large number of Pelicans. Despite its importance, water fowl habitat, Sambhar is known as a source of salt producing 2.5 lakh MT annually by Government sector and over 15 lakh to 20 lakh MT in private sector by sub-soil brine by making bore wells. Due to depression in the middle, the water collected there and three processes such as percolation, evaporation and salt production are being carried out in this lake. In 1985 and in 1992, a flood like situation in Sambhar, which resulted in increasing the fishery resources, and later the resources were threatened due to increase in brine density and had no commercial value. With an increase in density, the periphery of the salt lake was exploited for salt production and bittern was discharged into lake and the quality of salt has decrease. It was the original status of Sambhar Lake because of the perpetual drought condition; most of the rivers have filled with sand due to wind action. The following factors have been attributed for the threatening of wetland ecosystem of Sambhar lake: - (1) The path of the fresh water has been restricted. (2) Because of the drought, the Government made a policy to stop the water flow by making checked dams and anicuts for agriculture or to improve water table for water harvesting. Because of this, the water flow to the lake was completely stopped from the catchments area. (3) With the low rainfall, percolation became lesser and sub-soil brine reached 18 to 24 Be. (4) When the lake is filled with the rainwater, the fresh water gets percolated in the subsoil resulted in salinity gradient and conversion of rainwater into high-density brine takes place. (5) Dead algae in the brine contributed to the total organic carbon in the salt. To revive the present condition, the rainwater should reach to the lake from the catchments area. However, during summer, the lake will completely become dry and the salt deposited In the lakebed will also be dried. In Rajasthan, in that particular area, there is lot of gale, storms, and heavy stormy wind during the month of May & June, which will take the salt through wind to nearby area, and that area will also become salty. These observations are discussed in the light of available field data on Sambhar salt lake.																					978-960-86638-2-4				2006							38	43																WOS:000243968500005

Subglacial lakes and their changing role in a warming climate	NATURE REVIEWS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT												Subglacial lakes modify glacial conditions and flow. This Review provides a first global inventory of subglacial lakes, as well as outlining their settings, impacts and potential changes with climate warming. Subglacial lakes are repositories of ancient climate conditions, provide habitats for life and modulate ice flow, basal hydrology, biogeochemical fluxes and geomorphic activity. In this Review, we construct the first global inventory of subglacial lakes (773 in total), which includes 675 from Antarctica (59 newly identified), 64 from Greenland, 2 beneath the Devon Ice Cap, 6 beneath Iceland's ice caps and 26 from valley glaciers. This inventory is used to evaluate subglacial lake environments, dynamics and their wider impact on ice flow and sediment transport. The behaviour of these lakes is conditioned by their subglacial setting and the hydrological, dynamic and mass balance regime of the overlying ice mass. Regions where climate warming causes ice surface steepening are predicted to have fewer and smaller lakes, but increased activity with higher discharge drainages of shorter duration. Coupling to surface melt and rainfall inputs will modulate fill-drain cycles and seasonally enhance oxic processes. Higher discharges cause large, transient ice flow accelerations but might result in overall net slowdown owing to the development of efficient subglacial drainage. Subglacial lake research requires new drilling technologies and the integration of geophysics, satellite monitoring and numerical modelling to provide insight into the wider role of subglacial lakes in the changing Earth system.

NITROGEN IN DRYLAND SOILS OF CHINA AND ITS MANAGEMENT	ADVANCES IN AGRONOMY, VOL 101	Advances in Agronomy											As an essential nutritional element, nitrogen (N) plays extremely important roles in agriculture. It is needed by plants in large amounts while almost all soils worldwide are deficient in this element, resulting in a great gap between its demand and its supply from soil. Application of N fertilizers has strongly helped promote agricultural development for supplying food to man and fodder to animals, and enabled the enormous and unprecedented expansion of the global human population. More than 55% of the increase of crop production in developing countries is from the use of chemical fertilizers with N fertilizers being dominant. China has consumed about 30% of the N fertilizer in the world and this is one of the reasons for the Chinese success to feed 21.8% of the world's population with only 6.8% of the world arable land. However, nitrogen is also an important pollutant. Inputs of large amounts of N fertilizer have brought about many malpractices: low N use efficiency and low N fertilizer recovery have led to low economic returns, and the processes of N behavior such as ammonia volatilization, wet and dry deposition of the volatilized ammonium N to lands and waters, eutrophication in rivers, lakes and sea mouths, nitrate N formation by nitrification and nitrate N leaching, nitrate-N accumulation in water and plants (especially in vegetables), and transformation of nitrate N into N2O, NO, and N2 by denitrification. These processes have exerted a great impact on environmental pollution, ecosystem deterioration, and biodiversity as well as on human health. This situation not only affects agricultural outcome at the present, but will have a major impact on agricultural development in the future. Drylands are a large part of agricultural production areas in China, and the arable lands constitute a large proportion of the total cultivated lands. With the growth of population and the decrease of land and water resources, the drylands become more and more important for the Chinese agricultural development and sustainability. Due to poor plant growth induced by shortage of water supplies, serious wind and water erosion, and low input of fertilizes by farmers, the arable dryland soils in China are low in organic matter (OM) and thus in total N that varies from a minimum of 0.001% to a maximum of 0.178% depending on soil type and environmental conditions. Thus, N deficiency is a major nutritional constraint for crop production. In addition to wind and water erosion that causes organic N loss, nitrogen loss from dryland soils and fertilizers added to soil is mainly in mineral forms. Ammonia volatilization, and nitrate N accumulation in soil profile in and beyond root zones are the major pathway for N loss while denitrification loss is negligible. Despite N deficiency in most of drylands, excessive addition of N fertilizer has occurred in some places and resulted in great attention to the rational management of soil N. For improvement of nitrogen fertilizer recovery (NFR) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) while providing adequate N for crop production, some achievements have been made and various measures have been adopted. Application of N fertilizer with organic fertilizer (OF) can significantly increase the NUE, and at the same time significantly increase crop yield and water use efficiency (WUE). Since N in OF is slowly mineralized, P is too high for plant requirements. Thus, OF should be applied together with N fertilizers, but separately from P fertilizer. In most dryland areas, P deficiency has limited crop production and N fertilizer efficiency, and in some lands even prevented crops from responding to N fertilizer. Combining the use of N fertilizer with P fertilizer can increase NFR and NUE as well as WUE. If N fertilizer is mixed with acid P fertilizer, N loss by volatilization can be reduced. Deep application can place N fertilizer in the layer where more water is available, nutrients are deficient, and more roots are present for efficiently using N from the fertilizer applied and the moisture from the soil in addition reduction of N loss by volatilization, and thus can increase crop yield, and fertilizer use efficiency. Deep application can be conducted with deep plowing so that N fertilizer can be placed in a suitable layer for plant use. In areas without supplemental irrigation, early application of N fertilizer to wheat and other autumn-sown crops should be encouraged while for maize with full irrigation, N fertilizer should be divided into four portions with one portion applied at sowing, one portion at elongation, and two portions before heading. A crop often obtains up 45%-70% of its total N from the soil. Therefore, N fertilizer applications should be made according to the soil nitrogen supplying capacity (SNSC). Several biological and chemical procedures have been used for evaluating the SNSC, yet none of the methods has proven suitable for agricultural practice. A large number of field results demonstrated that the cumulative amount of nitrate N from the 0 to 1 m soil layer was significantly correlated to crop uptake N with a correlation coefficient of 0.908, giving a very satisfactory index of soil availability. Due to high nitrate N accumulated in soil profile, the potentially mineralizable N, estimated by either incubation or chemical reagent extraction, did not show a good correlation. In contrast, in soils with low amounts of nitrate N accumulated in soil profile, some methods for determining mineralizable N did exert a positive role in reflecting the SNSC, having certain potentials for use. Crop responses to N forms depend on soil pH and plant species. In dryland soils, nitrate N is the major form existing in soil and due to high pH buffering capacity, it is also the major form taken up by plants, and the major crops, wheat and maize, have responded better to nitrate N than to ammonium N. Since ammonium-based N fertilizer, particularly urea, is the major form produced by industrial processes, enhancing nitrate nutrition may be difficult for some countries or some regions. For solving this problem, rapid nitrification of ammonium N may be a solution. This can be achieved by pretreating the soil with a small quantity of NH4+-salt before a large amount of urea is applied. For sustainable agriculture and eliminating N fertilizer pollution of the environment, different strategies have been proposed. Roughly, two ways are noted: agricultural and industrial. The former is improvement of crop growing conditions for efficient use of the N fertilizer whereas the latter improvement of N fertilizer characteristics. Of these, agricultural strategies are fundamental and basic. Applying adequate rates of N fertilizer, rotating legumes in cropping sequences, using organic materials in combination with chemical fertilizers, and improving crop health for better use of nutrients are some important aspects for consideration in the future.																			0065-2113	2213-6789	978-0-12-374817-1				2009	101						123	181		10.1016/S0065-2113(08)00803-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0065-2113(08)00803-1													WOS:000264638100003

Approximately 742 new gravity observations, 1276 ground magnetic stations, 30 km of seismic refraction lines, 19 km of seismic reflection lines, 22 magnetotelluric stations, and several Schlumberger and dipole-dipole resistivity lines were established. Our studies provide new information on one boundary of a major continental rift and on the depositional and structural style of an extensional basin within the rift. Integration of these data sets into a single transect indicates that the Espanola Basin is asymmetrical with approximately 2 to 3 km of sediments and sedimentary rocks near the center, thinning eastward to the Precambrian outcrop of the flanking Sangre de Cristo uplift. Several minor faults with throws of less than 200 m were found, but no major eastern bounding fault was observed. Thus, the Espanola Basin could be an asymmetrical, west-dipping half-graben. However, major fault offset, down toward the basin axis, may occur within Precambrian rocks of the Sangre de Cristo uplift. In either case, the geometry of the basin does not agree well with current models for the structural evolution of continental rifts, which emphasize low-angle detachment faults which create asymmetrical, hinged half-grabens. These models predict that major shoulder uplift should occur adjacent to the side of the graben bounded by a listric master fault rather than adjacent to the hinged side. In contrast, for the Espanola Basin major uplift occurred adjacent to the eastern side, which could be the hinged side of the basin. A thick wedge of older sedimentary rocks with high P-wave velocity (4.4 km/s) and low electrical resistivity (5-OMEGA.m) was discovered under the younger Tertiary sediments and sedimentary rocks near the center of the basin. This wedge has maximum thickness of 1.2 km at the western end of the profile and thins eastward. The physical properties suggest this layer could be older Tertiary, or possibly a Mesozoic-Paleozoic, section of rocks. If the latter, it has potential economic importance because of the possible presence of a Creaceous section which is known to produce oil and gas in the Albuquerque Basin to the south and the San Luis Basin to the north. However, based on data from the Yates La Mesa no. 2 well, 10 km south of the transect, this wedge is likely middle Tertiary lacustrine deposits (NMOCD, 1986). The great thickness of lake deposits may represent a major lacustrine facies of the Eocene Galisteo and El Rito formations, exposed around the southern, southwestern, and northwestern margins of the basin. Magnetotelluric data suggest the crystalline basement underlying the central Espanola Basin may be more conductive than near the eastern margin. The entire Espanola Basin is also underlain by a highly conductive layer of about 1-OMEGA.m at a depth of 15 km. Both the shallow and deep low-resistivity zones may result from hot, saline fluids. Such fluids deep within the crust may reduce the shear strength of the crust significantly and concentrate crustal extension on the west side of the rift.																			0016-8033					MAR	1991	56	3					340	353		10.1190/1.1443048	http://dx.doi.org/10.1190/1.1443048													WOS:A1991FB28600002

A methodological approach to estimate risks to human health from the use of pesticides in agriculture	Proceeding of the 9th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology Vol B - Poster Presentations	Proceedings of the International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology				9th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology	SEP 01-03, 2005	Rhodes Isl, GREECE	Global Network Environm Sci & Technol, Univ Aegean, Dept Environm Studies				This paper presents a simplified methodology to estimate risks to human health from the consumption of drinking water contaminated with pesticides used in agricultural areas. The methodology was applied to estimate the peak and average (long term) concentrations of pesticides in the waters of Lake Taka, lying south-east of Tripoli, in the municipality of Tegea. The Lake presently dries out in the summer months but plans are underway to restore the Lake to a minimum water volume of 12 million m(3). The Lake lies in the middle of a heavily irrigated agricultural area and has a cathment area of 92 km(2). Data were collected on the meteorological conditions, types of soil, irrigation methods, types and areas of crops, pesticide use, anthropogenic activities and ecosystems. The types, quantities, application rates and application times of pesticides applied to land were recorded. For each pesticide chemical and toxicological data were collected from data banks. An initial risk ranking of pesticides, was done by estimating the peak concentration of each pesticide in the surface runoff from the agricultural land, immediately after its application to crops and in combination with an intense rainfall event (worst case scenario). The loss of pesticide to surface water is caused by spray drift directly on the surface of the water and by leaching due to runoff. Predicted maximum concentrations in surface water exceeded by up to 2 orders of magnitude the limit concentrations for drinking water and by up to 1 order of magnitude the limit for drinking water abstraction. The higher concentrations were predicted for 2-4 D and Glyphosates. For risk ranking, a toxicity score is proposed calculated as the peak concentration divided by a Reference Dose. The pesticide Methamidofos was found to account for more than 93,7% of the total risk, followed by 2-4 D with 1,7%, Dimethoate, MCPA, and Paraquat with 0,8-0,9%. The pesticide Trifluralin was kept in the list as the only carcinogenic substance, although its risk quotient was very small. The average annual concentration of the most toxic pesticides according to the previous classification were estimated taking also into account the decay of pesticide in soil and in Lake water. Ignoring other exposure routes, i.e. consumption of vegetable products contaminated with pesticides or skin contact of farmers during pesticide application and taking into account only long-term life exposure due to drinking water consumption from the water of Lake Taka, it was found that the cumulative risk to human health was non significant. The methodology presented in this paper can serve as a rapid tool for Tier I assessment of ecological and human health risks from pesticides used in agriculture.																			1106-5516		960-7475-33-X				2005							B255	B260																WOS:000237755500042

Invariable selection of compounds from organic matter by stream microbes	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Organic carbon (OC) in rivers is one of the most rapidly recycled carbon pools. A significant proportion of OC is remineralized and contributes to the globally relevant CO2 emissions of river networks. However, there is no consensus on the mechanisms that determine which compounds are remineralized. Previous studies found that OC older than the mean age of the source was decomposed by aquatic microorganisms. Here, we study the radiocarbon (Delta 14C) age of dissolved OC (DOC) that is decomposed in laboratory experiments across a range of stream bulk DOC ages. Stream DOC was collected from small forested catchments under summer dry flow, average flow and storm flow conditions. The decomposed DOC was neither consistently older nor younger than the original stream DOC. The Delta 14C of respiratory CO2 increased with the Delta 14C of stream DOC (P = 0.006, N = 16). However, the slope of the regression was small (0.20 +/- 0.06) and the dependence was weak (R2 = 0.43). Moreover, the age range of respired DOC (modern to 950 years BP) was considerably narrower than the age range of stream DOC (modern to 3880 years BP). In further experiments, we used leachates of catchment soil from 0-8 cm and 8-20 cm depth and a 1:1 mixture of the two depths as initial DOC. Again, the increase in Delta 14CCO2 as a function of Delta 14C-DOC was significant (R2 = 0.74, P = 0.028, N = 6), but the slope was small (0.13 +/- 0.04) and the age range of respired DOC was narrow (modern to 280 years BP) compared to initial leachate DOC (600 to 3400 years BP). Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry showed that the dissolved organic matter (DOM) starting material from the deeper soil layer was characterized by smaller, more reduced (i. e. aliphatic) molecules as compared to the DOM from the shallower soil layer. However, similar (small, unsaturated, oxygen-rich) CHO molecules were consumed regardless of DOM source. The narrow age ranges of respired DOC suggest that intrinsic chemical quality sets the limits for which compounds can be utilized under given geochemical conditions. However, strategies of microorganisms to optimize growth (optimal foraging) may modulate their specific substrate choice, as indicated by the dependence of the age of respired OC on the age composition of the original DOC. Analysis of published decomposition experiments showed that in 60 % of measurements the decomposed OC was older than the original river or lake OC, excluding studies with peat-derived OC or OC affected by permafrost thaw. However, due to the freshwater reservoir effect (photosynthetic assimilation of 14C-old inorganic carbon), existing data provide no consistent evidence that either younger or older OC is preferentially decomposed.

Periodic cyanotoxin production, although undesir-able, may be tolerable when there is enough time for cyanotoxins to degrade and dissipate in the environment, but the year-round presence of these toxins will be a chronic health for humans and ecosystems. The purpose of this critical review is to document the seasonal shifts of algal species and their ecophysiological acclimatation to dynamic environmental conditions. We discuss how these conditions will create successive occurrences of algal blooms and the release of cyanotoxins into freshwater. We first review the most common cyanotoxins, and evaluate the multiple ecological roles and physiological functions of these toxins for algae. Then, the annual recurring patterns HABs are considered in the context of global change, which demonstrates the capacity for algal blooms to shift from seasonal to year-round growth regimes that are driven by abiotic and biotic factors, leading to chronic loading of freshwaters with cyanotoxins. At last, we illustrate the impacts of HABs on the environment by compiling four health issues and four ecology issues emanating from their presence in the that covers atmosphere, aquatic ecosystems and terrestrial ecosystems. Our study highlights the annual patterns of algal blooms, and proposes that a "perfect storm" of events is lurking that will cause the 'seasonal toxicity' to become a full-blown, 'chronic toxicity' in the context of the deterioration of HABs, highlighting a non-negligible chronic health and ecological hazard.

Toward mountains without permanent snow and ice	EARTHS FUTURE												The cryosphere in mountain regions is rapidly declining, a trend that is expected to accelerate over the next several decades due to anthropogenic climate change. A cascade of effects will result, extending from mountains to lowlands with associated impacts on human livelihood, economy, and ecosystems. With rising air temperatures and increased radiative forcing, glaciers will become smaller and, in some cases, disappear, the area of frozen ground will diminish, the ratio of snow to rainfall will decrease, and the timing and magnitude of both maximum and minimum streamflow will change. These changes will affect erosion rates, sediment, and nutrient flux, and the biogeochemistry of rivers and proglacial lakes, all of which influence water quality, aquatic habitat, and biotic communities. Changes in the length of the growing season will allow low-elevation plants and animals to expand their ranges upward. Slope failures due to thawing alpine permafrost, and outburst floods from glacier-and moraine-dammed lakes will threaten downstream populations.Societies even well beyond the mountains depend on meltwater from glaciers and snow for drinking water supplies, irrigation, mining, hydropower, agriculture, and recreation. Here, we review and, where possible, quantify the impacts of anticipated climate change on the alpine cryosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere, and consider the implications for adaptation to a future of mountains without permanent snow and ice.

The current surface water dynamic products from high resolution (HR) multispectral satellite imagery are typically analyzed to determine the annual trend and related seasonal variability. Annual and seasonal time series analyses may fail to detect the infra-annual variations of water bodies. Sentinel-2 allows us to investigate water resources based on both spatial and temporal high-resolution analyses. We propose a new automatic RBSP approach on the Google Earth Engine platform. The RBSP method employs combined spectral indices and superpixel techniques to delineate the surface water extent; this approach avoids the need for training data and benefits large-scale, dynamic and automatic monitoring. We used the proposed RBSP method to process Sentinel-2 monthly composite images covering a two-year period and generate the monthly surface water extent at the national scale, i.e., over France. Annual occurrence maps were further obtained based on the pixel frequency in monthly water maps. The monthly dynamics provided in SWDF products are evaluated by HR satellite-derived water masks at the national scale (JRC GSW monthly water history) and at local scales (over two lakes, i.e., Lake Der-Chantecoq and Lake Orient, and 200 random sampling points). The monthly trends between SWDF and GSW were similar, with a coefficient of 0.94. The confusion matrix-based metrics based on the sample points were 0.885 (producer's accuracy), 0.963 (user's accuracy), 0.932 (overall accuracy) and 0.865 (Matthews correlation coefficient). The annual surface water extents (i.e., permanent and maximum) are validated by two HR satellite image-based water maps and an official database at the national scale and small water bodies (ponds) at the local scale at Loir-et-Cher. The results show that the SWDF results are closely correlated to the previous annual water extents, with a coefficient > 0.950. The SWDF results are further validated for large rivers and lakes, with extraction rates of 0.929 and 0.802, respectively. Also, SWDF exhibits superiority to GSW in small water body extraction (taking 2498 ponds in Loir-et-Cher as example), with an extraction rate improved by approximately 20%. Thus, the SWDF method can be used to study interannual, seasonal and monthly variations in surface water systems. The monthly dynamic maps of SWDF improved the degree of land surface coverage by 25% of France on average compared with GSW, which is the only product that provides monthly dynamics. Further harmonization of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 and the introduction of enhanced cloud detection algorithm can fill some gaps of no-data regions.					yang, Xiucheng/O-4374-2018; Zhu, Zhe/K-3518-2015; Yang, Xiucheng/O-4374-2018; Zhu, Zhe/AAE-9428-2019; Pierre, Grussenmeyer/B-4570-2010; Grussenmeyer, Pierre/B-4570-2010	Zhu, Zhe/0000-0001-8283-6407; Yang, Xiucheng/0000-0001-5134-9614; LEDAUPHIN, Thomas/0000-0001-5299-6039; Grussenmeyer, Pierre/0000-0002-7292-2755													0034-4257	1879-0704				JUL	2020	244								111803	10.1016/j.rse.2020.111803	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.111803													WOS:000532837400006
J	BURGERWIERSMA, T				BURGERWIERSMA, T			PROCHLOROTHRIX-HOLLANDICA - A FILAMENTOUS PROKARYOTIC SPECIES CONTAINING CHLOROPHYLLS-A AND CHLOROPHYLLS-B	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE					11TH SYMP OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOC FOR CYANOPHYTE : CYANOBACTERIA RESEARCH	JUL 30-AUG 10, 1989	MAX PLANCK INST LIMNOL, PLON, GERMANY	INT ASSOC CYANOPHYTE, MAX PLANCK GESELL, DEUT FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCH	MAX PLANCK INST LIMNOL			Prochlorothrix hollandica BURGER-WIERSMA, STAL et MUR 1989 is an oxygenic, photoautotrophic prokaryote containing chlorophylls a and b, and lacking phycobilin pigments (BURGER-WIERSMA et al. 1986). Until the discovery of LEWIN's Prochloron (LEWIN 1976, 1977) the combination of chlorophyll a and b was thought to be restricted to the eukaryotes. Therefore, there has been a lot of debate on the taxonomic position of these chlorophyll a/b containing prokaryotes. However, in 1986 FLORENZANO et al. proposed a new order, the Prochlorales, in the Photobacteria to accomodate these organisms. Consequently, BURGER-WIERSMA et al. (1989) refer to the Prochlorales as oxychlorobacteria. The discovery of the oxychlorobacteria is especially interesting seen in the light of the endosymbiosis theory, where they are good candidates for the role of the progenitors of green chloroplasts. Therefore, we will focus here on the differences and similarities between oxychlorobacteria and cyanobacteria on the one hand, and green chloroplasts on the other hand. The habitat of Prochlorothrix hollandica is comparable to that of cyanobacteria. Thus far, the organism has only been isolated from the freshwater Loosdrecht Lakes, but there is evidence of significant numbers in similar lakes in the Netherlands. The Loosdrecht Lakes system consists of several interconnected lakes and has a total area of about 18 km2. The lakes are 2 m on average, and due to wind action the phytoplankton is mixed over the entire watercolumn. The extinction coefficient for light is high; the 1% light level is found at 60 cm in summer. Prochlorothrix is most abundant in summer when the water temperature is 20-25-degrees-C. This coincides nicely with the optimum curve for temperature which peaks at about 25-degrees-C (BURGER-WIERSMA et al. 1989). P. hollandica was first isolated by micromanipulation into mineral medium FPG (BURGER-WIERSMA et al. 1989). However, the strain can be grown in a range of other mineral media. The morphology of P. hollandica (BURGER-WIERSMA et al. 1989) resembles that of some filamentous cynobacteria, which might be the reason that the strain has been overlooked in mixed phytoplankton assemblies. The number of cells per trichome may add up to one hundred or more. The cells are 0.5-1.5-mu-m wide and 3-10-mu-m long, but unfavorable growth conditions may change both width and length. The ultrastructure of the strain is typically prokaryotic. Like cyanobacteria the cells of P. hollandica have a peptidoglycan layer in their cell wall (JURGENS & BURGER-WIERSMA 1989), the polyhedral bodies are proven to be carboxysomes since they contain high levels of RuBisCO (HAWTHORNTHWAITE & CODD 1988). The thylakoid membranes are located parallel to the cell wall as is often observed in cyanobacteria and never in chloroplasts (BURGER-WIERSMA et al. 1986). However, there is one important difference: the appressed thylakoids. This phenomenon is never found in cyanobacteria, which may be simply due to the steric hindrance of the phycobilisomes. In P. hollandica phycobilisomes, and consequently the steric hindrance, are absent. However, several studies made it plausible that "true stacking" occurs in P. hollandica: 1) the thylakoids show lateral heterogeneity (MILLER et al. 1988), 2) state transitions occur like in green chloroplasts (BURGER-WIERSMA & POST 1989), and 3) phosphorylation occurs more or less like in green chloroplasts (VAN DER STAAY et al. 1989). Pigment analysis revealed that the carotenoid composition in Prochlorothrix is comparable to that of cyanobacteria with beta-carotene and zeaxanthin as the major carotenoids (BURGER-WIERSMA et al. 1986). The chlorophylls are not of the bivinyltype that were observed in the picoplanktonic oxychlorobacterium reported by CHISHOLM et al. (1988). In Prochlorothrix the chlorophyll a/b ratio is 7 to 18 (BURGER-WIERSMA & POST 1989), and this is rather high as compared to that in green chloroplasts, where it usually ranges from 2 to 3. Contrasting to green chloroplasts, this organism increases its chlorophyll a/b ratio when adapting to low light (BURGER-WIERSMA & POST 1989). This might indicate that chlorophyll b in Prochlorothrix is functionally different from that in green chloroplasts. Extracts from thylakoids of Prochlorothrix yielded five chlorophyll-protein complexes; CP1 to CP5 (BULLERJAHN et al. 1987). CP1 and CP4 contained low levels of chlorophyll b. By spectroscopic and immunological methods these complexes could be assigned to photosystem 1 and photosystem 2, respectively. CP2, 3 and 5 contained relatively high levels of chlorophyll b; they may represent the antennae pigment complexes. The chlorophyll a/b ratio in these complexes was 4:1, low as compared to the chlorophyll a/b ratio of 4:3 in light harvesting complexes of photosystem 2 (LHC2) of green chloroplasts. A further difference is that chlorophyll b is not presnet as a trimere in the chlorophyll a/b complexes in Prochlorothrix, whereas it is in the LHC2 of green chloroplasts (MATTHIHS et al. 1989). The different molecular organization of the chlorophyll a/b complex may have consequences for its functioning. The lipid composition of phototrophic organisms is often considered a valuable tool in taxonomy and phylogeny. In Prochlorothrix the overall lipid composition is very similar to that of cyanobacteria. The organism lacks the trans-16:1-omega-13 fatty acid, which is restricted almost exclusively to the chloroplast phospholipids of eukaryotic microalgae, and is thought to be closely associated with the stacking of thylakoid membranes (VOLKMAN et al. 1988). Based on 16S ribosomal RNA sequence homology Prochlorothrix appeared to be a deeply branching member of the cyanobacterial line of decent, and not closely related to green chloroplasts (TURNER et al. 1989). Interestingly, a close relationship was observed between the green chloroplasts and the cyanelle of Cladophora paradoxa. A contrasting phylogenetic relationship between green chloroplasts and Prochlorothrix was derived from the sequences of the psbA genes, which encode the photosystem 2 protein D1 (MORDEN & GOLDEN 1989a,b). Like in chloroplasts, the D1 polypeptide that was predicted from the psbA genes in Prochlorothrix showed a seven amino acid gap at the C-terminal when compared to those in cyanobacteria. According to the authors, this indicates a more recent common ancestor between green chloroplasts and Prochlorothrix than between green chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. Summarizing, Prochlorothrix hollandica resembles the cyanobacteria to a greater extent. The only discrepancies are observed in properties directly related to the structure and function of the photosynthetic appartus.																			0003-9136					DEC	1991				92			555	558																WOS:A1991HW77700041

Pakistan's low adaptive capacity due to high poverty rate, limited financial resources and shortage of physical resources, and continual extreme climatic events including varying temperature, continual flooding, melting glaciers, saturation of lakes, earthquakes, hurricanes, storms, avalanches, droughts, scarcity of water, pest diseases, human healthcare issues, and seasonal and lifestyle changes have persistently threatened the ecosystem, biodiversity, human communities, animal habitations, forests, lands, and oceans with a potential to cause further damages in the future. The likely effect of climate change on common residents of Pakistan with comparison to the world and their per capita impact of climate change are terribly high with local animal species such as lions, vultures, dolphins, and tortoise facing extinction regardless of generating and contributing diminutively to global GHG emissions. The findings of the review suggested that GHG emissions cause climate change which has impacted agriculture livestock and forestry, weather trends and patterns, food water and energy security, and society of Pakistan. This review is a sectorial evaluation of climate change mitigation and adaption approaches in Pakistan in the aforementioned sectors and its economic costs which were identified to be between 7 to 14 billion USD per annum. The research suggested that governmental interference is essential for sustainable development of the country through strict accountability of resources and regulation implemented in the past for generating state-of-the-art climate policy.

Distribution of microplastic and small macroplastic particles across four fish species and sediment in an African lake	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Pollution with microplastics has become an environmental concern worldwide. Yet, little information is available on the distribution of microplastics in lakes. Lake Ziway is one of the largest lakes in Ethiopia and is known for its fishing and drinking water supply. This study aims to examine the distribution of plastic particles, of all sizes (microand small macro-plastics) in four of the major fish species of the lake and in its shoreline sediment. The gastrointestinal tracts analysis showed that 35% of the sampled fishes ingested plastic particles. The median number of particles per fish was 4 (range 1-26). Benthic (Clarias gariepinus) and benthopelagic (Cyprinus carpio and Carassius carassius) fish species were found to contain a significantly higher number of plastic particles in comparison to the planktivorous fish species (Oreochromis niloticus). More fishes ingested plastic particles in the wet compared to the dry season. The maximum plastic size (40 mm fibre) was found in C. carpio. Estimated median mass of plastic particles in fish was 0.07 (0.0002-385.2) mg/kg_ww. Fish and sediment samples close to known potential sources of plastic particles had a higher plastic ingestion frequency (52% of the fish) and higher plastic concentration compared to the other parts of the lake. The median count and mass of plastic particles measured in sediment of the lake were 30,000 (400-124,000) particles/m3 and 764 (0.05-36,233) mg/kg_dw, respectively, the upper limits of which exceed known effect thresholds. Attenuated total reflection (ATR) Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy showed that polypropylene, polyethylene and alkyd-varnish were the dominant polymers in fishes and in sediment. The plastic particles size distributions were Log-linear and were identical for plastic particles found in fish and in sediment, suggesting strong benthic-pelagic coupling of plastic particles transfer.

The mean level of radium-226 (Ra) in bones of grouse sampled from Elliot Lake (28.5 mBq g-1) was higher than that in bones of birds from a distant control site near Sudbury, Ontario (8.0 mBq g-1) but similar to the value in a local control population (28.1 mBq g-1). Birds from Mid- and Low-Serpent River basin populations (with 17.1 and 17.7 mBq g-1, respectively) did not differ from local or distant control populations; muscle, liver and kidney had lower Ra-226 concentrations, which did not differ significantly among populations. Levels of Ra-226 in the crop contents and intestine did not differ significantly by site and were similar to those of food items consumed by the birds. Stomach content values were higher in birds sampled in Elliot Lake and at the local control site than in those taken at the distant control site; birds sampled downstream from Elliot Lake did not differ from distant controls in this regard. Levels of thorium-232 (Th) and Th-230 were below detection limits (0.1-mu-g g-1 and 5.0 mBq g-1, respectively) in bone, muscle and liver tissue in two grouse with elevated levels of Ra-226. Other radionuclides were measurable in some tissues: U-238 in bone at 0.4-mu-g g-1, in muscle to 0.2-mu-g g-1, in liver to 1.0-mu-g-1 Th was found only in muscle (8.0 mBq g-1); polonium-210 (Po) was found in bone, muscle and liver (maxima: 24.0, 7.0, 16.0 mBq g-1) with the exception of one muscle sample; lead-210 (Pb) was detected in only one liver sample (50.0 mBq g-1). Environmental levels fell within ranges previously reported at the sites, or at similar locations elsewhere. Leaves of trembling and largetooth aspen growing in the basin had mean Ra-226 levels of 41.8 and 52.7 mBq g-1 (dry weight) respectively, and fungal material carried up to 215.4 mBq g-1 (air-dried), with some variation by site. River and lake waters sampled near the U tailings had 118.1 mBq litre-1 of dissolved Ra-226; at the distant control site the value was 12.1 mBq litre-1. The concentration ratios (CR) between bone of grouse collected at the Elliot Lake sites and trembling and largetooth aspen leaves were 1.38 and 1.09 (fresh weight basis); from other diet items and to other tissues the values were less than unity. Bone tissue : water ratios, based on dissolved Ra-226 levels, ranged to 30.89. People eating grouse from the study area are unlikely to consume radionuclides in excess of limits currently established by Canadian regulatory authorities.																			0269-7491	1873-6424					1992	77	1					39	50		10.1016/0269-7491(92)90156-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0269-7491(92)90156-5								15091976					WOS:A1992HW54700006

These areas bring the normal challenges of deep water, turbidity, uncertain bottom types and, in areas such as Cook Inlet, some of the world's largest tidal height changes and tidal currents. This paired with the presence of sea ice, which can be up to tens of meters thick and can be present for most of the year, just ratchets up the difficulties. Add in weather, ice and the lack of vessels, which often limits field time to a short window in the summer, requires equipment to work without servicing for one or more years, just spicing it up some more. This has been the crucible within which numerous mooring designs have been developed, tweaked and eventually deployed in less challenging southern latitudes. ASL has been designing and deploying mooring arrays for the waters around Alaska and around the Arctic since 1977. These have included a recent three-year mooring program of up to 11 bottom and taut-line moorings for currents, ice and water quality measurements in the fast flowing and turbid, northern reaches of Cook Inlet. One acoustic release was temporarily lost during the first deployment, but was found with the much-appreciated assistance of a local beachcomber. With modifications of the mooring designs and some analysis of NOAA bathymetry data to allow for the careful selection of mooring locations, all subsequent deployments had 100% instrument recovery rates and all without further beachcomber assistance. The Chukchi and Beaufort Seas proved less challenging for currents, but with ice keels of over 30 m draft and the odd ice island, special care had to be taken to ensure a 100% mooring recovery rate for the up to 23 moorings deployed starting in 2005 and ending in 2016. While most of the Chukchi and Beaufort deployments were at relatively safe depths of around 40 m, we tried our luck for a year with a couple of moorings at a depth of 25 m, within sight of land. In 2008, ASL designed its deepest deployed moorings at the time. With deployments in water depths up to 1000 m, the multi-instrument taut-line moorings were required to provide a relatively stable platform for an Ice Profiling Sonar only 60 m beneath the surface. After years of successful deployments in the Canadian Beaufort Sea, the mooring design was modified to accept multiple Acoustic Zooplankton and Fish Profilers for the Alaskan Beaufort Sea. These tried and tested, long-term mooring designs have made their way to more southern climates. With ultra-deep deployments of 6 to 12 months at 31 N, the experience of designing and improving deep water Arctic moorings proved invaluable, particularly in keeping wave profilers within 70 m of the surface on taut-line moorings of over 1500 m. A short tautline mooring design that survived multiple deployments in Cook Inlet has now made it to 49 N where it is monitoring for turbidity flows near Vancouver - at least, we are hoping it still is.																			0197-7385						2017																								WOS:000455012000171

The ground deformation, a key indicator of permafrost degradation, can be quantified via geodetic observations, especially using multi-temporal InSAR techniques. The previous InSAR studies, however, either rely on data-driven models or Stefan-equation-based models, which are both lacking of consideration of the spatial-temporal variations of freeze-thaw processes. Furthermore, the magnitudes and patterns of the permafrost-related ground deformation over large scales (e.g., 1 x 10(5) km(2) or larger) is still insufficiently quantified or poorly understood. In this study, to account for the spatial heterogeneity of freeze-thaw processes, we develop a permafrost-tailored InSAR approach by incorporating a MODIS-land-surface-temperature-integrated ground deformation model to reconstruct the seasonal and long-term deformation. Utilizing the approach to Sentinel-1 SAR images on the vast regions of about 140,000 km(2) of the central QTP during 2014-2019, we observe widespread seasonal deformation up to about 80 mm with a mean value of about 10 mm and linear subsidence up to 20 mm/year. We apply the geographical detector to determine the controlling factors on the permafrost-related deformation. We find that the slope angle is the primary controller on the seasonal deformation: strong magnitudes and variations of seasonal deformation are most pronounced in flat or gentle-slope regions. The aspect angle, vegetation and soil bulk density exhibit a certain correlation with seasonal deformation as well. Meanwhile, we find that a linear subsidence is higher in the regions with high ground ice content and warm permafrost. It indicates that warm and ice-rich permafrost regions are more vulnerable to extensive long-term subsidence. We also observe that the cold permafrost regions experience lower linear subsidence even with high ground ice content, which indicate ice loss is limited. Thus, we infer that under continuously warming, the transition from cold permafrost to warm permafrost may lead to more extensive ground ice melting. Moreover, the strong subsidence/uplift signals surrounding some lakes suggesting that the change of local hydrological conditions may induce localized permafrost degradation/aggradation. Our study demonstrates the capability of the permafrost-tailored InSAR approach to quantify the permafrost freeze-thaw dynamics as well as their spatial-temporal patterns over large scales in vast permafrost areas.					; Hu, Guojie/M-5738-2019; Liu, Lin/Q-4237-2018; Wu, Tonghua/AAE-4563-2019; Chen, Jie/HNI-0261-2023	zhang, jing/0000-0003-3574-6438; CHEN, jie/0000-0001-9089-8587; Hao, Junming/0000-0002-9172-9344; Liu, Lin/0000-0002-9581-1337; 													0034-4257	1879-0704				JAN	2022	268								112778	10.1016/j.rse.2021.112778	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2021.112778		NOV 2021											WOS:000722737400003
J	BENNETT, KD; BOREHAM, S; SHARP, MJ; SWITSUR, VR				BENNETT, KD; BOREHAM, S; SHARP, MJ; SWITSUR, VR			HOLOCENE HISTORY OF ENVIRONMENT, VEGETATION AND HUMAN SETTLEMENT ON CATTA NESS, LUNNASTING, SHETLAND	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. Pollen, charcoal, chemical, physical, magnetic and tephra analyses of C-14-dated Holocene lake sediments from Dallican Water, Catta Ness, north-east Shetland, are presented and interpreted in the light of models of Holocene climatic change, the Shetland archaeological record, and local documentary evidence. The sequence was subdivided and analysed using principal components analysis, a numerical zonation of the pollen data using optimal and binary divisive techniques, and measures of palynological richness and rates of change between samples. 2. Sedimentation began at 9900 years BP, and until 9620 BP consisted of minerogenic sediments eroded from raw soils. Vegetation was herbaceous until 9500 BP, when Betula woodlands began to develop. 3. During the period 9620-7500 BP woodland diversified (Betula, Corylus avellana, Juniperus communis, Quercus, Alnus glutinosa and possibly Ulmus and Fraxinus excelsior) with tall-herb communities that included a high proportion of ferns. Lake sediments became predominantly organic as soils became more stable, with some leaching of cations, and erosion was reduced. 4. From 7500 to 5400 BP tree cover changed little, but the herb and fern communities were replaced by plants of heathland and mires. Erosion increased slightly and charcoal accumulation was high. These changes suggest the presence of Mesolithic people, and, associated with them, a mammalian herbivore (possibly red deer), which reduced the herb and fern communities by grazing. 5. After 5400 BP, vegetation passed through a series of successional stages, returning within a few hundred years to a type similar to that prevailing earlier than 7500 BP. Contemporaneously, erosion decreased as soils restabilized. Charcoal accumulation was low. We suggest that the herbivore had become extinct, and the islands became uninhabited. 6. From c. 4800 BP, Calluna vulgaris and other mire plants increased, probably due to natural soil leaching and acidification. The extent of peatland greatly increased, sealing sources of supply of erodible material. Pollen and charcoal data suggest that people were present on the island from c. 4500 BP, supporting archaeological dating for occupation of Shetland by agricultural communities. The first phase of clearance on Catta Ness was c. 4000 BP, and lasted for c. 400 years. Woodland then increased to its former levels. 7. Woodland was almost completely cleared from the area within 150 years c. 3120 BP, probably as a deliberate act to extend rough grazing. This dramatic event cannot be correlated with any known cultural changes in the Shetland archaeological record, and probably results from local human activity. Heath plants increased substantially, and sediments became more organic as erosion sources continued to diminish. 8. Vegetation and land use have remained more or less constant for the past 3000 years, despite major cultural changes, such as the building of brochs c. 2000 BP and the arrival of Norse people c. 1150 BP. Documentary evidence suggests that the area of land under cultivation on Catta Ness has not changed within the last 350 years. 9. This study has confirmed the former presence of Alnus glutinosa on Shetland, and indicated that Quercus was also present. Thus, the early Holocene woodlands of Shetland were, at least locally, more diverse than had hitherto been realized. 10. At least two layers of volcanic ash occur in the sediments, probably originating from Icelandic sources. A layer of basic ash c. 9300 BP is identified as the Saksunarvatn ash previously described from the Faroe Islands. A complex layer of acidic ash c. 4000 BP is probably part of the Hekla 4 ash fall. These horizons hold considerable potential as dating horizons within the Holocene of the north-east Atlantic, and contribute to understanding of the distribution of Holocene tephras in the area. This is the first complete Holocene tephra record to be obtained from the British Isles.

Shafiqul Islam			Assessment of heavy metal pollution, distribution and source apportionment in the sediment from Feni River estuary, Bangladesh	CHEMOSPHERE												Heavy metal pollution in sediment resources may pose serious threat to ecosystem and human health through food web. In this study, surface sediment samples of 10 stations along the Feni River estuary were analyzed to profile the accumulation, sources and pollution levels of heavy metals. The results revealed that the average contents (mu g g(-1)) of eight selected heavy metals followed the order of Mn (37.85) > Cr (35.28) > Ni (33.27) > Co (31.02) > Pb (6.47) > Ag (1.09) > As (0.85) > Hg (0.71), and the concentrations varied spatially and seasonally with relatively higher levels at upward stations and during the rainy season. According to sediment quality guidelines (SQGs), the sediment samples were heavily contaminated with Ag and Hg, and moderately with Co. Threshold effect concentration (TEC) and probable effect concentration (PEC) values indicated that the concentration of only Ni and Cr were likely to occasionally exhibit adverse effects on the ecosystem. Enrichment factor (EF), geo-accumulation index (I-geo) and contamination factor (CF) analyses revealed that Ag, Co and Hg were at moderate to high pollution levels and the rests (As, Cr, Ni, Pb and Mn) were at no to low pollution levels. Potential ecological risk index (PERI) also showed that Ag, Co and Hg were the most potential ecological risk factor being determined in this studied area. Correlation matrix combined with multivariate principal component analysis and cluster analysis suggest that Ag, Co, Ni and Hg originated from anthropogenic sources (agrochemicals, silver nanoparticles anti-microbial agent, silver plating), whereas As, Cr, Pb and Mn primarily originated from natural geological background.

J	Ran, YH; Li, X; Cheng, GD				Ran, Youhua; Li, Xin; Cheng, Guodong			Climate warming over the past half century has led to thermal degradation of permafrost on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau	CRYOSPHERE												Air temperature increases thermally degrade permafrost, which has widespread impacts on engineering design, resource development, and environmental protection in cold regions. This study evaluates the potential thermal degradation of permafrost over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) from the 1960s to the 2000s using estimated decadal mean annual air temperatures (MAATs) by integrating remote-sensing-based estimates of mean annual land surface temperatures (MASTs), leaf area index (LAI) and fractional snow cover values, and decadal mean MAAT date from 152 weather stations with a geographically weighted regression (GWR). The results reflect a continuous rise of approximately 0.04 degrees C a(-1) in the decadal mean MAAT values over the past half century. A thermal-condition classification matrix is used to convert modelled MAATs to permafrost thermal type. Results show that the climate warming has led to a thermal degradation of permafrost in the past half century. The total area of thermally degraded permafrost is approximately 153.76 x 10(4) km(2), which corresponds to 88% of the permafrost area in the 1960s. The thermal condition of 75.2% of the very cold permafrost, 89.6% of the cold permafrost, 90.3% of the cool permafrost, 92.3% of the warm permafrost, and 32.8% of the very warm permafrost has been degraded to lower levels of thermal condition. Approximately 49.4% of the very warm permafrost and 96% of the likely thawing permafrost has degraded to seasonally frozen ground. The mean elevations of the very cold, cold, cool, warm, very warm, and likely thawing permafrost areas increased by 88, 97, 155, 185, 161, and 250 m, respectively. The degradation mainly occurred from the 1960s to the 1970s and from the 1990s to the 2000s. This degradation may lead to increased risks to infrastructure, reductions in ecosystem resilience, increased flood risks, and positive climate feedback effects. It therefore affects the well-being of millions of people and sustainable development at the Third Pole.

To investigate the effects of eutrophication on GHG dynamics, we conducted field measurements every three months from January 2019 to October 2019 in Lake Ulansuhai, a shallow eutrophic lake (mean depth of 0.7 m) located in a semi-arid region in Northern China. We found that Lake Ulansuhai was a predominantly source of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2); however, it converted to a CO2 sink in July due to eutrophication. It was also a strong source of methane (CH4) with a mean CO2 emission of 35.7 +/- 12.1 mmol m- 2 d-1 and CH4 emission of 5.9 +/- 2.9 mmol m- 2 d-1. The CO2 concentrations in most sites and CH4 concentrations in all sites were supersaturated, with the average partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) being 654 +/- 34 mu atm and the partial pressure of CH4 (pCH4) being 157 +/- 37 mu atm. The partial pressures and emissions of the greenhouse gases exhibited substantial seasonal and spatial variations. The correlation analysis between the trophic level index and the partial pressure of the greenhouse gases indicated that eutrophication could significantly decrease the CO2 emissions but increase the CH4 emissions from the lake, resulting in a CH4 and CO2 emission ratio of approximately 2 in terms of global warming potential. Eutrophication decreased the pCO2 in the lake and subsequently increased the pCH4 due to nutrient input, thereby enhancing primary production. The results indicated that shallow eutrophic lakes in arid regions are strong sources of CH4 and that eutrophication could alter the greenhouse gas emission patterns.

J	LOOIJENGA, PJ; DIELEMAN, JC				LOOIJENGA, PJ; DIELEMAN, JC			EFFECT OF TIDAL SIMULATIONS AND ENTRAINMENT OF AN ENDOGENOUS TIDAL RHYTHM IN A NON-TIDAL POPULATION OF GAMMARUS-ZADDACHI	BIJDRAGEN TOT DE DIERKUNDE												The activity of G. zaddachi from a non-tidal environment (the brackish lake De Putten, North Holland, The Netherlands), was studied in a current chamber in which tidal cycles can be simulated, in order to make a comparison with estuarine populations. The animals show a clear nocturnal activity pattern in stagnant water, which is preserved after transfer to running water, but with a reduced amplitude. As in estuarine populations of G. zaddachi, a very strong increase in swimming activity is provoked by a so-called complete high tide simulation, i.e., a decrease in current velocity, followed by a short period of standstill and a slow current in the opposite direction, and a rise in salinity (which resulted also in a rise in pressure of maximally 0.1 atm due to pumping) and in temperature. Contrary to what was concluded for estuarine populations, these non-tidal G. zaddachi show a much stronger response to changes in salinity than to changes in current. High tide simulations consisting of changes in salinity only result in an increase in activity, comparable with that at complete high tide simulations. A strong response also is noticed to a short increase in pressure of 0.3 and 0.5 atm, but the construction of the current chamber only allows tests of longer duration with an increase in pressure of 0.15 atm. This merely causes a small increase in swimming activity. Simulations in the light have the same effect on activity as simulations in the dark. An (endogenous) circatidal activity rhythm with peak swimming at the expected time of simulated high tide is entrained in non-tidal G. zaddachi by subjecting them to a series of complete high tide simulations at tidal intervals. A series of high tide simulations, consisting of changes in current and salinity (but without changes in temperature) also entrains the rhythm, but neither changes in current nor changes in salinity are able to entrain the circatidal rhythm when applied alone (the same holds true for the small increases in pressure, due to pumping). The result of a combination of factors is more than simply the sum of their individual effects. The endogenous tidal rhythm does not show any sign of inhibition at expected high water in the light. Earlier fieldwork on the migration of estuarine G. zaddachi suggests that the tidal migrations of this species are confined to the dark. The activity of freshly caught estuarine G. zaddachi from the river Slack (France) shows a circatidal rhythm in the laboratory with equal peaks in the light and in the dark. The absence of tidal migrations during spring tides in daytime is difficult to explain on the basis of the behavior observed under laboratory conditions. Possibly the influence of light in the laboratory is different from that in the field, and further fieldwork will be necessary to determine the effect of light on emergence, height of swimming, etc., of estuarine G. zaddachi.																			0067-8546						1980	50	1					35	51																WOS:A1980KV22200002
S	Giordano, G		Funiciello, R; Giordano, G		Giordano, G.		CARG Team	Stratigraphy, volcano tectonics and evolution of the Colli Albani volcanic field	COLLI ALBANI VOLCANO	Special Publications of IAVCEI											The Colli Albani volcano has been active since c. 600 ka and is presently quiescent. Rock stratigraphy indicates that the activity of the volcano has undergone major changes in terms of eruption style, average eruption rate and location of active vents. The chemistry of the Colli Albani products is remarkably mafic, K-rich and silica undersaturated. Nevertheless, the volcano has experienced all types of eruption styles, from plinian explosive paroxysms, to milder strombolian and hawaiian eruptions, to effusive, including large- and small-scale phreatomagmatism. The first period of activity of the volcano is termed the 'Vulcan Laziale' period, and lasted from c. 600 ka to c. 355 ka. During this period, the volcanism was predominantly explosive, with an average eruption rate of 1 km(3) ka(-1). At least seven intermediate- to large-volume ignimbrites (VEI 5-7) were erupted and emplaced over an area larger than 1600 km(2), forming an extensive ignimbrite shield around the central, continuously forming c. 8 x 8 km(2) caldera. The caldera complex and the ignimbrite shield are named the 'Vulcan Laziale edifice'. The Vulcano Laziale edifice can in turn be subdivided into a lower Tisolitic Tuffs succession' (c. 600 500 ka), in which ignimbrites are dominated by large-scale phreatomagmatism associated with the likely presence of an early caldera lake, and an overlying `Pozzolane Tuffs succession', in which ignimbrites show a dominantly magmatic fragmentation style, probably in response to progressive exhaustion of the caldera lake. The typical succession of these mafic ignimbrites is composed of a sub-plinain to plinian basal scoria fall deposit covered by the main dark scoria and ash tabular ignimbrite sheet found as far as >30 km from the caldera rim and across ridges several hundreds metres in elevation, and is characterized by co-ignimbrite breccias at proximal locations. Major ignimbrites erupted with an average interval of c. 40 ka. After each paroxysmal ignimbrite eruption, volcanic activity was predominantly effusive to mild explosive, and was concentrated along peri-caldera fissure systems, forming continuous scoria cone and lava ridges, together with more explosive eruptions from intracaldera vents. The last major caldera-forming eruption of the Vulcano Laziale period occurred at c. 355 ka, emplacing the ignimbrites of the Villa Senni formation. Following this eruption, the complex Tuscolano-Artemisio pen- and extracaldera fissure system, predominantly composed of scoria cones and lavas, formed in response to the deflation of the caldera and peri-caldera area, together with formation of the intracaldera Facie stratovolcano. These edifices were emplaced between c. 355 and c. 180 ka, an interval termed the 'Tuscolano Artemisio Faete period'. Although similar peri-caldera and intracaldera activity occurred earlier, that is, after each major caldera-forming eruption during the Vulcano Laziale period, the Tuscolano Artemisio Faete period was subject to a significant reduction in average eruption rate, by one order of magnitude, of 0.1 km(3) ka I, which can be related to a consistent reduction in the deep recharging of the plumbing system, and suggesting why no further ignimbrite eruptions occurred after 355 ka. Peri-caldera activity began along the northern and eastern peri-caldera ring fractures (Tuscolano and Artemisio sections, respectively) and after c. 300 ka progressively migrated outwards to extracaldera positions (Pantano Borghese section) and to the western peri-caldera fractures (S. Maria delle Mole section). The activity of these latter fracture systems ended almost simultaneosly, together with that of the Faete intracaldera stratovolcano, between c. 280 and c. 250 ka. After 250 ka, activity migrated to the south (Monte Due Torri section). The most recent activity along this latter peri-caldera area inter-fingers (between c. 200 ka and c. 180 ka) with phreatomagmatic products, which instead became dominant in the most recent activity of the Colli Albani volcano. Beginning from c. 200 ka (Via dei Laghi period), the western section of the pericaldera area has been the site of repeated very small- to small-volume, maar-forming phreatomagmatic eruptions, which formed both monogenetic and polygenetic maars, collectively named the Via dei Laghi maar field. The most recent of these maars is the polygenetic Albano mar. which was formed after c. 70 ka by at least seven eruptions migrating along a NW SE-trending, 3.5-km-long fracture. The last eruption of the maar occurred at <23 ka. Subsequent phreatic activity occurred throughout the Holocene, with lahars originating from dramatic withdrawals of the deep maar lake, at least up to the Eneolithic time (6000-5000 years ago) and probably up to Roman times (fourth century BCE), when the Romans dug a tunnel drain to keep the lake at a constant low level. The Albano area is currently the site of volcanic.vas emissions, ground uplift and periodic seismic swarms, which may indicate persistent activity of a magmatic body at depth.

J	Bhateria, R; Jain, D				Bhateria, Rachna; Jain, Disha			Water quality assessment of lake water: a review	SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Ever increasing population, urbanization and modernization are posing problems of sewage disposal and contamination of surface waters like lakes. Natural water gets contaminated due to weathering of rocks, leaching of soils and mining processing, etc. Various types of problems in lake which cause nutrient enrichment in lake have been reviewed. Land use change and longer growing seasons could increase the use of fertilizers with subsequent leaching to watercourses, rivers and lakes, increasing the risk of eutrophication and loss of biodiversity. Water quality can be assessed by various parameters such as BOD, temperature, electrical conductivity, nitrate, phosphorus, potassium, dissolved oxygen, etc. Heavy metals such as Pb, Cr, Fe, Hg, etc. are of special concern because they produce water or chronic poisoning in aquatic animals. Harmful algal blooms are becoming increasingly common in freshwater ecosystems globally. Pollution by plastic debris is an increasing environmental concern in water bodies, where it affects open-water, shoreline and benthic environments. Surface water densities of plastics are as high as those reported for areas of litter accumulation within oceanic gyres. Different methods have been used to analyse the water quality of lake such as Hyperion, water quality index and hazard quotient. It is recommended that pollution prevention and water re-use should be adopted in combination with the recycling of nutrients in controlled urban agriculture.

However, understanding how inland lakes contribute to global carbon cycle is seriously hampered due to a shortage of long-term records. This study investigated the carbon dioxide (CO2) flux from the lake Taihu, a large (2400 km(2)) and shallow (mean depth 1.9 m) eutrophic lake in subtropical region, based on a long term (2000-2015) measurement of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) at high spatiotemporal resolution, We found that the Lake Taihu was a significant source of atmospheric CO2 with an average CO2 emission flux at 18.2 +/- 8.4 mmol m(-2) d(-1) (mean +/- 1standard deviation) and a mean annual pCO(2) value of 778 +/- 169 mu atm. The highest pCO(2) and CO2 flux were observed in eutrophic zone with a high external input of carbon and nutrient, and the lowest in non-eutrophic zones with no direct external input of nutrient and carbon. A substantial seasonal pattern in pCO(2) was observed, particularly in eutrophic pelagic area, and was significantly negatively correlated with chlorophyll a. Long-term measurement showed the interannual variation in annual lake CO2 dynamics, which was highly sensitive to human-induced nutrient input. Watershed input of carbon and nutrient leads to the high CO2 level, counterbalancing the in-lake primary production. All lines of evidence suggest that human activities may have predominate contribution to CO2 source in the lake Taihu, and this mechanism might be widespread in global freshwater lakes.

W.; Zhang, Chaosheng			Internal phosphorus loading from sediments causes seasonal nitrogen limitation for harmful algal blooms	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												It is proposed that the internal loading of phosphorus (P) from sediments plays an important role in seasonal nitrogen (N) limitation for harmful algal blooms (HABs), although there is a lack of experimental evidence. In this study, an ecarophic bay from the large and shallow Lake Taihu was studied for investigating the contribution of internal P to N limitation over one-year field sampling (February 2016 to JanuaTy 2017). A prebloom-bloom period was identified from February to August according to the increase in Chla concentration in the water column, during which the ratio of total N to total P (TN TP) exponentially decreased with month from 43.4 to 7.4. High-resolution dialysis (HR-Peeper) and diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) analysis showed large variations in the vertical distribution of mobile P (SRP and DGT-labile P) in sediments, resulting in the SRP diffusion flux at the sediment-water interface ranging from 0.01 to 6.76 mg/m2/d (minus sign denotes downward flux). Significant and linear correlations existed between SRP and soluble Fe(11) concentrations in pore water, reflecting that the spatial-temporal variation in mobile P was controlled by microbe-mediated Fe redox cycling. Mass estimation showed that the cumulative flux of SRP from sediments accounted for 54% of the increase in TP observed in the water column during the prebloombloom period. These findings are supported by the significantly negative correlation (p 001) observed between sediment SRP flux and water column TN/TP during the same period. Overall, these results provide solid evidence for the major role of internal P loading in causing N limitation during the prebloom-bloom period. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Currently, more than half of water bodies are in a degraded condition and nutrient enrichment is one of the main culprits. Therefore, there is a pressing need to establish reliable and comparable nutrient criteria that are consistent with good ecological status. This paper highlights the wide range of nutrient criteria currently in use by Member States of the European Union to support good ecological status and goes on to suggest that inappropriate criteria may be hindering the achievement of good status. Along with a comprehensive overview of nutrient criteria, we provide a critical analysis of the threshold concentrations and approaches by which these are set. We identify four essential issues: (1) Different nutrients (nitrogen and/or phosphorus) are used for different water categories in different countries. (2) The use of different nutrient fractions (total, dissolved inorganic) and statistical summary metrics (e.g., mean, percentiles, seasonal, annual) currently hampers comparability between countries, particularly for rivers, transitional and coastal waters. (3) Wide ranges in nutrient threshold values within shared water body types, in some cases showing more than a 10-told difference in concentrations. (4) Different approaches used to set threshold nutrient concentrations to define the boundary between "good" and "moderate" ecological status. Expert judgement-based methods resulted in significantly higher (less stringent) good-moderate threshold values compared with data-driven approaches, highlighting the importance of consistent and rigorous approaches to criteria setting. We suggest that further development of nutrient criteria should be based on relationships between ecological status and nutrient concentrations, taking into account the need for comparability between different water categories, water body types within these categories, and countries.

The mean concentrations of Sigma(16) PFAS in the different media were in the ranges of 20.7-98.2 pg/m(3) in air, 17.7-467 ng/L in water, 0.04-15.0 ng/g dry weight (dw) in sediments, and not detected (n.d.)-12.9 ng/g dw in soils, and the mean concentrations of Sigma(19) PFAS in fish ranged from n.d. to 197 ng/g wet weight. The most frequently detected PFAS were perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in air and soils, perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) in water, and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in sediment and fish. Long-chain PFAS species dominated over short-chain PFAS in most media samples except for the water phase. Sediment-water partition coefficients (log K-d) and bioaccumulation factors (log BAF) of PFAS were calculated using measured concentrations in water, sediments, and fish. Log K-d of PFAS tended to increase with increasing CF2 units of PFAS, and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) and PFOS showed the highest log BAF value (> 3.0) in all fish species. These results indicate that longer-chain PFAS, especially PFOS, can be effectively accumulated in biota such as fish.

As a result of the revision of herbarium materials and field studies, new locations of this species were identified, and distribution data were updated. The features of ecological limitation and some morphological and eco-biomorphological characteristics of plants from different parts of the area are compared. Taking into account the vision of modern taxonomy, the taxonomic position is presented for the first time, as well as a list of collected samples from all known locations of this species. Ranunculus botschantzevii is an endemic plant known from several locations in the western part of the Pamir-Alai on the spurs of the Gissar (Uzbekistan) and Zerayshan (Tajikistan) ranges. This is an autochthonous representative of the mountain Central Asian flora, which emerged in the process of regional adaptive diversification of ancient Mediterranean predecessors. Until the 1970s of the last century, Bochantsev's buttercup was known only from the Beshnau mountains (Gissar range), from where it had been described. Later, in the process of collecting materials for Flora of Tajikistan (1953), the second location of this species was found in the Valangi-Daroz tract (Mogian River). The research materials were the results of an audit of the herbarium collections of the genus Ranunculus L. in Middle Asia (TASH, TAD, LE, KG, AA, MW, LE, TK), as well as the results obtained during the expeditionary and stationary work of the authors in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan in 2017-2019. Field studies were carried out by the route method, conducted on the Baysuntau ridge (Uzbekistan) in the second half of May 2012 and 2019 in the area of Hodzha-Gurgur-ata mountain, as well as in the Machai-Darya river basin, at an altitude of 2300-2700 m above sea level. Studies on the Zerayshan ridge (Tajikistan) were carried out in June 2019 in the vicinities of Iskanderkul Lake and to the south along the Kanchoch River, at an altitude of 2500-3050 m above sea level. Subsequently, the geographical coordinates of the previously known locations were refined, and all information was entered into the database for subsequent point mapping. Field surveys made it possible to clarify the ecological-phytocoenotic limitation and some morphological parameters (especially the characteristics of basal leaves, the degree of branching of stems, plant height, etc.) in different parts of the area of Bochantsev's buttercup. A more diverse than the previously known spectrum of morphological variability of basal leaves was found. It was noted that in the western and eastern parts of the area, the general habitual changes of this species manifest themselves in different ways, as well as environmental features. Signs of ephemeroidity in this species are combined with the characteristics of a typical alpine plant. Obviously, varying the boundaries of altitudinal distribution and some ecological and morphological plasticity of the buttercup are directly related to the possibilities of expansion and displacement of phenological phases in the summer months, in contrast to real ephemeroid plants. At present, four main locations of Ranunculus botschantzevii Bochantsev's buttercup are known within the borders of Uzbekistan, and two are within Tajikistan. As a result of our field surveys, the species was found at two points at the Baysuntau ridge, as well as in a new place at the Zerayshan ridge. Presumably, the distribution of this endemic is limited to the mountains of the western part of the Pamir-Alai. Despite the fact that this buttercup is rare, its new findings are likely. Since the habitats of Bochantsev's buttercup are inaccessible and are not subject to direct anthropogenic impact, it does not yet need special protection measures. However, its features such as narrow-local distribution, rare occurrence and small populations require, at least, monitoring attention.

J	Kaplin, PA; Selivanov, AO				Kaplin, PA; Selivanov, AO			Lateglacial and Holocene sea level changes in semi-enclosed seas of North Eurasia: examples from the contrasting Black and White Seas	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY					Symposium on High Latitude Eurasian Paleoenvironments	MAY, 2002	Moscow, RUSSIA	IGBP PAGES				A comparison of the Black and White Seas, which differ in their tectonic, glacial and climatic history but which share a strong dependence upon limited water exchange with the world ocean, represents an opportunity for the identification of major factors controlling sea level changes during the Lateglacial and Holocene and for the correlation of these changes. Existing data were critically analyzed and compared with the results of geological, geomorphological and palacohydrological studies obtained by the present authors during the past two decades. We conclude that glacioeustatic processes played a major role in relative sea level changes on most coasts of both areas. However, along several coastlines, other factors overwhelm glacioeustasy during some time intervals. In the Black Sea, water level rose from its minimum position, - 100-120 m, at 18-17 ka BP, to - 20-30 m at nearly 9 ka BP. In the White Sea, the decreasing trend in relative sea level is well illustrated on the Kola Peninsula and in Karelia, subject to glacioisostatic emergence. A drastic sea level fall from + 15 to - 25 m occurred with the drainage of glacial lakes in the eastern White Sea (12.5-9.5 ka BP). The Black and White Sea histories changed drastically in the early Holocene or in the beginning of the middle Holocene (9.5-7.5 ka BP) due to the intrusion of water from the Mediterranean and the Barents seas, respectively. During this period, the White Sea developed under the strong influence of the formation of "ice shelves" and "dead ice" blocks, retreating glaciers, as well as of glacioisostatic and related processes. The Black Sea history, however, was determined by water exchange with the Mediterranean via the shallow Dardanelles and Bosporus straits (outflow from the Black Sea 10-9.5 ka BP and inflow from 97.5 ka BP according to various data), and, partially, by river discharge variations caused by climatic changes on the Russian Plain. The hypothesis of a catastrophic sea level rise from - 120-150 to - 15-20 m nearly 7550 calendar years BP is not supported by our data. Water intrusion from the Mediterranean was fast but not catastrophic. In the Black Sea, periods of high sea levels after the intrusion of Mediterranean waters are dated from four sedimentary complexes, Vityazevian, Kalamitian, Dzhemetian and Nymphaean, from nearly 7.5, 7-6, 5.5-4.5 and 2.2-1.7 ka BP, respectively. A fluctuating pattern of sea level change was established in the White Sea after the drainage of proglacial lakes and intrusion of ocean waters at the end of the early Holocene (nearly 8.5-8.2 ka BP). Major periods of sea level rise in the White Sea are dated from the late Boreal-early Atlantic (8.5-7.5 ka BP), late Atlantic (6.5-5.2 ka BP), middle Subboreal (4.5-4 ka BP) and middle Subatlantic (1.8-1.5 ka BP). Fluctuations of relative sea level during the middle and late Holocene were possibly on the order of several meters (from + 2-3 to - 2-3 m in the Black Sea and from + 3-5 to - 2-3 m in the White Sea). Lower estimates of regressive stages are principally derived from archaeological data on ancient settlements in tectonically submerging deltaic areas and cannot be regarded as reliable. Palaeohydrological analysis does not indicate that intensive (15-25 m or greater) sea level fluctuations were present in the Black Sea or in the White Sea during the middle and late Holocene. Instead, such analysis provides independent evidence to support the argument that significant differences in water level between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean could not be maintained for an extended period of time.

Global lake thermal regions shift under climate change	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Water temperature is critical for the ecology of lakes. However, the ability to predict its spatial and seasonal variation is constrained by the lack of a thermal classification system. Here we define lake thermal regions using objective analysis of seasonal surface temperature dynamics from satellite observations. Nine lake thermal regions are identified that mapped robustly and largely contiguously globally, even for small lakes. The regions differed from other global patterns, and so provide unique information. Using a lake model forced by 21st century climate projections, we found that 12%, 27% and 66% of lakes will change to a lower latitude thermal region by 2080-2099 for low, medium and high greenhouse gas concentration trajectories (Representative Concentration Pathways 2.6, 6.0 and 8.5) respectively. Under the worst-case scenario, a 79% reduction in the number of lakes in the northernmost thermal region is projected. This thermal region framework can facilitate the global scaling of lake-research.

However, their presence in Antarctic freshwaters has not been yet reported. Here, we investigated the occurrence of microplastics in a stream from an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island - ASPA No. 126), which is subject to stringent environmental protection measures as a result of which it is considered a pristine international reference site for inland waters research. Our results showed the presence of three types of microplastics in a freshwater seasonal stream, namely four polyester fibers, one black and three transparent; two acrylic fibers, one transparent and one red; and two transparent polytetrafluoroethylene films. The length and width of these fibers and films were in the 400-3546 mu m (average 1118 mu m), and 10-1026 mu m (average 199 mu m) ranges respectively. The concentration of MP was 0.95 items/1000 m(3) with estimated variability in the 0.47-1.43 items/1000 m(3) range. This is the first report of the presence of microplastics in Antarctic freshwater with the uniqueness that it is an Antarctic Specially Protected Area, meaning that plastic pollution reached even the most remote and pristine environments in the planet.

The past and future of global river ice	NATURE												More than one-third of Earth's landmass is drained by rivers that seasonally freeze over. Ice transforms the hydrologic(1,2), ecologic(3,4), climatic(5) and socio-economic(6-8) functions of river corridors. Although river ice extent has been shown to be declining in many regions of the world(1), the seasonality, historical change and predicted future changes in river ice extent and duration have not yet been quantified globally. Previous studies of river ice, which suggested that declines in extent and duration could be attributed to warming temperatures(9,10), were based on data from sparse locations. Furthermore, existing projections of future ice extent are based solely on the location of the 0-degrees C isotherm11. Here, using satellite observations, we show that the global extent of river ice is declining, and we project a mean decrease in seasonal ice duration of 6.10 +/- 0.08 days per 1-degrees C increase in global mean surface air temperature. We tracked the extent of river ice using over 400,000 clear-sky Landsat images spanning 1984-2018 and observed a mean decline of 2.5 percentage points globally in the past three decades. To project future changes in river ice extent, we developed an observationally calibrated and validated model, based on temperature and season, which reduced the mean bias by 87 per cent compared with the 0-degree-Celsius isotherm approach. We applied this model to future climate projections for 2080-2100: compared with 2009-2029, the average river ice duration declines by 16.7 days under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, whereas under RCP 4.5 it declines on average by 7.3 days. Our results show that, globally, river ice is measurably declining and will continue to decline linearly with projected increases in surface air temperature towards the end of this century.

Review of the status and mass changes of Himalayan-Karakoram glaciers	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												We present a comprehensive review of the status and changes in glacier length (since the 1850s), area and mass (since the 1960s) along the Himalayan-Karakoram (HK) region and their climate-change context. A quantitative reliability classification of the field-based mass-balance series is developed. Glaciological mass balances agree better with remotely sensed balances when we make an objective, systematic exclusion of likely flawed mass-balance series. The Himalayan mean glaciological mass budget was similar to the global average until 2000, and likely less negative after 2000. Mass wastage in the Himalaya resulted in increasing debris cover, the growth of glacial lakes and possibly decreasing ice velocities. Geodetic measurements indicate nearly balanced mass budgets for Karakoram glaciers since the 1970s, consistent with the unchanged extent of supraglacial debris-cover. Himalayan glaciers seem to be sensitive to precipitation partly through the albedo feedback on the short-wave radiation balance. Melt contributions from HK glaciers should increase until 2050 and then decrease, though a wide range of present-day area and volume estimates propagates large uncertainties in the future runoff. This review reflects an increasing understanding of HK glaciers and highlights the remaining challenges.

J	CATLING, PM; BROWNELL, VR				CATLING, PM; BROWNELL, VR			A REVIEW OF THE ALVARS OF THE GREAT-LAKES REGION - DISTRIBUTION, FLORISTIC COMPOSITION, BIOGEOGRAPHY AND PROTECTION	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												Alvars are naturally open areas of thin soil over essentially flat limestone or marble rock with a more or less sparse vegetation cover of shrubs and herbs with trees absent or at least not forming a continuous canopy. Drought and extremes of soil moisture are major factors limiting tree cover. Alvars are important as sites for (1) the protection of biodiversity including threatened plant communities, rare and threatened species of flora and fauna, and germplasm of crop relatives; (2) biological research and environmental monitoring; and (3) ecotourism. Approximately 85% of alvar sires and more than 90% of alvar landscape area in the Great Lakes region is in southern Ontario. With the exception of small isolated areas, most notably western Lake Erie and Lake Champlain area, the alvars of the Great Lakes region occur near the contact line of the granitic Canadian Shield upland with the Ordovician and Silurian limestones and dolomites. The main area of occurrence extends from the north shore of Lake Michigan east to the islands of northern Lake Huron, such as Drummond Island, east across Manitoulin Island, southeast to the south end of Georgian Bay, east to the Lake Simcoe area and the Garden limestone plain, discontinuously east to the Napanee limestone plain between Trenton and Kingston, then, following a gap due to the Frontenac axis of granitic rocks, and/or Lake Ontario, appearing again in New York State at the east end of Lake Ontario and on the Smiths Falls limestone plain in the Ottawa Valley. A list of 347 vascular plant taxa found on alvars in seven alvar regions is included based on examination of 59 sites in Ontario, one in Ohio and three in New York State, as well as on the literature and on personal communications. On the basis of floristic composition and environmental factors, alvars may be divided into two types: shoreline alvars along rivers and lakes and plateau alvars. Four major plant communities related to soil depth and moisture availability are identified on plateau alvars: alvar grassland, alvar pavement, alvar savanna and pavement ridge. Biodiversity is highest on the alvars of western Lake Erie, Manitoulin Island and the Napanee Plain. The alvar floras of seven regions are apparent as three major groups in both a phenogram and in the principal coordinate plot derived from a matrix of Jaccard's coefficients: (1) the western Lake Erie alvars with a proportionally high component of plant species occurring to the south, but a relatively small proportion occuring to the north; (2) the alvars of the Bruce Peninsula and Manitoulin Island with a high proportion of northern and endemic plant species at the expense of southern species; and (3) the alvars of central Ontario, eastern Ontario and northern New York with a moderate representation of plant species occurring also to the north, but the major proportion being southern species. The endemics and boreal elements of the northern Lake Huron alvars are probable relicts of the Picea Parkland and tundra-like environments that existed in front of the Wisconsin glacier more than 9000 years ago, and the alvars of this region are of great interest in their apparent similarity to the periglacial environment. The primarily western species on alvars may have also originated from this environment or may have migrated along pathways of open habitat that extended from western North America eastward into the Great Lakes region during glacial or postglacial times. Although some of the best alvars in the Great Lakes region are protected, not enough sites are protected to achieve adequate representation.																			0008-3550					APR-JUN	1995	109	2					143	171																WOS:A1995TB34800001

Exploiting simulation model results in parameterising a Bayesian network - A case study of dissolved organic carbon in catchment runoff	MODSIM 2005: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING					International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM05)	DEC 12-15, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA					This work is part of CLIME project (Climate and Lake Impacts in Europe), which assesses climate change effects on lake dynamics. In CLIME, a decision support system (CLIME-DSS) is based on a causal Bayesian network that summarises the most important relationships between climate variables and lake characteristics. A Bayesian network is a probabilistic graphical model, where nodes represent random variables and arcs between the nodes represent conditional dependencies. In a Bayesian network, relationship between the dependent variable and its explanatory variables is described for discrete variables as a conditional probability table (CPT). The aim of this study is to demonstrate how expert knowledge provided by researchers, and results of an environmental simulation model, are exploited in constructing a Bayesian network. A case study addresses the impact of climate change on concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in catchment runoff. The environmental simulation model is a DOC model (Jennings and Naden, 2004), which is coupled with the hydrological routine of the Generalized Watershed Loading Function (GWLF) model. The output of the model is the daily stream water DOC concentration and the daily load of DOC entering a lake. The DOC/GWLF model has been calibrated and validated against historical data from three catchments in Europe. A Bayesian network for describing interrelations between the climate and DOC concentrations is constructed on the basis of expert opinions and the structure of the DOC/GWLF simulation model. Those variables that are present both in the DOC model, and in the network structure based on the expert opinions, are included in the final structure of the Bayesian network. One Bayesian network is constructed for each of the three study sites. The GWLF/DOC model was run under a variety of climatic conditions using one set of calibrated parameter values at a time. The meteorological input variables were compiled from results of Regional Climate Models (RCM). Subsequently, the RCM and GWLF/DOC model results were analysed to compute conditional frequency tables for the links between each dependent node and its explanatory variables in the Bayesian network. The procedure of Kokkonen et al. (2005) was utilised to estimate link strength values from the conditional frequency information. The link strength values were optimised against the conditional frequencies determined from the model simulations. Finally, all values in the CPTs were generated using the optimised link strength values. In order to apply the Bayesian networks within the study region, RCM results are utilised for creating distributions of explanatory variables for all computation grid cells in Europe. The distributions are constructed for different scenarios characterising current and future climatic conditions. These spatial data on the climatic variables together with the Bayesian networks allow the CLIME-DSS users to study the predicted climate change effects across Europe. Three Bayesian networks were applied to predict how decomposition and summertime DOC concentrations change in the future in Lough Leane in Ireland. The application revealed that variability of the predicted annual decompositions and summer DOC concentrations was very different between the three Bayesian networks. The predicted direction of change in DOC concentrations, however, from the control scenario to the future climate scenario was same for all three Bayesian network parameterisations. The model application demonstrates how Bayesian networks can be used as diagnostics for assessing the conformity of model regionalisation.					; Koivusalo, Harri/I-5555-2012; Jolma, Ari/C-7534-2012; Kokkonen, Teemu/C-7490-2012; Varis, Olli/G-6506-2011	Kokkonen, Teemu/0000-0002-3381-089X; Koivusalo, Harri/0000-0002-3713-1579; Varis, Olli/0000-0001-9231-4549															978-0-9758400-2-3				2005							421	427																WOS:000290114100061

These are assumed to provide stability in time and space to those species. However, the role of microdiversity in the stability of whole microbial communities remains underexplored. Understanding the drivers of microbial community stability is necessary to predict community response to future disturbances. Here, we analyzed 16S rRNA gene amplicons from eight different temperate bog lakes at the 97% OTU and amplicon sequence variant (ASV) levels and found ecotypes within the same OTU with different distribution patterns in space and time. We observed that these ecotypes are adapted to different values of environmental factors such as water temperature and oxygen concentration. Our results showed that the existence of several ASVs within a OTU favored its persistence across changing environmental conditions. We propose that microdiversity aids the stability of microbial communities in the face of fluctuations in environmental factors.

Iestyn; Piao, Shilong; Jeppesen, Erik			Climate change drives rapid warming and increasing heatwaves of lakes	SCIENCE BULLETIN												Climate change could seriously threaten global lake ecosystems by warming lake surface water and increasing the occurrence of lake heatwaves. Yet, there are great uncertainties in quantifying lake temperature changes globally due to a lack of accurate large-scale model simulations. Here, we integrated satellite observations and a numerical model to improve lake temperature modeling and explore the multifaceted characteristics of trends in surface temperatures and lake heatwave occurrence in Chinese lakes from 1980 to 2100. Our model-data integration approach revealed that the lake surface waters have warmed at a rate of 0.11 & DEG;C 10a-1 during the period 1980-2021, being only half of the pure model-based estimate. Moreover, our analysis suggested that an asymmetric seasonal warming rate has led to a reduced temperature seasonality in eastern plain lakes but an amplified one in alpine lakes. The durations of lake heatwaves have also increased at a rate of 7.7 d 10a-1. Under the high-greenhouse-gasemission scenario, lake surface temperature and lake heatwave duration were projected to increase by 2.2 & DEG;C and 197 dat the end of the 21st century, respectively. Such drastic changes would worsen the environmental conditions of lakes subjected to high and increasing anthropogenic pressures, posing great threats to aquatic biodiversity and human health. & COPY; 2023 Science China Press.

However, large uncertainties remain in the projections of streamflow and glaciers in these cryospheric catchments due to great uncertainties in climate change projection and modeling processes. In this work, we developed an extended Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macroscale hydrological model (named VIC-CAS), which was coupled with glacier melting and glacier evolution schemes. A two-stage calibration procedure that used glacier inventory data and the observed streamflow was adopted to derive the model parameters. The calibrated VIC-CAS model was then used to assess the future change in glaciers and runoff using downscaled climate model data in the upstream regimes of the Yellow, Yangtze, Mekong, Salween, and Brahmaputra rivers on the TP. The results indicated that both temperature and precipitation were projected to increase, resulting in a greater than 50% decline of the glacier area by the end of the 21st century in the five catchments. Glacier runoff was already beyond its tipping point at the beginning of the 21st century with a greater than 20% loss of the glacier area except in the upstream of the Yangtze River, where glacier runoff was projected to decrease after the 2030 s. Annual streamflow was projected to increase significantly as a result of increased rainfall-induced runoff, compensating for the reduced glacier/snow melt water in the five major upstream river basins. The increasing rate of warm season streamflow was clearly less than that of annual runoff. A negative trend in warm season streamflow was expected if precipitation did not sufficiently increase. The annual hydrograph remained largely unchanged, except in the upstream of the Yellow River, where peak streamflow was predicted to occur 1 month earlier because of the earlier snowmelt and greater rainfall/precipitation ratio from May to June.

C	Foster, RS		Castronovo, JP; Clark, JA		Foster, RS			Surge protection design for the city and county of San Francisco water transmission system	PIPELINES IN THE CONSTRUCTED ENVIRONMENT					1998 Pipeline Division Conference, in Conjunction with the Prestressed Concrete Cylinder Pipe (PCCP) Users Forum on Pipelines in the Constructed Environment	AUG 23-27, 1998	SAN DIEGO, CA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Pipeline Div				The City and County of San Francisco were concerned about the ability of their water transmission system's ability to withstand pressure surges resulting from the unplanned operation of their system flow control valves and their two primary pump stations, Lake Merced and Baden. Flow Science Incorporated was hired to determine the extent of the surges in the system and recommend alternatives to keep the maximum hydraulic gradelines within the system below 130 percent of the maximum static pressure within the system. The transmission system consists of two main pump stations, (Lake Merced and Baden), the Tracy water treatment plant, flow control valves R60, T60, R20, and T20, and is constructed of many different pipeline materials of varying diameters. The system was constructed from around 1900 through to the 1980's and is designed to provide potable water to the City and County of San Francisco. The maximum total flows into the system can run as high as approximately 6308 l/s (100,000 gpm). There are five storage reservoirs to which the water from the pump stations and the WTP flow. The system is divided into two pressure zones: (1) the low pressure zone, which is served directly by the Upper Crystal Springs Reservoir and is located upstream of the two pump stations, and (2) the high pressure zone, which is served by the two pump stations and the Tracy Water Treatment Plant. The analysis showed that the loss of power to the two pump stations created surges in the system that raised the maximum HGL elevations within some of the main transmission pipelines well in excess of 130 percent of the maximum static pressure that was used as the upper limit for allowable pressures. The existing surge protection that was installed at the Lake Merced pump station did little to lower these pressures due to the configuration of the surge tank connection. It did however change the problem from a waterhammer problem to a surge problem. Protection was to be designed to prevent the maximum HGL elevations from exceeding the 130 percent of maximum static pressure threshold. However, it was determined through a series of simulations with various protection measures that this would not be feasible. The best solution would be to limit the pressures as close as possible to the allowable level. The surge protection alternative that was determined to provide the most protection to the system was the installation of a 28.3 m(3) (1000 ft(3)) surge tank on the discharge side of the Lake Merced pump station and a 610-mm (24-inch) surge relief valve on the suction side of the Lake Merced pump station. The surge relief valve is designed to work in combination with the existing surge tank at this location. At the Baden pump station a 127.4 m(3) (4500 ft(3)) surge tank was required on the discharge side of the pump station and a 42.5 m(3) (1500 ft(3)) surge tank was required on the suction side of the surge tank. The installation of the surge protection measures described above were predicted to provide the system with protection that would keep the maximum pressures as near to the 130 percent of the maximum static pressures for the system as possible.																					0-7844-0372-4				1998							103	112																WOS:000081694700012

However, a quantitative analysis about impacts of lake warming on the internal nutrient cycling in eutrophic lakes is limited. In this study, monthly nutrient monitoring data set in 2015-2016 in eutrophic Lake Chaohu, China, revealed a regular seasonal pattern of nutrient concentration. A process-based water quality model was established to quantify contributions from internal loadings on seasonal nutrient variations and predict responses under climate change scenarios. Results indicated that internal nutrient loading was responsible for the intra-annual variations of nutrient concentrations in the lake, and the internal loadings fluctuated much more between different seasons than the external nutrient inputs. We predicted that lake warming might probably result in stronger seasonal fluctuations of internal loading and create conditions beneficial for longer duration of cyanobacteria blooms in the year. Evidence derived from this study could help water managers to rethink the existing mitigation strategies in the restoration of eutrophic lakes and emphasize the potential interactions among lake warming, eutrophication and internal nutrient cycling in the future.

FPV systems offer several advantages over traditional land-based solar arrays, including increased land-use efficiency, reduced water evaporation, and improved cooling and maintenance. However, like all solar power systems, FPVs are subject to variability and intermittency due to changes in weather, seasons, and time of day. The environmental impact is discussed along with the deployment consideration and the feasibility for a better understanding of the system. Challenges associated with this are addressed by progressed research suggesting the integration of FPVs with various energy storage and hybrid systems. The most promising areas researched in this paper look at hybrid FPV hydropower plants (HPP), in parts of the world experiencing droughts HPP is not working to its optimum capacity. A review of available literature has been conducted on the topic of offshore and onshore floating solar electricity generation using floating solar photovoltaics to identify the challenges and opportunities presented. This work looks at a variety of other hybrid FPV energy sources with varying technology readiness levels. This paper concludes with the possibility of integrating different renewable technologies with existing FPVs and highlights the boons of doing so with some examples. Ultimately, current as well as future perspectives have been provided which consolidate the current research being done and give recommendations for future research work.

A Review of the Current State and Recent Changes of the Andean Cryosphere	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												The Andes Cordillera contains the most diverse cryosphere on Earth, including extensive areas covered by seasonal snow, numerous tropical and extratropical glaciers, and many mountain permafrost landforms. Here, we review some recent advances in the study of the main components of the cryosphere in the Andes, and discuss the changes observed in the seasonal snow and permanent ice masses of this region over the past decades. The open access and increasing availability of remote sensing products has produced a substantial improvement in our understanding of the current state and recent changes of the Andean cryosphere, allowing an unprecedented detail in their identification and monitoring at local and regional scales. Analyses of snow cover maps has allowed the identification of seasonal patterns and long term trends in snow accumulation for most of the Andes, with some sectors in central Chile and central-western Argentina showing a clear decline in snowfall and snow persistence since 2010. This recent shortage of mountain snow has caused an extended, severe drought that is unprecedented in the hydrological and climatological records from this region. Together with data from global glacier inventories, detailed inventories at local/regional scales are now also freely available, providing important new information for glaciological, hydrological, and climatological assessments in different sectors of the Andes. Numerous studies largely based on field measurements and/or remote sensing techniques have documented the recent glacier shrinkage throughout the Andes. This observed ice mass loss has put Andean glaciers among the highest contributors to sea level rise per unit area. Other recent studies have focused on rock glaciers, showing that in extensive semi-arid sectors of the Andes these mountain permafrost features contain large reserves of freshwater and may play a crucial role as future climate becomes warmer and drier in this region. Many relevant issues remain to be investigated, however, including an improved estimation of ice volumes at local scales, and detailed assessments of the hydrological significance of the different components of the cryosphere in Andean river basins. The impacts of future climate changes on the Andean cryosphere also need to be studied in more detail, considering the contrasting climatic scenarios projected for each region. The sustained work of various monitoring programs in the different Andean countries is promising and will provide much needed field observations to validate and improve the analyses made from remote sensors and modeling techniques. In this sense, the development of a well-coordinated network of high-elevation hydro-meteorological stations appears as a much needed priority to complement and improve the many glaciological and hydro-climatological assessments that are being conducted across the Andes.					; Rabatel, Antoine/L-5249-2015; Pitte, Pierre/GLT-9746-2022; Berthier, Etienne/B-8900-2009; Bown, Francisca/ODI-7831-2025; Barcaza, Gonzalo/NNG-6074-2025; MacDonell, Shelley/J-2480-2016	Rabatel, Antoine/0000-0002-5304-1055; BARCAZA SEPULVEDA, GONZALO OSCAR ANTONIO/0009-0006-1098-5714; Soruco, Alvaro/0009-0008-2380-8148; Masiokas, Mariano/0009-0007-1437-415X; Pitte, Pierre/0000-0001-5625-8287; MacDonell, Shelley/0000-0001-9641-4547; Ruiz, Lucas/0000-0002-8837-436X; 														2296-6463				JUN 23	2020	8								99	10.3389/feart.2020.00099	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2020.00099													WOS:000548655000001
J	Gunin, VI				Gunin, V. I.			ASSESSMENT OF GAS-HYDROTHERMAL ACTIVITY OF THE BAIKAL RIFT IN THE LAKE AREA FROM NUMERICAL EXPERIMENT DATA	GEODYNAMICS & TECTONOPHYSICS												The Baikal rift is characterized by high heat flow, seismic activity and large thickness of sediments through which gas and hydrothermal water are intensely released into the lake water. In the area of the southern Baikal at the beginning of the 20th century, 'water pillars' were observed to reach almost a dozen metres height when earthquakes took place. This suggests potential uplift of significant amounts of gas from the lake's bottom into the atmosphere and confirms a relationship between seismicity and methane emissions. Moreover, strong emissions of gas take place in many regions of Lake Baikal, and when the lake is covered by ice, such phenomena can cause the occurrence of spots with melted ice wherein an effect of water 'boiling' is observed. In recent international space studies of the surface of ice covering Lake Baikal in spring periods, mysterious rings of 5 to 7 km in diameter were discovered. Causes and mechanisms of their occurrence have not been studied in detail yet. It is established that a ring-shaped structure results from an uplift of deep water which causes clock-wise vortex flows. Uplifting of deep water can accompany emissions of significant amounts of methane from sediments, activation of thermal vents or gas-water-mud volcanoes at the bottom of Lake Baikal. In order to reveal causes and conditions of the above-described phenomena, the author designed a 3D model of heat-and-mass transfer in viscous medium and used it for numerical simulations. Based on the obtained results, it is established that a ring-shaped structure is formed on ice of the lake by a toroid-shaped ascending convective flow that occurs due to horizontal and vertical gradients of density, and the central part of such a flow rotates in the counter-clockwise direction (i.e. cyclonic vortex), while its periphery parts rotate in the clockwise direction (i.e. anticyclonic vortex). Both hydrothermal vents and gas emissions can produce such ascending flows. Spots with melted ice can be formed when the temperature of hydrothermal vents amounts to 30-50 degrees C; such a melted-ice spot can stay open as long as the hydrothermal vent is active. With an assumption of 100 % concentration of gas in the source, the numerical simulation shows that during gas release into the atmosphere, a gas pillar can reach a height of 15 metres if the source of gas is active for a period no shorter than the time required for the gas flow to ascend through the water layer and to release into the air above the water surface. An area, wherein gas is released in bubbles, can be formed in case of lasting activity of a gas source wherein the volume of gas varies from 1 % to 20 % (i.e. gas-water mix).																			2078-502X						2014	5	3					763	775		10.5800/GT-2014-5-3-0153	http://dx.doi.org/10.5800/GT-2014-5-3-0153													WOS:000409781700010

CHOROS-GURKIN	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY												One of the central problems of cultural heritage is its preservation and promotion. Special attention should be paid to the museum-estate of the first professional artist in Siberia G.I. Choros-Gurkin located in the village Anos Chemalsky area of the Altai Republic. Grigory Choros-Gurkin (1870-1937) was an artist , a graduate of the icon painting studio of the Altai Spiritual Mission, a pupil of I.I. Shishkin, a representative of the St. Petersburg school of landscape art, brought up on the democratic traditions of Russian ideological realism of the late nineteenth - early twentieth centuries, a writer, and a public figure, an educator, a spokesman of spiritual aspiration of Altai people, the beauty and richness of the ancient land. The creative method G.I. Gurkin, based on the traditions of Russian landscape school, and a close, loving study of Altai nature and national culture, was decisive for the formation of fine art features of Altai. Gurkin's masterpieces like "Lake of Mountain Spirits ", " Khan-Altai " " Crown of Katun ", " Lake Karakol ", " Katun In the Spring ", " Belukha " and others reached a big fame. The study on the history, restoration and development prospects of the museum-estate was provided by the relatives V.G. Gurkin, P.I. Karalkin; museum workers V.V. Murrain, R.M. Erkinova; researchers V.I. Edokov, T.M. Stepanskaya, G.I. Pribytkov, the poet and public figure Y. Tudeneva etc. The Anos mansion, built at the expense of the artist in 1903, consisted of a dwelling house, an art studio , a six-sided ail , a large garden and a pond. It was the center of cultural development. The prominent representatives of culture and science like A.V. Anokhin, G.N. Potanin, G.D. Grebenshikov, V.Y. Shishkov, A.L. Koptelov, I. Efremov, G. Vyatkin, I.M. Tachalov, N.Y. Nikiforov, Repin's pupil S.M. Prokhorov, I.I. Tyutikov and others have visited the estate. The idea of creating an artistic center in the village Anos belongs to G.I. Choros-Gurkin. The attempts to revive the museum-estate of G.I.Choros - Gurkin were conducted in 1957, 1982, 1989. An extensive renovation of the mansion museum started in 2005. In 2006 it was awarded with the status of Memorial Museum. A historical landmark is the home of the artist that was built by selftaught masters who knew the secrets of building crafts. The workshop was restored too; now it features the reproductions of the first national landscape painter and offers guided tours for tourists. The plan for the reconstruction of the museum - estate was based on the recollections of his contemporaries, the son Vasiliy, the grandchildren of G.I.Gurkin, the villagers of Anos V.S. Keresheva, E.P. Krut'ko, E.E. Chechegoeva, E.P. Zakhar'eva, V.F. Tozyyakova etc. The landscape painter had found his inspiration in Altai nature, and therefore one of the main goals in the restoration of the museum-estate is recreation of the cultural landscape as in the lifetimes of the artist .																			2222-0836	2311-3685				JUN	2014	14	2					72	76																WOS:000440725200008
J	Kim, UJ; Kannan, K				Kim, Un-Jung; Kannan, Kurunthachalam			Occurrence and Distribution of Organophosphate Flame Retardants/Plasticizers in Surface Waters, Tap Water, and Rainwater: Implications for Human Exposure	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The occurrence and profiles of 14 triester organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) and plasticizers were investigated in surface water, tap water, rainwater, and seawater collected from New York State. In total, 150 samples collected from rivers (n = 35), lakes (n = 39), tap water (n = 58), precipitation/rainwater (n = 15), and seawater (n = 3) were analyzed for 14 organophosphate esters (OPEs). An additional nine Hudson River water samples were collected periodically to delineate seasonal trends in OPE levels. The total concentrations of OPEs were found at part-per-trillion ranges, with average concentrations that ranged from 0.01 ng/L for tripropyl phosphate (TPP) in river water to 689 ng/L for tris(2-butoxyethyl)phosphate (TBOEP) in lake water. Tris(1-chloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TCIPP) was the most abundant compound among the investigated OPEs in all types of water. The concentrations of OPEs in river-, lake-, and rainwater were similar but >3 times higher than those found in tap water. Chlorinated alkyl OPFRs accounted for a major proportion of total concentrations. TCIPP, TBOEP, and triethyl phosphate (TEP) were found in >90% of the samples analyzed. Wet deposition fluxes for 14 OPFRs were estimated, on the basis of the concentrations measured in rainwater in Albany, New York, and the values were between 440 and 5250 ng/m(2). Among several surface water bodies analyzed, samples from the Hudson River and Onondaga Lake contained elevated concentrations of OPEs. Estimated daily intake of OPEs via the ingestion of drinking water was up to 9.6S ng/kg body weight/day.					; Kim, Un-Jung/AAI-3695-2020; Kannan, Kurunthachalam/ACA-0037-2022	Kim, Un-Jung/0000-0001-5666-8649; Kannan, Kurunthachalam/0000-0002-1926-7456													0013-936X	1520-5851				MAY 15	2018	52	10					5625	5633		10.1021/acs.est.8b00727	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b00727								29659254					WOS:000432417400013

Yoshi; Alves, Daiana; Gonda, Regina; Robinson, Mark; de Souza, Jonas Gregorio; Watling, Jennifer; Handley, Josephine			The origins of Amazonian landscapes: Plant cultivation, domestication and the spread of food production in tropical South America	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												During the last two decades, new archaeological projects which systematically integrate a variety of plant recovery techniques, along with palaeoecology, palaeoclimate, soil science and floristic inventories, have started to transform our understanding of plant exploitation, cultivation and domestication in tropical South America. Archaeobotanical studies are providing a far greater appreciation of the role of plants in the diets of early colonists. Since similar to 13ka, these diets relied mainly on palm, tree fruits, and underground tubers, along with terrestrial and riverine faunal resources. Recent evidence indicates two areas of precocious plant cultivation and domestication: the sub-Andean montane forest of NW South America and the shrub savannahs and seasonal forests of SW Amazonia. In the latter area, thousands of anthropic keystone structures represented by forest islands show a significant human footprint in Amazonia from the start of the Holocene. While radiocarbon date databases show a decline in population during the middle Holocene, important developments happened during this epoch, including the domestication of cacao, the adoption of maize and the spread of manioc across the basin. The late Holocene witnessed the domestication of rice and the development of agricultural landscapes characterised by raised fields and Amazonian Dark Earths (ADEs). Our multi-proxy analysis of 23 late Holocene ADEs and two lakes from southern Amazonia provides the first direct evidence of field polyculture agriculture including the cultivation of maize, manioc, sweet potato, squash, arrowroot and leren within closed-canopy forest, as well as enrichment with palms, limited clearing for crop cultivation, and low-severity fire management. Collectively, the evidence shows that during the late Holocene Amazonian farmers engaged in intensive agriculture marked by the cultivation of both annual and perennial crops relying on organic amendments requiring soil preparation and maintenance. Our study has broader implications for sustainable Amazonian futures. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The State and Fate of Himalayan Glaciers	SCIENCE												Himalayan glaciers are a focus of public and scientific debate. Prevailing uncertainties are of major concern because some projections of their future have serious implications for water resources. Most Himalayan glaciers are losing mass at rates similar to glaciers elsewhere, except for emerging indications of stability or mass gain in the Karakoram. A poor understanding of the processes affecting them, combined with the diversity of climatic conditions and the extremes of topographical relief within the region, makes projections speculative. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that dramatic changes in total runoff will occur soon, although continuing shrinkage outside the Karakoram will increase the seasonality of runoff, affect irrigation and hydropower, and alter hazards.

However, the role of topography in controlling the flow transformation and sediments aggradation has been less studied. This constrain studies of sediment distribution and understanding of graded profile. For lake basin sequences, geomorphological control is much stronger than lake level rise and fall. Under extreme conditions, sediments can still prograde when the lake level rises. Therefore, describing the influence of geomorphology on the flow transformation and stacking pattern of the lobes can provide a deeper understanding of the controlling factors of the lake basin stratigraphy sequence. Xiligou lake (XLG) fan delta from Xisai Basin provides an optimal case for addressing this issue. Three lobes developed on the XLG fan delta with significant differences in their morphologies, architectures, lithofacies, sediment distributions and topographies. Through trenching, drone photography, and satellite data, we analyzed the structure of the sediments and the distribution of sedimentary facies. Based on the analysis of debris flow and hyper-concentrated flow deposits, two transformation models corresponding to different topographies were established. Sediment unloading is caused by a frictional reduction or a sudden momentum loss in the sediments flow's carrying capacity, allowing the debris flow transforms to hyper-concentrated flow and then to stream flow during the movement. The role of topography in controlling sediment flow transformation and sediment distribution is clarified through forces analysis of sediment grain. The topographic gradient of the linear slope is constant, so the direction of fluid movement is consistent with the topographic direction. Therefore, sediment flows move on linear slope without collision with the bed and there is no sudden loss of momentum. The gradual or sudden reduction in topographic gradient of concave slopes forces a constant or sudden change in the direction of fluid movement, which facilitates the unloading of sediments and the transformation of flow. The sudden change of topography forces unloading of viscous component, and the non-viscous component pass over to form hyper-concentrated flow, often accompanied by remobilized large gravels. The graded profile was an equilibrium between the dynamics and resistance of sediment transport. Changes in lake level affect the graded profile by changing the elevation of sediment transport, which is the total gravitational potential energy. The instantaneous graded profile and temporary graded profile are different scales of equilibrium corresponding to hydrodynamic equilibrium and depositional trend respectively. This study reveals the role of geomorphological dynamics in controlling sedimentary body progradation, thus providing a new perspective on the analysis of lake basin stratigraphy sequence.

Current maps of global wetland extent vary in their wetland definition, causing substantial disagreement between and large uncertainty in estimates of wetland methane emissions. To reconcile these differences for large-scale wetland CH4 modeling, we developed the global Wetland Area and Dynamics for Methane Modeling (WAD2M) version 1.0 dataset at a similar to 25 km resolution at the Equator (0.25 degrees) at a monthly time step for 2000-2018. WAD2M combines a time series of surface inundation based on active and passive microwave remote sensing at a coarse resolution with six static datasets that discriminate inland waters, agriculture, shoreline, and non-inundated wetlands. We excluded all permanent water bodies (e.g., lakes, ponds, rivers, and reservoirs), coastal wetlands (e.g., mangroves and sea grasses), and rice paddies to only represent spatiotem-poral patterns of inundated and non-inundated vegetated wetlands. Globally, WAD2M estimates the long-term maximum wetland area at 13 :0 x 106 km(2) (13.0Mkm(2)), which can be divided into three categories: mean annual minimum of inundated and non-inundated wetlands at 3.5Mkm(2), seasonally inundated wetlands at 4.0Mkm(2) (mean annual maximum minus mean annual minimum), and intermittently inundated wetlands at 5.5Mkm(2) (long-term maximum minus mean annual maximum). WAD2M shows good spatial agreements with independent wetland inventories for major wetland complexes, i.e., the Amazon Basin lowlands and West Siberian lowlands, with Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.54 and 0.70 respectively among multiple wetland products. By evaluating the temporal variation in WAD2M against modeled prognostic inundation (i.e., TOPMODEL) and satellite observations of inundation and soil moisture, we show that it adequately represents interannual variation as well as the effect of El Nino-Southern Oscillation on global wetland extent.

Here, by using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing of 60 water samples collected during different hydrological seasons, we investigated the spatio-temporal variation and the co-occurrence patterns of microbial communities in the anthropogenically impacted Jiulong River in China. The results indicated that the riverine microbial co-occurrence network had a nonrandom, modular structure, which was mainly shaped by the taxonomic relatedness of co-occurring species. Fecal indicator bacteria may survive for prolonged periods of time in river water, but they formed an independent module which had fewer interactions with typical freshwater bacteria. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that nutrients and micropollutants [i.e., pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs)] exerted combined effects in shaping - and -diversity of riverine microbial communities. Remarkably, we showed that a hitherto unrecognized disruptive effect of PPCPs on the abundance variations of central species and module communities was stronger than the influence of physicochemical factors, suggesting the key role played by micropollutants for the microbial co-occurrence relationships in lotic ecosystems. Overall, our findings provide novel insights into community assembly in aquatic environments experiencing anthropogenic stresses.

J	COWGILL, UM				COWGILL, UM			THE WATERS OF MEROM - A STUDY OF LAKE HULEH .9. THE MINOR CHEMICAL-CONSTITUENTS OF A 54-M CORE	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												This paper concerns the minor chemical constituents of a 54-meter core taken in Lake Huleh, the first lake the river Jordan used to make. The sedimentary record previously elucidated, is divided into two main Periods: Period A, which has been subdivided into 8 subperiods, represents a rather shallow lake that was swamPY and supported aquatic plants most of the time; Period B represents a deeper well-formed lake that was divided into 5 subperiods. Elemental composition of basalt and limestone, the two major rocks surrounding the lake, show that contributions to the mud representing Period A were largely basaltic in origin while those of Period B were mostly from limestone. The elements detected (46) fall into three main groups: I, positively and statistically significantly related to Ti, namely Na, K, Cs, Be, Mg, Zn, B, Al, Si, Sn, Zr, Hf, P, Bi, V, Nb, Cr, Fe, Mn, Co, Ni, and during Period B only Rb, Li, Cu, Ba, Ga, La, Ce, Ge, Pb, As, Mo, Br and I; II, negatively and statistically significantly related to Ti, namely Ca, Sr, Ag, Cd, Sc, Y, S, Cl and during Period A only Cu, Ge, As, Se, Mo and Br and only F during Period B; III, not significantly related to Ti, namely Hg and during Period A Rb, Li, Ba, Ga, Pb, La, Ce, F and I. These relationships have been further analyzed by partial and multiple correlation techniques. A mud-water interface study carried out in the Huleh Preserve revealed that elements were sorbed by the mud from the liquid portion of the mud-water interface by two methods: organic matter sorption (Br, Cd) and by the scavenger action of ferric hydroxide type complexes (Cs, Sn, Be, Hg, Ti, Zr, Bi, V, Mo, I). It was found that Br was related to organic matter for all 13 subperiods, but Cd was intimately associated with organic matter for the 8 subperiods of Period A but only the more shallow subperiods of Period B, namely B-1, B-2 and B-5. Caesium, Be, Sn, Ti, Bi, V and Hg were associated with Fe during all 13 subperiods. Zirconium, Mo and I are related to Fe for each of the 5 subperiods, but only during the early lacustrine episodes of Period A, namely A-2 and A-6. It is clear from these results that the chemical activities proceeding in the mud-water interface exert a continuous effect on the chemical life of the lake. A summary of the entire interdisciplinary study of Core III is presented. This study showed that Period A represents a relatively unproductive swamp that basically consisted of two lacustrine episodes with intervening peaty periods. Period B began 20 200 years ago and represents a gradual development from a moderately productive lake to a very productive lake. Thus, Lake Huleh has indeed provided a record that gives evidence of a purely internal maturation from oligotrophy to eutrophy.																			0003-9136					JAN	1994		1-2		99			97	153																WOS:A1994PB25500004
C	Cipolla, K; Keith, W; Foley, A			IEEE	Cipolla, Kimberly; Keith, William; Foley, Alia			SPIV Measurements of Axisymmetric Turbulent Boundary Layers	OCEANS 2010	OCEANS-IEEE				Washington State Conference and Trade Center (WSCTC)	SEP 20-23, 2010	Seattle, WA	IEEE, Marine Technol, OES				This paper presents a description of turbulent boundary layer velocity measurements made on an experimental towed array during testing at the David Taylor Model Basin, Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division in June 2007. The experimental array had an aspect ratio L/a = 7 x 10(3) and was towed at Reynolds numbers Re. varying from 4.6 x 105 to 8.9 x 105. This range falls well outside that which has been investigated to date in laboratories or with computational fluid dynamics. Previous lake tests of this array were performed and documented in Cipolla and Keith [1]. However, details of the high Reynolds turbulent boundary layer were not obtained during these tests. The goal of the follow-on tow tank testing was to obtain measurements of the mean and turbulent flow field which are not feasible in lake or sea trial testing. A stationary stereo-particle image velocimetry (SPIV) system was used to obtain three-dimensional velocity measurements and evaluate the boundary layer flow development along full-scale fleet towed array modules. Measurements were collected at discrete transverse planes along the length at tow speeds between 6.2 and 15.4 m/s. Algorithms for image pre-processing and filtering were applied to enhance the instantaneous images and mask the array and its shadow. The data will be analyzed to extract mean velocity profiles and compared with wind tunnel measurements on cylinders [2]. Further, relevant boundary layer parameters will be used to refine the scaling of the wall pressure measurements obtained simultaneously as reported by [3]. Independent load cell measurements of the total drag on the towed model provided the momentum thickness at the end of the model and the spatially-averaged friction velocity ut. These data supplement the SPIV data near the array wall, completing the velocity profile over the entire boundary layer. The load cell also provided a highly accurate value of the mean wall shear stress which is traditionally very difficult to obtain. The velocity profiles can be compared with existing models for the mean velocity which include the velocity defect law and Clauser's log law. In particular, the velocity defect law is expected to provide the best collapse of the data in the outer region of the boundary layer, while the log law relation is expected to provide a good collapse very close to the surface of the towed array (near wall region). Trends in the data with Reynolds number will be evaluated. In addition, the boundary layer thickness and mean wall shear stress at particular streamwise locations along the array will be quantified. The growth of the turbulent boundary layer over the length of the array is an important metric with regard to estimating the maximum turbulent boundary layer thickness which exists over a fleet towed array. The underlying structure of the axisymmetric boundary layer, which leads to significant increases in wall shear stress with respect to flat plate cases, is of primary importance. These new insights will facilitate efforts toward towed array reliability and an accurate prediction of drag and flow noise for any towed array application.																			0197-7385		978-1-4244-4333-8				2010																								WOS:000287539100010

The research integrates a variety of exploration data, including field outcrops, drilling, logging, core samples, geochemical analyses, and flume simulation. The study indicates that: (1) The paleoenvironment of the Chang 73 deposition is characterized by a warm and humid climate, frequent monsoon events, and a large water depth of freshwater lacustrine basin. The paleogeomorphology exhibits an asymmetrical pattern, with steep slopes in the southwest and gentle slopes in the northeast, which can be subdivided into microgeomorphological units, including depressions and ridges in lakebed, as well as ancient channels. (2) The Chang 73 sub-member is characterized by a diverse array of fine-grained sediments, including very fine sandstone, siltstone, mudstone and tuff. These sediments are primarily distributed in thin interbedded and laminated arrangements vertically. The overall grain size of the sandstone predominantly falls below 62.5 mu m, with individual layer thicknesses of 0.05-0.64 m. The deposits contain intact plant fragments and display various sedimentary structure, such as wavy bedding, inverse-to-normal grading sequence, and climbing ripple bedding, which indicating a depositional origin associated with density flows. (3) Flume simulation experiments have successfully replicated the transport processes and sedimentary characteristics associated with density flows. The initial phase is characterized by a density-velocity differential, resulting in a thicker, coarser sediment layer at the flow front, while the upper layers are thinner and finer in grain size. During the mid-phase, sliding water effects cause the fluid front to rise and facilitate rapid forward transport. This process generates multiple "new fronts", enabling the long-distance transport of fine-grained sandstones, such as siltstone and argillaceous silt- stone, into the center of the lake basin. (4) A sedimentary model primarily controlled by hyperpynal flows was established for the southwestern part of the basin, highlighting that the frequent occurrence of flood events and the steep slope topography in this area are primary controlling factors for the development of hyperpynal flows. (5) Sandstone and mudstone in the Chang 73 sub-member exhibit micro- and nano-scale pore-throat systems, shale oil is present in various lithologies, while the content of movable oil varies considerably, with sandstone exhibiting the highest content of movable oil. (6) The fine-grained sediment complexes formed by multiple episodes of sandstones and mudstones associated with density flow in the Chang 73 formation exhibit characteristics of "overall oil-bearing with differential storage capacity". The combination of mudstone with low total organic carbon content (TOC) and siltstone is identified as the most favorable exploration target at present.																			2096-4803	1876-3804				FEB	2025	52	1					95	111		10.1016/S1876-3804(25)60007-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1876-3804(25)60007-3													WOS:001447653900001

The evaluation helps to identify the level of water resources exposure to the changes that could help to plan for potential adaptive capacity. In this research, Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov in IDRISI software was used to predict the future LULC scenarios and the ensemble mean of four regional climate models (RCMs) in the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment (CORDEX)-Africa was used for the future climate scenarios. Distribution mapping was used to bias correct the RCMs outputs, with respect to the observed precipitation and temperature. Then, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to evaluate the watershed hydrological responses of the catchment under separate, and combined, LULC and climate change. The result shows the ensemble mean of the four RCMs reported precipitation decline and increase in future temperature under both representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The increases in both maximum and minimum temperatures are higher for higher emission scenarios showing that RCP8.5 projection is warmer than RCP4.5. The changes in LULC brings an increase in surface runoff and water yield and a decline in groundwater, while the projected climate change shows a decrease in surface runoff, groundwater and water yield. The combined study of LULC and climate change shows that the effect of the combined scenario is similar to that of climate change only scenario. The overall decline of annual flow is due to the decline in the seasonal flows under combined scenarios. This could bring the reduced availability of water for crop production, which will be a chronic issue of subsistence agriculture. The possibility of surface water and groundwater reduction could also affect the availability of water resources in the catchment and further aggravate water stress in the downstream. The highly rising demands of water, owing to socio-economic progress, population growth and high demand for irrigation water downstream, in addition to the variability temperature and evaporation demands, amplify prolonged water scarcity. Consequently, strong land-use planning and climate-resilient water management policies will be indispensable to manage the risks.					; Dibaba, Dr.-Ing Wakjira Takala/JCE-4838-2023	Dibaba, Dr.-Ing Wakjira Takala/0000-0002-9359-2142; 														2073-4441				JUN	2020	12	6							1801	10.3390/w12061801	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12061801													WOS:000554619200001

Improving our understanding of the dynamics of MP pollution in freshwater ecosystems is therefore a prerequisite for managing and limiting this pollution. In this study, we quantified the spatial and temporal variability of MP (size range 700 mu m - 5 mm) pollution in surface water in 14 sites located across the Garonne river catchment (Southwestern France, 6 in the main river and 8 tributaries). MP concentration averaged 0.15 particles.m(-3) (+/- 0.46 SD) and strongly varied both in space and in time. We found that the spatial variation in MP concentration was driven by urbanization and that the temporal variation in MP concentration and MP size was driven by hydrological conditions, with higher concentrations and smaller particles sizes in warm seasons with low discharge. Polyethylene (44.5%), polystyrene (30.1%) and polypropylene (182%) were the main polymers and their proportion did not vary significantly across sampled sites. Particle color was associated with polymer type, with a high proportion of white particles in polystyrene. We also found a significant and negative relationship between MP size and the distance to the source in sites located in the main stream. MP pollution across watershed, from headwater tributaries to lowland rivers, is dynamic, and further studies are needed to improve the resolution of our knowledge of spatial and temporal patterns of MP pollution in freshwater ecosystems.

As the population increases and more chemical products are manufactured, the level of microplastic pollution continues to increase. Microplastics discharged from sewage treatment systems will enter the ocean and rivers, so estuary ecosystems are vital to controlling marine microplastics. As the estuary of China's most significant river entering the East China Sea, the Changjiang River Estuary has become one of the typical areas for microplastic research in estuaries. This paper systematically reviews the sources, hazards, and impacts of microplastics in the Changjiang Estuary. Firstly, the research on microplastics in the Changjiang Estuary was analyzed, and we found that the bioaccumulation, removal, and interaction with microorganisms of microplastics have become a new research hotspot. At the same time, the current abundance of microplastics in the surface water of the Changjiang River Estuary is 1.71 +/- 3.12 MP/L, which is lower than that of the Changjiang River area and the river farmland in Shanghai, but still higher than the 0.22 +/- 0.27 MP/L in the area adjacent to the East China Sea. Microplastics smaller than 1000 mu m accounted for 68% of the total, while transparent, white, blue, and black were the primary colors of microplastics in the Changjiang Estuary. In addition, polyethylene and polypropylene are the primary materials of microplastics in the central Changjiang River Estuary and related water bodies, and fibers are the main shape of microplastics. Industry, agriculture, domestic sewage, and air deposition may be the primary sources of microplastics in the Changjiang Estuary. The numerous lakes and water conservancy facilities in the Changjiang River Basin can reduce the number of microplastics reaching the Changjiang Estuary to a certain extent. At the same time, seasonal rainfall and ocean currents will affect the abundance of microplastics in the surface waters of the Changjiang River Estuary. Finally, this paper puts forward relevant suggestions based on the actual situation of the Changjiang River Estuary and the developed microplastic treatment technologies. This article will provide a structured reference for future research on microplastics in the Changjiang Estuary and assist in assessing microplastics' impact on the ecological environment.

In this study, the region is divided into five structural domains with distinct, but related, histories: (1) The southern Panamint domain is a structurally intact, gently south-tilted block dominated by a middle Miocene volcanic center recognized as localized hypabyssal intrusives surrounded by proximal facies pyroclastic rocks. This Miocene volcanic sequence is an unusual alkaline volcanic assemblage ranging from trachybasalt to rhyolite, but dominated by trachyandesite. The volcanic rocks are overlain in the southwestern Panamint Mountains by a younger (Late Miocene?) fanglomerate sequence. (2) An upper Wingate Wash domain is characterized by large areas of Quaternary cover and complex overprinting of older structure by Quaternary deformation. Quaternary structures record similar to N-S shortening concurrent with similar to E-W extension accommodated by systems of strike-slip and thrust faults. (3) A central Wingate Wash domain contains a complex structural history that is closely tied to the stratigraphic evolution. In this domain, a middle Miocene volcanic package contains two distinct assemblages; a lower sequence dominated by alkaline pyroclastic rocks similar to the southern Panamint sequence and an upper basaltic sequence of alkaline basalt and basanites. This volcanic sequence is in turn overlain by a coarse clastic sedimentary sequence that records the unroofing of adjacent ranges and development of similar to N-S trending, west-tilted fault blocks. We refer to this sedimentary sequence as the Lost Lake assemblage. (4) The lower Wingate Wash/northern Owlshead domain is characterized by a gently north-dipping stratigraphic sequence with an irregular unconformity at the base developed on granitic basement. The unconformity is locally overlain by channelized deposits of older Tertiary(?) red conglomerate, some of which predate the onset of extensive volcanism, but in most of the area is overlain by a moderately thick package of Middle Miocene trachybasalt, trachyandesitic, ash flows, lithic tuff, basaltic cinder, basanites, and dacitic pyroclastic, debris, and lahar flows with localized exposures of sedimentary rocks. The upper part of the Miocene stratigraphic sequence in this domain is comprised of coarse grained-elastic sediments that are apparently middle Miocene based on Ar/Ar dating of interbedded volcanic rocks. This sedimentary sequence, however, is lithologically indistinguishable from the structurally adjacent Late Miocene Lost Lake assemblage and a stratigraphically overlying Plio-Pleistocene alluvial fan; a relationship that handicaps tracing structures through this domain. This domain is also structurally complex and deformed by a series of northwest-southeast-striking, east-dipping, high-angle oblique, sinistral, normal faults that are cut by left-lateral strike-slip faults. The contact between the southern Panamint domain and the adjacent domains is a complex fault system that we interpret as a zone of Late Miocene distributed sinistral slip that is variably overprinted in different portions of the mapped area. The net sinistral slip across the Wingate Wash fault system is estimated at 7-9 km, based on offset of Proterozoic Crystal Springs Formation beneath the middle Miocene unconformity to as much as 15 kin based on offset volcanic facies in Middle Miocene rocks. To the south of Wingate Wash, the northern Owlshead Mountains are also cut by a sinistral, northwest-dipping, oblique normal fault, (referred to as the Filtonny Fault) with significant slip that separates the Lower Wingate Wash and central Owlshead domains. The Filtonny Fault may represent a young conjugate fault to the dextral Southern Death Valley fault system and may be the northwest-dipping fault imaged by COCORP studies. Similarly, younger deformation in upper Wingate Wash is probably broadly related to distributed dextral shear along the Panamint Valley fault system. Earlier deformation (Late Miocene?) is more difficult to constrain because of overprinting but appears to be dominated by an E-W extension recognized by a NNW-striking, northeast-dipping, sinistral-oblique normal faults, similar to N-S striking normal faults that splay in the northern Owlshead Mountains and include the large west-tilted fault blocks of the northern Owlshead Mountains.

In particular, 114 current-use pesticides were measured in samples collected during four campaigns spread across the wet, dry, and normal seasons. Pesticide concentrations were measured by means of a novel analytical method involving online solid-phase extraction coupled to LC-MS/MS. In total, 1 plant growth regulator, 34 herbicides, 23 insecticides, and 25 fungicides were detected. Detection frequencies greater than 90% were recorded for 26 pesticides; furthermore, acetamiprid, azoxystrobin, bentazone, carbendazim, isoprothiolane, metolachlor, paclobutrazol, and triadimenol were present in every sample. The measured pesticide concentrations varied widely, from below the detection limit to 10,600 ng/L (tricyclazole). The highest median concentrations for the fungicide, herbicide, and insecticide families were observed for carbendazim (135 ng/L), metolachlor (40 ng/L), and imidacloprid (31 ng/L), respectively. Twentytwo pesticides were quantitatively reported in Chinese surface water for the first time. The number and concentration of detected pesticides were significantly higher in June and September (wet season) compared to March and December (dry season). Agricultural areas of the study area were more contaminated than the residential and industrial sections. Imidacloprid was the only pesticide that exhibited high risk to sensitive ecological species (RQmedian > 1) in all four seasons. Isoproturon, isoprothiolane, and pretilachlor were identified as high risk in March (RQmedian= 4.5), September (1.3), and June (1.1), respectively; moreover, another eight pesticides posed a high ecological risk at specific sites. Seven pesticides recorded moderate risks (i.e., RQmedian= 0.1-1.0). Of the 18 pesticides with cases of high risk, a novel risk index, which accounted for frequency of PNEC exceedance, ranged from 6.7 (imidacloprid) to 7.1 x 10(-5) (propiconazole). The integrated consideration of ecological risk and frequency of risk inform priorities for regional pesticide management and control. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Steel, JA; Duncan, A				Steel, JA; Duncan, A			Modelling the ecological aspects of bankside reservoirs and implications for management	HYDROBIOLOGIA					Conference on Hydrobiologia	MAR, 1996	UNIV LEICESTER, LEICESTER, ENGLAND		UNIV LEICESTER			Bankside storage reservoirs are used as a major water supply resource in the lower Thames Valley, England. They form the link between the River Thames and the water treatment works of the Greater London area. The reservoirs act as both a water reserve in times of low river flows, and a quality 'buffer' between the river and the treatment works. The load on the water treatment works (particulate material, physico-chemical characteristics) primarily reflects the water qualities of the reservoirs. Management of such reservoirs thus seeks to reduce the adverse impacts which would otherwise arise from direct river use, and to ensure as far as possible that the ecological processes within the reservoirs do not introduce new challenges to the water treatment. Reservoir management clearly needs a good understanding of those ecological processes and their interactions, and, hopefully, a means to exploit that understanding in hindcasting to explain past events, in forecasting near- or far-future events, and to help in exploring operational options to ameliorate any foreseable difficulties. The reservoirs consist of a variety of configurations, physical dimensions and operational circumstances. They have, importantly, basically simple morphologies, known hydraulic regimes and physico-chemical qualities. Nonetheless, they appear to behave essentially as small (1-50 Mm(3)), eutrophic lakes; and various aspects of their ecology has been studied for the past 65 years. Their attributes and operational involvement make them ideal candidates for ecological modelling, which has been applied to them in varying extents for the past 30 years. The major conclusion which may be drawn from these studies is that even in such relatively simple water bodies, current (and probably future) models can only encompass their broad ecological characteristics. Detailed operational needs have to be met by a variety of modelling approaches, mainly predicated on the basis of only being able to know a lot about a little or a little about a lot. The operational needs for modelling fall into the following broad types: (a) understanding: why did those events occur, or where is our ignorance greatest? (b) short-term forecasts: how will the current situation develop in the short-term (weeks)? (c) what-if considerations: what would happen if some management facility were employed or used differently? (d) optimisation: what are the optimal volume- quality supply arrangements? (e) long-term prediction: what is the longer-term (years) outlook under foreseeable scenarios? (f) projective evaluation: how would potential, as yet non-existant reservoirs behave under prescribed circumstances? Examples of how these needs have been met are outlined, with examples ranging from simple models of the diatom ecology of the reservoirs to much broader trophic-dynamic descriptions which can allow expression of fish-zooplankton-phytoplankton interactions. This is crucial for present and future management of cyanobacterial phases. It is clear that considerable management insight and control can result from modelling assistance, but only if the appropriate questions are asked. Whilst simple short-term modelling is less demanding, any attempt to model the full complexity of the ecology of even these relatively simple water-bodies is probably doomed to founder on complexity-understanding difficulties, unless these are resolved to much more constrained system aspects. This is particularly so for the qualitative biology. The best that may presently be foreseen is for development of the newer multi-biological type models, with reasonably realistic and dynamic physical and chemical environment sub-models, being able to manifest the general characteristics of the ecosystem in question. Despite such difficulties, new reservoir management insights and approaches will inevitably be founded on critical modelling of those ecosystems.																			0018-8158					FEB	1999	395						133	147		10.1023/A:1017041417145	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017041417145													WOS:000082727900014
J	Li, B; Yang, GS; Wan, RR				Li, Bing; Yang, Guishan; Wan, Rongrong			Multidecadal water quality deterioration in the largest freshwater lake in China (Poyang Lake): Implications on eutrophication management	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China and a globally important wetland with various functions. Exploring the multidecadal trend of water quality and hydroclimatic conditions is important for understanding the adaption of the lake system under the pressure from multiple anthropogenic and meteorological stressors. The present study applied the Mann-Kendall trend analysis and Pettitt test to detect the trend and breakpoints of hydroclimatic, and water quality parameters (from the 1980s to 2018) and the trend of monthly-seasonal ammonia (NH4-N) and total phosphorus (TP)concentrations (from 2002 to 2018) in Poyang Lake. Results showed that Poyang Lake had undergone a highly significant warming trend from 1980 to 2018, with a warming rate of 0.44 degrees C/decade in terms of annual daily mean air temperature. The wind speed and water level of the lake presented a highly significant decreasing trend, whereas no notable trend was detected for precipitation variations. The annual mean total nitrogen (TN), NH4-N, TP, and permanganate index (CODMn) concentrations showed significant upward trends from the 1980s to 2018. Remarkable abrupt shifts were detected for TN, NH4-N, and CODMn in around 2003. They were in accordance with the water level breakpoint of the lake, thus implying the important role of hydrological conditions in water quality variations in floodplain lakes. A significant increasing trend has been detected for Chl-a variations during wet season from 2008 to 2018, which could be attributed to the increasing trend of nutrient concentration during the nutrient-limited phase of Poyang Lake. These hydroclimatic and water quality trends suggest a high risk of increasing phytoplankton growth in Poyang Lake. This study thus emphasizes the need for adaptive lake eutrophication management for floodplain lakes, particularly the consideration of the strong trade-off and synergies between hydroclimatic conditions and water quality variations.

J	MONTANINI, A; BARBIERI, M; CASTORINA, F				MONTANINI, A; BARBIERI, M; CASTORINA, F			THE ROLE OF FRACTIONAL CRYSTALLIZATION, CRUSTAL MELTING AND MAGMA MIXING IN THE PETROGENESIS OF RHYOLITES AND MAFIC INCLUSION-BEARING DACITES FROM THE MONTE-ARCI VOLCANIC COMPLEX (SARDINIA, ITALY)	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Rhyolitic lavas and mafic inclusion-bearing dacites (MIBD) form the dominant products of the Monte Arci volcanic complex, one of the most active sites of volcanic activity in Sardinia during the Pliocene. The massif is composed of four distinct eruptive episodes (Phase 1: rhyolites; Phase 2: dacites and andesites; Phase 3: quartz-normative trachytes; Phase 4: mafic lavas ranging from subalkaline to mildly alkaline). Monte Arci magmatism has been characterized by open-system behaviour, with both mantle and crustal contributions and magma mixing. Although the mafic products are restricted to the latest stage of activity, mafic inclusions are quite common in many rhyolites and dacites. The mineral assemblages of the inclusions are dominated by plagioclase + orthopyroxene +/- augite, with minor olivine, Fe-Ti oxides and variable amounts of residual trapped liquid giving rise to a fine-grained groundmass. They represent blobs of magma entrained in a partly molten state and provide evidence of a basaltic contribution to the petrogenesis of their enclosing lavas, both as parental magmas or as a source of heat for partial melting of crustal rocks. Rhyolites are metaluminous to slightly peraluminous rocks with a wide range of SiO2 contents (67-75%). They fall into two groups: (1) Mafic inclusion-bearing rhyolites (MIBR). These have initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios between 0.70526 and 0.70897 and commonly show relatively high values of Ti, Mg, Fe, Ca, Sr and compatible trace elements (Ni, Cr, V); cordierite-bearing, highly restitic, crustal xenoliths are rare. (2) Inclusion-free rhyolites (IFR). They include both porphyritic lavas (IFR1) and obsidians (IFR2, IFR3), which share low values of Ti, Fe, Mg, Ca, Sr and are strongly depleted in compatible trace elements. IFR 1-2 have a marked LREE/HREE fractionation and a narrow range of Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.70885-0.70972), whereas IFR3 have larger Sr isotopic ratios (0.71529-0.71553), low Th, Zr, Hf. LREE contents and low LREE/HREE. Nd isotopic composition is quite uniform for all rhyolite types, with relatively low Nd-143/Nd-144 ratios (0.51216-0.51228, epsilon(Nd) ranging between -9.3 and -6.9). MIBR appear to be the product of fractionation of subalkaline (tholeiitic) magmas + assimilation of a crustal component moderately enriched in Sr-87 and/or with low Sr content. IFR 1-2 may be derived from partial melting of moderately Sr-87-rich crustal lithologies with retention of garnet and plagioclase (+/-K-feldspar) in the restite, although AFC processes (followed by effective separation from the basalts) cannot be excluded. Obsidians IFR3 need a crustal source with higher Sr-87/Sr-86; their peculiar geochemical features most probably reflect the complex behaviour during partial melting of accessory minerals carrying REE, Th, Zr, Hf. Among the eruptive products of Phase 2, mafic inclusion-bearing dacites (MIBD) provide evidence of basalt-rhyolite mixing: (a) coexistence of glasses with SiO2 content ranging from 64 to 72 wt.%; (b) a phenocryst assemblage including phases of basaltic and rhyolitic provenance; and (c) abundant crystal-rich inclusions related to a basaltic intrusion. The extrusion of these lavas has been preceeded by an explosive eruption of rhyolitic tuffs (Sr-87/Sr-86 initial ratio = 0.71097). The most satisfactory petrogenetic model for MIBD includes: (1) differentiation of subalkaline (tholeiitic) magma to a silica-poor and Ti-Fe-P rich liquid; (2) partial melting of wall-rocks yielding a rhyolitic magma segregated at the top of the basaltic reservoir; and (3) explosive eruption of the uppermost portion of the magma chamber followed by mixing of rhyolite with the underlying part of the system to form a hybrid dacite.					barbieri, mario/AAJ-1477-2021; Montanini, Alessandra/B-5599-2012	Francesca, Castorina/0000-0002-8342-7151; 													0377-0273	1872-6097				JUN	1994	61	1-2					95	120		10.1016/0377-0273(94)00002-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0377-0273(94)00002-6													WOS:A1994NW87200004

Tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and sulfadiazine are the four dominant antibiotics in this region, with maximum and median concentrations of 1454.8 and 304.8 ng/L, 2796.6 and 161.9 ng/L, 1431.3 and 349.9 ng/L, and 499.5 and 106.5 ng/L, respectively. The median concentrations of the other nine antibiotics are lower than 57.1 ng/L. The highest contaminated sites are located in the Four-lake main canal and its lake inlets. Antibiotic concentrations were higher in November than in May and the concentrations were strongly correlated with water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and nitrates according to redundancy analysis. The source analysis indicated that besides untreated domestic and husbandry sewage, the aquaculture in the lake and ponds is a main source of antibiotics in the study region. The environmental hazards posed by the selected antibiotics were assessed by using the methods of hazard quotient and mixture hazard quotient. The results suggested that tetracycline, oxytetracycline, sulfadiazine, and ciprofloxacin pose medium to high ecological hazard to algae in almost all of the water samples, and the high combination ecological hazards of antibiotics are mainly posed by the high individual hazard quotient of tetracycline in the study area.

G.; Shmelev, Denis; Ulrich, Mathias; Veremeeva, Alexandra			Deep Yedoma permafrost: A synthesis of depositional characteristics and carbon vulnerability	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Permafrost is a distinct feature of the terrestrial Arctic and is vulnerable to climate warming. Permafrost degrades in different ways, including deepening of a seasonally unfrozen surface and localized but rapid development of deep thaw features. Pleistocene ice-rich permafrost with syngenetic ice-wedges, termed Yedoma deposits, are widespread in Siberia, Alaska, and Yukon, Canada and may be especially prone to rapid-thaw processes. Freeze-locked organic matter in such deposits can be re-mobilized on short time-scales and contribute to a carbon-cycle climate feedback. Here we synthesize the characteristics and vulnerability of Yedoma deposits by synthesizing studies on the Yedoma origin and the associated organic carbon pool. We suggest that Yedoma deposits accumulated under periglacial weathering, transport, and deposition dynamics in non-glaciated regions during the late Pleistocene until the beginning of late glacial warming. The deposits formed due to a combination of aeolian, colluvial, nival, and alluvial deposition and simultaneous ground ice accumulation. We found up to 130 gigatons organic carbon in Yedoma, parts of which are well-preserved and available for fast decomposition after thaw. Based on incubation experiments, up to 10% of the Yedoma carbon is considered especially decomposable and may be released upon thaw. The substantial amount of ground ice in Yedoma makes it highly vulnerable to disturbances such as thermokarst and thermo-erosion processes. Mobilization of permafrost carbon is expected to increase under future climate warming. Our synthesis results underline the need of accounting for Yedoma carbon stocks in next generation Earth-System-Models for a more complete representation of the permafrost-carbon feedback.

J	Varol, M				Varol, Memet			Spatio-temporal changes in surface water quality and sediment phosphorus content of a large reservoir in Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												The Keban Dam Reservoir, located on the Euphrates River, is the second largest reservoir of Turkey. Water quality of this reservoir is of great importance because it is widely used for recreation, aquaculture production, fishing, and irrigation. In this study, discriminant analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), factor analysis (FA) and cluster analysis (CA) were conducted to evaluate the seasonal and spatial variations in surface water quality of the reservoir. Also, total phosphorus (TP) content in sediments, water type and trophic status of the reservoir were determined. For this, 19 water quality variables and TP in sediments were monitored seasonally at 11 sampling stations on the reservoir during one year. Hierarchical CA classified 11 stations into three groups, i.e., upstream (moderate polluted), midstream (low polluted) and downstream (clean) regions. PCA/FA allowed to group the variables responsible for variations in water quality, which are mainly related to mineral dissolution (natural), organic matter and nutrients (anthropogenic), and physical parameters (natural). Discriminant analysis (DA) gave better results for both data reduction and spatio-temporal analysis. Stepwise temporal DA identified eight variables: water temperature (WT), chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), potassium (K+), magnesium (Mg2+), and calcium (Ca2+), which are the most significant variables responsible for temporal variations in water quality of the reservoir, while stepwise spatial DA identified three variables: K+, chloride (Cl-), and sulphate (SO4-2), which are the most significant variables responsible for spatial variations. According to Ontario sediment-quality guidelines, sediments of the reservoir can be considered as unpolluted in terms of mean TP content. The water type of the reservoir was calcium-bicarbonate. According to trophic state index values based on TP and Chl-a, upstream region (moderate polluted) of the reservoir was in the eutrophic status, whereas other regions were in the mesotrophic status.

Attitudes Toward COVID-19 Illness and COVID-19 Vaccination among Pregnant Women: A Cross-Sectional Multicenter Study during August-December 2020	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY												Objective The aim of the study was to evaluate pregnant women's attitudes toward COVID-19 illness and vaccination and identify factors associated with vaccine acceptability. Study Design This was a cross-sectional survey among pregnant women enrolled in a prospective COVID-19 cohort study in Salt Lake City, UT, Birmingham, AL, and New York, NY, from August 9 to December 10, 2020. Women were eligible if they were 18 to 50 years old and <28 weeks of gestation. Upon enrollment, women completed surveys regarding concerns about COVID-19 illness and likelihood of getting COVID-19 vaccine if one were available during pregnancy. Vaccine acceptability was defined as a response of "very likely" or "somewhat likely" on a 4-point Likert scale. Factors associated with vaccine acceptability were assessed with multivariable logistic regression. Results Of 939 pregnant women eligible for the main cohort study, 915 (97%) consented to participate. Among these 915 women, 39% self-identified as White, 23% Black, 33% Hispanic, and 4% Other. Sixty-two percent received an influenza vaccine last season. Seventy-two percent worried about getting sick with COVID-19. If they were to get sick, 92% worried about harm to their pregnancy and 80% about harm to themselves. Only 41% reported they would get a vaccine. Of women who were unlikely to get vaccinated, the most frequently cited concern was vaccine safety for their pregnancy (82%). Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women had lower odds of accepting a vaccine compared with non-Hispanic White women (adjusted odds ratios [aOR] 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.6 for both). Receipt of influenza vaccine during the previous season was associated with higher odds of vaccine acceptability (aOR 2.1, 95% CI 1.5-3.0). Conclusion Although most pregnant women worried about COVID-19 illness, <50% were willing to get vaccinated during pregnancy. Racial and ethnic disparities in plans to accept COVID-19 vaccine highlight the need to prioritize strategies to address perceived barriers among groups at high risk for COVID-19.					; Varner, Michael/K-9890-2013; Stockwell, Melissa/AAS-5914-2021; Razzaghi, Hilda/AFQ-9027-2022	Battarbee, Ashley/0000-0002-4837-8059; Varner, Michael/0000-0001-9455-3973; Galang, Romeo/0000-0001-9837-0699; 													0735-1631	1098-8785				JAN	2022	39	01					75	83		10.1055/s-0041-1735878	http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1735878		OCT 2021						34598291					WOS:000702513700001

However, it was not until the end of the 20th century that researchers had started to pay attention to the hazards and causes of HABs. In this study, we analyzed 5720 published literatures on HABs studies in the past 30 years. Our review presents the emerging trends in the past 30 years on HABs studies, the environmental and human health risks, prevention and control strategies and future developments.

Isotopes (delta N-15, delta O-18) help unravel spatiotemporal nitrogen(N)-cycling of aquatic nitrate (NO3-). We synthesized nitrate isotope data (n=similar to 5200) for global rivers and shallow aquifers for common patterns and processes. Rivers had lower median NO3- (0.30.2mgL(-1), n=2902) compared to aquifers (5.5 +/- 5.1mgL(-1), n=2291) and slightly lower delta N-15 values (+7.1 +/- 3.8 parts per thousand, n=2902 vs +7.7 +/- 4.5 parts per thousand, n=2291), but were indistinguishable in delta O-18 (+2.3 +/- 6.2 parts per thousand, n=2790 vs +2.3 +/- 5.4 parts per thousand, n=2235). The isotope composition of NO3- was correlated with water temperature revealing enhanced N-cascading in warmer climates. Seasonal analyses revealed higher delta N-15 and delta O-18 values in wintertime, suggesting waste-related N-source signals are better preserved in the cold seasons. Isotopic assays of nitrate biogeochemical transformations are key to understanding nitrate pollution and to inform beneficial agricultural and land management strategies.					; Fadhullah, Widad/GLS-7018-2022; Gooddy, Daren/A-7442-2013; Sacchi, Elisa/F-1293-2014; Re, Viviana/O-1540-2019; Monteiro, Lucilena/AAN-9557-2020; Li, Siliang/AFB-7205-2022; Biasi, Christina/E-1130-2013; Welti, Nina/S-2121-2016; Matiatos, Ioannis/GYA-5688-2022; Boeckx, Pascal/J-3668-2013; Kazakis, Nerantzis/Q-5205-2016; Yue, Fu-Jun/K-7305-2017; Trinh, Duc/ABF-7253-2021	Matiatos, Ioannis/0000-0002-0395-2678; Gooddy, Daren/0000-0002-6015-1332; Venkiteswaran, Jason J./0000-0002-6574-7071; Sacchi, Elisa/0000-0003-2144-2927; Monteiro, Lucilena Rebelo/0000-0002-4457-4925; Romanelli, Asuncion/0000-0002-9003-396X; Trinh, Duc/0000-0003-4207-8845; Garcia-Moya, Alejandro/0000-0002-5704-6355; Bouchaou, Lhoussaine/0000-0003-4909-5023; Welti, Nina/0000-0001-9966-5915; Yue, Fu-Jun/0000-0003-3733-7216; Boeckx, Pascal/0000-0003-3998-0010; Kazakis, Nerantzis/0000-0002-0406-9561; Tamooh, Fredrick/0000-0001-6240-018X														2662-4435				MAR 1	2021	2	1							52	10.1038/s43247-021-00121-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s43247-021-00121-x													WOS:000665761900001
J	Wik, M; Varner, RK; Anthony, KW; MacIntyre, S; Bastviken, D				Wik, Martin; Varner, Ruth K.; Anthony, Katey Walter; MacIntyre, Sally; Bastviken, David			Climate-sensitive northern lakes and ponds are critical components of methane release	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												Lakes and ponds represent one of the largest natural sources of the greenhouse gas methane. By surface area, almost half of these waters are located in the boreal region and northwards. A synthesis of measurements of methane emissions from 733 lakes and ponds north of similar to 50 degrees N, combined with new inventories of inland waters, reveals that emissions from these high latitudes amount to around 16.5 Tg CH4 yr(-1) (12.4 Tg CH4-C yr(-1)). This estimate - from lakes and ponds alone - is equivalent to roughly two-thirds of the inverse model calculation of all natural methane sources in the region. Thermokarst water bodies have received attention for their high emission rates, but we find that post-glacial lakes are a larger regional source due to their larger areal extent. Water body depth, sediment type and ecoclimatic region are also important in explaining variation in methane fluxes. Depending on whether warming and permafrost thaw cause expansion or contraction of lake and pond areal coverage, we estimate that annual water body emissions will increase by 20-54% before the end of the century if ice-free seasons are extended by 20 days. We conclude that lakes and ponds are a dominant methane source at high northern latitudes.

J	Kajan, K; Osterholz, H; Stegen, J; Udovic, MG; Orlic, S				Kajan, Katarina; Osterholz, Helena; Stegen, James; Udovic, Marija Gligora; Orlic, Sandi			Mechanisms shaping dissolved organic matter and microbial community in lake ecosystems	WATER RESEARCH												Lakes are active components of the global carbon cycle and host a range of processes that degrade and modify dissolved organic matter (DOM). Through the degradation of DOM molecules and the synthesis of new compounds, microbes in aquatic environments strongly and continuously influence chemodiversity, which can feedback to influence microbial diversity. Developing a better understanding of the biodiversity patterns that emerge along spatial and environmental gradients is one of the key objectives of community ecology. A changing climate may affect ecological feedback, including those that affect microbial communities. To maintain the function of a lake ecosystem and predict carbon cycling in the environment, it is increasingly important to understand the coupling between microbial and DOM diversity. To unravel the biotic and abiotic mechanisms that control the structure and patterns of DOM and microbial communities in lakes, we combined highthroughput sequencing and ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry together with a null modeling approach. The advantage of null models is their ability to evaluate the relative influences of stochastic and deterministic assembly processes in both DOM and microbial community assemblages. The present study includes spatiotemporal signatures of DOM and the microbial community in six temperate lakes contrasting continental and Mediterranean climates during the productive season. Different environmental conditions and nutrient sources characterized the studied lakes. Our results have shown high covariance between molecular-level DOM diversity and the diversity of individual microbial communities especially with diversity of microeukaryotes and freeliving bacteria indicating their dynamic feedback. We found that the differences between lakes and climatic regions were mainly reflected in the diversity of DOM at the molecular formula-level and the microeukaryota community. Furthermore, using null models the DOM assembly was governed by deterministic variable selection operating consistently and strongly within and among lakes. In contrast, microbial community assembly processes were highly variable across lakes with different trophic status and climatic regions. Difference in the processes governing DOM and microbial composition does not indicate weak coupling between these components, rather it suggests that distinct factors may be influencing microbial communities and DOM assemblages separately. Further understanding of the DOM-microbe coupling (or lack thereof) is key to formulating predictive models of future lake ecology and function.					; Udovič, Marija/IZE-0991-2023; Kajan, Katarina/IAQ-0470-2023; Stegen, James/Q-3078-2016; Orlic, Sandi/AAE-6082-2019	Kajan, Katarina/0000-0002-9266-7245; Orlic, Sandi/0000-0002-6339-4145; Stegen, James/0000-0001-9135-7424; Gligora Udovic, Marija/0000-0002-1982-2528													0043-1354	1879-2448				OCT 15	2023	245								120653	10.1016/j.watres.2023.120653	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2023.120653		SEP 2023						37742402					WOS:001083555100001
J	Van Loon, AF; Laaha, G				Van Loon, A. F.; Laaha, G.			Hydrological drought severity explained by climate and catchment characteristics	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Impacts of a drought are generally dependent on the severity of the hydrological drought event, which can be expressed by streamflow drought duration or deficit volume. For prediction and the selection of drought sensitive regions, it is crucial to know how streamflow drought severity relates to climate and catchment characteristics. In this study we investigated controls on drought severity based on a comprehensive Austrian dataset consisting of 44 catchments with long time series of hydrometeorological data (on average around 50 year) and information on a large number of physiographic catchment characteristics. Drought analysis was performed with the variable threshold level method and various statistical tools were applied, i.e. bivariate correlation analysis, heatmaps, linear models based on multiple regression, varying slope models, and automatic stepwise regression. Results indicate that streamflow drought duration is primarily controlled by storage, quantified by the Base Flow Index or by a combination of catchment characteristics related to catchment storage and release, e.g. geology and land use. Additionally, the duration of dry spells in precipitation is important for strearnflow drought duration. Hydrological drought deficit, however, is governed by average catchment wetness (represented by mean annual precipitation) and elevation (reflecting seasonal storage in the snow pack and glaciers). Our conclusion is that both drought duration and deficit are governed by a combination of climate and catchment control, but not in a similar way. Besides meteorological forcing, storage is important; storage in soils, aquifers, lakes, etc. influences drought duration and seasonal storage in snow and glaciers influences drought deficit. Consequently, the spatial variation of hydrological drought severity is highly dependent on terrestrial hydrological processes. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Initial Geostationary Lightning Mapper Observations	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) continuously observes lightning throughout a near hemispheric field of view, capturing spatiotemporal variability on unprecedented scales. This study documents GLM lightning distributions during the initial 9 months in the operational Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-East position (December 2017 to August 2018). Spatial maps, summary statistics, and time series illustrate seasonal, regional, and diurnal lightning patterns. Lightning activity shifts from south to north during the study period with most lightning over land (83%). The average GLM flash extends over a 454-km(2) area, lasts 301 ms, produces 262 fJ of optical energy, and consists of 16.4 (42.2) groups (events). On average, GLM flashes over the oceans are larger (570 km(2) ), of longer duration (345 ms), and brighter (420 fJ) than flashes over land (431 km(2) , 293 ms, and 230 fJ). The baseline values and early insights reported herein aim to guide the early development and application of GLM observations. Plain Language Summary The Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) is the first sensor of its kind, and this technological advancement now allows continuous operational monitoring of total lightning on time and space scales never before available. The GLM has entered into a golden age of lightning observations, which will spur more rapid progress toward synthesis of lightning observations with other meteorological data sets and forecasting tools. This study documents the first 9 months of GLM operations to introduce this new lightning data source and demonstrate the value of this new technology. Within the first 9 months, the GLM captured similar spatial patterns of lightning occurrence to many previous studies covering much longer periods of time. The present study shows that GLM flashes were less common over the oceans, but that the oceanic flashes were larger, brighter, and lasted longer than flashes over land. The ability to continuously sample lightning distributions throughout the GLM field of view allows detailed analysis of the diurnal cycle (e.g., Lake Maracaibo). The GLM presents exciting new possibilities, with countless new applications anticipated over the coming decades.					; Rudlosky, Scott/H-4309-2011	Virts, Katrina/0000-0002-8616-9557; Bruning, Eric/0000-0003-1959-442X; goodman, steven/0000-0003-1091-030X; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				JAN 28	2019	46	2					1097	1104		10.1029/2018GL081052	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018GL081052													WOS:000458607400063

Key climatic variables affecting water bodies, including air temperature (AT), actual evapotranspiration (ETa), and total precipitation, were analyzed from 2000 to 2021 using the temperature-vegetation index (TVX) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. The findings demonstrate a clear association between global warming and the shrinking of surface water resources in the LUB. According to the results, an increase in AT corresponded to a decrease in water surface area, highlighting the significant influence of AT and ETa on controlling the water surface in the LUB (partial rho of - 0.65 and - 0.68, respectively). Conversely, no significant relationship was found with precipitation and water surface area (partial rho of + 0.25). Notably, the results of the study indicate that over the past four decades, approximately 40% of the water bodies in the LUB remained permanent. This suggests a loss of around 30% of the permanent water resources, which have transitioned into seasonal water bodies, accounting for nearly 13% of the total. This research provides a comprehensive framework for monitoring surface water resource variations and assessing the impact of climate change on water resources. It aids in the development of sustainable water management strategies and plans, supporting the preservation and effective use of water resources.					; Sadeqi, Amin/ABD-9179-2021; Kariminejad, Narges/HGT-8082-2022; Ahmadi, Reyhaneh/NBX-4651-2025; Kazemi Garajeh, Mohammad/KOD-4408-2024	Kazemi Garajeh, Mohammad/0000-0002-7195-2813; Sadeqi, Amin/0000-0001-7717-9086; 													2045-2322					MAR 5	2024	14	1							5469	10.1038/s41598-024-56160-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-56160-9								38443699					WOS:001180457200021

A Review of the Integrated Effects of Changing Climate, Land Use, and Dams on Mekong River Hydrology	WATER												The ongoing and proposed construction of large-scale hydropower dams in the Mekong river basin is a subject of intense debate and growing international concern due to the unprecedented and potentially irreversible impacts these dams are likely to have on the hydrological, agricultural, and ecological systems across the basin. Studies have shown that some of the dams built in the tributaries and the main stem of the upper Mekong have already caused basin-wide impacts by altering the magnitude and seasonality of flows, blocking sediment transport, affecting fisheries and livelihoods of downstream inhabitants, and changing the flood pulse to the Tonle Sap Lake. There are hundreds of additional dams planned for the near future that would result in further changes, potentially causing permanent damage to the highly productive agricultural systems and fisheries, as well as the riverine and floodplain ecosystems. Several studies have examined the potential impacts of existing and planned dams but the integrated effects of the dams when combined with the adverse hydrologic consequences of climate change remain largely unknown. Here, we provide a detailed review of the existing literature on the changes in climate, land use, and dam construction and the resulting impacts on hydrological, agricultural, and ecological systems across the Mekong. The review provides a basis to better understand the effects of climate change and accelerating human water management activities on the coupled hydrological-agricultural-ecological systems, and identifies existing challenges to study the region'sWater, Energy, and Food (WEF) nexus with emphasis on the influence of future dams and projected climate change. In the last section, we synthesize the results and highlight the urgent need to develop integrated models to holistically study the coupled natural-human systems across the basin that account for the impacts of climate change and water infrastructure development. This review provides a framework for future research in the Mekong, including studies that integrate hydrological, agricultural, and ecological modeling systems.

J	Feng, L; Hou, XJ; Zheng, Y				Feng, Lian; Hou, Xuejiao; Zheng, Yi			Monitoring and understanding the water transparency changes of fifty large lakes on the Yangtze Plain based on long-term MODIS observations	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Various aspects of the water qualities of the large lakes in the Yangtze Plain (YP) have been studied, while the efforts have been spent on one of the most important parameters-water transparency were only limited to several large lakes. Using in situ remote sensing reflectance and Secchi-disk depth (Z(sd)) datasets, we assessed the performance of a semi-analytical model recently proposed by Lee et al. (2015) for remote sensing of the Z(sd) (Z(sd), (Lee)). The results show that a linear scaling correction over Z(sd), (Lee) (Z(sd)', (Lee)) could lead to improved agreement between remote sensing estimates and field measurements (root mean square error < 35%) in the study region. The Z(sd)'(,) (Lee) scheme was then applied to MODIS/Aqua observations between 2003 and 2016 to obtain the spatial and temporal dynamics of water transparency in 50 large lakes in the YP. The long-term mean Z(sd) of the entire region was 0.39 +/- 1.17 m during the observation period, with high and low values occurring in warm and cold seasons, respectively. Of the 50 examined lakes, half demonstrated decreasing or increasing Z(sd) trends, and the number of lakes exhibiting significantly decreasing trends also comparable to the number exhibiting increasing trends. The relative contributions of the seven potential driving factors (from both human activities and natural processes) to the interannual changes in water clarity were quantified for each lake using a multiple general linear model regression analysis. The responses of Z(sd) to these drivers showed considerable differences among lakes, and human activities demonstrated significant roles in more lakes than those affected by natural variability, accounting for 50% (25/50) and 20% (10/50) of the lakes, respectively. This study provides the first comprehensive basin-scale estimate of the water transparency in the lakes in the YP, and the Z(sd) results and analysis of driving forces can provide important information for local water quality conservation and restoration.					; Hou, Xuejiao/IYT-1780-2023; Zheng, Yi/B-1333-2012; Feng, Lian/JQI-0512-2023	Feng, Lian/0000-0002-4590-3022; Zheng, Yi/0000-0001-8442-182X; 													0034-4257	1879-0704				FEB	2019	221						675	686		10.1016/j.rse.2018.12.007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2018.12.007													WOS:000456640700050

Although brGDGTs are globally ubiquitous, the microbial producers of these membrane lipids remain unknown, precluding a full understanding of the ways in which environmental parameters control their production and distribution. Here, we advance this understanding in three ways. First, we present 43 new high-latitude lake sites characterized by low mean annual air temperatures (MATs) and high seasonality, filling an important gap in the global dataset. Second, we introduce a new approach for analyzing brGDGT data in which compound fractional abundances (FAs) are calculated within structural groups based on methylation number, methylation position, and cyclization number. Finally, we perform linear and nonlinear regressions of the resulting FAs against a suite of environmental parameters in a compiled global lake sediment dataset (n = 182). We find that our approach deconvolves temperature, conductivity, and pH trends in brGDGTs without increasing calibration errors from the standard approach. We also find that it reveals novel patterns in brGDGT distributions and provides a methodology for investigating the biological underpinnings of their structural diversity. Warmseason temperature indices outperformed MAT in our regressions, with the mean temperature of months above freezing yielding the highest-performing model (adjusted R-2 = 0.91, RMSE = 1.97 degrees C, n = 182). The natural logarithm of conductivity had the second-strongest relationship to brGDGT distributions (adjusted R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.66, n = 143), notably outperforming pH in our dataset (adjusted R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 0.57, n = 154) and providing a potential new proxy for paleohydrology applications. We recommend these calibrations for use in lake sediments globally, including at high latitudes, and detail the advantages and disadvantages of each.

J	CHOWFRASER, P; SPRULES, WG				CHOWFRASER, P; SPRULES, WG			TYPE-3 FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSE IN LIMNETIC SUSPENSION-FEEDERS, AS DEMONSTRATED BY INSITU GRAZING RATES	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Field-measured grazing rates (ml/animal/d) of cladocerans (mostly daphniids) and diaptomids were assembled from various published studies and plotted as a function of corresponding phytoplankton concentration (mu-g l-1 fw.). Filtering rates of both zooplankton groups initially increased with seston concentration until maximal grazing rates were observed at approximately 4 x 10(2) and 1 x 10(2) mu-g l-1 for cladocerans and copepods, respectively; at higher algal concentrations, filtering rates of both declined as a function of food concentration. The shape of these curves are most consistent with Holling's (1966) Type 3 functional response. We found little support for the Type 3 functional response in published laboratory studies of Daphnia; most investigators report either a Type 1 or Type 2 response. The one study in which the Type 3 response was observed involved experiments where animals were acclimated at low food concentrations for 24 h, whereas those studies associated with response Types 1 or 2 had acclimation periods of only 1 to 3 h. We therefore assembled relevant data from the literature to examine the effect of acclimation period on the feeding rates of Daphnia at low food concentrations. In the absence of any acclimation, animals filtered at extremely low rates. After 2 h of acclimation, however, filtering rates increased 4 to 5-fold but declined again with longer durations; after > 70 h of pre-conditioning, filtering rates were almost as low as they had been with no acclimation. We also found little support for the Type 3 functional response in published studies of copepods. The only study associated with a Type 3 response involved a marine copepod that had been subjected to a starvation period of 48 h; however, an analysis of the effects of acclimation period did not yield conclusive evidence that filtering rates of freshwater copepods (Diaptomus and Eudiaptomus) decrease significantly with acclimation duration. The low filtering rates associated with long acclimation periods in laboratory experiments appears to be a direct result of animals becoming emaciated from prolonged exposure to low food concentrations, a situation which renders them incapable of high filtering rates. This may explain the Type 3 functional response for field cladocerans, since zooplankton in food-limiting situations are constantly exposed to low food concentrations, and would therefore have low body carbon and consequently less energy to filter-feed. We cannot, however, use this to explain the Type 3 response for field diaptomids, since copepods in the laboratory did not appear to lose body carbon even after 72 h of feeding at very low food levels, and there was inconclusive evidence that either Diaptomus or Eudiaptomus decrease their filtering rates with acclimation period. Although Incipient Limiting Concentrations (ILC) for Daphnia ranged from 1 to 8.5 x 10(3) mu-g l-1 more than half of these fell between 1 and 3 x 10(3) mu-g l-1, bracketing the value of 2.7 x 10(2) mu-g l-1 for field cladocerans. There was, however, a great deal of variation in reported maximum ingestion rates (MIR), maximum filtering rates (MFR) and ILC values for Daphnia magna. ILC values from the few laboratory studies of freshwater copepods ranged between 0.5 to 2.8 x 10(3) mu-g l-1, and was higher than the ILC value of approximately 0.2 x 10(3) mu-g l-1 calculated for field populations of D. minutus. Generally, there was considerable agreement among laboratory studies regarding the shape of grazing-rate and ingestion-rate curves when data were converted to similar units and presented on standardized scales.																			0018-8158					APR 24	1992	232	3					175	191		10.1007/BF00013703	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00013703													WOS:A1992JA10200001

Internal phosphorus loading in Canadian fresh waters: a critical review and data analysis	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Many physical, chemical, and biological processes in freshwater ecosystems mobilize the nutrient phosphorus (P) from sediments, which in turn may contribute to the formation of harmful algal blooms. Here, we critically reviewed internal P loading in Canadian fresh waters to understand the geographic patterns and environmental drivers of this important process. From 43 publications, we consolidated 618 estimates of internal P loading from Canadian freshwater ponds, lakes, reservoirs, and coastal wetlands (n = 70). Expressed in terms of total P, short-term gross rates in sediment samples (L-gross) ranged from -27 to 54 mg.m(-2).day(-1) (n = 461), while long-term net rates in whole ecosystems (L-net) ranged from -1694 to 10 640 mg.m(-2).year(-1) (n = 157). The main environmental drivers of this variation were oxygen, pH, geology, and trophic state. Internal P loading tended to be higher during the open-water season and most prominent in small prairie lakes. Priorities for future research on internal P loading should include resolving methodological problems, assessing the relative importance of different mechanisms, examining the influence of anthropogenic activities, and quantifying rates in understudied ecosystems.

Knowing the variation pattern of pCO(2) is important for obtaining accurate global estimation. Here we examine seasonal and trophic variations in lake pCO(2) based on 13 field campaigns conducted in Chinese lakes from 2017 to 2021. We found significant seasonal fluctuations in pCO(2), with decreasing values as trophic states intensify within the same region. Saline lakes exhibit lower pCO(2) levels than freshwater lakes. These pCO(2) dynamics result in variable areal CO2 emissions, with lakes exhibiting different trophic states (oligotrophication > mesotrophication > eutrophication) and saline lakes differing from freshwater lakes (-23.1 +/- 17.4 vs. 19.3 +/- 18.3 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). These spatiotemporal pCO(2) variations complicate total CO2 emission estimations. Using area proportions of lakes with varying trophic states and salinity in China, we estimate China's lake CO2 flux at 8.07 Tg C yr(-1). In future studies, the importance of accounting for lake salinity, seasonal dynamics, and trophic states must be noticed to enhance the accuracy of large-scale carbon emission estimates from lake ecosystems in the context of climate change.<br />(c) 2023 The Authors.

Understanding the intensity and contribution of internal nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loading in deep-water ecosystems is of great significance for water body eutrophication management. In this study, we combined intact sediment core incubation, high-resolution peeper (HR-Peeper) sampling, and analysis of N and P forms and other environmental factors in the water column and sediments to evaluate the contributions of internal N and P loading to water eutrophication by N and P fluxes across the sediment-water interface (SWI) of the Panjiakou Reservoir (PJKR), a deep-water ecosystem where eutrophication threatens the security of the local drinking water supply in North China. The results indicated that the PJKR showed obvious thermal and dissolved oxygen (DO) stratification in the warm seasons and full mixing in the cold seasons. The mean DO concentration was 9.9 and 3.55 mg/L in the epilimnion and hypolimnion, respectively, in warm seasons and 10.7 mg/L in cold seasons. The sediment acted as a source of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), NH4+-N, and NO2--N and a sink of NO3--N. The SRP fluxes were 5.28 +/- 4.34 and 2.30 +/- 1.93 mg m(-)(2).d(-1) in warm and cold seasons, respectively, and the dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) fluxes were -0.66 +/- 47.84 and 44.04 +/- 84.05 mg m(-2).d(-1). Seasonal hypoxia accelerated the release of P rather than N from the sediments in warm seasons, which came mainly from Fe-P and Org-P under anoxic conditions. The strong negative NO3--N flux (diffusion from the water column to the sediment) implied an intensive denitrification process at the SWI, which can counteract the release flux of NH4+-N and NO2--N, resulting in the sediment acting as a weak dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) source for the overlying water. We also found that internal N loading accounted for only similar to 9% of the total N loading, while internal P loading accounted for 43% of the total P loading of the reservoir. Our results highlight that efforts to manage the internal loading of deep-water ecosystems should focus on P and seasonal hypoxia.					zhang, min/IYI-9869-2023; Sun, Chuanzhe/LWH-6780-2024	Sun, Chuanzhe/0000-0003-4405-6391													0301-4797	1095-8630				OCT 1	2022	319								115681	10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115681	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115681		JUL 2022						35816961					WOS:000829234700001

High carbon emissions from thermokarst lakes of Western Siberia	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												The Western Siberia Lowland (WSL), the world's largest permafrost peatland, is of importance for understanding the high-latitude carbon (C) cycle and its response to climate change. Warming temperatures increase permafrost thaw and production of greenhouse gases. Also, permafrost thaw leads to the formation of lakes which are hotspots for atmospheric C emissions. Although lakes occupy similar to 6% of WSL, lake C emissions from WSL remain poorly quantified. Here we show high C emissions from lakes across all permafrost zones of WSL. The C emissions were especially high in shoulder seasons and in colder permafrost-rich regions. The total C emission from permafrost-affected lakes of WSL equals similar to 12 +/- 2.6 Tg C yr(-1) and is 2-times greater than region's C export to the Arctic coast. The results show that C emission from WSL lakes is a significant component in the high-latitude C cycle, but also suggest that C emission may decrease with warming.

A critical review of operational strategies for the management of harmful algal blooms (HABs) in inland reservoirs	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Occurrences of freshwater harmful algal blooms (HABs) are increasing on a global scale, largely in part due to increased nutrient input and changing climate patterns. While reservoir management strategies that can influ-ence phytoplankton are known, there is no published guideline or protocol for the management of harmful algal blooms. There is a need to establish what factors are the predominant drivers of blooms, and how common reservoir management strategies specifically influence each factor. The following literature review seeks to establish the benefits and drawbacks of operational management strategies that currently exist. The main focus is altering hydrodynamic conditions (hypolimnetic withdrawals, surface flushing, pulsed inflow, artificial mixing), in order to induce environmental changes within the reservoir itself. Since excess nutrients are one of the biggest contributors to worsening bloom conditions, internal nutrient dynamics and reduction are also discussed. Additionally, we review the predominant seasonal factors (stratification, light, temperature, and wind) that affect likelihood of bloom occurrence and duration. The ultimate objective of this review is to increase under-standing of the relationships between HAB drivers and reservoir operations in order to inform the development of data, modeling, and management strategies for the prevention and mitigation of blooms.

B	Sharma, CM; Borgstrom, R; Rosseland, BO		Ansari, AA; Gill, SS; Lanza, GR; Rast, W		Sharma, Chhatra Mani; Borgstrom, Reidar; Rosseland, Bjorn Olav			Biomanipulation in Lake Arungen, Norway: A Tool for Biological Control	EUTROPHICATION: CAUSES, CONSEQUENCES AND CONTROL												This chapter deals with whole-lake experimentation for the restoration of the water quality and reduction of pollutants in fish from the eutrophic Lake Arungen, Norway, through biomanipulation of the top predator fish, the northern pike (Esox lucius). The manipulation was carried out during 2004-2006, with a main effort to remove large cannibal pike (>65 cm), and the cascading impacts on the major fish community were evaluated. The main fish species in Lake Arungen are roach (Rutilus rutilus), perch (Perca fluviatilis), pike, and rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmas) with some additional fish species in low numbers. The main assumptions behind the removal of large pike were to obtain (i) increased number of small pike and large perch due to reduced cannibalism and predation pressure; (ii) reduced abundance of roach and small perch due to increased number of piscivores, i.e., small pike and large perch, and (iii) reduced levels of pollutants in the remaining fish community by increased growth rates and changes in diet. The recruitment success of pike after removal of large pike was evaluated by the Petersen mark-recapture method. The habitat utilization of the major fish species was studied based on gillnet catch data. The trophic position of different fish species was determined based on both gut content analyses and analyses of stable isotopes of nitrogen (N-15/N-14=delta N-15) and carbon (C-13/C-12=delta C-13). Important biological factors influencing the dynamics of mercury and organic pollutants through the fish community in the lake were identified as well. The estimated numbers of small pike (45-64.9 cm, mostly age class 3+) significantly increased in 2005-2006, after the experimental removal of the large pike in 2004 and 2005, and thus assumed to be a cannibal-driven response. The dominant prey fish of pike was roach, both in terms of numbers and biomass. The relative abundance of piscivores increased and as a consequence the relative abundance of small roach declined in 2005-2006. A marked shift in habitat utilization of roach and perch was recorded after the manipulation of the pike population. The gut content analysis was in agreement with the food web analysis based on the stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon in 2005-2006. Pike (exclusively piscivores) and perch (feeding mainly on zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, and fish) occupied the top trophic positions in Lake Arungen, with pike at the highest position. Roach and rudd occupied lower trophic positions, with rudd at the lowest. Although there was segregation in diet between roach and perch, the increased importance of zooplankton in their diet during the summer 2006 may indicate an increased abundance of zooplankton. Mercury content in fish muscle increased with size and weight (bioaccumulation), as well as with an increased position in the food web (biomagnification), with pike having the highest concentrations. Growth rate of pike in age classes 1-3 increased in 2005, probably due to the lower predation risk, and thereby a more extensive use of the most favorable pike habitats. The faster growth rate might have played a role for a significant decrease in total mercury concentrations, probably as a result of growth biodilution (similar to 50% reduction between same size groups of pike). None of the fish analyzed in 2005 had a mercury concentration which would have exceeded the FAO/WHO provisional tolerable weekly intake value (1.6 mu g kg(-1)), whereas the mercury concentration in only four					Sharma, Chhatra/A-6168-2009	Sharma, Chhatra/0000-0003-0714-7411															978-90-481-9624-1				2011							295	323		10.1007/978-90-481-9625-8_15	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-9625-8_15	10.1007/978-90-481-9625-8												WOS:000283620400015
J	Tanvir, RU; Hu, ZQ; Zhang, YY; Lu, JR				Tanvir, Rahamat Ullah; Hu, Zhiqiang; Zhang, Yanyan; Lu, Jingrang			Cyanobacterial community succession and associated cyanotoxin production in hypereutrophic and eutrophic freshwaters	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) in freshwater bodies are mainly attributed to excess loading of nutrients [nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)]. This study provides a comprehensive review of how the existing nutrient (i.e., N and P) conditions and microbial ecological factors affect cyanobacterial community succession and cyanotoxin production in freshwaters. Different eutrophic scenarios (i.e., hypereutrophic vs. eutrophic conditions) in the presence of (i) high levels of N and P, (ii) a relatively high level of P but a low level of N, and (iii) a relatively high level of N but a low level of P, are discussed in association with cyanobacterial community succession and cyanotoxin production. The seasonal cyanobacterial community succession is mostly regulated by temperature in hypereutrophic freshwaters, where both temperature and nitrogen fixation play a critical role in eutrophic freshwaters. While the early cyanoHAB mitigation strategies focus on reducing P from water bodies, many more studies show that both N and P have a profound contribution to cyanobacterial blooms and toxin production. The availability of N often shapes the structure of the cyanobacterial community (e.g., the relative abundance of N-2-fixing and non-N-2-fixing cyanobacterial genera) and is positively linked to the levels of microcystin. Ecological aspects of cyanotoxin production and release, related functional genes, and corresponding nutrient and environmental conditions are also elucidated. Research perspectives on cyanoHABs and cyanobacterial community succession are discussed and presented with respect to the following: (i) role of internal nutrients and their species, (ii) P- and N-based control vs. solely P-based control of cyanoHABs, and (iii) molecular investigations and prediction of cyanotoxin production.					; Zhang, Yanyan/AFQ-8403-2022	Tanvir, Rahamat Ullah/0000-0001-7369-5833; Lu, Jingrang/0000-0002-5785-3587; Hu, Zhiqiang/0000-0002-6408-6646; 													0269-7491	1873-6424				DEC 1	2021	290								118056	10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118056	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118056		SEP 2021						34488165					WOS:000696790800009

In this study, we identified the contributions of climate variables (including precipitation, radiation, temperature, and relative humidity), human-disturbed vegetation, and natural vegetation to the trends in annual ET and water yield over vegetated mainland China during 2001-2020, using a process-based terrestrial ecosystem model and a joint -solution method with multiple sensitivity numerical experiments. Results showed that 46% of the study area experienced significant (p < 0.05) increases in ET, with an overall increase of 2.32 mm y-1. Meanwhile, the overall trend in water yield was 2.56 mm y-1 but insignificant. Spatially, vegetation and precipitation are the dominant factors for ET trends over 55% and 32% of vegetated mainland China, respectively. Over the regions where vegetation dominates the ET trends, nearly half of these regions are covered by human-disturbed vege-tation (e.g., cropland or regions with land cover changes), suggesting that anthropogenic activities play a crucial role in the hydrological cycle there. Concerning the trends in water yield, precipitation is the dominant factor over 64% areas. Human-disturbed vegetation and natural vegetation play similar roles and combined can explain the water yield trends over 30% areas. Our study highlights the spatial variations in the mechanisms behind changes in the water budget over mainland China, particularly in regions covered by human-disturbed vegeta-tion. This finding should be considered in the existing and future national ecological recovery policies to maximize its eco-hydrological benefits.

J	Li, CH; Zhou, LZ; Xu, WB				Li, Chunhua; Zhou, Lizhi; Xu, Wenbin			Estimating Aboveground Biomass Using Sentinel-2 MSI Data and Ensemble Algorithms for Grassland in the Shengjin Lake Wetland, China	REMOTE SENSING												Wetland vegetation aboveground biomass (AGB) directly indicates wetland ecosystem health and is critical for water purification, carbon cycle, and biodiversity conservation. Accurate AGB estimation is essential for the monitoring and supervision of ecosystems, especially in seasonal floodplain wetlands. This paper explored the capability of spectral and texture features from the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) for modeling grassland AGB using random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithms in Shengjin Lake wetland (a Ramsar site). We use five-fold cross-validation to verify the model effectiveness. The results indicated that the RF and XGBoost models had a robust and efficient performance (with root mean square error (RMSE) of 126.571 g center dot m(-2) and R-2 of 0.844 for RF, RMSE of 112.425 g center dot m(-2) and R-2 of 0.869 for XGBoost), and the XGBoost models, by contrast, performed better. Both traditional and red-edge vegetation indices (VIs) obtained satisfactory results of AGB estimation (RMSE = 127.936 g center dot m(-2), RMSE = 125.879 g center dot m(-2) in XGBoost models, respectively), with the red-edge VIs contributed more to the AGB models. Moreover, we selected eight gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textures calculated by four processing window sizes using the mean value of four offsets, and further analyzed the results of three analysis sets. Textures derived from traditional and red-edge bands using a 7 x 7 window size performed better in biomass estimation. This finding suggested that textures derived from the traditional bands were as important as the red-edge bands. The introduction of textures moderately improved the accuracy of modeling AGB, whereas the use of textures alo ne was not satisfactory. This research demonstrated that using the Sentinel-2 MSI and the two ensemble algorithms is an effective method for long-term dynamic monitoring and assessment of grass AGB in seasonal floodplain wetlands, which can support sustainable management and carbon accounting of wetland ecosystems.

This review summarizes the latest science on how climate change is influencing Hg transport and biogeochemical cycling in Arctic terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. As environmental changes in the Arctic continue to accelerate, a clearer picture is emerging of the profound shifts in the climate and cryosphere, and their connections to Hg cycling. Modeling results suggest climate influences seasonal and interannual variability of atmospheric Hg deposition. The clearest evidence of current climate change effects is for Hg transport from terrestrial catchments, where widespread permafrost thaw, glacier melt and coastal erosion are increasing the export of Hg to downstreamenvironments. Recent estimates suggest Arctic permafrost is a large global reservoir of Hg, which is vulnerable to degradation with climate warming, although the fate of permafrost soil Hg is unclear. The increasing development of thermokarst features, the formation and expansion of thaw lakes, and increased soil erosion in terrestrial landscapes are increasing river transport of particulate-bound Hg and altering conditions for aquatic Hg transformations. Greater organic matter transport may also be influencing the downstream transport and fate of Hg. More severe and frequent wildfires within the Arctic and across boreal regions may be contributing to the atmospheric pool of Hg. Climate change influences on Hg biogeochemical cycling remain poorly understood. Seasonal evasion and retention of inorganic Hg may be altered by reduced sea-ice cover and higher chloride content in snow. Experimental evidence indicates warmer temperatures enhance methylmercury production in ocean and lake sediments as well as in tundra soils. Improved geographic coverage of measurements andmodeling approaches are needed to better evaluate net effects of climate change and long-term implications for Hg contamination in the Arctic.

Low grade uranium deposits of India - a bane or boon	ASIAN NUCLEAR PROSPECTS 2010	Energy Procedia				2nd International Conference on Asian Nuclear Prospects (ANUP)	OCT 10-13, 2010	Mamallapuram, INDIA	Indira Gandhi Ctr Atom Res (IGCAR)				Uranium resources of the world is estimated to be 5.5 million tonnes and the proven resources in India forms 3% of the world resources. The biggest uranium deposit is the Olympic dam deposit in Australia, which contains nearly 2.45 million tonnes of 0.023% U(3)O(8), while the highest average grade of nearly 21% is established in the McArthur river deposit, Canada. Another very high grade deposit, the Cigar lake deposit, is also in Canada with an average grade of nearly 18%. Most of the uranium deposits established in India so far falls under the category of low grade. These low grade uranium deposits are distributed mainly in Singhbhum Shear Zone, Jharkhand; in parts of Chhattisgarh; Southern parts of Meghalaya; Cuddapah Basin, Andhra Pradesh; in parts of Karnataka and Aravalli-and Delhi Supergroups, Rajasthan and Haryana. These deposits are mainly hydrothermal vein type, stratabound type and unconformity related. The Singhbhum Shear Zone, Jharkhand hosts seventeen low grade vein type uranium deposits, aggregating about 30% of Indian uranium resources. The stratabound uranium mineralisation hosted by Vempalle dolostone extends over 160 km belt along southwestern margin of Cuddapah Basin in Andhra Pradesh and accounts 23% of the Indian resources. Though the dolostone hosted Tummalapalle uranium deposit was established in the early nineties, because of techno-economic constraints, the deposit remained dormant. As a consequence of the development of an innovative pressure alkali leaching process, the deposit became economically viable and a mine and mill are being constructed here. Recent exploration inputs are leading more such strata-bound low grade uranium deposits in the extension areas of Tummalapalle. Nearly 10 blocks have been identified within a 30 km belt which are being actively explored and a large uranium deposit has already been proved in this province. The deposit at Tummalapalle and adjoining areas is likely to emerge as one of the larger deposits in the world. The northern parts of Cuddapah basin in Andhra Pradesh is the host for unconformity related low grade uranium deposits. Four low grade low to medium tonnage deposits viz. Lambapur, Peddagattu, Chitrial and Koppunuru have been established in this province along the contact between basement granite and Proterozoic sedimentary rocks. This province also holds promise for large tonnage-high grade mineralization in the deeper unexplored parts of the basin. The North Delhi Fold Belt in the states of Rajasthan and Haryana is the host for albitite/vein type uranium mineralization. A 320 km long NE-SW trending zone of deep seated fractures is the locus of mineralization and the mineralization is caused by soda metasomatism. A low grade uranium deposit is already established at Rohil associated with albitites and vast areas in this zone is open for exploration. The Cigar lake deposit, one of the two very high grade deposits in the world, though discovered in the year 1991 remains unexploited because of it high grade and requirement of remote handling and high end mining technology. The Mc Arthur deposit is being mined by raisebore mining method and the entire operation is carried out by 750 employees. Because of the high grade nature of the ore, it is diluted with barren rocks to bring the grade into manageable level before the beneficiation. The Rossing uranium deposit in Namibia, the biggest opencast mine for uranium, is of low grade and produces nearly 8% of the global output. As a result of the massive mining and beneficiation operation, the employment ofmanpower is also very high compared to the high grade deposits. India, being a developing country with a high rate of unemployment, should treat the low grade deposits as an opportunity for employment. The operation of Rossing mine in Namibia is a shining example of as to how a low grade deposit could be economically exploited in the national interest and still be among the top five countries in terms of production. Inspite of mining the low grade resources, uranium mining industry in India provides direct and indirect employment to thousands of people and still operates in profit mode. Environmental concerns and radiation exposure to mining and milling personnel is negligible in the case of low grade deposits. The new mines, which are going to be opened in Tummalapalle, Andhra Pradesh; KPM (Domiasiat), Meghalaya; Gogi, Karnataka; Rohil, Rajasthan etc. will create substantial direct and indirect employment opportunities and transform the economy of these regions.

A comprehensive research on the shallow groundwater was performed in this study via geographical information system (GIS) and geochemical method to evaluate groundwater quality and health risks of shallow groundwater in Dongting Lake Plain. Eighty-seven samples were collected and the content of As and twelve other heavy metals (e.g., Al, Fe, Zn, Cu, Mo, Ni, Mn, Co, Ba, Pb, Cd, and Cr) in the samples were detected by inductively coupled plasmaemass spectrum (ICP-MS) technology. The water pollution situation was assessed using heavy metal contents and evaluation indices, and human health risks were evaluated on the basis of both carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic aspects. Results showed that the shallow groundwater quality is moderately to heavily contaminated and should be considered in some areas of the Li and Xiangjiang River coasts. Several regions have the potential of carcinogenic risks induced by As and the groundwater in some regions may have the risk of Cr carcinogenesis in the wet season. These findings suggested that the potential harm caused by Fe, Zn, Mn, Cr, and As pollution of groundwater, especially As and Cr in wet season, must be considered. The spatio-temporal study on the groundwater quality evaluation may be beneficial to the protection and sustainable development of groundwater resources in Dongting Lake Plain.Summary: Although the overall noncarcinogenic health risk by metals in shallow groundwater of Dongting Lake is low, noncarcinogenic health risks caused by Fe, Zn, Mn, and As exist in some areas.

Assemblage-based biomonitoring of freshwater ecosystem health via multimetric indices: A critical review and suggestions for improving their applicability	WATER BIOLOGY AND SECURITY												Freshwater biota are more comprehensive and direct indicators of biological impacts, and more meaningful to the public than water quality or physical habitat surrogates. Freshwater biotic data and the multiple biological indicators developed from them offer a much richer array of data for assessing the impacts of pollution controls than a limited set of physical or chemical measures. In recent decades, assemblage-based assessments by ecologists, environmental scientists, and water quality agencies have been employed globally for determining the condition of, and threats to, freshwater ecosystems. A key step in this advance has been the development of multimetric indices (MMIs) or indices of biotic integrity (IBIs) based on quantitative assessments of algae, macrophyte, macroinvertebrate, fish or riparian bird assemblages. In Europe, where biological assemblages are mandated for assessing freshwater ecosystem health, many indices are multimetric. However, the proliferation of MMIs globally has not always occurred through the application of rigorous study designs and monitoring protocols, nor have they always effectively incorporated functional metrics, stressor assessments, and statistical analyses. Therefore, in this review, we discuss eleven major concerns with the development and application (including logistical limitations) of multimetric indicators based on freshwater biota to encourage more rigorous and widely applicable (transferable) MMI use and implementation. Specifically, our concerns focus on reference conditions; sampling effort, methods, and season; trophic guild definition; metric comprehensiveness, options, screening and scoring; and MMI validation. MMIs could also benefit from increased attention to ecological mechanisms and metric development, to further improve our understanding of anthropogenic impacts as well as rehabilitation effects on freshwater ecosystems globally. Paying closer attention to study designs, ecological mechanisms and metric development should further improve our understanding of anthropogenic impacts and better facilitate rehabilitation of degraded freshwater ecosystems, as well as aiding in the conservation of healthy freshwater ecosystems globally.

On the surface of the grounded ice sheet and floating ice shelves, extensive networks of lakes, streams and rivers both store and transport water. As melting increases with a warming climate, the surface hydrology of Antarctica in some regions could resemble Greenland's present-day ablation and percolation zones. Drawing on observations of widespread surface water in Antarctica and decades of study in Greenland, we consider three modes by which meltwater could impact Antarctic mass balance: increased runoff, meltwater injection to the bed and meltwater-induced ice-shelf fracture - all of which may contribute to future ice-sheet mass loss from Antarctica.

However, largely due to the dynamics of spatiotemporal surface water-groundwater interaction, the spatiotemporal successions of biogeochemical cycling in wetland groundwater remain poorly delineated. Herein, we investigated the seasonal coevolution of hydrogeochemical variables and microbial functional genes involved in nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, iron, and arsenic cycling in groundwater within a typical wetland, located in Poyang Lake Plain, China. During the dry season, the microbial potentials for dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium and ammonification were dominant, whereas the higher potentials for nitrogen fixation, denitrification, methane metabolism, and carbon fixation were identified in the wet season. A likely biogeochemical hotspot was identified in the area located in the low permeable aquifer near the lake, characterized by reducing conditions and elevated levels of Fe2+ (6.65-17.1 mg/L), NH4+ (0.57-3.98 mg/L), total organic carbon (1.02-1.99 mg/L), and functional genes. In contrast to dry season, higher dissimilarities of functional gene distribution were observed in the wet season. Multivariable statistics further indicated that the connection between the functional gene compositions and hydrogeochemical variables becomes less pronounced as the seasons transition from dry to wet. Despite this transition, Fe2+ remained the dominant driving force on gene distribution during both seasons. Gene-based co-occurrence network displayed reduced interconnectivity among coupled C-N-Fe-S cycles from the dry to the wet season, underpinning a less complex and more destabilizing occurrence pattern. The rising groundwater level may have contributed to a reduction in the stability of functional microbial communities, consequently impacting ecological functions. Our findings shed light on microbial-driven seasonal biogeochemical cycling in wetland groundwater.					; Xianglong, Chen/HKV-4073-2023; Liao, Fu/JZT-8008-2024; Zhang, Hongyu/GQB-3142-2022; Wei, yuquan/LYO-1639-2024; Sheng, Yizhi/AAF-4827-2021; Qiao, zhiyuan/MIP-9710-2025	Sheng, Yizhi/0000-0001-7285-4695; Mao, Hairu/0000-0002-0261-7579; Wei, Yuquan/0000-0002-1309-5139; 													0043-1354	1879-2448				MAR 1	2024	251								121105	10.1016/j.watres.2024.121105	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2024.121105		JAN 2024						38184913					WOS:001152590700001

Here we use Large Ensemble simulations conducted with the Community Earth System Model version 2, which includes a lake simulator, to quantify the response of lake ice to greenhouse warming and to determine emergence patterns of anthropogenic lake ice loss. Our model simulations show that the average duration of ice coverage and maximum ice thickness are projected to decrease over the next 80 years by 38 days and 0.23 m, respectively. In the Canadian Arctic, lake ice loss is accelerated by the cold-season polar amplification. Lake ice on the Tibetan Plateau decreases rapidly due to a combination of strong insolation forcing and ice-albedo feedbacks. Comparing the anthropogenic signal with natural variability represented by the Large Ensemble, we find that lake ecosystems in these regions may be exposed to no-analogue ice coverage within the next 4-5 decades.

J	Yang, K; Yu, ZY; Luo, Y				Yang, Kun; Yu, Zhenyu; Luo, Yi			Analysis on driving factors of lake surface water temperature for major lakes in Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau	WATER RESEARCH												Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is an important factor in lake ecological environments. It has been observed that LSWT have followed an upward trend in the last half century, which has had serious impacts on regional biodiversity and climate. It is important to understand the main reason for this phenomenon in order to have a basis for controlling and improving the regional ecological environment. In this study, the contribution rates of near surface air temperature (NSAT), surface pressure (SP), surface solar radiation (SSR), total cloud cover (TCC), wind speed (WS) and Secchi depth (SD) to LSWT of 11 naturally formed lakes in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau are quantified. The characteristics of and relationships between the various factors and LSWT in lakes of different types and attributes are revealed. The results show that: (1) from 2001 to 2018, most lakes were warming; the change rate of LSWT-day was higher than that of LSWT-night. The mean comprehensive warming rate (MCWR) of LSWT-day was 0.42 degrees C/decade, and the mean comprehensive change rate (MCCR) was 0.31 degrees C/decade; the MCWR of LSWT-night was 0.19 degrees C/decade, and the MCCR was 0.01 degrees C/decade. NSAT and SSR were most strongly correlated with LSWT-day/night. There were no large seasonal differences in the correlation between NSAT and LSWT-day, while seasonal differences in the correlations between NSAT with LSWTnight and SSR with LSWT-day/night were observed. (2) NSAT and SSR were the most important factors affecting LSWT-day/night changes, with contribution rates of 30.24% and 44.34%, respectively. LSWT-day was more affected by SP and SSR in small, shallow, and low-storage lakes. For larger lakes, LSWT-day was more affected by WS, while LSWT-night was greatly affected by TCC. Urban and semi-urban lakes were more affected by SSR and NSAT; for natural lakes, the decreasing SD affected the increases in LSWT, which indirectly reflects the impact of human activities. LSWT-day/night responded differently to different morphological characteristics of the lakes and different intensities of human activity. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies on algal blooms were mainly focused on relatively static water bodies (i.e., lakes and reservoirs), but less on the large rivers. As the largest tributary of the Yangtze River of China and the main freshwater source of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP), the Han River has experienced frequent algal blooms in recent decades. Here we investigated the algal blooms during a decade (2003-2014) in the Han River by two gradient boosting machine (GBM) models with k-fold cross validation, which used explanatory variables from current 10-day (GBMc model) or previous 10-day period (GBMp model). Our results advocate the use of GBMp due to its higher accuracy (median Kappa = 0.9) and practical predictability (using antecedent observations) compared to GBMc. We also revealed that the algal blooms in the Han River were significantly modulated by antecedent water levels in the Han River and the Yangtze River and water level variation in the Han River, whereas the nutrient concentrations in the Han River were usually above thresholds and not limiting algal blooms. This machine-learning-based study potentially provides scientific guidance for preemptive warning and risk management of river algal blooms through comprehensive regulation of water levels during the dry season by making use of water conservancy measures in large rivers.

In the past decades, it became a symbol of current climate change, held up by its dramatic shrinkage in the 1980s. Despites a partial recovery in response to increased Sahelian precipitation in the 1990s, Lake Chad is still facing major threats and its contemporary variability under climate change remains highly uncertain. Here, using a new multi-satellite approach, we show that Lake Chad extent has remained stable during the last two decades, despite a slight decrease of its northern pool. Moreover, since the 2000s, groundwater, which contributes to similar to 70% of Lake Chad's annual water storage change, is increasing due to water supply provided by its two main tributaries. Our results indicate that in tandem with groundwater and tropical origin of water supply, over the last two decades, Lake Chad is not shrinking and recovers seasonally its surface water extent and volume. This study provides a robust regional understanding of current hydrology and changes in the Lake Chad region, giving a basis for developing future climate adaptation strategies.

Here, the spatiotemporal patterns and factors that drive vegetation changes in the Dongting Lake wetland from 2000 to 2019 were analyzed using monthly normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data at a 30 m spatial resolution. First, abrupt vegetation changes were identified using the breaks for additive season and trend approach. Moreover, the relative impacts of climatic factors on monthly vegetation changes were quantified using a partial correlation-based approach, and the effects of three specific climatic factors (temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation) and human factors on vegetation recovery and degradation were determined. Our study found that: 1) the study area is becoming greener, with NDVI increases of 0.006 per year; however, there was a pronounced interannual variation in the vegetation types; 2) more than 50% of the vegetation pixels exhibited at least two breakpoints, with similar to 5% of the vegetation pixels exhibiting eight breakpoints; 3) in the past 20 years, human activities have favored wetland vegetation recovery (58.85%), whereas climate change threatens wetland vegetation (59.19%). Regarding climate factors, the influence of solar radiation on vegetation was found to be stronger than that of temperature and precipitation. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

J	HAYES, FR; PHILLIPS, JE				HAYES, FR; PHILLIPS, JE			LAKE WATER AND SEDIMENT .4. RADIOPHOSPHORUS EQUILIBRIUM WITH MUD, PLANTS, AND BACTERIA UNDER OXIDIZED AND REDUCED CONDITIONS	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The phosphorus equilibration pattern and rate between mud and water was the same in natural Jenkin sampler cores, in artificial cores, and in bottles in which dredged surface mud was packed by centrifuge. Thus any specific natural physico-chemical or bacteriological layering of the surface muds of lakes is relatively unimportant in phosphorus exchange. Phytoplankton or bacterial cells equilibrate within a few minutes after addition. When antibiotics are used the p32 remains as inorganic PO4 and is rapidly taken up by higher plants, or in the absence of plants, there is a rapid loss of p32 to the mud. With 1 exception, in over 100 artificial systems tested, the amount of p32 remaining in the water at equilibrium was greater in the presence of bacteria than where antibiotic had been added. This was true whether the system was treated with nitrogen or air, i.e., was aerobic or anaerobic. After a week less than 10% of the p32 remained in the water of an antibiotic treated sample, while two thirds remained in the control. The remarkable ability of bacteria to hold phosphorus in the water might be accomplished in 2 ways: (1) By an acceleration of the rate of P** return from the sediment to the water by bacteria in the mud. In all experiments while the turnover time of water was generally of the same order of magnitude for all systems, the turnover time for mud was much shorter in the controls than in the antibiotic treated systems. (2) By the rapid uptake of radiophosphate by water bacteria and their ability to hold the radiophosphorus from the chemical or colloidal adsorption mechanism of the mud, which would be accomplished by incorporating the phosphate into non-participating organic compounds. An affinity, or holding back by water bacteria of p32 would be indistinguishable from an accelerated return to the water from the mud. Dead plankton deposited on the mud decay and greatly increase the removal of P32 from the water. This reaction also is blocked by antibiotics. In bottle experiments there is a natural fall-out of bacterial cells of about 4%/day. Neither the redox state of the system nor the level of lake productivity could be shown to influence either living or inorganic exchanges. The events following addition of radiophosphorus can be described as a modified 1st order consecutive reaction in which PO4 yields organic P in the bodies of bacteria which in turn yields organic soluble phosphorus to the water. The rate of exchange is measured as turnover time, which is the time required for the appearance or disappearance of as much phosphorus as is present in the test material, say phytoplankton or water or mud. Some turnover times are: water of a whole lake, 1 week; water in a bottle over mud, 0.5 week; return from lake sediment in nature including rooted aquatics, 1 month; from mud in a bottle, 0.5 week; from bottle mud without bacteria, 2 weeks. Equilibration of PO4 between water and the inside of bacterial or phytoplankton cells is almost immediate, say 5 minutes, but conversion to the organic state is slower with average turnover time 0.3 days. Rooted aquatics, probably cannot take up organic P; with inorganic P their time is 0.5 week. Zooplankton are opposite in behavior, unable to use phosphorus until bacteria have made it organic; their time is then 1 day.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1958	3	4					459	475		10.4319/lo.1958.3.4.0459	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1958.3.4.0459													WOS:A1958WY36100013

The models and the ensemble mean were assessed based on the ability to reproduce the annual climatology, seasonal rainfall distribution and trend. Statistical metrics used include mean bias error, normalized root mean square error, and pattern correlation coefficient. The Taylor diagram and Taylor skill score (TSS) were used in ranking the models. The models' performance varies greatly from one season to the other. The models reproduced the observed bimodal rainfall pattern of March to May (MAM) and September to November (SON) occurring over the region. Some models slightly overestimated, while some slightly underestimated, the MAM rainfall. However, there was a high rainfall overestimation during SON by most models. The models showed a positive spatial correlation with observed dataset, whereas a low correlation was shown inter-annually. Some models could not capture the rainfall patterns around local-scale features, for example, around the Lake Victoria basin and mountainous areas. The best performing models identified in the study include GFDL-ESM4, CanESM5, CESM2-WACCM, MRI-ESM2-0, NorESM2-LM, UKESM1-0-LL, and CNRM-CM6-1. The models CNRM-CM6-1, and CNRM-ESM2 underestimated rainfall throughout the annual cycle and mean climatology. However, these two models better reproduced the spatial trends of rainfall during both MAM and SON. Caution should be taken when employing the models in seasonal climate change studies as their performance varies from one season to another. The model spread in CMIP6 over the study area also calls for further investigation on the attributions and possible implementation of robust approaches of machine learning to minimize the biases.

Humic substances-part 7: the biogeochemistry of dissolved organic carbon and its interactions with climate change	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Dissolved organic matter, measured as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), is an important component of aquatic ecosystems and of the global carbon cycle. It is known that changes in DOC quality and quantity are likely to have ecological repercussions. This review has four goals: (1) to discuss potential mechanisms responsible for recent changes in aquatic DOC concentrations; (2) to provide a comprehensive overview of the interactions between DOC, nutrients, and trace metals in mainly boreal environments; (3) to explore the impact of climate change on DOC and the subsequent effects on nutrients and trace metals; and (4) to explore the potential impact of DOC cycling on climate change. We review recent research on the mechanisms responsible for recent changes in aquatic DOC concentrations, DOC interactions with trace metals, N, and P, and on the possible impacts of climate change on DOC in mainly boreal lakes. We then speculate on how climate change may affect DOC export and in-lake processing and how these changes might alter nutrient and metal export and processing. Furthermore, the potential impacts of changing DOC cycling patterns on climate change are examined. It has been noted that DOC concentrations in lake and stream waters have increased during the last 30 years across much of Europe and North America. The potential reasons for this increase include increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, climate warming, continued N deposition, decreased sulfate deposition, and hydrological changes due to increased precipitation, droughts, and land use changes. Any change in DOC concentrations and properties in lakes and streams will also impact the acid-base chemistry of these waters and, presumably, the biological, chemical, and photochemical reactions taking place. For example, the interaction of trace metals with DOC may be significantly altered by climate change as organically complexed metals such as Cu, Fe, and Al are released during photo-oxidation of DOC. The production and loss of DOC as CO2 from boreal lakes may also be affected by changing climate. Climate change is unlikely to be uniform spatially with some regions becoming wetter while others become drier. As a result, rates of change in DOC export and concentrations will vary regionally and the changes may be non-linear. Climate change models predict that higher temperatures are likely to occur over most of the boreal forests in North America, Europe, and Asia over the next century. Climate change is also expected to affect the severity and frequency of storm and drought events. Two general climate scenarios emerge with which to examine possible DOC trends: warmer and wetter or warmer and drier. Increasing temperature and hydrological changes (specifically, runoff) are likely to lead to changes in the quality and quantity of DOC export from terrestrial sources to rivers and lakes as well as changes in DOC processing rates in lakes. This will alter the quality and concentrations of DOC and its constituents as well as its interactions with trace metals and the availability of nutrients. In addition, export rates of nutrients and metals will also change in response to changing runoff. Processing of DOC within lakes may impact climate depending on the extent to which DOC is mineralized to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and evaded to the atmosphere or settles as particulate organic carbon (POC) to bottom sediments and thereby remaining in the lake. The partitioning of DOC between sediments and the atmosphere is a function of pH. Decreased DOC concentrations may also limit the burial of sulfate, as FeS, in lake sediments, thereby contributing acidity to the water by increasing the formation of H2S. Under a warmer and drier scenario, if lake water levels fall, previously stored organic sediments may be exposed to greater aeration which would lead to greater CO2 evasion to the atmosphere. The interaction of trace metals with DOC may be significantly altered by climate change. Iron enhances the formation of POC during irradiation of lake water with UV light and therefore may be an important pathway for transfer of allochthonous DOC to the sediments. Therefore, changing Fe/DOC ratios could affect POC formation rates. If climate change results in altered DOC chemistry (e.g., fewer and/or weaker binding sites) more trace metals could be present in their toxic and bioavailable forms. The availability of nutrients may be significantly altered by climate change. Decreased DOC concentrations in lakes may result in increased Fe colloid formation and co-incident loss of adsorbable P from the water column. Climate change expressed as changes in runoff and temperature will likely result in changes in aquatic DOC quality and concentration with concomitant effects on trace metals and nutrients. Changes in the quality and concentration of DOC have implications for acid-base chemistry and for the speciation and bioavailability of certain trace metals and nutrients. Moreover, changes in DOC, metals, and nutrients are likely to drive changes in rates of C evasion and storage in lake sediments. The key controls on allochthonous DOC quality, quantity, and catchment export in response to climate change are still not fully understood. More detailed knowledge of these processes is required so that changes in DOC and its interactions with nutrients and trace metals can be better predicted based on changes caused by changing climate. More studies are needed concerning the effects of trace metals on DOC, the effects of changing DOC quality and quantity on trace metals and nutrients, and how runoff and temperature-related changes in DOC export affect metal and nutrient export to rivers and lakes.

Therefore, understanding changes in global precipitation is of great importance to comprehend and solve water security problems. This study analyzed the characteristics of drought and flood alternation in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) based on precipitation data, and explored the driving forces of drought and flood alternation by combining relevant meteorological factors (i.e., temperature [Tem], relative humidity [Rh], wind speed [Win], and actual evaporation [ETa]) and teleconnection indices (i.e., Nino 3.4, Pacific Decadal Oscillation [PDO], Southern Oscillation Indices [SOI], North Pacific Index [NPI], and Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation [AMO]). The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The spatial and temporal characteristics of precipitation in the sub-basins of the YRB varied widely, with significant annual precipitation trends ranging from -5 to 9 mm/year < (p < 0.05). The maximum temporal difference in the rainy season reached 1-2 months; (2) The mutations of precipitation in the period of pre-flood (P-P), precipitation in the period of post-flood (P-N), and long-cycle drought-flood abrupt transition index (LDFAI) in sub-basins of the YRB (e.g., Mintuojiang River Basin [MRB], Wujiang River Basin [WRB], Dongting Lake Basin [DLRB], Yichang-Hukou Reach [YC-HK], Downstream of Hukou [DHKRB], and Taihu Lake Basin [TLRB]) were prominent from 2001 to 2011; and (3) both the single factor (i.e., meteorological factors or teleconnection index) and multiple factors (i. e., meteorological factors and teleconnection index) influenced the LDFAI of each sub-basin in the YRB. Related research is important and useful for studying dry-wet changes and water security issues in the YRB.

This review presents a worldwide analysis of 132 reports of caffeine residues in freshwater environments. The results indicated that more than 70% of the studies reported were from Asia and Europe, which have densely populated and industrially developed areas. However, caffeine pollution was also found to affect areas isolated from human influence, such as Antarctica. In addition, the maximum concentrations of caffeine in raw wastewater, treated wastewater, river, drinking water, groundwater, lake, catchment, reservoir, and rainwater samples were reported to be 3.60 mg/L, 55.5, 19.3, 3.39, 0.683, 174, 44.6, 4.87, and 5.40 mu g/L, respectively. The seasonal variation in caffeine residues in the freshwater environment has been demonstrated. In addition, despite the fact that there was a small proportion of wastewater treatment plants in which the elimination rates of caffeine were below 60%, wastewater treatment is generally believed to have a high caffeine removal efficiency. From a pharmacy perspective, we proposed to adopt effective measures to minimize the environmental risks posed by PhACs, represented by caffeine, through a new concept known as ecopharmacovigilance (EPV). Some measures of EPV aimed at caffeine pollution have been advised, as follows: improving knowledge and perceptions about caffeine pollution among the public; listing caffeine as a high-priority PhAC pollutant, which should be targeted in EPV practices; promoting green design and production, rational consumption, and environmentally preferred disposal of caffeinated medicines, foods, and beverages; implementing intensive EPV measures in high-risk areas and during high-risk seasons; and integrating EPV into wastewater treatment programs.

The purpose of this study was to analyze runoff and SL from different land use types and evaluate the effectiveness of different SLM practices through monitoring runoff and sediment from 42 runoff plots (30 m x 6 m) in different agro-ecologies of the Upper Blue Nile basin of Ethiopia. Four treatments for croplands (control, soil bund, Fanya juu, and soil bund reinforced with grass) and three treatments for non-croplands (control, exclosure, and exclosure with trenches) were investigated during the rainy seasons. The results showed that runoff and SL varied greatly depending on agro-ecology, land use type, and SLM practice. Seasonal runoff ranged from 52 to 810 mm in 2015 and 37 to 898 mm in 2016, whereas SL ranged from 0.07 to 39.67 t ha(-1) and 0.01 to 24.70 t ha(-1). The highest rates were observed from untreated grazing land in the midland agro-ecology, largely because of heavy grazing and the occurrence of intense rain events. Runoff and SL were both significantly lower (P < 0.05) in SLM plots than in control plots. On average, seasonal runoff was reduced by 11% to 68%, and SL by 38% to 94% in SLM plots. Soil bund reinforced with grass in croplands and exclosure with trenches in non-croplands were found to be the most effective SLM practices for reducing both runoff and SL. Integrating structural and vegetative measures was therefore found to be the best way to control soil erosion and its consequences. Additional investigation is needed in consideration of ecological succession and other possible effects of these types of integrated measures, for example, the effects on soil properties, biomass, and biodiversity.

The satellite data were calibrated to targets of known ground reflectance factors and processed with radiative transfer techniques to yield aerosol (dust) optical depth at those stages of the dust storm when concurrent ground-based measurements of optical depth were made. Calibration of the satellite data is crucial for comparing surficial changes in remotely sensed data acquired over a period of time from the same area and for determining accurate concentrations of atmospheric aerosols using radiative transfer techniques. The calibration procedure forces the distribution of visible-band, DN (digital number) values, acquired on July 1, 1992, at 1731 GMT from the GOES-VISSR sensor over a large test area, to match the distribution of visible-band, DN values concurrently acquired from a Landsat MSS (Multispectral Scanner) sensor over the same test area; the Landsat MSS DN values were directly associated with reflectance factors measured from ground targets. The calibrated GOES-VISSR data for July 1, 1992, were then used to calibrate other GOES-VISSR data acquired on March 10 and 11, 1993, during the dust storm, Uncertainties in location of ground targets, bi-directional reflectance and atmospheric attenuation contribute an error of approximately +/-0.02 in the satellite-inferred ground reflectance factors. On March 11 at 1031 PST the satellite-received radiances during the peak of the storm were 3 times larger than predicted by our radiative transfer model for a pure clay dust plume of infinite optical depth. This result supported ground-based measurements that the plume at that time was composed primarily of large salt grains, probably sodium sulfate, which could not be properly characterized in our radiative transfer model. Further, the satellite data showed that the salt fell out of the plume within 35 km from the source. Finer-grained, clay dust was observed to extend beyond the salt-laden plume and was the major component of the dust plume after 1131 PST, when erosion of the salt crust on Owens Lake ceased. By 1331 and 1401 PST satellite-inferred, optical depths compared favorably with measurements concurrently acquired at the ground. Uncertainties in bi-directional reflectance, atmospheric attenuation, and locating ground points in the satellite data manifest errors between the inferred and measured optical depths in the range of 20 to 50%; these errors would be much greater without the calibration of the GOES-VISSR data. Changes in satellite-inferred reflectance factors over the lake bed during the course of the storm showed that 76 km(2) of the surface was disrupted during the March 11 storm, suggesting as much as 76 x 10(3) m(3) of crustal material were displaced for each millimeter of several estimated to have been moved during the storm; an unknown fraction of the displaced material was suspended. The satellite data also showed dust fallout on mountain snowfields. Whereas fallout may have removed most of the salt, satellite data acquired at 1631 PST, when the plume had a large brightness contrast with the ground, showed that it covered over 2500 km(2) and contained at least 1.6 x 10(9) g of sediment. For such a small source area, the dust represents a substantial contribution to the regional and global load of aerosols.

Inland waters can be an important source of methane and nitrous oxide emissions as well, but emissions are poorly quantified, especially in Africa. Here we report dissolved carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide concentrations from 12 rivers in sub-Saharan Africa, including seasonally resolved sampling at 39 sites, acquired between 2006 and 2014. Fluxes were calculated from published gas transfer velocities, and upscaled to the area of all sub-Saharan African rivers using available spatial data sets. Carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions from river channels alone were about 0.4 Pg carbon per year, equivalent to two-thirds of the overall net carbon land sink previously reported for Africa. Including emissions from wetlands of the Congo river increases the total carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse-gas emissions to about 0.9 Pg carbon per year, equivalent to about one quarter of the global ocean and terrestrial combined carbon sink. Riverine carbon dioxide and methane emissions increase with wetland extent and upland biomass. We therefore suggest that future changes in wetland and upland cover could strongly affect greenhouse-gas emissions from African inland waters.

Regionalization and Homogenization of Estimates	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Inland waters are important sources of the greenhouse gasses (GHGs) carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) to the atmosphere. In the framework of the second phase of the REgional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes (RECCAP-2) initiative, we synthesize existing estimates of GHG emissions from streams, rivers, lakes and reservoirs, and homogenize them with regard to underlying global maps of water surface area distribution and the effects of seasonal ice cover. We then produce regionalized estimates of GHG emissions over 10 extensive land regions. According to our synthesis, inland water GHG emissions have a global warming potential of an equivalent emission of 13.5 (9.9-20.1) and 8.3 (5.7-12.7) Pg CO2-eq. yr(-1) at a 20 and 100 years horizon (GWP(20) and GWP(100)), respectively. Contributions of CO2 dominate GWP(100), with rivers being the largest emitter. For GWP(20), lakes and rivers are equally important emitters, and the warming potential of CH4 is more important than that of CO2. Contributions from N2O are about two orders of magnitude lower. Normalized to the area of RECCAP-2 regions, S-America and SE-Asia show the highest emission rates, dominated by riverine CO2 emissions.

J	Gilbert, JJ				Gilbert, John J.			Food niches of planktonic rotifers: Diversification and implications	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The diverse diets of common planktonic rotifers are described in detail from field and laboratory observations and experiments. Also considered are methodological approaches, rotifer feeding mechanisms, and the availability in natural waters of less well-known food items (detritus, picoplankton, protozoans). Despite much variation among and within rotifer genera, food niches of planktonic rotifers can be subdivided into four broad, over-lapping categories defined by the predominant types and sizes of food ingested: (1) microphagous rotifers that eat fine detritus/organic aggregates, picoplankton, and 2-10 mu m nanoplankton; (2) polyphagous rotifers that eat the above items, larger nanoplankton, and small (20-50 mu m) microplankton; (3) macrophagous algivores that eat 5-50 mu m algae; and (4) macrophagous omnivores/predators that eat 5-250 mu m algae, protozoans, and metazoans. These diet-based categories have ecological advantages over categories based on rotifer morphology or feeding mode. The information on diets assembled here is important for understanding: (1) the population dynamics of planktonic rotifers and their food organisms; (2) the position of rotifers in classical and microbial food webs; (3) the seasonality, spatial distribution, and species diversity of rotifers in plankton communities; and (4) food overlap, and thus potential resource competition, among planktonic protozoans, rotifers, and crustaceans.

However, vulnerability due to pollutant concurrences, source apportionment, and identification of better faecal indicators needs to be better understood. The present study focuses on the vulnerability of urban Guwahati, the largest city in Northeastern India, through analyzing the concurrence of PPCPs, enteric viruses, antibiotic resistant bacteria, metal, and faecal contamination in water. The study strives to identify a relevant marker of anthropogenic pollution for the Indian scenario. Samples from the Brahmaputra River (n = 4), tributary Bharalu River (an unlined urban drain; n = 3), and Ramsar recognized Lake (Dipor Bil; n = 1) indicate caffeine > acetaminophen > theophylline > carbamazepine > crotamiton for PPCPs and pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) > aichi > hepatitis A > norovirus GII > norovirus GI for enteric viruses. PMMoV was the better indicator of faecal pollution due to its prevalence, specificity and ease of detection. Antibiotic resistance was neither correlated with the prevalence of PPCPs nor E. coli. As, Co and Mn appear to be inducing antibiotic resistance in E. coli. While the risk quotient of the urban drain (Bharalu River) indicates one order higher magnitude than reported for other Indian rivers, the Lake exhibited the least pollution and better resilience. The concurrence of pollutants and multi-drug resistant E. coli, owing to the complete absence of wastewater treatment, puts the city in a highly vulnerable state. Pollution is being regulated only by the dilution capability of the Brahmaputra River, which needs to be further researched for seasonal variation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies have paid considerable attention to the effect of multiple environmental factors on submerged macrophytes. Meanwhile, few studies have been conducted regarding the spatial and seasonal characteristics of water and sediment properties and their long-term relationship with submerged macrophytes after the implementation of the submerged macrophytes restoration project. On a monthly basis, we monitored the spatial and seasonal variation in water parameters, sediment properties, and the submerged macrophyte characteristics of West Lake in Hangzhou from August 2013 to July 2019. From these measurements, we characterized the relationship between environmental factors and submerged macrophytes. Water nutrient concentrations continuously decreased with time, and the accumulation of sediment nutrients was accelerated as the submerged macrophyte communities developed on a long-term scale. The results indicated that the difference in water parameters was due to seasonal changes and land-use types in the watershed. The differences in the sediment properties were mainly attributed to seasonal changes and changes in the flow field. Redundancy analysis showed that the influence of water nutrients on the submerged macrophyte distribution was greater than that of sediment nutrients. The result also suggested that the developed root system, high stoichiometric homeostasis coefficients of P, and compensation ability of substantial leaf tissue may lead to a large distribution of Vallisneria natans in West Lake in Hangzhou. The correlation of water parameters and sediment properties with submerged macrophytes for a long time was very important as the restoration was achieved. To ensure the stability of the aquatic ecosystem after performing the submerged macrophyte restoration, a greater emphasis must be placed on reestablishing the entire ecosystem, including the restoration of aquatic animals and fish stocks. We expect these findings to serve as a reference for researchers and government agencies in the field of aquatic ecosystem restoration. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Abbasi, S; Turner, A; Hoseini, M; Amiri, H				Abbasi, Sajjad; Turner, Andrew; Hoseini, Mohammad; Amiri, Hoda			Microplastics in the Lut and Kavir Deserts, Iran	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Although microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants, little is known about their occurrence and behavior in the terrestrial setting. In this study, MPs have been isolated from soils collected from various geomorphological features (yardangs, sand dunes, moving sands, seasonal lakes) of the Kavir and Lut Deserts on the Iranian plateau. The number of MPs identified in 300 g samples ranged from zero (not detected) in several yardang tops to 25 on some yardang hillsides, with an overall average abundance of about 0.02 MP g(-1). The majority of MPs were of a fibrous nature with a size distribution (<= 100 mu m to >= 1000 mu m) skewed toward the lower end, and analysis of a selection of particles by mu-Raman spectroscopy showed that polyethylene terephthalate and Nylon (polyamide) were the principal polymers. Scanning electron microscopy revealed intense degradation of some particles but limited weathering of others. With little evidence of meso- and macroplastics in the deserts, it appears that the majority of MPs are brought into these environments from distant sources via the wind, with smaller, seasonal contributions from runoff associated with the adjacent mountains. It is proposed that some windborne MPs are transported through the deserts relatively rapidly, while others are subject to internal recycling and significant photo-oxidation and mechanical weathering.					; Abbasi, Sajjad/AAU-7298-2020; Amiri, Hoda/ABD-1578-2020; Turner, Andrew/AAI-8829-2020; Hoseini, Mohammad/M-6971-2017	Turner, Andrew/0000-0003-0505-4561; Amiri, Hoda/0000-0002-5272-6028; Abbasi, Sajjad/0000-0002-5194-9334; Hoseini, Mohammad/0000-0001-5180-3047													0013-936X	1520-5851				MAY 4	2021	55	9					5993	6000		10.1021/acs.est.1c00615	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c00615		APR 2021						33852274					WOS:000648515400039

The maximum concentrations of sulfadiazine, oxytetracycline, and doxycycline were 56.2, 48.7, and 39.7 ng/L, respectively. Compared with those in the other lakes or surface waters, the surface water of Poyang Lake contained moderate or below-average levels of antibiotics. The significantly lower concentrations (P < 0.01) of roxithromycin in June 2015 likely resulted from the dilution effect of water flow during the flood season. Antibiotic concentrations were higher in site P3-1 than in other sites (P < 0.01), whereas those in other sites (P1-1, P2-1, P5-1, P6-1, P7-1, P13-1, P16-1, P17-1, P18-1) were not significantly different (P > 0.05). Given that tetracyclines and sulfonamides are common veterinary medicines, the high concentrations of oxytetracycline, doxycycline, and sulfadiazine in site P3-1 might be closely related to agricultural production in the surrounding areas. The risk assessment of the main antibiotic contaminants revealed that the majority of the risk quotients of the target antibiotics were below 0.01, thereby indicating the minimal risk of these antibiotics to organisms at three different trophic levels. Sulfadimidine and sulfadiazine were identified as the main antibiotics that contribute to ecological risk in Poyang Lake, and that the daphnid is the main model organisni exposed to these risks. This study provides important data for antibiotic pollution control and environmental protection in the study area and enriches environmental monitoring data on a global scale. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Lakes are considered to be antibiotic-rich reservoirs because many of the antibiotics discharged from rivers enter lakes. Chaohu Lake is one of the top five freshwater lakes in China. This study aims to provide a current evaluation of the antibiotics present in the surface water of the Chaohu Lake basin. To this end, the occurrences of 18 antibiotics categorized into 5 different groups were investigated in the study area, and the impact of inflowing rivers on their distribution was assessed. The results showed that the concentrations of 14 antibiotics in water samples ranged from 0 to 892 ng/L, and that antibiotics were detected at most sampling sites. Among them, the Nanfeihe and Shiwulihe rivers, which are close to the city, contributed the most to antibiotic pollution, indicating the widespread occurrence of antibiotics in the study area. A risk assessment based on the risk quotient method indicated that ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, and norfloxacin in the lake water posed a high ecological risk to algae, while sulfamethazine posed a high risk to plants (RQ >1).

Dianchi Lake is a heavily eutrophic plateau lake in China. To investigate the fluorescence characteristics of DOM and the influences of DOM on water quality of rivers and lakes in the Dianchi Lake basin, three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry were employed to determine the features of dissolved organic matter (DOM) components. According to the research results, the DOM components in rivers and lakes in the Dianchi Lake basin were dominated by humic-like substances and affected by seasonal changes to a certain extent. DOM in Dianchi Lake is affected by the macrophytes and algae distribution as well as inflowing rivers, but the dominant factors are different in dry and rainy seasons. PCA results indicated that DOM components had relatively high relevance to water quality indicators, especially COD and TN.

Exploring the associations between land use, landscape pattern, and riverine water quality can inform land-use planning for water-quality security. In northwest China's Jing River Watershed (JRW), water samples were collected at 67 points in 2016-2017 and analyzed. Coupled with Sentinel-2 remote-sensing images, this study calculated the Canadian Water Quality Index (CWQI) to assign the water-quality category. The Random Forest classification characterized current LULC patterns and computed landscape metrics in a riparian buffer zone. The stepwise multiple linear regression and redundancy analysis methods investigated the relationships amongst LULC, eight landscape metrics, and eight water-quality parameters. The results indicated high concentrations of total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) in the JRW's middle and lower reaches. For CWQI, lacking evident temporal fluctuations was contrasted by noticeable spatial variations. Intense Human activities have aggravated the deterioration of the water quality of the JRW. LULC-type changes, including Waterbody, Forest-grassland, and Farmland, imposed notable impacts on seasonal water quality. For landscape metrics, patch cohesion index (COHESION) strongly correlated with chemical oxygen demand (COD), mineralization degree (MD), and TN. By contrast, patch density (PD) correlated negatively with TN. Interspersion juxtaposition index (IJI) strongly correlated with biochemical oxygen demand after five days (BOD5). COHESION, PD, and IJI can be critical factors in predicting water-quality changes at the small-watershed scale. Our findings offered a robust scientific basis to refine regional sustainable water development strategy and rational water-resource management.

As a branch of artificial intelligence, machine learning acquires new knowledge through self-learning and continuously improves its own performance. The purpose of this study is to combine Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (MSI) data and MSI-derived covariates with measured soil salinity data and to apply three machine learning algorithms in modeling to estimate and map the soil salinity in the study sample area. According to the convenient transportation conditions, the study area and sampling quadrat were set up, and the 5-point method was used to collect the soil mixed samples, and 160 soil mixed samples were collected. Kennard-Stone (K-S) algorithm was used for sample classification, 70% for modeling and 30% for verification. The machine learning algorithm uses Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Random Forest (RF). The results showed that (1) the average reflectance of each band of the MSI data ranged from 0.21-0.28. According to the spectral characteristics corresponding to different soil electrical conductivity (EC) levels (1.07-79.6 dS m(-1)), the spectral reflectance of salinized soil in the MSI data ranged from 0.09-0.35. (2) The correlation coefficient between the MSI data and MSI-derived covariates and soil EC was moderate, and the correlation between certain MSI data sets and soil EC was not significant. (3) The SVM soil EC estimation model established with the MSI data set attained a higher performance and accuracy (R-2 = 0.88, root mean square error (RMSE) = 4.89 dS m(-1), and ratio of the performance to the interquartile range (RPIQ) = 1.96, standard error of the laboratory measurements to the standard error of the predictions (SEL/SEP) = 1.11) than those attained with the soil EC estimation models established with the RF and ANN models. (4) We applied the SVM soil EC estimation model to map the soil salinity in the study area, which showed that the farmland with higher altitudes discharged a large amount of salt to the surroundings due to long-term irrigation, and the secondary salinization of the farmland also caused a large amount of salt accumulation. This research provides a scientific basis for the simulation of soil salinization scenarios in arid areas in the future.					zhang, huaping/KQU-3923-2024; Yin, Caiyun/LPP-7082-2024; Wang, Jiaqiang/HHN-9059-2022; Wang, Tianwei/V-4303-2018	Li, Hongyi/0000-0003-2609-5805; Liu, Haibo/0000-0002-4213-2883; Wang, Jiaqiang/0000-0003-0202-2046; Wang, Tianwei/0000-0003-4235-6438														2072-4292				JAN	2021	13	2							305	10.3390/rs13020305	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13020305													WOS:000611547700001

Reservoir operations for each member of an ESP are individually modeled to forecast system conditions and calculate risk of reaching critical operational thresholds. Reservoir release decisions are simulated to manage forecasted risk with respect to established risk tolerance levels. EFO was developed for Lake Mendocino, a 111,000 acre-foot reservoir near Ukiah, California, to evaluate its viability to improve reservoir storage reliability without increasing downstream flood risk. Lake Mendocino is a dual use reservoir, owned and operated for flood control by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and operated for water supply by Sonoma Water. EFO was simulated using a 26-year (1985-2010) ESP hindcast generated by the California-Nevada River Forecast Center, which provides 61-member ensembles of 15-day flow forecasts. EFO simulations yield generally higher storage levels during the flood management season while maintaining needed flood storage capacity by strategically prereleasing water in advance of forecasted storms. Model results demonstrate a 33% increase in median storage at the end of the flood management season (10 May) over existing operations without marked changes in flood frequency for locations downstream from Lake Mendocino. EFO may be a viable alternative for managing flood control operations at Lake Mendocino that provides multiple benefits (water supply, flood mitigation, and ecosystems) and provides a management framework that could be adapted and applied to other flood control reservoirs.

Lake diatom responses to warming: reviewing the evidence	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Algae, the dominant primary producers in many aquatic ecosystems, are critical to global biogeochemical cycling, and changes in their abundance and composition can cascade throughout aquatic food webs. Diatoms often dominate the algal communities in many freshwater systems. Their population dynamics are affected by a variety of environmental variables, many of which are linked to changes in water column properties and habitat availability, which themselves can be linked to shifts in ice cover, length of the growing season, thermal stability and stratification, vertical mixing patterns, habitat alterations, and the availability of resources such as light and nutrients. Climate has strong moderating controls on all of these fundamental aquatic processes, which can directly and indirectly alter species composition, abundance and seasonal dynamics of both periphytic and planktonic diatoms. In this review, we examine the role that climate-mediated alterations in inter-related lake processes have played on diatom community composition, dynamics and size structure, with particular attention to the recent success of planktonic diatom species relative to heavier tychoplanktonic and small benthic diatoms. We focus primarily on paleolimnological records, but also reference a wide spectrum of limnological and physiological studies to review and discuss how climate-driven shifts in lake properties may affect diatom assemblage reorganization. Understanding the limnological and historical context of these often complex diatom changes is key to making scientifically defensible interpretations of paleolimnological records. We further evaluate the plausibility of alternative explanations (e.g. atmospheric nitrogen deposition) for the recent success of small cyclotelloid species by examining trends in these planktonic diatoms from a large number of sites. Using a weight-of-evidence approach, we conclude that recent climate change is the main driver that has led to ecological tipping points resulting in the recent success of small planktonic diatoms that have been reported in many aquatic systems.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				JUN	2015	54	1					1	35		10.1007/s10933-015-9837-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-015-9837-3													WOS:000355218100001

Herein, monitoring data were collected during the nonwater diversion period (NWDP) and the water diversion period (WDP) from 2018 to 2019, and the index of biological integrity (IBI) method based on phytoplankton communities was used to evaluate the ecological health of the impounded lakes (Nansi Lake and Dongping Lake) along the eastern route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. The results demonstrated that water diversion improved the water quality of the impounded lakes during the WDP, especially total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen. Meanwhile, the water diversion affected the phytoplankton community structure and diversity, and network analysis further revealed water diversion could be beneficial to the ecological health of impounded lakes. Furthermore, the P-IBI showed that the overall ecological health assessment was "good " during the WDP. Water diversion substantially improved the ecological health status and stability of the impounded lakes during the dry season. Finally, the direct correlations between the water quality parameters and the P-IBI were weak, and water quality parameters could indirectly affect the P-IBI by changing the phytoplankton community structure. These findings will enhance our understanding of the ecological health of the impounded lakes of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. Furthermore, this study will provide a reference to support the ecosystem security of impounded lakes in other large water diversion projects.

Diurnal Cycle of IMERG V06 Precipitation	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												This study demonstrates the maturing ability of the half-hourly precipitation estimates from the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) for use in global analyses of the diurnal cycle. The refined intercalibration and interpolation between the sensors in V06 leads to greater consistency in the precipitation retrievals over different hours of the day. Evaluation against ground measurements suggests a slight lag in the diurnal phase of only +0.59 hr. We demonstrate the diurnal cycle over different regions around the globe, including the Maritime Continent, where accurate representation of precipitation variability in global models remains a challenge. Using examples over Singapore, Bangladesh, and Lake Victoria, we reveal the intricate interplay between diurnal and seasonal variability. This study demonstrates the unprecedented capability of IMERG in capturing the diurnal cycle of precipitation globally, potentially advancing our understanding in regions of sparse ground measurements and supporting improvements in its representation in global models.

M.			What we talk about when we talk about seasonality - A transdisciplinary review	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												The role of seasonality is indisputable in climate and ecosystem dynamics. Seasonal temperature and precipitation variability are of vital importance for the availability of food, water, shelter, migration routes, and raw materials. Thus, understanding past climatic and environmental changes at seasonal scale is equally important for unearthing the history and for predicting the future of human societies under global warming scenarios. Alas, in palaeoenvironmental research, the term 'seasonality change' is often used liberally without scrutiny or explanation as to which seasonal parameter has changed and how. Here we provide fundamentals of climate seasonality and break it down into external (insolation changes) and internal (atmospheric CO2 concentration) forcing, and regional and local and modulating factors (continentality, altitude, large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns). Further, we present a brief overview of the archives with potentially annual/seasonal resolution (historical and instrumental records, marine invertebrate growth increments, stalagmites, tree rings, lake sediments, permafrost, cave ice, and ice cores) and discuss archive-specific challenges and opportunities, and how these limit or foster the use of specific archives in archaeological research. Next, we address the need for adequate data-quality checks, involving both archive-specific nature (e.g., limited sampling resolution or seasonal sampling bias) and analytical uncertainties. To this end, we present a broad spectrum of carefully selected statistical methods which can be applied to analyze annually- and seasonally-resolved time series. We close the manuscript by proposing a framework for transparent communication of seasonality-related research across different communities.					; Nehme, Carole/D-2891-2016; Marwan, Norbert/D-9576-2011; Brunello, Camilla/ABY-1286-2022; Breitenbach, Sebastian/AAB-1420-2019; Opel, Thomas/O-9037-2014; Brunello, Camilla F./ABY-1286-2022; Breitenbach, Sebastian/LZG-9510-2025; Hoggarth, Julie/N-5798-2015; Ionita, Monica/AAX-3171-2020; Hausmann, Niklas/AAF-3539-2019; Braun, Tobias/KWT-4225-2024; Petrie, Cameron/ABB-8528-2021; Kwiecien, Ola/AAZ-6408-2021	Braun, Tobias/0000-0002-3095-8960; Nehme, Carole/0000-0003-0004-0910; Kwiecien, Ola/0000-0001-6018-9181; Saarni, Saija/0000-0003-2050-3062; Wolf, Annabel/0000-0002-2910-874X; Breitenbach, Sebastian/0000-0001-9615-2065; Opel, Thomas/0000-0003-1315-8256; Brunello, Camilla F./0000-0002-4206-5852; Hausmann, Niklas/0000-0002-4381-8334; Ionita, Monica/0000-0001-8240-4380; 													0012-8252	1872-6828				FEB	2022	225								103843	10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.103843	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.103843		JAN 2022											WOS:000849987100001

This study presents a first attempt to combine hydrodynamic modeling and statistical methods to investigate hydrological connectivity and its relationship with the water quality of nine seasonal lakes within the floodplains of Poyang Lake (China). The hydrodynamic model reproduced reasonably well the hydrological regime of the lake and surrounding floodplains, based on field measurements and remote sensing data. Floodplain lakes exhibit similar water-level dynamics to the main lake during connected periods of flooding, while they decouple from the main lake during recession periods. Geostatistical results reveal that although the north-south hydrological connectivity extends over a longer pathway than the west-east connectivity, the rapid reduction in the west-east connectivity indicates a more sensitive response. The west-east connectivity tends to play a dominant role in affecting the interactions between the main lake and floodplains, as expected. Statistical methods indicate that surface hydrological connectivity across the floodplain results in an enhanced spatial similarity in the water quality of the floodplain lakes, in terms of a multitude of water quality parameters (TN, TP, NH4+-N, NO3--N, NO2--N, PO43-, CODMn, and Chl alpha), while surface hydrological isolation was observed to increase the water quality differences between the seasonal lakes. Additionally, enhanced hydrological connectivity may lead to improved water quality of the seasonal lakes from low connectivity to high connectivity condition. Hydrological connectivity may be a key factor controlling the dynamics in water quality between seasonal lakes. The findings of this study support the management of both Poyang Lake and the floodplain wetlands by providing important information on both water resource and water quality, and proposals to better manage the impacts of intensive human activities.

This study proposed an innovative deep learning convolutional neural network (DL-CNN) data-driven approach for SSD mapping. Multi-spectral remote sensing data encompassing Landsat series images provide the possibility for frequent assessment of SSD in various regions of the world. Therefore, Landsat 7 ETM+ and 8 OLI images were acquired for years 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2019. Totally, 704 sample points collected from the top 20 cm of the soil surface, which 70% was used to train the network and the remains (30%) were utilized to validate the network. Accordingly, DL-CNN model trained using remote sensing (RS)-derived variables (land surface temperature (LST), Soil moisture (SM) and evapotranspiration) and geospatial data such as NDVI and landuse. To train the CNN, ReLu, Cross-entropy and ADAM were employed respectively as activation, loss/cost functions and optimizer. The results indicated the high confidence of OA 0.94.02, 0.93.99, 0.94.87 and 0.95.0 respectively for years 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2019. These accuracies demonstrated the best performance of automated DL-CNN for SSD mapping compared to RS soil salinity indexes. Furthermore, the FR and WOE models applied in order to generate a geospatial assessment of the DL-CNN classification results. According to the FR model, landuse, LST, LST and NDVI with the frequency ratio of 0.98.25, 0.94.03, 0.97.23 and 0.96.36 selected respectively as more effective factors for SSD in the study area for years 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2019. Also based on the WOE model, landuse, LST, landuse and NDVI with the WOE of 0.88.25, 0.91.88, 0.87.43 and 0.89.02 were ranked respectively for years 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2019 as efficient variables for SSD. In sum, our introduced method can be recommended for SDD spatial modelling in other favored areas with similar environmental conditions. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wangchuk, S; Bolch, T				Wangchuk, Sonam; Bolch, Tobias			Mapping of glacial lakes using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data and a random forest classifier: Strengths and challenges	SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING												Glacial lakes pose a serious threat to downstream areas and significantly impact glacier melt. The number and area of lakes has grown in most regions during the last decades due to the ongoing atmospheric warming and retreating glaciers. It is therefore important to identify and monitor these lakes. However, mapping of glacial lakes in alpine regions is challenged by many factors. These factors include the small size of glacial lakes, cloud cover in optical satellite images, cast shadows from mountains and clouds, seasonal snow in satellite images, varying degrees of turbidity amongst glacial lakes, and frozen glacial lake surfaces. In our study, we have developed a fully automated method for mapping glacial lakes across alpine regions including the Python package called "GLakeMap". The method uses multi-source data such as Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument data, a digital elevation model, and a random forest classifier model. We use multi-source datasets as inputs for rule-based segmentation of images, mainly aiming at extracting glacial lake objects from satellite images using a set of rules. Segmented objects are then classified either as glacial lake or non-glacial lake objects by the random forest classifier model. The method was tested in eight sites across alpine regions mainly located in High Mountain Asia but also in the Alps and the Andes. We show that the proposed method overcomes a majority of the aforementioned challenges to detect and delineate glacial lakes. The method performs efficiently irrespective of geographic, geologic, and climatic conditions of glacial lakes.					; Wangchuk, Sonam/AGX-2730-2022; Bolch, Tobias/A-1935-2008; Bolch, Tobias/ABE-6635-2020	Wangchuk, Sonam/0000-0003-0897-1402; Bolch, Tobias/0000-0002-8201-5059; 													2666-0172					DEC	2020	2								100008	10.1016/j.srs.2020.100008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.srs.2020.100008													WOS:001007421900002

There is a great controversy about controlling only phosphorus or controlling both nitrogen and phosphorus in the management of lake eutrophication. The primary argument against the dual nutrients control of eutrophication is that nitrogen fixation can compensate the nitrogen deficits. Thus, it is of great necessary to study the factors that can significantly affect the nitrogen fixation. Due to the difference of climate and human influence, the water quality of different lakes (such as water temperature, N:P ratio and water residence time) is also quite different. Numerous studies have reported that the low N:P ratio can intensify the nitrogen fixation capacities. However, the effects of temperature and water residence time on the nitrogen fixation remain unclear. Thus, 30 shallows freshwater lakes in the eastern plain of China were selected to measure dissolved N-2 and Ar concentrations through N-2: Ar method using a membrane inlet mass spectrometer to quantify the nitrogen fixation capacities and investigate whether the temperature and water residence time have a great impact on nitrogen fixation. The results have shown that the short lake water residence time can severely inhibit the nitrogen fixation capacities through inhibiting the growth of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, changing the N:P ratio and resuspending the solids from sediments. Similarly, lakes with low water temperature also have a low nitrogen fixation capacity, suggesting that controlling nitrogen in such lakes is feasible if the growth of cyanobacteria is limited by nitrogen.

Jeremy; Loftin, Keith A.; Meredith, Andrew			Measurement of Cyanobacterial Bloom Magnitude using Satellite Remote Sensing	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) are a serious environmental, water quality and public health issue worldwide because of their ability to form dense biomass and produce toxins. Models and algorithms have been developed to detect and quantify cyanoHABs biomass using remotely sensed data but not for quantifying bloom magnitude, information that would guide water quality management decisions. We propose a method to quantify seasonal and annual cyanoHAB magnitude in lakes and reservoirs. The magnitude is the spatiotemporal mean of weekly or biweekly maximum cyanobacteria biomass for the season or year. CyanoHAB biomass is quantified using a standard reflectance spectral shape-based algorithm that uses data from Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). We demonstrate the method to quantify annual and seasonal cyanoHAB magnitude in Florida and Ohio (USA) respectively during 2003-2011 and rank the lakes based on median magnitude over the study period. The new method can be applied to Sentinel-3 Ocean Land Color Imager (OLCI) data for assessment of cyanoHABs and the change over time, even with issues such as variable data acquisition frequency or sensor calibration uncertainties between satellites. CyanoHAB magnitude can support monitoring and management decision-making for recreational and drinking water sources.

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, considerable research focused on phytoplankton colony attached and free-living bacteria has revealed the close relationship between them, and indicated that the entire bacterial community mediates crucial biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems. However, our understanding of their distribution patterns and response to environmental factors remains poor. Besides, picocyanobacteria, which were omitted from attached bacteria analysis, were reported to be important in cyanobacterial blooms. To explore the spatiotemporal variation of the entire bacterial community with their driving environmental factors and detect the relationships among them, we collected 61water samples spanning one year and the entire Lake Taihu regions for surveying the entire bacterial community. Our results indicated: 1) seasonal variation of the bacterial community composition was stronger than spatial variation due to the clearly seasonal variation of Microcystis, Synechococcus (picocyanobacteria) and other bacteria (Actinomycetales, Pirellulaceae and Sphingobacteriaceae); 2) the spatial distribution of the bacterial community showed that different phylawere dominant in different regions; 3) the bacterial co-occurrence networks varied seasonally andwere dominated byMicrocystis, ACK-M1, Chthoniobacteraceae, Synechococcus, Pirellulaceae and Pelagibacteraceae; 4) phytoplankton density, chlorophyll a, water temperature and total nitrogen were the major factors that drove the spatiotemporal variation of bacterial community composition. This study revealed the seasonal succession and spatial distribution of the entire bacterial community in Lake Taihu, providing newinsights into the relationship betweenwater bloom-forming cyanobacterial species and other bacteria, and their response to environmental factors in eutrophic freshwater ecosystem.

As natural CH4 emissions mainly originate from wet ecosystems, it is important to unravel how climate change may affect these emissions. This is especially true for ebullition (bubble flux from sediments), a pathway that has long been underestimated but generally dominates emissions. Here we show a remarkably strong relationship between CH4 ebullition and temperature across a wide range of freshwater ecosystems on different continents using multi-seasonal CH4 ebullition data from the literature. As these temperature-ebullition relationships may have been affected by seasonal variation in organic matter availability, we also conducted a controlled year-round mesocosm experiment. Here 4 degrees C warming led to 51% higher total annual CH4 ebullition, while diffusion was not affected. Our combined findings suggest that global warming will strongly enhance freshwater CH4 emissions through a disproportional increase in ebullition (6-20% per 1 degrees C increase), contributing to global warming.					; De Senerpont Domis, Lisette Nicole/C-2902-2008; Roelofs, Jan/C-1243-2011; Van de Waal, Dedmer/B-8002-2012; DelSontro, Tonya/N-4409-2017; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012; Velthuis, Mandy/J-2566-2013; Kazanjian, Garabet/B-3557-2018; Lamers, Leon/A-8718-2012; Frenken, Thijs/O-1617-2014; van Donk, Ellen/B-7272-2008; Kosten, Sarian/D-7550-2011; Peeters, Edwin/ABC-6307-2022; Domis, Lisette N. de/C-2902-2008; Barros, Nathan/D-5944-2013; Hilt, Sabine/IUQ-1586-2023	Aben, Ralf/0000-0002-6182-4789; De Senerpont Domis, Lisette Nicole/0000-0001-7509-9541; DelSontro, Tonya/0000-0002-1976-9181; Van de Waal, Dedmer/0000-0001-8803-1247; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X; Velthuis, Mandy/0000-0001-7295-651X; Kazanjian, Garabet/0000-0002-6507-0806; Frenken, Thijs/0000-0002-8989-2804; van Donk, Ellen/0000-0003-3279-4936; Barros, Nathan/0000-0003-1752-8621; Peeters, Edwin T.H.M./0000-0003-2541-1829													2041-1723					NOV 22	2017	8								1682	10.1038/s41467-017-01535-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-01535-y								29167452					WOS:000416226200011

Bayani; Schaefer, Kevin; Michaelides, Roger; Kling, George			Active layer freeze-thaw and water storage dynamics in permafrost environments inferred from InSAR	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												In cold regions where soils freeze and thaw annually, the ground surface deforms due to the density difference between groundwater and ground ice. Here we mapped thaw subsidence and frost heave signals over the Toolik Lake area on the North Slope of Alaska using 12 ALOS PALSAR Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) scenes (2006-2010). For the first time, we jointly analyzed InSAR observations with a large number of soil measurements collected within similar to 100 km of the Toolik Field Station. We found that the InSAR-observed deformation patterns are mainly related to soil water content and the seasonal active layer freeze-thaw (FT) cycle. We did not observe any substantial long-term subsidence trend outside the 2007 Anaktuvuk River Fire scar. This suggests that the magnitude of the maximum annual thaw subsidence did not change much outside the fire zone during the study period. The joint analysis of InSAR and field observations allows us to show that the amplitude of the seasonal thaw subsidence is proportional to the total amount of ice that has melted into liquid water at any given time. We note that topography influences the spatial distribution of soil water content, and the availability of soil water influences the type of vegetation that can grow. As a result, we found that the average seasonal thaw subsidence increases along a geomorphic-ecohydrologic transect with heath vegetation on the drier ridge-tops, tussock tundra on hillslopes, and sedge tundra at the wet lowland riparian zones. In addition, we detected a net uplift between late July and early September, mostly in the wetter riparian zone that experienced a larger seasonal thaw subsidence. Toolik Field Station in-situ records suggest that the air temperature fluctuated around or below freezing in early September during the ALOS PALSAR data acquisition times (at similar to 12 am local time). In this scenario, ice can be formed at the top of the soil, which leads to frost heave in saturated soils. Our results highlight how InSAR can improve our understanding of active layer freeze-thaw and water storage dynamics in permafrost environments.					; Chen, Jingyi/HSH-0573-2023; Cardenas, Meinhard/B-4940-2011	Michaelides, Roger/0000-0002-7577-6829; Wu, Yue/0000-0003-2714-7048; Chen, Jingyi/0000-0001-8493-6938; 													0034-4257	1879-0704				OCT	2020	248								112007	10.1016/j.rse.2020.112007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.112007													WOS:000568715700003

Despite the importance of CH4 ebullition in aquatic ecosystems, its magnitude and spatiotemporal variations in aquaculture ponds remain poorly understood. In this study, we determined the rates and spatiotemporal variations of ebullitive CH4 emissions from three mariculture ponds during the aquaculture period of two years at a subtropical estuary in southeast China. Our results showed that the mean ebullitive CH4 flux from the studied ponds was 14.9 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) during the aquaculture period and accounted for over 90% of the total CH4 emission, indicating the importance of ebullition as a major CH4 transport mechanism. Ebullitive CH4 emission demonstrated a clear seasonal pattern, with a peak value during the middle stage of aquaculture. Sediment temperature was found to be an important factor influencing the seasonal variations in CH4 ebullition. Ebullitive CH4 fluxes also exhibited considerable spatial variations within the ponds, with 49.7-71.8% of the whole pond CH4 ebullition being detected in the feeding zone where the large loading of sediment organic matter fueled CH4 production. Aquaculture ponds have much higher ebullitive CH4 effluxes than other aquatic ecosystems, which indicated the urgency to mitigate CH4 emission from aquaculture activities. Our findings highlighted that the importance of considering the large spatiotemporal variations in ebullitive CH4 flux in improving the accuracy of large-scale estimation of CH4 fluxes in aquatic ecosystems. Future studies should be conducted to characterize CH4 ebullitive fluxes over a greater number and diversity of aqua culture ponds and examine the mechanisms controlling CH4 ebullition in aquatic ecosystems.

In this work, a remote sensing algorithm was developed to estimate the concentrations of the total suspended sediments (TSS) in large lakes and reservoirs over the MLY basin and was based on a band ratio between 555 nm and 645 nm of the atmospherically corrected surface reflectance of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). In situ samples used to calibrate the algorithm were collected from 58 lakes and reservoirs with a TSS range of 1 to 300 mg L-1, and the uncertainty of this algorithm was 30-40%. The algorithm was subsequently applied to a total of 102 lakes and reservoirs located in the MLY basin to derive TSS maps from 2000 to 2014 at a 250 m spatial resolution, and the first comprehensive document of the TSS distributions and dynamics of large inland waters of the MLY basin was created. The seasonal patterns among the selected water bodies were similar, with the largest TSS concentrations occurring in the first and fourth quarters in a year and the lowest values occurring in the third quarter. In contrast, spatial heterogeneities were revealed by the 15-year long-term mean TSS climatology information. Although most lakes downstream of Poyang Lake were turbid with 15-year TSS climatology values of 45-100 mg L-1, waters between Poyang and Doting Lake were relatively clearer with TSS climatology values of 15-45 mg L-1, and the clearest waters (<15 mg L-1) were found in reservoirs. The turbidity of 64.5% (e.g., 49/76) for lakes in Class II exhibited a decreasing trend over the 15-year period, and the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) and Dongting Lake in Class I also showed significant TSS declines. Analysis with meteorological data shows that the intra-annual variations appear to be significantly correlated with local precipitation, with a time lag of two months for TSS. The prominent TSS decreasing trend of the lakes in Class,II was probably linked to the significant NDVI increase in the MLY basin, whereas the TSS decrease in the TGR and Dongting Lake is likely to be attributed to the impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam. The TSS environmental data record (EDR) of large inland waters presented in this study serves as an important reference for future water quality monitoring and evaluation in the MLY and in China.

There remains, however, a need to examine eDNA persistence in the wild through simultaneous temporal measures of eDNA and biota. Here, we use metabarcoding of two markers of different lengths, derived from an annual time series of aqueous lake eDNA to examine temporal shifts in ecosystem biodiversity and in an ecologically important group of macro-invertebrates (Diptera: Chironomidae). The analyses allow different levels of detection and validation of taxon richness and community composition (beta-diversity) through time, with shorter eDNA fragments dominating the eDNA community. Comparisons between eDNA, community DNA, taxonomy and UK species abundance data further show significant relationships between diversity estimates derived across the disparate methodologies. Our results reveal the temporal dynamics of eDNA and validate the utility of eDNA metabarcoding for tracking seasonal diversity at the ecosystem scale.

The impoundment of Three Gorges Dam (TGD) has influenced hydrological environment and land cover changes in the wetland. To quantify these influences, long-term land cover variations in the wetland were investigate by applying the Support Vector Machine method to Landsat satellite observations (1978-2018). We also try to explore the driving factors of vegetation changes by combining the classification results with measured hydrological and meteorological data. Some significant results have been revealed as follows: (1) In dry seasons, the most significant changes in Dongting Lake wetland were the vegetation expansion and the water area shrinkage, especially during the pre-TGD period (before 2003). Specifically, the vegetation area increased at a rate of 44.22 km(2)/a and the water decreased a a rate of 37.23 km(2)/a for the period of 1979-2001. But the variation trends of wetland cover types changed after 2003. The vegetation decreased at a rate of 24.36 km(2)/a and water increased a a rate of 20.05 km(2)/a from 2003 to 2017. (2) In we seasons, vegetation (1433.58 +/- 603.48 km(2)) and water area (2153.32 +/- 603.98 km(2)) fluctuated greatly in the pre-TGD period and the variation range narrowed significantly after 2003 (1632.62 +/- 234.39 km(2) of vegetation, 1958.5 +/- 235.04 km(2) of water). (3) Before 2003, the long-term change of vegetation area in dry seasons of the Dongting Lake wetland was strongly linear correlated with inundation area (r = -0.88, p < 0.05), sediment deposition (r = -0.84, p < 0.05) and mean temperature between July and September (r = 0.79, p < 0.05). But these relationships have changed after the operation of the TGD. In all, the variation in hydrological conditions caused by the impoundment of the TGD was likely the main reason for the variation of Dongting Lake wetland in recent decades.					; wang, boqiang/AAT-2097-2020	Yang, Liu/0009-0005-0001-3279; Yao, Rui/0000-0002-1578-8641													0022-1694	1879-2707				AUG	2020	587								124954	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124954	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124954													WOS:000568819100051

Declines in an abundant aquatic insect, the burrowing mayfly, across major North American waterways	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Seasonal animal movement among disparate habitats is a fundamental mechanism by which energy, nutrients, and biomass are transported across ecotones. A dramatic example of such exchange is the annual emergence of mayfly swarms from freshwater benthic habitats, but their characterization at macroscales has remained impossible. We analyzed radar observations of mayfly emergence flights to quantify long-term changes in annual biomass transport along the Upper Mississippi River and Western Lake Erie Basin. A single emergence event can produce 87.9 billion mayflies, releasing 3,078.6 tons of biomass into the airspace over several hours, but in recent years, production across both waterways has declined by over 50%. As a primary prey source in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, these declines will impact higher trophic levels and environmental nutrient cycling.					; Kelly, Jeffrey/B-2029-2015	Tank, Jennifer/0000-0001-9005-9548; Kelly, Jeffrey/0000-0002-8255-7990; Wainwright, Charlotte/0000-0002-9493-6285; Mirkovic, Djordje/0000-0002-6722-4100													0027-8424					FEB 11	2020	117	6					2987	2992		10.1073/pnas.1913598117	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1913598117								31964842					WOS:000513898000039

A total number of 82 pesticides were detected and the occurrence and the risk to human and fish were assessed. Most of pesticides with high frequency were medium or low toxic except for DDTs. DDTs were the significant contaminant and the widely used dicofol was the new source of DDTs. The spatial and seasonal variation of pesticide distribution was linked with the distribution of orchards and farmlands. Health risk from river water consumption was low (RQ < 0.1) while that from clam consumption was medium (RQ = 0.84). Pesticides in water posed great risk to fish and among the 76 water samples analyzed, 65 of them showed high risk (RQ > 1) and 6 showed medium risk (0.1 <= QR < 1). The single chemical posed high risk to fish included DDTs, triazophos, fenvalerate, bifenthrin and cyfluthrin, and those showed medium risk included dicofol, butachlor, isocarbophos, terbufos and cyhalothrin. There were 14 single pesticides detected with concentration above 100 ng L-1 in this study and the pesticide with the highest concentration was procymidone (3904 ng L-1). Further experiments illustrated that procymidone could disrupt the expression of vitellogenin in the estuarine fish even at environmental concentrations. DDTs, dicofol, triazophos, isocarbophos, terbufos, cyfluthrin, bifenthrin, fenvalerate, cyhalothrin, butachlor and procymidone have become the significant pesticides and should be considered in aquatic ecosystem risk management.

Following an actualistic approach, the ecology of extant relatives of the most abundant and diverse fossil groups recorded in the CKL (i.e., vascular plants, arthropods, fishes, and tetrapods) is considered. Data is based on an extensive literature review followed by a re-examination of recently collected fossils. This approach allowed a detailed appraisal of the stratigraphic/ecological distribution of the main fossil groups preserved in the CKL. Plant and animal groups are recorded in three main stratigraphic intervals, named Intervals I?III in ascending order. Most fossils are to be considered autochthonous to parautochthonous and have been preserved in distinct stages of base-level fluctuations within a shallow lacustrine depositional system, subject to periodic flooding in large, depressed areas. Exceptional preservation in such environments was mediated by microbially-induced processes (i.e., microbial mat entombment), mostly in the coastal areas of the alkaline lake. Based on the distinct sedimentary facies and autecological attributes of dominant paleobioindicators, a new paleoenvironmental model for the CKL is proposed, encompassing a seasonal, semi-arid, shallow lacustrine wetland. Faunal and floral content were ecologically arranged in long-lasting aquatic zones, surrounded by periodically flooded mesophytic ecotones and outer xeric habitats, as in the modern alkaline lake Chad in Africa. Our data show the relevance of multiproxy analyses (i.e., paleontological, sedimentological, geochemical, and stratigraphic) of exceptional fossil sites for assessing paleoenvironmental conditions in depositional settings subject to continuous base-level changes, such as those existing in complex, present-day wetland ecosystems. The recognition of key parameters in ancient wetlands is of great importance concerning the formation of non-marine Konservat-Lagersta?tten in the geological record.

Despite the advances in understanding the role of external loadings, the contribution of internal nutrient cycling is still an open question. A dynamic mass-balance model was developed to simulate and measure the contributions of internal cycling and external loading. It was based on the temporal Bayesian Hierarchical Framework (BHM), where we explored the seasonal patterns in the dynamics of nutrient cycling processes and the limitation of N and P on phytoplankton growth in hyper-eutrophic Lake Dianchi, China. The dynamic patterns of the five state variables (Chla, TP, ammonia, nitrate and organic N) were simulated based on the model. Five parameters (algae growth rate, sediment exchange rate of N and P, nitrification rate and denitrification rate) were estimated based on BHM. The model provided a good fit to observations. Our model results highlighted the role of internal cycling of N and P in Lake Dianchi. The internal cycling processes contributed more than external loading to the N and P changes in the water column. Further insights into the nutrient limitation analysis indicated that the sediment exchange of P determined the P limitation. Allowing for the contribution of denitrification to N removal, N was the more limiting nutrient in most of the time, however, P was the more important nutrient for eutrophication management. For Lake Dianchi, it would not be possible to recover solely by reducing the external watershed nutrient load; the mechanisms of internal cycling should also be considered as an approach to inhibit the release of sediments and to enhance denitrification.

Justin			Seeing the rainbow: mechanisms underlying spectral sensitivity in teleost fishes	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												Among vertebrates, teleost eye diversity exceeds that found in all other groups. Their spectral sensitivities range from ultraviolet to red, and the number of visual pigments varies from 1 to over 40. This variation is correlated with the different ecologies and life histories of fish species, including their variable aquatic habitats: murky lakes, clear oceans, deep seas and turbulent rivers. These ecotopes often change with the season, but fish may also migrate between ecotopes diurnally, seasonally or ontogenetically. To survive in these variable light habitats, fish visual systems have evolved a suite of mechanisms that modulate spectral sensitivities on a range of timescales. These mechanisms include: (1) optical media that filter light, (2) variations in photoreceptor type and size to vary absorbance and sensitivity, and (3) changes in photoreceptor visual pigments to optimize peak sensitivity. The visual pigment changes can result from changes in chromophore or changes to the opsin. Opsin variation results from changes in opsin sequence, opsin expression or co-expression, and opsin gene duplications and losses. Here, we review visual diversity in a number of teleost groups where the structural and molecular mechanisms underlying their spectral sensitivities have been relatively well determined. Although we document considerable variability, this alone does not imply functional difference per se. We therefore highlight the need for more studies that examine species with known sensitivity differences, emphasizing behavioral experiments to test whether such differences actually matter in the execution of visual tasks that are relevant to the fish.					; Cortesi, Fabio/A-5688-2017; Stieb, Sara/K-7916-2015; Cheney, Karen/A-6827-2013	Sueess (formerly Stieb), Sara/0000-0001-7158-3934; Cortesi, Fabio/0000-0002-7518-6159; Carleton, Karen/0000-0001-6306-5643; Marshall, Justin/0000-0001-9006-6713													0022-0949	1477-9145				APR	2020	223	8							jeb193334	10.1242/jeb.193334	http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.193334								32327561					WOS:000541835800001

However, how eutrophication and warming change lakes' carbon cycle has not been determined. Here, the surface partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and CO2 flux in Lake Taihu, a large and eutrophic lake in eastern China, was investigated based on monthly samplings over a 24-yr period (1992-2015), during which the lake experienced profound anthropogenic and climate changes. The results showed that eutrophication caused by nutrient enrichment plays a role in three aspects: (1) nutrient concentrations controlled the CO2 variability on decadal scales; (2) peak pCO(2) and CO2 fluxes occurred in river mouths due to large external nutrient loading inputs; and (3) eutrophication effects on CO2 varied among subzones, which was linked to external inputs and in-lake primary production. Meanwhile, temperature controls the seasonal variation in CO2 by stimulating primary production, leading to significantly lower pCO(2) and CO2 fluxes in warm seasons with algal blooms. Further analysis suggested that temperature effects varied spatially and temporally, high nutrient loading may confound the temperature effects via stimulating CO2 production. To our knowledge, this study presents the longest field measurements (24 yr) of CO2 from such large and ice-free freshwater lakes with monthly surveys, which may provide a powerful example to demonstrate that eutrophication and warming can shape CO2 variability from a temporal perspective. Future studies should focus on the interactive warming and eutrophication effects to accurately predict future CO2 emission.

To this end, a better understanding of the processes controlling the metal tonnage of porphyry Cu deposits, the main source of Cu, is needed and the focus of current research and debate. This study provides a comprehensive view of the duration of upper-crustal magmatism and its significance in the degree of metal endowment in porphyry Cu deposits using the Yerington batholith, Nevada, USA, as a case study. The Yerington district constitutes an exceptional example of an exposed porphyry Cu system where the plutonic environment that fed the porphyritic dikes is accessible. Combining trace element geochemistry and high-precision geochronology of zircon from all exposed units, we propose that the thermal maturation of the upper crust by a continuum in magmatic activity without significant hiatuses is a key factor in enabling the formation of large porphyry Cu style mineralization. The Yerington magmatic system transitioned from a volcanically active environment with coeval plutonism to a growing upper-crustal magmatic reservoir that fed the porphyritic dikes and associated mineralized centers to then resume its volcanic activity terminating the ore-forming episode. A relatively high volcanic/plutonic ratio characterized the first expressions of Jurassic magmatism in the district from similar to 170 Ma with the coeval eruption of the Artesia Lake volcanics and the protracted emplacement of the McLeod Hill pluton. Geochemically, this period recorded distinctive negative Eu anomalies and a gentle increase in Yb/Dy ratios in zircon with decreasing Ti contents over a large range of zircon crystallization temperatures. This persistent magmatism over similar to 2 Myr thermally matured the upper crust, enabling the growth of magmatic reservoirs that formed the Bear and Luhr Hill plutons without known volcanic activity for similar to 1.3 Myr. Zircon trace element compositions indicate that this transition occurred as a continuum in decreasing negative Eu anomalies and increasing Yb/Dy with decreasing Ti contents and age across the plutonic units, reaching the more evolved signatures and lowest crystallization temperatures in the zircon from porphyry dikes. An increase in the volcanic/plutonic ratio with the eruption of the Fulstone Spring sequence likely terminated the ore-forming potential of the district. Although many other studies have provided important views on the timing and duration of porphyry Cu deposit formation, the link to their plutonic roots has been limited due to their inaccessibility. Therefore, this study offers the first complete picture into the temporal and chemical evolution of an upper-crustal magmatic system and the roles that factors like prolonged magmatism and volcanism play before and after ore formation. We argue that without the thermal maturation of the upper crust, the construction of a long-lived magmatic reservoir would not have been possible, precluding the formation of porphyry Cu deposits. Under this premise, not only the duration of ore-related magmatic activity, but the occurrence of long-lived precursor magmatism might exercise crucial control on the final tonnage of the deposit and should be considered during exploration for new porphyry deposits.

Intercomparison and application of model products	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Results are presented from the second phase of the multiinstitution North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2) research partnership. In NLDAS, the Noah, Variable Infiltration Capacity, Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting, and Mosaic land surface models (LSMs) are executed over the conterminous U.S. (CONUS) in realtime and retrospective modes. These runs support the drought analysis, monitoring and forecasting activities of the National Integrated Drought Information System, as well as efforts to monitor large-scale floods. NLDAS-2 builds upon the framework of the first phase of NLDAS (NLDAS-1) by increasing the accuracy and consistency of the surface forcing data, upgrading the land surface model code and parameters, and extending the study from a 3-year (1997-1999) to a 30-year (1979-2008) time window. As the first of two parts, this paper details the configuration of NLDAS-2, describes the upgrades to the forcing, parameters, and code of the four LSMs, and explores overall model-to-model comparisons of land surface water and energy flux and state variables over the CONUS. Focusing on model output rather than on observations, this study seeks to highlight the similarities and differences between models, and to assess changes in output from that seen in NLDAS-1. The second part of the two-part article focuses on the validation of model-simulated streamflow and evaporation against observations. The results depict a higher level of agreement among the four models over much of the CONUS than was found in the first phase of NLDAS. This is due, in part, to recent improvements in the parameters, code, and forcing of the NLDAS-2 LSMs that were initiated following NLDAS-1. However, large inter-model differences still exist in the northeast, Lake Superior, and western mountainous regions of the CONUS, which are associated with cold season processes. In addition, variations in the representation of sub-surface hydrology in the four LSMs lead to large differences in modeled evaporation and subsurface runoff. These issues are important targets for future research by the land surface modeling community. Finally, improvement from NLDAS-1 to NLDAS-2 is summarized by comparing the streamflow measured from U. S. Geological Survey stream gauges with that simulated by four NLDAS models over 961 small basins.					; wei, he/KCY-2550-2024; Duan, Qingyun/C-7652-2011; lettenmaier, dennis/F-8780-2011; Mocko, David/LIC-3464-2024; Sheffield, Justin/A-6388-2008; Livneh, Ben/I-2939-2015; Luo, Lifeng/C-8734-2009	LIVNEH, BEN/0000-0001-5445-2473; Duan, Qingyun/0000-0001-9955-1512; Sheffield, Justin/0000-0003-2400-0630; Mocko, David/0000-0001-8688-5708; Luo, Lifeng/0000-0002-2829-7104; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				FEB 3	2012	117								D03109	10.1029/2011JD016048	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2011JD016048													WOS:000299960500001

The constancy of life produced change with sociological significance from visual expression to evaluation of value since the intervene of new elements. It has been through the reconstruction of historical language from the natural order of villages to compulsory intervention of icon, whereas the reconstruction does not mean put in stiffly. The realistic question is that through set up icon and indicator system having a negative effect on ancient village environment. It is difficult to fusion between modernization of symbols and obsolete architecture. Village unit is a unified symbol from the vision system to daily life. It is the symbiotic design that is contributed to guide the environment and icon design system. Symbiosis represents effective stacking and crossover influences between multi-elements and which reasonably demonstrate on the hierarchy of visual order. On the basis of understanding and analyzing the using status of icon and indicator system in ancient villages, probing the relationship between ancient village environment and icon design and design problems that spring from it. Ancient villages in paper mainly refer to two ancient villages around the Taihu Lake named Dongcun and Mingyuewan village. The designation of geographical scope is the precondition for research. Natural conditions and architecture style is very important for icon design. The local environment of traditional village is facing constant change of morerniazation, which becoming a sustainable problem for the development of ancient villages and cultural continuity problems. Intervention form that impose icon system to the ancient villages is the core of this thesis. Through the effectiveness that the status quo of a village's icon system and the quantization of icon system have on the guidelines routes, the author sums up three icon design models for the ancient environment. Using sociological and psychological methods to test systematic derivative ideas of icon design, which is beneficial for transforming the research achievements of cases to guide the theoretical development of subjects. In the icon design which is based on semiology as its theoretical basis, the application of icon design is constantly expanding from public places in cities to non-commercial environment, which put forward more requirements for the principle and theory of icon design. The integral family pattern of ancient villages is a premise of the design. With the diversity of observation styles, the visually-oriented system of ancient villages is still simple and lack of integrity. With the embedded development of design industry, what icon system can do to help the protection of traditional heritage worthy of attention. It is difficult to cope effectively with the combination of traditional environment and modern icon system, then, the reason for this is that the difference between design and the main body has not been fully considered. When the design method that suitable for environment introduced to the other environment with different attributes, the purpose and identification of the icon are accordingly changed which refers to changes in the symbolism. The design principles in public environment aim to meet the purpose of business promotion and guide. The theoretical model of semiology plays the role of stimulating when successfully translated during the process of asking the direction. The purpose of the article is dealing with coordination and common design principles of modernization and tradition.

The correlation between the Methylation Index of brGDGTs (the MBT5ME paleothermometer) and temperature offers an important tool for reconstructing past terrestrial temperatures. However, factors other than temperature could also affect the distribution of brGDGTs in lacustrine systems, hampering the quantitative application of this paleothermometer. Here we investigated brGDGT distributions in contemporary sediments collected from 52 lakes in mid-latitude Asia. Combined with published brGDGT data from other lakes across the globe, we have found a strong salinity control on the relative abundance of 5-methyl brGDGTs versus their late-eluting isomers (including 6-methyl, 7-methyl, and unknown isomers). This allows the development of novel indices based on the isomerization of brGDGTs for tracing past lake water salinity. We also demonstrate , that salinity-controlled isomerization of pentamethylated and hexamethylated brGDGTs can significantly impact the MBT5ME paleothermometer, , potentially leading to an overestimation of past temperature, but the temperature signal can be extracted out of the MBT5ME index after correcting the salinity effect. As demonstrated in application to a Lake Qinghai (China) sediment core spanning the last 18 kyr, our finding could facilitate the simultaneous retrieval of reliable temperature and salinity records using brGDGTs in lacustrine settings, in particular for lakes that have experienced large salinity changes during the geological past.

Study focus: This study investigated the spatio-temporal patterns or trends and spatial distribution and variability of rainfall in seasonal and annual time-series. The rainfall variability was evaluated by the coefficient of variation (CV), precipitation concentration index (PCI), and standardized anomaly index (SAI). The spatio-temporal trends were also analyzed using the Mann-Kendall test (MK), Sen's slope estimators (SSE), and the latest technique of innovative trend analysis (ITA) method was used for analyzing the low, medium and high rainfall clusters. New hydrological insight for the region: In most of the rainfall stations, high amount of annual rainfall happened in the Kiremt (wet) season, and high rainfall variability was during the Bega (dry) season. During the annual rainfall, the MK test and SSE were statistically non-significant in some stations, and heavy rainfall was detected in the Kiremt and Belg (transition) seasons. For the Kiremt and annual period, most rainfall stations showed high rainfall cluster and increasing trends, while low rainfall was observed in Bega season which exhibited decreasing trends. The outcomes of comparison revealed that the ITA method is more robust and surpassed the MK test as it could detect monotonic and non-monotonic trends that cannot be observed by the MK method. The result of this study is helpful for water resources planning and management in UWSRB.

However, which spatial scale (riparian zone versus sub-basin) has the greater impact on water quality has long been controversial, since the key metrics that affect water quality varied with spatial scale. Thus, quantifying the spatial scale effects of key landscape metrics on water quality is critical to clarifying which scale of landscape pattern is more conducive to water quality conservation. Here, we adopted variation partitioning analysis (VPA) and random forest models to quantify the landscape pattern impact on water quality at northern Erhai Lake during the 2019 rainy season (early, mid, and late), and comprehensively analyze the key landscape metrics on different scales. The results revealed that the riparian zone and sub-basin scale landscape patterns explained similar water quality variations (difference only 0.9%) in the mid (August) and late rainy season (October), but exhibited a large difference (24.1%) during the early rainy season (June). Furthermore, rivers were primarily stressed by nitrogen pollution. Maintaining the Grassland_ED 27.99 m/ha, Grassland_LPI > 4.19%, Farm-land_LSI < 3.2 in the riparian zone, and Construction_ED < 1.69 m/ha, Construction_LSI < 2.46, Farm-land_PLADJ < 89.0% at the sub-basin scale could significantly reduce the TN concentration in the stream. Meanwhile, managing of these metrics can effectively prevent rapid increases of TN in rivers. Moreover, due to the low phosphorus concentration in the rivers, none of the landscape metrics significantly explained the vari-ation in TP.

The river flow, although remains relatively unregulated, is expected to be increasingly perturbed by climate change and rapidly accelerating socioeconomic developments. Current understanding about hydrological changes under the combined impacts of these drivers, however, remains limited. This study presents projected hydrological changes caused by multiple drivers, namely climate change, large-scale hydropower developments, and irrigated land expansions by 2050s. We found that the future flow regime is highly susceptible to all considered drivers, shown by substantial changes in both annual and seasonal flow distribution. While hydropower developments exhibit limited impacts on annual total flows, climate change and irrigation expansions cause changes of +15% and -3% in annual flows, respectively. However, hydropower developments show the largest seasonal impacts characterized by higher dry season flows (up to +70%) and lower wet season flows (-15%). These strong seasonal impacts tend to outplay those of the other drivers, resulting in the overall hydrological change pattern of strong increases of the dry season flow (up to + 160%); flow reduction in the first half of the wet season (up to -25%); and slight flow increase in the second half of the wet season (up to 40%). Furthermore, the cumulative impacts of all drivers cause substantial flow reductions during the early wet season (up to -25% in July), posing challenges for crop production and saltwater intrusion in the downstream Mekong Delta. Substantial flow changes and their consequences require careful considerations of future development activities, as well as timely adaptation to future changes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

M.			Mobilization of aged and biolabile soil carbon by tropical deforestation	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												In the mostly pristine Congo Basin, agricultural land-use change has intensified in recent years. One potential and understudied consequence of this deforestation and conversion to agriculture is the mobilization and loss of organic matter from soils to rivers as dissolved organic matter. Here, we quantify and characterize dissolved organic matter sampled from 19 catchments of varying deforestation extent near Lake Kivu over a two-week period during the wet season. Dissolved organic carbon from deforested, agriculturally dominated catchments was older (C-14 age: similar to 1.5 kyr) and more biolabile than from pristine forest catchments. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry revealed that this aged organic matter from deforested catchments was energy rich and chemodiverse, with higher proportions of nitrogen- and sulfur-containing formulae. Given the molecular composition and biolability, we suggest that organic matter from deforested landscapes is preferentially respired upon disturbance, resulting in elevated in-stream concentrations of carbon dioxide. We estimate that while deforestation reduces the overall flux of dissolved organic carbon by approximately 56%, it does not significantly change the yield of biolabile dissolved organic carbon. Ultimately, the exposure of deeper soil horizons through deforestation and agricultural expansion releases old, previously stable, and biolabile soil organic carbon into the modern carbon cycle via the aquatic pathway.					; Trumbore, Susan/B-1948-2013; Drake, Travis/GSN-8620-2022; Podgorski, David/A-5532-2010; Spencer, Robert/ADE-1993-2022; six, johan/J-5228-2015; Boeckx, Pascal/J-3668-2013; Hoyt, Alison/AAF-1085-2020; Van Oost, Kristof/B-6941-2008	Drake, Travis/0000-0002-7564-974X; Van Oost, Kristof/0000-0002-4938-9438; six, johan/0000-0001-9336-4185; Hoyt, Alison/0000-0003-0813-5084; Podgorski, David/0000-0002-1070-5923; Boeckx, Pascal/0000-0003-3998-0010; Bauters, Marijn/0000-0003-0978-6639; 													1752-0894	1752-0908				JUL	2019	12	7					541	+		10.1038/s41561-019-0384-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41561-019-0384-9								31338120					WOS:000473104300011

As global climate warming continues, it is anticipated that the composition of DOM in lakes will be altered. This could have significant ecological and environmental implications, particularly in frozen ground zones. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the spatial variations and molecular composition of DOM in lakes within various frozen ground zones. In this study, we examined the spatial variations of in -lake DOM both quantitatively, focusing on dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and qualitatively, by evaluating optical properties and conducting molecular characterization using Fourier -transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). Lakes in cold regions retained more organic carbon compared to those in warmer regions, the comparison of the mean value of DOC concentration of all sampling sites in the same frozen ground zone showed that the highest mean lake DOC concentration found in the permafrost zone at 21.4 +/- 19.3 mg/L. We observed decreasing trends in E2:E3 and MLBL, along with increasing trends in SUVA254 and AImod, along the gradually warming ground. These trends suggest lower molecular weight, reduced aromaticity, and increased molecular lability of in -lake DOM in the permafrost zone compared to other frozen ground zones. Further FT-ICR MS characterization revealed significant molecular -level heterogeneity of DOM, with the lowest abundance of assigned DOM molecular formulas found in lakes within permafrost zones. In all studied zones, the predominant molecular formulas in -lake DOM were compounds consisted by CHO elements, accounting for 40.1 % to 63.1 % of the total. Interestingly, the percentage of CHO exhibited a gradual decline along the warming ground, while there was an increasing trend in nitrogen -containing compounds (CHON%). Meanwhile, a substantial number of polyphenols were identified, likely due to the higher rates of DOM mineralization and the transport of terrestrial DOM derived from vascular plants under the elevated temperature and precipitation conditions in the warming region. In addition, sulfur -containing compounds (CHOS and CHNOS) associated with synthetic surfactants and agal derivatives were consistently detected, and their relative abundances exhibited higher values in seasonal and short -frozen ground zones. This aligns with the increased anthropogenic disturbances to the lake's ecological environment in these two zones. This study reported the first description of in -lake DOM at the molecular level in different frozen ground zones. These findings underline that lakes in the permafrost zone serve as significant hubs for carbon processing. Investigating them may expand our understanding of carbon cycling in inland waters.

Because of the scarcity of data, published lake evaporation values are inconsistent, and their spatial distribution has never been reported. Presenting a plausible hypothesis of energy balance during the ice-free seasons, we explored the multiyear (2003-2016) average ice phenology and evaporation amounts of 75 large dimictic lakes by using a combination of meteorological and satellite data. Evaporation amounts show large variability in spatial distribution, with a pattern of higher values in the south. Lakes with higher elevation, smaller area, and higher latitude are generally associated with a shorter ice-free season and lower evaporation. The total evaporated water amounts have values of approximately 29.4 +/- 1.2 km(3) year(-1) for the 75 studied lakes and 51.7 +/- 2.1 km(3) year(-1) for all plateau lakes included.

Fertilizer deep placement, especially urea deep placement (UDP), has been widely recognized as an efficient way to increase rice yield with less N use in flooded rice fields; however, few studies have explored UDP as a way to abate N loss, particularly ammonia (NH3) volatilization, in intensive rice cropping systems. Therefore, a field experiment was performed in the Taihu Region with five treatments (two surface split broadcasting treatments: a current traditional practice with 300 kg N ha(-1) (CT) and a reduced N practice with 225 kg N ha(-1) (RN), two one-time UDP treatments: a current traditional practice under UDP (CTDP) and a reduced N practice under UDP (RNDP), and a CK treatment with no urea). The NH3 volatilization, grain yield and N use efficiency in terms of the N recovery efficiency (NRE) were investigated during the 2014-2016 rice growing seasons. Additionally, N diffusion and N-15-labeled urea experiments were conducted to explore the N release pattern and the fate of N-15 under UDP. The results demonstrated that little NH4+-N could diffuse into surface water under UDP, thus, negligible floodwater NH4+-N was detected. The seasonally cumulative NH3 volatilization of the UDP accounted for only 1% of the total applied N, which decreased by 91% compared to surface broadcasting treatments. As a result, the NH3 intensity (NH3-N loss per crop yield) was reduced by 92% over surface broadcasting. Moreover, the deep placement of urea could supply a higher NH4+-N concentration in the soil during the early growth stage and prolong the duration of N availability for 2 months; as a result, UDP remarkably increased the N uptake by 28% compared with surface broadcasting treatments in the 3 years. The UDP treatments significantly increased the yield and NRE by 10% and 55% under favorable weather conditions (2015 and 2016 rice seasons), respectively. The RNDP treatment obtained the lowest N surplus (36 kg N ha(-1)), and the plant N-15 uptake was 62% higher and the N-15 loss was 38% lower with RNDP than surface broadcasting. Therefore, the deep placement of urea can be considered a slow release fertilizer, which better matches the N demand of rice plants and effectively minimizes N losses, especially NH3 volatilization. The RNDP treatment, with a 25% reduction in the N dose, can represent an effective and promising strategy to achieve environmental integrity and food security in intensive rice cropping systems.					zhang, min/IYI-9869-2023; Tian, Tian Yuhua/GPX-9558-2022; YIN, BINYAN/HLH-2170-2023; Zhao, Meng/I-5306-2019	Bowen, Zhang/0000-0002-3565-8297													0378-4290	1872-6852				APR 1	2018	218						254	266		10.1016/j.fcr.2017.03.013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2017.03.013													WOS:000427208600025
C	Yousef, SM		ElNadi, L		Yousef, SM			Deciphering the fall and rise of the dead sea in relation to solar forcing	Modern Trends in Physics Research	AIP CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS				1st International Conference on Modern Trends in Physics Research	APR 04-09, 2004	Cairo Univ, Dept, Fac Sci, Cairo, EGYPT	Minist State Higher Educ & Sci Res, Acad Sci Res, Atom Energy Author	Cairo Univ, Dept, Fac Sci			Solar Forcing on closed seas and Lakes is space time dependent. The Cipher of the Dead Sea level variation since 1200 BC is solved in the context of millenium and Wolf-Gleissberg solar cycles time scales. It is found that the pattern of Dead Sea level variation follows the pattern of major millenium solar cycles. The 70 m rise of Dead Sea around 1AD is due to the forcing of the maximum millenium major solar cycle. Although the pattern of the Dead Sea level variation is almost identical to major solar cycles pattern between 1100 and 1980 AD, there is a dating problem of the Dead Sea time series around 1100-1300 AD that time. A discrepancy that should be corrected for the solar and Dead Sea series to fit. Detailed level variations of the Dead Sea level for the past 200 years are solved in terms of the 80-120 years solar Wolf-Gliessberg magnetic cycles. Solar induced climate changes do happen at the turning points of those cycles. Those endstart and maximum turning points are coincident with the change in the solar rotation rate due to the presence of weak solar cycles. Such weak cycles occur in series of few cycles between the end and start of those Wolf-Gleissberg cycles. Another one or two weak r solar cycle occur following the maximum of those Wolf-Gleissberg cycles. Weak cycles induce drop in the energy budget emitted from the sun and reaching the Earth thus causing solar induced climate change. An 8 meter sudden rise of Dead Sea occur prior 1900 AD due to positive solar forcing of the second cycle of the weak cycles series on the Dead Sea. The same second weak cycle induced negative solar forcing on Lake Chad. The first weak solar cycle forced Lake Victoria to rise abruptly in 1878. The maximum turning point of the solar WolfGleissberg cycle induced negative forcing on both the Aral Sea and the Dead Sea causing their shrinkage to an alarming reduced area ever since. On the other hand, few years delayed positive forcing caused Lake Chad and the Equatorial African lakes to rise abruptly by several meters. Since the present solar cycle number 23 is the first weak cycle of a series, and since it caused 1.6 m sharp rise in Lake Victoria in 1997, then there is a high probability that the Dead Sea will rise by the beginning of the second weak cycle in few years time. And since both the Aral Sea and the Dead Sea are very much in coherence since the late 1950s, then it is rather likely that the Aral Sea will rise with God's wish in the near future. However it is also demanded that Israel should allow more water of the Jordan River to feed the Dead Sea before its real death. Plans for joining the Dead sea to the Red and or to the Mediterranean Seas should be cancelled owing the damaging harm it will cause the Dead Sea as a perfect indicator of solar induced climate change on one hand. On the other hand, the Dead Sea time series always show abrupt changes that can be as high as 70 m; if we add to this a planned artificial rise of the Dead Sea to its level of the thirties, then a damaging flooding effect will ruin the establishments and environment greatly.																			0094-243X		0-7354-0233-7				2005	748						441	449																WOS:000228894200050
J	Zhe, M; Zhang, XQ				Zhe, Meng; Zhang, Xueqin			Time-lag effects of NDVI responses to climate change in the Yamzhog Yumco Basin, South Tibet	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Vegetation dynamics and their response to climate change is critical for determining the mechanisms of climate derived variations in terrestrial ecosystems. Here, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and monthly temperature and precipitation data were employed to examine the spatiotemporal patterns in vegetation dynamics and investigate the time-lag effects of vegetation responses to climate variables in the Yamzhog Yumco Basin, South Tibet, during 2000-2018. The results reveal that the annual average growing season NDVI in the basin was 0.28, with lower values in the mountainous regions and higher values broadly distributed in the lake and river zones. An increasing NDVI trend was observed in nearly 62% of the total vegetation area, with significant changes observed in the western and southern boundaries of the basin. The vegetation areas in the eastern part of basin exhibited a decreasing NDVI trend. The growing season NDVI was positively correlated with temperature and precipitation, with temperature being the primary driving factor for vegetation growth across the entire basin. The cumulative temperature and precipitation of the current and previous months had the strongest impact on NDVI variations. The correlation coefficients between the NDVI, and temperature and precipitation were greater than 0.6 in approximately 72% and 60% of the vegetation area, respectively, with Lag 0-1 accounting for most of these larger correlation coefficients. Future development targets for grassland conservation projects, such as the reasonable livestock capacity, should consider the time-lag effects on vegetation dynamics.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				MAY	2021	124								107431	10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107431	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107431		JAN 2021											WOS:000624338900004

We use variability along the salinity gradient of San Francisco Bay to illustrate some lessons about the diversity of spatial structures in estuaries and their variability over time. Spatial patterns of dissolved constituents (e.g., silicate) can be linear or nonlinear, depending on the relative importance of river-ocean mixing and internal sinks (diatom uptake). Particles have different spatial patterns because they accumulate in estuarine turbidity maxima formed by the combination of sinking and estuarine circulation. Some constituents have weak or no mean spatial structure along the salinity gradient, reflecting spatially distributed sources along the estuary (nitrate) or atmospheric exchanges that buffer spatial variability of ecosystem metabolism (dissolved oxygen). The density difference between freshwater and seawater establishes stratification in estuaries stronger than the thermal stratification of lakes and oceans. Stratification is strongest around the center of the salinity gradient and when river discharge is high. Spatial distributions of motile organisms are shaped by species-specific adaptations to different salinity ranges (shrimp) and by behavioral responses to environmental variability (northern anchovy). Estuarine spatial patterns change over time scales of events (intrusions of upwelled ocean water), seasons (river inflow), years (annual weather anomalies), and between eras separated by ecosystem disturbances (a species introduction). Each of these lessons is a piece in the puzzle of how estuarine ecosystems are structured and how they differ from the river and ocean ecosystems they bridge.					; Cloern, James/C-1499-2011	Martin, Charles/0000-0003-3576-2585; Nejad, Erica/0000-0001-8204-6368													0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2017	62			1			S272	S291		10.1002/lno.10537	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10537													WOS:000415924700019
J	Sen, G; Yakupoglu, T				Sen, Gul; Yakupoglu, Turker			Grain Size Distribution and Depositional Environment of Quaternary Sediments in Moralli Stream System (Tusba, Van, Turkey)	TURKIYE JEOLOJI BULTENI-GEOLOGICAL BULLETIN OF TURKEY												This study aimed to determine the grain size distribution trend of the Quaternary aged fluvio-lacustrine sediments of the Moralli Stream system, which is located within the borders of Van province to the east of Lake Van, and to reveal the effects of hydrodynamic energy on the erosion, transportation and depositional processes. Moreover, it aimed to define the sedimentary facies and geomorphological characteristics of the depositional environment. In order to determine the grain size distribution trends of the sediments, a grain size analysis was carried out by using a total of 42 sediment samples taken from the source area of the Moralli Stream in the area where it spills into Lake Van. It was determined that the grain size of the sediments taken from the stream source area was dominantly between 0.42-0.25 mm, and the grain size of the sediments taken from the downstream parts of the channel bed was between 0.125-0.037 mm. The mean grain size of the fluvial sediments is fine-very fine, the sorting parameter is generally in the poorly sorted class, the skewness degree is strongly negatively skewed, and the degree of kurtosis was determined as platykurtic. The grain size of the sediment samples taken from the delta plain is 4.75-025 mm, the grain size of the sediment samples taken from the delta channels is 1.00-0.25 mm, and the grain size of sediment samples taken from the delta front ranged between 0.074-0.037 mm. The delta plain sediments is a coarse sand with poor sorting, positively skewed and mesokurtic, the delta channel sediments is medium-fine sand with poor sorting, positively skewed and platykurtic, and the delta front sediments is very fine sand with moderate sorting, negatively skewed and leptokurtic. The grain size of the beach sediments was determined in the range of 1-0.42 mm. While sediments contained fine grains of 0.074-a037 mm in size in the coastal area, especially in the low-energy foreshore area, it was determined that sediments containing >4.75 mm in size pebbles were deposited in the rip channel and shore break areas. The mean grain size of the beach sediments of Lake Van is very coarse sand and coarse-medium sand size, and is represented with moderate, moderate-well sorting, symmetric-positive skewness and leptokurtic parameters. With the grain size and statistical parameter data obtained as a result of the sedimentological analyses carried out within the scope of this study, the hydrodynamic energy of Moralli Stream has the potential to carry sandsilt-clay size grains, and the wave energy of Lake Van has the potential to transport gravel and sand-size grains. Moreover, it was found that the sediment's grain size decreased downstream in the drainage basin. In addition, the facies of sediments deposited in fluvial, delta and lacustrine environments formed by the rise and fall of the water level of Lake Tim due to climatic changes were defined and geomorphological structures (coastal arrows, coastal spits, beach barriers, lake and river terraces) emerging from tectonic and hydrodynamic activity were determined.

However, the construction of dams greatly impacts downstream ecological environments and nearby marine areas. The present manuscript presents a comprehensive review of the influence of human activities on the environment, especially the effect of dam construction on the ecosystems of river estuaries and nearby marine areas, so as to provide a scientific basis for ecological environment protection. To summarize these impacts, this review used recent studies to comprehensively analyze how dam construction has affected river hydrology, geomorphology, and downstream ecosystems globally. Effects of dams on ecosystems occur through reduced river flow, reduced sediment flux, altered water temperature, changed estuary delta, altered composition and distribution of nutrients, altered structure and distribution of phytoplankton populations, habitat fragmentation, and blocked migration routes in river sections and adjacent seas. Effects of dam construction (especially the Three Gorges Dam) on the Yangtze River were also reviewed. Performing community and mitigation planning before dam construction, exploring new reservoir management strategies (including targeted control of dam storage and flushing sediment operations), banning fishing activities, and removing unnecessary dams (obsolete or small dams) are becoming crucial tools for ecosystem restoration.

Iestyn; Liu, Gang			Earlier ice loss accelerates lake warming in the Northern Hemisphere	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												How lake temperatures are responding to widespread changes in lake ice remains unclear. Here the authors show the excess lake warming during the ice-off and ice-on month due to earlier ice loss and later ice formation across the Northern Hemisphere. How lake temperatures across large geographic regions are responding to widespread alterations in ice phenology (i.e., the timing of seasonal ice formation and loss) remains unclear. Here, we analyse satellite data and global-scale simulations to investigate the contribution of long-term variations in the seasonality of lake ice to surface water temperature trends across the Northern Hemisphere. Our analysis suggests a widespread excess lake surface warming during the months of ice-off which is, on average, 1.4 times that calculated during the open-water season. This excess warming is influenced predominantly by an 8-day advancement in the average timing of ice break-up from 1979 to 2020. Until the permanent loss of lake ice in the future, excess lake warming may be further amplified due to projected future alterations in lake ice phenology. Excess lake warming will likely alter within-lake physical and biogeochemical processes with numerous implications for lake ecosystems.

Whether correlations with temperature and pH emerge due to a physiological response of source organisms and/or a shift in bacterial community composition remains an open question with important implications for proxy development and application. We applied a newly described technique for grouping brGDGTs to a globally compiled dataset (n = 3129) consisting of all modern sample media known to host brGDGTs. We found strong resemblances in the relationships between brGDGT fractional abundances and both temperature and pH across nearly all sample types examined. We also found near-universal connections between the brGDGTs themselves. Given the markedly different bacterial communities expected to inhabit these settings, these widespread relationships may suggest physiological and/or biochemical bases for observed brGDGT distributions.					; Geirsdóttir, Áslaug/L-3267-2015; Geirsdottir, Aslaug/L-3267-2015; Sepulveda, Julio/K-6268-2017; Sepúlveda, Julio/AAC-9956-2020	Miller, G H/0000-0002-8225-2740; Geirsdottir, Aslaug/0000-0003-3125-0195; Sepulveda, Julio/0000-0002-8251-6937; Raberg, Jonathan/0000-0003-2959-3631; 														2375-2548				MAY 20	2022	8	20							eabm7625	10.1126/sciadv.abm7625	http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abm7625								35584215					WOS:000798164800012

However, an accurate atmospheric correction is required to retrieve water constituents based on surface water reflectance (R-W). In this paper, we assessed three atmospheric correction methods (Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6SV), ACOLITE and Sen2Cor) applied to an image acquired by the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) on-board of the European Space Agency's Sentinel-2A platform using concurrent in-situ measurements over four Amazon floodplain lakes in Brazil. In addition, we evaluated the correction of forest adjacency effects based on the linear spectral unmixing model, and performed a temporal evaluation of atmospheric constituents from Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) products. The validation of MAIAC aerosol optical depth (AOD) indicated satisfactory retrievals over the Amazon region, with a correlation coefficient (R) of similar to 0.7 and 0.85 for Terra and Aqua products, respectively. The seasonal distribution of the cloud cover and AOD revealed a contrast between the first and second half of the year in the study area. Furthermore, simulation of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance showed a critical contribution of atmospheric effects (>50%) to all spectral bands, especially the deep blue (92%-96%) and blue (84%-92%) bands. The atmospheric correction results of the visible bands illustrate the limitation of the methods over dark lakes (R-W < 1%), and better match of the R-W shape compared with in-situ measurements over turbid lakes, although the accuracy varied depending on the spectral bands and methods. Particularly above 705 nm, R-W was highly affected by Amazon forest adjacency, and the proposed adjacency effect correction minimized the spectral distortions in R-W (RMSE < 0.006). Finally, an extensive validation of the methods is required for distinct inland water types and atmospheric conditions.

The results showed that seasonal variations in the relative abundance of ARGs and mobile gene elements (MGEs) were significant (KW, p < 0.05). ARGs representative of fecal pollution and natural environment were primarily distributed in the river and reservoir, respectively. The lake, river, and reservoir shared 54.5% of ARGs subtypes, most of which are multidrug resistance genes encoding for efflux pumps. Network results showed that ARGs conferring resistance to aminoglycoside frequently co-occurred with class 1 integrons and Limnohabitans. The resistance risks were low and associated with non-corresponding ARGs, and the highest resistance risk was caused by enrofloxacin in the Dianshan Lake. Fluorescence indices derived from two methods exhibited consistent positive correlations with abundance of individual genes (i.e. aada1 and aadA2-03) as well as total aminoglycoside resistance genes (Pearson, p < 0.05). Moreover, ARGs indicators of human and animal fecal pollution showed linkages with humic-like and fulvic-like indices (Pearson, p < 0.05). The results provide novel insights into the roles of abiotic factors on indicating dynamics of ARGs in aquatic environment impacted by anthropogenic activities.

A global, high-resolution (30-m) inland water body dataset for 2000: first results of a topographic-spectral classification algorithm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH												The science and management of terrestrial ecosystems require accurate, high-resolution mapping of surface water. We produced a global, 30-m-resolution inland surface water dataset with an automated algorithm using Landsat-based surface reflectance estimates, multispectral water and vegetation indices, terrain metrics, and prior coarse-resolution water masks. The dataset identified 3,650,723 km(2) of inland water globally - nearly three quarters of which was located in North America (40.65%) and Asia (32.77%), followed by Europe (9.64%), Africa (8.47%), South America (6.91%), and Oceania (1.57%). Boreal forests contained the largest portion of terrestrial surface water (25.03% of the global total), followed by the nominal inland water' biome (16.36%), tundra (15.67%), and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests (13.91%). Agreement with respect to the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer water mask and Landsat-based national land-cover datasets was very high, with commission errors <4% and omission errors <14% relative to each. Most of these were accounted for in the seasonality of water cover, snow and ice, and clouds - effects which were compounded by differences in image acquisition date relative to reference datasets. The Global Land Cover Facility (GLCF) inland surface water dataset is available for open access at the GLCF website (http://www.landcover.org).

To accurately extract surface water from remote sensing imagery is very important for water environment conservations and water resource management. In this study, a new Multi-Band Water Index (MBWI) for Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images is proposed by maximizing the spectral difference between water and non-water surfaces using pure pixels. Based on the MBWI map, the K-means cluster method is applied to automatically extract surface water. The performance of MBWI is validated and compared with six widely used water indices in 29 sites of China. Results show that our proposed MBWI performs best with the highest accuracy in 26 out of the 29 test sites. Compared with other water indices, the MBWI results in lower mean water total errors by a range of 9.31%-25.99%, and higher mean overall accuracies and kappa coefficients by 0.87%-3.73% and 0.06-0.18, respectively. It is also demonstrated for MBWI in terms of robustly discriminating surface water from confused backgrounds that are usually sources of surface water extraction errors, e.g., mountainous shadows and dark built-up areas. In addition, the new index is validated to be able to mitigate the seasonal and daily influences resulting from the variations of the solar condition. MBWI holds the potential to be a useful surface water extraction technology for water resource studies and applications.

Large lakes, which serve as catch basins of anthropogenic inputs provide an ideal environment for understanding the occurrence and accumulation of ARGs and antibiotics in freshwater environments. Here, the largest freshwater lake in China, Poyang Lake, located in the developing district of Yangtze valley was used to study the characterization of the spatial and seasonal variation of both ARGs and antibiotics. Results showed that twelve tested ARGs (sul1, sul2, sul3, tetA, tetB, tetC, tetH, tetW, tetO, tetM, qnrS, and qnrB) were detected in the surface waters of Poyang Lake, with a detection frequency ranging from 19.2% to 100%, and sul2 and tetA genes were identified as potential indicators of ARG pollution in this region. Among the 11 analyzed antibiotics, sulfonamides were the predominant antibiotics with a contribution of more than 50% to the total concentrations of tested antibiotics. The total concentrations of both ARGs and antibiotics were higher in the dry season than those in the wet season. Furthermore, ARGs and antibiotics in the surface waters also varied with sampling locations, being consistently at riverine tributaries. Positive correlations were also observed between the concentrations of ARGs and antibiotics, as well as the integron gene (intI1), indicating that antibiotics and intI1 may be playing important roles in the occurrence and dispersal of ARGs in the surface waters. Lastly, our results suggest that intensive anthropogenic activities related to antibiotic usage have substantially contributed to the occurrence and persistence of ARGs and antibiotics in Poyang Lake.

Lake outburst and debris flow disaster at Kedarnath, June 2013: hydrometeorological triggering and topographic predisposition	LANDSLIDES												Heavy rainfall in June 2013 triggered flash flooding and landslides throughout the Indian Himalayan state of Uttarakhand, killing more than 6000 people. The vast majority of fatalities and destruction resulted directly from a lake outburst and debris flow disaster originating from above the village of Kedarnath on June 16 and 17. Here, we provide a systematic analysis of the contributing factors leading to the Kedarnath disaster, both in terms of hydrometeorological triggering and topographic predisposition. Topographic characteristics of the lake watershed above Kedarnath are compared with other glacial lakes across the north-western Himalayan states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, and implications for glacier lake outburst hazard assessment in a changing climate are discussed. Our analysis suggests that the early onset of heavy monsoon rainfall (390 mm, June 10-17) immediately following a 4-week period of unusually rapid snow cover depletion and elevated streamflow was the crucial hydrometeorological factor, resulting in slope saturation and significant run-off into the small seasonal glacial lake. Between mid-May and mid-June 2013, snow-covered area above Kedarnath decreased by around 50 %. The unusual situation of the lake being dammed in a steep, unstable paraglacial environment but fed entirely from snowmelt and rainfall within a fluvial dominated watershed is important in the context of this disaster. A simple scheme enabling large-scale recognition of such an unfavourable topographic setting is introduced. In view of projected 21st century changes in monsoon timing and heavy precipitation in South Asia, more emphasis should be given to potential hydrometeorological triggering of lake outburst and debris flow disasters in the Himalaya.

J	Ram, B; Kumar, M				Ram, Bhagwana; Kumar, Manish			Correlation appraisal of antibiotic resistance with fecal, metal and microplastic contamination in a tropical Indian river, lakes and sewage	NPJ CLEAN WATER												The present study compares the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) in the urban water of Ahmedabad (India), to understand the correlation of ARB with the fecal, metal, and microplastic contamination. Eleven samples, i.e., three locations of Sabarmati River along with one sample each from two (Chandola and Kankaria) lakes, and influents and effluents from three Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) were analyzed in this study. E. coli isolated from the samples were subjected to three fluoroquinolones (Levofloxacin (LVX), Ciprofloxacin (CIP), and Norfloxacin (NFX)) and three non-fluoroquinolones (Kanamycin Monosulphate (KM), Tetracycline (TC), and Sulfamethoxazole (ST)) antibiotics for resistance quantification. Prevalence of the E. coli in the Sabarmati River (19,467-76,600 cfu mL(-1)) was higher than the lakes and STP(s), except the influent sample at Juhapura STP. Among the lake samples, Kankaria Lake (KL) exhibited 0% resistance towards all six antibiotics despite 5x prevalence of E. coli than that of Chandola Lake (CL) exhibiting up to 60% resistance for non-fluoroquinolones and 40% resistance to NFX. Multivariate statistical analyses suggest that resistance for ST, KM, and TC is more prevalent and correlated with electrical conductivity (EC), finer size microplastic, manganese (Mn), and nickel (Ni), whereas the resistance for fluoroquinolones (LVX, CIP, and NFX) seems highly influenced by seasonal temperature variation. Larger size microplastic clustered with salinity, ORP, and Pb. Further, fecal contamination and antibiotic resistance seem to be governed by the same source and processes, yet it does not show good correlation except for the river samples. This result may be attributed to the dynamic river-human interface, substantial wastewater discharge into the river, stagnant water flow, and urbanization-related discharge conditions rather than the upstream condition.					; kumar, manish/KIE-1953-2024	Ram, Bhagwana/0000-0002-3457-7698; 													2059-7037					FEB 4	2020	3	1							3	10.1038/s41545-020-0050-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41545-020-0050-1													WOS:000510944500001
J	Yakymchuk, RA				Yakymchuk, R. A.			Cytogenetic activity of radionuclide contamination of water reservoirs of the alienation zone of Chornobyl NPP	REGULATORY MECHANISMS IN BIOSYSTEMS												Thirty years after the accident, the alienation zone of Chomobyl NPP continues to be an open source of radionuclide spread which is carried with superficial and soil waters into river systems and moves beyond the area. The study of mutagenic activity of radionuclide contamination of the water reservoirs in the near zone of Chornobyl NNP will make it possible to predict genetic consequences of their effect in the years after the accident. The purpose of this research is to study frequency and spectrum of chromosome aberrations in root meristem cells of Triticum aestivum L. under the prolonged effect of radionuclide contamination of water and bottom deposits of the water reservoirs in the near alienation zone of Chornobyl NPP. Seeds of winter wheat varieties Al'batros odes'kyi and Zymoiarka were sprouted in the conditions of the effect of water radionuclide contamination of the Prypiat River, Brahinka River, a reservoir-cooler of ChNPP, Semyhodskyi backwater, drainage-way 3 of ChNPP, Lakes Hlyboke and Azbuchyn (total specific activity of Cs-137 and Sr-90 - 0.17-52.99 Bq/M-3) and bottom deposits of the left and right banks of Prypiat canal, a reservoir-cooler of ChNPP, drainage-ways 1-3 of ChNPP (total specific activity of Cs-137 and Sr-90 - 16.0-45.0 Bq/kg). Frequency and spectrum of cytogenetic disorders were identified in the cells of root meristem sprouts with help of the ana-telophase method. Under the influence of radiation on water and bottom deposits of the water reservoirs in the alienation zone of ChNPP, a 1.6-4.2 times increase in the frequency of chromosome aberrations and mitosis disorders was found. The highest levels of cytogenetic activity were shown by water radionuclide contamination in a reservoir-cooler of ChNPP, Semyhodskyi backwater and bottom deposits of drainage-way 2. The correlation between frequency of chromosome aberrations and specific value of radionuclide activity of water reservoirs has not been recorded, which can prove the induction of cytogenetic disorders resulting from the radiation in the low-rate range. The spectrum of cytogenetic disorder types is mostly represented by acentric fragments, bridges and lagging chromosomes. The induction of the cells with lagging chromosomes, which exhibit the highest levels (0.24-0.38%), under the effect of radionuclide contamination of water in Hlyboke Lake, the Brahinka River, the Prypiat River, a reservoir-cooler of ChNPP and bottom deposits of drainage-way 3, allows one to assume the availability of aneugenic factors in the water reservoirs in the alienation zone of ChNPP. The water entities of the alienation zone of ChNPP, the level of radionuclide contamination of which is characterized by a high cytogenetic activity, induce cells with complex chromosome rearrangements of high frequency. Despite the decrease in chromosome aberration frequency effected by the water of the Prypiat River near Chornobyl city, the Brahinka River and bottom deposits of the right bank of Prypiat canal, the increased level of aneugenic cells and the induction of multiple chromosome rearrangements confirm the persistence of mutagenic activity in the abovementioned contaminated water entities.

In this study, the dynamics of microbial community with the role of nitrogen cycle in sediment in a coastal eutrophic lake were studied under a warm season. The water salinity gradually increased from 0.9%o in June to 4.2%o in July and 10.5%o in August because of seawater invasion. Bacterial diversity of surface water was positively related with salinity and nutrients of total nitrogen (TN) as well as total phosphorus (TP), but eukaryotic diversity had no relationship with salinity. In surface water, algae belonging to Cyanobacteria and Chlorophyta were dominant phyla in June with the relative abundances of >60%, but Proteobacteria became the largest bacterial phylum in August. The variation of these predominant microbes had strong relationship with salinity and TN. In sediment, the bacterial and eukaryotic diversity was greater than that of water, and a significantly different microbial community was observed with dominant bacterial phyla Proteobacteria and Chloroflexi, and dominant eukaryotic phyla Bacillariophyta, Arthropoda, and Chlorophyta. Proteobacteria was the only enhanced phylum in the sediment with the highest relative abundance of 54.62% +/- 8.34% due to seawater invasion. Denitrifying genera (29.60%-41.81%) were dominant in surface sediment, then followed by microbes related to nitrogen fixation (24.09%-28.87%), assimilatory nitrogen reduction (13.54%-19.17%), dissimilatory nitrite reduction to ammonium (DNRA, 6.49%-10.51%) and ammonification (3.07%-3.71%). Higher salinity caused by seawater invasion enhanced the accumulation of genes involved in dentrificaiton, DNRA and ammonification, but decreased genes related to nitrogen fixation and assimilatory nitrogen reduction. Significant variation of dominant genes of narG, nirS, nrfA, ureC, nifA and nirB mainly caused by the changes in Proteobacteria and Chloroflexi. The discovery of this study would be helpful to understand the variation of microbial community and nitrogen cycle in coastal lake under seawater intrusion.					阳, 广凤/ABC-9925-2022; Chen, Qingguo/E-4346-2014; Wu, Guiyang/GWQ-8314-2022; zhang, zeliang/AAF-6079-2019	Yang, Guang-feng/0000-0002-4320-2193; Yang, Qiao/0000-0002-7770-5389													0013-9351	1096-0953				MAY 15	2023	225								115590	10.1016/j.envres.2023.115590	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2023.115590		MAR 2023						36863651					WOS:000955938900001

An analytical liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed for 38 pesticides, which was applied in the monitoring of 240 surface water samples and 76 potential discharge source samples. Eleven insecticides and five fungicides with temporal and spatial variation were detected in surface water. The total pesticide concentrations in surface water in different seasons were as follows: March > August > June > November. The two most polluting and widespread pesticides were carbendazim (maximum concentration 508 ng L-1, detection rate 100%) and imidacloprid (maximum concentration 438 ng L-1, detection rate 88%). Gehu Lake (S46) and Sanshangang River (S12) were seriously polluted water bodies. Seven insecticides and four fungicides were detected in the potential discharge sources; and their composition changed significantly with the seasons. The concentrations of detected organophosphorus pesticides and neonicotinoids (e.g. acetamiprid in March and dichlorvos in November) in a few non-agricultural planting sources were far greater than those detected in surface water, and hence a few fish ponds, livestock and poultry farms, and sewage treatment plants might be the potential discharge sources of pesticides in the surrounding surface water. The estimated input flux of the studied pesticides from upstream rivers to Taihu Lake was 141.95 kg a(-1).

J	Cheng, X; Chen, LD; Sun, RH; Kong, PR				Cheng, Xian; Chen, Liding; Sun, Ranhao; Kong, Peiru			Land use changes and socio-economic development strongly deteriorate river ecosystem health in one of the largest basins in China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												It is important to assess river ecosystem health in large-scale basins when considering the complex influence of anthropogenic activities on these ecosystems. This study investigated the river ecosystem health in the Haihe River Basin (HRB) by sampling 148 river sites during the pre- and post-rainy seasons in 2013. A model was established to assess the river ecosystem health based on water physicochemical, nutrient, and macroinvertebrate indices, and the health level was divided into "very poor," "poor," "fair," "good," and "excellent" according to the health score calculated from the assessment model. The assessment results demonstrated that the river ecosystem health of the HRB was "poor" overall, and no catchments were labeled "excellent." The percentages of catchments deemed to have "very poor," "poor," "fair," or "good" river ecosystem health were 12.88%, 40.91%, 40.15%, and 6.06%, respectively. From the pre-to the post-rainy season, the macroinvertebrate health levels improved from "poor" to "fair." The results of a redundancy analysis (RDA), path analysis of the structural equation model (SEM), and X-Y plots indicated that the land use types of forest land and grassland had positive relationships with river ecosystem health, whereas arable land, urban land, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and population density had negative relationships with river ecosystem health. The variance partitioning (VP) results showed that anthropogenic activities (including land use and socio-economy) together explained 30.9% of the variations in river ecosystem health in the pre-rainy season, and this value increased to 35.9% in the post-rainy season. Land use intensity was the first driver of river ecosystem health, and socio-economic activities was the second driver. Land use variables explained 20.5% and 25.7% of the variations in river ecosystem health in the pre-and post-rainy season samples, respectively, and socio-economic variables explained 12.3% and 17.2% of the variations, respectively. The SEM results revealed that urban land had the strongest impact on water quality health and that forest land had the strongest impact on macroinvertebrate health. This study has implications for the selection of appropriate indicators to assess river ecosystem health and generated data to examine the effects of anthropogenic activities on river ecosystem health in a fast-growing region.

Evaluating global temperature calibrations for lacustrine branched GDGTs: Seasonal variability, paleoclimate implications, and future directions	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) preserved in lake sediments are increasingly used to investigate past terrestrial temperatures. brGDGTs are ubiquitous in sedimentary environments, well-preserved, and the number of methyl groups in different brGDGTs is generally controlled by temperature. Current brGDGT calibrations largely rely on empirical correlations between the relative abundances of different brGDGTs in surface sediments and either mean annual or warm season air temperatures. These approaches may introduce complications in global temperature calibrations due to differences in the seasonality of temperature and variations in brGDGT production with latitude that are difficult to constrain. Here, we report new brGDGTs data from lake surface sediments obtained throughout the tropics including South America (n 1/4 57), East Africa (n 1/4 21), and Southeast Asia (n 1/4 13), and revisit globally distributed brGDGT data. We find a uniform response of brGDGTs to mean annual air temperature across the tropics despite differences in the environmental and geological conditions in different regions highlighting the dominant influence of temperature on brGDGT distributions. brGDGTs in mid- and high latitude sediment show a qualitatively similar but quantitatively different response to those in the tropics. We show that temperature seasonality can partially explain the latitudinal differences, implying the need for latitudinally-dependent brGDGT calibrations and/or improved observations and models to constrain seasonal effects on brGDGTs. Combining our new data with previously published brGDGT data, we develop and apply improved temperature calibrations.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Analyzing the Lake Urmia restoration progress using ground-based and spaceborne observations	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Lake Urmia, located in the North West of Iran, was once the most extensive permanent hypersaline lake in the world. Unsustainable water management in response to increasing demand together with climatic extremes have given rise to the lake's depletion during the last two decades. The Urmia Lake Restoration Program (ULRP) was established in 2013 and aims to restore the lake within a 10-year program.This study aims to monitor these restoration endeavours using spacebome and ground-based observations. We analyzed the in-situ water level, the surface water extent, and the water volume of the lake. The water storage change of the Urmia Lake catchment is quantified using the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On satellite observations, which gives us a holistic view of hydrological components. Our analysis shows a positive trend of 14.5 cm/yr, 204 km(2)/yr, and 0.42 km(3)/yr in the time series of lake water level, lake water area, and water volume from 2015 to 2019 which indicates a short-lived stabilization of Lake Urmia. This has been achieved mainly due to an increase of 035 km(3)/yr in inflow from rivers to the lake, predominantly driven by anomalous precipitation events in 2016 and early 2019. However, the long-term trend from 2003 to 2019 still shows negative values of -22 cm/yr, -200 km(2)/yr, and -0.72 km(3)/yr for the water level, the surface area, and the water volume of the lake, respectively. The stabilization seems to be fragile however, since most of the increase in the water volume of the lake has spread over the large shallow southern region with high evaporation potential during hot seasons. Furthermore, due to the high correlation between the lake water level and precipitation, the recovery observed in 2016 and the first half of 2019 might not continue in case of a long drought period.

Levent			Modeling impacts of future climate change on reservoir storages and irrigation water demands in a Mediterranean basin	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Water storage requirements in the Mediterranean region vary in lime and are strongly affected by the local geography and climate conditions. The objective of this study is to assess the implications of climate change on the water balance of an agricultural reservoir in a Mediterranean-climate basin in Turkey throughout the 21st century. A monthly dynamic water balance model is developed to simulate the historical and future water availability in the reservoir. The model is driven by the fine-resolution dynamically downscaled climate data from four GCMs from the CMIP5 archive, namely CCSM4, GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, and MIR005, under two different representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), and the hydrologic data projected under the same scenarios. The reservoir outflows, including the reservoir evaporation and downstream irrigation water demands, are also modeled using the projected climate variables. The net irrigation water requirement of the crops in the irrigation system, seasonal evapotranspiration rates, and reservoir evaporation rates are estimated based on the Penman-Monteith Evapotranspiration method (FAO-56 Method). The study investigates whether the future water supply in the reservoir will be sufficient to meet the future irrigation water demands for the years from 2017 to 2100. The results show that under all eight modeled climate change projections, statistically significant increasing trends for the annual irrigation water demands are expected throughout the 21st century. Moreover, higher evapotranspiration rates are predicted under the ensemble average of the RCP8.5 projections, compared to those of the RCP4.5 projections. Ultimately, seven out of eight projections projected insufficient reservoir water levels during the 21st century, especially during the irrigation seasons when higher water demands are expected. These impacts indicate the importance of sustainable water resources management in the region to provide irrigation water from reservoirs, and to sustain agricultural productivity under projected water limitations due to climate change.

Assessment of heavy metal contamination in the sediment of the River Ghaghara, a major tributary of the River Ganga in Northern India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The present study includes a systematic analysis of sediment contamination by heavy metals of the River Ghaghara flowing through the Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in Indian Territory. To estimate the geochemical environment of the river, seven heavy metals, namely Co, Cu, Cr, Ni, Cd, Zn, and Pb were examined from the freshly deposited river bed sediment. All the sediment samples were collected on a seasonal basis for the assessment of fluctuation in 2014-2015 and after preparation samples were analyzed using standard procedure. Result showed that heavy metal concentration ranged between 11.37 and 18.42 mg/kg for Co, 2.76 and 11.74 mg/kg for Cu, 61.25 and 87.68 mg/kg for Cr, 15.29 and 25.59 mg/kg for Ni, 0.21 and 0.28 mg/kg for Cd, 13.26 and 17.59 mg/kg for Zn, 10.71 and 14.26 mg/kg for Pb in different season. Metal contamination factor indicates the anthropogenic input in the river sediment was in the range of (0.62-0.97) for Co, (0.04-0.26) for Cu, (0.68-0.97) for Cr, (0.22-0.38) for Ni, (0.70-0.93) for Cd, (0.14-0.19) for Zn, and (0.54-0.71) for Pb. The highest contamination degree of the sediment was noticed as 4.01 at Ayodhya and lowest as 3.16 at Katerniaghat. Geo-accumulation index was noted between (0 and 1) which showed that sediment was uncontaminated to moderately contaminated and may have adverse affects on freshwater ecology of the river. Pollution load index (PLI) was found highest at Chhapra which was 0.45 and lowest at Katerniaghat which was 0.35 and it indicates that the river sediment has a low level of contamination. Significant high correlation was observed between Co, Cu, and Zn, it suggests same source of contamination input is mainly due to human settlement and agriculture activity. Positive correlation between Zn, Co, Cu, Cr, and Ni indicated a natural origin of these elements in the river sediment. Cluster analysis suggests grouping of similar polluted sites. The strong similarity between Co, Zn, Pb, Ni, Cu, and Cd showed relationship of these metals come from the same origin, which is possibly from natural and anthropogenic input which was also confirmed by correlation analysis. Using the various pollution indicators it was found that the river bed sediment is less contaminated by toxic metals during the study but the sediment quality may degrade in the near future due to increasing anthropogenic inputs in the river basin, hence proper management strategies are required to control the direct dumping of wastewater in the river.					singh, sudhir/HNS-9950-2023														2190-5487	2190-5495				NOV	2017	7	7					4133	4149		10.1007/s13201-017-0572-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-017-0572-y													WOS:000413254300059

Using stable isotopes to assess surface water source dynamics and hydrological connectivity in a high-latitude wetland and permafrost influenced landscape	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Climate change is expected to alter hydrological and biogeochemical processes in high-latitude inland waters. A critical question for understanding contemporary and future responses to environmental change is how the spatio-temporal dynamics of runoff generation processes will be affected. We sampled stable water isotopes in soils, lakes and rivers on an unprecedented spatio-temporal scale along a 1700 km transect over three years in the Western Siberia Lowlands. Our findings suggest that snowmelt mixes with, and displaces, large volumes of water stored in the organic soils and lakes to generate runoff during the thaw season. Furthermore, we saw a persistent hydrological connection between water bodies and the landscape across permafrost regions. Our findings help to bridge the understanding between small and large scale hydrological studies in high-latitude systems. These isotope data provide a means to conceptualise hydrological connectivity in permafrost and wetland influenced regions, which is needed for an improved understanding of future biogeochemical changes.

In this review, we compile archaeological and palaeoenvironmental data from East Africa to document land-cover change, and environmental, subsistence and land-use transitions, over the past 6000 years. Throughout East Africa there have been a series of relatively rapid and high-magnitude environmental shifts characterised by changing hydrological budgets during the mid- to late Holocene. For example, pronounced environmental shifts that manifested as a marked change in the rainfall amount or seasonality and subsequent hydrological budget throughout East Africa occurred around 4000, 800 and 300 radiocarbon years before present (yr BP). The past 6000 years have also seen numerous shifts in human interactions with East African ecologies. From the mid-Holocene, land use has both diversified and increased exponentially, this has been associated with the arrival of new subsistence systems, crops, migrants and technologies, all giving rise to a sequence of significant phases of land-cover change. The first large-scale human influences began to occur around 4000 yr BP, associated with the introduction of domesticated livestock and the expansion of pastoral communities. The first widespread and intensive forest clearances were associated with the arrival of iron-using early farming communities around 2500 yr BP, particularly in productive and easily-cleared mid-altitudinal areas. Extensive and pervasive land-cover change has been associated with population growth, immigration and movement of people. The expansion of trading routes between the interior and the coast, starting around 1300 years ago and intensifying in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries CE, was one such process. These caravan routes possibly acted as conduits for spreading New World crops such as maize (Zea mays), tobacco (Nicotiana spp.) and tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum), although the processes and timings of their introductions remains poorly documented. The introduction of southeast Asian domesticates, especially banana (Musa spp.), rice (Oryza spp.), taro (Colocasia esculenta), and chicken (Gallus gallus), via transoceanic biological transfers around and across the Indian Ocean, from at least around 1300 yr BP, and potentially significantly earlier, also had profound social and ecological consequences across parts of the region. Through an interdisciplinary synthesis of information and metadatasets, we explore the different drivers and directions of changes in land-cover, and the associated environmental histories and interactions with various cultures, technologies, and subsistence strategies through time and across space in East Africa. This review suggests topics for targeted future research that focus on areas and/or time periods where our understanding of the interactions between people, the environment and land-cover change are most contentious and/or poorly resolved. The review also offers a perspective on how knowledge of regional land-use change can be used to inform and provide perspectives on contemporary issues such as climate and ecosystem change models, conservation strategies, and the achievement of nature-based solutions for development purposes.

Small ponds are often constructed in urban areas, where they receive large amounts of nutrients and therefore tend to be highly productive. Here, we investigated GHG emissions, seasonal and diel variation, and net ecosystem production (NEP) from an urban pond. In monthly 24-h field campaigns during 11 months, diffusive water-atmosphere methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes and CH4 ebullition and oxidation were quantified. With oxygen (O-2) measurements, NEP was assessed. The pond was a net GHG source the entire year, with an emission of 3.4 kg CO2 eq m(-2) yr(-1). The dominant GHG emission pathway was CH4 ebullition (bubble flux, 50%), followed by diffusive emissions of CO2 (38%) and CH4 (12%). Sediment CH4 release was primarily driven by temperature and especially ebullition increased exponentially above a temperature threshold of 15 degrees C. The pond's atmospheric CO2 exchange was not related to NEP or temperature but likely to a high allochthonous carbon (C) input via runoff and anaerobic mineralization of C. We expect urban ponds to show a large increase in GHG emission with increasing temperature, which should be considered carefully when constructing ponds in urban areas. Emissions may partly be counteracted by pond management focusing on a reduction of nutrient and organic matter input.					; Barros, Nathan/D-5944-2013; Kosten, Sarian/D-7550-2011; Huszar, Vera/J-7126-2012; Althuizen, Inge/AAO-6294-2021; Barros, Nathan/IZP-5388-2023; Roland, Fabio/C-7918-2013; Lamers, Leon/A-8718-2012	Althuizen, Inge/0000-0003-3485-9609; Huszar, Vera/0000-0002-8096-1404; Barros, Nathan/0000-0003-1752-8621; van Bergen, Tamara/0000-0002-5840-0977													0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2019	64	5					2129	2139		10.1002/lno.11173	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11173													WOS:000485001400020

In this study, two models are developed and applied for water temperature forecasting in lake systems: (1) the multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) model; and (2) the wavelet transform and MLPNN integrated model (WT_MLPNN). The models are applied to forecast daily lake surface water temperature (LSWT) of eight lowland Polish lakes. Long-term daily LSWT from eight lakes and daily air temperatures from seven meteorological stations are used for daily LSWT forecasting. The results from the two models are compared with those obtained from two other widely used models: the physically-statistically based hybrid air2water model and a non-linear regression model (S-curve). The modelling results show that the air2water model performs the best, followed by the WT_MLPNN, MLPNN, and the non-linear regression model. Overall, the air2water, WT_MLPNN, and MLPNN models reproduce well the seasonal and inter-annual variations of the LSWT dynamics in the eight lakes. The non-linear regression model, although providing the lowest accuracy, can still provide good preliminary estimates of the LSWT for the eight lakes. The outcomes of the present research can provide references for forecasting lake surface water temperature and sustainable management of lake ecosystems.					; Ptak, Mariusz/O-3217-2015; Yaseen, Zaher/G-7029-2018	Zhu, Senlin/0000-0003-2803-5419; Ptak, Mariusz/0000-0003-1225-1686; Yaseen, Zaher/0000-0003-3647-7137													0022-1694	1879-2707				JUN	2020	585								124809	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124809	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124809													WOS:000544230000066
J	Zohary, T; Flaim, G; Sommer, U				Zohary, Tamar; Flaim, Giovanna; Sommer, Ulrich			Temperature and the size of freshwater phytoplankton	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We review the literature on the relationship between water temperature and size of freshwater phytoplankton, to examine the hypothesis that freshwater phytoplankton, like marine phytoplankton and many other groups of organisms, conform to Bergmann's Rule and become smaller with warming. We provide both experimental and field evidence in support of the above hypothesis, much of this evidence was hidden in studies focused on other issues, but presenting temperature and phytoplankton size data. Freshwater phytoplankton size shrinks with increasing temperature at both the species level (by cells or colonies becoming smaller) and at the community level (shift to smaller species). Exceptions to the Rule do occur but in most cases those exceptions can be explained by indirect effects of temperature on phytoplankton size, via processes such as grazing or nutrient availability. With global warming, freshwater phytoplankton are likely to be of smaller size. This article is dedicated to Colin S. Reynolds, who has had a leading role in our personal education and understanding of phytoplankton ecology.

In the study, heavy metal (As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, Pb, Cd, Hg, Fe, Al, Mn) concentrations of seasonal lake water and bottom sediment samples were determined to evaluate the heavy metal pollution. Several index methods were applied, and pollution assess-ments were made using the obtained analysis results of lake water and sediment samples. The average con-centrations of the heavy metals in the lake waters are observed as Fe > Al > Mn > As>Zn > Ni > Pb > Cr > Cu > Hg > Cd. When the lake waters were compared with the TS 266 (2005) and WHO (2017) limit values, it was determined that lake waters are below the limit values in terms of the heavy metals. According to index results, all of the lake samples are suitable for use as drinking water in accordance with the heavy metal pollution index (HPI) value, all of the samples are in the "low pollution" class in accordance with the heavy metal evaluation index (HEI) and degree of contamination (Cd) values. In addition, the water average concentrations of the heavy metals in the lake sediments are observed as Fe > Al > Mn > Cr > Ni > Zn > Cu > As>Pb > Cd > Hg. The contamination factor (CF) and enrichment factor (EF) revealed that sediments were considerably and moderately polluted by As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Cd, Fe and Mn and low polluted and/or unpolluted by other metals. The calculated pollution load index (PLI) and Igeo values indicate that lake sediments do not carry a risk of heavy metal contamination.

Seasonal variations, risk assessment and multivariate analysis of trace metals in the freshwater reservoirs of Pakistan	CHEMOSPHERE												Water samples were collected from three freshwater reservoirs of Pakistan during three seasons (pre monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon). The collected samples were examined for the concentrations of selected trace metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr and Zn) and physicochemical parameters (pH, T, EC, TDS, DO, Cl-). Among the metals, Co, Pb and Sr revealed relatively higher concentrations while Cd, Mn and Zn exhibited fairly lower contents. Most of the metals (except Co) revealed considerably higher contributions in the pre -monsoon period. The average levels of Cr, Co, Cd, Pb and Ni exceeded the national/international guideline limits. Pollution assessment highlighted significant pollution; mainly by Cd, Cr, Ni and Pb. Evaluation of health risk indicated that Cr, Cd, Co, Pb and Ni were associated with high risks (HQ(ing) > 1), especially for the children. Principal component analysis showed anthropogenic contributions of Cd, Cr, Co, Pb and Ni, while significant spatial variability was shown by cluster analysis. The highest metal pollution was found at sites near to the entrances of the reservoirs and/or near to the urbanized areas. This study revealed that priority pollutants of concern were Cr, Cd, Co, Pb and Ni; therefore, immediate remedial measures should be implemented for sustaining the healthy aquatic ecosystems.

Late Quaternary MIS 6-8 shoreline features of pluvial Owens Lake, Owens Valley, eastern California	LATE CENOZOIC DRAINAGE HISTORY OF THE SOUTHWESTERN GREAT BASIN AND LOWER COLORADO RIVER REGION: GEOLOGIC AND BIOTIC PERSPECTIVES	Geological Society of America Special Papers				Workshop on Geologic and Biotic Perspectives on Late Cenozoic Drainage History of the Southwestern Great Basin and Lower Colorado River Region	APR 12-15, 2005	CA	US Geol Survey Earth Surface Dynam Program, US Geol Survey Natl Cooperat Geol Mapping Program, Smithsonian Inst				The chronologic history of pluvial Owens Lake along the eastern Sierra Nevada in Owens Valley, California, has previously been reported for the interval of time from ca. 25 calibrated ka to the present. However, the age, distribution, and paleoclimatic context of higher-elevation shoreline features have not been formally documented. We describe the location and characteristics of wave-formed erosional and depositional features, as well as fluvial strath terraces that grade into an older shoreline of pluvial Owens Lake. These pluvial-lacustrine features are described between the Olancha area to the south and Poverty Hills area to the north, and they appear to be vertically deformed similar to 20 +/- 4 m across the active oblique-dextral Owens Valley fault zone. They occur at elevations from 1176 to 1182 m along the lower flanks of the Inyo Mountains and Coso Range east of the fault zone to as high as similar to 1204 m west of the fault zone. This relict shoreline, referred to as the 1180 m shoreline, lies similar to 20-40 m higher than the previously documented Last Glacial Maximum shoreline at similar to 1160 m, which occupied the valley during marine isotope stage 2 (MIS 2). Crosscutting relations of wave-formed platforms, notches, and sandy beach deposits, as well as strath terraces on lava flows of the Big Pine volcanic field, bracket the age of the 1180 m shoreline to the time interval between ca. 340 +/- 60 ka and ca. 130 +/- 50 ka. This interval includes marine oxygen isotope stages 8-6 (MIS 8-6), corresponding to 260-240 ka and 185-130 ka, respectively. An additional age estimate for this shoreline is provided by a cosmogenic Cl-36 model age of ca. 160 + 32 ka on reefal tufa at similar to 1170 m elevation from the southeastern margin of the valley. This Cl-36 model age corroborates the constraining ages based on dated lava flows and refines the lake age to the MIS 6 interval. Documentation of this larger pluvial Owens Lake offers insight to the hydrologic balance along the east side of the southern Sierra Nevada and will assist with future regional paleoclimatic models within the western Basin and Range.

To date, their environmental distribution in water samples from the lower Yangtze River Basin still remains uncharacterized. This study systematically investigated the occurrence and spatial distribution of 13 OPEs, as well as their associated potential risks, in water samples from the lower Yangtze River and its 88 major inflowing rivers. The total OPE (Sigma OPEs) concentrations ranged from 55.6 to 5071 ng/L, with a median of 144 ng/L. Among them, halogenated OPEs were the dominant group with an average of 61.6%, and tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (12.6450 ng/L, median: 53.38 ng/L) and tris(2-choroethyl) phosphate (11.01202 ng/L, median: 36.4 ng/L) were the most abundant OPEs. Significantly different concentrations were found with spatial variations (p < 0.01), and were higher in southern cities than in northern cities of the lower Yangtze River Basin. Principal component analysis with multiple linear regression and Spearman correlations showed that the main sources were likely emission of vehicular and marine traffic. Ecological risk analysis showed that the risk quotient (RQ) values of samples remained below 1, but the percentage of 0.1 < RQ <= 1 was 26.9%, indicating a medium risk of OPEs in water samples. Moreover, ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate predominantly contributed to the ecological risk, accounting for >89.2% of the total ecological risk of Sigma OPEs. However, the total non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks of Sigma OPEs were negligible at the detected concentrations, even in a high exposure scenario. The risks from major inflowing rivers of the lower Yangtze River were almost one order of magnitude higher than those of the mainstream lower Yangtze River.					; Xing, Liqun/AAF-2083-2019	Jia, Shuyu/0000-0002-3103-9659; Xing, Liqun/0000-0001-9505-7330; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				SEP 10	2020	734								139380	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139380	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139380								32464373					WOS:000540257300006

Recent advances on the removal of phosphorus in aquatic plant-based systems	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION												Phosphorus (P) is a vital nutrient for the ecosystems and its excess in wastewater streams leads to some environmental issues such as extensive algae growth (eutrophication). Phytoremediation is a green technology that is based on the combined actions of plants and their associated microbial groups to remove and transfer the toxic compounds in surface water, groundwater and soil. Aquatic plants are widely used for the remediation of contaminated rivers, eutrophic lakes, and other water bodies. In the past three decades, free-floating, submerged, emergent macrophytes and microalgae species have been used for P removal in aquatic plant-based systems such as constructed wetlands (CWs). This paper reviews the recent studies on the potential of aquatic plants such as free-floating, submerged, and emergent plants, and also microalgae for removal of P in different types of wastewaters. Several parameters such as plant species, hydraulic retention time, temperature, type of CWs, effluent concentration, and seasonal changes have effects on P removal. Based on the findings, some of the species such as Azolla and water hyacinth had the highest uptake ability up to 90% while algae species such as Chlorella showed about 70% of P removal. In addition, the mixed culture of aquatic plants can increase P removal if the interaction of the species is considered before cultivation in CWs. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

J	Zhang, MM; Chen, F; Guo, HD; Yi, L; Zeng, JY; Li, B				Zhang, Meimei; Chen, Fang; Guo, Huadong; Yi, Lu; Zeng, Jiangyuan; Li, Bin			Glacial Lake Area Changes in High Mountain Asia during 1990-2020 Using Satellite Remote Sensing	RESEARCH												Changes in a large-scale glacial lake area directly reflect the regional glacier status and climate changes. However, long time series of glacial lake dataset and comprehensive investigation of the spatiotemporal changes in the glacial lake area in the whole High Mountain Asia (HMA) region remained elusive. Satellite remote sensing provides an indispensable way for dynamic monitoring of glacial lakes over large regions. But glacial lakes are quite small and discretely distributed, and the extraction of glacial lakes is usually influenced by clouds, snow/ice cover, and terrain shadows; thus, there is a lack of an automatic method to continuously monitor the dynamic changes of glacial lakes in a large scale. In this paper, we developed a per-pixel composited method named the "multitemporal mean NDWI composite" to automatically extract the glacial lake area in HMA from 1990 to 2020 using time-series Landsat data. There were 19,294 glacial lakes covering a total area of 1471.85 +/- 366.42 k m2 in 1990, and 22,646 glacial lakes with an area of 1729.08 +/- 461.31 km(2) in 2020. It is noted that the glacial lake area in the whole HMA region expanded by 0.58 +/- 0.21%/a over the past three decades, with high spatiotemporal heterogeneity. The glacial lake area increased at a consistent speed over time. The fastest expansion was in East Kun Lun at an average rate of 2.01 +/- 0.54%/a, while in the Pamir and Hengduan Shan, they show slow increases with rates of 0.33 +/- 0.08%/a and 0.39 +/- 0.01 %/a, respectively, during 1990-2020. The greatest increase in lake area occurred at 5000-5200 m a.s.l., which increased by about 45 km(2) (similar to 25%). We conclude that the temperature rise and glacier thinning are the leading factors of glacial lake expansion in HMA, and precipitation is the main source of lake water increase in West Kun Lun. Using the proposed method, a large amount of Landsat images from successive years of melting seasons can be fully utilized to obtain a pixel-level composited cloud-free and solid snow/ice-free glacial lake map. The uncertainties from supraglacial ponds and glacial meltwater were also estimated to improve the reliability and comparability of glacial lake area changes among different regions. This study provides important technical and data support for regional climate changes, glacier hydrology, and disaster analysis.

J	Guo, LC; Su, N; Zhu, CY; He, Q				Guo, Leicheng; Su, Ni; Zhu, Chunyan; He, Qing			How have the river discharges and sediment loads changed in the Changjiang River basin downstream of the Three Gorges Dam?	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Streamflow and sediment loads undergo remarkable changes in worldwide rivers in response to climatic changes and human interferences. Understanding their variability and the causes is of vital importance regarding river management. With respect to the Changjiang River (CJR), one of the largest river systems on earth, we provide a comprehensive overview of its hydrological regime changes by analyzing long time series of river discharges and sediment loads data at multiple gauge stations in the basin downstream of Three Gorges Dam (TGD). We find profound river discharge reduction during flood peaks and in the wet-to-dry transition period, and slightly increased discharges in the dry season. Sediment loads have reduced progressively since 1980s owing to sediment yield reduction and dams in the upper basin, with notably accelerated reduction since the start of TGD operation in 2003. Channel degradation occurs in downstream river, leading to considerable river stage drop. Lowered river stages have caused a 'draining effect' on lakes by fostering lake outflows following TGD impoundments. The altered river-lake interplay hastens low water occurrence inside the lakes which can worsen the drought given shrinking lake sizes in long-term. Moreover, lake sedimentation has decreased since 2002 with less sediment trapped in and more sediment flushed out of the lakes. These hydrological changes have broad impacts on river flood and drought occurrences, water security, fluvial ecosystem, and delta safety. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ebinur Lake is an important component of the ecological bather of Junggar Basin, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), China. Due to the tremendous changes in Ebinur Lake and surrounding marshes during the last decades, Ebinur Lake becomes a representative ecological degradation region in northwestern China. The detection of the intra-annual variations of water body and its responses to changing environment are critical for regional ecological security and rehabilitation of degraded ecosystem. To extract more accurate water information using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and further fill the gap of intermonth dynamic monitoring of Ebinur Lake, a new SAR water index (modified Sentinel 1A water index, MSWI) was proposed based on the relationship between normalized difference water index (NDWI) imageries and Sentinel 1A data. The dynamic thresholds of classification were selected using Otsu method and the results showed that the classification results were acceptable with the optimal overall accuracy of 99.94% and kappa coefficient of 0.9971, respectively. We conduct a time series analysis of surface areas of Ebinur Lake using S1A data from February 9th, 2017 to February 4th, 2018. The maximum lake surface area was 965.29 km(2) in April 22nd, 2017, while the minimum value was 750.37 km(2) in September 1st, 2017, and the mean area was 831.51 km(2). The seasonal variations showed the stages of "sharp rising" - "significant decreasing" - "gradual stabilizing" in the study period. The water surface area was highly correlated with inflow water volume (correlation coefficient = 0.72, P < 0.001).

The total cumulative concentrations of 21 PAE species (Sigma(21)PAEs) in the surface sediment ranged from 45.9 to 1474.1 ng.g(-1) dry weight (dw) and were from 17.9 to 2628.8 ng.mL(-1) in the pore water. Di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), and diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP) were the dominant components, and their sum accounted, on average, for 88.4% and 72.0% of Sigma(21)PAEs in the surface sediment and pore water, respectively. The spatial distributions of Sigma(21)PAEs in the surface sediment and pore water indicated that large amounts of the consumed products contained plasticizers in the urban and nearshore areas and increased the discharge of PAEs into the Haihe River. The river dam also affected PAEs distributions. The organic carbon normalized partitioning coefficient (log(KOC)) followed a sequence as dry season (2.47 +/- 0.35 mL-g(-1)) > wet season (2.02 +/- 0.45 mL.g(-1)) > normal season (1.98 +/- 0.42 mL.g(-1)). The risk quotient (RQ) method was employed to assess the potential ecological risk from specific species. High ecological risks of DEHP to the sensitive algae, crustacean, and fish species along with high ecological risks of DIBP to sensitive fish species were found in the surface sediment and pore water for all sampling seasons. In addition, DBP in the surface sediment and pore water exhibited moderate and high ecological risks to sensitive aquatic species. The highest RQ values for PAEs were found in the surface sediment and pore water in suburban and urban areas, respectively, and indicated that anthropogenic activities may cause severe river pollution and high risk to the local aquatic ecosystem. Capsule: High levels and ecological risks from PAEs were found in the urban river, and the partitioning behaviors of PAEs between the surface sediment and pore water were not significantly affected by their hydrophobicity, especially for species with low K-OW.

Sediment samples were collected from twenty one sites during two year monitoring in pre- and post-monsoon seasons (2007-2008). Heavy metal toxicity risk was assessed using Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs), effect range low/effect range median values (ERL/ERM), and threshold effect level/probable effect level (TEL/PEL). Greater mean concentrations of Ni, Mn and Pb were recorded in post-monsoon season whereas metal accumulation pattern in pre-monsoon season followed the order: Zn > Mn > Ni > Cr > Co > Cd > Pb > Cu > Li. Enrichment factor (EF) and geoaccumulation (I-geo) values showed that sediments were loaded with Cd, Zn, Ni and Mn. Comparison with uncontaminated background values showed higher concentrations of Cd, Zn and Ni than respective average shale values. Concentrations of Ni and Zn were above ERL values; however, Ni concentration exceeded the ERM values. Sediment contamination was attributed to anthropogenic and natural processes. The results can be used for effective management of fresh water hilly streams of Pakistan. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

There is a growing interest in the environmental research community about the occurrence, fates, sources, and risks of neonicotinoids. Nine neonicotinoids in river/lake water were measured at 12 sites along the Yangtze River Basin during the dry and wet seasons in 2016, and nonpoint sources were also identified based on a modified mass balance method. A significantly higher concentration of neonicotinoids was found during the dry season probably due to the dilution effect and insecticide consumption. The high pollution levels are due to posing high ecological risks compared with the recommended thresholds. In 2016, 1190 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 822-1690) tons of neonicotinoids were transferred into the adjacent sea. Nonpoint source pollution (1700 (CI = 12002370) tons) was the major contributor (91.3%) to the total input of neonicotinoids into the system. Composition profiles identifying specific neonicotinoid sources indicated some changes in usage patterns from old to new types of neonicotinoids. This spatial and seasonal field study and source identification is expected to fill the data gap regarding the limited information on neonicotinoid use patterns and to inform further effective policy-making and intervention programs in China that should be urgently promoted in the near future.

We investigated the spatio-temporal variation of hydrogeochemical parameters in surface water of Jimei Lake watershed, and distinguished the sources and transformation of nitrate-N (NO3- -N) using dual isotopes of nitrate (delta N-15 and delta O-18 in NO3-) with hydrogeochemical indicators. Principal component analysis (PCA) on hydrogeochemical parameters demonstrated that surface water was seriously polluted by nutrients, especially in the southeast of the downstream. There were signs of seawater intrusion and increased wastewater discharge in the mid-lower reaches with high ammonium concentrations. Nitrification occurred throughout the monitoring period with lower delta N-15 and delta O-18 values and NO3 derived from mixed pollution sources. Results of Bayesian model showed that dominant NO3- input originated from manure and sewage (M&S, 71% and 76% in the wet and dry season, respectively) and atmospheric deposition (22% and 16%, respectively). This result implied that the controls and treatment of M&S discharges are essential to alleviate of NO3- pollution. The proposed method is helpful to understand the origins of NO3- and may be suitable to develop measures for the reducing of nitrogen loadings in the periurban watershed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Over the past 50 years, the majority of workers have identified specimens in this genus as belonging to just 1-3 cosmopolitan species - A. beccarii, A. tepida and A. parkinsoniana. This has been partly because of the problems of discriminating the Ammonia species based entirely on shell morphology and partly because of a 1974 laboratory study that claimed to have shown that all morphologies were merely ecophenotypic variants of one species - a conclusion that molecular studies have proven to be unequivocally wrong. In this study we recognize, describe and figure sixty-seven living species and infraspecies of Recent Ammonia and two closely-related genera (Acarotrochus, Pseudoeponides) from around the world and summarize their ecological and biogeographic distribution. Twenty-six species and two subspecies are recognized by DNA sequencing and shown to be morphologically distinguishable. A further 39 morphospecies and one subspecies, that have not yet been sequenced, have sufficiently distinct morphology to be recognized. Canonical variates analysis using 42 measured or assessed morphological characters shows that the majority of these species can be readily discriminated by their test morphologies, although a few of the less-ornamented molecular species are verging on being pseudocryptic. Molecular sequencing of the type species of Challengerella (C. bradyi) and Helenina (H. anderseni) places them within our Ammonia clade. Here we continue to recognize the morphologically highly distinct genera Pseudoeponides (subjective senior synonym of Helenina) and allied Acarotrochus. Twenty new species or subspecies are described (molecular T types in brackets): Ammonia abramovichae (T8), A. akitaae, A. aoteana australiensis (T5A), A. arabica (T26), A. ariakensis quiltyi, A. buzasi (T11), A. fajemilai, A. goldsteinae, A. goodayi, A. haigi (T25), A. hattai, A. jorisseni (T23), A. justinparkeri, A. kitazatoi (T10), A. morleyae (T12), A. shchedrinae, A. turgida almogilabinae (T22M), Acarotrochus lippsi, Pseudoeponides hottingeri and P. dubuissoni. Aneotype is designated for A. veneta (Schultze 1854) (T1). We recognize 67 Ammonia and related taxa in this study but speculate that there may be 30 or more additional living species that we are not yet confident to discriminate without molecular sequencing. Ammonia species live in most parts of the world between 62 degrees N (Faeroe Islands) and 55 degrees S (Strait of Magellan), where seasonal sea-surface temperatures are 4-10 degrees C and above. One estuarine species ( A. veneta, T1) is cosmopolitan, euryhaline and eurythermic. Several species are widespread in one or two ocean regions (e.g., Atlantic and Mediterranean; South Pacific), whereas the majority are endemic to smaller areas (e.g., eastern Mediterranean; Caribbean-Gulf of Mexico). Eleven biogeographic "provinces" are recognized by cluster analysis of presence/absence records with the highest diversities in the Australian and northwest Pacific provinces with 18 and 19 species each). Levels of endemism in our "provinces" range between 0 (temperate Atlantic) and 44% (Australian).

Potentially toxic element (PTE) contaminations are considered extremely hazardous because of toxicity, persistence, and bioaccumulative behaviour. Many areas in the Southern African Development Community are data poor and have poor accessibility. The results of our previous research identified the presence of fossil waters in southern Limpopo National Park. Groundwater and river water are the only sources of drinking water for the villages in the study area. The current study focuses on the understanding of trace element distribution and health perspectives of PTEs (Hg, U, Sr, B, and Mn) in the groundwater and surface water samples (rivers and lakes) collected within the buffer zone of the Limpopo National Park, Southern Mozambique. Two sampling campaigns (October 2016-March 2017) were carried out during the end of the wet season and the end of the dry season to analyse the differences. The results improved our knowledge of the occurrence of trace elements in drinking water in an area where water resources play a fundamental role-because of their scarcity-and where the climate is harsh. ICP-MS results provided information on concentration ranges, highlighting the exceedance of the permissible maximum limit of mercury imposed by the World Health Organization on several groundwater samples. In the buffer zone of Limpopo Park, the highest levels of risk seem to be associated with the presence of Hg and U in drinking water. The use of risk assessment markers such as non-cancer risk value (hazard quotient [HQ]) revealed the exceedance of HQ values for Hg and U. The HQ values are higher in the wet season than the dry season, and most of the exceedance has been found in groundwater. HQ values are higher in exposed children than exposed adults. The water of Lake Massingir seems to be safer than any other source, but people do not currently use it because of the distance between the lake and their villages. Proactive control and research on alternative solutions for the water needs of the population and on creation of water distribution are recommended. In the current study, drinking water was the only route of exposure that was evaluated. Therefore, it would be appropriate to investigate the concentrations of PTEs in crops, livestock, and any other potential pathways.					; VITALE, STEFANIA/ISS-9000-2023; Barbieri, Maurizio/E-9260-2012	Ricolfi, Lorenzo/0000-0001-7101-3309; Barbieri, Maurizio/0000-0002-6595-103X													0269-4042	1573-2983				SEP	2020	42	9					2733	2745		10.1007/s10653-019-00507-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-019-00507-z								31907783					WOS:000560728100009

Today, humanity is in search of new sources of energy to make the economy more sustainable, as well as the need for a transition to energy that works on the principles of Carbon-Free Technology. For the Black Sea, this is expressed in the desire for successful implementation of the program Blue Growth Accelerator, which is aimed at the introduction of innovative tech-nologies and alternative energy sources in the energy sector of the Black Sea countries, for the development of the "Blue Economy" and the achievement of its healthy, productive and sustainable state. Salinity gradient power (SGP) is one of the new renewable energy sources. The most studied methods for obtaining SGP energy are technologies based on: Reverse Electrodialysis and Pressure Retarded Osmosis. The interaction of fresh and salt water can provide, in fact, unlimited, free and clean energy. The basis for the generation of such energy is the so-called salinity gradient that occurs when two types of water are mixed. After decades of work and numerous experiments, scientists have developed a way to use the energy of the salinity gradient to generate electricity. This type of electricity is also called "Blue Energy" by association with the color of mixing freshwater and salt water when rivers flow into the ocean. Places (estuaries or deltas), where rivers flow into the oceans and seas, have a truly enormous energy potential. The aim of this study is to identify sites in the northwestern Black Sea region with the necessary conditions for the development of Salinity Gradient Power energy, as well as to assess their potential using the example of estimating the maximum theoretical power of the Pressure Retarded Osmosis process.Research Methodology. In a PRO system, the less concentrated solution flows towards the more concentrated solution due to the positive osmotic pressure difference as long as this difference remains greater than the hydrostatic pressure difference. It is by this principle that osmotic power is produced. Theoretically available amount of energy released when mixing 1 m3 of saturated brine (5 mol/l NaCl solution) and 1 m3 of sea water (0.5 mol/l NaCl) at 293 K is 10 MJ. In the northwestern Black Sea region, along the coast between the Danube and Dnieper rivers, there are 21 limans (lagoons) of which some can be used to generate of Salinity Gradient Power.Results. The results of calculating the maximum net power showed that highest values obtained in the summer months, when the salinity in limans reaches its maximum and, consequently, its difference with the salinity of sea (river) water increases. Proceeding from maximum net power, obtained for the Western Sivash, where the salinity is maintained artificially at certain values, it can be seen that the annual amplitude has a smaller value, which provides more stable conditions. There are objects in the northwestern Black Sea region, in the waters of which, as soon as technologies become available, it will be possible to implement SGP projects. The Kuialnyk Liman, Sasyk-Sivash lake and Western Sivash have the most favorable conditions, where the highest power indicators are shown when using the sea water - hypersaline solution scheme, in which freshwater is not consumed.

J	Amiri, V; Nakagawa, K				Amiri, Vahab; Nakagawa, Kei			Using a linear discriminant analysis (LDA)-based nomenclature system and self-organizing maps (SOM) for spatiotemporal assessment of groundwater quality in a coastal aquifer	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												In this study, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) - based nomenclature system have been used for the classification of groundwater samples in a coastal aquifer. The capability of three models (7 hlr, 7 M conc, and Greater molar conc) in determining the water types has been investigated. The results show that Ca-HCO3, Na-Cl, and NaHCO3; and Ca-HCO3, Na-HCO3, and Na-Cl are the three dominant water types for the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The results of 7 hlr (basic + hybrid) model as the best option show that 42 and 27 water types can be identified for wet and dry seasons, respectively. Twenty-four physicochemical components have been used for the hydrogeochemical study of selected water resources based on Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM) method. The k-means clustering tool detected 7 and 6 clusters using the Davies-Bouldin index (DBI) for the wet and dry seasons, respectively. Hydrogeochemical assessment of duplicated samples showed that the seasonal changes can not cause significant changes in the chemical composition of groundwater resources of this aquifer. Radar diagrams of physicochemical variables showed some changes in the chemical composition of groundwater in some locations due to water-rock interaction as well as pollutants produced by human activities. Comparison of the results of classification of water samples by SOM and principal component analysis (PCA) shows that both methods can perform clustering of samples correctly. However, the SOM method provides more accurate clustering without any overlap between different clusters.

J	Hwang, JM; Ga, YJ; Yeh, JY				Hwang, Jeong-Min; Ga, Yun Ji; Yeh, Jung-Yong			Epidemiological Assessment of Risk Factors Associated with Bovine Ephemeral Fever Virus Exposure among Sheep and Goats in South Korea	ACTA SCIENTIAE VETERINARIAE												Background: Bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV) is an arthropod-borne virus classified as a type species of the genus Ephemerovirus, family Rhabdoviridae. BEFV is the causative agent of bovine ephemeral fever (BEF), a non-contagious disease of acute febrile clinical signs in cattle and water buffalo. Some species might act as reservoir hosts, and antibodies to BEFV have also been found in asymptomatic sheep, goats, pigs, and many wild animals. This study aimed to conduct a retrospective cross-sectional serological screening in South Korea to address BEFV seroprevalence and identify risk factors for becoming seropositive for the virus in sheep and goats. Materials, Methods & Results: The apparent prevalence rates were considered to be the animal-level prevalence, defined as the proportion of serum neutralization test (SNT)-positive animals out of the total number of animals tested in the study area, and flock prevalence was defined as the proportion of SNT-positive flocks out of the total number of tested flocks in the area. A flock was classified as positive if at least one animal was SNT-positive. At the national level in 2011, 28 of 177 flocks (15.8%; 95% CI, 11.2-21.9%) and 71 of 498 heads (14.3%, 95% CI: 11.5-17.6%) that were analyzed showed serum neutralizing antibodies against BEFV. Our results revealed that age class, vector control, and geographic location affected seroprevalence to differing extents. In the univariate analysis, older age was a significant risk factor (OR, 2.327; 95% CI, 1.147-4.721; P = 0.017 in adults). The management risk factor attributes showed that preventive measures, such as routine application of insecticides in farms, decreased the odds of seropositivity for BEFV (OR, 0.514; 95% CI, 0.267-0.991; P = 0.044). Vector control was a significant protective factor, while animal species, flock size, and flock structure were not significantly associated. Differences in seroprevalence between variations in the presence of ruminant farms, lakes, or rice paddies within a 1-km radius or type of land use were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). We observed a significant difference in the individual likelihood of being positive in the southern provinces with respect to that in the northern provinces (OR, 2.166; 95% CI, 1.228-3.824; P = 0.007). Differences in seroprevalence between variations in the eastern and western regions were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The retrospective study results showed that the virus was widely distributed in sheep and goats in South Korea, with seropositive rates ranging from 7.8% to 19.7% between 2003 and 2008. Discussion: This is the first report of circulating antibodies against BEFV in sheep and goats in South Korea. The serological prevalence of BEFV infection in sheep and goats was significantly different between different age cohorts, vector control, and geographical locations: it was higher in the older group and the southern and western regions of South Korea. Determination of seropositivity rates often leads to an understanding of virus circulation dynamics and is useful in the formulation of disease control measures. Our results demonstrated that vector control was a significant protective factor; therefore, the summer control of vectors could be better implemented in provinces with elevated seropositivity rates. The results of this seroprevalence study may serve as a basis for future epidemiological studies on BEFV infection in South Korea.

By investigating the planktonic and sedimentary bacteria during four seasons from 88 samples of 11 representative sites across the Danjiangkou reservoir, we depicted an integrated biogeographic pattern of bacterial communities in the water source of the world's largest water diversion project. Our study revealed both planktonic (mantel r = 0.502, P = 0.001) and sedimentary (mantel r = 0.131, P = 0.009) bacterial communities were significantly correlated with environmental heterogeneity, but a weak disparity along spatial heterogeneity, and the significant seasonal dynamics of planktonic (mantel r = 0.499, P = 0.001) rather than sedimentary bacteria. Particularly, rare biosphere played a main role in determining the community succession in the reservoir. It not only exhibited a more striking environmental separation than abundant taxa but also was an essential part in mediating spatiotemporal shifts of planktonic bacteria and maintaining the stability of bacterial community. These rare bacteria were respectively mediated by stochastic (62.68%) and selective (79.60%) processes in water and sediments despite abundant taxa being largely determined by stochastic processes (86.88-93.96%). Overall, our study not only fills a gap in understanding the bacterial community dynamics and underlying drivers in source water reservoirs, but also highlights the particular importance of rare bacteria in mediating biogeochemical cycles in world's large reservoir ecosystems.

The occurrence of algal blooms has become a major problem affecting water quality in Chaohu Lake. To understand the relationship between the microplastic distribution and algal bloom density from a macroscopic point of view in Chaohu Lake, we collected microplastic samples from water and sediments during the wet and dry seasons and collected satellite remote sensing images of the algae density in recent years. The research results showed that the spatial and temporal distributions of microplastics were uneven and varied greatly. The average abundances of microplastics in the water samples were 2133 +/- 1534 n.m(-3) in the dry season and 1679 +/- 1577 n.m(-3) in the wet season, and the average abundance of microplastics in sediments was 308 +/- 231 n.kg(-1). The abundance of microplastics in the estuaries was higher than those in other locations, and it was higher in the western part of the lake than in the eastern part. The microplastics in water and sediments presented different sizes, colors, shapes and compositions. The abundance, distribution and migration of microplastics were mainly affected by population density, rainfall, runoff, hydrodynamic force and wind direction. At a more macroscopic level, the distribution of microplastics was similar to that of algal blooms, TN and TP to some extent, especially in the early stage of algal bloom outbreaks, and the algal density was significantly positively correlated with the flux of microplastics into the lake. Microplastics, as carriers of algae, could promote the growth of algae blooms in the early stage, while in the later stage, microplastics and algal blooms could aggregate and coprecipitate through adsorption or adhesion and then inhibit the growth of algae.					liu, xiaohui/ABF-1884-2021														0169-7722	1873-6009				JUN	2022	248								104028	10.1016/j.jconhyd.2022.104028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconhyd.2022.104028		MAY 2022						35640420					WOS:000813472800007

However, identification and quantification of potential contributions of allochthonous inputs and physicochemical habitat shifts to variations in phytoplankton communities remain challenging. The present study addresses this issue with a study of the Water Diversion from the Yangtze River to Lake Taihu in China. To explore the effects and contributions of seasonal water diversion activities on lacustrine phytoplankton communities, the comparative analysis was conducted to compare the biotic and abiotic variables between the water diversion and non-diversion periods in different seasons. The results showed that seasonal water diversion activities, in addition to significantly reducing organic pollutant concentrations, definitely increased the average concentrations of nitrate and phosphorus in the Gonghu Bay. Compared with the results in the Gonghu Bay on the non-diversion days, phytoplankton diversities increased and the community compositions were altered, with the Bacillariophyta species and non-Microcystis Cyanophyta species dominating in the Gonghu Bay on the water diversion days in different seasons. The venn diagram analysis showed that the highest potential contribution of the allochthonous species to the increase in phytoplankton diversity in the Gonghu Bay on the water diversion days was about 15.8%. The physicochemical habitat disturbance induced by the water diversion contributed about 12% to 31.3% of the phytoplankton diversity and 23.3% to 31.3% of the phytoplankton community variations in the Gonghu Bay. The allochthonous phytoplankton species may contribute directly to the lacustrine phytoplankton community variations. However, due to the high loads of nutrients from inflow rivers, positive effects of water diversion shaping the phytoplankton communities were always short-term. Pollutant control and multi-objective operation, considering flood control, water supply, and water environment improvement, are indispensable for the long-term management of water diversion projects.

This study assessed the occurrence and mass flows of CECs in Sweden's three largest lakes and 24 associated rivers. The occurrence and distribution of 105 CECs was investigated, comprising 71 pharmaceuticals, 13 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), eight industrial chemicals, four personal care products (PCPs), three parabens, two pesticides, and four other CECs (mostly anthropogenic markers). This is the first systematic study of CECs in Sweden's main lakes and one of the first to report environmental concentrations of the industrial chemicals tributyl citrate acetate and 2,2 '-dimorpholinyldiethyl-ether. The Sigma CEC concentration was generally higher in river water (31-5200 ng/L; median 440 ng/L) than in lake water (36-900 ng/L; median 190 ng/L). At urban lake sites, seasonal variations were observed for PCPs and parabens, and also for antihistamines, antidiabetics, antineoplastic agents, antibiotics, and fungicides. The median mass CEC load in river water was 180 g/day (range 4.0-4300 g/day), with a total mass load of 5000 g/day to Lake Vanern, 510 g/day to Lake Vattern, and 5600 g/day to Lake Malaren. All three lakes are used as drinking water reservoirs, so further investigations of the impact of CECs on the ecosystem and human health are needed.

The DOM fluorescence components were identified as protein-like C1, microbial humic-like C2, and terrestrial humic-like C3. The highest total fluorescence intensity (F-T) of DOM in sediments during the incubation stage is due to the decomposition and degradation of cyanobacteria remains. The lowest humification of DOM and the highest proportion of C1 in waters during the initial cyanobacterial growth indicate that fresh algae are the main source. The highest molecular weight of DOM and F-T of the C2 in sediments during cyanobacterial outbreaks indicate the concurrent deposition of undegraded cyanobacterial remains and microbial degradation. The components of DOM are affected mainly by the dissolved total phosphorus in waters, while the temperature drives the annual cycle of cyanobacteria. The decreasing C1 in sediments and increasing nutrients in waters from the cyanobacterial incubation to outbreak indicate that mineralization of algal organic matter contributes importantly to the release of internal nutrients, with the strongest release of phosphorus observed during the early growth of cyanobacteria. The humic-like C2 and C3 components could also affect the dynamics of internal phosphorus through the formation of organic colloids and organic-norganic ligands. The results show that the degradation of DOM leads to nutrients release and thus supports the continuous growth of cyanobacteria in eutrophic Lake Chaohu.

Despite this, little is known about the identity and ecology of functionally significant lake bacteria. Molecular studies have identified many abundant lake bacteria, but there is a large variation in the taxonomic or phylogenetic breadths among the methods used for this exploration. Because of this, an inconsistent and overlapping naming structure has developed for freshwater bacteria, creating a significant obstacle to identifying coherent ecological traits among these groups. A discourse that unites the field is sorely needed. Here we present a new freshwater lake phylogeny constructed from all published 16S rRNA gene sequences from lake epilimnia and propose a unifying vocabulary to discuss freshwater taxa. With this new vocabulary in place, we review the current information on the ecology, ecophysiology, and distribution of lake bacteria and highlight newly identified phylotypes. In the second part of our review, we conduct meta-analyses on the compiled data, identifying distribution patterns for bacterial phylotypes among biomes and across environmental gradients in lakes. We conclude by emphasizing the role that this review can play in providing a coherent framework for future studies.					; McMahon, Katherine/I-3651-2012; Jones, Stuart/ABD-5264-2021; Eiler, Alexander/V-9220-2017	Jones, Stuart/0000-0003-4740-6721; McMahon, Katherine D./0000-0002-7038-026X; Eiler, Alexander/0000-0001-9916-9567													1092-2172	1098-5557				MAR	2011	75	1					14	49		10.1128/MMBR.00028-10	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/MMBR.00028-10								21372319					WOS:000288006400001

As the consequences of increased extreme weather related to climate change, Pakistan experiences severe floods almost every year. This study aims to explore and analysis the actual inundated situation, magnitude, the possible causes of the 2022 devastating floods, and future trends. We presented an enhanced nationwide flood mapping method and compared with other pixel-based image processing techniques including active contours and change detection. These algorithms were applied to Sentinel-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery (10 m spatial resolution) with various land types and inundation scenarios in Pakistan, and were evaluated using other reference flood products. Accuracy evaluation analysis demonstrated that our algorithm has high robustness and accuracy, with the overall accuracy (OA) higher than 0.83 and critical success index (CSI) up to 0.91, and is suitable for automated flood monitoring in near real time. Nearly one-third of the lands were flooded in 2022, and more than half were inundated croplands. Punjab and Sindh provinces were the most severely affected regions, with the proportions of inundated area in 2022 (21.26% and 20.55%) nearly twice of that in 2010 (11.40% and 12.70%), indicating an intensified flooding trend. Analysis of possible influential factors showed that the intense and cumulative rainfall during the monsoon season (June to August) was the major cause of the 2022 flood event. Although the snow melted rapidly in June (the average change in snow depth is similar to 10 mm), the overall ablation contributed insignificant amount to the flood water. The glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) induced by abnormal April-May heatwave provide water flowed into the tributaries of the Indus River, but are difficult to spread for thousands of kilometers from mountains to the plain downstream. The combination of the intrinsic arid climate and extreme floods exacerbate the already severe situation.

J	Kordi, F; Yousefi, H				Kordi, Fatemeh; Yousefi, Hossein			Crop classification based on phenology information by using time series of optical and synthetic-aperture radar images	REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT												Crop classification provides essential information for ensuring global food security, allowing early crop monitoring practices and water irrigation management. Despite of high importance of sat-ellite imagery in identifying agricultural products, a significant number of optical images could become inaccessible due to cloud cover, which makes mapping agricultural products difficult. Therefore, the provision of up-to-date data integration methods and the availability of time series of optical and radar images such as Sentinel-1 data have provided new opportunities for mapping agricultural products with high spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, the results of classification accuracy were investigated based on the phenology of agricultural products and using time series of Landsat 8, Sentinel-1 and the digital elevation model (DEM). To do so, the key phenological parameters of the products such as start of season, length of season and end of season were first extracted using time series of the NDVI vegetation index calculated from the optical images and the TIMESAT model. Then, based on vegetation phenology of crops using optical (Landsat-8) and radar (Sentinel-1) time series data along with Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to increase the accuracy of classification, we applied the support vector machine method based on machine learning. The performance of this model was investigated on a part of Mian-doab catchment basin located in the catchment of Lake Urmia in the northwest of Iran. Also, five major agricultural products of the study area, such as alfalfa, wheat, sugar beet, apple and grape were identified with overall accuracy of 89% using the support vector machine algorithm. Classification results demonstrated that using a combination of different data (overall accuracy (OA) = 89%, Kappa = 0.78) were more accurate than the only single-sensor inputs (OA = 77%, Kappa = 0.64), and when differences between crop types were largest, classification performance increased throughout the season until July.

Here, ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy and three-dimensional fluorescence (EEM) spectroscopy were combined to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of DOM in Nanfei River flowing into Chaohu Lake in China. 24 water samples and 24 surface sediments samples (including dry-to-wet transition season and wet season in 2018) were collected from different types of outlets. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) model and correlation analysis were conducted to identify the primary sources of DOM. Two humic-like components (C1 235-250 nm/385-430 nm and C3 255-270 nm/455-510 nm) and one tryptophan-like component (C2 270-290 nm/320-350 nm) were effectively identified by PARAFAC model. The results showed DOM concentration presented significant spatiotemporal variations. The concentration was much lower in water than in surface sediments in dry-to-wet transition season, but higher in the wet season. Fluorescence index (FL), biological index (BIX) and humification index (HIX) were used to judge characteristic of DOM origination. These indexes indicated that, DOM in Nanfei River had both the characteristics of humus and autogenous, but neogene autogenic feature was stronger, which was largely due to mixture of water, resuspension and desorption of DOM in sediments and photochemical degradation. In addition, the characteristic parameter of molecular mass of DOM (the values of M) had an obvious linear relationship with the fluorescence intensity ratio of fulvic acid-like to humic acid-like (C1/C3), indicating that macromolecular substances could be removed by adding or improving membrane treatment. These provided technical support for improving quality and comprehensive treatment of drinking water sources. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

David			Continued decrease of open surface water body area in Oklahoma during 1984-2015	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Oklahoma contains the largest number of manmade lakes and reservoirs in the United States. Despite the importance of these open surface water bodies to public water supply, agriculture, thermoelectric power, tourism and recreation, it is unclear how these water bodies have responded to climate change and anthropogenic water exploitation in past decades. In this study, we used all available Landsat 5 and 7 images (16,000 scenes) from 1984 through 2015 and a water index-and pixel-based approach to analyze the spatial-temporal variability of open surface water bodies and its relationship with climate and water exploitation. Specifically, the areas and numbers of four water body extents (the maximum, year-long, seasonal, and average extents) were analyzed to capture variations in water body area and number. Statistically significant downward trends were found in the maximum, year-long, and annual average water body areas from 1984 through 2015. Furthermore, these decreases were mainly attributed to the continued shrinking of large water bodies (> 1 km(2)). There were also significant decreases in maximum and year-long water body numbers, which suggested that some of the water bodies were vanishing year by year. However, remarkable inter-annual variations of water body area and number were also found. Both water body area and number were positively related to precipitation, and negatively related to temperature. Surface water withdrawals mainly influenced the year-long water bodies. The smaller water bodies have a higher risk of drying under a drier climate, which suggests that small water bodies are more vulnerable under climate-warming senarios. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It is highly dependent on groundwater resources to meet the domestic, industrial, and agricultural water demand. Position of water samples on the modified Gibbs diagram demonstrates that the interaction with silicates and the increase in direct cation exchange are responsible for the increased salinity of groundwater. Based on entropy theory, the decreasing order of importance of variables in controlling groundwater chemistry is Fe > As > Ba > Hg > NO2 > Pb > K > Cl > Na > Mg > SO4 > NO3 > HCO3 > Ca. The results of entropy weighted water quality index (EWWQI) calculation show that about 34 and 32% of 206 samples in the wet and dry seasons, respectively, are classified as extremely poor quality (ranks 4 and 5). Approximately 60 and 55% of 206 samples in wet and dry seasons, respectively, have excellent, good, and medium quality (ranks 1, 2, and 3). The non-carcinogenic human health risk (NHHR) from intake and dermal contact pathways using deterministic approach show that 36 and 17 samples in both seasons are not suitable for drinking by children. Furthermore, 9 and 2 samples are not suitable for drinking by adults. The results show that children are more vulnerable than adults to these health risks. The non-carcinogenic risks through dermal contact were negligible.

Impacts of climate change on submerged and emergent wetland plants	AQUATIC BOTANY												Submerged and emergent wetland plant communities are evaluated for their response to global climate change (GCC), focusing on seagrasses, submerged freshwater plants, tidal marsh plants, freshwater marsh plants and mangroves. Similarities and differences are assessed in plant community responses to temperature increase, CO2 increase, greater UV-B exposure, sea level rise and other expected environmental alterations associated with GCC. Responses to most climate change variables are more similar within submerged plant communities, marine or freshwater, than between submerged vs. emergent plant communities. The submerged plants are most affected by temperature increases and indirect impacts on water clarity. Emergent plant communities (marshes and mangroves) respond most directly to climate change related hydrological alterations. Wetland plant communities overall appear to be adversely impacted by all climate change variables, with the exception of increased CO2 in the atmosphere and the oceans, which in most cases increases photosynthesis. Effects of GCC on all these communities have already been seen with many others predicted, including: shifts in species composition, shifts in range and distribution, and declines in plant species richness. Other effects are associated with specific community types, e.g., salt marsh habitat lost to mangrove incursion, and decreases in submerged macrophyte coverage in lakes and estuaries, exacerbated by eutrophication. Sea level rise poses threats to all aquatic plant community types in the vicinity of the oceans, and changes in weather patterns and salinity will affect many. Overall, losses are likely in all these wetland plant communities yet their species can adapt to GCC to some degree if well managed and protected. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Hangzhou Bay and Qiantang Estuary region are facing unusual perturbation due to rapid development along the embayment in recent decades. This study evaluated the organic and inorganic pollutants in water, sediment, and from the muscles of higher trophic organisms (fish, crustacean, shellfish) during four different seasons (in 2018-2019) along the Qiantang Estuary and Hangzhou Bay region to assess the ecosystem health and potential hazard status. Dissolved inorganic phosphate and nitrogen were the major pollutants in this area, which led to severe eutrophication throughout the study period. Eutrophication signals coincided well with the phytoplankton abundance, which revels the control of nutrient enrichment on the spatio-temporal distribution of phytoplankton. Food availability, along with salinity and temperature, drives the zooplankton population distribution. Heavy metals were not the issue of water quality as their concentrations meet the national and international baseline standards. However, in the sediments, Copper (Cu) and Arsenic (As) concentrations were higher than the baseline value. Towards the northwestern part of the Qiantang Estuary, the overall potential risk index of sediment with higher Cadmium (Cd) and Mercury (Hg) depicted delicate condition with moderate risk for the sediment contamination. The As concentration in fishes was close to the baseline standards limit irrespective of low As values within water and sediments. The higher concentrations of Zinc (Zn) and As in shellfish muscles, whereas other metals were within the limit of baseline standard in all the organisms. However, the hazard analysis (Targeted hazard quotient, THQ) values for the seafood consumption to human health indicates the potentially threatening consequences of shellfish and crustacean consumption on human health.

J	Woods, T; Kaz, A; Giam, X				Woods, Taylor; Kaz, Anna; Giam, Xingli			Phenology in freshwaters: a review and recommendations for future research	ECOGRAPHY												Phenology changes are increasingly recognized as a common response of species to ongoing global change. Phenology can be influenced by environmental cues that impact the initiation or duration of life history events as well as intrinsic organismal traits that may affect how different species respond to such environmental cues. Despite the importance of phenology for biodiversity conservation as demonstrated by terrestrial and marine research, freshwater phenology is understudied. Therefore, we conducted a literature review on freshwater phenology research to summarize the spatial, taxonomic and temporal biases of studies; as well as relationships between phenology metrics, environmental cues and intrinsic species traits studied in these systems. We find that phenology research in freshwaters may be limited by a lack of long-term time-series data, especially in lotic habitats. Phenology metrics studied differed between lotic and lentic habitats, with limnological research focused on planktonic population growth whereas macroinvertebrate emergence and fish spawning seasons are the most frequently studied aspects of phenology in streams and rivers. Across habitats, temperature is the most investigated environmental cue, with additional research attention to resources and hydrology in influencing phenology events in lentic and lotic environments, respectively. Knowledge gaps in contemporary freshwater phenology research include relationships between phenology and environmental cues in tropical systems, understanding of non-salmonid fish phenology and testing hypotheses related to intrinsic traits. We recommend that future research broaden the biological, spatial and temporal scales of phenology studies in these systems, and make use of novel data sources, methods and technologies to address contemporary research gaps.

A Quantitative Hydrological Climate Classification Evaluated With Independent Streamflow Data	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Classification is essential in the study of natural systems, yet hydrology has no formal way to structure the climatic forcing that underlies hydrologic response. Various climate classification systems can be borrowed from other disciplines but these are based on different organizing principles than a hydrological classification might need. This work presents a hydrologically informed way to quantify global climates, explicitly addressing the shortcomings in earlier climate classifications. In this work, causal factors (climate) and hydrologic response (streamflow) are separated, meaning that our classification scheme is based only on climatic information and can be evaluated with independent streamflow data. Using gridded global climate data, we calculate three dimensionless indices per grid cell, describing annual aridity, aridity seasonality, and precipitation-as-snow. We use these indices to create several climate groups and define the membership degree of 1,103 catchments to each of the climate groups, based on each catchment's climate. Streamflow patterns within each group tend to be similar, and tend to be different between groups. Visual comparison of flow regimes and Wilcoxon two-sample statistical tests on 16 streamflow signatures show that this index-based approach is more effective than the often-used Koppen-Geiger classification for grouping hydrologically similar catchments. Climate forcing exerts a strong control on typical hydrologic response and we show that at the global scale both change gradually in space. We argue that hydrologists should consider the hydroclimate as a continuous spectrum defined by the three climate indices, on which all catchments are positioned and show examples of this in a regionalization context.					; Freer, Jim/C-7335-2009; Woods, Ross/C-6696-2013; Knoben, Wouter/IUM-2769-2023	Knoben, Wouter/0000-0001-8301-3787; Freer, Jim/0000-0001-6388-7890; Woods, Ross/0000-0002-5732-5979; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				JUL	2018	54	7					5088	5109		10.1029/2018WR022913	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018WR022913													WOS:000442502100051

However, human activities in lakes and their watersheds may have direct and indirect impacts on aquatic optical properties. Therefore, identifying key drivers that can be controlled (human) from those that cannot (climate) represents an important objective. In the present study, we develop an algorithm to estimate the concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in Lake Hongze (the fourth largest freshwater lake in China) using MODIS/Aqua images with concurrent data collected from six cruise surveys. The algorithm resulted in root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 7.64-7.86 mg/L for SPM ranging from 10 to 80 mg/L. The algorithm was applied to 1602 cloud-free MODIS/Aqua images from 2002 to 2015. Our results show: (1) inter-annual and seasonal variations of SPM concentrations in lake Hongze are divided into two distinct periods between 2002 and 2011 and 2012-2015, with the transition associated to intensive dredging activities that were initiated in 2012. (2) SPM concentrations exhibit four typical patterns of spatial distribution which depend on local meteorological (wind speed and wind direction) and hydrological conditions (catchment rainfall and Huai River flowrate). Based on these results, a new spatial zoning of the lake is derived to support government and agency monitoring. The study shows additive and synergistic effects of climate change and human activities on SPM concentrations over short and long timescales and the possibility to monitor these changes by remote sensing in shallow optically complex lakes.

Sian; Carvalho, Laurence			Nitrogen and phosphorus limitation and the management of small productive lakes	INLAND WATERS												Many inland waters are enriched with nutrients, causing deleterious effects to their ecology and the benefits they provide for society, but their effective management first requires identification of the nutrient(s) that limit algal production. Concentrations of nutrients and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) were used to assess nutrient limitation seasonally at 17 meres over 2 time periods: historic (2005-2009; 1995-1998 at one site) and contemporary (2014-2018). Different approaches were used to assess nutrient limitation because they reflect different aspects of nutrient availability and their conversion into biomass. In the historic period, 3 meres were phosphorus (P) limited, 3 nitrogen (N) limited, 5 co-limited; the remaining 6 meres were not nutrient limited. For this period, ecological status assessed using phytoplankton Chl-a was only at good or high ecological status (sensu the Water Framework Directive) at 2 sites. The contemporary period was slightly improved, with 4 sites at good status. At the sites that failed to meet good ecological status, the required reduction in P concentration was least in P-limited sites and, conversely, the reduction in N was least in N-limited sites, suggesting that remediation by nutrient reduction would be most efficient if it was targeted using site-specific information. Even in primarily P-limited sites, once input of P has been reduced, further ecological benefit of reducing N at targeted sites should be explored.

However, there are still insufficient studies on the interannual evolution of nitrogen-nitrate, source and its impact on the environment and human health in the large fresh water lake. In this study, 248 samplings were collected in Poyang Lake from 2013 to 2018, multi-methods (mathematical statistics method, grey correlation analysis, person correlation analysis and human health risk assessment) to investigate the spatiotemporal variations, impact factors and potential health risks of NO2--N, NO3--N and NH4+-N. The results showed that the middle region had the highest NO2 - concentration (mean 0.04 mu g/l), the northern region had the highest NO3- concentration (mean 1.12 mg/l), and the southern region had the highest NH4+ concentration (mean 0.48 mg/l). For NO3- and NH4+ , the concentration was higher than in the wet season. While the concentration of NO2- had the reverse trend. Grey correlation analysis and person correlation analysis results indicate that nitrogen fertilizer, waste water, pH, CODMn and temperature were main factors affecting the nitrogen concentration in Poyang Lake. Health risk assess-ment results revealed that potential hazards in the study area were acceptable (HR < 1). NO3- provided the highest health risks, and oral ingestion is the major source of local nitrogen health risk. Those results can provide the reference for developing the treatment methods of the international large freshwater lake.

However, this has been a scientific challenge due to the limited availability of continuous, long-term reservoir operation records at large scales, and a process-based modeling tool to accurately depict reservoirs as part of the terrestrial water cycle is still lacking. Here, we develop a continental-scale land surface-hydrologic model over the mainland China by explicitly representing 3,547 reservoirs in the model with a calibration-free conceptual operation scheme for ungauged reservoirs and a hydrodynamically based two-way coupled scheme. The model is spatially calibrated and then extensively validated against streamflow observations, reservoir storage observations and GRACE-based terrestrial water storage anomalies. A 30-year simulation is then performed to quantify the seasonal dynamics of China's reservoir water storage (RWS) and its role in China's terrestrial water storage (TWS) over recent decades. We estimate that, over a seasonal cycle, China's RWS variation is 15%, 16%, and 25% of TWS variation during 1981-1990, 1991-2000, and 2001-2010, respectively, and one-fifth of China's reservoir capacity are effectively used annually. In most regions, reservoirs play a growing role in modulating the water cycle over time. Despite that, an estimated 80 million people have faced increasing water resources challenges in the past decades due to the significantly weakened reservoir regulation of the water cycle. Our approaches and findings could help the government better address the water security challenges under environmental changes.

In this study, the occurrence, spatial distribution, potential sources, partitioning character and potential risks of OPEs in the surface water and sediment collected from Taihu Lake were investigated. The concentrations of Sigma 12 OPEs varied from 1.0 x 10(2) to 1.7 x 10(3) ng/L for the surface water and from 8.1 to 4.2 x 10(2) ng/g dw for the sediment. Trimethyl phosphate (TEP) was the predominant congener in the surface water, while Tris(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (TEHP) in the sediment. Positive correlations between OPEs indicated that they may have the same sources and/or similar environmental behavior. The pseudo-partitioning values of OPEs ranged from 0.59 to 6.5 x 10(4) L/kg. TEHP has the highest pseudo-partitioning coefficient, which indicated that TEHP inclined to be enriched in the sediment in Taihu Lake. Risk assessment (RQ) showed that individual OPEs in the surface water and sediment posed no/low risk to aquatic organisms, except 2-Ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP) (moderate risk) in water.

The increase in organic matter (OM) in both macrophyte-dominated areas (MDAs) and algaedominated areas (ADAs) has exacerbated these problems. Most OM in water is concentrated as suspended particulate matter (SPM), which eventually migrates to the sediment. However, the detailed origins and fates of OM in water-SPM-sediment systems with coexisting MDAs and ADAs remain unclear. Therefore, in this study, we conducted monthly field investigations in Lake Taihu, focusing on OM-migration patterns in an MDA and an ADA. The C/N mass ratios, 813C contents, and OM compositions of the water, SPM, and sediment were analyzed. Our findings revealed that autochthonous sources of OM prevailed in water, whereas terrestrial sources prevailed in SPM and sediment. Rapid decomposition processes of microbial- and algae-derived dissolved OM were discovered along the water-SPM-sediment pathways in both areas. A trend towards a shift from macrophytes to algae in the MDA was also discovered. Overall, the entire lake underwent a burial process of OM in both types of areas, with mineralization mostly occurring during the algal-bloom seasons and more strongly in the ADA. Furthermore, we deduced that a decrease in the OM-burial rate, but an increase in the mineralization rate, might occur after a complete shift from a macrophyte- to an algae-dominated status. Such a shift might change the carbon-cycle process in eutrophic shallow lakes and should be given more attention in future research.

In this study, the sediment profiles in the riparian and submerged areas from Filling to Zigui in the middle-low TGR mainstream were collected to investigate the stratified distribution of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) and assess their contamination and potential eco-risk. The results showed that the concentrations of these metals in the riparian sediments did not present a marked spatial trend except the concentrations of Cd that increased towards the dam. However, the metal concentrations (except Cd) in the submerged sediments were generally higher near the dam. The concentrations of heavy metals in the riparian sediments did not show marked vertical variation, while in the submerged sediments they fluctuated dramatically with depth, indicating the metal accumulation processes in last few years. Sediment grain sizes as an indicator of hydrodynamic regimes dominated the vertical distribution of heavy metals over organic matters and Fe/Mn oxide/hydroxides. The sediments from both riparian and submerged areas of the TGR were contaminated by anthropogenic metals of Cd, Cu and Pb that were mainly from the ore mining, fossil fuel combustion, agricultural pollution and atmospheric deposition. Cadmium was a major metal pollutant in the sediments with a high contamination and potential eco-risk level. The results of this study indicate that the sorting of sediments with the anti-seasonal flow regulation determines the spatial and temporal distribution of heavy metal contamination in the sediments, and the impoundment stages of the TGR in history regulate the accumulation processes of the metals.

The task of assessing and selecting potential Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) candidate sections, a required part of the process in seeking formalisation of the term, is now being actively pursued. Here, we review the suitability of different stratified palaeoenvironmental settings and facies as potential hosts for a candidate GSSP and auxiliary sections, and the relevant stratigraphical markers for correlation. Published examples are evaluated for their strengths and weaknesses in this respect. A marked upturn in abundance of radioisotopes of Pu-239 or C-14, approximately in 1952 and 1954 CE respectively, broadly coincident with a downturn in delta C-13 values, is applicable across most environments. Principal palaeoenvironments examined include: settings associated with accumulations of anthropogenic material, marine anoxic basins, coral reefs, estuaries and deltas, lakes at various latitudes, peat bogs, snow/ice layers, speleothems and trees. Together, many of these geographically diverse palaeoenvironments offer annual/subannual laminae that can be counted and independently dated radiometrically (e.g. by Pb-210). Examples of possible sections offer the possibility of correlation with annual/seasonal resolution. From among such examples, a small number of potentially representative sites require the acquisition of more systematic and comprehensive datasets, with correlation established between sections, to allow selection of a candidate GSSP and auxiliary stratotypes.

High-resolution monitoring of Himalayan glacier dynamics using unmanned aerial vehicles	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Himalayan glacier tongues are commonly debris covered and they are an important source of melt water. However, they remain relatively unstudied because of the inaccessibility of the terrain and the difficulties in field work caused by the thick debris mantles. Observations of debris-covered glaciers are therefore scarce and airborne remote sensing may bridge the gap between scarce field observations and coarse resolution space-borne remote sensing. In this study we deploy an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) before and after the melt and monsoon season (May and October 2013) over the debris-covered tongue of the Lirung Glacier in Nepal. Based on stereo-imaging and the structure for motion algorithm we derive highly detailed ortho-mosaics and digital elevation models (DEMs), which we geometrically correct using differential GPS observations collected in the field. Based on DEM differencing and manual feature tracking we derive the mass loss and the surface velocity of the glacier at a high spatial accuracy. On average, mass loss is limited and the surface velocity is very small. However, the spatial variability of melt rates is very high, and' ice cliffs and supra-glacial ponds show mass losses that can be an order of magnitude higher than the average. We suggest that future research should focus on the interaction between supra-glacial ponds, ice cliffs and englacial hydrology to further understand the dynamics of debris-covered glaciers. Finally, we conclude that UAV deployment has large potential in glaciology and it may revolutionize methods currently applied in studying glacier surface features.

There clearly is a pressing need to understand temporal and spatial variations of lakes at global and continental scales. The recent operation of Landsat 8 extends the unprecedented Landsat record to over 40 years, allowing long-term, large-scale lake dynamics mapping at high resolutions. Using our circa 2000 lake product derived from Landsat 7 images as a reference, this research produces a circa-2015 map of representative lake extents and distributions, and addresses seasonal and inter-annual lake area variability using Landsat 8 images acquired in lake stable seasons at a continental scale. Oceania is chosen here as a case study as it contains a large group of salt lakes that exhibit high area variability and has the most intensive image coverage during the first 2.5-year operation of Landsat 8. Accordingly, this paper describes an adaptive algorithm to automate lake mapping for various surface conditions using images acquired during lake stable seasons and a compositing scheme in the vector domain to generate a representative continental mosaic of lake extents from multi-temporal mapping. Our results demonstrate that these strategies and methods produce a highly reliable and representative composite of highly-variable lake extents across Oceania, and are potentially applicable to other large-scale lake mapping projects using multi-temporal data.

J	Li, Y; Niu, ZG				Li, Yang; Niu, Zhenguo			Systematic method for mapping fine-resolution water cover types in China based on time series Sentinel-1 and 2 images	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Humans have been transforming natural surface water bodies into various types of artificial water cover to meet the growing demand for food, energy, and flood protection in recent decades. These changes have exerted cumulative impacts on the water cycle, environment, and ecology. Although the geographical distribution of and changes in water cover types is essential to understanding these changes, timely and accurate acquisition and updating are difficult to accomplish, mainly because of the lack of a practical and effective classification method, especially at the global and national scales. From the perspective of water cover, first we suggest a comprehensive water cover classification system in terms of water sources, water body shapes, and water usage, including rivers, reservoirs, lakes, agricultural ponds, seasonal wetlands, and rice fields. An automatic and operational classification method based on shape features and flooding frequency (AuCoSaFF) is developed accordingly. Then, we employ this method to produce an unprecedented 10-meter spatial resolution China Water Cover Map (CWaC) using time series Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images acquired in 2020 and obtained from the Google Earth Engine. The validation shows that this dataset has an overall accuracy of 86% and a kappa coefficient of 0.83. The CWaC is the first thematic mapping on water cover types over all of China, and it provides information on the complete water cover types. It indicates that China's water cover area is 240,383 km(2 ) of which natural water accounts for 56.3%. China's water bodies are mainly distributed in Heilongjiang, Tibet, and Qinghai provinces. A comparison with seven other water-related data products highlights the advantages of the AuCoSaFF in acquiring high spatial and temporal resolution information about the complete water cover types at large scales. The shape-based and inundation frequency-based automatic method underlines the potentials of fast water cover type mapping at large scales using existing water datasets. We also anticipate that this freely available dataset will provide evidence of the states of and changes in wetlands, help to improve our understanding of human influences on the hydrologic cycle, and inform water-management decision-making.					; Niu, Zhenguo/L-4829-2016	Li, Yang/0000-0002-3118-5736; 													1569-8432	1872-826X				FEB	2022	106								102656	10.1016/j.jag.2021.102656	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2021.102656													WOS:000741372800003

Environmental conditions such as high pH, light, temperature, and nutrients favour cyanobacterial growth which results in algal bloom formations. Cyanobacteria blooms may be toxic or non-toxic. Thus, the consumption of edible cyanobacteria such as spirulina may reduce the risks of cataracts and age-related muscular degeneration. Sulphate polysaccharides within some cyanobacteria have been shown to exhibit antitumor, anti-mutagenic, anti-inflammatory, antiviral activity against certain viruses and bacteria. There are many ways in which humans may be exposed to cyanobacteria and their cyanotoxins, with the most common route being eating and drinking of contaminated food and water, respectively. The current paper reviews cyanotoxin effects produced by cyanobacteria particularly in water and food, and its potential implications for human health. We further examine the quality of water used during food processing and developing a theoretical framework on cyanobacteria contamination of food. Concentrations of microcystin have been reported in crops and grain in Brazil, New Zealand and China. Microcystin concentrations of 8.31, 0.78 and 22 mu g/kg were detected in lettuce, rape (Brassicas) and rice, respectively. Therefore, cyanotoxin transfers can occur through application of cyanobacteria contaminated water during food production.					; Gumbo, Jabulani/K-7183-2012; Jideani, Afam/T-5304-2018; Gumbo, Jabulani Ray/K-7183-2012	Mutoti, Mulalo/0000-0003-1874-7244; Gumbo, Jabulani Ray/0000-0001-8967-3858; Jideani, Afam Israel Obiefuna/0000-0002-9122-8697													1474-7065	1873-5193				FEB	2022	125								103101	10.1016/j.pce.2021.103101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pce.2021.103101													WOS:000758708000002

However, the impacts of biochar on greenhouse gases from paddy field have not been investigated under controlled irrigation (CI). Field experiments were conducted during 2016-2017 to determine the effect of biochar application combined with controlled irrigation on rice yield and methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from paddy fields in the Taihu Lake Region of China. Four treatments (0 t ha(-1) biochar + CI, 20 t ha(-1) biochar + CI, 40 t ha(-1) biochar + CI, and 40 t ha(-1) biochar + flooding irrigation (FI), named CA, CB, CC and FC, respectively) were designed in this study. The results showed that the effect of biochar application on greenhouse gases emissions from paddy fields under controlled irrigation had significant interannual differences. In the first season, CC decreased the global warming potential(GWP) of CH4 and N2O emission, and the CB increased the GWP of CH4 and N2O emission compared to CA, but these differences were not significant. For the second season, CB and CC decreased the GWP of CH4 and N2O emission by 35.7% and 21.5% significantly compared to CA due to the significant mitigation of CH4 and N2O emission. Biochar application significantly increased CH4 emission and decreased N2O emission from paddy fields under flooding irrigation compared to controlled irrigation (CC), which led to the FC's GWP was 1.70 and 5.47 times higher than CC's in the first and second season. In addition, biochar application increased soil organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon and total nitrogen contents of paddy fields under controlled irrigation. And CB and CC increased rice yield by 16.7% and 24.3% and irrigation water productivity by 26.1% and 30.8% compared with CA (mean of two seasons). These results suggest that 20 and 40 t ha(-1) biochar can be utilized under controlled irrigation not only for mitigation of CH4 and N2O emission but also to increase rice yield, soil fertility and irrigation water productivity. Therefore, the combination of biochar amendment and controlled irrigation might be a good option for mitigating greenhouse gases emission and realizing the sustainable utilization of soil and water resources of paddy fields in the Taihu Lake Region of China.					, xujunzeng/AGY-0464-2022; Sun, Xiao/KBA-9844-2024; Jiang, Zewei/AAX-6910-2021; Yang, Shihong/AAM-2188-2020	Jiang, Zewei/0000-0001-6077-5244; Xu, Junzeng/0000-0003-1467-7883; 													1352-2310	1873-2844				MAR 1	2019	200						69	77		10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.12.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.12.003													WOS:000458225500008

Widespread distribution of supraglacial lakes around the margin of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Supraglacial lakes are important to ice sheet mass balance because their development and drainage has been linked to changes in ice flow velocity and ice shelf disintegration. However, little is known about their distribution on the world's largest ice sheet in East Antarctica. Here, we use similar to 5 million km(2) of high-resolution satellite imagery to identify >65,000 lakes (>1,300 km(2)) that formed around the peak of the melt season in January 2017. Lakes occur in most marginal areas where they typically develop at low elevations (<100 m) and on low surface slopes (<1 degrees), but they can exist 500 km inland and at elevations >1500 m. We find that lakes often cluster a few kilometres down-ice from grounding lines and similar to 60% (>80% by area) develop on ice shelves, including some potentially vulnerable to collapse driven by lake-induced hydro-fracturing. This suggests that parts of the ice sheet may be highly sensitive to climate warming.

Phytoplankton and zooplankton are integral components which play indispensable parts in the structure and ecological service function of water bodies. However, few studies were made on how zooplankton and phytoplankton community may respond simultaneously to change of circumstance and their mutual relationship. Therefore, we researched synchronously the phytoplankton communities as well as zooplankton communities based on monthly monitoring data from September 2011 to August 2012 in heavily polluted areas and researched their responses to variation in environmental parameters and their mutual relationship. As indicated by Time-lag analysis (TLA), the long-term dynamics of phytoplankton and zooplankton were undergoing directional variations, what's more, there exists significant seasonal variations of phytoplankton and zooplankton communities as indicated by Non-Metric Multidimensional scaling (NMDS) methods. Also, Redundancy Analysis (RDA) demonstrated that environmental indicators together accounted for 25.6% and 50.1% variance of phytoplankton and zooplankton, respectively, indicating that environmental variations affected significantly on the temporal dynamics of phytoplankton as well as zooplankton communities. What's more, variance partioning suggested that the major environmental factors influencing variation structures of zooplankton communities were water temperature, concentration of nitrogen, revealing the dominating driving mechanism which shaped the communities of zooplankton. It was also found that there was significant synchronization between zooplankton biomass and phytoplankton biomass (expressed as Chl-a concentration), which suggested that zooplankton respond to changes in dynamic structure of phytoplankton community and can initiate a decrease in phytoplankton biomass through grazing in a few months.

Although it is generally agreed upon that the use of multiple conservation practices ("stacking") will lead to greater improvements to water quality, this may not be cost effective to farmers, reducing the likelihood of adoption. At present, wholesale recommendations of conservation practices are given; however, the application of specific conservation practices in certain environments (e.g., no-till with surface application, cover crops) may not be effective and can even lead to unintended consequences. In this paper, we present the Lake Erie watershed as a case study. The Lake Erie watershed contains regions with unique physical geographies that include differences in climate, soil, topography, and land use, which have implications for both P transport from agricultural fields and the efficacy of conservation practices in mitigating P losses. We define major regions within the Lake Erie watershed where common strategies for conservation practice implementation are appropriate, and we propose a five-step plan for bringing regionally tailored, adaptive, and cost-conscious conservation practice into watershed planning. Although this paper is specific to the Lake Erie watershed, our framework can be transferred across broader geographic regions to provide guidance for watershed planning.					; Brouwer, Roy/M-9437-2013; Macrae, Merrin/KPB-7902-2024; Jarvie, Helen/A-3054-2013; Reid, Keith/ABA-4114-2021	Kleinman, Peter/0000-0002-5093-3736; Brouwer, Roy/0000-0002-0525-2050; Macrae, Merrin/0000-0003-3296-3103; Reid, Keith/0000-0001-8346-3614													0047-2425	1537-2537				MAY	2021	50	3					529	546	1-18	10.1002/jeq2.20218	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jeq2.20218		MAY 2021						33742722					WOS:000646719500001

The continent holds the vast majority of Earth's fresh water, and blankets swathes of the Southern Hemisphere in ice. Reductions in the thickness and extent of floating ice shelves have disturbed inland ice, triggering retreat, acceleration and draw-down of marine-terminating glaciers. The waxing and waning of Antarctic sea ice is one of Earth's greatest seasonal habitat changes, and although the maximum extent of the sea ice has increased modestly since the 1970s, inter-annual variability is high, and there is evidence of longer-term decline in its extent.

Reduced light availability induced by eutrophication has dramatically affected the growth of submerged macrophytes and caused their rapid decline globally in lakes. Functional traits have usually been used to predict ecological processes and explain plant adaptation. Trait networks, which are constructed from a series of nodes (traits) and edges (trait-trait correlations), can reveal complex relationships among traits. Plant traits belonging to different organs are considered relevant for overall plant performance. Therefore, variation in trait network topology at the whole plant level can better reflect plant adaptation and response to environments than traditional methods, but the mechanisms underlying the decline of plants from a trait network perspective are not well understood.2. In this study, based on a 1-year manipulation experiment for Potamogeton maackianus cultured with four levels of light intensity, we constructed trait networks from 20 traits belonging to different organs.3. Our results showed that trait network connectivity decreases in harsh environments, probably due to increased trait modules responding independently to stress. Network connectivity was positively related to the plant relative growth rate (RGR), as high trait connectivity and coordination should be beneficial for plants to acquire and transport resources efficiently across the whole plant. Additionally, we found that specific stem length, leaf: root mass ratios and leaf total non-structural carbohydrates were hub traits with high connectivity. Hub traits expressed high phenotypic plasticity, had close links with plant growth and consistently held their higher importance within the network across light gradients or seasons.4. We found that low phenotypic integration in stressful environments may constrain plant growth, which can provide important implications for understanding plant adaptation strategies to low-light stress and even predicting community dynamics in the context of global environmental change.					; Su, Haojie/JVO-6993-2024	Rao, Qingyang/0000-0003-0365-7326; Su, Haojie/0000-0003-4780-1094													0269-8463	1365-2435				JUN	2023	37	6					1732	1746		10.1111/1365-2435.14327	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.14327		APR 2023											WOS:000979683700001

Spatiotemporal remote sensing of ecosystem change and causation across Alaska	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Contemporary climate change in Alaska has resulted in amplified rates of press and pulse disturbances that drive ecosystem change with significant consequences for socio-environmental systems. Despite the vulnerability of Arctic and boreal landscapes to change, little has been done to characterize landscape change and associated drivers across northern high-latitude ecosystems. Here we characterize the historical sensitivity of Alaska's ecosystems to environmental change and anthropogenic disturbances using expert knowledge, remote sensing data, and spatiotemporal analyses and modeling. Time-series analysis of moderate-and high-resolution imagery was used to characterize land- and water-surface dynamics across Alaska. Some 430,000 interpretations of ecological and geomorphological change were made using historical air photos and satellite imagery, and corroborate land-surface greening, browning, and wetness/moisture trend parameters derived from peak-growing season Landsat imagery acquired from 1984 to 2015. The time series of change metrics, together with climatic data and maps of landscape characteristics, were incorporated into a modeling framework for mapping and understanding of drivers of change throughout Alaska. According to our analysis, approximately 13% (similar to 174,000 +/- 8700 km(2)) of Alaska has experienced directional change in the last 32 years (+/- 95% confidence intervals). At the ecoregions level, substantial increases in remotely sensed vegetation productivity were most pronounced in western and northern foothills of Alaska, which is explained by vegetation growth associated with increasing air temperatures. Significant browning trends were largely the result of recent wildfires in interior Alaska, but browning trends are also driven by increases in evaporative demand and surface-water gains that have predominately occurred over warming permafrost landscapes. Increased rates of photosynthetic activity are associated with stabilization and recovery processes following wildfire, timber harvesting, insect damage, thermokarst, glacial retreat, and lake infilling and drainage events. Our results fill a critical gap in the understanding of historical and potential future trajectories of change in northern high-latitude regions.

Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms are a biological disturbance to Western Lake Erie bacterial communities	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Human activities are causing a global proliferation of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CHABs), yet we have limited understanding of how these events affect freshwater bacterial communities. Using weekly data from western Lake Erie in 2014, we investigated how the cyanobacterial community varied over space and time, and whether the bloom affected non-cyanobacterial (nc-bacterial) diversity and composition. Cyanobacterial community composition fluctuated dynamically during the bloom, but was dominated by Microcystis and Synechococcus OTUs. The bloom's progression revealed potential impacts to nc-bacterial diversity. Nc-bacterial evenness displayed linear, unimodal, or no response to algal pigment levels, depending on the taxonomic group. In addition, the bloom coincided with a large shift in nc-bacterial community composition. These shifts could be partitioned into components predicted by pH, chlorophyll a, temperature, and water mass movements. Actinobacteria OTUs showed particularly strong correlations to bloom dynamics. AcI-C OTUs became more abundant, while acI-A and acI-B OTUs declined during the bloom, providing evidence of niche partitioning at the sub-clade level. Thus, our observations in western Lake Erie support a link between CHABs and disturbances to bacterial community diversity and composition. Additionally, the short recovery of many taxa after the bloom indicates that bacterial communities may exhibit resilience to CHABs.					; Kling, George/C-7867-2015; Dick, Gregory/D-8901-2012; Cory, Rose/C-4198-2016	Berry, Michelle/0000-0002-0768-4906; Duhaime, Melissa/0000-0001-7884-5087; 													1462-2912	1462-2920				MAR	2017	19	3					1149	1162		10.1111/1462-2920.13640	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.13640								28026093					WOS:000397525100026
J	Dobinski, W				Dobinski, Wojciech			Permafrost active layer	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												This article discusses the properties and occurrence of an active layer (AL) in the near-surface of the lithosphere in glacial and periglacial environments. This layer shows a seasonal variability in temperature, as a result of the climate. The AL, as classically understood, seasonally thaws and freezes, while in glacial environments it usually only reaches 0 degrees C. The definition of AL is currently not consistent with the definition of permafrost, even though both concepts usually appear linked. For these terms to be comparable, both should be defined based on temperature variability and not exclusively on phase change. Thus, the AL would be described not only as the upper section of perennially frozen ground presenting seasonal thaw-freeze cycles (# 1) but as a layer presenting a seasonal variation in temperature (# 2). Classical active layer can be thawed to a depth of approximately 2-8 cm, the thickest AL reaches over 20 m. In the particularly favorable conditions AL might be completely absent with the permafrost beginning at the ground surface. In glacial and sub-marine permafrost environments, the AL includes a layer of liquid water that seasonally accompanies the permafrost. Glaciers and ice sheets are usually devoid of the classical AL. In both cases, the AL is usually horizontal, but in specific terrains such as sea shore cliffs or karst environments, the AL may have a vertical course and may even be reversed. Both AL and permafrost are common in other frozen bodies in the solar system, differing mainly in their thermal character.

Concentrations and variability of organophosphate esters, halogenated flame retardants, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers in indoor and outdoor air in Stockholm, Sweden	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												We investigated the concentrations and temporal variability of organophospate esters (OPEs), halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in indoor and outdoor urban air in Stockholm, Sweden over one year (2014-2015) period. The median concentrations of the three target chemical groups (OPEs, HFRs, PBDEs) were 1-2 orders of magnitude higher in indoor air than outdoor urban air. OPEs were the most abundant target FRs with median concentrations in indoor (Sigma 10OPE = 340 000 pg/m(3)) and outdoor urban (Sigma 10OPEs = 3100 pg/m(3)) air, being 3 orders of magnitude greater than for HFRs in indoor (Sigma(15)HFRs = 120 pg/m(3)) and outdoor urban (Sigma(15)HFRs = 1.6 pg/m(3)) air. In indoor air, PBDE concentrations (Sigma 17PBDEs =33 pg/m(3)) were lower than for the HFRs, but in outdoor urban air, concentrations (Sigma 17PBDEs = 1.1 pg/m(3)) were similar to HFRs. The most abundant OPEs in both the indoor and outdoor urban air were tris(2-butoxyethyl)phosphate (TBOEP), tris(chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP), tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP), tri-n-butyl-phosphate (TnBP), triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) and tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl)phosphate (TDCIPP). TCIPP in indoor air was found in the highest concentrations and showed the greatest temporal variability, which ranged from 85 000 to 1 900 000 pg/m(3) during the one-year sampling period. We speculate that activities in the building, e.g. floor cleaning, polishing, construction, introduction of new electronics and changes in ventilation rate could explain its variation. Some OPEs (TnBP, TCEP, TCIPP, TDCIPP and TPhP), HFRs/PBDEs (pentabromotoluene, 2, 3-dibromopropyl 2, 4, 6-tribromophenyl ether, hexabromobenzene, BDE-28, -47, and -99) in outdoor urban air showed seasonality, with increased concentrations during the warm period (p < 0.05, Pearson's r ranged from 0.45 to 0.91). The observed seasonality for OPEs was probably due to changes in primary emission, and those for the HFRs and PBDEs was likely due to re-volatilization from contaminated surfaces.

Bioaccumulation of Heavy Metals in Some Tissues of Fish in Lake Geriyo, Adamawa State, Nigeria	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Bioaccumulation of heavy metals (Zn, Pb, Cd, and Cu) was determined in the liver, gills, and flesh from benthic and pelagic fish species collected from Lake Geriyo covering two seasons. The levels of the heavy metals varied significantly among fish species and organs. Flesh possessed the lowest concentration of all the metals. Liver was the target organ for Zn, Cu, and Pb accumulations. Cd however exhibited higher concentration in the gills. Fish species showed interspecific variation of metals. These differences were discussed for the contribution of potential factors that affected metals uptake like age, geographical distribution, and species-specific factors. The concentration of metals in fish flesh was accepted by the international legislation limits for Cu, Zn, and Cd; however, Pb transcend in Clarias and Tilapia during wet season and Heterotis in both seasons, hence unsafe for human consumption and a threat to public health. These levels might be due to anthropogenic inputs as there is no industrial activity around the lake.																			1687-9805	1687-9813					2018	2018								1854892	10.1155/2018/1854892	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/1854892								29887895					WOS:000433369600001

Analytical approaches for the detection and quantification of TiO2 engineered nanoparticles in surface waters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-NANO												Detecting and quantifying engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) in complex environmental matrices requires the distinction between natural nanoparticles (NNPs) and ENPs. The distinction of NNPs and ENPs for regulatory purposes calls for cost-efficient methods, but is hampered by similarities in intrinsic properties, such as particle composition, size, density, surface chemistry, etc. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) ENPs, for instance, are produced in very large quantities but Ti also commonly occurs naturally in nano-scale minerals. In this work, we focus on utilizing particle size and composition to identify ENPs in a system with a significant background concentration of the target metal. We have followed independent approaches involving both conventional and state-of-the-art analytical techniques to detect and quantify TiO2 ENPs released into surface waters from sunscreen products and to distinguish them from Ti-bearing NNPs. To achieve this, we applied single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry with single-element (spICPMS) and multi-element detection (time-of-flight) spICP-TOFMS, together with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), automated scanning electron microscopy (autoSEM), and bulk elemental analyses. A background concentration of Ti-bearing NPs (approximately 5 x 10(3) particles per ml), possibly of natural origin, was consistently observed outside the bathing season. This concentration increased by up to 40% during the bathing season. Multi-element analysis of individual particles using spICP-TOFMS revealed that Al, Fe, Mn, and Pb are often present in natural Ti-bearing NPs, but no specific multi-element signatures were detected for ENPs. Our data suggests that TiO2 ENPs enter the lake water during bathing activities, eventually agglomerating and sedimenting. We found adhesion of the TiO2 ENPs to the air-water interface for short time periods, depending on wind conditions. This study demonstrates that the use of spICP-TOFMS and spICPMS in combination with other conventional analytical techniques offers significant advantages for discriminating between NNPs and ENPs. The quantitative data produced in this work can be used as input for modeling studies or as a benchmark for analysis protocols and model validations.

Here, the water, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and sediment samples were collected from 15 sites in wet and dry seasons in Zhenjiang, for the determination of six PAEs (DMP, DEP, DIBP, DBP, DEHP, and DOP) using the solid-phase extraction (SPE) or ultrasonic extraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The total concentrations of six PAEs (sigma(6)PAEs) spanned a range of 2.65-39.31 mu g L-1 in water, 1.97-34.10 mu g g(-1) in SPM, and 0.93-34.70 mu g g(-1) in sediment. The partition coefficients (K-d1) of PAEs in water and SPM phase ranged from 0.004 to 3.36 L g(-1) in the wet season and from 0.12 to 2.84 L g(-1) in the dry season. K-d2 of PAEs in water and sediment phase was 0.001-9.75 L g(-1) in the wet season and 0.006-8.05 L g(-1) in the dry season. The dominant PAEs were DIBP, DBP, and DEHP in water and SPM, DIBP, DEHP, and DOP in sediment. The concentration of DBP in water exceeded the China Surface Water Standard. The discharge of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater might be the main potential sources of PAEs. The risk quotient (RQ) method used for the risk assessment revealed that DBP (0.01 < RQ < 1) posed a medium risk, while DIBP and DEHP (RQ > 1) posed a high environmental risk in water, DIBP (RQ > 1) also showed a high risk in sediment.					wu, xiangyang/E-4437-2017; Chen, Hui/AAF-5341-2020														0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2019	26	24					24609	24619		10.1007/s11356-019-05259-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-05259-y								31236858					WOS:000480557400027

We investigated the fluorescent intensities (F-max) of DOM components and examined their correlation with the water quality parameters in peri-urban (Zhangxi River) and urban (Lu River) watersheds in Ningbo, East China. DOM quality was measured by fluorescent excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Terrestrial humic-like components (C1 and C2) and protein-like component (C3) were derived by the PARAFAC model. We found more serious water pollution (significantly higher values for most water quality parameters, i.e. chemical oxygen demand (COD), chlorophyll a (Chl-a), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ammonia and total suspended solids (TSS)) in urban than peri-urban watersheds. However, there were no significant differences in the levels of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) between the urban and peri-urban watersheds. The results showed that the urban watershed had higher terrestrial humic-like C1 (39%) and lower protein-like C3 (30%) than the peri-urban watershed, while the peri-urban watershed showed an inverse trend (33% and 37%, respectively). The results also revealed that the DOM fluorescent indices were significantly different between the peri-urban and the urban watersheds. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was applied to evaluate the correlation between DOM fluorescent indices and water quality parameters (i.e., COD, TN, TP, DOC). It revealed that the pollution sources and water quality correlated to the fluorescent indices and the C1-C3 DOM fluorescent components. A significant linear relationship between COD and C2 was found in both watersheds, suggesting that C2 might be a good COD indicator. Our results suggest that the distinctive DOM composition between the watersheds could be attributed to different human activities at both sites. The correlation between DOM fluorescent components and water quality can be assessed by the EEM-PARAFAC method, indicating considerable potential for the use of this technique to monitor surface water quality.

In this study, multivariate statistics coupled with probabilistic and deterministic risk estimation approaches were applied to 173 groundwater samples of Urmia aquifer (UA) to evaluate human health risks in relation to the consumption of groundwater contaminated with toxic elements. The concentrations of aluminum (Al), barium (Ba), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), and zinc (Zn) were below their corresponding maximum permissible levels as advised by the WHO, USEPA, and Iranian guidelines. However, arsenic (As), lead (Pb), iron (Fe), and selenium (Se) were elevated at some locations. Monte Carlo simulation-based probabilistic risk estimation suggested ingestion as the dominant pathway for water-hosted element exposure. Mean values of hazard index estimated for As exposure from combined ingestion and dermal contact pathways exceeded the safe level of 1.0 for both adults and children, indicated potential non-carcinogenic health risks. The total cancer risk induced by groundwater As exceeded the acceptable limit of 1 x 10(-4). Sensitivity analysis highlighted exposure duration, element concentration in water, and average time as the most significant variables causing the probable health risks. Speciation modeling using PHREEQC highlighted the occurrence of As(V) and As(III) in groundwater of the UA. Reductive dissolution of Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides and clay minerals was identified as the main controlling mechanism of As mobilization. This communication emphasizes the need for appropriate approaches in mitigating toxic element contamination of water resources in coastal parts of the UA to safeguard public health from carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks.					; Amiri, Vahab/AAW-1555-2021; Berndtsson, Ronny/C-7449-2015; Bhattacharya, Prosun/B-1564-2010; sohrabi, nassim/JJC-9398-2023; kalantari, nasrollah/AAI-8903-2021	Amiri, Vahab/0000-0001-9734-9812; Berndtsson, Ronny/0000-0003-1473-0138; 													1436-3240	1436-3259				JUL	2021	35	7					1509	1528		10.1007/s00477-020-01934-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-020-01934-6		NOV 2020											WOS:000590027800002

We used data from the Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellites to develop a threshold-based method for detection of lakes found on the Antarctic ice shelves, calculate their depths and thus their volumes. To achieve this, we focus on four key areas: the Amery, Roi Baudouin, Nivlisen, and Riiser-Larsen ice shelves, which are all characterized by extensive surface meltwater features. To validate our products, we compare our results against those obtained by an independent method based on a supervised classification scheme (e.g., Random Forest algorithm). Additional verification is provided by manual inspection of results for nearly 1000 Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images. Our dual-sensor approach will enable constructing high-resolution time series of lake volumes. Therefore, to ensure interoperability between the two datasets, we evaluate depths from contemporaneous Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 image pairs. Our assessments point to a high degree of correspondence, producing an average R-2 value of 0.85, no bias, and an average RMSE of 0.2 m. We demonstrate our method's ability to characterize lake evolution by presenting first evidence of drainage events outside of the Antarctic Peninsula on the Amery Ice shelf. The methods presented here pave the way to upscaling throughout the Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 observational record across Antarctica to produce a first-ever continental dataset of supraglacial lake volumes. Such a dataset will improve our understanding of the influence of surface hydrology on ice shelf stability, and thus, future projections of Antarctica's contribution to sea level rise.					; Trusel, Luke/E-2578-2013; Moussavi, Mahsa/B-4051-2016; Halberstadt, Anna Ruth/JPW-9990-2023	Trusel, Luke/0000-0002-7792-6173; Halberstadt, Anna Ruth/0000-0003-2582-7074; Pope, Allen/0000-0001-9699-7500														2072-4292				JAN	2020	12	1							134	10.3390/rs12010134	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12010134													WOS:000515391700134

They are a problem that occurs globally requiring an integrated and coordinated scientific understanding, leading to regional responses and solutions. Given that these natural phenomena will never be completely eliminated, an improved scientific understanding of HAB dynamics coupled with monitoring and ocean observations, facilitates new prediction and prevention strategies. Regional efforts are underway worldwide to create state-of-the-art HAB monitoring and forecasting tools, vulnerability assessments, and observing networks. In the United States, these include Alaska, Pacific Northwest, California, Gulf of Mexico, Gulf of Maine, Great Lakes, and the United States Caribbean islands. This paper examines several regional programs in the United States, European Union, and Asia and concludes that there is no one-size-fits-all approach. At the same time, successful programs require strong coordination with stakeholders and institutional sustainability to maintain and reinforce them with new automating technologies, wherever possible, ensuring integration of modeling efforts with multiple regional to national programs. Recommendations for scaling up to a global observing system for HABs can be summarized as follows: (1) advance and improve cost-effective and sustainable HAB forecast systems that address the HAB-risk warning requirements of key end-users at global and regional levels; (2) design programs that leverage and expand regional HAB observing systems to evaluate emerging technologies for Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) and Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) in order to support interregional technology comparisons and regional networks of observing capabilities; (3) fill the essential need for sustained, preferably automated, near real-time information from nearshore and offshore sites situated in HAB transport pathways to provide improved, advanced HAB warnings; (4) merge ecological knowledge and models with existing Earth System Modeling Frameworks to enhance end-to-end capabilities in forecasting and scenario-building; (5) provide seasonal to decadal forecasts to allow governments to plan, adapt to a changing marine environment, and ensure coastal industries are supported and sustained in the years ahead; and (6) support implementation of the recent calls for action by the United Nations Decade 2010 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to develop indicators that are relevant to an effective and global HAB early warning system.

To study water quality in appropriate temporal and spatial scales, it is necessary to develop methods to obtain IOPs form space-based observation with quantified uncertainties. Field-measured IOP data (N = 405) were collected from 17 surveys between 2011 and 2017 in the three major largest freshwater lakes of China (Lake Chaohu, Lake Taihu, and Lake Hongze) in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and Huai River (LYHR). Here we provide a case-study on how to use in-situ observation of IOPs to devise an improved algorithm for retrieval of IOPs. We then apply this algorithm to observation with Sentinel-3A OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument, corrected with our improved AC scheme), and use in-situ data to show that the algorithm performs better than the standard OLCI IOP product. We use the satellite derived products to study the spatial and seasonal distributions of IOPs and concentrations of optically active constituents in these three lakes, including chlorophyll-a (Chla) and suspended particulate matter (SPM), using all cloud-free OLCI images (115 scenes) over the lakes in the LYHR basin in 2017.

It provides a variety of ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration, water purification, soil fertility, and habitat for diverse flora and fauna. These services are crucial for sustaining the livelihoods of local communities and maintaining the health of the environment. In megacities like Kolkata, India, the BL is often subjected to fragmentation and degradation due to rapid urbanisation, industrialization, and other human activities. This has serious implications for ecosystem services and the overall health of the environment. This study is intended to value ecosystem service losses over the last 25 years and assess the influence of blue landscape fragmentation on ecosystem services in Kolkata, India. To accomplish this goal, satellite data was collected from 1994 to 2019 for both pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. The results of the study showed that significant losses in ecosystem services were observed over this time period, primarily due to the decline of the East Kolkata Wetland and its conversion for settlement and agricultural purposes. Despite the existence of some policies aimed at protecting the wetland, more robust restrictions and remedial strategies are required to conserve and restore the blue landscape in Kolkata. This work adds to the corpus of research on the value of blue landscapes (BLs) and the environmental services they provide. The findings of this study highlight the need for increased attention to the conservation and management of BLs in India and provide a valuable foundation for future research and policy development. Furthermore, this research introduces the innovative concept of urban BLs as a nature-based framework for understanding urban landscape fragmentation, a novel contribution that fills a gap in the existing literature on this topic.

To elucidate the mechanisms underlying such "counter-intuitive" CyanoHAB species succession, metatranscriptomes (biotic data) and water quality-related variables (abiotic data) were analyzed weekly during a bloom season in Harsha Lake, a multipurpose lake that serves as a drinking water source and recreational ground. Our results showed that CyanoHABs in Harsha Lake started with N2-fixing Anabaena in June (ANA stage) when N was high, and transitioned to non-N2-fixing Microcystis- and Planktothrix-dominated in July (MIC-PLA stage) when N became limited (low TN/TP). Meanwhile, the concentrations of cyanotoxins, i.e., microcystins were significantly higher in the MIC-PLA stage. Water quality results revealed that N species (i.e., TN, TN/TP) and water temperature were significantly correlated with cyanobacterial biomass. Expression levels of several C- and N-processing-related cyanobacterial genes were highly predictive of the biomass of their species. More importantly, the biomasses of Microcystis and Planktothrix were also significantly associated with expressions of microbial genes (mostly from heterotrophic bacteria) related to processing organic substrates (alkaline phosphatase, peptidase, carbohydrateactive enzymes) and cyanophage genes. Collectively, our results suggest that besides environmental conditions and inherent traits of specific cyanobacterial species, the development and succession of CyanoHABs are regulated by co-occurring microorganisms. Specifically, the co-occurring microorganisms can alleviate the nutrient limitation of cyanobacteria by remineralizing organic compounds.

Complex and diverse data sources are available to investigate the cyanobacteria phenomena, including in situ data, synthetic measurements, and remote sensing images. Deep learning attention models can process these intricate sources to forecast cyanobacteria by identifying important variables in the data sources. However, deep learning attention models for predicting cyanobacteria have rarely been studied using an assemblage of various datasets. Thus, in this study, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with a convolutional block attention module (CNNan) was developed to predict cyanobacterial cell concentrations by using the observed cell data from field monitoring, chlorophyll-a distribution map from hyperspectral image sensing, and simulated water quality outputs from a hydrodynamic model. Then, the prediction performance of the CNNan model was compared to an environmental fluid dynamics code (EFDC) simulation and a CNN model without an attention network. The seasonal variations of the predicted cyanobacteria that was obtained from CNNan showed the best agreement with the observed variations with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values higher than 0.76 when compared to the EFDC and CNN predictions. The daily hydrodynamic outputs allowed the prediction of cyanobacteria cells, while the rich information of the chlorophyll-a map contributed to the improvement of the prediction performance at certain periods. Moreover, the attention network visualized the importance of the additional chlorophyll-a map and improved the CNNan model prediction performance by refining the input features. Therefore, this study demonstrated that a deep learning model with data assemblage is practically feasible for predicting the presence of harmful algae in inland water.					; Cho, Kyunghwa/AAO-7769-2021; Baek, SangSoo/LFT-3581-2024	Pyo, JongCheol/0000-0001-9204-5879; 													0043-1354	1879-2448				SEP 15	2021	203								117483	10.1016/j.watres.2021.117483	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.117483		AUG 2021						34384949					WOS:000697760700001

Eleven pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) (sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, ethyl paraben, diclofenac, propylparaben, ibuprofen, BP-1, oxybenzone, bisphenol A, triclosan, triclocarban) were investigated for their occurrence, seasonal variation, and toxicological effects on the biota. The PPCPs belong to different classes like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, antibacterials, UV-filters, plasticizer, and preservatives. Ibuprofen was present in high concentrations (1834 ng/L) followed by triclosan (1761 ng/L) and diclofenac (1130 ng/L) in the river. Samples collected during monsoon season had lower concentrations of sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol and diclofenac whereas rest of the target analytes had lower concentrations during post-monsoon season. Dilution in monsoon season and adsorption to the sediments in the post-monsoon season can be the possible reasons for the seasonal variability. The highest detection frequencies of PPCPs at the Arkavathi river indicates the continuous discharge of wastewater from highly populated metropolitan and industrial areas. The ecotoxicity data for diclofenac and triclosan suggest high risk (Hazard Quotient >1) for various species of fish and algae observed from the Kumbalagodu (S20) and Shanumangala (S19) stations respectively from the mid-stream of Arkavathi river. It was followed by bisphenol A with a hazard quotient of 0.88 in Banashankari (S25) that can affect specific species of fish. No human health risk assessment was estimated from the identified sampling stations. This is the first report on seasonal occurrence of PPCPs with their associated toxicological studies from the Arkavathi river, its tributaries, and lakes across the Bengaluru metropolis.					; Singhal, Rakesh Kumar/ITT-5521-2023; Balakrishna, K/H-4796-2019; Ramaswamy, Babu/AAP-3875-2020; Bhat, Krishnamurthy/H-5143-2019; Kumar, Virendra/AGZ-5425-2022; Basu, Hirakendu/GXN-4306-2022	Bhat, Krishnamurthy/0000-0002-8604-472X; , Shailesh Perdalkar/0000-0002-6817-9698; Basu, Hirakendu/0000-0001-5659-6585; Balakrishna, Keshava/0000-0002-5399-0808; Praveen Kumar Reddy, Dr. Yerabham/0000-0002-0033-3003; Yovan, Lino/0000-0001-6836-073X; 													2213-2929	2213-3437				AUG	2021	9	4							105610	10.1016/j.jece.2021.105610	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2021.105610		MAY 2021											WOS:000670397400001

This study presents unique data on concentrations and loads of 31 PPCPs and 10 pesticides in four wastewater stabilization ponds (WSPs) and receiving rivers (flowing through urban centres) in Kenya. The WSPs indicate a high potential to remove pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) with removals by up to >4 orders of magnitude (>99.99% removal), mainly occurring at the facultative stage. However, there are large differences in removal among the different classes, and a shift in the relative PhACs occurrence is observed during wastewater treatment. Whereas the influent is dominated by high-consumption PhACs like anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. paracetamol and ibuprofen, up to 1000 mu g L-1), the most recalcitrant PhACs including mainly antibiotics (e.g. sulfadoxin and sulfamethoxazole) and antiretrovirals (e.g. lamivudine and nevirapine) are largely abundant (up to 100 mu g L-1) in treated effluent. Overall, concentrations of EOMPs in the Nzoia Basin rivers are the highest in dry season (except pesticides) and in small tributaries. They are of the same order of magnitude as those measured in the western world, but clearly lower than what we recently measured in the Ngong River, Nairobi region. Based on the specific consumption patterns and recalcitrant behavior, high concentrations (>1000 ng L-1) are observed in the rivers for PPCPs like lamivudine, zidovudine, sulfamethoxazole and methylparaben. Concentration levels of pesticides are in general one order of magnitude lower (<250 ng L-1). Our data suggest a continuous input of EOMPs to the rivers from both point (WSPs) and diffuse (urban centres) sources. To better understand and manage the impact of both sources, EOMP removal mechanisms in WSPs and their attenuation in rivers merit further research. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The processes that contribute to these fluxes, their environmental controls, and anthropogenic influences, however, are poorly constrained. Here, we studied the spatial variability and seasonal dynamics of CO2 and CH4 fluxes across the sediment-water interface, and their relationships to porewater nutrient concentrations in Lake Ulansuhai, a shallow eutrophic lake located in a semi-arid region in Northern China. The mean concentrations of CO2 and CH4 in porewater were 877.8 +/- 31.0 mu mol L-1 and 689.2 +/- 45.0 mu mol L-1, which were more than 50 and 20 times higher than those in the water column, respectively. The sediment was always a source of both gases for the water column. Porewater CO2 and CH4 concentrations and diffusive fluxes across the sediment -water interface showed significant temporal and spatial variations with mean diffusive fluxes of 887.3 +/- 124.7 mu mol m- 2 d-1 and 607.1 +/- 68.0 mu mol m- 2 d-1 for CO2 and CH4, respectively. The temporal and spatial variations of CO2 and CH4 concentrations in porewater were associated with corresponding variations in dissolved organic carbon and dissolved nitrogen species. Temperature and dissolved organic carbon in surface porewater were the most important drivers of temporal variations in diffusive fluxes, whereas dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen were the main drivers of their spatial variations. Diffusive fluxes generally increased with increasing dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen in the porewater from the inflow to the outflow region of the lake. The estimated fluxes of both gases at the sediment-water interface were one order of magnitude lower than the emissions at the water surface, which were measured in a companion study. This indicates that diffusive fluxes across the sediment-water interface were not the main pathway for CO2 and CH4 emissions to the atmosphere. To improve the mechanistic understanding and predictability of greenhouse gas emissions from shallow lakes, future studies should aim to close the apparent gap in the CO2 and CH4 budget by combining improved flux measurement techniques with process-based modeling.

In the present study, pollution characteristics, source and health risk of dissolved heavy metals in 19 representative reservoirs in the hilly area of southern China were investigated. The results presented great spatial heterogeneity in heavy metal concentrations among the studied reservoirs due to the disturbances by different anthropogenic activities. Several reservoirs had significantly higher concentrations of heavy metals compared with others, FengTan (FT) reservoir (0.34 mu g/L in dry season), Cr in reservoirs of HuangShi (HS) and ZheLin (ZL) with values of 4.16 mu g/L and 3.45 mu g/L in dry season respectively, and Al in reservoirs of JiaoKou (JK), GuTian (GT) and DouShui (DS) with values of 1011 mu g/L, 1036 mu g/L and 1001 mu g/L in wet season, respectively. Furthermore, there was a great difference in the seasonal variation of heavy metals, especially for Al and Pb in wet season characterized with relatively high values of 643 mu g/L and 0.67 mu g/L, respectively. Accordingly, Al was identified with a great health risk to living beings in view of its mean value in wet season, which greatly exceeded the criteria for drinking water of China, WHO and US EPA. Furthermore, As might be the greatest concern of health risk in this region considering its high carcinogenic risk to the local residents around the reservoirs of OuYangHai (OYH), DS, ZhiXi (ZX) and HS. Multivariate statistical analysis suggested that there was great heterogeneity in the sources of these heavy metals in the hilly area of southern China. Therefore, specific measures, such as controls on point source pollution control and tailings, should be taken for maintaining drinking water safety and aquatic ecosystem health.

Archaeological, geochronological, geomorphological, and paleoenvironmental data from northern Malawi document a changing relationship between forager presence, ecosystem organization, and alluvial fan formation in the Late Pleistocene. Dense concentrations of Middle Stone Age artifacts and alluvial fan systems formed after ca. 92 thousand years ago, within a paleoecological context with no analog in the preceding half-million-year record.

To deal with this challenge, we proposed a spatiotemporal adaptive fusion model for NDVI products (STAFFN), to better blend highly resolved spatial and temporal information from multiple sensors. Compared with existing spatiotemporal fusion models, the proposed model integrates an initial prediction into a hierarchical selection strategy of similar pixels, and can capture landscape changes very well. Experiments using spatial details and temporal abundance comparison among MODIS, Landsat, and fusion results show that the predicted data can accurately capture temporal changes while preserving fine-spatial-resolution details. Model comparison also shows that STAFFNs produce consistently lower biases than STARFMs and the flexible spatiotemporal data fusion models (FSDAFs). A synthetic NDVI product (342 scenes in total) was produced with STAFFNs having a 16-day revisit frequency at 30-m spatial resolution from 2000 to 2014. With this product, we further provided a 15-year spatiotemporal change monitoring map of the Poyang Lake wetland. Results show that the water area in the dry season tended to lose 38.3 km(2) yr(-1) in coverage over the past 15 years, decreasing by 18.24% of the lake area between 2001 and 2014. The wetland vegetation group tended to increase in coverage, increasing by 10.08% of the lake area in the past 15 years. Our study indicates the STAFFN model can be reasonably applied in monitoring wetland dynamics, and can be easily adapted for the use with other ecosystems.

Tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris(2-chloroisopropyl)phosphate (TCIPP), and triethyl phosphate (TEP) were the most abundant OPEs in the surface water and sediment. The OPEs levels in river water were ranked as the order of dry > normal > wet season. The SOPE concentrations in water and sediment were relatively high in the central and lower sections of the YR.

J	Michel, A; Brauchli, T; Lehning, M; Schaefli, B; Huwald, H				Michel, Adrien; Brauchli, Tristan; Lehning, Michael; Schaefli, Bettina; Huwald, Hendrik			Stream temperature and discharge evolution in Switzerland over the last 50 years: annual and seasonal behaviour	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Stream temperature and discharge are key hydrological variables for ecosystem and water resource management and are particularly sensitive to climate warming. Despite the wealth of meteorological and hydrological data, few studies have quantified observed stream temperature trends in the Alps. This study presents a detailed analysis of stream temperature and discharge in 52 catchments in Switzerland, a country covering a wide range of alpine and lowland hydrological regimes. The influence of discharge, precipitation, air temperature, and upstream lakes on stream temperatures and their temporal trends is analysed from multi-decadal to seasonal timescales. Stream temperature has significantly increased over the past 5 decades, with positive trends for all four seasons. The mean trends for the last 20 years are + 0.37 +/- 0.11 degrees C per decade for water temperature, resulting from the joint effects of trends in air temperature (+0.39 +/- 0.14 degrees C per decade), discharge (-10.1 +/- 4.6 % per decade), and precipitation (-9.3 +/- 3.4 % per decade). For a longer time period (1979-2018), the trends are +0.33 +/- 0.03 degrees C per decade for water temperature, +0.46 +/- 0.03 degrees C per decade for air temperature, -3.0 +/- 0.5 % per decade for discharge, and -1.3 +/- 0.5 % per decade for precipitation. Furthermore, we show that snow and glacier melt compensates for air temperature warming trends in a transient way in alpine streams. Lakes, on the contrary, have a strengthening effect on downstream water temperature trends at all elevations. Moreover, the identified stream temperature trends are shown to have critical impacts on ecological and economical temperature thresholds (the spread of fish diseases and the usage of water for industrial cooling), especially in lowland rivers, suggesting that these waterways are becoming more vulnerable to the increasing air temperature forcing. Resilient alpine rivers are expected to become more vulnerable to warming in the near future due to the expected reductions in snow-and glacier-melt inputs. A detailed mathematical framework along with the necessary source code are provided with this paper.					; Lehning, Michael/AFS-9462-2022; Schaefli, Bettina/B-2069-2010; Huwald, Hendrik/C-1746-2012	Huwald, Hendrik/0000-0003-3769-7342; Lehning, Michael/0000-0002-8442-0875; Brauchli, Tristan/0000-0003-3332-4995; Schaefli, Bettina/0000-0003-1140-6244; 													1027-5606	1607-7938				JAN 10	2020	24	1					115	142		10.5194/hess-24-115-2020	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-115-2020													WOS:000506844700001

The southern African climate under 1.5 °C and 2 °C of global warming as simulated by CORDEX regional climate models	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Results from an 25 regional climate model simulations from the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment Africa initiative are used to assess the projected changes in temperature and precipitation over southern Africa at two global warming levels (GWLs), namely 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C, relative to pre-industrial values, under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. The results show a robust increase in temperature compared to the control period (1971-2000) ranging from 0.5 degrees C-1.5 degrees C for the 1.5 degrees C GWL and from 1.5 degrees C-2.5 degrees C, for the 2.0 degrees C GWL. Areas in the south-western region of the subcontinent, covering South Africa and parts of Namibia and Botswana are projected to experience the largest increase in temperature, which are greater than the global mean warming, particularly during the September-October-November season. On the other hand, under 1.5 degrees C GWL, models exhibit a robust reduction in precipitation of up to 0.4 mmday(-1) (roughly 20% of the climatological values) over the Limpopo Basin and smaller areas of the Zambezi Basin in Zambia, and also parts of Western Cape, South Africa. Models project precipitation increase of up to 0.1 mmday(-1) over central and western South Africa and in southern Namibia. Under 2.0 degrees C GWL, a larger fraction of land is projected to face robust decreases between 0.2 and 0.4 mmday(-1) (around 10%-20% of the climatological values) over most of the central subcontinent and parts of western South Africa and northern Mozambique. Decreases in precipitation are accompanied by increases in the number of consecutive dry days and decreases in consecutive wet days over the region. The importance of achieving the Paris Agreement is imperative for southern Africa as the projected changes under both the 1.5 degrees C, and more so, 2.0 degrees C GWL imply significant potential risks to agricultural and economic productivity, human and ecological systems health and water resources with implied increase in regional water stresses.					; Pinto, Izidine/AAF-5999-2020; Dosio, Alessandro/U-9093-2017; Lennard, Chris/C-2120-2014; Murisa, Mzime/AFS-0432-2022	Murisa, Mzime/0000-0001-8096-2979; Dosio, Alessandro/0000-0002-6365-9473; Pinto, Izidine/0000-0002-9919-4559; Muthige, mavhungu/0000-0003-0031-4192; Lennard, Chris/0000-0001-6085-0320; Maure, Genito/0000-0002-9089-1905; 													1748-9326					JUN	2018	13	6							065002	10.1088/1748-9326/aab190	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aab190													WOS:000433551600001

We systematically assessed the Noah land surface model (LSM) with mutiparameterization options (Noah-MP) in simulating these fluxes and associated variations in terrestrial water storage (TWS) and snow cover fraction (SCF) against various reference products over 18 United States Geological Survey two-digital hydrological unit code regions of the continental United States (CONUS). In general, Noah-MP captures better the observed seasonal and interregional variability of net radiation, SCF, and runoff than other variables. With a dynamic vegetation model, it overestimates gross primary productivity by 40% and evapotranspiration (ET) by 22% over the whole CONUS domain; however, with a prescribed climatology of leaf area index, it greatly improves ET simulation with relative bias dropping to 4%. It accurately simulates regional TWS dynamics in most regions except those with large lakes or severely affected by irrigation and/or impoundments. Incorporating the lake water storage variations into the modeled TWS variations largely reduces the TWS simulation bias more obviously over the Great Lakes with model efficiency increasing from 0.18 to 0.76. Noah-MP simulates runoff well in most regions except an obvious overestimation (underestimation) in the Rio Grande and Lower Colorado (New England). Compared with North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 (NLDAS-2) LSMs, Noah-MP shows a better ability to simulate runoff and a comparable skill in simulating R-n but a worse skill in simulating ET over most regions. This study suggests that future model developments should focus on improving the representations of vegetation dynamics, lake water storage dynamics, and human activities including irrigation and impoundments.

J	Eagar, RMC; van Amerom, HWJ				Eagar, RMC; van Amerom, HWJ			A new highly variable non-marine bivalve fauna and a new species from basal Westphalian D near Osnabruck, Germany	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH-EARTH SCIENCES												The study is based on over 170 bivalve specimens collected in the last seven years by three independent collectors in basal Westphalian D strata at Piesberg Quarry, near Osnabruck, northern Germany. All the material has come from the roof shales of either the Bankchen or the Dreibanke coal, 25 m above it, most of it from above the Dreibanke coal. Both faunal bands have closely similar sediments, shells and floral associations, mainly of hydrophyllic plants, including those that characterise waterlogged swamps. The palaeoenvironments were, on average, of low energy deltaic lakes. Both faunal bands constitute life assemblages of small, sparse Anthraconaia mingled with abundant plants and plant debris in richly carbonaceous shale with a variable carbonate content. Siphonal and pedal gapes of the valves indicate that the bivalves lived in a steeply burrowing position probably below the surface of the sediments. After death most valve pairs lay with their median planes parallel to the bedding planes of the sediment. Later overlying pressure, normal to bedding planes and varying according to the time of carbonate formation, led to a pattern of breakdown of the convexity of the shells essentially the same as that found in larger Anthraconaia in Westphalian B. In both cases it appears that lateral profiles of shells have been unaffected by vertical crushing. It is therefore reasonable to treat the profiles of uncrushed and vertically crushed shells together. On the basis of measurements and morphology two groups of shells have been distinguished at Piesberg, that of Anthraconaia pruvosti (Tchernychev) Weir, comprising about 96 per cent of the fauna, and the remainder Anthraconaia piesbergensis sp. nov. Each is illustrated by a variation diagram or pictograph and is in part defined by growth equations in terms of shell length, height and anterior end. The small A. piesbergensis, which also yields evidence of posterior gape, is formally described. Anthraconaia pruvosti, which has not been previously recorded in Germany, shows extremely wide variation with a number of new varieties, but all intergrade with previously known varieties of this species and include Anthraconaia weissiana (Geinitz). The mean size of the shells is half that of the holotype, from northern France, but size ranges are comparable with those from the U.K. The mode of the fauna lies around small, elongate, subtriangular shells with nearly straight to slightly reflected ventral margins. The elements of the Piesberg fauna fall into place stratigraphically in the sequence of Anthraconaia faunas in Westphalian C to late Westphalian D, mainly in the southern part of the U.K. Moreover, very small, scarce shells recently described above No. 10 coal, late Westphalian D at Writhlington, Somerset, U.K., appear related to A. piesbergensis. At this horizon they had different associates and a different palaeohabitat from those of the larger Anthraconaia pringlei (Dix & Trueman) which succeeded A. pruvosti. It is therefore likely that A. piesbergensis may have occupied a different palaeoecological niche from that of A. pruvosti and that A. piesbergensis was collected from a horizon slightly different from those yielding A. pruvosti at Piesberg Quarry, possibly from a fauna which lived in shallower water. Re-figuring of uncrushed, excellently preserved material of Anthraconaia aff. pruvosti from late Westphalian C of Pembrokeshire, SW Wales, reveals new evidence of the musculature of the genus Anthraconaia. There is also clear evidence of siphonal and pedal gapes in closed valves, both being features previously unrecognised in Anthraconaia, and characteristic, to date, only of Westphalian late C and D Stages in Germany and the U.K.																			0263-5933						1999	90		1				67	86		10.1017/S0263593300002510	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0263593300002510													WOS:000084049900004

Urea Is Both a Carbon and Nitrogen Source for Microcystis aeruginosa: Tracking 13C Incorporation at Bloom pH Conditions	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												The use of urea as a nitrogenous fertilizer has increased over the past two decades, with urea itself being readily detected at high concentrations in many lakes. Urea has been linked to cyanobacterial blooms as it is a readily assimilated nitrogen (N) - source for cyanobacteria that possess the enzyme urease. We tested the hypothesis that urea may also act as a carbon (C) source to supplemental growth requirements during the alkaline conditions created by dense cyanobacterial blooms, when concentrations of dissolved CO2 are vanishingly low. High rates of photosynthesis markedly reduce dissolved CO2 concentrations and drive up pH. This was observed in Lake Erie during the largest bloom on record (2015) over long periods (months) and short periods (days) of time, suggesting blooms experience periods of CO2-limitation on a seasonal and daily basis. We used C-13-urea to demonstrate that axenic cultures of the model toxic cyanobacterium, Microcystis aeruginosa NIES843, assimilated C at varying environmentally relevant pH conditions directly into a spectrum of metabolic pools during urea hydrolysis. Primarily, C-13 from urea was assimilated into central C metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis pathways, including those important for the production of the hepatotoxin, microcystin, and incorporation into these pathways was at a higher percentage during growth at higher pH. This corresponded to increased growth rates on urea as the sole N source with increasing pH. We propose this ability to incorporate C from urea represents yet another competitive advantage for this cyanobacterium during dense algal blooms.					; Zepernick, Brittany/IQW-1484-2023; Wilhelm, Steven/B-8963-2008	Krausfeldt, Lauren/0000-0001-7405-427X; Wilhelm, Steven/0000-0001-6283-8077; Castro, Hector/0000-0001-7323-1123; Zepernick, Brittany N/0000-0003-3121-1225													1664-302X					MAY 17	2019	10								1064	10.3389/fmicb.2019.01064	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01064								31164875					WOS:000468141200001
J	Zhao, G; Gao, HL; Cai, XM				Zhao, Gang; Gao, Huilin; Cai, Ximing			Estimating lake temperature profile and evaporation losses by leveraging MODIS LST data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Global lake evaporation is a critical component of the terrestrial water cycle. Accurate quantification of lake evaporation dynamics is of high importance for understanding lake energy budgets, land-atmosphere interactions, as well as regional water availability. However, the accurate quantification of lake evaporation has been hindered by the complexity involved with addressing the heat storage of water bodies. In this study, a new model-the Lake Temperature and Evaporation Model (LTEM)-was developed to simulate lake water temperature profiles, which were then used to calculate heat storage changes and evaporation rates. Inputs for the LTEM include the meteorological and bathymetric data, as well as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) water surface temperature (WST)-which is the land surface te`mperature (LST) over water. The MODIS WST was leveraged to constrain the hydrodynamic simulations. Model results over 11 lakes around the world show robust performance of LTEM. The long term average temperature biases range from-0.5 degrees C to 0.5 degrees C, and the evaporation rate biases range from-0.19 mm/day to 0.28 mm/day. In particular, it is found that LTEM significantly improves the simulation of the seasonality of lake evaporation rates. The validation results suggest that the averaged coefficient of determination (R2) for the evaporation rate is 0.84, which is 0.28 higher than that obtained when the conventional Penman equation (without heat storage) is used. The volumetric evaporation time series was then calculated as a product of the monthly evaporation rate and lake surface area (derived from MODIS near-infrared image classifications). This study provides an end-to-end framework for quantifying volumetric evaporation for the world's lakes and reservoirs. It also provides the capability to investigate the thermal dynamics of lake systems, and thus can benefit the various water resources applications across scales.

J	Deng, XJ				Deng, Xiaojun			Correlations between water quality and the structure and connectivity of the river network in the Southern Jiangsu Plain, Eastern China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Incorporating the structure and connectivity of the river network to seasonal variations and different land use patterns can help improve the understanding the complex relationship between water quality and environmental factors. The present study first employed the grey relational analysis (GRA) to examine any existing correlations between the water quality and the structure and connectivity of river networks in the Southern Jiangsu Plain in Eastern China. All grey relational degree results were greater than the distinguishing coefficient (rho - 05), and their average value was 07551. The average grey relational degrees of the water quality parameters varied between 0.7389 and 0.7744, and those of the characteristic indicators of the river network ranged from 0.6874 to 0.8850. Seasonal variations and different land use patterns were then employed to further analyze these relationships. The average grey relational degrees in the urban, rural, and fringe regions were calculated to be 0.7231, 0.7530, and 0.7124 during the flood season, respectively, and 0.7331, 0.7432, and 0.7052 during the non-flood season. The results suggest strong correlations between the water quality and the structure and connectivity of the river network. The preponderance of the urban land weakened the original correlations more than that of the cultivated land, while the seasonal interactions of the cultivated and urban lands presented opposite. The GRA can be employed as an effective supplement for numerical modeling and statistical analysis of the incomplete data. In addition, the structure and connectivity of the river network should be taken in account to improve water quality. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The North American tree-ring fire-scar network	ECOSPHERE												Fire regimes in North American forests are diverse and modern fire records are often too short to capture important patterns, trends, feedbacks, and drivers of variability. Tree-ring fire scars provide valuable perspectives on fire regimes, including centuries-long records of fire year, season, frequency, severity, and size. Here, we introduce the newly compiled North American tree-ring fire-scar network (NAFSN), which contains 2562 sites, >37,000 fire-scarred trees, and covers large parts of North America. We investigate the NAFSN in terms of geography, sample depth, vegetation, topography, climate, and human land use. Fire scars are found in most ecoregions, from boreal forests in northern Alaska and Canada to subtropical forests in southern Florida and Mexico. The network includes 91 tree species, but is dominated by gymnosperms in the genus Pinus. Fire scars are found from sea level to >4000-m elevation and across a range of topographic settings that vary by ecoregion. Multiple regions are densely sampled (e.g., >1000 fire-scarred trees), enabling new spatial analyses such as reconstructions of area burned. To demonstrate the potential of the network, we compared the climate space of the NAFSN to those of modern fires and forests; the NAFSN spans a climate space largely representative of the forested areas in North America, with notable gaps in warmer tropical climates. Modern fires are burning in similar climate spaces as historical fires, but disproportionately in warmer regions compared to the historical record, possibly related to under-sampling of warm subtropical forests or supporting observations of changing fire regimes. The historical influence of Indigenous and non-Indigenous human land use on fire regimes varies in space and time. A 20th century fire deficit associated with human activities is evident in many regions, yet fire regimes characterized by frequent surface fires are still active in some areas (e.g., Mexico and the southeastern United States). These analyses provide a foundation and framework for future studies using the hundreds of thousands of annually- to sub-annually-resolved tree-ring records of fire spanning centuries, which will further advance our understanding of the interactions among fire, climate, topography, vegetation, and humans across North America.

Seven polymers in sediments and four polymers in water were characterized from the study area, among which LDPE was the most dominant. Sediment texture results showed that clay particles were able to retain a greater number of MPs. This study shows that the Vellar estuary is contaminated with MPs; however, further investigation is required to classify the es-tuary as polluted.

Wildfire impacts on hydrologic ecosystem services in North American high-latitude forests: A scoping review	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												High-latitude forests of North America are characterized by their natural dependence on large and severe wildfires. However, these wildfires also pose a range of social, economic, and environmental risks, with growing concern regarding persistent effects on stream flow volume, seasonal timing of flow, water quality, aquatic ecosystem health, and downstream community drinking water treatment. Here, we present the outcomes of a comprehensive scoping review of post-fire hydrologic studies in high-latitude forests of North America (Canada and Alaska). Our objectives were to (1) create an inventory of studies on post-fire hydrologic effects on surface water; (2) analyze those studies in terms of watershed characteristics and the type and duration of hydrologic effects; (3) identify and evaluate the link between upstream hydrologic effects with hydrologic ecosystem services; and (4) propose a research agenda addressing the link between wildfire science and hydrologic ecosystem services. We screened 2935 peer-reviewed articles and selected 82 studies to include based on their relevance according to a systematic, multi-step selection process. Next, we classified the papers into five themes: (a) runoff volume and flow regimes, (b) erosion and sediment transport, (c) water chemistry, (d) hydromorphology, and (e) aquatic food webs. For each study, we documented location, fire regime, watershed characteristics, and ecosystem services. The annual number of published studies on post-fire hydrology in high-latitude forests and, in particular, those addressing hydrologic ecosystem services, has increased steadily in recent years. Descriptions of wildfire characteristics, watershed characteristics, and effects on hydrologic ecosystem services were highly variable across studies, hindering cross-study comparisons. Moreover, there were limited efforts to extend study results to implications for forest or water management decisions regarding ecosystem services from source watersheds. Most studies focused on fire impacts on aquatic habitats and water chemistry while services of direct concern to communities, such as drinking water, were rarely addressed. We contend that study standardization, further use of geospatial technologies, and more studies directly addressing ecosystem services will help mitigate the increasing risks to water resources in northern forests.					; Bladon, Kevin/AAC-9199-2020; Robinne, François-Nicolas/I-7324-2019; Bladon, Kevin/O-2500-2014	Hallema, Dennis/0000-0003-1384-5435; Robinne, Francois-Nicolas/0000-0002-0554-7668; Bladon, Kevin/0000-0002-4182-6883													0022-1694	1879-2707				FEB	2020	581								124360	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124360	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124360													WOS:000514758300004

In this study, we used SWAT to evaluate the impacts on four HES, natural hazard protection, erosion control regulation and water supply and flow regulation for the Laguna del Sauce catchment in Uruguay. We used downscaled CMIP-5 global climate models for Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 projections. We calibrated and validated our SWAT model for the periods 2005-2009 and 2010-2013 based on remote sensed ET data. Monthly NSE and R2 values for calibration and validation were 0.74, 0.64 and 0.79, 0.84, respectively. Our results suggest that climate change will likely negatively affect the water resources of the Laguna del Sauce catchment, especially in the RCP 8.5 scenario. In all RCP scenarios, the catchment is likely to experience a wetting trend, higher temperatures, seasonality shifts and an increase in extreme precipitation events, particularly in frequency and magnitude. This will likely affect water quality provision through runoff and sediment yield inputs, reducing the erosion control HES and likely aggravating eutrophication. Although the amount of water will increase, changes to the hydrological cycle might jeopardize the stability of freshwater supplies and HES on which many people in the south-eastern region of Uruguay depend. Despite streamflow monitoring capacities need to be enhanced to reduce the uncertainty of model results, our findings provide valuable insights for water resources planning in the study area. Hence, water management and monitoring capacities need to be enhanced to reduce the potential negative climate change impacts on HES. The methodological approach presented here, based on satellite ET data can be replicated and adapted to any other place in the world since we employed open-access software and remote sensing data for all the phases of hydrological modelling and HES provision assessment.					; López-Ballesteros, Adrián/R-9003-2018; Lopez-Ballesteros, Adrian/R-9003-2018; Jimeno-Saez, Patricia/ABG-1980-2020; Senent Aparicio, Javier/L-2481-2017; Aznarez, Celina/KSL-9758-2024	Aznarez, Celina/0000-0001-7807-1413; Pacheco Esnal, Juan Pablo/0000-0002-8100-2635; Lopez-Ballesteros, Adrian/0000-0001-6350-5653; Jimeno Saez, Patricia/0000-0003-4733-7236; Senent Aparicio, Javier/0000-0002-1818-5811														2072-4292				MAY	2021	13	10							2014	10.3390/rs13102014	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13102014													WOS:000662529900001

Here we simulate the ALT and permafrost thermal state using the Geophysical Institute Permafrost Lab version 2 (GIPL2) model across the QTP. Based on the single-point simulations, the model is upscaled to the entire QTP. The upscaled model is validated with five investigated regions (IRs), including Wenquan (WQIR), Gaize (GZIR), Aerjin (AEJIR), Xikunlun (XKLIR), and Qinghai-Tibetan Highway (G109IR). The results show that the modified GIPL2 model improves the accuracy of the permafrost thermal state simulations. Due to our simulated results on the QTP, the average ALT is of 2.30 m (2.21-2.40 m). The ALT decreases with an increase in the altitude and decreases from the southeast to the northwest. The ALT is thin in the central QTP, but it is thick in the high-elevation mountain areas and some areas surrounding glaciers and lakes. The largest ALT is found in the border areas between permafrost and seasonally frozen ground regions. The simulated results of the MAGT (the mean annual ground temperature) indicate that most of the permafrost is substable, which is sensitive to climate warming. The simulated results would be of great significance on assessing the impacts of permafrost dynamics on local hydrology, ecology, and engineering construction.					; Zhao, Lin/M-9536-2018; Wu, Tonghua/B-4202-2009; xie, Changwei/AAL-6165-2021; zhao, lin/M-9536-2018; Hu, Guojie/M-5738-2019; Zhao, guohui/NJS-5253-2025; wu, xiaodong/GYV-4997-2022; Wu, Tonghua/AAE-4563-2019	Hu, Guojie/0000-0002-5428-0445; Wu, Tonghua/0000-0002-5084-3570; zhao, lin/0000-0003-0245-8413; qin, yanhui/0000-0002-6765-1508; wu, xiaodong/0000-0002-4519-8378; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				NOV 16	2017	122	21					11604	11620		10.1002/2017JD026858	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JD026858													WOS:000417195500030

Water level fluctuations and the ecosystem functioning of lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH					African Great Lakes Conference (AGLC) - Conservation and Development in a Changing Climate	MAY, 2017	Entebbe, UGANDA					Hydrological regimes are key drivers of productivity and structure in freshwater ecosystems but are increasingly impacted by human activity. Using 17 published food web models of 13 African lakes as a case study, we explored relationships between seasonal and interannual water level fluctuations and 15 attributes related to ecosystem function. We interpreted our results in the context of Odum's ecosystem maturity hypothesis, as systems with higher magnitude fluctuations may be kept at an earlier maturity stage than those that are relatively stable. The data we compiled indicate that long-term changes in the hydrological regimes of African lakes have already taken place. We used Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to examine relationships between ecosystem attributes and seven physical characteristics. Of these characteristics, interannual water level fluctuation magnitude was the most frequently retained predictor in the regression models. Our results indicate that interannual water level fluctuations are positively correlated with primary and overall production, but negatively correlated with fish diversity, transfer efficiency, and food chain length. These trends are opposite those expected with increasing ecosystem maturity. Interestingly, we found seasonal water level fluctuations to be positively correlated with biomass. An increase in standing biomass is generally associated with more mature ecosystems. However, we found that less production and biomass occurred at high trophic levels in highly fluctuating compared to relatively stable systems. This synthesis provides evidence that water level fluctuations are a key process influencing ecosystem structure and function in lakes. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Yang, JH; Zhang, XW				Yang, Jianghua; Zhang, Xiaowei			eDNA metabarcoding in zooplankton improves the ecological status assessment of aquatic ecosystems	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL												Aquatic ecosystems are monitored worldwide using a range of biological quality elements that are morphologically identified. The environmental DNA (eDNA)-based approach has unprecedented advantages (e.g., high throughput, high efficiency and low cost) for biodiversity surveys in both freshwater and marine ecosystems compared with traditional sampling and image recognition. The use of eDNA has been mostly limited to biodiversity estimation, how to apply the eDNA approach in assessing the ecological health status is largely unexplored. Here, using zooplankton as an example, we examined the application of eDNA monitoring for ecological status assessment in an aquatic ecosystem. The results showed that eDNA monitoring reflected the spatial and temporal variations in zooplankton structure. Both species composition and bio-interactions varied significantly between sampling seasons (dry, normal and wet). A total of 60 different zooplankton indices were calculated based on eDNA monitoring and most of these indices were highly correlated with the level of water pollution, which was indicated by the water quality index in one or all three seasons. Both qualitative and quantitative eDNA-based biological indices were correlated with water quality. The season-dependent eDNA zooplankton integrity index (IZI) reflected the ecological status, and this method improves the timeliness of bioassessment.

An increase in methane emissions from tropical Africa between 2010 and 2016 inferred from satellite data	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Emissions of methane (CH4) from tropical ecosystems, and how they respond to changes in climate, represent one of the biggest uncertainties associated with the global CH(4 )budget. Historically, this has been due to the dearth of pan-tropical in situ measurements, which is particularly acute in Africa. By virtue of their superior spatial coverage, satellite observations of atmospheric CH(4)columns can help to narrow down some of the uncertainties in the tropical CH(4)emission budget. We use proxy column retrievals of atmospheric CH4 (XCH4) from the Japanese Greenhouse gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) and the nested version of the GEOS-Chem atmospheric chemistry and transport model (0.5 degrees x 0.625 degrees) to infer emissions from tropical Africa between 2010 and 2016. Proxy retrievals of XCH4 are less sensitive to scattering due to clouds and aerosol than full physics retrievals, but the method assumes that the global distribution of carbon dioxide (CO2) is known. We explore the sensitivity of inferred a posteriori emissions to this source of systematic error by using two different XCH4 data products that are determined using different model CO2 fields. We infer monthly emissions from GOSAT XCH4 data using a hierarchical Bayesian framework, allowing us to report seasonal cycles and trends in annual mean values. We find mean tropical African emissions between 2010 and 2016 range from 76 (74-78) to 80 (78-82) Tg yr(-1), depending on the proxy XCH4 data used, with larger differences in Northern Hemisphere Africa than Southern Hemisphere Africa. We find a robust positive linear trend in tropical African CH4 emissions for our 7-year study period, with values of 1.5 (1.11.9) Tg yr(-1) or 2.1 (1.7-2.5) Tg yr(-1), depending on the CO2 data product used in the proxy retrieval. This linear emissions trend accounts for around a third of the global emissions growth rate during this period. A substantial portion of this increase is due to a short-term increase in emissions of 3 Tg yr(-1) between 2011 and 2015 from the Sudd in South Sudan. Using satellite land surface temperature anomalies and altimetry data, we find this increase in CH4 emissions is consistent with an increase in wetland extent due to increased inflow from the White Nile, although the data indicate that the Sudd was anomalously dry at the start of our inversion period. We find a strong seasonality in emissions across Northern Hemisphere Africa, with the timing of the seasonal emissions peak coincident with the seasonal peak in ground water storage. In contrast, we find that a posteriori CH4 emissions from the wetland area of the Congo Basin are approximately constant throughout the year, consistent with less temporal variability in wetland extent, and significantly smaller than a priori estimates.

There have been some reports on the trace element (TE) levels in surface water of the KDL, but its deep water has been never studied. We measured 17 TEs (Pb, Hg, Cd, As, Cr, Ni, Co, Mn, Cu, Fe, Al, Sr, U, V, Zn, Zr and Ba) in surface and deep water samples and assessed their health risks for residential and recreational receptors. Copper, Zn, Ba, Ni, Mn and Pb levels in deep water were higher than those in surface water. Total TE level in deep water was higher in wet season, whereas that in surface water was higher in dry season. TE levels in both surface and deep water were much lower than the guideline values for drinking water and the protection of freshwater aquatic life, indicating that TEs in the KDL originate from natural sources. All HQ (hazard quotient) and HI (hazard index) values were below the risk threshold of unity. HI values for child were higher than those for adult, indicating that the health of children is at dramatically higher risk than adults. Arsenic and U for water ingestion were the primary contributors to total risk (HI), while V and Cr for dermal pathway. The presence of U and V, among the TEs which are major contributors to total health risk, reveals the necessity of monitoring of such less-studied elements in the surface water bodies. Carcinogenic risk values of As and Cr in surface and deep water were below the target risk of 1 x 10(-4). These findings indicated that TEs in surface and deep water of the KDL do not pose health risks to residential and recreational users. Thus this study may serve as a model for similar studies assessing health risks of multielements in freshwater bodies in future.					; Canpolat, Özgür/V-8270-2018; Çağlar, Metin/V-8853-2018; Eriş, Kürşad/AAA-3088-2021; Okan, Özlem/V-9790-2018; Varol, Memet/F-6797-2013	Eris, Kursad Kadir/0000-0002-7440-8709; Varol, Memet/0000-0001-6475-0570; 													0013-9351	1096-0953				NOV	2020	190								110012	10.1016/j.envres.2020.110012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110012								32763277					WOS:000576671000004
J	Dai, LY; Che, T; Ding, YJ; Hao, XH				Dai, Liyun; Che, Tao; Ding, Yongjian; Hao, Xiaohua			Evaluation of snow cover and snow depth on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau derived from passive microwave remote sensing	CRYOSPHERE												Snow cover on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) plays a significant role in the global climate system and is an important water resource for rivers in the high-elevation region of Asia. At present, passive microwave (PMW) remote sensing data are the only efficient way to monitor temporal and spatial variations in snow depth at large scale. However, existing snow depth products show the largest uncertainties across the QTP. In this study, MODIS fractional snow cover product, point, line and intense sampling data are synthesized to evaluate the accuracy of snow cover and snow depth derived from PMW remote sensing data and to analyze the possible causes of uncertainties. The results show that the accuracy of snow cover extents varies spatially and depends on the fraction of snow cover. Based on the assumption that grids with MODIS snow cover fraction >10% are regarded as snow cover, the overall accuracy in snow cover is 66.7 %, overestimation error is 56.1 %, underestimation error is 21.1 %, commission error is 27.6 % and omission error is 47.4 %. The commission and overestimation errors of snow cover primarily occur in the northwest and southeast areas with low ground temperature. Omission error primarily occurs in cold desert areas with shallow snow, and underestimation error mainly occurs in glacier and lake areas. With the increase of snow cover fraction, the overestimation error decreases and the omission error increases. A comparison between snow depths measured in field experiments, measured at meteorological stations and estimated across the QTP shows that agreement between observation and retrieval improves with an increasing number of observation points in a PMW grid. The misclassification and errors between observed and retrieved snow depth are associated with the relatively coarse resolution of PMW remote sensing, ground temperature, snow characteristics and topography. To accurately understand the variation in snow depth across the QTP, new algorithms should be developed to retrieve snow depth with higher spatial resolution and should consider the variation in brightness temperatures at different frequencies emitted from ground with changing ground features.

Fillets and, in selected cases, other body fractions (viscera, liver, and residual carcass) from 8 fish species were analyzed. The possibility of harmonizing the monitoring protocols was tested. Results suggest that the sampling season is not critical for PFASs and the total protein content cannot be used for normalization of tissue concentrations because PFASs bind to specific proteins. Moreover, the polar lipid content could be used to reduce the variability of PFAS concentrations in phospholipid rich fractions of fish such as viscera and carcass. The data comparison and analysis show that the PFAS contamination in lake fish is generally correlated with the degree of urbanization of the lake catchment; however, it is sometimes difficult to compare absolute concentrations in lake fish because the lake hydro-morphological characteristics play a substantial role in determining the chemical concentrations of persistent and mobile contaminants.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-19.

The present study aimed to shed light on the different types of polluted waters entering the lake from various drains, as well as to evaluate the zooplankton community, determine the physical and chemical characteristics of the waters, and study the eutrophication state based on three years of seasonal monitoring from 2017 to 2019 at 12 stations. The results revealed that Rotifera, Copepoda, Protozoa, and Cladocera dominated the zooplankton population across the three-year study period, with a total of 98 taxa from 59 genera and 10 groups detected in the whole-body lake in 2018 and 2019, compared to 93 species from 52 genera in 2017. Twelve representative surface water samples were collected from the lake to determine physicochemical parameters, i.e., temperature, pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, ammonia-N, nitrate-N, nitrate-N, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, dissolved reactive phosphorus, and chlorophyll-a, as well as Fe, Cu, Zn, Cr, Ni, Cd, and Pb ions. Based on the calculations of the water quality index (WQI), the lake was classified as having good water quality.

Water quality data for national-scale aquatic research: The Water Quality Portal	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Aquatic systems are critical to food, security, and society. But, water data are collected by hundreds of research groups and organizations, many of which use nonstandard or inconsistent data descriptions and dissemination, and disparities across different types of water observation systems represent a major challenge for freshwater research. To address this issue, the Water Quality Portal (WQP) was developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the National Water Quality Monitoring Council to be a single point of access for water quality data dating back more than a century. The WQP is the largest standardized water quality data set available at the time of this writing, with more than 290 million records from more than 2.7 million sites in groundwater, inland, and coastal waters. The number of data contributors, data consumers, and third-party application developers making use of the WQP is growing rapidly. Here we introduce the WQP, including an overview of data, the standardized data model, and data access and services; and we describe challenges and opportunities associated with using WQP data. We also demonstrate through an example the value of the WQP data by characterizing seasonal variation in lake water clarity for regions of the continental U.S. The code used to access, download, analyze, and display these WQP data as shown in the figures is included as supporting information. Plain Language Summary The Water Quality Portal (http://www.waterqualitydata.us/) makes available more than 297,000,000 water quality records from all 50 states. Users can search for records at, upstream or downstream of their favorite river or lake location. Water quality Big Data is accompanied with opportunities and challenges for computing, data analysis, and interdisciplinary collaboration.					; Paerl, Hans/ABE-7384-2020	Read, Emily/0000-0002-9617-9433; Platt, Lindsay/0000-0002-5799-6297; Winslow, Luke/0000-0002-8602-5510; Dugan, Hilary/0000-0003-4674-1149; Kreft, James/0000-0001-8088-7788; DeCicco, Laura/0000-0002-3915-9487													0043-1397	1944-7973				FEB	2017	53	2					1735	1745		10.1002/2016WR019993	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016WR019993													WOS:000398568800040

Assessing water quality via key environmental parameters and quantifying the respective influence of landscape metrics like landscape configuration, land use composition and topography, which can overall represent anthropogenic activities, can facilitate the development of improved water quality management strategies. However, few studies concentrate on the quantitative effect of these landscape metrics groups on the change of key water quality parameters. In this study, with Poyang Lake basin, we selected key factors of the 14 environmental variables for the cost-effective water quality evaluation model of the minimum water quality index (WQImin) by the random forest method and quantified the contribution of different groups of landscape metrics on key water quality parameters by redundancy analysis and variance partitioning analysis. The results indicated that six water quality parameters of ammonium (NH4+-N), total nitrogen (TN), permanganate index (CODMn), dissolved oxygen (DO), fecal coliforms (F.coli) and total phosphorus (TP) can significantly represent the overall water quality of the Poyang Lake basin. Based on WQImin, the water quality of Fuhe River and Xiushui River was significantly better than that of Ganjiang River, Raohe River, and Xinjiang River in Poyang Lake basin. The contribution of landscape metrics to water quality variation followed the order of landscape configuration (19.0-22.5%) > land use composition (5.2-20.2%) > topography (5.7-8.0%). Here, Build-up land was the environmental factor contributing most significantly to the variation in water quality at both spatial and seasonal scales (5.7-21%). Build-up land, Agricultural land, Contagion index and Cohesion index were positively correlated with TN, TP, CODMn, and NH4+-N and negatively with DO at different scales; Grassland, Forest land, Hypsometric Integral index, Slope, and Mean Shape index showed the opposite relationship. The influence of these landscape types changed with spatial and seasonal scales, more significantly explaining variations in water quality during the dry season and at buffer scale. Changes in water quality at the spatial scale were most sensitive to land use composition. Our results represent a basis for the improvement of water quality management.					; Zhang, Hongwei/KFQ-5336-2024; Wang, Xiaowei/AAJ-6512-2020	Ma, Zhifei/0000-0002-1792-4002; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				AUG	2022	141								109096	10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109096	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109096		JUN 2022											WOS:000856283800001
J	Tokatli, C; Varol, M				Tokatli, Cem; Varol, Memet			Variations, health risks, pollution status and possible sources of dissolved toxic metal(loid)s in stagnant water bodies located in an intensive agricultural region of Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												There are many reservoirs, ponds and lakes in the Meric-Ergene River Basin (Turkey), which is an intensive agricultural region. Since agrochemicals are extensively applied to the agricultural soils in the basin, these water bodies may be contaminated with toxic metal (loid)s (TMs). However, no study has been conducted to determine TM levels in the water bodies. In this study, levels of seven TMs (Cr, As, Cu, N, Zn, Cd and Pb) in surface water samples taken from 25 different stagnant water bodies (11 reservoirs, 12 ponds and 2 lakes) in the dry and wet seasons were measured and compared with water quality guidelines. In addition, spatial and seasonal variations, health risks, pollution status and possible sources of TMs were assessed. The mean As concentration of the lakes was significantly higher due to drainage water from paddy fields. The ponds had higher total mean TM concentration likely due to their low water volume. Surface runoff from rainfall caused the Cr, Zn, Cd, Pb and Cu concentrations to increase in the wet season. Only the mean As concentration of the lakes in the dry season was above the drinking water standards. Metal pollution indices showed low contamination of the water bodies in both seasons. Health risk indices indicated that As in the lakes in the dry season via ingestion exposure pathway may pose both non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks to the residents. The results of factor and correlation analyses showed that among the studied TMs, only As originated from anthropogenic sources. The findings of this study revealed that agricultural activities caused As pollution in the lakes, while the reservoirs and ponds were not significantly affected by agricultural activities. We suggest that the levels of TMs in all water bodies should be measured at regular intervals to check the quality of surface water.

Information on the abundance and distribution of cyanobacteria is fundamental to support risk assessment and management activities. In the present study, an approach based on Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis was used to estimate the concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chla) and the cyanobacterial biomarker pigment phycocyanin (PC) using data from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in Lake Chaohu (China's fifth largest freshwater lake). The approach was developed and tested using fourteen years (2000-2014) of MODIS images, which showed significant spatial and temporal variability of the PC:Chla ratio, an indicator of cyanobacterial dominance. The results had unbiased RMS uncertainties of <60% for Chla ranging between 10 and 300 mu g/L, and unbiased RMS uncertainties of <65% for PC between 10 and 500 mu g/L. Further analysis showed the importance of nutrient and climate conditions for this dominance. Low TN:TP ratios (<29:1) and elevated temperatures were found to influence the seasonal shift of phytoplankton community. The resultant MODIS Chla and PC products were then used for cyanobacterial risk mapping with a decision tree classification model. The resulting Water Quality Decision Matrix (WQDM) was designed to assist authorities in the identification of possible intake areas, as well as specific months when higher frequency monitoring and more intense water treatment would be required if the location of the present intake area remained the same. Remote sensing cyanobacterial risk mapping provides a new tool for reservoir and lake management programs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Subaerial and subaqueous calving is an important component of glacier mass loss but they have been difficult to track due to spatiotemporal resolution limitations in remote sensing data and few field observations. In this study, we used near-daily 3 m resolution PlanetScope imagery in conjunction with an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) survey to quantify calving events and derive an empirical area-volume relationship to estimate calved glacier volume from planimetric iceberg areas. A calving event at Thulagi Glacier in 2017 was observed by satellite from before and during the event to nearly complete melting of the icebergs, and was observed in situ midway through the melting period, thus giving insights into the melting processes. In situ measurements of Thulagi Lake's surface and water column indicate that daytime sunlight absorption heats mainly just the top metre of water, but this heat is efficiently mixed downwards through the top tens of metres due to forced convection by wind-blown icebergs; this heat then is retained by the lake and is available to melt the icebergs. Using satellite data, we assess seasonal glacier velocities, lake thermal regime and glacier surface elevation change for Thulagi, Lower Barun and Lhotse Shar glaciers and their associated lakes. The data reveal widely varying trends, likely signifying divergent future evolution. Glacier velocities derived from 1960/70s declassified Corona satellite imagery revealed evidence of glacier deceleration for Thulagi and Lhotse Shar glaciers, but acceleration at Lower Barun Glacier following lake development. We used published modelled ice thickness data to show that upon reaching their maximum extents, Imja, Lower Barun and Thulagi lakes will contain, respectively, about 90 x 10(6), 62 x 10(6) and 5 x 10(6) m(3) of additional water compared to their 2018 volumes. Understanding lake-glacier interactions is essential to predict future glacier mass loss, lake formation and associated hazards.					; Shugar, DH/A-3572-2013; Schiassi, Enrico/HDN-5980-2022	Schiassi, Enrico/0000-0002-7882-5913; Haritashya, Umesh/0000-0001-9527-954X; Watson, C.

Little evidence for the importance of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in mediating phosphorus cycling and contributing to eutrophication has been generated for aquatic ecosystems, especially in coupled river-lake systems. In this study, we examined phosphorus transport and redistribution in a river-lake system in the Lake Erhai basin by establishing the relations between phosphorus distribution and phosphorus sorption behavior on SPM, and predicted how changes in the quality and quantity of SPM might influence phosphorus cycling by laboratory experiments and modeling. During the wet seasons, TP pool shifted from being dominated by total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) in the Miju River and estuary regions (73 +/- 5%) to being dominated by total particulate phosphorus (TPP) (74 +/- 11%) in Lake Erhai. The detritus-SPM in the Miju River as a P-sink and phytoplankton-SPM in Lake Erhai as a P-source buffered TDP levels during the wet seasons, which attributed to P activity and phytoplankton-POC of SPM. Increasing SPM concentrations could enhance the P-buffering. When C-0;<= 5 mu mol/L and phytoplankton-SPM >= 16 mg/L, P release increased by 50%-300%; when C-0 >= 5 mu mol/L and detritus-SPM > 16 mg/L, P removal could exceed 30%. This study highlights two distinctive roles of SPM in regulating P cycling during transport from rivers to lakes. Especially the phytoplankton-SPM to buffer phosphate-limitation during algal blooms should not be ignored, which could provide theoretical references for the mechanism of continued algal blooms in mesotrophic lakes.

The number of research studies examining microplastic pollution in freshwater and inland water systems is increasing, but most research focuses on rivers, reservoirs, and lakes. This study investigated the spatial-temporal distribution, characteristics, sources, and risks of microplastics in irrigation water in Taiwan. The results showed that microplastics were widely and unevenly distributed along the irrigation system and were abundant at sites surrounded by a dense population and sites that received lateral canal and urban runoff input. The abundance of microplastics ranged from 1.88 items/L to 141 items/L, and samples collected in May had the highest microplastic concentrations. Polypropylene, polyethylene, and polystyrene were identified as the pre-dominant polymers. Fibers (36-64%) were the most typical and abundant shape, and 333-1000 mu m size (49-63%) and white/transparent (45-51%) were the dominant size and colors among all samples. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were used to assess the impact of the rainy season and typhoons and addressed the dramatic changes in distinct population densities. The polymer risk index was calculated to evaluate the environmental risk of microplastics in irrigation water, and the results revealed a high microplastic risk throughout the year except in November and January. This study provided a valuable reference and impetus for a better understanding of the microplastic profile and source apportionment in irri-gation water, which was important for environmental management.					; Chang, Ting-Wei/AAW-8876-2021; Hassan, Fahir/IAN-6655-2023; Jiang, Jheng-Jie/H-6031-2016; CHEN, KUANYU/ADS-2415-2022	Hassan, Fahir/0000-0002-2307-4251; Jiang, Jheng-Jie/0000-0002-2887-723X; 													0269-7491	1873-6424				FEB 1	2023	318								120858	10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120858	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120858		DEC 2022						36521719					WOS:000904904200005

This study, using in-situ spectral and CSPM measurements as well as Sentinel 2 Multispectral Imager (MSI) images, aimed to develop CSPM retrieval models and further to estimate the CSPM values of Poyang Lake, China. Sixty-eight in-situ hyperspectral measurements and relative spectral response function were applied to simulate Sentinel 2 MIS spectra. Thirty-four samples were used to calibrate and the left samples were used to validate CSPM retrieval models, respectively. The developed models were then applied to two Sentinel 2 MSI images captured in wet and dry seasons, and the derived CSPM values were compared with those derived from MODIS B1 (lambda = 645 nm). Results showed that the Sentinel 2 MSI B4-B8b models achieved acceptable to high fitting accuracies, which explained 81-93% of the variation of CSPM. The validation results also showed the reliability of these six models, and the estimated CSPM explained 77-93% of the variation of measured CSPM with the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) ranging from 36.87% to 21.54%. Among those, a model based on B7 (lambda = 783 nm) appeared to be the most accurate one. The Sentinel 2 MSI-derived CSPM values were generally consistent in spatial distribution and magnitude with those derived from MODIS. The CSPM derived from Sentinel 2 MSI B7 showed the highest consistency with MODIS on 15 August 2016, while the Sentinel 2 MSI B4 (lambda = 665 nm) produced the highest consistency with MODIS on 2 April 2017. Overall, this study demonstrated the applicability of Sentinel 2 MSI for CSPM retrieval in Poyang Lake, and the Sentinel 2 MSI B4 and B7 are recommended for low and high loadings of SPM, respectively.					李, 峤虹/GRF-2468-2022; LIU, Huizeng/AAE-5207-2019; Wu, Guofeng/B-8735-2018; 邬国锋, Guofeng/B-8735-2018; Zhou, Qiming/N-8735-2016	Wu, Guofeng/0000-0003-2275-6530; Zhou, Qiming/0000-0003-0934-0602; Liu, Huizeng/0000-0002-9018-985X													2072-4292					JUL	2017	9	7							761	10.3390/rs9070761	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs9070761													WOS:000406676800124
J	Ongoma, V; Chen, HS; Gao, CJ				Ongoma, Victor; Chen, Haishan; Gao, Chujie			Evaluation of CMIP5 twentieth century rainfall simulation over the equatorial East Africa	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												This study assesses the performance of 22 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) historical simulations of rainfall over East Africa (EA) against reanalyzed datasets during 1951-2005. The datasets were sourced from Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) and Climate Research Unit (CRU). The metrics used to rank CMIP5 Global Circulation Models (GCMs) based on their performance in reproducing the observed rainfall include correlation coefficient, standard deviation, bias, percentage bias, root mean square error, and trend. Performances of individual models vary widely. The overall performance of the models over EA is generally low. The models reproduce the observed bimodal rainfall over EA. However, majority of them overestimate and underestimate the October-December (OND) and March-May (MAM) rainfall, respectively. The monthly (inter-annual) correlation between model and reanalyzed is high (low). More than a third of the models show a positive bias of the annual rainfall. High standard deviation in rainfall is recorded in the Lake Victoria Basin, central Kenya, and eastern Tanzania. A number of models reproduce the spatial standard deviation of rainfall during MAM season as compared to OND. The top eight models that produce rainfall over EA relatively well are as follows: CanESM2, CESM1-CAM5, CMCC-CESM, CNRM-CM5, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, EC-EARTH, INMCM4, and MICROC5. Although these results form a fairly good basis for selection of GCMs for carrying out climate projections and downscaling over EA, it is evident that there is still need for critical improvement in rainfall-related processes in the models assessed. Therefore, climate users are advised to use the projections of rainfall from CMIP5 models over EA cautiously when making decisions on adaptation to or mitigation of climate change.

Recently many studies have presented interesting results at regional, continental and global scale with 14.25 m to 25 km spatial and 10 day to one year temporal resolution. However, surface inland water bodies can feature temporally rapid spatial changes caused by extreme events, seasonal variability as well as human activity. Such changes can occur on temporal scales which are below the currently existing dynamic water body products. While the daily temporal resolution of available sensors has not been exploited yet. In this study we present an approach which uses the full temporal resolution of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to generate a 250 m daily global dataset of inland water bodies based on spectral information and dynamic thresholding. Based on a combination of MODIS Terra and Aqua daily classifications, auxiliary mask layers and temporal interpolation, a global cloud and gap free time series of inland water bodies is produced. The presented results are validated with 321 Landsat images across the globe. The executed validation shows an overall accuracy of 96.3% with 7.8% omission and 0.5% commission error, and a kappa coefficient of 933% for pure water pixels. The presented results demonstrate the high potential for different applications requiring information of inland water body dynamics at high temporal resolution. Examples demonstrate that e.g. the filling and emptying of water reservoirs, changes and inundation cycles of natural water bodies as well as freezing and thawing of lakes can be analyzed at a highly detailed temporal scale.

J	Binding, CE; Pizzolato, L; Zeng, C				Binding, C. E.; Pizzolato, L.; Zeng, C.			EOLakeWatch; delivering a comprehensive suite of remote sensing algal bloom indices for enhanced monitoring of Canadian eutrophic lakes	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Early detection and comprehensive monitoring of inland water algal blooms is fundamental to their effective management and mitigation of potential ecosystem and public health impacts. With the spatial and temporal limitations of in situ sampling, algal bloom monitoring capabilities have been enhanced greatly by advancements in satellite Earth Observation (EO). Three turbid, eutrophic Canadian lakes (Lake Winnipeg (LW); Lake Erie (LE); Lake of the Woods (LoW)) have been the focus of Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) research and monitoring initiatives due to concerns over persistent degraded water quality from recurring algal blooms. ECCC's EOLakeWatch was developed to deliver a suite of useful, easily interpretable, and accessible EO-derived products to support algal bloom monitoring on these three lakes. Algal bloom indices, describing bloom spatial extent, intensity, duration, and severity were derived using the European Space Agency's OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) sensor for observations from 2016 to present and its predecessor MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) for 2002 to 2011. Results document widespread blooms on each lake, with maximum spatial extent of 21,641 km(2) (representing 88.1% of the lake area) on LW, 3070 km(2) (79.5%) on LoW and 5257 km(2) (19.7%) on LE. Bloom intensity showed seasonal and inter-annual variability on all three lakes, with a suggestion that LoW may be responding to reduced nutrient loads with a recent decrease in bloom intensity. Annual bloom duration on LW and LoW was on average 44 and 47 days respectively, while on LE blooms were significantly shorter in duration at an average of 24 days. Variance among the derived bloom indices was shown to be significant (i.e. the most extensive bloom was not necessarily the longest or most intensive), demonstrating the need for the indices to be used collectively, or for any single comprehensive bloom indicator to capture the variability of all individual metrics. Bloom indices are processed in a fully automated operational capacity, distributed in near-real-time through a web portal and collated into end-user-friendly annual algal bloom reports for each lake. These products go a long way to address existing monitoring gaps, delivering prompt, consistent measures of lake-wide algal bloom conditions required to provide stakeholders with early warning of bloom risks, identify areas of potential concern, quantify spatio-temporal trends, further understand bloom dynamics and drivers, as well as guide and determine the effectiveness of implemented management actions.					; Pizzolato, Larissa/AAP-2646-2021	Pizzolato, Larissa/0000-0001-5471-2597; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				FEB	2021	121								106999	10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106999	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106999													WOS:000604888900013
J	Cao, F; Tzortziou, M				Cao, Fang; Tzortziou, Maria			Capturing dissolved organic carbon dynamics with Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 in tidally influenced wetland-estuarine systems	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Estuarine and coastal wetlands are among the most productive, ecologically valuable, and economically important ecosystems on Earth. Through tidal inundation and lateral export, estuarine marshes exert a strong influence on the amount and quality of carbon and nutrients exchanged between the land and the ocean. Yet, current understanding of the role of these "blue carbon" ecosystems on estuarine optics, biogeochemistry, and ecology is largely based on limited field observations at point locations, due to the coarse resolution of existing and heritage satellite ocean color sensors. Here, for the first time, we merged high resolution data from the constellation of Landsat-8/ Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2A/B MultiSpectral Instruments (MSI) to examine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics in a tidally influenced marsh-estuarine system. Often referred to as the "Everglades of the North", the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge is the largest marsh system in the Chesapeake Bay and one of the most ecologically important areas in the United States. A multiple linear regression approach linking DOC to the spectral shape of water remote sensing reflectance was used to capture marsh DOC export and examine spatial features and temporal changes in DOC over a broad range of conditions (DOC in the range of 2.32-19.9 mg/L), across multiple years, different seasons, and tidal regimes, with a relative error (mean average percent difference) of 23%. Data consistency between satellite sensors was evaluated, followed by the generation of a long term, multi-sensor DOC data record that provided more frequent observations. Combining data from the three satellites revealed the strong impact of marsh outwelling at the larger ecosystem scale, its seasonal variability, and the importance of other environmental factors, including wind conditions, river discharge, and extreme weather events, in shaping DOC dynamics along complex, tidally influenced terrestrial-aquatic interfaces.

This study investigates the spatiotemporal variations of isotopic compositions (delta H-2 and delta O-18) in river and lake water to explore the river-lake interactions in combination with water level and discharge in Poyang Lake watershed. The results showed that river and lake water isotopes (delta H-2 and delta O-18) exhibited highly temporal heterogeneity across seasons but their spatial differences were not remarkable, which is closely related with water sources from local precipitation and groundwater, and lake hydrology. The homogeneous patterns of lake water delta H-2 and delta O-18 indicated that Poyang Lake is a well-mixed lake in spatial scales. By contrast, the river (10.7 parts per thousand) and lake (10.8 parts per thousand) water d-excess and lc-excess (0.6 parts per thousand) were close to precipitation d-excess and lc-excess suggesting that precipitation is the main source for the lake and river. The slope and intercept of the river water line were slightly lower than those of the local meteoric water line and lake water line, which could be attributed to a greater evaporative enrichment in river water impacted by water flow regulation in the watershed. Interactions between Poyang Lake and Yangtze River vary seasonally, as evidently shown by the variations of water discharge and isotope compositions in river and lake water. The delta H-2 and delta O-18 of the Yangtze River water become more positive in the downstream zone than those in the upstream zone, indicating that the water from Poyang Lake has a great impact on downstream river water. This result can also be demonstrated by the efflux rate from the Poyang Lake to the Yangtze River, ranging from 17.9 parts per thousand to 67.9 parts per thousand across seasons except for the outlier rate in October resulted from the backflow of water from Yangtze River to the Poyang Lake. The complex lake-river interactions between Poyang Lake and Yangtze River mainly resulted from the regulation of Three Gorges Dam and water discharge from Poyang Lake watershed. These findings of the complex lake-river interactions will help to improve understanding of the hydrological processes and transport of pollutants and solutes around the confluence zone of the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake.

J	Dettinger, M; Udall, B; Georgakakos, A				Dettinger, Michael; Udall, Bradley; Georgakakos, Aris			Western water and climate change	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The western United States is a region long defined by water challenges. Climate change adds to those historical challenges, but does not, for the most part, introduce entirely new challenges; rather climate change is likely to stress water supplies and resources already in many cases stretched to, or beyond, natural limits. Projections are for continued and, likely, increased warming trends across the region, with a near certainty of continuing changes in seasonality of snowmelt and streamflows, and a strong potential for attendant increases in evaporative demands. Projections of future precipitation are less conclusive, although likely the northernmost West will see precipitation increases while the southernmost West sees declines. However, most of the region lies in a broad area where some climate models project precipitation increases while others project declines, so that only increases in precipitation uncertainties can be projected with any confidence. Changes in annual and seasonal hydrographs are likely to challenge water managers, users, and attempts to protect or restore environmental flows, even where annual volumes change little. Other impacts from climate change (e.g., floods and water-quality changes) are poorly understood and will likely be location dependent. In this context, four iconic river basins offer glimpses into specific challenges that climate change may bring to the West. The Colorado River is a system in which overuse and growing demands are projected to be even more challenging than climate-change-induced flow reductions. The Rio Grande offers the best example of how climate-change-induced flow declines might sink a major system into permanent drought. The Klamath is currently projected to face the more benign precipitation future, but fisheries and irrigation management may face dire straits due to warming air temperatures, rising irrigation demands, and warming waters in a basin already hobbled by tensions between endangered fisheries and agricultural demands. Finally, California's Bay-Delta system is a remarkably localized and severe weakness at the heart of the region's trillion-dollar economy. It is threatened by the full range of potential climate-change impacts expected across the West, along with major vulnerabilities to increased flooding and rising sea levels.

J	Ustaoglu, F				Ustaoglu, Fikret			Ecotoxicological risk assessment and source identification of heavy metals in the surface sediments of comlekci stream, Giresun, Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL FORENSICS												Heavy metal (HM) pollution of river sediments is one of the most important problems encountered in the aquatic environments. The purpose of this study was to determine potential HM contamination in the sediments of comlekci stream and to assess the environmental risks associated with this contamination. To achieve these objectives, sediment samples were collected seasonally at three different stations, dried at 103 degrees C for 24 h, sieved to < 63 mu m, and analyzed for HMs with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The average concentrations (mg/kg) in the sediments were as follows: Iron (Fe) 8597 +/- 1726 > manganese(Mn) 297.7 +/- 48.42 > zinc (Zn) 60.09 +/- 46.52 > copper (Cu) 35.26 +/- 23.33 > lead (Pb) 19.91 +/- 11.01 > chrome (Cr) 7.89 +/- 2.78 > nickel (Ni) 7.01 +/- 3.33 > cobalt (Co) 5.77 +/- 1.32 > cadmium (Cd) 0.11 +/- 0.17. To determine the origins and the relationships of HMs, statistical methods such as Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis, principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis were used. In addition, potential ecological risks and toxicity to human health were determined by performing calculations of the geoaccumulation index (I-geo), enrichment factor (EF), hazard index (HI), hazard quotient (HQ) and lifetime cancer risk (LCR) and comparing data to sediment quality guidelines (SQGs). The average enrichment factors (EFs) of Fe, Ni and Cr were less than 1.5, which indicates that they come from natural sources, while the other metals were consistently higher (EF > 1.5), which implies an anthropogenic influence. According toI(geo) results, there is limited contamination of sediments by Cu, Pb and Zn. Average value of SQGs showed that there is no environmental risk for aquatic biota. Data of HI, HQ, and LCR indicate that HMs do not pose carcinogenic risks or non-carcinogenic hazards to human health.					ustaoğlu, fikret/AAP-4558-2020; USTAOGLU, FIKRET/AAP-4558-2020	USTAOGLU, FIKRET/0000-0002-8195-8557													1527-5922	1527-5930				APR 3	2021	22	1-2					130	142		10.1080/15275922.2020.1806148	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15275922.2020.1806148		AUG 2020											WOS:000559558500001
J	Gibson, JJ; Birks, SJ; Yi, Y				Gibson, J. J.; Birks, S. J.; Yi, Y.			Stable isotope mass balance of lakes: a contemporary perspective	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The theoretical basis for application of stable isotope mass balance of lakes is described for a range of climatic situations including low latitude, high latitude, high altitude, continental and coastal systems, as well as cases where the atmospheric boundary layer is significantly modified by the lake evaporation process. The effects of seasonality on isotopic offset between precipitation and atmospheric vapour and the slope of the local evaporation line are described. Atmospheric feedback and its role in labelling the isotopic composition of the Laurentian Great Lakes and tropical lakes is discussed. Several important considerations are suggested to improve parameterization of quantitative paleoclimatic reconstructions including use of assumptions that are appropriate for the climatic setting, for the atmospheric feedback situation, for salinity, and headwater setting. Potential for use of dual-isotopes to trace past changes in seasonality and input, and a dual-lake index method that can potentially be used to trace connectivity of lakes are presented. In cases where modern or paleo-evaporation systems may be under-defined there are inherent limitations in the degree of quantification that can be attained. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ilkic, M; Mestrov, M				Ilkic, Mato; Mestrov, Marko			FINDS OF ROMAN COINS FROM PAKOSTANE	VJESNIK ARHEOLOSKOG MUZEJA U ZAGREBU												Little was known about the history of Pakogtane until several years ago when important Roman remains were found in the sea near this north-Dalmatian coastal village not far from Biograd. Most of the money for archaeological research was contributed by local self-government bodies, and in 2004 a team headed by Professor Zdenko Brusic PhD, from the Department of Archaeology of Zadar University, carried out the first phase of submarine research. At that time they partly uncovered and documented an excellently preserved late-Roman ship's skeleton at a depth of about 2 m, approximately between the islands of Sv. Justina and Veli Skolj. They also found a wooden structure with piles and boards not far from the shore, beside the centre of Pakogtane. It was a system of pools that belonged to ancient salt-works. Several hundred metres to the south-east, at a depth of about 2 m, a Roman harbour was found beside the beach called Janice. Although only a small part of the submarine area has been researched so far, there are indications that there was an important harbour beside present-day Pakogtane dating from the time of Imperial Rome. The cultural stratum of the Roman harbour is very rich in various artefacts. We have so far opened two soundings of 2 x 2 m about 30 m from the shore. In the cultural stratum researched, which extends to a thickness of 90 cm, we among other things found two coins. Two other coins were found completely by chance beside the nearby shoreline. A fifth ancient coin was found, also by chance, in the Pakogtane hinterland on the shore of Lake Vrana (Map). We found the first coin during submarine archaeological research in the summer of 2004. It lay in a stratum of the sounding at a depth of 40 cm. It is unpatinated and is made of a yellow alloy known as orichalcum. It weighs 27.1 g and its diameter is 33.5 mm. (Fig. 1) In the centre of the obverse it shows the bust of Emperor Traj an facing right with a laurel wreath on his head. Inside the dotted circle is the legend IMP CAES NERVA[E TR]AIANO AVG GER DAC P M TR P [COS] V PP. On the reverse is the figure of the standing Spes, facing left. Around it is the legend S P Q R OPTIMO [PRI]NCIPI, and in the field the abbreviation S C. According to the second volume of Roman Imperial Coinage (RIC), this is a sestertius of catalogue number 519 that was coined in Rome between 103 and 111. The coin is well preserved and was probably not in circulation for a long time. We found the second coin in the sounding we researched in the winter of 2005. Unfortunately, it is in a very had state of preservation (Fig. 2) and the passage of time has made the scene on it almost invisible. All that can be seen, on one side, is a bust facing right. It seems to have been made of copper. It weighs 6.6 g and has a diameter of 28 mm. This indicates a regular as, a coin that was most frequently in circulation in the first two centuries. The third coin is definitely a copper as. It was a chance find made on the shoreline beside the ancient Roman harbour. Its diameter is 27.5 mm and it weighs 10.1 g. It was coined during the reign of Antoninus Pius (Fig. 3). In the centre of the obverse is his bust with a laurel wreath, facing right. Around it is the legend ANTONINVS AVG PIVS P P TR [P XViIII. On the reverse is the standing figure of Felicitas and the legend FELICI-T[AS CO]S MI, and in the field the abbreviation S C. The third volume of RIC shows this denomination under catalogue number 937. This as was minted in Rome between 10 December 154 and 9 December 155. The next coin, found by chance in the same place like the preceding one, is very badly preserved. It weighs 6.4 g and has a diameter of 27 mm, but it originally probably weighed more. The surface layer of the metal in which the scene was stamped has worn away completely (Fig. 4). Only the contours of a bust facing right can be discerned on the obverse, while the reverse very faintly shows a standing human figure. It was probably coined in copper. It seems that this too was an as, so it probably also dates from the first two centuries. The last coin differs fundamentally from the preceding ones. Its diameter of 37.5 mm makes it one of the largest coins. It weighs 14.6 g. It is well preserved, made of bronze with a greenish patina. It was minted in Lydian Philadelpheia during the reign of Trajan Decius (Fig. 5). In the centre of the obverse is the bust, facing right, of this Roman emperor, a native of Pannonia. He is shown draped with a laurel wreath on his head. Inside the dotted border is the Greek legend AVT K F M KV TP[AI]ANOC AEKIOC. The centre of the reverse shows a table with legs ending in lion's paws. On it stand two urns, between them two palm fronds. Under the middle of the table is a cantharos. This composition is accompanied by a legend in Greek, E Pi AVP POV Phi EINOV Pi Omega Lambda Lambda B Gamma AI APX A /Phi Lambda Phi I Lambda A Delta E Lambda Phi E/Omega N NE Omega[K]OP/Omega[N]. This coin belongs to the group of provincial coinage issued by many cities and regions throughout the Roman Empire. They differ from regular denomMations, among other things, by their limited circulation. Philadelpheia was an important city in the centre of western Asia Minor. It began to mint its own coins in the 2nd century B.C. As part of the Roman Ewire, the province coined money during various emperors, including Trajan Decius. However, we could not find, in available literature, a specimen with the same figural and textual content as the one found in the Pakogtane area. The scene on the obverse makes it very similar to a Philadelpheia specimen published in the second volume of Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum Deutschland Sammlung von Aulock Collection of Greek coins from Asia Minor (SNG Aulock, 1963: Tafel 98, 3085). The figural scene on the reverse, however, makes it close to a coin minted in that Lydian city during the reign of Caracalla (SNG Aulock, 1963: Tafel 98, 3080). In our search for a corresponding coin Ivan Mirnik, distinguished numismatist from the Archaeological Museum in Zagreb, gave us some valuable information (Also, we were helped by Peter Kos, director of the National Museum of Slovenia.). Their foreign colleagues Michel Amandry and Andrew Burnett found a record by Edo Levante indicating that there is only one other provincial coin like that from Pakogtane in the world. This coin has never yet been published, and the specimen mentioned above appeared at an auction (Fig. 6). We extend our cordial thanks to the aforementioned numismatic experts for this precious information and their goodness in sharing it. The large bronze coin of Lydian Philadelpheia was found by chance near Pakogtane on the shore of Lake Vrana not far from the locality called Crkvina. At its edge the coin has a hole so it was probably worn as a medallion. Perhaps it belonged to a sailor from that city. This would be logical because ships from the eastern Mediterranean docked at the Roman harbour near Pakogtane, which can be seen from many finds of various eastern-type cooking utensils. The few coins found in the sea in Pakogtane belong to denominations that were usually in circulation in the first two centuries, which corresponds in time with the other archaeological finds in this locality.																			0350-7165					NOV	2007	40	1					339	346																WOS:000438305800013

Measuring freshwater aquatic ecosystems: The need for a hyperspectral global mapping satellite mission	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Freshwater ecosystems underpin global water and food security, yet are some of the most endangered ecosystems in the world because they are particularly vulnerable to land management change and climate variability. The US National Research Council's guidance to NASA regarding missions for the coming decade includes a polar orbiting, global mapping hyperspectral satellite remote sensing mission, the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI), to make quantitative measurements of ecosystem change. Traditionally, freshwater ecosystems have been challenging to measure with satellite remote sensing because they are small and spatially complex, require high fidelity spectroradiometry, and are best described with biophysical variables derived from high spectral resolution data. In this study, we evaluate the contribution of a hyperspectral global mapping satellite mission to measuring freshwater ecosystems. We demonstrate the need for such a mission, and evaluate the suitability and gaps, through an examination of the measurement resolution issues impacting freshwater ecosystem measurements (spatial, temporal, spectral and radiometric). These are exemplified through three case studies that use remote sensing to characterize a component of freshwater ecosystems that drive primary productivity. The high radiometric quality proposed for the HyspIRI mission makes it uniquely well designed for measuring freshwater ecosystems accurately at moderate to high spatial resolutions. The spatial and spectral resolutions of the HyspIRI mission are well suited for the retrieval of multiple biophysical variables, such as phycocyanin and chlorophyll-a. The effective temporal resolution is suitable for characterizing growing season wetland phenology in temperate regions, but may not be appropriate for tracking algal bloom dynamics, or ecosystem responses to extreme events in monsoonal regions. Global mapping missions provide the systematic, repeated measurements necessary to measure the drivers of freshwater biodiversity change. Archival global mapping missions with open access and free data policies increase end user uptake globally. Overall, an archival, hyperspectral global mapping mission uniquely meets the measurement requirements of multiple end users for freshwater ecosystem science and management. (C) 2015 The Authors.

J	Du, HY; Cao, YX; Li, Z; Li, LN; Xu, HC				Du, Haiyan; Cao, Yuanxin; Li, Zhe; Li, Lina; Xu, Huacheng			Formation and mechanisms of hydroxyl radicals during the oxygenation of sediments in Lake Poyang, China	WATER RESEARCH												Seasonal flooding-drought transformation process of lake sediments lead to changes of dissolved oxygen and redox conditions and the resultant generation of hydroxyl radical (HO'). To date, information on HO' formation and its regulators in seasonal lake sediments is largely unexplored. In this study, a total of nineteen sediments were collected from Lake Poyang, China, with the formation and mechanisms of HO' during the oxygenation process exploring via the incubation experiments, Fe K-edge X-ray adsorption spectroscopy, ultrafiltration, and fluorescent spectroscopy. Results showed that the concentrations of HO' generated ranged from 3.75 +/- 1.13 to 271.8 +/- 22.81 mu mol kg-1, demonstrating high formation potential and obvious spatial heterogeneity. The yield of HO' formed was positively correlated with the contents of Fe(II), sedimentary organic carbon, and dissolved organic carbon, showing a general contribution of these reduced substances to HO' formation. Furthermore, application of Fe K-edge X-ray adsorption spectroscopy revealed the key species of sedimentary Fe-smectite for HO' formation due to its high peroxidase-like activity. Besides inorganic Fe(II), the sedimentary dissolved organic matters (DOMs) represented an important regulator for HO' formation, which contributed about 2-11% of the total HO' generation. Moreover, the DOM-induced formation potential was found to be highly related to the molecular weight distribution that the low molecular weight- (LMW, <1 kDa) fraction exhibited higher HO' formation potential than the bulk and high molecular weight- (HMW, 1 kDa-0.45 mu m) counterparts. In addition, the omnipresent mineral Fe(II)-DOM interaction in sediment matrix exhibited another 2-6% of contribution to the total HO' production. This study highlighted the importance of contents and species of Fe(II) and DOM in manipulating the HO' yield, providing new insight into understanding the formation mechanisms of HO' in the seasonal lake sediment.					; Du, Haiyan/AAQ-6795-2020; yu, yingying/GRR-7851-2022; Li, Lina/Q-9088-2018; Xu, Huacheng/E-6538-2013	Xu, Huacheng/0000-0003-1724-6720; 													0043-1354	1879-2448				SEP 1	2021	202								117442	10.1016/j.watres.2021.117442	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.117442		JUL 2021						34304073					WOS:000691216000004

And, it's essential to assessing the relationship between nitrate pollution and human health, which is called human health risk assessment (HHRA). In this paper, groundwater samples were collected for their nitrate content in a typical karst hydrogeological unit in East China during the wet and dry seasons. Then, a human health risk assessment was conducted using the four-step risk assessment process developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), which aimed to determine the potential risk posed to human health by nitrate in the groundwater. To make the assessment more authentic and objective, the drinking water and dermal contact exposure pathways were considered, and the people were divided into four groups, including infants (0~6 months), children (7 months~17 years old), females (18 years and older), and males (18 years and older), in the wet and dry seasons to determine the impacts of the exposure pathway, age, sex, and precipitation period. The results indicated that more than half of the groundwater samples exceeded 10 mg/L (measured as nitrogen), which is the drinking water standard of China. The children and infants had greater health risks than the adults at the same groundwater nitrate concentration, and those two groups need to be paid more attention; the adult females had a greater health risk than the adult males in the two precipitation periods, which shows that the order of the health risk was infants > children > adult females > adult males. In addition, the value of the hazard quotient (HQ) and the area of the adverse effects were both higher in the wet season than in the dry season, which explains that precipitation can affect the human health risk as well. The HQ caused by the drinking water exposure pathway was much higher than that caused by the dermal contact exposure pathway. This study can provide information for more effective and reasonable decisions to city managers for groundwater nitrate pollution prevention.					gao, shuai/HJA-3848-2022; zhang, hailin/HMP-1435-2023	Gao, Shuai/0000-0001-5948-4191; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				MAR	2020	27	9			SI		9274	9287		10.1007/s11356-019-07075-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-07075-w								31916171					WOS:000524949600039

Their lifestyles range from obligate parasites to saprophytes. Yet, linking the scarce available sequence data to specific ecological traits or their host ranges constitutes currently a major challenge. We combined 28 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing with targeted isolation and sequencing approaches, along with cross-infection assays and analysis of chytrid infection prevalence to obtain new insights into chytrid diversity, ecology, and seasonal dynamics in a temperate lake. Parasitic phytoplankton-chytrid and saprotrophic pollen-chytrid interactions made up the majority of zoosporic fungal reads. We explicitly demonstrate the recurrent dominance of parasitic chytrids during frequent diatom blooms and saprotrophic chytrids during pollen rains. Distinct temporal dynamics of diatom-specific parasitic clades suggest mechanisms of coexistence based on niche differentiation and competitive strategies. The molecular and ecological information on chytrids generated in this study will aid further exploration of their spatial and temporal distribution patterns worldwide. To fully exploit the power of environmental sequencing for studies on chytrid ecology and evolution, we emphasize the need to intensify current isolation efforts of chytrids and integrate taxonomic and autecological data into long-term studies and experiments.

Here, a total of 22 antibiotics and 4 sulfonamides metabolites were detected in lake water, sediments, and different depth of groundwater surrounding Chenhu Lake during the wet and dry seasons. N4-acetylsulfonamides (Ac-SAs), fluoroquinolones (FQs), and tetracyclines (TCs) were the main groups of antibiotics in the study area. In the whole lake environment, there were more types of antibiotics in the aquatic environments than in the sediments, and the antibiotics distribution was closely related to geographical location. Specifically, the average concentration of antibiotics in groundwater decreased with an increase in sampling site distance from the lake. All antibiotics, except oxytetracycline (OTC), showed a significant decline during the dry season that could be due to the implementation of lake conservation policies, which significantly helped reducing lake pollution. There were obvious differences in the distribution of antibiotics in distinct sedimentary environments. In the surface sediments, the antibiotics content in the reclamation and the perennially flooded areas was higher than in the lakeshore area. The hydraulic interactions in the perennial flooded area facilitated the deep migration of antibiotics into lake sediments. Correlation analysis revealed a good relevance between the distribution of antibiotics in lake water and groundwater. Redundancy analysis shows that dissolved oxygen and temperature were the main factors affecting the distribution of antibiotics.

J	Hilt, S; Grossart, HP; McGinnis, DF; Keppler, F				Hilt, Sabine; Grossart, Hans-Peter; McGinnis, Daniel F.; Keppler, Frank			Potential role of submerged macrophytes for oxic methane production in aquatic ecosystems	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Methane (CH4) from aquatic ecosystems contributes to about half of total global CH4 emissions to the atmosphere. Until recently, aquatic biogenic CH4 production was exclusively attributed to methanogenic archaea living under anoxic or suboxic conditions in sediments, bottom waters, and wetlands. However, evidence for oxic CH4 production (OMP) in freshwater, brackish, and marine habitats is increasing. Possible sources were found to be driven by various planktonic organisms supporting different OMP mechanisms. Surprisingly, submerged macrophytes have been fully ignored in studies on OMP, yet they are key components of littoral zones of ponds, lakes, and coastal systems. High CH4 concentrations in these zones have been attributed to organic substrate production promoting classic methanogenesis in the absence of oxygen. Here, we review existing studies and argue that, similar to terrestrial plants and phytoplankton, macroalgae and submerged macrophytes may directly or indirectly contribute to CH4 formation in oxic waters. We propose several potential direct and indirect mechanisms: (1) direct production of CH4; (2) production of CH4 precursors and facilitation of their bacterial breakdown or chemical conversion; (3) facilitation of classic methanogenesis; and (4) facilitation of CH4 ebullition. As submerged macrophytes occur in many freshwater and marine habitats, they are important in global carbon budgets and can strongly vary in their abundance due to seasonal and boom-bust dynamics. Knowledge on their contribution to OMP is therefore essential to gain a better understanding of spatial and temporal dynamics of CH4 emissions and thus to substantially reduce current uncertainties when estimating global CH4 emissions from aquatic ecosystems.

Transitions in Arctic ecosystems: Ecological implications of a changing hydrological regime	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Numerous international scientific assessments and related articles have, during the last decade, described the observed and potential impacts of climate change as well as other related environmental stressors on Arctic ecosystems. There is increasing recognition that observed and projected changes in freshwater sources, fluxes, and storage will have profound implications for the physical, biogeochemical, biological, and ecological processes and properties of Arctic terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. However, a significant level of uncertainty remains in relation to forecasting the impacts of an intensified hydrological regime and related cryospheric change on ecosystem structure and function. As the terrestrial and freshwater ecology component of the Arctic Freshwater Synthesis, we review these uncertainties and recommend enhanced coordinated circumpolar research and monitoring efforts to improve quantification and prediction of how an altered hydrological regime influences local, regional, and circumpolar-level responses in terrestrial and freshwater systems. Specifically, we evaluate (i) changes in ecosystem productivity; (ii) alterations in ecosystem-level biogeochemical cycling and chemical transport; (iii) altered landscapes, successional trajectories, and creation of new habitats; (iv) altered seasonality and phenological mismatches; and (v) gains or losses of species and associated trophic interactions. We emphasize the need for developing a process-based understanding of interecosystem interactions, along with improved predictive models. We recommend enhanced use of the catchment scale as an integrated unit of study, thereby more explicitly considering the physical, chemical, and ecological processes and fluxes across a full freshwater continuum in a geographic region and spatial range of hydroecological units (e.g., stream-pond-lake-river-near shore marine environments).

In the subtropical hilly region of China, we conducted a 1.5-year continuous and high-frequency monitoring of paddy water N and P concentrations, runoff N and P losses, and grain yield in a double rice-cropping system with different chemical fertilizer and pesticide application rates. The results showed that the high-risk periods for N loss were in the first 5 days after the base fertilizer (BF) application and the first 10 days after the topdressing fertilizer application in both early and late rice seasons, while the high-risk periods for P loss were in the first 5 days after BF application in the early rice season and the first 15 days after BF application in the late rice season. The N and P runoff losses in the early rice season were greater than those in the late rice season, due to that the N and P fertilizers use efficiencies were lower, and thus paddy water N and P concentrations were higher in the early rice season. The paddy N and P concentrations and N and P runoff losses increased significantly with increased fertilizer application rates, while the pesticide application rate did not significantly affect N and P losses. Therefore, special effects (e.g., avoiding high irrigation, fertilizer deep application) should be taken during the high-risk periods of N and P losses to reduce the N and P runoff losses in the double rice cropping system, especially in the early rice season. There are also potentials to reduce fertilizer and pesticide input without reducing rice grain yield for the double rice cropping system in the subtropical hilly region of China.

J	Cao, X; Zhang, J; Meng, HB; Lai, YQ; Xu, MF				Cao, Xin; Zhang, Jing; Meng, Haobin; Lai, Yuequn; Xu, Mofan			Remote sensing inversion of water quality parameters in the Yellow River Delta	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												In recent years, with the rapid socio-economic development of the Yellow River Delta (YRD), the pressure on the supply of water resources has continued to rise. The development of oil-based industries has also led to a series of ecological and environmental problems, such as wetland degradation and water quality deterioration. As an increasing number of rivers are getting polluted, resulting in the deterioration of their water quality, monitoring, managing, and protecting water resources in the YRD is particularly important. In this study, water quality monitoring data and simultaneous Sentinel-2 image data from April 30, 2020, to October 26, 2021, were used to construct an experimental sample in the YRD. Water quality parameters (WQPs) concentrations were correlated with Sentinel-2 image element spectral reflectance and sensitive bands were selected. An empirical method based on the characteristic bands was used to invert a total of six water quality indicators, namely dissolved oxygen (DO), permanganate index (CODMn), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-H), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN) and turbidity. The results show: (1) A total of five water quality inversion models for DO, TN, CODMn, TP and TN were effective in the areas of the Guangli River, the Tiaohe and the Branch River. The inversion accuracies of the five inversion models (R2of 0.6099, 0.9271, 0.9581, 0.8784 and 0.7387; RMSE of 1.2723, 0.3413, 0.9923, 0.0118 and 1.8476; RPD of 1.53, 2.08, 3.56, 2.76 and 1.53) indicated the feasibility of the water quality inversion method based on Sentinel-2 data using statistical theory for monitoring water quality concentration in the YRD. (2) The spatial distribution of water quality in the YRD was generally characterized by high water quality in the upper reaches and low water quality in the middle and lower reaches (except for some seasonal variations). Among them, the water quality of the upper reaches of the Guangli River was poor, with opposite trends in DO and TN concentrations. In the Tiaohe, CODMn and TP concentrations were not strongly correlated. However, CODMn and TP concentrations were high in the middle reaches where water quality was the worst. The TN concentrations in the Branch River decreased between 2020 and 2021, but the water quality is still in Category V. Therefore, continued attention and appropriate water quality management measures in the YRD are required. Further, by measuring water quality indicators at monitoring stations, regression-fitting equations for WQPs were established to obtain complementary multi-platform observations. Thus, the water quality conditions in the YRD region can be evaluated more accurately and quickly. The research results not only provide an important reference basis for the identification and monitoring of pollution sources, prevention and treatment of water environment pollution in the YRD, but also provide water security for socio-economic and ecological environment security.

We used a large, 25-member regional climate model ensemble from the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment and show that, compared to the control period of 1971-2000, annual mean near-surface temperature is projected to increase by more than 1 degrees C and 1.5 degrees C over most parts of the Greater Horn of Africa, under GWLs of 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C respectively. The highest temperature increases are projected in the northern region, covering most parts of Sudan and northern parts of Ethiopia, and the lowest temperature increases are projected over the coastal belt of Tanzania. However, the projected mean surface temperature difference between 2 degrees C and 1. 5 degrees C GWLs is higher than 0.5 degrees C over nearly all land points, reaching 0.8 degrees C over Sudan and northern Ethiopia. This implies that the Greater Horn of Africa will warm faster than the global mean. While projected changes in precipitation are mostly uncertain across the Greater Horn of Africa, there is a substantial decrease over the central and northern parts of Ethiopia. Additionally, the length of dry and wet spells is projected to increase and decrease respectively. The combined effect of a reduction in rainfall and the changes in the wet and dry spells will likely impact negatively on the livelihoods of people within the coastal cities, lake regions, highlands as well as arid and semi-arid lands of Kenya, Tanzania, Somalia, Ethiopia and Sudan. The probable impacts of these changes on key sectors such as agriculture, water, energy and health sectors, will likely call for formulation of actionable policies geared towards adaptation and mitigation of the impacts of 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C warming.					; Lennard, Chris/C-2120-2014; Dosio, Alessandro/U-9093-2017; Osima, Sarah/AAX-8988-2021; Ogwang, Bob/AAR-9204-2021; Jain, Suman/MCJ-3133-2025	Indasi, Victor/0000-0001-5957-4330; Lennard, Chris/0000-0001-6085-0320; Mwangi, Emmah/0000-0003-3838-0849; Gudoshava, Masilin/0000-0003-0315-9271; Dosio, Alessandro/0000-0002-6365-9473													1748-9326					JUN	2018	13	6							065004	10.1088/1748-9326/aaba1b	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aaba1b													WOS:000433551600003

A total of 42 phyla and 689 distinct genera were identified, which showed significant seasonal variation. Additionally, stratified variations in the bacterial community strongly reflected the vertical gradient and seasonal changes in water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and nutrition concentration. Furthermore, principal coordinate analysis indicated that most microorganisms were likely influenced by changes in water stratification conditions, exhibiting significant differences during the stratification period and mixing period based on Adonis, MRPP, and Anosim. Compared to the stratification period, 123 enhanced operational taxonomic units (OTUs; 29%) and 226 depleted OTUs (52%) were identified during the mixing period. Linear discriminant analysis effect size results showed that 15 major genera were enriched in the mixing period and 10 major genera were enriched in the stratification period. Importantly, network analysis revealed that the keystone species belonged to hgcI_clade, CL500-29, Acidibacter, Paucimonas, Flavobacterium, Prochlorothrbc, Xanthomonadales, Chloroftexia, Burkholderiales, OPB56, KI89A_clade, Synechococcus, Caulobacter or were unclassified. Redundancy analysis showed that temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, chlorophyll-alpha, total phosphorus, nitrate, and ammonia were important factors influencing the water bacterial community and function composition, which were consistent with the results of the Mantel test analysis. Furthermore, random forest analysis showed that temperature, dissolved oxygen, ammonia, and total dissolved phosphorous were the most important variables predicting water bacterial community and function community alpha- and beta-diversity (P < 0.05). Overall, these results provide insight into the interactions between the microbial community and water quality evolution mechanism in Zhoucun reservoir.					; Shilei, Zhou/AGM-5703-2022; Yang, Yuzhu/AAF-8865-2021; Li, Zaixing/HGD-7611-2022; li, zaixing/HGD-7611-2022; Huang, Shu/AFR-4893-2022	Shilei, Zhou/0000-0002-5497-0673; Li, Zaixing/0000-0003-1908-2432; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				AUG 1	2020	267								110456	10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110456	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110456								32421660					WOS:000533525100030

David A.; Xue, Jiantao; Lin, Xiao; Lu, Jiayi; Xie, Shucheng			Different temperature dependence of the bacterial brGDGT isomers in 35 Chinese lake sediments compared to that in soils	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												During the last decade, the distribution of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) in lacustrine sediments has been widely used to reconstruct past variations in lake temperature. A prerequisite for the application of brGDGTs to lacustrine paleoclimate reconstructions is to understand the sources of brGDGTs in lake systems and the processes that influence their distribution. In this study, we investigated the distribution of brGDGTs in core-top sediments from 35 lakes across China, with a broad mean annual air temperature (MAAT) range, but a constrained pH range, to explore the effect of temperature. The results reveal a contrasting response of MBT'(5ME) and MBT'(6ME) to temperature in lake environments compared to that in soils. The sedimentary distributions of 5- and 6-methyl brGDGTs exhibit different relationships with temperature, with most of the latter being correlated to MAAT while the former responding to temperature by only hexamethylated compounds. In both global and Chinese soils, most 6-methyl brGDGTs have no relationship with MAAT, but the distribution of 5-methyl brGDGTs is correlated with MAAT. The different behaviors suggest that communities producing 5- or 6-methyl brGDGTs might be different in lakes and soils. In addition, in lakes from cold regions (MAAT < 5 degrees C), the brGDGT distributions correlate only with warm season temperatures (April to October) but exhibit no correlation with cold seasons, suggesting a seasonal bias in brGDGT production in these lakes. This bias towards the warm season is not found in lakes from warmer regions (MAAT > 5 degrees C). Based on these results we propose new temperature calibrations for paleotemperature reconstructions in Chinese alkaline lakes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Numerous spatial modeling studies have been conducted on the QTP to assess the status of permafrost, project future changes in permafrost, and diagnose contributors to permafrost degradation. Due to the scarcity of ground stations on the QTP, these modeling studies are often hampered by the lack of validation references, calibration targets, and model constraints; however, a high-quality permafrost distribution map would be a good option as a benchmark for spatial simulations. Existing permafrost distribution maps for the QTP can poorly serve this purpose. An ideal benchmark map for spatial modeling should be methodologically sound, of sufficient accuracy, and based on observations from mapping years rather than all historical data spanning several decades. Therefore, in this study, we created a new permafrost distribution map for the QTP in 2010 using a novel permafrost mapping approach with satellite-derived ground surface thawing and freezing indices as inputs and survey-based subregion permafrost maps as constraints. This approach accounted for the effects of local factors by incorporating (into the model) an empirical soil parameter whose values were optimally estimated through spatial clustering and parameter optimization constrained by survey-based subregion permafrost maps, and the approach was also improved to reduce parametric equifinality. This new map showed a total permafrost area of about 1.086x10(6) km(2) (41.2 % of the QTP area) and seasonally frozen ground of about 1.447x10(6) km(2) (54.9 %) in 2010, excluding glaciers and lakes. Validations using survey-based subregion permafrost maps (kappa=0.74) and borehole records (overall accuracy =0.85 and kappa=0.43) showed a higher accuracy of this map compared with two other recent maps. Inspection of regions with obvious distinctions between the maps affirms that the permafrost distribution on this map is more realistic than that on the Zou et al. (2017) map. Given the demonstrated excellent accuracy, this map can serve as a benchmark map for constraining/validating land surface simulations on the QTP and as a historical reference for projecting future permafrost changes on the QTP in the context of global warming.

Anthropogenic climate change has altered primary productivity in Lake Superior	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Anthropogenic climate change has the potential to alter many facets of Earth's freshwater resources, especially lacustrine ecosystems. The effects of anthropogenic changes in Lake Superior, which is Earth's largest freshwater lake by area, are not well documented (spatially or temporally) and predicted future states in response to climate change vary. Here we show that Lake Superior experienced a slow, steady increase in production throughout the Holocene using (paleo)productivity proxies in lacustrine sediments to reconstruct past changes in primary production. Furthermore, data from the last century indicate a rapid increase in primary production, which we attribute to increasing surface water temperatures and longer seasonal stratification related to longer ice-free periods in Lake Superior due to anthropogenic climate warming. These observations demonstrate that anthropogenic effects have become a prominent influence on one of Earth's largest, most pristine lacustrine ecosystems.					; Johnson, Thomas/C-1423-2010	Johnson, Thomas/0000-0003-4630-6788; Reavie, Euan/0000-0001-8871-5809; Werne, Josef/0000-0002-7019-6024													2041-1723					JUN 9	2017	8								15713	10.1038/ncomms15713	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15713								28598413					WOS:000402963800002

Hot and toxic: Temperature regulates microcystin release from cyanobacteria	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The mechanisms regulating toxin release by cyanobacteria are poorly understood despite the threat cyanotoxins pose to water quality and human health globally. To determine the potential for temperature to regulate microcystin release by toxin-producing cyanobacteria, we evaluated seasonal patterns of water temperature, cyanobacteria biomass, and extracellular microcystin concentration in a eutrophic freshwater lake dominated by Planktothrix agardhii. We replicated seasonal variation in water temperature in a concurrent laboratory incubation experiment designed to evaluate cause-effect relationships between temperature and toxin release. Lake temperature ranged from 3 to 27 degrees C and cyanobacteria biomass increased with warming up to 18 degrees C, but declined rapidly thereafter with further increases in temperature. Extracellular microcystin concentration was tightly coupled with temperature and was most elevated between 20 and 25 degrees C, which was concurrent with the decline in cyanobacteria biomass. A similar trend was observed in laboratory incubations where productivity-specific microcystin release was most elevated between 20 and 25 degrees C and then declined sharply at 30 degrees C. We applied generalized linear mixed modeling to evaluate the strength of water temperature as a predictor of cyanobacteria abundance and microcystin release, and determined that warming >= 20 degrees C would result in a 36% increase in microcystin release when Chlorophyll a was <= 50 mu g l(-1). These results show a temperature threshold for toxin release in P. agardhii, which demonstrates a potential to use water temperature to forecast bloom severity in eutrophic lakes where blooms can persist year-round with varying degrees of toxicity.

U.; Norton, John; Xagoraraki, Irene			Five-week warning of COVID-19 peaks prior to the Omicron surge in Detroit, Michigan using wastewater surveillance	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is useful in predicting temporal fluctuations of COVID-19 incidence in com-munities and providing early warnings of pending outbreaks. To investigate the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater and COVID-19 incidence in communities, a 12-month study between September 1, 2020, and August 31, 2021, prior to the Omicron surge, was conducted. 407 untreated wastewater samples were col-lected from the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) in southeastern Michigan. N1 and N2 genes of SARS-CoV-2 were quantified using RT-ddPCR. Daily confirmed COVID-19 cases for the City of Detroit, and Wayne, Macomb, Oakland counties between September 1, 2020, and October 4, 2021, were collected from a public data source. The total concen-trations of N1 and N2 genes ranged from 714.85 to 7145.98 gc/L and 820.47 to 6219.05 gc/L, respectively, which were strongly correlated with the 7-day moving average of total daily COVID-19 cases in the associated areas, after 5 weeks of the viral measurement. The results indicate a potential 5-week lag time of wastewater surveillance preced-ing COVID-19 incidence for the Detroit metropolitan area. Four statistical models were established to analyze the re-lationship between SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater and COVID-19 incidence in the study areas. Under a 5 -week lag time scenario with both N1 and N2 genes, the autoregression model with seasonal patterns and vector autoregression model were more effective in predicting COVID-19 cases during the study period. To investigate the impact of flow parameters on the correlation, the original N1 and N2 gene concentrations were normalized by waste-water flow parameters. The statistical results indicated the optimum models were consistent for both normalized and non-normalized data. In addition, we discussed parameters that explain the observed lag time. Furthermore, we eval-uated the impact of the omicron surge that followed, and the impact of different sampling methods on the estimation of lag time					Zhao, Liang/MEO-6004-2025; Broz, Jan/E-6919-2018	Xagoraraki, Irene/0000-0002-8173-430X; Zhao, Liang/0009-0002-7034-4231													0048-9697	1879-1026				OCT 20	2022	844								157040	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157040	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157040		JUL 2022						35779714					WOS:000829463100010

Environmental nucleic acids: A field-based comparison for monitoring freshwater habitats using eDNA and eRNA	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES												Nucleic acids released by organisms and isolated from environmental substrates are increasingly being used for molecular biomonitoring. While environmental DNA (eDNA) has received much attention, the potential of environmental RNA as a biomonitoring tool remains under-explored. Several recent studies using paired DNA and RNA metabarcoding of bulk samples suggest that RNA might better reflect "metabolically active" parts of the community. However, such studies mainly capture organismal eDNA and eRNA. For larger eukaryotes, isolation of extra-organismal RNA will be important, but viability needs to be examined in a field-based setting. In this study we evaluate (a) whether extra-organismal eRNA release from macroeukaryotes can be detected given its supposedly rapid degradation, and (b) if the same field collection methods for eDNA can be applied to eRNA. We collected eDNA and eRNA from water in lakes where fish community composition is well documented, enabling a comparison between the two nucleic acids in two different seasons with monitoring using conventional methods. We found that eRNA is released from macroeukaryotes and can be filtered from water and metabarcoded in a similar manner as eDNA to reliably provide species composition information. eRNA had a small but significantly greater true positive rate than eDNA, indicating that it correctly detects more species known to exist in the lakes. Given relatively small differences between the two molecules in describing fish community composition, we conclude that if eRNA provides significant advantages in terms of lability, it is a strong candidate to add to the suite of molecular monitoring tools.					; Cristescu, Melania/H-3401-2018	Rennie, Michael/0000-0001-7533-4759; Cristescu, Melania/0000-0002-0854-4040; Littlefair, Joanne/0000-0002-4481-0211													1755-098X	1755-0998				NOV	2022	22	8					2928	2940		10.1111/1755-0998.13671	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.13671		JUL 2022						35730338					WOS:000819804300001

This ice-shelf collapse results in an increased flux of ice from adjacent glaciers(3) and ice streams, thereby raising sea level globally(4). However, surface rivers forming on ice shelves could potentially export stored meltwater and prevent its destructive effects. Here we present evidence for persistent active drainage networks-interconnected streams, ponds and rivers-on the Nansen Ice Shelf in Antarctica that export a large fraction of the ice shelf's meltwater into the ocean. We find that active drainage has exported water off the ice surface through waterfalls and dolines for more than a century. The surface river terminates in a 130-metre-wide waterfall that can export the entire annual surface melt over the course of seven days. During warmer melt seasons, these drainage networks adapt to changing environmental conditions by remaining active for longer and exporting more water. Similar networks are present on the ice shelf in front of Petermann Glacier, Greenland, but other systems, such as on the Larsen C and Amery Ice Shelves, retain surface water at present. The underlying reasons for export versus retention remain unclear. Nonetheless our results suggest that, in a future warming climate, surface rivers could export melt off the large ice shelves surrounding Antarctica-contrary to present Antarctic ice-sheet models(1), which assume that meltwater is stored on the ice surface where it triggers ice-shelf disintegration.

J	Qi, L; Hu, CM; Visser, PM; Ma, RH				Qi, Lin; Hu, Chuanmin; Visser, Petra M.; Ma, Ronghua			Diurnal changes of cyanobacteria blooms in Taihu Lake as derived from GOCI observations	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Using frequent and long-term measurements (eight times per day, 2011 to present) from a geostationary satellite sensor (Geostationary Ocean Color Imager, GOCI), this study investigates diurnal changes of cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa blooms (near-surface high concentrations or surface scums) in Taihu Lake, from which vertical migration patterns could be inferred. After proper atmospheric correction, a cyanobacterial index algorithm is used to quantify equivalent surface cyanobacterial density (sigma, 0-100%) at both pixel and synoptic scales from each cloud-free image, followed by analysis of diurnal changing patterns of sigma at both scales. Three typical diurnal changing patterns are identified from all images, which show distinctive and different seasonality from the long-term statistics. Spatial distributions of the "hotspot" regions where diurnal changes are most often observed have also been established. While the seasonality of the three patterns appears to be a result of seasonality in both temperature and light availability, large blooms only occur 1 d after major wind events. Based on several lines of evidence, we hypothesize that the diurnal changes of such observed surface bloom patterns are likely a result of vertical migration rather than horizontal dissipation/aggregation of cyanobacteria. The mean migration speeds inferred from either a simple model or a radiative transfer model (< 0.03 cm s(-1) or < 1 m h(-1)) are consistent with those reported earlier from laboratory measurements for certain cyanobacteria colony sizes. Complete understanding of the three types of diurnal patterns and direct validation of the hypothesis, however, require further investigations from field measurements.					ma, rong/GVU-3096-2022; Visser, Petra/NJT-4667-2025; Hu, Chuanmin/AAB-9604-2021	Visser, Petra/0000-0003-3294-1908; Qi, Lin/0000-0003-3433-3252; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2018	63	4					1711	1726		10.1002/lno.10802	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10802													WOS:000440928800017

This study investigated seasonal and interannual variations in the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and CO2 flux from Lake Wuli, a small eutrophic urban lake in the heart of the Yangtze River Delta, China, based on a long-term (2000-2015) dataset. The results showed that the annual mean pCO(2) was 1030 +/- 281 matm (mean +/- standard deviation) with a mean CO2 flux of 1.1 +/- 0.6 g m(-2) d(-1) during 2000-2015, suggesting that compared with other lakes globally, Lake Wuli was a significant source of atmospheric CO2. Substantial interannual variability was observed, and the annual pCO(2) exhibited a decreasing trend due to improvements in water quality driven by environmental investment. Changes in ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations together explained 90% of the observed interannual variability in pCO(2) (R-2 = 0.90, p < 0.01). The lake was dominated by cyanobacterial blooms and showed nonseasonal variation in pCO(2). This finding was different from those of other eutrophic lakes with seasonal variation in pCO(2), mostly because the uptake of CO2 by algal-derived primary production was counterbalanced by the production of CO2 by algal-derived organic carbon decomposition. Our results suggested that anthropogenic activities strongly affect lake CO2 dynamics and that environmental investments, such as ecological restoration and reducing nutrient discharge, can significantly reduce CO2 emissions from inland lakes. This study provides valuable information on the reduction in carbon emissions from artificially controlled eutrophic lakes and an assessment of the impact of inland water on the global carbon cycle.

A Speed Limit on Ice Shelf Collapse Through Hydrofracture	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Increasing surface melt has been implicated in the collapse of several Antarctic ice shelves over the last few decades, including the collapse of Larsen B Ice Shelf over a period of just a few weeks in 2002. The speed at which an ice shelf disintegrates strongly determines the subsequent loss of grounded ice and sea level rise, but the controls on collapse speed are not well understood. Here we show, using a novel cellular automaton model, that there is an intrinsic speed limit on ice shelf collapse through cascades of interacting melt pond hydrofracture events. Though collapse speed increases with the area of hydrofracture influence, the typical flexural length scales of Antarctic ice shelves ensure that hydrofracture interactions remain localized. We argue that the speed at which Larsen B Ice Shelf collapsed was caused by a season of anomalously high surface meltwater production.					; Robel, Alexander/ISA-7962-2023; Banwell, Alison/W-8180-2018	Robel, Alexander/0000-0003-4520-0105; Banwell, Alison/0000-0001-9545-829X													0094-8276	1944-8007				NOV 16	2019	46	21					12092	12100		10.1029/2019GL084397	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019GL084397		NOV 2019											WOS:000494348900001

Validation of IMERG Precipitation in Africa	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												Understanding of hydroclimatic processes in Africa has been hindered by the lack of in situ precipitation measurements. Satellite-based observations, in particular, the TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) have been pivotal to filling this void. The recently released Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) project aims to continue the legacy of its predecessor, TMPA, and provide higher-resolution data. Here, IMERG-V04A precipitation data are validated using in situ observations from the Trans-African Hydro-Meteorological Observatory (TAHMO) project. Various evaluation measures are examined over a select number of stations in West and East Africa. In addition, continent-wide comparisons are made between IMERG and TMPA. The results show that the performance of the satellite-based products varies by season, region, and the evaluation statistics. The precipitation diurnal cycle is relatively better captured by IMERG than TMPA. Both products exhibit a better agreement with gauge data in East Africa and humid West Africa than in the southern Sahel. However, a clear advantage for IMERG is not apparent in detecting the annual cycle. Although all gridded products used here reasonably capture the annual cycle, some differences are evident during the short rains in East Africa. Direct comparison between IMERG and TMPA over the entire continent reveals that the similarity between the two products is also regionally heterogeneous. Except for Zimbabwe and Madagascar, where both satellite-based observations present a good agreement, the two products generally have their largest differences over mountainous regions. IMERG seems to have achieved a reduction in the positive bias evident in TMPA over Lake Victoria.

Recent studies have shown that diffusive fluxes, ebullition and surface water CH4 concentrations can differ significantly within lakesspatially and temporally. CH4 fluxes may be affected at longer scales in response to seasons, temperature, lake mixing events, short term weather events like pressure variations, shifting winds and diel cycles. Frequent measurements of fluxes in the same system and integrated assessments of the impacts of the spatio-temporal variability are rare. Thereby, large scale assessments frequently lack information on this variability which can potentially lead to biased estimates. In this study, we analysed the variability of CH4 fluxes and surface water CH4 concentrations across open water areas of lakes in a small catchment in southwest Sweden over two annual cycles. Significant patterns in CH4 concentrations, diffusive fluxes, ebullition and total fluxes were observed in space (between and within lakes) and in time (over diel cycles to years). Differences observed among the lakes can be associated with lake characteristics. The spatial variability within lakes was linked to depth or distance to stream inlets. Temporal variability was observed at diel to seasonal scales and was influenced by weather events. The fluxes increased exponentially with temperature in all three lakes, with stronger temperature dependence with decreasing depth. By comparing subsets of our data with estimates using all data we show that considering the spatio-temporal variability in CH4 fluxes is critical when making whole lake or annual budgets.

This study presents a random forest classification approach for the retrieval of the wetland landcover in the arid regions by fusing the Pleiade-1B data with multi-date Landsat-8 data. The segmentation of the Pliade-1B multispectral image data was performed based on an object-oriented approach, and the geometric and spectral features were extracted for the segmented image objects. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) series data were also calculated from the multi-date Landsat-8 data, reflecting vegetation phenological changes in its growth cycle. The feature set extracted from the two sensors data was optimized and employed to create the random forest model for the classification of the wetland landcovers in the Ertix River in northern Xinjiang, China. Comparison with other classification methods such as support vector machine and artificial neural network classifiers indicates that the random forest classifier can achieve accurate classification with an overall accuracy of 93% and the Kappa coefficient of 0.92. The classification accuracy of the farming lands and water bodies that have distinct boundaries with the surrounding land covers was improved 5%-10% by making use of the property of geometric shapes. To remove the difficulty in the classification that was caused by the similar spectral features of the vegetation covers, the phenological difference and the textural information of co-occurrence gray matrix were incorporated into the classification, and the main wetland vegetation covers in the study area were derived from the two sensors data. The inclusion of phenological information in the classification enables the classification errors being reduced down, and the overall accuracy was improved approximately 10%. The results show that the proposed random forest classification by fusing multi-sensor data can retrieve better wetland landcover information than the other classifiers, which is significant for the monitoring and management of the wetland ecological resources in arid areas.

New viral biogeochemical roles revealed through metagenomic analysis of Lake Baikal	MICROBIOME												Background: Lake Baikal is the largest body of liquid freshwater on Earth. Previous studies have described the microbial composition of this habitat, but the viral communities from this ecosystem have not been characterized in detail. Results: Here, we describe the viral diversity of this habitat across depth and seasonal gradients. We discovered 19,475 bona fide viral sequences, which are derived from viruses predicted to infect abundant and ecologically important taxa that reside in Lake Baikal, such as Nitrospirota, Methylophilaceae, and Crenarchaeota. Diversity analysis revealed significant changes in viral community composition between epipelagic and bathypelagic zones. Analysis of the gene content of individual viral populations allowed us to describe one of the first bacteriophages that infect Nitrospirota, and their extensive repertoire of auxiliary metabolic genes that might enhance carbon fixation through the reductive TCA cycle. We also described bacteriophages of methylotrophic bacteria with the potential to enhance methanol oxidation and the S-adenosyl-L-methionine cycle. Conclusions: These findings unraveled new ways by which viruses influence the carbon cycle in freshwater ecosystems, namely, by using auxiliary metabolic genes that act upon metabolisms of dark carbon fixation and methylotrophy. Therefore, our results shed light on the processes through which viruses can impact biogeochemical cycles of major ecological relevance.

Reservoirs have received recent attention as they may generate high CH4 fluxes. Improved quantification of these CH4 fluxes, particularly their spatiotemporal distribution, is key to realistically incorporating them in CH4 modeling and budget studies. Here we report on a new global, gridded (0.25 degrees lat x 0.25 degrees lon) study of reservoir CH4 emissions, accounting for new knowledge regarding reservoir areal extent and distribution, and spatiotemporal emission patterns influenced by diurnal variability, temperature-dependent seasonality, satellite-derived freeze-thaw dynamics, and eco-climatic zone. The results of this new data set comprise daily CH4 emissions throughout the full annual cycle and show that reservoirs cover 297 x 10(3) km(2) globally and emit 10.1 Tg CH4 yr(-1) (1 sigma uncertainty range of 7.2-12.9 Tg CH4 yr(-1)) from diffusive (1.2 Tg CH4 yr(-1)) and ebullitive (8.9 Tg CH4 yr(-1)) emission pathways. This analysis of reservoir CH4 emission addresses multiple gaps and uncertainties in previous studies and represents an important contribution to studies of the global CH4 budget. The new data sets and methodologies from this study provide a framework to better understand and model the current and future role of reservoirs in the global CH4 budget and to guide efforts to mitigate reservoir-related CH4 emissions.					du, jinyang/LZE-5392-2025	Deemer, Bridget/0000-0002-5845-1002; Bastviken, David/0000-0003-0038-2152													2169-8953	2169-8961				AUG	2021	126	8							e2021JG006305	10.1029/2021JG006305	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JG006305													WOS:000688734500001

Here we investigated the occurrence and concentrations of 35 typical PPCPs in water, sediment, and freshwater mollusks (Hyriopsis cumingii, Unio douglasiae, Sinanodonta woodiana, Lamprotula leai and Corbicula fluminea) of the Dongting Lake downstream of the Three Gorges Dam. As results, 33 PPCPs were detected in water and sediment of the lake. Ketoprofen (not detected (ND)-292.8 ng/L, mean 91.1 ng/L) and roxithromycin (13.7-141.9 ng/L, mean 30.4 ng/L) were the primary PPCPs measured in lake water, while ibuprofen (ND-105.0 ng/g, mean 30.0 ng/g) and ketoprofen (ND-142.9 ng/g, mean 27.6 ng/g) were dominant in the sediment. Distinct seasonal difference in PPCP compositions was observed in both water and sediment of the Dongting Lake, potentially associated with the water-level fluctuations driven by the Three Gorges Dam operations. Ketoprofen and ibuprofen were also frequently detected in the soft tissues of freshwater mollusks, with concentrations of 42.5-1206.6 and 44.9-992.7 ng/g, respectively. Significant species-specific accumulation characteristics of PPCPs in mollusks were observed, with the highest total contents being reported for Corbicula fluminea (3.18 +/- 1.13 mu g/g). Moreover, gonads of mollusks were identified as the target organ to accumulate these compounds. Correlation analysis further revealed the strong associations of PPCP concentrations in mollusks with those in water and sediment, suggesting the importance of controlling dissolved and sedimentary bioavailability of PPCPs for ecological risk management in this freshwater lake ecosystems.

Therefore, in two tropical river basins (Nandu River and Wanquan River basins) dominated by rice-vegetable rotations in Hainan, China, pesticides were analyzed in 256 surface water samples in wet and dry seasons. Forty-one pesticides were detected, and total concentrations ranged from not detectable to 24.2 mu g/L. Carbendazim and imidacloprid were the two most prevalent CUPs, detected in 59.8% and 17.7%, respectively, of surface water samples at concentrations above 0.1 mu g/L. Chlorpyrifos was the main LP, detected in 9.0% of samples at a concentration above 0.05 mu g/L. The fungicides difenoconazole and emamectin benzoate, the herbicide butachlor, and the insecticide acetamiprid occurred in >= 12.5% samples at concentrations above 0.1 mu g/L. Surface waters typically (85.2%) contained 5 to 15 residues, with an average of nine. Seasonally, the concentrations of the 41 pesticides were in the order January > July > November > September. Spatially, the composition of the main CUPs (not LPs) was significantly different depending on position in the drainage, which also changed with seasons. Crop and pest types and wet and dry seasons were the key factors controlling the spatiotemporal distribution of CUPs and LPs in surface waters. On the basis of evaluations of the exposures to individual pesticides and the dominant combinations with >= 8 pesticides, multiple pesticides were likely a significant risk to aquatic organisms, although noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic risks to humans were low. This study provides valuable data to better understand pesticide occurrence and ecological risks in river basins draining areas with rice-vegetable rotation systems in tropical China.

However, to date, linkages between the optical dynamics of CDOM and dissolved CH4 levels remain largely unknown. We used multi-year (2012-2014) seasonal data series collected from Lake Taihu and 51 connecting channels to investigate how CDOM optical dynamics may impact dissolved CH4 levels in the lake. High dissolved CH4 in the northwestern inflowing river mouths coincided with high underwater UV-vis light availability, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), DOM aromaticity, terrestrial humic-rich fluorescence, in situ measured terrestrial CDOM, depleted dissolved oxygen (DO), stable isotopic delta H-2, and delta O-18 compared with other lake regions. Our results further revealed positive relationships between dissolved CH4 and CDOM absorption at 350 nm, i.e. a(350), COD, DOC, terrestrial humic-rich fluorophores, and DOM aromaticity, and negative relationships between dissolved CH4 and DO, delta H-2, and delta O-18. The central lake samples showed a major contribution of terrestrial-sourced molecular formulas to the ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry data, suggesting the presence of allochthonous DOM sources even here. We conclude that an elevated terrestrial CDOM input likely enhances dissolved CH4 levels in Lake Taihu.

Here, based on hydrologic and topographic data, we analyzed secular variations in hydromorphological characteristics and their influencing factors at Dongting Lake, the second-largest freshwater lake in China. The entire time series (1951-2014) was divided into four subperiods based on the anthropogenic modifications of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River, including the construction of the Lower Jingjiang Cutoff Project and the operation of the Gezhou Dam (GD) and the Three Gorges Dam (TGD). The results indicated that there were obvious stepwise decreasing trends in the annual water discharge and suspended sediment discharge (SSD) from 1951 to 2014. Seasonal differences in water discharge and SSD over the recent 60 years exhibited a tendency of "less flooding during the flood season and more drying during the dry season". Meanwhile, the deposition-erosion budget of Dongting Lake shifted from a deposition rate of 120 x 10(6) t/yr from 1951 to 2003 to an erosion rate of 2 x 10(6) t/yr with the serious degradation of the Ouchi and Xiangjiang deltas after 2003. The hydrological processes of Dongting Lake are dominated by different anthropogenic activities at different stages. The Jingjiang Cutoff Project is the main driver of the decreases in water discharge and SSD from 1967 to 1980. The operation of the GD along the Changjiang River and other reservoirs, as well as land-use changes in the Dongting Lake basin, should be responsible for the hydrological variations from 1981 to 2003. The high sediment retention rate, geometric adjustment of the channel, and flow regulation induced by the operation of the TGD are the main drivers for the hydromorphological variations in Dongting Lake in 2004-2014.

Here, we studied the taxonomic and functional communities of phytoplankton over three years in Poyang Lake and further examined the effect of water-level on these groups. Phytoplankton were generally dominated by diatoms across seasons, followed by cyanobacteria and green algae. Functional groups were mainly composed of organisms tolerant to fluctuating mixing intensities, such as group P, which was mainly composed of filamentous Aulacoseira granulata and showed a typical seasonal variation. Compared to the other physical and chemical variables of the lake, water-level showed a greater influence on seasonal variations in phytoplankton total biomass, taxonomic communities and functional groups. The influence of water-level on phytoplankton communities included two aspects: direct effects of biomass dilution and mixing and indirect effects of nutrient dilution and underwater light availability. Our results also indicated that the functional groups were more sensitive to water-level than the taxonomic communities, which was supported by the higher variation of functional groups explained solely by water-level. Collectively, these findings illustrate the direct and indirect effects of water-level on phytoplankton taxonomic communities and functional groups, and providing insights into how water-level can alter phytoplankton communities in a larger complex floodplain system.

J	Chen, T; Song, CQ; Ke, LH; Wang, JD; Liu, K; Wu, QH				Chen, Tan; Song, Chunqiao; Ke, Linghong; Wang, Jida; Liu, Kai; Wu, Qianhan			Estimating seasonal water budgets in global lakes by using multi-source remote sensing measurements	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The seasonal change in lake water storage (LWSsc) reflect periodic fluctuations of the basin-scale water balance. However, the role of LWSsc in regulating the water budget at the global scale has not yet been investigated based on straight-forward observations. Quantifying LWSsc is necessary, especially under the context of global change. Available in-situ measurements of lake water levels and volumes are still scarce. Therefore, the Global Surface Water datasets of Joint Research Centre and multi-source satellite altimetry datasets through mathematical statistics methods are used in this study to address this issue. We estimate the LWSsc of 463 lakes and reservoirs worldwide with areas greater than 10 km(2), which represent nearly 64% of the total global lake area and 93% of the total lake volume capacity. Results show that the global seasonal water storage variation of these examined water bodies is 1390.91 +/- 78.91 km(3), comprising 869.44 +/- 67.35 km(3) from lakes and 521.46 +/- 41.11 km(3) from reservoirs. The relatively large estimates of LWSsc are concentrated in North American and African basins. Among the watersheds, the seasonal fluctuations of lakes in the North American Lawrence basin make up the most substantial magnitude of 10.76% of the global LWSsc. The latitudinal direction zonality of LWSsc is relatively significant. The LWSsc is concentrated between 30 degrees N and 60 degrees N in the northern hemisphere and between the equator and 30 degrees S in the southern hemisphere. Considering the geographic similarity and climatological zonality, the global LWSsc estimates are also extrapolated to other lakes without direct satellite altimetry observations on the basis of the average rate of the examined lakes distributed in the same Koppen Geiger Climate Classification zones. The LWSsc is calculated with a consequence of 488.23 +/- 14.72 km(3) for these extrapolated lakes, indicating an estimate of 1357.67 +/- 68.94 km(3) for the LWSsc of the global natural lakes (>10 km2). This initial estimation of LWSsc at a global scale will greatly help the improvement of our understanding of the seasonal behavior of lakes and reservoirs in regulating global and regional water cycles and the contribution of terrestrial water storage to sea level rise.

This study has used FT-ICR mass spectrometry and comprehensive data evaluation to assess the molecular differences of SPE-DOM between lake column water SPE-DOM and sedimentary pore water SPE-DOM in 10 Swedish boreal lakes of the Malingsbo area, which were selected for their large diversity of physicochemical and morphological characteristics. While lake column water is well mixed and fairly oxygenated, sedimentary pore water is subject to depletion of oxygen and to confinement of molecules. Robust trends were deduced from molecular compositions present in all compartments and in all 10 lakes ("common compositions") with recognition of relative abundance. Sedimentary pore water SPE-DOM featured higher proportions of heteroatoms N and S, higher average WC ratios in presence of higher DBE/C ratios, and higher average oxygenation than lake column water SPE-DOM. These trends were observed in all lakes except Ljustjarn, which is a ground water fed kettle lake with an unique lake biogeochemistry. Analogous trends were also observed in case of single or a few lakes and operated also for compounds present solely in either lake column water or sedimentary pore water. Unique compounds detected in either compartments and/or in a few lakes showed higher molecular diversity than the "common compositions". Processing of DOM molecules in sediments included selective preservation for polyphenolic compounds and microbial resynthesis of selected molecules of considerable diversity.

Significantly higher total OPE concentrations (Sigma OPEs) were observed in the wet season (49.5-148 ng L-1) than in the dry season (5.00-45.7 ng L-1) suggesting higher input via tributaries discharge as well as wet deposition in the studied region. Whereas lower levels of TnBP and (triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) in wet season reflected their possible degradation under solar irradiation. Comparable levels of total Di-OPs (Sigma Di-OPs) were found in the wet season (3.41-13.9 ng L-1) and dry season (1.01-12.3 ng L-1). Tri(2-chloroethyl) phosphate and tris(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate were the main OPE components, while diphenyl phosphate, di-n-butyl phosphate and bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate were the main Di-OP components. High levels of OPEs and Di-OPs were found in Datong Lake suggesting possible local emissions potentially related to fishery activity in the land-locked lake. Samples at river mouths to the lake also have higher levels of target OPEs and Di-OPs, the results disclosed obvious discharges from tributaries in Hunan Province. Negligible non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks were determined based on the measured concentrations in source waters. A limited ecological risk aquatic organisms in the Dongting Lake was identified, with most risk from TPHP. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For the case of Lake Urmia basin, this study explores the value of different locally and globally available observation data for adjusting a global hydrological model such that it can be used for distinguishing the impacts of human water use and climate variations. The WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM) was for the first time calibrated against multiple in situ and spaceborne data to analyze the decreasing lake water volume, lake river inflow, loss of groundwater, and total water storage in the entire basin during 2003-2013. The calibration process was done using an automated approach including a genetic algorithm (GA) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). Then the best-performing calibrated models were run with and without considering water use to quantify the impact of human water use. Observations encompass remote-sensing-based time series of annual irrigated areas in the basin from MODIS, monthly total water storage anomaly (TWSA) from GRACE satellites, and monthly lake volume anomalies. In situ observations include time series of annual inflow into the lake and basin averages of groundwater level variations based on 284 wells. In ad- dition, local estimates of sectoral water withdrawals in 2009 and return flow fractions were utilized. Calibration against MODIS and GRACE data alone improved simulated inflow into Lake Urmia but inflow and lake volume loss were still overestimated, while groundwater loss was underestimated and seasonality of groundwater storage was shifted as compared to observations. Lake and groundwater dynamics could only be simulated well if calibration against groundwater levels led to an adjustment of the fractions of human water use from groundwater and surface water. Thus, in some basins, globally available satellite-derived observations may not suffice for improving the simulation of human water use. According to WGHM simulations with 18 optimal parameter sets, human water use was the reason for 52 %-57 % of the total basin water loss of about 10 km(3) during 2003-2013, for 39 %-43 % of the Lake Urmia water loss of about 8 km(3), and for up to 87 %-90 % of the groundwater loss. Lake inflow was 39 %-45 % less than it would have been without human water use. The study shows that even without human water use Lake Urmia would not have recovered from the significant loss of lake water volume caused by the drought year 2008. These findings can support water management in the basin and more specifically Lake Urmia restoration plans.

J	Chassiot, L; Lajeunesse, P; Bernier, JF				Chassiot, Leo; Lajeunesse, Patrick; Bernier, Jean-Francois			Riverbank erosion in cold environments: Review and outlook	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												This review article deals with bank erosion from the perspective of rivers affected by seasonal ice formation. These rivers drain half of the terrestrial land surface globally, and are mainly located in both periglacial and cold, non-periglacial environments across the Northern Hemisphere. This review is based on a literature survey of 126 publications (articles, technical reports, conference papers and book chapters) documenting case studies in temperate and polar climates. The first section details the global issues of bank erosion and pinpoints concerns specific to northern environments. The second section describes the dominant erosion processes (fluvial vs. terrestrial), mechanisms (mechanical vs. thermal) and typical landforms encountered in the literature. The third section reviews the environmental factors (hydraulic vs. non-hydraulic) controlling bank erosion, with a focus on the different forms of river ice. The fourth section deals with the spatial and temporal variability in bank-erosion processes, discussing the distribution of process dominance occurring at the reach scale and the catchment scale, and describing the temporal window in which each process dominates. The fifth section reviews the expected impacts on bank erosion resulting from climate-induced disturbances on hydrological cycles and from increasing anthropogenic pressures along riverbanks in northern countries. The relationships among erosion processes, environmental factors, climate change, and human impacts are summarized in a sixth section that introduces a new synthetic conceptual diagram of bank erosion. Research needs that should be investigated in the future are highlighted in the seventh section while the final section synthesizes all the aspects presented in this review.

J	Wu, JH; Xue, CY; Tian, R; Wang, S				Wu, Jianhua; Xue, Chenyang; Tian, Rui; Wang, Siting			Lake water quality assessment: a case study of Shahu Lake in the semiarid loess area of northwest China	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												A comprehensive assessment on lake water quality was carried out in Shahu Lake, northwest China, to provide valuable information about present lake water quality for decision making. Major ions, general parameters, bacteriological parameters, organics and trace metals monitored monthly in 2014 were considered. Monitored parameters were compared with quality criteria for surface water of China, and overall water quality assessment was carried out using an entropy weighted water quality index (EWQI) based on 20 selected parameters. Lake water quality was also assessed for irrigation purpose. The results show that the lake water is of Cl center dot SO4-Na facies with high salinity and COD. The geochemistry of the lake water is regulated by intense evaporation and human activities. TP, TN and F- are major inorganic contaminants, with over 50% of the water samples polluted by them. Oil, mainly attributed by leaky motor tourist boats, is the major organic pollutants in the lake water, with 10 samples (37.04%) showing higher oil content than the permissible limit. The concentrations of other inorganic and organic contaminants as well as trace metals are well below the permissible limits. The present study indicates that inorganic contamination in the lake water is more severe than organic pollution. The overall lake water quality, assessed by EWQI, is poor and very poor with SO42-, TDS, TH and Cl-being the dominant contributing factors. The lake water is suitable for irrigation in terms of alkalinity, but is unsuitable for irrigation from the salinity point of view. Accelerating the circulation and replenishment of the lake water is an important way of reducing contaminant concentrations. This study is important in providing comprehensive information on lake water quality for decision makers and valuable reference for international lake water researchers.

Very little is known about how they move and distribute from point sources such as wastewater effluents into the ocean. We chose Adventfjorden near the settlement of Longyearbyen on the Arctic Svalbard archipelago as a case study to investigate how microfibers emitted with untreated wastewater will distribute in the fjord, both on a spatial and temporal scale. Fiber abundance in the effluent was estimated from wastewater samples taken during two one-week periods in June and September 2017. Large emissions of MFs were detected, similar in scale to a modern WWTP serving 1.3 million people and providing evidence of the importance of untreated wastewater from small settlements as major local sources for MF emissions in the Arctic. Fiber movement and distribution in the fjord mapped using an online-coupled hydrodynamic-drift model (FVCOM-FABM). For parameterizing a wider spectrum of fibers from synthetic to wool, four different density classes of MFs, i.e., buoyant, neutral, sinking, and fast sinking fibers are introduced to the modeling framework. The results clearly show that fiber class has a large impact on the fiber distributions. Light fibers remained in the surface layers and left the fjord quickly with outgoing currents, while heavy fibers mostly sank to the bottom and deposited in the inner parts of the fjord and along the northern shore. A number of accumulation sites were identified within the fjord. The southern shore, in contrast, was much less affected, with low fiber concentrations throughout the modeling period. Fiber distributions were then compared with published pelagic and benthic fauna distributions in different seasons at selected stations around the fjord. The ratios of fibers to organisms showed a very wide range, indicating hot spots of encounter risk for pelagic and benthic biota. This approach, in combination with in-situ ground-truthing, can be instrumental in understanding microplastic pathways and fate in fjord systems and coastal areas and help authorities develop monitoring and mitigation strategies for microfiber and microplastic pollution in their local waters.					; Halsband, Claudia/B-7770-2008	Herzke, Dorte/0000-0001-9620-3053; Halsband, Claudia/0000-0002-8570-9056														2296-665X				JUN 7	2021	9								662168	10.3389/fenvs.2021.662168	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2021.662168													WOS:000663746400001

In 1991, 300 tons of eel perished in the western basin of the lake, while in the summer of 1995 30 tons of eel died in the eastern part of the lake. Investigations carried out to find the causes of these ecocatastrophes included measurements of certain biochemical parameters: the blood sugar level, and the acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1.1.7), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, EC 1.1.2.3), glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT, EC 2.6.1.1), and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT, EC 2.6.1.2) activities in the blood serum of the collected eels. In both 1991 and 1995, deltamethrin (DM), the active ingredient of the insecticide K-OTHRIN 1 ULV used against mosquitoes, was detected in the eels; in 1995 it was demonstrated in several other animal species, i.e., bream (Abramis brama L.), pike perch (Stizostedion lucioperca L.), and the common gull (Larus canus), and in sediment samples from the lake. Additionally, laboratory experiments were carried out to study the effects of DM on eels. In 1991, eels were collected from the western (the site of the devastation) and eastern basins of the lake. The eels from the eastern basin were used as controls. At that time, the AChE activity in the blood serum of the eels from the western basin was significantly inhibited compared to that in animals from the eastern basin (P < 0.05, Student t test). Eels from the western part of the lake had GOT and GPT levels 20 and 100 %, respectively, higher than those of eels from the eastern part of the lake. The blood glucose level was much higher in the eels from the affected area of the lake as compared to those from the eastern part. The brain and liver of the eels contained DM residues at 20 mu g/kg wet tissue (Gonczy, 1992). Gonczy suspected that one of the causes of the massive eel loss in 1991 was the presence of DM in the fish. In 1995, when the eel devastation occurred in the eastern basin, moribund and surviving eels were collected from this part of the lake. The AChE activity was significantly inhibited in the blood serum of the dying eels as compared to that in surviving animals (P < 0.05, Student t test). The blood glucose content exhibited a difference too: it was 2.5 times higher in the dying eels than in the surviving ones. A huge increase in the LDH level was measured in the dying eels, indicating damage to different muscle tissues to an extent never observed previously. The GOT activities of the serum mere twice as high in the dying eels as in the living fish. The GPT was not significantly changed in the serum of dying eels as compared to the surviving animals. DM was detected in different tissue samples of the dying eels: 2.7-18.5 mu g/kg in the liver, 9.0-31.1 mu g/kg in the gill, and 3.0 mu g/kg wet tissue in the muscle. DM residues were found in tissue samples from other animals, in the following concentrations: 0.4 mu g/kg in bream, 2.1 mu g/kg in pike perch, 1.1 mu g/kg wet tissue in dead gulls. The sediment samples collected from different places and at different times contained DM in a concentration of 5.5-30.0 mu g/kg wet sediment at the time of the eel deaths, while the sediment samples collected from the same places a month later still contained DM at 7.0-8.8 mu g/kg wet sediment. Laboratory experiments with the insecticide K-OTHRIN 1 ULV revealed that 1.0 mu g/liter of its active ingredient, DM, caused the death of 50% of the eels after an incubation time of 96 hr. In the liver of the dead eels, DM was detected at 2.9-20.0 mu g/kg wet tissue. All the above-mentioned changes and the DM residue detected in the eels appear to demonstrate the contribution of DM in the severe eel devastation. This finding on the ecological risk of such types of insecticides might be useful in their further application.

J	He, Y; Wang, QM; He, W; Xu, FL				He, Yong; Wang, Qingmei; He, Wei; Xu, Fuliu			The occurrence, composition and partitioning of phthalate esters (PAEs) in the water-suspended particulate matter (SPM) system of Lake Chaohu, China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The occurrence, composition, and partitioning of six phthalate esters (PAEs) (dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) and di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP)) in the water-suspended particulate matter (SPM) system of Lake Chaohu were investigated in this study. Our results showed that PAEswere ubiquitous contaminants in Lake Chaohu. The concentration of the Sigma(6) PAEs in dissolved and particulate phases ranged from 0.370 to 13.2 mu g.L-1 and from 14.4 to 7129 mu g.L-1, respectively. The Sigma(6) PAEs in water and SPM phases exhibited different seasonal trends. PAEs with different degrees of hydrophobicity demonstrated different temporal distributions in the dissolved phase. In particulate phase, all PAEs exhibited the same temporal distribution. Regarding the occurrence of PAEs, significant spatial differences exist between lake and estuary. However, there were no specific differences in PAEs across lake zones and river types of Lake Chaohu. River input should be considered an important source of PAEs in Lake Chaohu. DIBP and DBP were the most abundant PAEs in Lake Chaohu, and DIBP should attract more attention in the future. The organic carbon normalized partitioning coefficient (logKoc) ranged froman average of 2.38 +/- 0.86L.g(-1) for BBP to 3.9 8 +/- 0.66 L.g(-1) for DEHP, and approximately 2 to 3 unit variations of logKoc existed for the individual PAEs. It was difficult to ascertain whether the partitioning of PAEs was in, near or far from the equilibrium. No linear relationship was found between logKoc and the octanol-water partitioning coefficient (logKow) for PAEs. Koc might not be suitable for describing the partitioning of PAEs in the water-SPM system. The hydrophobicity of PAEs may have little impact on their partitioning in the complex environmental system, and the Kow model may be inappropriate to predict the partitioning of PAEs in natural large lakes.

Therefore, it is of great significance to investigate large potential landslides along the Jinsha River. In this paper, we inspect the deformation characteristics of a rapid landsliding area along the Jinsha River by using multi-temporal remote sensing, and analyzed its future development and risk to the Sichuan-Tibet railway. Surface deformations and damage features between January 2016 and October 2020 were obtained using multi-temporal InSAR and multi-temporal correlations of optical images, respectively. Deformation and failure signs obtained from the field investigation were highly consistent. Results showed that cumulative deformation of the landsliding area is more than 50 cm, and the landsliding area is undergoing an accelerated deformation stage. The external rainfall condition, water level, and water flow rate are important factors controlling the deformation. The increase of rainfall, the rise of water level, and faster flow rate will accelerate the deformation of slope. The geological conditions of the slope itself affect the deformation of landslide. Due to the enrichment of gently dipping gneiss and groundwater, the slope is more likely to slide along the slope. The Jinsha River continuously scours the concave bank of the slope, causing local collapses and forming local free surfaces. Numerical simulation results show that once the landsliding area fails, the landslide body may form a 4-km-long dammed lake, and the water level could rise about 200 m; the historic data shows that landslide dam may burst in 2-8 days after sliding. Therefore, strategies of landslide hazard mitigation in the study area should be particularly made for the coming rainy seasons to mitigate risks from the landsliding area.					yao, jiaming/ONK-1143-2025; Cao, Yiming/D-3541-2013; Zhou, Chaodong/HNQ-1424-2023; Wu, Yuming/LMP-5267-2024; LI, Langping/JRX-5874-2023; Lan, Hengxing/JPK-8395-2023	yao, jiaming/0000-0003-0332-402X; Lan, Hengxing/0000-0002-7146-932X; 													1612-510X	1612-5118				MAR	2022	19	3					703	718		10.1007/s10346-021-01790-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10346-021-01790-7		JAN 2022											WOS:000740640700002

The traditional satellite radar altimeters normally monitor water level changes of large lakes and reservoirs (i.e., greater than 1 km(2)) around the world. Fortunately, the recent Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) makes it possible to monitor water level changes for some small lakes and reservoirs (i.e., less than 1 km(2)). ICESat-2 ATL13 products provide observations of inland water surface heights, which are suitable for water level estimation at a global scale. In this study, ICESat-2 ATL13 products were used to conduct a global estimation and assessment of lake/reservoir water level changes. We produced monthly water levels for 13,843 lakes and reservoirs with areas greater than 0.1 km(2) and all-season ATL13 products across the globe, in which 2257 targets are smaller than 1 km(2). In total, the average valid number of months covered by ICESat-2 is 5.41 months and only 204 of 13,843 lakes and reservoirs have water levels in all the months in 2019. In situ water level data from 21 gauge stations across the United States and 12 gauge stations across Australia were collected to assess the monthly lake/reservoir water levels, which exhibited a high accuracy (RMSE = 0.08 m, r = 0.999). According to comparisons between the monthly water levels and changes from ATL08 products in another study and ATL13 products in this study, we found that both products can accurately estimate the monthly water level of lakes and reservoirs, but water levels derived from ATL13 products exhibited a higher accuracy compared with water levels derived from ATL08 products (RMSE = 0.28 m, r = 0.999). In general, the ATL13 product is more convenient because the HydroLAKES mask of inland water bodies, the orthometric height (with respect to the EGM2008 geoid) of water surfaces, and several data quality parameters specific to water surfaces were involved in the ATL13 product.					; XU, nan/KDP-0628-2024; Wang, Xiaohua/AAH-5067-2020; ma, yue/GXE-9897-2022	Xu, Nan/0000-0001-9912-2347; Wang, Xiao Hua/0000-0002-1774-6189; Yang, Jian/0000-0001-9691-5595; ma, yue/0000-0003-1241-8650; 														2072-4292				JUL	2021	13	14							2744	10.3390/rs13142744	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13142744													WOS:000676898200001

The 28 sampling stations were divided into two periods (wet season and dry season) and two regions (low pollution and high pollution), respectively, using hierarchical CA method. Four parameters (temperature, pH, ammonia-nitrogen (NH4-N), and total nitrogen (TN)) were identified using DA to distinguish temporal groups with close to 97.86% correct assignations. Again using DA, five parameters (pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD), TN, Fluoride (F), and Sulphide (S)) led to 93.75% correct assignations for distinguishing spatial groups. Five potential pollution sources including nutrients pollution, oxygen consuming organic pollution, fluorine chemical pollution, heavy metals pollution and natural pollution, were identified using PCA/FA techniques for both the low pollution region and the high pollution region. Heavy metals (Cuprum (Cu), chromium (Cr) and Zinc (Zn)), fluoride and sulfide are of particular concern in the study region because of many open-pit copper mines such as Dexing Copper Mine. Results obtained from this study offer a reasonable classification scheme for low-cost monitoring networks. The results also inform understanding of spatio-temporal variation in water quality as these topics relate to water resources management.					he, bin/AAV-6319-2021; DUAN, Weili/A-1928-2019; Zou, Shan/HTN-7391-2023; Duan, Weili/D-2895-2009	Zou, Shan/0000-0003-3896-5679; DUAN, Weili/0000-0002-1503-8066; He, Bin/0000-0002-7224-9214														2071-1050				FEB	2016	8	2							133	10.3390/su8020133	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su8020133													WOS:000371830100015

Free-living (FL) and particle-attached (PA) bacterial communities play a primary role in mediating biogeochemical processes in these lakes and in responding to eutrophication. However, knowledge of factors governing function, assembly mechanisms, and co-occurrence patterns of these communities remain poorly understood and are key challenges in microbial ecology. To address this knowledge gap, we collected 96 samples from Lake Taihu across four seasons and investigated the bacterial community using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Our results demonstrate that the alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, community composition, and functional composition of FL and PA bacterial communities exhibited differing spatiotemporal dynamics. FL and PA bacterial communities displayed similar distance-decay relationships across seasons. Deterministic processes (i.e., environmental filtering and species interaction) were the primary factors shaping community assembly in both FL and PA bacteria. Similar environmental factors shaped bacterial community structure while different environmental factors drove bacterial functional composition. Habitat filtering influenced enrichment of bacteria within specific functional groups. Among them, the FL bacterial community appeared to play a critical role in methane-utilization, whereas the PA bacteria contributed more to biogeochemical cycling of carbon. FL and PA bacterial communities exhibited distinct co-occurrence pattern across different seasons. In the FL network, Methylotenera and Methylophilaceae were identified as keystone taxa, while Burkholderiaceae and the hgcI clade were keystone taxa in the PA network. The PA bacterial community appeared to possess greater stability in the face of environmental change than did FL counterparts. These results broaden our knowledge of the driving factors, co-occurrence patterns, and assembly processes in FL and PA bacterial communities in eutrophic ecosystems and provide improved insight into the underlying mechanisms responsible for these results.

Diel, seasonal, and inter-annual variation in carbon dioxide effluxes from lakes and reservoirs	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Accounting for temporal changes in carbon dioxide (CO2) effluxes from freshwaters remains a challenge for global and regional carbon budgets. Here, we synthesize 171 site-months of flux measurements of CO2 based on the eddy covariance method from 13 lakes and reservoirs in the Northern Hemisphere, and quantify dynamics at multiple temporal scales. We found pronounced sub-annual variability in CO2 flux at all sites. By accounting for diel variation, only 11% of site-months were net daily sinks of CO2. Annual CO2 emissions had an average of 25% (range 3%-58%) interannual variation. Similar to studies on streams, nighttime emissions regularly exceeded daytime emissions. Biophysical regulations of CO2 flux variability were delineated through mutual information analysis. Sample analysis of CO2 fluxes indicate the importance of continuous measurements. Better characterization of short- and long-term variability is necessary to understand and improve detection of temporal changes of CO2 fluxes in response to natural and anthropogenic drivers. Our results indicate that existing global lake carbon budgets relying primarily on daytime measurements yield underestimates of net emissions.

Using High-Resolution Satellite Imagery and Deep Learning to Track Dynamic Seasonality in Small Water Bodies	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Small water bodies (i.e., ponds; <0.01 km(2)) play an important role in Earth System processes, including carbon cycling and emissions of methane. Detection and monitoring of ponds using satellite imagery has been extremely difficult and many water maps are biased toward lakes (>0.01 km(2)). We leverage high-resolution (3 m) optical satellite imagery from Planet Labs and deep learning methods to map seasonal changes in pond and lake areal extent across four regions in Alaska. Our water maps indicate that changes in open water extent over the snow-free season are especially pronounced in ponds. To investigate potential impacts of seasonal changes in pond area on carbon emissions, we provide a case study of open water methane emission budgets using the new water maps. Our approach has widespread applications for water resources, habitat and land cover change assessments, wildlife management, risk assessments, and other biogeochemical modeling efforts.					; Kyzivat, Ethan/HDO-0105-2022; Miller, Charles/G-7854-2017; Yang, Yili/LBH-8996-2024	Mullen, Andrew/0000-0002-9127-9996; Rogers, Brendan/0000-0001-6711-8466; Caraballo-Vega, Jordan/0000-0001-9125-5591; , Eric/0000-0002-0615-0160; Bredder, Allison/0000-0002-3741-2477; Rickenbaugh, Lila/0000-0001-9865-6646; Hung, Jacqueline/0000-0001-5245-0896; Kyzivat, Ethan/0000-0002-4748-2938; Yang, Yili/0000-0002-1791-3899													0094-8276	1944-8007				APR 16	2023	50	7							e2022GL102327	10.1029/2022GL102327	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022GL102327													WOS:000973421700001
J	Kayastha, MB; Ye, XY; Huang, CF; Xue, PF				Kayastha, Miraj B.; Ye, Xinyu; Huang, Chenfu; Xue, Pengfei			Future rise of the Great Lakes water levels under climate change	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The Great Lakes of North America are the largest unfrozen surface freshwater system in the world and many ecosystems, industries, and coastal processes are sensitive to the changes in their water levels. The water levels of the Great Lakes are primarily governed by the net basin supplies (NBS) of each lake which are the sum of over -lake precipitation and basin runoff minus lake evaporation. Recent studies projected the future NBS of the Great Lakes by dynamically downscaling General Circulation Models (GCMs) using Regional Climate Models (RCMs). However, their RCMs had been coupled to one-dimensional (1D) lake column models which lack the ability to accurately simulate the Great Lakes' hydrodynamics and thermal structure. In this study, an ensemble of three dynamical downscalings based on the Great Lakes-Atmosphere Regional Model (GLARM) is used to project the future NBS and water level of the Great Lakes. GLARM is a three-dimensional (3D) regional climate modeling system for the Great Lakes region that two-way couples an RCM to a 3D hydrodynamic lake and ice model, making this the first study to use such an advanced model for water level projection of the Great Lakes. For the present-day climate, over-lake precipitation and lake evaporation simulated by GLARM, along with the basin runoff simulated by the GLARM-driven Large Basin Runoff Model (LBRM), track the mean seasonal cycle of the NBS components remarkably well. In particular, compared to previous studies, the most significant improve-ments are made in estimating the lake evaporation. For future hydroclimate, the ensemble average projects an increase in annual NBS and average annual water level for each lake. The projected NBS increase is mostly due to an increase in over-lake precipitation and basin runoff combined with a relatively smaller increase in lake evaporation. According to the ensemble average, by 2040-2049, the average annual water levels of Lake Su-perior, Michigan-Huron, and Erie are projected to increase by +0.19, +0.44, and +0.28 m, respectively, relative to 2010-2019. The individual downscaling cases highlight the uncertainty in climate projection, showing both increases and decreases in annual NBS and water level projection. The projected changes in the average annual water levels by 2040-2049 relative to 2010-2019 range from-0.01 to +0.32 m in Lake Superior,-0.13 to +0.80 m in Lake Michigan-Huron and-0.09 to +0.54 m in Lake Erie.					; Huang, Chenfu/G-9662-2014; Xue, Pengfei/P-4016-2014; Xue, Pengfei/P-4016-2014	Kayastha, Miraj B/0000-0002-9956-8362; Xue, Pengfei/0000-0002-5702-421X; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				SEP	2022	612		B						128205	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128205	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128205		JUL 2022											WOS:000866230900001

A quarter of a century ago, the state of this understanding was described by the verbal plankton ecology group (PEG) model. It emphasized the role of physical factors, grazing and nutrient limitation for phytoplankton, and the role of food limitation and fish predation for zooplankton. Although originally targeted at lake ecosystems, it was also adopted by marine plankton ecologists. Since then, a suite of ecological interactions previously underestimated in importance have become research foci: overwintering of key organisms, the microbial food web, parasitism, and food quality as a limiting factor and an extended role of higher order predators. A review of the impact of these novel interactions on plankton seasonal succession reveals limited effects on gross seasonal biomass patterns, but strong effects on species replacements.

J	Hollander, M; Bradley, RA				Hollander, M; Bradley, RA			A conversation with Ralph A.!Bradley	STATISTICAL SCIENCE												Ralph A. Bradley was born in Smith Falls, Ontario, Canada on November 28, 1923, but grew up in the village of Wellington on the shores of Lake Ontario. He graduated from Queen's University in 1944 with an honors degree in mathematics and physics, was in the Canadian Army, 1944-1945 and returned to Queen's to complete an M.A. degree in 1946. In 1946 he entered the then new doctoral program in theoretical statistics at the University of North Carolina and received the Ph.D. degree in June, 1949. His first academic position was at McGill University, 1949-1950, followed by nine years at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, 1950-1958. Bradley moved to Florida State University in 1959 to found a Department of Statistics there, heading the department until 1978, with the exception of ten months in Egypt in 1966 as a consultant to the Ford Foundation and the Institute of Statistical Studies and Research of the University of Cairo. He moved to the University of Georgia as Research Professor of Statistics in 1982. Although he retired in 1992, he continues to participate in activities in statistics there. He has been named Professor Emeritus at both Florida State and Georgia Universities. Bradley has played a leadership role in the professional societies. He was Editor of Biometrics, 1957-1962, and Vice-President and President of the Eastern North American Region (1963-1965). He served as Vice-President (1975-1978) and President (1981) of the American Statistical Association (ASA). He headed (with Margaret E. Martin) the Coordinating Committee of the ASA Building and Development Fund (1982-1988) and was a member of the Future Goals Committee (1980). He has also served on various committees of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, been active in the International Statistical Institute, the Gordon Research Conferences, the Southern Regional Committee on Statistics, and the National Institute of Statistical Sciences. He has served on the editorial boards of Biometrics, the Journal of Statistical Computing and Simulation, and Communications in Statistics-Theory and Methods and acted as an editorial advisor on the Wiley Series on Probability and Statistics (1954-1998). Bradley has been active in research throughout his career. He has over 110 research papers in such areas as design of experiments, non-parametric statistics, methodology for sensory evaluations, sequential analysis, multivariate analysis, probability theory and computing techniques. Most of his papers stemmed from his statistical consulting on applied problems, or from the need to develop new theory to solve such problems. Bradley's consulting with General Foods on statistical methods in product evaluation was particularly influential in stimulating his own research and the research of others. Bradley has also been extensively involved with statistical consulting on organizational matters, His work in Egypt led to requests for his participation in regional conferences and reviews of statistical programs in the Middle East. He has been instrumental in establishing statistical consulting units and in obtaining funds to support research and graduate students in the departments where he had leadership roles. Ralph Bradley has received numerous recognitions for his contributions to the discipline. He was elected Fellow of the American Statistical Association (1957), the Institute of Mathematical Statistics and the American Association fbr the Advancement of Science (1963) and became an elected member of the International Statistical Institute (1970). He has received Founders Awards from the ASA and the Southern Regional Committee on Statistics, (1992) and the (1994) Paul Minton Service Award of the latter committee. In 1970 Bradley was named the R. O. Lawton Distinguished Professor, Florida State University, an award made to only one faculty member per year and the University's highest faculty honor.																			0883-4237	2168-8745				FEB	2001	16	1					75	100		10.1214/ss/998929483	http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/ss/998929483													WOS:000169674200006

However, the role of inland waterbodies in the dynamics of atmospheric N2O is poorly understood. We investigated N2O fluxes and their controlling factors in Lake Taihu, a large and shallow (2400 km(2), 1.9 m depth) eutrophic lake in eastern China. Long-term measurements (2011-2016) revealed spatial and temporal variations in the lake surface N2O fluxes. The mean N2O flux from the lake was 3.5 +/- 1.8 (mean +/- SD) mu mol m(-2) d(-1), with an annual N2O budget of 134.4 +/- 69.8 Mg (10(6) g) yr(-1). The highest N2O fluxes occurred in the eutrophic zone with significant anthropogenic N inputs, and the lowest fluxes occurred in the noneutrophic zone with no external N inflow. A seasonal pattern in N2O fluxes was observed only in the noneutrophic zone and was strongly correlated with water temperature. No seasonality in the N2O fluxes was observed in the eutrophic zone with high N concentrations in the water, indicating that N concentrations play a dominant role in regulating N2O fluxes compared to water temperature. The average N2O emission factor in Lake Taihu was 0.18%, with temporal and spatial variations negatively associated with N concentration but positively associated with the mass ratio of dissolved organic carbon to dissolved inorganic nitrogen. Our results suggest that anthropogenic activities strongly affect N2O fluxes in freshwater lakes.

The health of aquatic ecosystems is dependent on right proportions and required succession of major nutrients in the water and sediment. Surface water pollution by agrochemicals has become a growing threat to the human society and natural ecosystems in the recent decades. Lake Tana is the largest fresh water body in Ethiopia, located at an altitude of 1786 m above sea level. The lake has an average depth of 9 m and maximum depth of 14 m with surface area of 3150 km(2). The lake is an economically important shallow lake in the country and is threatened by anthropogenic and climatic factors. Excess agrochemicals input from agricultural activities and industrial effluent around Lake Tana watershed can pose a serious threat on the lake ecosystem by expansion of water hyacinth. The study was made to investigate the spatio-temporal variations of selected water quality parameters and trophic status of Lake Tana for sustainable management options for sustainable use of the lake. Different environmental samples such as water and sediment were collected from fourteen representative sampling sites of the lake for the measurement of physicochemical parameters and nutrients in both dry and wet seasonal basis. The physicochemical parameters were measured in-situ with portable multimeter and nutrients and chlorophyll a were determined by following the standard procedures outlined in the American Public Health Association (APHA) using UV/Visible spectrophotometer. The trophic status of the lake was determined using trophic state variable and Carlson model. The lake water quality level was also evaluated using comprehensive evaluation index model. There were spatio-temporal variations in the physico-chemical parameters and nutrients in the lake ecosystem during the study period. Higher concentrations of nutrients, electrical conductivity (EC) and total dissolved solid (TDS) were recorded in sampling sites of effluents of the some resort and the major feeding rivers in all seasons. The values of the comprehensive pollution index ranged from 0.68 to 1.01 and 0.91 to 1.69 during dry and wet seasons respectively. According to the values of comprehensive pollution index, the lake is moderately and slightly polluted in dry and wet seasons, respectively. The values for SAP, and TP distributions were higher in the wet season in most of the sampling sites. Carlson trophic state model showed the average values of Carlson Trophic State Index (CTSI) of Lake Tana were found to be 69.77 and clearly indicated Lake Tana TSI value lies well above the minimum value for eutrophic condition. In order to stop further deterioration of lake water quality and to eventually restore the beneficial uses of the lake, management of agrochemicals in the lake watershed should be given urgent priority. It is mandatory to prepare guidelines for the trophic status of the Ethiopian freshwater bodies in the country by malting bottom-up-down discussion.

Seasonal and spatial variations of greenhouse gas (CO2, CH4 and N2O) emissions from urban ponds in Brussels	WATER RESEARCH												Freshwaters have been recognized as important sources of greenhouse gases (GHG) to the atmosphere. However, urban ponds have received little attention even though their number is increasing due to expanding urbanisation globally. Ponds are frequently associated to urban green spaces that provide several ecosystemic services such as cooling local climate, regulating the water cycle, and acting as small carbon sinks This study aims to identify and understand the processes producing GHGs (CO2, CH4, and N2O) in the urban ponds of the temperate European city of Brussels in Belgium. 22 relatively small ponds (0.1-4.6 ha) surrounded by contrasted landscape (strictly urban, bordered by cropland or by forest), were sampled during four seasons in 2021-2022. The mean +/- standard deviation was 3,667 +/- 2,904 ppm for the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2), 2,833 +/- 4,178 nmol L-1 for CH4, and 273 +/- 662% for N2O saturation level (%N2O). Relationships of GHGs with oxygen and water temperature suggest that biological processes controlled pCO2, CH4 concentration and%N2O. However, pCO2 was also controlled by external inputs as indicated by the higher values of pCO2 in the smaller ponds, more subject to external inputs than larger ones. The opposite was observed for CH4 concentration that was higher in larger ponds, closer to the forest in the city periphery, and with higher macrophyte cover. N2O concentrations, as well as dissolved inorganic nitrogen, were higher closer to the city center, where atmospheric nitrogen deposition was potentially higher. The total GHG emissions from the Brussels ponds were estimated to 1kT CO2-eq per year and were equivalent to the carbon sink of urban green spaces.

Magnetic parameters and heavy metal concentrations of sediments from Chaohu Lake (China) were analyzed. The magnetic measurements, high- and low-temperature curves, and hysteresis loops showed the primary magnetic minerals were ferrimagnetic minerals in sediments. For most metals, their concentrations were highest during the wet season and lowest during the medium-water period. Cd, Hg, and Zn were moderately enriched and Cd and Hg posed a considerable ecological risk. A redundancy analysis indicated a relationship between physicochemical indexes and magnetic parameters and heavy metal concentrations. An artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) were used to construct six models to predict the heavy metal concentrations and ecological risk index. The inclusion of both the physicochemical indexes and magnetic parameters as input factors in the models were significantly ameliorated the simulation accuracy for the majority of heavy metals. The training and test R, for Be, Fe, Pb, Zn, As, Cu, and Cr were > 0.8. The SVM showed better performance and hence it has potential for the efficient and economical long-term tracking and monitoring of heavy metal pollution in lake sediments.

With rapid economic development, China has become the main market of manufacturing and consuming fluorinated products. While studies concerning PFAAs on dimension of urban water system are scarce. To elucidate the distribution patterns of PFAAs using multi-matrices, the effects of spatial-temporal factors on the partition behaviors of PFAAs were investigated in different riverine environments in the downtown area of Nanjing, East China. Predominated by perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), sum PFAAs ( PFAAs) in the water phase were with concentrations of 0.8(similar to)274.6 ng/L, characteristically higher in the dry season and lower in the wet season. The composition profiles in sediments ( PFAAs 0.8-11.4 ng/g dry weight) differed from that in water, being with a larger proportion of longer-chain PFAAs. The main sources of PFAAs in water were identified as industrial discharge, uncontrolled sewage discharge or WWTP effluents, surface runoff and nonpoint sources. The discharge fluxes of EPFAAs from Nanjing City can reach at 916.5 g/d for the Qinhuai River and 134.1 g/d for WWTPs along the Yangtze River. Fish have been shown to accumulate PFAAs in various tissues, with bioaccumulation positively correlated with perfluoroalkyl chain length. The hazard indexes associated with consumption of river fish were estimated low for Nanjing local population.					; Dong, Huike/AAU-1265-2021; jiang, runre/ISV-0687-2023; Zhang, Peng/H-9461-2018	Nkoom, Matthew/0000-0002-9247-1621; Jiang, Runren/0000-0002-6003-2851; 													0304-3894	1873-3336				JAN 5	2020	381								120911	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.120911	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.120911								31357077					WOS:000504778400003

Many recent studies have used radiocarbon (C-14) to quantify the release of this "old" SOC as CO2 or CH4 to the atmosphere or as dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC) to surface waters. We compiled similar to 1,900 C-14 measurements from 51 sites in the northern permafrost region to assess the vulnerability of thawing SOC in tundra, forest, peatland, lake, and river ecosystems. We found that growing season soil C-14-CO2 emissions generally had a modern (post-1950s) signature, but that well-drained, oxic soils had increased CO(2)emissions derived from older sources following recent thaw. The age of CO2 and CH4 emitted from lakes depended primarily on the age and quantity of SOC in sediments and on the mode of emission, and indicated substantial losses of previously frozen SOC from actively expanding thermokarst lakes. Increased fluvial export of aged DOC and POC occurred from sites where permafrost thaw caused soil thermal erosion. There was limited evidence supporting release of previously frozen SOC as CO2, CH4, and DOC from thawing peatlands with anoxic soils. This synthesis thus suggests widespread but not universal release of permafrost SOC following thaw. We show that different definitions of "old" sources among studies hamper the comparison of vulnerability of permafrost SOC across ecosystems and disturbances. We also highlight opportunities for future C-14 studies in the permafrost region.

A detailed investigation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in the multiphase system of DSL is very important for understanding their occurrence, sources, partition, and health risks. Total 11 sampling sites were selected including 3 inflowing rivers, 6 lake body sites, and 2 outflowing rivers. Total OCPs (Sigma(20)OCPs) showed the highest concentration in water dissolved phase with a range of 47.8-143 ng/L. Total PAHs (Sigma(16) PAHs) were the dominant compounds for suspended particle matter (SPM) and sediment phase, with a range of 2805-4130 and 206-4262 ng/g, respectively. The nonparametric test revealed the significantly higher concentrations of Sigma(16)PAHs in sediment, Sigma(18)PCBs in SPM, and Sigma(20)OCPs in dissolved water from inflowing rivers than lake body (p < 0.05), indicating the strong effect of riverine pollution input. The different seasonal distribution between Sigma(16)PAHs with Sigma(18)PCBs/Sigma(20)OCPs in SPM phase of lake body was closely attributed to their source disparities and the changes of rainfall and hydrodynamic conditions. Homologue compositions and isomer ratios analysis showed in DSL watershed PAHs were mainly derived from pyrogenic sources, PCBs from the leakage of capacitor equipment, sewage drainage of industries, and exfoliation of ship paints, and DDT from historical and recent application. The bioaccumulations of POPs in six fish species (n = 20) of DSL had high detection frequencies and a descending concentration order: Sigma(16)PAHs (353 +/- 106 ng/g) > Sigma(20)OCPs (67.4 +/- 27.0 ng/g) > Sigma(18)PCBs (32.0 +/- 13.7 ng/g), with obvious species-specific characteristics. The partitioning behaviors of PAH congeners in the water-SPM-sediment-fish system of DSL were greatly influenced by logK(ow) values. However, the feeding habits (e.g., sediment-feeding behavior) of fish species played a predominant role in the bioaccumulation of PCB and OCP congeners compared to two-phase partition. Health risk assessments of POPs in dissolved water and fish samples revealed that only Sigma(16) PAHs in dissolved phase have potential carcinogenic risk.

Due to the characteristics of process-based models and difficulties in modelling complex nonlinear processes, traditional models have difficulties disentangling the driving factors of HABs. In this study, we used data-driven methods (i.e., correlation analysis and machine-learning models) to identify the most important drivers of HABs in the Xiangxi River, a tributary of the Three Gorges Reservoir, China (2017-2018), for the dry season (from October to mid-April) and wet season (from April to September). We utilized the maximal information coefficient (MIC) combined with a time lag strategy and prior knowledge to quantitatively identify the driving variables of HABs. An extra trees regression (ETR) model was developed to assess the relative importance of causal variables driving algal blooms for the different periods. The results showed that water temperature was the most important driver for the duration of the study, followed by total nitrogen. Nitrogen had a stronger effect on algal blooms than phosphorus during both the wet and dry seasons. HABs were mainly affected by ammonia nitrogen in the wet season and by other forms of nitrogen in the dry season. In contrast, rather than the water temperature and nutrients, the operation of the Three Gorges Dam (difference between inflow and outflow discharge rate) was the most significant factor for algal blooms during the dry season, but its influence sharply declined during the wet season. This study showed that the key drivers of HABs can differ between seasons and suggests that HAB management should take seasonality into account.					; He, Chao/IVH-1207-2023; Trolle, Dennis/B-5465-2008; Hu, Ming-Ming/AAX-4704-2020	Su, Yuming/0000-0002-1806-2571; Trolle, Dennis/0000-0001-7568-2411; 													0269-7491	1873-6424				MAR 15	2022	297								118759	10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118759	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118759		JAN 2022						34971739					WOS:000760152800008

F.			Annual CO2 and CH4 fluxes in coastal earthen ponds with Litopenaeus vannamei in southeastern China	AQUACULTURE												Small-scale aquaculture operation is being increasing practised around the world, particularly in the developing countries, but the greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics and fluxes from small aquaculture ponds are still poorly assessed. In this study, the dissolved concentrations and fluxes of CO2 and CH4 were determined in three coastal earthen shrimp ponds over one whole year, covering both the farming and non-farming periods, in the Min River Estuary, southeastern China. Both ebullitive and diffusive CH4 fluxes were measured, which were rarely done in previous studies. The average concentrations of dissolved CO2 and CH4 in water column in the farming period varied between 18.1 +/- 0.1 and 79.6 +/- 1.1 mu mol L-1, and 1.3 +/- 0.1 and 55.9 +/- 3.2 mu mol L-1, respectively. When averaged across the whole year, the mean CO2 and CH4 fluxes from the ponds were - 18.4 +/- 7.4 and 22.6 +/- 6.9 mg m- 2 h-1, respectively, suggesting that the shrimp ponds acted as a CO2 sink and a CH4 source. Based on the sustained-flux global warming potential (SGWP) and sustained-flux global cooling potential (SGCP) models, the annual warming potential was estimated to be 7.1 x 103 g CO2-eq m- 2 yr- 1, with approximately 90% of this arising from the farming period. Ebullition was the dominant emission pathway for CH4, accounting for over 90% of the total CH4 emission during the farming period. This full-year study improves our understanding of carbon cycling in coastal aquaculture ponds and provides a scientific basis for updating the GHG inventories.

Satellite image-based investigation of the seasonal variations in the hydrological connectivity of a large floodplain (Poyang Lake, China)	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Hydrological processes of floodplains in large river-lake systems are subjected to strong flood pulses from catchment flows and lake inundations. Hydrological connectivity (HC) is one of the important characteristics of floodplains that can be used to provide evidence of mass and energy transport that influences the health of ecosystems and the biological productivity of floodplain water bodies. This study used geostatistical methods in combination with remote sensing data (2000-2015) to investigate the hydrological connectivity in a complex river-lake floodplain (Nanji Wetland National Natural Reserve) of the Poyang Lake floodplain, which is naturally connected to the middle Yangtze River. The geomorphic characteristics of the study area were characterized by the connection of surface water bodies including rivers, wetlands, sub-lakes and main lake. Results of this research indicated the apparent seasonal shifts of the dominant hydrological factors that affect the spatial-temporal changes of HC. In particular, we find that the main lake stage plays a dominant role in determining the hydrological connectivity during the lake's flooding and receding periods. We also find the existence of a threshold that causes an abrupt change of HC, i.e., if the main lake stage is below this threshold, the whole system becomes weakly hydrologically-connected. This threshold is related to the local topography, but has ecological implications for the entire floodplain system. The outcomes of this research provide an improved understanding of the hydrological behaviour of the catchment-floodplain-lake system. Considering the encountering of consistent drought of the lakes in the middle Yangtze River, this work may help clarify the intensity of the drought impacts on the ecologically important floodplains, and also assist in optimizing the interactions between the lake and the Yangtze River.

J	Zhao, YY; Zheng, BH; Jia, HF; Chen, ZX				Zhao, Yunyun; Zheng, Binghui; Jia, Haifeng; Chen, Zhengxia			Determination sources of nitrates into the Three Gorges Reservoir using nitrogen and oxygen isotopes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Identification of nitrate sources and its transformations are important for the management of large lakes and reservoirs. The Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in China is one of the largest reservoirs around the world. In this study, stable isotopes of nitrogen (delta N-15-NO3-) and oxygen (delta O-18-NO3-) of nitrate in water were used to gain insights into nitrate sources and transformations in the tail area of the TGR. Bayesian mixing model has been conducted to estimate the proportional contribute of nitrate sources. The mixing modelling results indicated that NH4+ fertilizer (range 7-54%) and soil organic nitrogen (range 2-45%) were the dominant NO3--N sources in the tail area of the TGR during the three season study period. Nitrification contributed a part of NO3--N in the riverwater during the dry season. The nitrate from soil solution in the riparian zone with denitrified NO3- might be another major reason for the enrichment of delta N-15-NO3 - and delta O-18-NO3- during the normal season. Reducing the use of chemical nitrogen fertilizers, especially NH4+ fertilizers, and protecting soil from erosion may be effective measures to improve water quality in the TGR. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Data from 30 surveyed sampling sites over the lake water in June 2016 and May 2017 demonstrated the appropriateness of S2A green-red band ratio (band 3 versus band 4) for estimating Chla. This was shown through a strong correlation of corresponded field measured reflectance ratio with Chla by an exponential curve (r(2) = 0.68; the mean standard error of the estimates corresponding to 5% of the mean value of in situ Chla). The small error between in situ Chla, and estimated Chla from S2A acquired concurrently, confirmed the S2A green-red band ratio as the most suitable option for monitoring Chla in Lake Ba Be water. Resultant Chla distribution maps over time described a partially-seasonal pattern and also displayed the spatial dynamic of Chla in the lake. This allows a better understanding of the lake's limnological processes to be developed and provides an insight into the factors that affect lake water quality. The results also confirmed the potential of S2A to be used as a free tool for lake monitoring and research due to high spatial resolution data (10 m pixel size).					; Katsuaki, Koike/AAF-6438-2020	Nguyen Thien Phuong, Thao/0000-0003-4833-5064; Mai, Trong Nhuan/0009-0000-3098-6761; Nguyen, Ha/0000-0002-5010-5615; Koike, Katsuaki/0000-0003-2195-1369														2220-9964				SEP	2017	6	9							290	10.3390/ijgi6090290	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi6090290													WOS:000416386100030

This research compared image content and text from Flickr posted by tourists visiting the alpine area around the highest mountain in Australia, in Kosciuszko National Park, to assess seasonal preferences for tourism (i.e., facilities and activities) and nature (i.e., landscapes, flora and fauna). In warmer months when access is easier and the alpine area receives more than 100,000 visitors, tourists' images focused on landscapes (54%) or biodiversity (50%), with fewer images including tourists (23%), mainly hiking (18%). Images were often labelled by the name of the mountain and Park. In contrast, during colder months when access is limited and approximately 400 people visit the alpine area, images still included landscapes (50%) though were also more likely to depict recreation activities (37%), including skiing (8.8%), nearly always showing snow (82%) and using tags such as 'snow', 'ski' and 'Snowy Mountains'. Images of plants tended to show flowering herbs (7.3%) when warm or snowgums when cold (11.4%), while lakes (6.8%), creeks (4.2%) and animals (2.4%) were uncommon in images. Seasonal differences in visitor views and preferences of an area have implications for tourism, conservation and management including better understanding what may attract visitors. Challenges with coding images and text and the benefits and limitations of this novel data source in comparison to onsite surveys are considered.					; Rossi, Sebastian/OGM-9415-2025	Pickering, Catherine/0000-0002-3731-5407; Walden-Schreiner, Chelsey/0000-0002-9342-2880; Rossi, Sebastian/0000-0002-2303-2094													2213-0780	2213-0799				MAR	2020	29								100252	10.1016/j.jort.2019.100252	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jort.2019.100252													WOS:000519246500023

Seven factors are used as the input for the LSTM model and eight years of daily data (from 2003 to 2012) are used to train the model. Then, the model is applied to the test dataset (from 2011 to 2013) for forecasting and is evaluated using the root mean squared error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R-2). The test shows the LSTM model has better accuracy compared to the support vector machine (SVM) model. Furthermore, the model is adjusted to simulate the situation where the TGD does not exist to explore the dam's impact. The experiment shows that the water level of Dongting Lake drops conspicuously every year from September to November during the TGD impounding period, and the water level increases mildly during dry seasons due to TGD replenishment. Additionally, the impact of the TGD results in a water level decline in Dongting Lake during flood peaks and a subsequent lagged rise. This research provides a tool for flood forecasting and offers a reference for TGD water regulation.

GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS												For most people, the direct and personally observable signals of climate change should be difficult to detect amid the variability of everyday weather. Yet, previous research has shown that some people believe they have personally experienced global warming. Through four related studies, our paper sheds light on what signals of global warming some people believe they are detecting, why, and whether or not it matters. These studies were conducted using population survey and climatic data from a single county in Michigan. Study 1 found that 27% of the county's adult residents felt that they had personally experienced global warming. Study 2 - based on content analysis of people's open-ended responses - found that the most frequently described personal experiences of global warming were changes in seasons (36%), weather (25%), lake levels (24%), animals and plants (20%), and snowfall (19%). Study 3 - based on NOAA climatic data - found that most, but not all, of these detected signals are borne out in the climatic record. Study 4 - using the survey data - found that personal experience of global warming matters in that it predicts perceptions of local risk of global warming, controlling for demographics, political affiliation, and cultural beliefs about national policy outcomes. We conclude that perceived personal experience of global warming appears to heighten people's perception of the risks, likely through some combination of direct experience, vicarious experience (e.g., news media stories), and social construction.

This letter monitors waterbody dynamics in a high temporal resolution from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 images by using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Water index, automatic threshold and postprocessing of noise elimination are used to extract the water pixels from the background. Taking a part of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River () as a case study, the surface water dynamics are estimated by 47 dates from February 2017 to November 2019. The popular JRC Global Surface Water database includes 8 qualified monthly maps for the study area in 2017 and 2018, while our results display 32 maps covering 18 months. The surface water dynamic maps obtain an overall accuracy of 92.5% (using random sample points) and 82.0% (using manual-drawing thematic map). Also, water occurrence is calculated based on the water dynamics to indicate the permanent, seasonal and flooding areas. The high temporal dynamics of surface water are meaningful for the analysis of ephemeral lake and inundation extent.

Lawrence; An, Zhisheng			Holocene moisture changes in western China, Central Asia, inferred from stalagmites	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Central Asia lies at the convergence between the Mediterranean and Asian monsoon climates, and there is a complex interaction between the westerlies with the monsoon to form the climate of that region and its variability. The region is highly vulnerable to changes in rainfall, highlighting the need to understand the underlying controls. We present a stalagmite-based delta O-18 record from Kesang Cave in western China, using MC-ICP-MS U-series dating and stable isotope analysis. Stalagmite calcite delta O-18 largely documents changes in the delta O-18 of precipitation. delta O-18 in stalagmites was low during the early and middle Holocene (10.0-3.0 ka BP), and shifted to higher values between 3.0 and 2.0 ka BP. After 2.01 ka BP, delta O-18 fluctuates with distinct centennial-scale variations. Drawing from results of state-of-the-art atmospheric general circulation model simulations for the preindustrial period and 9 ka BP, we propose that changes in moisture source regions and the wetter climate both contributed to the isotopic depletion of precipitation during the early and middle Holocene. Multiple records from surrounding regions indicate a generally wetter climate during the early and mid- Holocene, supporting our interpretation on the speleothem delta O-18. Changes in precipitation seasonality do not appear to be a viable explanation for the observed changes, nor increased penetration of monsoonal moisture to the study site. We speculate that the climatic regime shifted around 3.0-2.0 ka BP towards a drier climate, resulting in temperature having dominant control on precipitation delta O-18. The demise of three settlements around 500AD at the margin of Tarim Basin coincided with a period of decreased precipitation and increased temperature that likely affected local water resources, underscoring the potential impact of climate on human habitation in this region.

Numerous reports have investigated the influence of domestic sewage discharge, medical wastewater and aquaculture wastewater on rivers and lakes, while the dynamics of ARGs in seawater and the relationships between ARGs, bacterial community structure and environmental factors have been less thoroughly described. In this study, the abundance, distribution and source of ARGs, as well as the relationships between ARGs, bacterial community changes and environmental factors in the seawater environment and sediment of Dapeng Cove, were investigated. Real-time quantitative PCR and Illumina Miseq sequencing technology were applied to determine the effects of the production cycle of cage culture, tourism and seasonality on ARGs. Chloramphenicol resistance genes (floR, cmlA) and sulfonamide resistance genes (sul1) were the dominant resistance genes in water and sediment. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that the abundance of all ARGs and the integrase I gene intI1 was positively correlated with chemical oxygen demand and suspended solids. Class 1 integrons might facilitate the dissemination of ARGs, and intI1 was detected in all samples at high concentrations. In aqueous environments, Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla, among which Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were positively correlated with the concentration of target ARGs. In the sediment, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria and Planctomycetes were the dominant phyla, among which Bacteroidetes and Planctomycetes were positively correlated with most of the target ARGs and had a significant influence on changes in the abundance of ARGs. The domestic sewage was the main source of ARGs in the seawater. Our results showed that bacterial community structure and environmental factors affected the distributional dynamics of ARGs. Anthropogenic activities played significant roles in promoting ARGs abundance in the seawater environments. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In lake sediments, mixed lacustrine vs. soil sources of brGDGTs pose a challenge to quantitative application of this paleothermometer, and this effect has not yet been well-constrained. In this work, we analyzed concentrations and distributions of brGDGTs along with two other types of typical lipid biomarkers (isoGDGTs and long-chain n-alkanes) in modern sediments and catchment soils from 26 park lakes across a large climatic gradient in China. BrGDGTs in these lakes may largely represent the lacustrine signal due to the relatively small catchment area and high eutrophic condition. This is confirmed by the combined use of crenarchaeol, its isomer crenarchaeol', and C33 n-alkane as tracers of soil input for brGDGTs. This novel method quantifies the upper limit of soil brGDGT contribution to be less than 10% for most investigated lakes, with an average value of 7% +/- 10%. Subsequently, the brGDGT signal of the assumed pure lacustrine origin was constrained by the subtle difference between the original sedimentary brGDGTs and those corrected by the maximum possible soil brGDGT input for those park lakes. A compilation of global freshwater lakes further shows that the correlation between the methylation index of brGDGTs (MBT or MBT'5ME) of their sediments and temperature matches that for the assumed pure lacustrine signals. Hence, soil contribution might be generally minor and may not significantly impact the quantitative application of the brGDGT paleothermometer for worldwide lakes. This study reinforces a foundation for this novel lacustrine paleothermometer to be applied in paleoclimate reconstructions, although factors affecting lacustrine brGDGT distributions within lakes still need to be better constrained.

J	Han, HH; Gao, R; Cui, YL; Gu, SX				Han, Huanhao; Gao, Rong; Cui, Yuanlai; Gu, Shixiang			Transport and transformation of water and nitrogen under different irrigation modes and urea application regimes in paddy fields	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Nitrogen pollution from paddy fields is a main contributor to global non-point source (NPS) pollution and greatly increases the risks of surface water eutrophication and groundwater contamination. This study assesses the comprehensive transport and transformation of water and nitrogen (TTWN) for a 4-year irrigation and urea application in the paddy field using 6 water balance components and 12 nitrogen inputs and outputs. The results show that alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation reduces water and nitrogen for irrigation, drainage, and leaching, but has a minor effect on rice evapotranspiration (ETc). Urea application and mineralization are the most important nitrogen inputs to the paddy field, accounting for 58.7-68.2% and 23.7-35.0% of nitrogen input, respectively. Rice plant uptake, ammonia volatilization (AV), and nitrification-denitrification account for 68.0-75.0%, 11.9-17.1%, and 5.1-9.3% of nitrogen output, respectively. Nitrogen leaching (3.5-11.5 kg.ha(-1)) is also large while the observed depth of leaching needs to be further investigated. Meanwhile, nitrogen drainage (0.72-1.11 kg.ha(-1)) is not as large as conventionally accepted. AWD affects the nitrogen accumulation and release of duckweed, which is one of the potential reasons for the increase in rice yields. In the course of four continuous rice seasons, the soil nitrogen content (SNC) of the 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm soil layers continued to decrease and increase, respectively, and the overall nitrogen content did not change significantly. Irrigation modes and fertilization splits may promote or inhibit AV, and it depended on the time when urea was applied. In addition, AWD and three fertilization splits significantly promote nitrification-denitrification and nitrogen uptake by rice. This study presents a theoretical basis for NPS pollution reduction and provides an important framework for establishing an accurate model of TTWN for paddy fields.						han, huanhao/0000-0003-2199-6823													0378-3774	1873-2283				SEP 1	2021	255								107024	10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107024		JUN 2021											WOS:000681281300003

However, little is known about the diversity and the seasonal dynamics of the bacterial community composition (BCC) involved in the degradation of MCs in nature. To explore these BCC shifts, high-throughput sequencing was used to analyse the 16S rRNA, mcyE and mlrA genes during a year in a freshwater reservoir with a toxic cyanobacterial bloom episode. The analysis of the mcyE and mlrA genes from water samples revealed the coexistence of different MC producing and MC-degrading genotypes, respectively. The patchy temporal distribution of the mlrA genotypes (from the families Sphingomonadaceae and Xanthomonadaceae) suggests their dissimilar response to environmental conditions and the influence of other factors besides the MCs that may control their presence and relative abundance. During the maximum toxic cyanobacterial biomass and cell lysis, other bacterial taxa that lack mlr genes increased their relative abundance. Among these bacteria, those with a recognized role in the degradation of xenobiotic and other complex organic compounds (e.g., orders Myxococcales, Ellin6067, Spirobacillales and Cytophagales) were the most representative and suggest their possible involvement in the removal of MCs in the environment.

To achieve a more comprehensive understanding the characteristics of DOM in the Changjiang (Yangtze) River basin, water samples from four natural lakes (Xiandao, Baoan, Daye, and Qingshan) in southeastern Hubei Province in China with different eutrophication levels were collected and analyzed. The optical characteristics were analyzed using ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry and excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis. The results show that: (1) two humic-like components (C1 and C2) and two protein-like substances (C3 and C4) of DOM were identified in all waterbodies; (2) C3 originated primarily from the degradation of microalgae and contributed substantially to humic-like components during transformation. C4 was widely present in the Changjiang River basin and its formation was related to microbial activity, rather than algal blooms or seasons. Influenced by the water mixing, the protein-like components were more likely to be transformed by microorganism, whereas humic-like components were more easily to be photobleached; (3) the concentration of DOM and the fluorescence intensity of humic-like components gradually increased with rising lake eutrophication levels. With respect to protein-like components, only C3 showed changes along the eutrophication gradients; (4) DOM showed a high affinity with permanganate index (CODMn) and chlorophyll a (chl a) while the relationship was variable with phosphorus. This study helps us systematically understand the DOM characteristics, microbial activities, and pollutant transformation in the Changjiang River basin and provides reference to the ecological restoration of aquatic environments.

Permafrost collapse alters soil carbon stocks, respiration, CH4, and N2O in upland tundra	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Release of greenhouse gases from thawing permafrost is potentially the largest terrestrial feedback to climate change and one of the most likely to occur; however, estimates of its strength vary by a factor of thirty. Some of this uncertainty stems from abrupt thaw processes known as thermokarst (permafrost collapse due to ground ice melt), which alter controls on carbon and nitrogen cycling and expose organic matter from meters below the surface. Thermokarst may affect 20-50% of tundra uplands by the end of the century; however, little is known about the effect of different thermokarst morphologies on carbon and nitrogen release. We measured soil organic matter displacement, ecosystem respiration, and soil gas concentrations at 26 upland thermokarst features on the North Slope of Alaska. Features included the three most common upland thermokarst morphologies: active-layer detachment slides, thermo-erosion gullies, and retrogressive thaw slumps. We found that thermokarst morphology interacted with landscape parameters to determine both the initial displacement of organic matter and subsequent carbon and nitrogen cycling. The large proportion of ecosystem carbon exported off-site by slumps and slides resulted in decreased ecosystem respiration postfailure, while gullies removed a smaller portion of ecosystem carbon but strongly increased respiration and N2O concentration. Elevated N2O in gully soils persisted through most of the growing season, indicating sustained nitrification and denitrification in disturbed soils, representing a potential noncarbon permafrost climate feedback. While upland thermokarst formation did not substantially alter redox conditions within features, it redistributed organic matter into both oxic and anoxic environments. Across morphologies, residual organic matter cover, and predisturbance respiration explained 83% of the variation in respiration response. Consistent differences between upland thermokarst types may contribute to the incorporation of this nonlinear process into projections of carbon and nitrogen release from degrading permafrost.

It is of paramount importance to better understand the fate, transformation, and biogeochemical cycling processes of different P species across the river-lake interface. We report here results on chemical speciation of P in the seasonally hypoxic Fox River-Green Bay system and variations in sources and partitioning of P species along the aquatic continuum. During midsummer when productivity is generally high, phosphate and dissolved organic P (DOP) were the major species in river water while particulate-organic-P predominated in open bay waters, showing a dynamic change in the chemical speciation of P along the river-bay transect with active transformations between inorganic and organic P and between colloidal and particulate phases. Colloidal organic P (COP, >1 kDa) comprised 33-65% of the bulk DOP, while colloidal inorganic P was generally insignificant and undetectable especially in open bay water. Sources of COP changed from mainly allochthonous in the Fox River, having mostly smaller sized colloids (1-3 kDa) and a lower organic carbon to phosphorus (C/P) ratio, to predominantly autochthonous in open bay waters with larger sized colloids (>10 kDa) and a higher organic C/P ratio. The observed high apparent distribution coefficients (k(d)) of P between dissolved and particulate phases and high-abundant autochthonous colloidal and particulate organic P in the hypereutrophic environment suggest that, in addition to phosphate, colloidal/particulate organic P may play a critical role in the biogeochemical cycling of P and the development of seasonal hypoxia.

Seven out of the ten typical PPCPs targeted were detected in all the water samples and sediment samples tested. The PPCPs concentration detected were 0-94.91 ng/L for water samples and 0-18.27 ng/g for sediment samples. Sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) and erythromycin (ERY) has relatively higher concentration than other PPCPs in surface water samples, ciprofloxacin (CIP) and ofloxacin (OFX) has relatively higher concentration in the sediment samples. Inflow river-Caoqiao river has a relatively highest contamination of TN and TP, the PPCPs concentration in the river channel, estuary, lake-body also shows high value. This occurs in both the surface water and sediment sample, implied a relatively high pollution input from Caoqiao river. SMZ holds high long-term ecological risks in both surface water and sediment of almost all the tested inflow rivers of Taihu lake. Only ERY has medium short-term risks in surface water, other analyzed PPCPs hold low or insignificant short-terms risks for both surface water and sediments. This study fills the gap of PPCPs ecological risk of surface water and sediment of 12 typical inflow rivers of Taihu Lake, and revealed the importance of control sulfanilamide of the economic belt around Taihu Lake. The results of the present study are useful in providing information for PPCPs control and sustainable water management in freshwater lakes.

The effect of eCO(2) is built into Earth system models, although testing the relationship over long periods remains challenging. Here, we explore the relative importance of six drivers of vegetation change in western Africa over the past similar to 500,000 years (moisture availability, fire activity, mammalian herbivore density, temperature, temperature seasonality, CO2) by coupling past environmental change data from Lake Bosumtwi (Ghana) with global data. We found that moisture availability and fire activity were the most important factors in determining woody cover, whereas the effect of CO2 was small. Our findings suggest that the role of eCO(2) effects on tropical vegetation in predictive models must be reconsidered.					; Holden, Philip/K-6152-2013; Gosling, William/D-2459-2009; Shanahan, Timothy/B-1298-2012	Shanahan, Timothy/0000-0002-3831-3198; Van Langevelde, Frank/0000-0001-8870-0797; Gosling, William/0000-0001-9903-8401; Holden, Philip/0000-0002-2369-0062													0036-8075	1095-9203				MAY 6	2022	376	6593					653	+		10.1126/science.abg4618	http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.abg4618								35511966					WOS:000796932700048

From five different locations across the coastal area, 44 finfish species from 11 orders and 33 families were collected. Four finfish species such as Mugil cephalus, Lates calcarifer, Etroplus suratensis, and Chanos chanos were used to estimate and assess the heavy metal concentrations based on abundance and distribution across coastal area. Results revealed that the metal concentration in these fish species, water, and sediment were all found to be significantly comparable. During the southwest monsoon season, the highest concentrations of metals were found in Chanos chanos, Mugil cephalus, and Lates calcarifer. A hazard index and a target hazard quotient were calculated to determine the human-related health risk. Except for Hg and Cd in children, the anthropological health hazard assessment revealed that most element exposure doses are safe for both children and adults.					; Rajagopal, Dr. Rajakrishnan/AFN-4667-2022; Chang, Soon/CAE-9543-2022; Mukherjee, Amitava/H-5560-2011; Ayyamperumal, Ramamoorthy/AAH-8627-2021; Alfarhan, Ahmed/GQH-6118-2022; Arunachalam, Kantha Deivi/H-5846-2011; Chandrasekaran, Murugesan/AAP-5037-2020; Balasubramani, Ravindran/G-7798-2019; Arunachalam, Kantha/H-5846-2011	chang, soon woong/0000-0002-6005-1796; Mukherjee, Amitava/0000-0001-8682-4278; AYYAMPERUMAL, RAMAMOORTHY/0000-0002-7903-4267; Chandrasekaran, Murugesan/0000-0002-8520-252X; Arunachalam, Kantha Deivi/0000-0001-5510-1333; Rajagopal, Rajakrishnan/0000-0003-0917-7673; Balasubramani, Ravindran/0000-0001-8764-7840; 													0269-7491	1873-6424				FEB 1	2022	294								118553	10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118553	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118553								34871642					WOS:000758403300007

The water levels of these alpine lakes respond directly to water balance, but are mainly known only on the interannual scale. Seasonal variations are still poorly described due to limited gauge measurements. Here, the seasonal trends and cycles of lake-level changes on the Tibetan Plateau were examined using altimetry data from ICESat (132 available lakes), Cryosat-2 (244 lakes), Sentinel-3A (125 lakes), Sentinel-3B (120 lakes), and ICESat-2 (356 lakes). Bias between altimetry data sets was removed, and a validation against in-situ lake-level measurements from Qinghai Lake between 2003 and 2020 revealed a good performance (R-2 > 0.80, RMSE < 0.12 m). The mean annual trend of lake level between 2003 and 2020 is 0.20 +/- 0.01 m/yr, with similar rates (0.18-0.20 m/yr) in three different seasons. The rate was slightly greater (0.22 +/- 0.02 m/yr) between 2010 and 2020, but seasonal trends were again similar in this period (0.21-0.25 m/yr). Declining water levels for lakes around Nam Co were identified, with a mean negative rate of -0.09 +/- 0.02 m/yr. Furthermore, during 2016-2020, an accelerated lake-level rise was found, with a mean rate of 0.43 +/- 0.05 m/yr (0.47-0.53 m/yr in four seasons). Lake levels in the southern TP are shown to have increased during 2016-2019: a reversal of the pre-2016 observations of declining levels. The seasonal cycles of lake-level variations show that the majority of lakes have a peak water level in August-September, followed by October-November. The features of the peaks vary distinctly in different climate regions, with the timing of the peak occurring gradually later as one moves from southwest to northeast. The seasonal cycles of water level and terrestrial water storage from GRACE data are highly consistent. The spatial pattern of lake-level changes during the seasonal period of rising lake levels also matches precipitation variations well, as does lake volume change with terrestrial water storage budget. The study reveals the tremendous potential of multi-sensor altimetry data for detecting seasonal features of lake-level variation, which is a great asset for understanding Earth's water dynamics and balance.

The Composition and Function of Microbiomes Within Microcystis Colonies Are Significantly Different Than Native Bacterial Assemblages in Two North American Lakes	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												The toxic cyanobacteriumMicrocystisis one of the most pervasive harmful algal bloom (HAB) genera and naturally occurs in large colonies known to harbor diverse heterotrophic bacterial assemblages. While colony-associated microbiomes may influenceMicrocystisblooms, there remains a limited understanding of the structure and functional potential of these communities and how they may be shaped by changing environmental conditions. To address this gap, we compared the dynamics ofMicrocystis-attached (MCA), free-living (FL), and whole water (W) microbiomes duringMicrocystisblooms using next-generation amplicon sequencing (16S rRNA), a predictive metagenome software, and other bioinformatic approaches. Microbiomes were monitored through high resolution spatial-temporal surveys across two North American lakes, Lake Erie (LE) and Lake Agawam (LA; Long Island, NY, United States) in 2017, providing the largest dataset of these fractions to date. Sequencing of 126 samples generated 7,922,628 sequences that clustered into 7,447 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) with 100% sequence identity. Across lakes, the MCA microbiomes were significantly different than the FL and W fractions being significantly enriched inGemmatimonadetes,Burkholderiaceae,Rhizobiales, andCytophagalesand depleted ofActinobacteria.Further, although MCA communities harbored > 900 unique ASVs, they were significantly less diverse than the other fractions with diversity inversely related to bloom intensity, suggesting increased selection pressure on microbial communities as blooms intensified. Despite taxonomic differences between lakes, predicted metagenomes revealed conserved functional potential among MCA microbiomes. MCA communities were significantly enriched in pathways involved in N and P cycling and microcystin-degradation. Taxa potentially capable of N-2-fixation were significantly enriched (p< 0.05) and up to four-fold more abundant within the MCA faction relative to other fractions, potentially aiding in the proliferation ofMicrocystisblooms during low N conditions. The MCA predicted metagenomes were conserved over 8 months of seasonal changes in temperature and N availability despite strong temporal succession in microbiome composition. Collectively, these findings indicate thatMicrocystiscolonies harbor a statistically distinct microbiome with a conserved functional potential that may help facilitate bloom persistence under environmentally unfavorable conditions.

J	Shi, JC; Wang, LX; Yang, YR; Huang, TL				Shi, Jianchao; Wang, Lianxiang; Yang, Yongrui; Huang, Tinglin			A case study of thermal and chemical stratification in a drinking water reservoir	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Thermal stratification has an important impact on the cycling of reservoir water quality. Uneven vertical distribution of water quality factors, such as dissolved oxygen and nutrients, occurs during seasonal stratification, which creates chemical stratification. Typically, thermocline and chemocline characteristics vary across different reservoirs. In this study, a field study was conducted in the Zhoucun Reservoir (ZCR), China, to investigate the variation in water quality during periods of thermal stratification. The results revealed the maximum water depth as 15 m at 122 mamsl, which is relatively shallow for stratified reservoirs. However, an extremely high thermocline strength index (TSI) was recorded, which indicates that the thermal stratification of ZCR water is very stable, contrary to our common understanding that stratification is more obvious at greater water depths. The chemical stratification strength index (IC-i) was compared with the TSI and the relative water column stability (RWCS). The TSI had a high correlation with IC-i, which explains the high stability of ZCR chemical stratification. Moreover, it highlights the suitability of TSI for characterising the chemical stability of reservoir stratification. Finally, this study also found that the formation and disappearance of thermal and chemical stratification in the ZCR were synchronous. As stratification directly influences a reservoir water quality regime, this study may be a helpful reference for optimising water quality management.

Given its presence in various products, a great quantity of PAEs flows into different aquatic systems each year. Hence, it is important to study the pollution levels and ecological risk of PAEs. This study investigated the distribution and seasonal variation of six priority PAEs in the surface water of Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China. In the wet season, the mean concentration of the total PAEs was 0.544 +/- 0.173 mu g/L, while the dry season concentration (1.003 +/- 0.451 mu g/L) nearly doubled. The most abundant PAE congeners were di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), followed by bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). To evaluate the ecological risks in Poyang Lake, the predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) of four PAEs based on non-lethal effects were derived. For diethyl phthalate (DEP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), DBP, and DEHP, the PNECs were 31.6, 3.30, 2.31, and 0.0210 mu g/L, respectively. The tiered ecological risk assessment showed that DEP and BBP posed no risk in Poyang Lake. Meanwhile, DBP posed a potential risk in Poyang Lake, but the risk of DEHP was unacceptable and requires more actions. Specifically, the probabilities of exceeding the threshold for the protection of 95% of the aquatic organisms (HC5) were 3.30% and 4.43% for DEHP in the wet and dry season, respectively. This study provides an appropriate reference for the surface water management of PAE pollution in China. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study presents a detailed optical comparison between three representative CSP collector designs including linear Fresnel, parabolic trough, and central-receiver technologies. Optical models are implemented in SolTrace, which is ray-tracing software developed at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The ray-tracing algorithm is used to calculate a collector's design-point performance as well as its incidence-angle modifiers to evaluate the collector performance at any sun position during a typical meteorological year. The efficiency over a one-year period is then analyzed based on ray-tracing results. Using China Lake (California) as an example, the annual optical efficiency is 60% for the selected parabolic trough collector, 52% for the selected central-receiver technology, and 40% for the selected linear Fresnel collector. The parabolic trough has the highest optical performance among all. The selected central-receiver technology provides the most consistent seasonal production profile over the course of the year due to its two-axis-tracking ability but would suffer most from the increasing solar collector optical error. It is also shown that a dramatic cost reduction is required for the selected linear Fresnel technology to be competitive in the future energy market. Sensitivity of three CSP technologies to the deployment locations and the overall optical-error magnitude is also examined through annual performance analysis. The results will provide insights into a better understanding on inherent technical aspects of different CSP technologies.					; Kincaid, Nicholas/KFR-2344-2024	Zhu, Guangdong/0000-0001-9280-285X; 													0306-2619	1872-9118				DEC 1	2018	231						1109	1121		10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.09.153	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.09.153													WOS:000452345400086

Between 3,000 y ago and 2,000 y ago, regional pollen sequences indicate a replacement of mature rainforests by a forest-savannah mosaic including pioneer trees. Although some studies suggested an anthropogenic influence on this forest fragmentation, current interpretations based on pollen data attribute the "rainforest crisis" to climate change toward a drier, more seasonal climate. A rigorous test of this hypothesis, however, requires climate proxies independent of vegetation changes. Here we resolve this controversy through a continuous 10,500-y record of both vegetation and hydrological changes from Lake Barombi in Southwest Cameroon based on changes in carbon and hydrogen isotope compositions of plant waxes. delta C-13-inferred vegetation changes confirm a prominent and abrupt appearance of C-4 plants in the Lake Barombi catchment, at 2,600 calendar years before AD 1950 (cal y BP), followed by an equally sudden return to rainforest vegetation at 2,020 cal y BP. delta D values from the same plant wax compounds, however, show no simultaneous hydrological change. Based on the combination of these data with a comprehensive regional archaeological database we provide evidence that humans triggered the rainforest fragmentation 2,600 y ago. Our findings suggest that technological developments, including agricultural practices and iron metallurgy, possibly related to the large-scale Bantu expansion, significantly impacted the ecosystems before the Common Era.					; Epp, Laura Saskia/J-5301-2016; Garcin, Yannick/IUQ-1103-2023; Schefuß, Enno/A-7101-2015; Schefuss, Enno/A-7101-2015; Deschamps, Pierre/M-9632-2013; Epp, Laura/AFS-1695-2022; SEBAG, David/A-4139-2008; Sachse, Dirk/D-3410-2012; Menot, Guillemette/A-5403-2017; Ménot, Guillemette/A-5403-2017	Brauer, Achim/0000-0002-6655-9451; Epp, Laura Saskia/0000-0002-2230-9477; Garcin, Yannick/0000-0001-8205-494X; Dupont, Lydie/0000-0001-9531-6793; Schefuss, Enno/0000-0002-5960-930X; Deschamps, Pierre/0000-0003-1687-3765; SEBAG, David/0000-0002-6446-6921; Menot, Guillemette/0000-0003-2423-8294; Tjallingii, Rik/0000-0002-9723-3622; 													0027-8424	1091-6490				MAR 27	2018	115	13					3261	3266		10.1073/pnas.1715336115	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1715336115								29483260					WOS:000428382400038

This lake receives excess fertilizer runoff from agriculture and approximately 2.3 Hm(3) per year of poorly treated wastewater from three municipal treatment plants. Thirteen water quality parameters were monitored at five sampling points within the lake over 9 years. The objective of this work was to characterize the spatial and temporal variations of the water quality and to identify the sources of data variability in order to assess the influence and the impact of different natural and anthropogenic processes. One-way ANOVA tests, principal component analysis (PCA), cluster analysis (CA), and discriminant analysis (DA) were implemented. The one-way ANOVA showed that biochemical oxygen demand and pH present statistically significant spatial variations and that alkalinity, total chloride, conductivity, chemical oxygen demand, total hardness, ammonia, pH, total dissolved solids, and temperature present statistically significant temporal variations. PCA results explained both natural and anthropogenic processes and their relationship with water quality data. The CA results suggested there is no significant spatial variation in the water quality of the lake because of lake mixing caused by wind. The most significant parameters for spatial variations were pH, NO3-, and NO2-, consistent with the configuration of point and nonpoint sources that affect the lake's water quality. The temporal DA results suggested that conductivity, hardness, NO2-, pH, and temperature were the most significant parameters to discriminate between seasons. The temporal behavior of these parameters was associated with the transport pathways of seasonal contaminants.

The field samplings were conducted in April (dry season) and August (wet season) 2018, the results showed that QNs was extensively distributed in the Baiyangdian Lake. For the occurrence, Flumequine (FLU) and Ofloxacin (OFL) were the most detected QNs in Baiyangdian Lake. For the temporal variation, the sum concentration of QNs in water and sediment were ranged from 153 ng/L to 3093 ng/L and from 40.1 ng/g to 1475 ng/g in April, while ranged from 3.83 ng/L to 769 ng/L and from 20.3 ng/g to 373 ng/g in August. For the spatial variation, all of QNs exhibited significance difference in concentration at different sampling areas. Furthermore, PNEC plays an important role in ecological risk assessment, thus the PNECs of FLU and OFL were derived by assessment factors (AF), species sensitivity distribution (SSD), and AQUATOX model methods. The results showed that: PNECAFs, PNECSSDs, and PNECAQUATOXs were 18.7 mu g/L, 196 mu g/L, and 128 mu g/L for FLU, respectively; and were 0.021 mu g/L, 4.40 mu g/L, and 3.00 mu g/L for OFL, respectively. The PNECs for FLU and OFL derived by three approaches showed the rank of: PNECSSDs > PNECAQUATOXs > PNECAFs; while the risk quotients (RQs) followed the other rank of: RQ(SSDs) < RQ(AQUATOXs) < RQ(AFs). The results was indicated that the indirect ecological effects plays an important role in the derived PNECs for QNs, without considering the indirect ecological effects in natural ecosystem can lead to under-protective or over-protective PNECs (RQs) for chemicals. Therefore, AQUATOX model can be applied in deriving PNECs during the ecological risk assessment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In three out of four sites, exponential accumulation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) with depth was observed with the signature of seasonal variability. Except for the site displaying a below-detection limit of Fe(II), the general accumulation trends of DOC with depth was concurrent with the increases of Fe(II) and NH4+ and the decrease of PO43-, signifying a close linkage of the DOM dynamics with anaerobic respiration via iron reduction, an important early diagenesis pathway. The estimated benthic fluxes from the cores revealed that the sediments likely serve as DOC, chromophoric DOM (CDOM), and fluorescent DOM (FDOM) sources to the overlying water. The benthic effluxes based on DOC were comparable to the ranges previously reported in lake and coastal areas, and those of CDOM and FDOM showed even higher levels. These findings imply that impoundment-affected river systems would change the DOM composition of the overlying water, ultimately influencing the subsequent water treatment processes such as disinfection byproducts production and membrane fouling. A simple mass balance model indicated that the impoundment-affected river sediments may operate as a net carbon sink in the environments due to a greater extent of sedimentation compared to the estimated benthic efflux and sediment biological respiration.

Airborne PCBs and OH-PCBs Inside and Outside Urban and Rural US Schools	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												PCBs appear in school air because many school buildings were built when PCBs were still intentionally added to building materials and because PCBs are also present through inadvertent production in modern pigment. This is of concern because children are especially vulnerable to the toxic effects of PCBs. Here we report indoor and outdoor air concentrations of PCBs and OH-PCBs from two rural schools and four urban schools, the latter near a PCB-contaminated waterway of Lake Michigan in the United States. Samples (n = 108) were collected as in/out pairs using polyurethane foam passive air samplers (PUF-PAS) from January 2012 to November 2015. Samples were analyzed using GC/MS-MS for all 209 PCBs and 72 OH-PCBs. Concentrations inside schools were 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than outdoors and ranged from 0.5 to 194 ng/m(3) (PCBs) and from 4 to 665 pg/m(3) (OH-PCBs). Congener profiles were similar within each sampling location across season but different between schools and indicated the sources as Aroclors from building materials and individual PCBs associated with modern pigment. This study is the first cohort-specific analysis to show that some children's PCB inhalation exposure may be equal to or higher than their exposure through diet.					; Herkert, Nicholas/T-7213-2019; Hornbuckle, Keri/JCO-2746-2023; Thorne, Peter/F-2225-2014	Marek, Rachel/0000-0002-7898-2900; Thorne, Peter/0000-0002-5045-0929; Awad, Andrew/0000-0002-0687-8864; Herkert, Nicholas/0000-0002-3286-8934; Hornbuckle, Keri/0000-0002-3478-3221													0013-936X	1520-5851				JUL 18	2017	51	14					7853	7860		10.1021/acs.est.7b01910	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b01910								28656752					WOS:000406086100012

Contamination and ecological risk assessment of Cr, As, Cd and Pb in water and sediment of the southeastern Bay of Bengal coast in a developing country	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Safe levels of heavy metals in the surface water and sediment of the eastern Bay of Bengal coast have not been universally established. Current study characterized heavy metals such as arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) in surface water and sediments of the most important fishing resource at the eastern Bay of Bengal coast, Bangladesh. Both water and sediment samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Considering both of the seasons, the mean concentrations of Cr, As, Cd, and Pb in water samples were 33.25, 8.14, 0.48, and 21.14 mu g/L, respectively and in sediment were 30.47, 4.48, 0.20, and 19.98 mg/kg, respectively. Heavy metals concentration in water samples surpassed the acceptable limits of usable water quality, indicating that water from this water resource is not safe for drinking, cooking, bathing, and any other uses. Enrichment factors also directed minor enrichment of heavy metals in sediment of the coast. Other indexes for ecological risk assessment such as pollution load index (PLI), contamination factor (CF), geoaccumulation index (Igeo), modified contamination degree (mCd), and potential ecological risk index (PERI) also indicated that sediment of the coastal watershed was low contamination. In-depth inventorying of heavy metals in both water and sediment of the study area are required to determine ecosystem health for holistic risk assessment and management.

J	Varol, M; Sünbül, MR				Varol, Memet; Sunbul, Muhammet Rasit			Multiple approaches to assess human health risks from carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic metals via consumption of five fish species froma large reservoir in Turkey	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Keban Dam Reservoir (KDR), located on the Euphrates River (Turkey), is an internationally important reservoir. In this study, levels of ten metals in 220 muscle samples of five fish species (mangar, common carp, Tigris scraper, Euphrates barbell and trout barb) taken from 11 sampling sites in the KDR were determined and compared with the results of previous studies carried out in other countries and Turkey. In addition, multiple approaches were used to assess human health risks from fish consumption. The significant spatial differences in concentrations of studied metals except As and Ni in Euphrates barbell were not found. However, concentrations of all metals except Cd showed significant seasonal differences. The concentrations of ten metals in fish species were lower than or comparable to those in fish species from other freshwater bodies. The metal concentrations in all fish species were found below the maximum permissible concentrations. No health risks of studied heavy metals on human were found by daily fish intake. The target hazard quotient (THQ) and total THQ values were below 1, which suggests there are no significant non-carcinogenic health risks for fish consumers. The cancer risk values calculated for inorganic arsenic in all fish species except Euphrates barbell did not exceed the 10-6 threshold. The allowable number of fish meals per month can be categorized as safe fish consumption. The results of this study revealed that the consumption of the examined fish species does not pose a significant risk to human health. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Assessment of phosphorus loading dynamics in a tropical reservoir with high seasonal water level changes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Nutrient accumulation in man-made reservoirs has been documented worldwide. Therefore, quantifying phosphorus loading and understanding its temporal dynamics in reservoirs is mandatory for sustainable water management. In this study, the Vollenweider's complete-mix phosphorus budget model was adapted to account for high water level variations, which are a common feature in tropical reservoirs, and for internal phosphorus loads. First- and zero-order kinetics were adopted to simulate phosphorus settling and release from the sediment layer, respectively, considering variable area of phosphorus release according to the height of the anoxic layer. The modeling approach was applied for a 52-months period to a 31-years-old reservoir located in the semiarid region of Brazil with 7.7 hm3 storage capacity. The simulations were supported by hydrological, meteorological and water quality data, as well as analyses of phosphorus partitioning of the reservoir bed sediment. The external phosphorus load was estimated from a relationship adjusted between inflow and phosphorus concentration, revealing an u-shaped pattern. Sedimentary phosphorus linked to iron and aluminum (PFeAl) increased over time and along the reservoir. Such measurements were used to estimate the internal phosphorus load, i.e., the yield from the bed sediments to the water column. The adaptations proposed to the model's structure improved its capacity to simulate phosphorus concentration in the water column, from "not satisfactory" to "good". We estimate that the internal phosphorus load currently accounts for 44% of the total load. It prevailed during the wet period, when reservoir stratification and hypolimnetic hypoxia were more notable, resulting in higher phosphorus concentration in the water column due to the combined effects of internal and external loadings. However, if the reservoir were 70 years older, the internal load would reach 83% of the total and the reservoir would become a source instead of a sink of phosphorus.

This is important because the Blue Nile is the main tributary to the Nile river, the lifeline of both Sudan and Egypt. Therefore, to begin with long-term trends in hydrological time series were detected by means of both parametric and nonparametric techniques. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was calibrated using several sub-basins and new high-resolution land use and soil maps. Future climate change impacts were projected using data from the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) of the National Centers for Environmental Predictions based on three different climate change scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3). Projected time series were analysed for changes in rainfall and streamflow trends. Climate change scenario modelling suggested that the precipitation will increase from 7% to 48% and that streamflow from the BNB could increase by 21% to 97%. The results provide a basis for evaluating future impacts of climate change on the upper Blue Nile River (Abay River). This is the main river basin contributing to the Nile and a source of water for millions of people in Sudan and Egypt, downstream from Ethiopia. Three models (CCCMA, CNRM, MRI) were applied in this research, within two future time periods (2046-2064 and 2081-2099) and one scenario (A1B). The Abay Basin was divided into seven sub-basins, six of which were used as inlets to the lowest basin at the border to Sudan. The above-mentioned results show that under current climate change scenarios there is a strong seasonal shift to be expected from the present main rainfall season (June to September) to an earlier onset from January to May with less pronounced peaks but longer duration of the rainfall season. This has direct consequences on the streamflow of the Blue Nile, which is connected to the rainfall season and therefore has direct effects on the people living in the sphere of influence of the Nile River.

Quantifying environmental emissions of microplastics from urban rivers in Melbourne, Australia	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												This study aims to understand the amount and type of microplastics flowing into Port Phillip Bay from urban rivers around Melbourne. Water samples were collected from the Patterson, Werribee, Maribyrnong, and Yarra Rivers, which contribute 97 % to the total flow into Port Phillip Bay. On average, the rivers contained a mean of 9 +/- 15 microplastics/L and ranged from 4 +/- 3 microplastics/L (Patterson) to 22 +/- 11 microplastics/L (Werribee). Of the eight polymers investigated, polyamide and polypropylene were the most frequently detected polymers. Using the mean concentration of each river, the flow of microplastics into Port Philip Bay was estimated to be 7.5 x 106 microplastics per day and 3.7 x 1010 microplastics per year. To fully understand the fate and transport of microplastics into Port Phillip Bay, this study would be the foundation for a more in-depth investigation. Here, further samples will be collected at more points along the river and at the midpoint of each season.					; Ellis, Amanda/AAD-3450-2019; Clarke, Bradley/U-9333-2017	Samandra, Subharhte/0000-0002-4060-594X; Plaisted, Katie/0000-0001-7952-6846; Clarke, Bradley/0000-0002-4559-9585													0025-326X	1879-3363				APR	2023	189								114709	10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.114709	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.114709		FEB 2023						36821931					WOS:000948928300001
J	Ongoma, V; Chen, HS; Gao, CJ				Ongoma, Victor; Chen, Haishan; Gao, Chujie			Projected changes in mean rainfall and temperature over East Africa based on CMIP5 models	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												This study presents potential future variations of mean rainfall and temperature over East Africa (EA) based on five models that participated in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and representative concentration pathways (RCPs): 4.5 and 8.5. In this study, climate simulations of two timeframes, a baseline period (1961-1990) and projection period (2071-2100), are compared. The models reproduce EA's bimodal rainfall pattern but overestimate and underestimate seasonal rainfall of October-December (OND) and March-May (MAM), respectively. Rainfall is projected to increase under the two scenarios. Larger increases in rainfall will occur during the OND season than during the MAM season and in RCP8.5 than in RCP4.5. During the last half of the 21st century, EA is likely to warm by 1.7-2.8 and 2.2-5.4 degrees C under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively, relative to the baseline period. Scenario uncertainty is projected to exceed model uncertainty from the middle to the end of the 21st century. The central parts of Kenya and the Lake Victoria Basin will witness the highest increases in seasonal rainfall. The probability density functions (PDFs) of future seasonal rainfall show a positive shift and a statistically insignificant increase in variance relative to the baseline. Thus, EA is likely to experience an increase in extreme rainfall events. Understanding the future climate variability in EA is important for planning purposes but these results are based on relatively course resolution models prone to bias and therefore should be used with caution. There is a need for further research on climate projections over EA, including determining the causes of the poor performance of global models in reproducing rainfall climatology and trends over the region.

Based on the daily records from 16 meteorological stations and 7 gauging stations in the Poyang Lake Basin from 1960 to 2015, the contributions of climate change and human activities to runoff variations under different timescales (annual, flood season, and non-flood season) were explored using the Mann-Kendall, Moving-T test, and a linear regression model. The results showed that on annual timescale, climate change accounted for 91.88% of the increased runoff depth. However, intensive human activities in the subbasins would have reduced the runoff depth in the Poyang Lake Basin. The impact of climate change on the variation of runoff depth increased during the flood season. Climate change and human activities contributed similar to 57% and similar to 42%, respectively. Both climate change and human activities could increase the runoff depth during the non-flood season.

In the advent of extreme wetness or drought events, reliable precipitation estimates for local characterization is a long overdue process. In the present study, four Satellite derived Precipitation Estimates (SPE): TMPA V7 3B42, PERSIANN-CDR, CHIRPS, and ARC2, are assessed over four homogeneous zones in Kenya with gauge based data during 1998-2016. Results show that variations of SPE products are based on complex geomorphology of different climatic zones. All SPE products depict bimodal annual precipitation pattern with west-east gradient representing heavier to lighter precipitation events. The Monthly analysis reveal good statistical agreement with reference datasets despite underestimation of precipitation in most regions. Seasonal precipitation events show that the PERSI-ANN-CDR perform better along low altitude humid climate and western zones around Lake Basin while ARC2 has uniform performance as gauge stations over highlands regions. Strong positive linear relationship on annual scale is evident in most SPE products with CHIRPS, ARC2, and TMPA exhibiting relatively high correlation (r) and minimum root mean square error (RMSE), except for PERSIANN-CDR. Overall, the findings of this study show the potentials of SPE products for applications over study domain. The TMPA V7 and PERSIANN-CDR could be useful in understanding individual floods events. Since the CHIRPS perform relatively well over ASAL regions, it could be utilized in monitoring droughts events.

The post-construction low-flow water level at the same discharge below the dam has declined, but there remains disagreement over whether the flood level has increased. Measured water levels and upstream and downstream flow data from 1955 to 2016 show that, post-construction: (1) the low-flow water level at the same discharge decreased, and the lowest water level increased due to dry-season reservoir discharge; (2) the decline of the low-flow water level below the dam was less than the undercutting value of the flow channel of the river; (3) the flood level at the same discharge below the dam was slightly elevated, although peak water levels decreased; (4) flood characteristics changed from a high discharge-high flood level to a medium discharge-high flood level; and (5) an expected decline in the flood level downstream was not observed. Channel erosion and the adjustment of rivers and lakes tend to reduce flood levels, while river bed coarsening, vegetation, and human activities downstream increase the flood level. Although the flood control benefits of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) and the upstream reservoirs are obvious, increased elevation of the downstream flood level remains a concern.					yang, yunping/ACF-3066-2022														2045-2322					NOV 15	2017	7								15640	10.1038/s41598-017-15677-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-15677-y								29142268					WOS:000415265800051

However, there remains a large gap on DOM compositions and source proportion, as well as factors driving DOM chemical compositions and source variations in monsoonal rivers of China. Here, 126 water samples were collected from monsoonal rivers in both dry and wet seasons in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) region, an area characterized by monsoonal climate. We therefore consequently investigated the temporal and spatial variations of DOM compositions and sources using UV-Visible absorption and fluorescence excitation emission matrix (EEM)-parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) as well as principal component analysis (PCA). There was higher degree of humification, aromaticity and lignin substances of DOM in the wet season than in the dry season. EEM-PARAFAC analysis identified four fluorescent components of DOM in the dry season and three components in the wet season. More protein-like component (tryptophan-like) was identified in the dry season when compared to the wet season, demonstrating that biological and autochthonous sources were the primary source of DOM in the dry season. PCA and the percentage of components also demonstrated more autochthonous sources and weaker terrestrial sources of DOM in the dry season. The spatial distribution of DOM optical properties demonstrated the higher protein abundance and lower molecular weight in urban land use and farmland area along the river bank. The findings demonstrated that hydrological seasonality and anthropogenic activities were key drivers for the DOM compositions and sources variations, which will improve our understanding on the crucial role of DOM in biogeochemical cycle, as well as help to guide water quality protection in the monsoonal rivers.

The results show that 52 pesticides, including 21 insec-ticides, 10 fungicides, and 21 herbicides, were detectable in the surface water. The concentrations of target pesticides in water samples ranged from 0.42 (tebuconazole in the wet season) to 645.31 ng/L (thiamethoxam in the normal sea-son). The two most polluting and widespread pesticides were quintozene (maximum concentration of 481.46 ng/L and detection rate of 94 %) and atrazine (maximum concentration of 465.73 ng/L and detection rate of 100 %). The total pesticide concentrations in surface water in different seasons revealed the order of dry season > wet season > normal season. Based on aquatic pesticide concentrations, their frequency of occurrence, and effect concentrations, insecti-cides posed higher risks to aquatic organisms and human health than either fungicides or herbicides. Total pesticide concentrations were significantly positively correlated with suspended particulate matter, dissolved organic carbon, soil pH, normalized difference vegetation index, adjacent cropland area; and were negatively associated with adjacent grassland area. The cropland area largely influences pesticide distribution in the surface water of the Jiaodong Peninsula.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				APR 20	2023	870								161872	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161872	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161872		JAN 2023						36716873					WOS:000927061000001
J	Caballero, I; Navarro, G				Caballero, Isabel; Navarro, Gabriel			Monitoring cyanoHABs and water quality in Laguna Lake (Philippines) with Sentinel-2 satellites during the 2020 Pacific typhoon season	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Laguna Lake, the largest freshwater lake in the Philippines, is permanently subject to nutrient-driven eutrophication and pollution and experiences harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) periodically with serious socio-economic implications. The aim of this study is to evaluate the suitability of the Sentinel-2 imagery of the European Commission's Copernicus Earth Observation programme for lake monitoring during the 2020 Pacific typhoon season (September-November 2020). The Case-2 Regional Coast Colour processor is used to atmospherically correct Level 1 data and generate water quality parameters, such as chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and total suspended matter (TSM) at 10 m. Results show that Super Typhoon Goni and Typhoon Vamco delivered high suspended sediment loads to the reservoir at concentrations above 170 g/m(3) compared to pre-storm situations (0-35 g/m(3)). The typhoons also affect Chl-a, with a mean concentration of 10 mg/m(3) and 30 mg/m(3) for pre- and post-typhoons, respectively. In addition, the normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI) is used in the Google Earth Engine platform for near-real time monitoring of cyano HABs at 20 m spatial resolution. Satellite maps are key for detecting the distribution of the blooms due to the patchiness of the green algae species, which usually form scum and elongated slicks in the lake. Maximum records of bloom detection during the study period occur in the Central Bay, one of the lake sections with major aquaculture and fisheries activities. The Sentinel-2 mission improves synoptic mapping of cyanoHABs and enables trends in their extent and severity to be documented. These available methods provide an essential tool for rapid detection after extreme events and for regularwater quality monitoring, which will assist and benefit the cost-effective management of Laguna Lake.

However, the seasonal and spatial dynamics of free-living (FL) and particle-attached (PA) bacteria and the environmental factors shaping this relationship remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we explored the spatiotemporal patterns of bacterial community composition (BCC) in Lake Taihu, China, using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and 454-tag pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene. We generated a total of 218,027 high quality non-cyanobacterial sequence reads that resulted in 4940 OTUs (97% cutoff), with Actinobacteria, beta- and alpha-proteobacteria being the predominant taxa. Although PA communities contained significantly higher alpha-diversity than FL ones, we found that 59% of OTUs, that accounted for 96% of the total reads, were shared by both communities. The high degree of overlap between FL and PA communities indicates a high rate of dispersal potential, highlighting an underestimated connectivity and potentially similar ecological role for these two components. Distinct seasonal trends were recorded in both FL and PA communities, while spatial differences in BCC were small. In addition, both FL and PA bacterial communities exhibited similar patterns and synchrony, correlated to water temperature, nitrate and total suspended solids (TSS). Accordingly, the effects of eutrophication and hydrodynamics on the phylogenetic overlap and diversity between FL and PA communities were discussed.

Satellite altimeters greatly promote the large-scale monitoring of lake level and storage variations. However, limited spatiotemporal coverage of the existing individual altimeters prevents long-term and spatially seamless observations on global lakes. These limitations are partially surmounted by the gridded digital elevation model (DEM) data, which can facilitate spatially contiguous measurements of lake bathymetry exposed at the low-level period. The high-resolution SRTM DEM has been widely used for estimating lake level variations due to its early collection time and reliable data quality, while how many lakes worldwide and to what extent of the newly inundated areas can be monitored based on SRTM DEM remains unexplored. Here, we conduct a quasi-global investigation of SRTM DEM regarding its capability of mapping inundated-area bathymetry and estimating lake storage variations. After generating a global-scale lake inventory (122,444 lakes below 60 degrees N, >1 km(2)) representing the maximum water inundation extents between 1984 and 2020, the feasibility of mapping lake inundated-area bathymetry was evaluated by comparing the maximum inundated area with the waterbody extent derived from SRTM DEM and analyzing the characteristics of interannual and seasonal variability of each lake. Results show that the maximum exposed lake bathymetries from the SRTM DEM data cover an area of 372,986 km(2), accounting for 15.95% of the maximum water area of our investigated lakes. Climate-driven lake expansions or human-induced reservoir impoundments after 2000 (the SRTM mission period) are the main contributors to the higher availability of SRTM DEM-based bathymetry mapping on the Tibetan Plateau, India, eastern China, and Amazon Plains. As the newly launched Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission is anticipated to monitor lake water budget variation at an unprecedented resolution, this study provides a base map for supplementing inundated bathymetry information. The joint use of SRTM and SWOT-based observations will extend the time and space extents of lake-level measurements, thereby enhancing our understanding of lake dynamics at a longer timescale.

Factors affecting the measurement of CDOM by remote sensing of optically complex inland waters	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												A combination of new measurements and analysis of historical data from several geographic regions was used to address four issues that affect the reliability and interpretation of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) measured by remote sensing of inland waters. First, high variability of CDOM levels in lakes and rivers was found at seasonal and multi-year time scales and at shorter intervals in some rivers and lakes. Coefficients of variation (CVs) of 30%-50% for absorptivity at 440 nm (a(440)) were common in historical and new data sets we examined. CDOM values used to calibrate imagery thus should be measured close to the image acquisition date, preferably within 1-2 months in lakes and a few days in large rivers, unless it can be shown that CDOM levels are temporally stable over longer (or shorter) time periods in a given aquatic system. Second, spectral slopes (S) for CDOM in the visible range vary little over time (even over multi-year periods) within sites. Substantial variation was found between sites, however, and most spectra showed a change in slope near 460 nm. Values of S400-460 for waters with moderate to high CDOM levels generally were within a narrow range (similar to 0.014-0.018) and similar to reported S values in the near UV. Values of S400-460 for waters with low CDOM generally were smaller and more variable, as were values for S460-650 for all waters. Overall, the variability of spectral slopes in the visible range should not have a large effect on the reliability of a(440) estimates made from remote sensing, which in many models involve reflectance measurements at wavelengths > 500 nm. Third, although a strong correlation (r(2) = 0.925) was found between CDOM levels and DOC concentrations in 34 surface waters sampled in 2013, the standard error of estimate suggests an uncertainty of similar to +/- 20% in predicting DOC at a(440) = 5 m(-1) (a moderate CDOM level). Moreover, CDOM-DOC relationships for unpublished data sets we analyzed and those reported in the literature indicate that both the fraction of DOC that is colored and slopes of regressions between CDOM and DOC are highly variable in space and time. Prediction of DOC concentrations in water bodies from CDOM levels (whether measured in the laboratory or by remote sensing) thus is associated with considerable uncertainty. For the present, this implies that field sampling is required to verify DOC concentrations predicted from remotely sensed CDOM measurements until we have a better understanding of variations in DOC-CDOM relationships. Fourth, shapes of reflectance spectra for CDOM-rich waters varied greatly depending on the concentrations of other constituents (suspended solids and chlorophyll) that affect the optical properties of water. Nonetheless, it is not obvious from our results for several predictive models that different remote sensing algorithms are needed to calculate CDOM levels accurately for waters where CDOM is the only variable affecting reflectance versus waters where other constituents also affect the spectra. The best band or band ratio models for simulated Landsat 8, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 bands from field measured reflectance spectra yielded high r(2) values (0.84-0.86) for a(440). The broader Landsat 8 bands worked nearly as well for a(440) as the narrower Sentinel band sets and hyperspectral bands, probably because CDOM is characterized by a broad exponential increase in absorbance with decreasing wavelength rather than specific peaks or troughs in absorbance or reflectance.

To elucidate co-occurrence, population dynamics, and synergistic interactions of honey bee pathogens, we established an array of diagnostic assays for a high-throughput qPCR platform. Assuming that interaction of pathogens requires co-occurrence within the same individual, single worker bees were analyzed instead of collective samples. Eleven viruses, four parasites, and three pathogenic bacteria were quantified in more than one thousand single bees sampled from sixteen disease-free apiaries in Southwest Germany. The most abundant viruses were black queen cell virus (84%), Lake Sinai virus 1 (42%), and deformed wing virus B (35%). Forager bees from asymptomatic colonies were infected with two different viruses in average, and simultaneous infection with four to six viruses was common (14%). Also, the intestinal parasites Nosema ceranae (96%) and Crithidia mellificae/Lotmaria passim (52%) occurred very frequently. These results indicate that low-level infections in honey bees are more common than previously assumed. All viruses showed seasonal variation, while N. ceranae did not. The foulbrood bacteria Paenibacillus larvae and Melissococcus plutonius were regionally distributed. Spearman's correlations and multiple regression analysis indicated possible synergistic interactions between the common pathogens, particularly for black queen cell virus. Beyond its suitability for further studies on honeybees, this targeted approach may be, due to its precision, capacity, and flexibility, a viable alternative to more expensive, sequencing-based approaches in nonmodel systems.					; Hasselmann, Martin/ABB-6485-2021	Hasselmann, Martin/0000-0003-3305-4024; Gihring, Katharina/0000-0001-6747-6298; 													2045-7758					SEP	2019	9	18					10241	10252		10.1002/ece3.5544	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.5544		AUG 2019						31624548					WOS:000481320700001

In this study, inter- and inner-annual variations of water level in Dongting Lake during the period of 1961-2010 were analyzed to determine whether anthropogenic or climatic factor should be responsible for the variations. The results showed that water level decreased significantly during the period of 1961-1980, while increased significantly during the period of 1981-2002 at the 5% significance level. However, the variation trend of water level after 2002 did not reach a significant level. The variation in the dry season was more obviously than that in the wet season. The date when water level was firstly below 24 m during the period of 2003-2010 appeared about 27 days earlier than usual, and the date was even advanced to mid-September in 2006. As for the duration, water level was below 24 m for about 185 days in the period of 2003-2010 and 20-30 days longer than the other two periods. In conclusion, water level might be influenced by a combination of anthropogenic and climatic factors, with rainfall probably as the main driver responsible for hydrological alteration during the period of 1961-1980 and 1981-2002 while dam construction as the main driver during the period of 2003-2010. Under the circumstance of uncontrollable climate change, effective measures for reservoir operation should be put forward to maintain the ecological integrity and ensure water release and storage capacity of aquatic ecosystems.

Given their global prevalence, how GHG fluxes from shallow lakes are altered by climate change may have profound implications for the global carbon cycle. Empirical evidence for the temperature dependence of the processes controlling GHG production in natural systems is largely based on the correlation between seasonal temperature variation and seasonal change in GHG fluxes. However, ecosystem-level GHG fluxes could be influenced by factors, which while varying seasonally with temperature are actually either indirectly related (e.g. primary producer biomass) or largely unrelated to temperature, for instance nutrient loading. Here, we present results from the longest running shallow-lake mesocosm experiment which demonstrate that nutrient concentrations override temperature as a control of both the total and individual GHG flux. Furthermore, testing for temperature treatment effects at low and high nutrient levels separately showed only one, rather weak, positive effect of temperature (CH4 flux at high nutrients). In contrast, at low nutrients, the CO2 efflux was lower in the elevated temperature treatments, with no significant effect on CH4 or N2O fluxes. Further analysis identified possible indirect effects of temperature treatment. For example, at low nutrient levels, increased macrophyte abundance was associated with significantly reduced fluxes of both CH4 and CO2 for both total annual flux and monthly observation data. As macrophyte abundance was positively related to temperature treatment, this suggests the possibility of indirect temperature effects, via macrophyte abundance, on CH4 and CO2 flux. These findings indicate that fluxes of GHGs from shallow lakes may be controlled more by factors indirectly related to temperature, in this case nutrient concentration and the abundance of primary producers. Thus, at ecosystem scale, response to climate change may not follow predictions based on the temperature dependence of metabolic processes.

In order to assess such negative effects, we compared long-term (2012-2018) water quality dynamics of four ponds that are fed by runoff from agricultural hillsides with contrasting slopes and land cover near Tianmu Lake in Eastern China. Averaged total nitrogen (TN) levels in ponds increased from 7.0 mg L-1 to 10.0 mg L-1 when the cultivated slopes above them doubled from 8 degrees to 16 degrees. In contrast, total phosphorus (TP) levels varied modestly from 0.05 to 0.07 mg L-1 among the four ponds. Values were lower when drained hillslopes had good vegetation coverage and/or buffer strips. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that relatively high precipitation is the determining factor for N loss from gentle hillsides, but as slope gradients increase, the frequency of rainfall events becomes the major influential factor. TP loss was associated with strong rainfall events and can be greatly reduced if hillsides are well covered with vegetation. When vegetation cover is removed, nutrient loss, especially N, is heightened. Our results underscore the significance of agricultural cultivation of steep hillsides in exacerbating N and P pollution and highlight the value of forests and grasslands in reducing nutrient loss from these sensitive areas. An integrated strategy that includes controlling land exploitation, source control, delivery interception, and pond management should be considered to minimize nutrient loss in hilly areas prone to rapid agricultural expansion.

F.; Tan, Lishan; Jin, Baoshi; Tong, Chuan			Fluxes of carbon dioxide and methane across the water-atmosphere interface of aquaculture shrimp ponds in two subtropical estuaries: The effect of temperature, substrate, salinity and nitrate	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												While aquaculture pond is a dominant land use/cover type and a distinct aquatic ecosystem in the coastal zones of China and southeast Asia, their contributions to the fluxes of greenhouse gases (GHGs) have only been poorly quantified. Fluxes of CO2 and CH4 in the shrimp ponds with different salinities were simultaneously measured in situ using the floating chamber technique in two different subtropical estuaries, namely, the Min River Estuary (MRE) and Jiulong River Estuary (JRE). The average CO2 and CH4 fluxes in the shrimp ponds over the observation periods varied from-2.09 to 3.37 mmol CO2 m(-2) h(-1) and from 0.28 to 16.28 mmol CH4 m(-2) h(-1), respectively, with higher fluxes being detected during the middle stage of aquaculture. The temporal variation of CO2 and CH4 fluxes in both estuaries ponds closely followed the seasonal cycle of temperature. Higher CH4 emissions were observed in MRE ponds than in JRE ponds because of the lower water salinity and N-NO3- concentrations as well as a greater supply of carbon substrates. Our findings suggested that shrimp ponds were CH4 emission "hotspots" in the subtropical estuaries of China. Based on a new global warming potential model, we conservatively estimated an anuual GHG emission rate of approximately 63.68 Tg CO2-eq during the culture period from aquaculture ponds across the subtropical estuaries of China. Our results demonstrate the importance of aquaculture ponds as a major GHG source and a contributor to climate warming in the subtropical estuarine regions of China, and call for effective regulation of GHG emissions from these ponds for climate mitigation in future.

Nitrification and ammonium dynamics in Taihu Lake, China: seasonal competition for ammonium between nitrifiers and cyanobacteria	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Taihu Lake is hypereutrophic and experiences seasonal, cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms. These Microcystis blooms produce microcystin, a potent liver toxin, and are linked to anthropogenic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loads to lakes. Microcystis spp. cannot fix atmospheric N and must compete with ammonia-oxidizing and other organisms for ammonium (NH4+). We measured NH4+ regeneration and potential uptake rates and total nitrification using stable-isotope techniques. Nitrification studies included abundance of the functional gene for NH4+ 4 oxidation, amoA, for ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB). Potential NH4+ uptake rates ranged from 0.02 to 6.80 mu mol L-1 h(-1) in the light and from 0.05 to 3.33 mu mol L-1 h(-1) in the dark, and NH4+ 4 regeneration rates ranged from 0.03 to 2.37 mu mol L-1 h(-1). Nitrification rates exceeded previously reported rates in most freshwater systems. Total nitrification often exceeded 200 nmol L-1 d(-1) and was > 1000 nmol L-1 d(-1) at one station near a river discharge. AOA amoA gene copies were more abundant than AOB gene copies (p < 0.005) at all times; however, only abundance of AOB amoA (not AOA) was correlated with nitrification rates for all stations and all seasons (p < 0.005). Nitrification rates in Taihu Lake varied seasonally; at most stations, rates were highest in March, lower in June, and lowest in July, corresponding with cyanobacterial bloom progression, suggesting that nitrifiers were poor competitors for NH4+ during the bloom. Regeneration results suggested that cyanobacteria relied extensively on regenerated NH4+ to sustain the bloom. Internal NH4+ regeneration exceeded external N loading to the lake by a factor of 2 but was ultimately fueled by external N loads. Our results thus support the growing literature calling for watershed N loading reductions in concert with existing management of P loads.

J	Han, QQ; Niu, ZG				Han, Qianqian; Niu, Zhenguo			Construction of the Long-Term Global Surface Water Extent Dataset Based on Water-NDVI Spatio-Temporal Parameter Set	REMOTE SENSING												Inland surface water is highly dynamic, seasonally and inter-annually, limiting the representativity of the water coverage information that is usually obtained at any single date. The long-term dynamic water extent products with high spatial and temporal resolution are particularly important to analyze the surface water change but unavailable up to now. In this paper, we construct a global water Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) spatio-temporal parameter set based on the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI. Employing the Google Earth Engine, we construct a new Global Surface Water Extent Dataset (GSWED) with coverage from 2000 to 2018, having an eight-day temporal resolution and a spatial resolution of 250 m. The results show that: (1) the MODIS NDVI-based surface water mapping has better performance compared to other water extraction methods, such as the normalized difference water index, the modified normalized difference water index, and the OTSU (maximal between-cluster variance method). In addition, the water-NDVI spatio-temporal parameter set can be used to update surface water extent datasets after 2018 as soon as the MODIS data are updated. (2) We validated the GSWED using random water samples from the Global Surface Water (GSW) dataset and achieved an overall accuracy of 96% with a kappa coefficient of 0.9. The producer's accuracy and user's accuracy were 97% and 90%, respectively. The validated comparisons in four regions (Qinghai Lake, Selin Co Lake, Utah Lake, and Dead Sea) show a good consistency with a correlation value of above 0.9. (3) The maximum global water area reached 2.41 million km(2)between 2000 and 2018, and the global water showed a decreasing trend with a significance of P = 0.0898. (4) Analysis of different types of water area change regions (Selin Co Lake, Urmia Lake, Aral Sea, Chiquita Lake, and Dongting Lake) showed that the GSWED can not only identify the seasonal changes of the surface water area and abrupt changes of hydrological events but also reflect the long-term trend of the water changes. In addition, GSWED has better performance in wetland areas and shallow areas. The GSWED can be used for regional studies and global studies of hydrology, biogeochemistry, and climate models.

Lake Erie fish safe to eat yet afflicted by algal hepatotoxins	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Toxic harmful algal blooms (HABs) pose serious threats to human health and instances of wildlife death have been documented across taxa. However, the extent of toxicological impacts on wildlife species is largely unresolved, raising uncertainty about the repercussions of increasingly severe HABs on the biodiversity and functioning of aquatic ecosystems. Here, we conducted a field study to assess human health risks from consuming fish caught across all stages of a HAB and to determine the pervasiveness of potentially harmful levels of the cosmopolitan toxin microcystin on fish populations. We collected 190 fish in 2015 and 2017 from Lake Erie, a large freshwater ecosystem that is highly productive for fisheries and is an epicenter of HABs and microcystin toxicity events. Fish muscles and livers were analyzed for total microcystins, which was used to conduct a human health risk assessment for comparison against fish consumption advisory benchmarks available for Lake Erie. We found microcystins pose low risks to human health from fillet consumption (mean 1.80 ng g-1 ww) but substantial risks to fish health and recruitment from liver concentrations measured well before and after seasonal bloom events (mean 460.13 ng g-1 ww). Our findings indicate HABs are a previously underappreciated but pervasive threat to fish populations.

InSAR deformation monitoring and prediction can investigate the freeze-thaw cycles of permafrost on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. However, the convolutional and recurrent neural net-works cannot accurately model long-term and complex relations in multivariate time series data, it is challenging to implement time series deformation prediction with high spatial resolution. In this paper, an innovative InSAR defor-mation prediction integrated algorithm based on the transformer models is proposed to predict time series deforma-tion more accurately surrounding Salt Lake. Compared with the other solutions, the unique feature of the proposed method is that: 1) this method takes advantage of the self-attention mechanism to study complicated dynamic defor-mation features of permafrost caused by temperature and other variables from InSAR time series deformation. 2) The transformer-based model can more accurately simulate seasonal and non-seasonal deformation signals, and is effective for short-term prediction of surface deformation in permafrost areas. The InSAR deformation prediction results dem-onstrate that the InSAR deformation prediction method achieves better prediction performance in predicting the de-formation trends of permafrost with a point scale compared with the prediction results of other models. Based on the predicted deformation and the water extraction results, the expansion trends surrounding Salt Lake are discussed and evaluated. The total area of Salt Lake increased by 57.32 km2 during the period 2015-2019. And Salt Lake maintained slowing expansion trend from 2019 to 2022. The time series deformation forecasting method can be used as a generic framework for modeling nonlinear deformation processes in complex permafrost areas, and it reveals the potential impact of the Salt Lake outburst event on the deformation processes and the degradation of permafrost.					; zhang, zhengjia/GWA-0586-2022; Wang, Chao/E-1599-2016; Huang, Zhihua/LRC-4904-2024	wang, jing/0000-0003-0411-0971; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				FEB 1	2023	858		2						159744	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159744	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159744		NOV 2022						36328256					WOS:000898823800008

Intermittently Closed/Open Lakes and Lagoons: Their global distribution and boundary conditions	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Intermittently Closed/Open Lakes and Lagoons (ICOLLs) are a particularly dynamic form of estuary characterised by periodic entrance closure to the ocean. Closure occurs when a subaerial sand berm stabilises across the entrance channel during times of low fluvial discharge. ICOLLs are of global importance as they provide valuable ecological habitats for many species and are associated with a wide range of management issues due to their cycle of entrance closure and opening. ICOLLs are found to be more widespread globally than previously described with 1477 of these estuaries being identified in this study. This constitutes an estimated 3% of the world's estuaries and 15% of all estuaries along microtidal coastlines. ICOLLs are concentrated along microtidal to low mesotidal coastlines in the mid-latitudes and predominantly on coasts with temperate climates. This distribution is related to greater wave heights as driven by high intensity winds and a longer fetch distance. The highest proportion of ICOLLs are present in Australia (21% all global ICOLLs), South Africa (16%) and Mexico (16%). In Australia, a comparison with fluvial input found that it is less important than marine processes in determining ICOLL formation and that ICOLLs are associated with a relative tidal range of < 3.22. Additionally the majority of ICOLLS are small systems with catchments < 2000 km(2) and tidal prisms < 30 x 10(6) m(3), forming at the mouths of rivers with generally low mean annual and specific discharges.					; Kennedy, Martin/O-4540-2019; Stout, Justin/G-8853-2013	KENNEDY, DAVID/0000-0002-4878-7717; McSweeney, Sarah/0000-0003-0442-7426; Stout, Justin/0000-0001-5540-4000													0169-555X	1872-695X				SEP 1	2017	292						142	152		10.1016/j.geomorph.2017.04.022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2017.04.022													WOS:000405153300012

Under the influence of human activities and climate variability, the water level during the middle of dry season (MDS) had a significant tendency to increase in Poyang Lake (PYL) and Dongting Lake (DTL), which directly affected the habitat suitability (HS) of migratory birds and threatened their existence. Based on the data of HS and weight of migratory birds, four evaluation indexes, namely, the accuracy of priority identification (API), geographical area equalization (GAE), the spatial autocorrelation consistency (SAC) and comprehensive evaluation index (CEI), were used to evaluate and compare the priorities identification effects of four classification methods, namely, natural breaks method, quantile method, equal interval method, and geometric interval method. The results showed that the geometric interval method and the quantile method are the best methods to identify the priority of habitat restoration of migratory birds in PYL and DTL wetlands, respectively, under the condition of increased water level (IWL) during the MDS. The method of priority identification proposed in this study and its results can provide a scientific basis for the regulation of wetland resources and the conservation of biodiversity (especially migratory birds).					liu, yuanyuan/ABE-6458-2021; Wu, Haipeng/O-2852-2015; Cai, Xiaoxi/KFR-0602-2024	Wu, Haipeng/0000-0002-9888-6959; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				JUL	2023	151								110322	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110322	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110322		MAY 2023											WOS:001004397800001

Microbiotas in sediment can be used as the effective indicators of heavy metals. The goal of this study was to understand the bacterial communities responding to heavy metal enrichment in sediments and prioritize some factors that affected significantly to bacterial community. Sediments were sampled from five river-lake systems in the Poyang Lake in dry season, and the bacterial community was analyzed using Illumina high-throughput sequencing. Relationships between sediment environment and the diversity and structure of bacterial communities were determined by correlation analysis and redundancy analysis (RDA). The result indicated that Cd and Sb were identified as the heavy metals of the great risk in sediments. Sediments from five river-lake systems shared 31.83% core operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of bacterial communities. Proteobacteria (33.54% of total sequences) and Actinobacteria (15.04%) were the dominant phyla across all sites. High enrichment of heavy metals (MRI and mC(d)) resulted in low diversity of bacterial communities (Simpson index). The RDA revealed pH, OC, mCd, and Efs of As, Pb, Cd were major factors related to bacterial community structure changes. The dominant phylum Actinobacteria was regarded as tolerant bacteria, while the dominant phylum Proteobacteria was named as resistant bacteria in sediment with high anthropogenic Cd enrichment.					zhang, huamin/HWQ-3998-2023; Feng, XX/GZL-4567-2022														0147-6513	1090-2414				DEC 15	2018	165						314	324		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.09.010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.09.010								30212732					WOS:000447484000038

To date, studies on the joint observations of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in inland lakes from multiple missions have been poorly reported. Here, we generated a harmonized Chl-a dataset for the lakes in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau in China from 2013 to 2022 by the Landsat 8/9 (L8/L9) and Sentinel-2A/B (S2A/S2B) virtual constellation. This study first examined the performance of four atmospheric correction processors to derive the remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) from L8/L9 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and S2A/S2B multispectral instrument (MSI) images. We determined that the dark spectral fitting algorithm generated better R-rs than the other processors, e.g., R-rs(561) mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) = 15.2%, R-rs(665) MAPE = 27.5%, and R-rs(704) MAPE = 25.7%. OLI-derived R-rs at five visible and near-infrared bands showed satisfactory agreement with MSI (slope = 0.94 and MAPE = 11.8%). The mixed density network outperformed the six state-of-the-art algorithms and other two machine learning models in retrieving Chl-a [MSI: MAPE = 31.4% (N = 109) and OLI: MAPE = 38.0% (N = 74)]. The satisfactory agreement of Chl-a retrievals between the synchronous MSI and OLI images (N = 2 293 821 and MAPE = 34.6%) supported the establishment of the virtual constellation. MSI- and OLI-derived Chl-a in nine major lakes in the studied area exhibited apparent seasonal variability from 2013 to 2022, particularly after 2017. Results highlight a solution to establish the Landsat/Sentinel-2 virtual constellation for improving the spatial and temporal resolutions of a database of lake water quality.					liu, miao/KGL-7043-2024; Cao, Zhigang/L-5336-2017; Cao, Zhigang/L-5337-2017; Duan, Hongtao/B-7210-2011; ma, rong/GVU-3096-2022	Cao, Zhigang/0000-0001-5329-2906; Xue, Kun/0000-0003-3413-0770; Liu, Miao/0000-0002-3888-1849; Duan, Hongtao/0000-0002-1985-2292; Ma, Ronghua/0000-0002-4485-4636													0196-2892	1558-0644					2022	60								4209916	10.1109/TGRS.2022.3207345	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2022.3207345													WOS:000864196200008

PPCPs were ubiquitous in aqueous phase and sediments from Dianshan Lake. Sulfamethazine (SMZ) was dominated in surface water and overlying water, while ketoprofen (KPF) was rich in sediment. The total concentration of PPCPs ranged from 0.38-85.27 ng/L, 24.26-130.03 ng/L and 5.39-149.84 mu g/kg in surface water, overlying water and sediment, respectively, which were in middle levels compared with these reported in other aquatic environment in China. Naproxen (NPX), sulfadimethoxine (SDM), sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and sulfamethazine (SMZ) in surface water showed a relatively higher level in lake side than those in lake center suggesting that a mixed containment source of human- and animal-derived from the areas around lake. The significant season variations of most PPCPs were mainly attributed to their usage, water temperature and dilution effect. The partition behaviors of PPCPs in sediment-overlying water and sediment-pore water system were mainly affected by their logK(ow) values, and showed weak correlation with total organic carbon (TOC) content in sediment and molecular weights of PPCPs. Preliminary results indicated that PPCPs in Dianshan Lake have not posed a high risk to human health by exposure to drinking water for all age groups. Nevertheless, their potential to cause the mixture toxicity and resistance genes cannot be neglected. This work will contribute to the clear picture of PPCPs contamination in drinking water source in the Demonstration Zone, and provide reliable and simple-to-use information to regulators on the exposure and risk levels of PPCPs, as well as recommendations for future research.

Our objectives were to analyze temperature, precipitation, and flood patterns, assess their effects on building material costs, and examine subsequent LULC changes through Remote Sensing and GIS techniques. Using MODIS satellite imagery and meteorological data, we found significant correlations between climatic variables and construction costs, with temperatures ranging from 15 degrees C to 38 degrees C and monthly rainfall peaking at 611mm in 2011. Climate Impact Assessment revealed that extreme weather events, particularly flooding affecting 30,633 km degrees in 2013, substantially influenced building material durability and costs. Resource availability analysis showed that rangeland area decreased from 30,522 km degrees to 25,435 km degrees, affecting local construction material sourcing. Water discharge data demonstrated seasonal variations correlating with flooding events, with peak discharge reaching 16,844 m'/s, directly impacting construction site accessibility and material transportation costs. The study found that flood-prone areas experienced up to 25% higher construction costs due to necessary flood-resistant materials and design modifications. These findings highlight the critical relationship between climatic factors, resource availability, and hospital construction costs, providing valuable insights for construction planners and healthcare facility managers to develop cost-effective and climate-resilient building strategies.

J	Amiri, V; Berndtsson, R				Amiri, Vahab; Berndtsson, Ronny			Fluoride occurrence and human health risk from groundwater use at the west coast of Urmia Lake, Iran	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												We investigated fluoride (F-) concentration and physicochemical features of groundwater in the Urmia coastal aquifer (northwest, Iran). Groundwater samples were collected during both dry (58 wells) and wet seasons (84 wells). Approximately 15 and 23% of the groundwater samples in the dry and wet seasons, respectively, exceeded the recommended F(-)value by WHO for drinking water (1.5 mg/L). High F(-)concentration in groundwater is mainly found in shallow wells. The cause of high F(-)concentration appears to be mainly caused by human activities. Agricultural fertilizers and industrial waste can result in rapid release of F(-)into the groundwater. Release of F(-)into the groundwater can, however, also be triggered by the interaction between rock and water. In the experimental area, high F(-)concentrations were found close to volcanic rocks. Health risks from exposure to F(-)in groundwater were analyzed for adults and children. Utilizing sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulation, the uncertainties in the risk estimates were calculated. Sensitivity analyses showed that the most pertinent variables are F(-)concentration in drinking water, averaging time, exposure time, and ingestion rate of water. Children are more susceptible to the noncarcinogenic risk of F(-)in groundwater.					; Amiri, Vahab/AAW-1555-2021; Berndtsson, Ronny/C-7449-2015	Berndtsson, Ronny/0000-0003-1473-0138; Amiri, Vahab/0000-0001-9734-9812													1866-7511	1866-7538				SEP 8	2020	13	18							921	10.1007/s12517-020-05905-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12517-020-05905-7													WOS:000570961400001

However, there is a lack of CH4 flux and ebullitive (bubble) emission data from urban rivers, which might lead to large underestimations of global aquatic CH4 emissions. Here, we conducted high-frequency surveys using the boundary layer model (BLM) supplemented with floating chambers (FCs) and bubble traps to investigate the seasonal and diurnal variability in CH4 emissions in a eutrophic urban river and to evaluate whether the contribution of bubbles is important. We found that ebullition contributed nearly 99% of CH4 emissions and varied on hourly to seasonal time scales, ranging from 0.83 to 230 mmol m(-2) d(-1), although diffusive emissions and CH4 concentrations in bubbles did not exhibit temporal variability. Ebullitive CH4 emissions presented high temperature sensitivity (r = 0.6 and p < 0.01) in this urban river, and eutrophication might have triggered this high temperature sensitivity. The ebullitive CH4 flux is more likely to be underestimated at low temperatures because capturing the bubble flux is more difficult, given the low frequency of ebullition events. This study suggests that future ebullition measurements on longer time scales are needed to accurately quantify the CH4 budgets of eutrophic urban rivers.					; wang, shuxiao/H-5990-2011; Wang, Dongqi/D-7754-2013; Cai, Rui/GRO-1869-2022	Chen, Shu/0000-0001-9656-5249; wang, shuxiao/0000-0001-9727-1963; Wang, Dongqi/0000-0002-7850-3834; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				JUN 1	2021	55	11					7287	7298		10.1021/acs.est.1c00114	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c00114		MAY 2021						34003644					WOS:000659374200010
J	GERLACH, TM				GERLACH, TM			OXYGEN BUFFERING OF KILAUEA VOLCANIC GASES AND THE OXYGEN FUGACITY OF KILAUEA BASALT	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Volcanic gases collected during episode 1 of the Puu Oo eruption along the east rift zone of Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii, have uniform C-O-H-S-Cl-F compositions that are sharply depleted in CO2. The CO2-poor gases are typical of Type II volcanic gases (GERLACH and GRAEBER, 1985) and were emitted from evolved magma stored for a prolonged period of time in the east rift zone after releasing CO2-rich gases during an earlier period of temporary residence in the summit magma chamber. The samples are remarkably free of contamination by atmospheric gases and meteoric water. Thermodynamic evaluation of the analytical data shows that the episode 1 gases have equilibrium compositions appropriate for temperatures between 935 and 1032-degrees-C. Open- and closed-system equilibrium models of species distributions for the episode 1 gases show unequivocally that coexisting lavas buffered the gas oxygen fugacities during cooling. These models indicate that the f(O2) buffering process occurs by transfer of oxygen from the major species in the gas phase (H2O, CO2, SO2) to the lava during cooling and that the transfer of oxygen also controls the fugacities of several minor and trace species (H-2, CO, H2S, S2, Cl2, F2), in addition to O2 during cooling. Gas/lava exchanges of other components are apparently insignificant and exert little influence, compared to oxygen exchange, during cooling. Oxygen transfer during cooling is variable, presumably reflecting short-term fluctuations in gas flow rates. Higher flow rates restrict the time available for gas/lava oxygen transfer and result in gases with higher equilibrium temperatures. Lower flow rates favor f(O2)-constrained equilibration by oxygen transfer down to lower temperatures. Thus, the chemical equilibrium preserved in these gases is a heterogeneous equilibrium constrained by oxygen fugacity, and the equilibrium temperatures implied by the compositions of the gases reflect the temperatures at which gas/lava oxygen exchange ceased. This conclusion challenges the common assumption that volcanic gases are released from lava in a state of chemical equilibrium and then continue equilibrating homogeneously with falling temperature until reaction rates are unable to keep pace with cooling. No evidence is found, moreover, that certain gas species are kinetically more responsive and able to equilibrate down to lower temperatures than those of the last gas/lava oxygen exchange. Homogeneous reaction rates in the gas phase are apparently slow compared to the time it took for the gases to move from the last site of gas/lava equilibration to the site of collection. An earlier set of data for higher temperature CO2-rich Type I volcanic gases, which come from sustained summit lava lake eruptions supplied by magma that experienced substantially shorter periods of crustal storage, shows f(O2) buffering by oxygen transfer up to 1185-degrees-C. Oxygen fugacity measurements in drill holes into ponded lava flows suggest that buffering by oxygen transfer may control the f(O2) of residual gases down to several hundred degrees below the solidus in the early stages of cooling. Although the details of the f(O2) buffering mechanisms for oxygen transfer are unknown, the fact that f(O2) buffering is effective from molten to subsolidus conditions suggests that the reaction mechanisms must change with cooling as the reactants change from predominantly melt, to melt plus crystals, to glass plus crystals. Mass balance calculations suggest that redox reactions between the gas and ferrous/ferric iron in the lava are plausible mechanisms for the oxygen transfer and that the f(O2) of the gases is buffered by sliding ferrous/ferric equilibria in the erupting lavas. Contrary to expectations based on models predicting the oxidation of basalt by H-2 and CO escape during crustal storage, CO2-rich Type I gases and CO2-poor Type II gases have identical oxygen fugacities despite greatly different crustal storage and degassing histories. Volcanic gas data give a tightly constrained log f(O2) of NNO - 0.5 (+/-0.05) for subaerially erupted Kilauea basalt from liquidus to solidus temperatures, consistent with recent f(O2) determinations for the mantle source regions of ocean island basalts. Because the oxygen fugacities of volcanic gases emitted by subaerial lavas imply that the f(O2) of Kilauea basalt is unchanged during crustal storage, Kilauea basalt either arrives in the crust with an oxygen fugacity between NNO and FMQ, or it develops an oxygen fugacity in this range immediately upon arrival in the summit chamber.																			0016-7037					FEB	1993	57	4					795	814		10.1016/0016-7037(93)90169-W	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(93)90169-W													WOS:A1993KN41200006

The concentrations of the studied heavy metals, except Pb in Corica soborna, were found to be below the safe limits suggested by various authorities and thus gave no indication of pollution. The present study also showed that, Zn was the most and Cd was the least accumulated metal in the studied fish muscles. ANOVA analysis clearly revealed that there was a significant variation (Cl = 95%) of the heavy metal concentrations in different fish species in the Bangshi River. Significant positive correlations between the heavy metal concentrations in fish muscles were also observed in both seasons. From the human health point of view, this study showed that there was no possible health risk to consumers due to intake of studied fishes under the current consumption rate.

Metagenome-assembled genomes uncover a global brackish microbiome	GENOME BIOLOGY												Background: Microbes are main drivers of biogeochemical cycles in oceans and lakes. Although the genome is a foundation for understanding the metabolism, ecology and evolution of an organism, few bacterioplankton genomes have been sequenced, partly due to difficulties in cultivating them. Results: We use automatic binning to reconstruct a large number of bacterioplankton genomes from a metagenomic time-series from the Baltic Sea, one of world's largest brackish water bodies. These genomes represent novel species within typical freshwater and marine clades, including clades not previously sequenced. The genomes' seasonal dynamics follow phylogenetic patterns, but with fine-grained lineage-specific variations, reflected in gene-content. Signs of streamlining are evident in most genomes, and estimated genome sizes correlate with abundance variation across filter size fractions. Comparing the genomes with globally distributed metagenomes reveals significant fragment recruitment at high sequence identity from brackish waters in North America, but little from lakes or oceans. This suggests the existence of a global brackish metacommunity whose populations diverged from freshwater and marine relatives over 100,000 years ago, long before the Baltic Sea was formed (8000 years ago). This markedly contrasts to most Baltic Sea multicellular organisms, which are locally adapted populations of freshwater or marine counterparts. Conclusions: We describe the gene content, temporal dynamics and biogeography of a large set of new bacterioplankton genomes assembled from metagenomes. We propose that brackish environments exert such strong selection that lineages adapted to them flourish globally with limited influence from surrounding aquatic communities.

J	Kim, KB; Jung, MK; Tsang, YF; Kwon, HH				Kim, Kue Bum; Jung, Min-Kyu; Tsang, Yiu Fai; Kwon, Hyun-Han			Stochastic modeling of chlorophyll-a for probabilistic assessment and monitoring of algae blooms in the Lower Nakdong River, South Korea	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												Eutrophication is one of the critical water quality issues in the world nowadays. Various studies have been conducted to explore the contributing factors related to eutrophication symptoms. However, in the field of eutrophication modeling, the stochastic nature associated with the eutrophication process has not been sufficiently explored, especially in a multivariate stochastic modeling framework. In this study, a multivariate hidden Markov model (MHMM) that can consider the spatio-temporal dependence in chlorophyll-a concentration over the Nakdong River of South Korea was proposed. The MHMM can effectively cluster the intra-seasonal and inter annual variability of chlorophyll-a, thereby enabling us to understand the spatio-temporal evolutions of algal blooms. The relationships between hydro-climatic conditions (e.g., temperature and river flow) and chlorophyll a concentrations were evident, whereas a relatively weak relationship with water quality parameters was observed. The MHMM enables us to effectively infer the conditional probability of the eutrophication state for the following month. The self-transition likelihood of staying in the current state is substantially higher than the likelihood of moving to other states. Moreover, the proposed modeling approach can effectively offer a probabilistic decision-support framework for constructing an alert classification of the eutrophication. The potential use of the proposed modeling framework was also provided.

Dongting Lake is a typical seasonal lake in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and its hydrological conditions have changed significantly due to the con-struction of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD). However, there are knowledge gaps in the responses of wetland vegetation dynamics to the changes of hydrological conditions, especially in cloudy and rainy regions, where continuous large-scale monitoring is still challenging. In this study, by using time series of Landsat data on Google Earth Engine, a long-term cloudless remote sensing images dataset of Dongting Lake during the dry season was constructed. The multi-year wetland vegetation from 2003 to 2020 was mapped using the random forest model. Relationships between wetland vegetation dynamics and hydrological conditions (e.g., water level and inundation character) were examined using correlation and linear analysis. Results revealed that wetland vegetation in the Dongting Lake experienced significant inter-annual spatial heterogeneity and temporal dy-namic equilibrium with a slight increase during the post-TGD period. Only Carex communities at elevations above 28 m and below 26 m displayed apparent changes. Reed communities have relatively high selectivity to inundation frequency, and are affected mainly by changes in water levels during the dry season of the current year. Hydrological conditions during the rising period have an important impact on the first growth and reproduction stage of Carex, while higher water levels or more rapid surface submergence lead to a decrease in seed density in the soil of low-elevation floodplains. This study deepens our knowledge of changes of wetland vegetation and their response to hydrological conditions, and is of great significance to the ecological protection and restoration of Dongting Lake.					shi, qian/KIG-9601-2024; peng, huanhua/GWZ-1376-2022	Peng, huanhua/0000-0003-1052-8557; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				SEP	2022	142								109283	10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109283	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109283		AUG 2022											WOS:000861981100001

The average microplastic abundances in the river waters and sediments are 5358-654000 n/m(3) and 43.57-615 items/kg, respectively, and there are fewer microplastics in water samples than in sediments. Microplastics in the study area can be divided into five types according to their occurrence morphologies, namely fragments, foams, films, fibers, and particles. The most widely distributed pollution types in sediments include debris, fibers, and particles. In contrast, fibers are the dominant type in water samples, accounting for 68.18%-98.93%. The chemical components of the microplastics include polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate, and polyvinyl chloride. The microplastics are in four colors, with white accounting for a higher proportion. The grain size of the microplastics in tributaries or lakes of the Yellow River is less than 2 mm, which makes them liable to enter organisms for enrichment. Furthermore, the sources of the microplastics are closely related to agricultural and industrial production and biological activities in habitats and exhibit seasonal and hydrological characteristics. The microplastics in the study area show the adsorption of metals and nonmetals to different degrees, which increases the pollution risks of heavy metals combined with microplastics. In addition, microplastics can accumulate in organisms in the Yellow River and cause physical, biochemical, and other damage to aquatic organisms, thus further posing carcinogenic risks to human beings. Therefore, it is necessary to study, monitor, and control the pollution and effects of microplastics in the Yellow River, in order to provide theoretical references for the control of pollution and ecological risk of microplastics in the river.

However, few studies have been conducted in a large fresh water lake basin to research the influence of industrial and agricultural activities on lake eutrophication through a systematic hydrogeochemical perspective. In this study, 36 samplings were collected in dry and wet season from 2017 to 2018 in China's largest fresh water lake (Poyang Lake). Hydrogeochemical methods (comprehensive trophic level index, entropy-weighted water quality index, ion ratio coefficient, land use/cover change analysis) and hydrogeochemical reverse simulation were used to investigate the anthropogenic causes of lake eutrophication. The results showed that the trophic level index of Poyang Lake increased from 46.08 to 56.38 and achieved the light eutropher level. Ion ratio coefficient analysis revealed the influence of industrial sewage, manure input and agricultural input on the lake. Reverse simulation results showed the urea increased 5.244e-5 mmol/l and the calcium superphosphate decreased 1.554e-8 mmol/l in dry season. While the urea decreased 3.719e-5 mmol/l and the calcium super-phosphate decreased 5.381e-7 mmol/l in wet season. Additionally, the cultivated land and construction land area increased 74.4 km2 and 46.31 km2 from 2017 to 2018, which aggravated the eutrophication. TN/TP also affected water quality in Poyang Lake. These results will be helpful to reveal the anthropogenic influence on eutrophi-cation in large fresh water lakes so that put forward targeted treatment measures.

The reconstruction of long-term hypolimnetic anoxia records can be challenging due to lack of valid and easily measurable proxies. The sedimentary Mn/Fe ratio measured by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is often used as a proxy for past lake redox conditions. Yet the interpretation of this ratio can be problematic when Fe and Mn accumulation is not solely redox driven. We used the varved sediments of Lake Moossee (Switzerland) to examine the partitioning of Fe and Mn in seven fractions by sequential extraction under various oxygen conditions over the last 15,000 years. We combined this data with XRF scans and an independent diagnostic proxy for anoxia given by a hyperspectral imaging (HSI)-inferred record of bacteriopheophytin, to validate the use of the XRF-Mn/Fe ratio as redox proxy. In the 15,000-year long record, Fe was bound to humins and amorphous, crystalline, sulfide and residual forms. Mn was mainly present in carbonate and amorphous forms. Higher erosion, prolonged anoxia, diagenesis and humic matter input affected Fe and Mn accumulation. Under holomixis the XRF-Mn/Fe ratio successfully reflected lake redox conditions. Periods with higher detrital Fe input obscured the applicability of the ratio. During phases of permanent anoxia, intensified early diagenetic processes trapped Mn in the sediments in carbonate, crystalline oxide and humic forms. Our study shows that the single use of the XRF-Mn/Fe ratio is often not conclusive for inferring past lake redox conditions. The application of the XRF-Mn/Fe as a proxy for anoxia requires taking into account the individual lake characteristics and changes in lake environmental conditions, which affect the accumulation of Fe and Mn in the sediments.

Histopathological evaluation of bivalves from the southwest coast of India as an indicator of environmental quality	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Bivalve molluscs have been regarded as excellent bioindicators of environmental pollution as they persistently accumulate toxic contaminants present in their ecosystem. Histological alterations in the digestive gland and gills of three bivalve sp., Viz. edible oyster (Magallana bilineata), green mussel (Perna viridis) and black clam (Villorita cyprinoides) from ecologically sensitive regions of international significance on the southwest coast of India were evaluated using a semi-quantitative histopathological index to assess the environmental quality. The prominent tissue alterations included tubular vacuolation, haemocytic infiltration, parasitosis, lamellar disorganization, and the presence of prokaryotic inclusions. The presence of ten trace metals was also evaluated in the digestive gland of bivalves. The histopathological indices were evaluated season-wise and region-wise. Seasonal variation in all the reaction patterns was observed in the digestive gland across sampling zones, with the highest indices observed during post-monsoon. The indices for all the reaction patterns in the digestive gland were significantly higher in bivalves from Vembanad Lake (Z4), followed by Periyar River (Z5). The indices for cellular changes and parasitosis in gills were the highest in the Ashtamudi estuary (Z1) and Z5, respectively. The global histopathological indices of the digestive gland and gills were also the highest in Z4, followed by Z5. Principal component analysis revealed that Z4 was distinct with the highest metal pollution index. A positive relation was observed with heavy metals, digestive gland histological alterations, and season and region of sampling.

The New Zealand mud snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum): autecology and management of a global invader	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The New Zealand mud snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum; NZMS) is among the most globally widespread aquatic invaders, occurring in 39 countries and 5 continents. Herein we provide a systematic review of 245 articles, focusing on the ecological impacts, spatial distribution, population dynamics, vectors of spread, and management of invasive NZMS. Most NZMS introductions originate from already-established invasive populations, which represent a small number of clonal lineages. The invasion success of NZMS stems from opportunistic traits, and while their tolerance of broad ranges of environmental conditions facilitates spread, optimal conditions for successful NZMS establishment are evident: stable hydrology, slow water velocity, high specific conductivity, and moderate salinity. NZMS can become exceptionally abundant, driving the greatest secondary-production rates reported for any stream invertebrate. However, NZMS populations fluctuate seasonally and over longer time scales, with marked declines observed after population booms. Minimal genetic variation within and among invasive populations and minimal incidences of predation/parasitism suggest that environmental factors constrain populations. As detritivore-herbivores, NZMS impact multiple compartments of aquatic ecosystems and their functioning. NZMS alter invertebrate and algal communities and can resist digestion by many fish species, reducing fish condition. This lack of digestion combined with expanding NZMS populations suggest that snail-eating fish are unlikely to regulate NZMS populations and may aid in local range expansion. Management programs and technologies have recently emerged to assist resource managers, including advances in environmental DNA detection methods and effective chemical decontamination treatments. The objective of this review is to contribute to a more robust understanding of the global NZMS invasion, such that undesired impacts can be minimized or averted.					tiegs, scott/JXM-6032-2024; Mancuso, Jasmine/JXL-4861-2024; Strayer, David/H-3788-2011	Geist, Jeremy/0000-0002-7964-8410; Bovee, Emily/0000-0001-9239-1923; 													1387-3547	1573-1464				APR	2022	24	4					905	938		10.1007/s10530-021-02681-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-021-02681-7		JAN 2022											WOS:000740150700001

Seasonal Dynamics of Organic Matter Composition and Its Effects on Suspended Sediment Flocculation in River Water	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Organic matter (OM) and suspended sediment are abundant, and interact with each other, in rivers and lakes. OM is usually adsorbed by suspended sediment and causes either particle stabilization or flocculation. In this study, the OM composition and suspended sediment flocculation potential of river water were regularly measured throughout the year 2016. The OM composition of the river water samples was measured with a liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection system and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy, and the flocculation potential was measured in a standard jar test experiment. Results from the OM analyses and flocculation potential tests, in association with a multivariate data analysis, demonstrated that the OM composition and flocculation potential of the river water were dynamic under different meteorological, hydrological, ecological, and anthropogenic conditions and closely correlated with each other. Dry seasons with low rainfall and water discharge induced a lacustrine condition and led to the OM composition being more aquagenic and flocculation-favorable. The most favorable condition for the enhancement of flocculation was during algae bloom and associated with the production of biopolymers from algae. In contrast, rainy seasons were advantageous for stabilization of suspended sediment because of excessive transport of terrigenous humic substances from catchment areas into the river. Such terrigenous humic substances enhanced stabilization by creating enhanced electrostatic repulsion via adsorption onto the sediment surface. Findings from this research provide a better insight into the highly complex behaviors of and interactions between OM and suspended sediment in natural water environments.					; Toorman, Erik/C-2658-2014	Fettweis, Michael/0000-0001-8845-6464; Toorman, Erik/0000-0001-7647-6310													0043-1397	1944-7973				AUG	2019	55	8					6968	6985		10.1029/2018WR024486	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018WR024486													WOS:000490973700035

Effects of Increasing Nitrogen and Phosphorus Concentrations on Phytoplankton Community Growth and Toxicity During Planktothrix Blooms in Sandusky Bay, Lake Erie	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Sandusky Bay experiences annual toxic cyanobacterial blooms dominated by Planktothrix agardhii/suspensa. To further understand the environmental drivers of these events, we evaluated changes in the growth response and toxicity of the Planktothrix-dominated blooms to nutrient amendments with orthophosphate (PO4) and inorganic and organic forms of dissolved nitrogen (N; ammonium (NH4), nitrate (NO3) and urea) over the bloom season (June October). We complemented these with a metagenomic analysis of the planktonic microbial community. Our results showed that bloom growth and microcystin (MC) concentrations responded more frequently to additions of dissolved N than PO4, and that the dual addition of NH4 + PO4 and Urea + PO4 yielded the highest MC concentrations in 54% of experiments. Metagenomic analysis confirmed that P. agardhii/suspensa was the primary MC producer. The phylogenetic distribution of nifH revealed that both heterocystous cyanobacteria and heterotrophic proteobacteria had the genetic potential for N-2 fixation in Sandusky Bay. These results suggest that as best management practices are developed for P reductions in Sandusky Bay, managers must be aware of the negative implications of not managing N loading into this system as N may significantly impact cyanobacterial bloom size and toxicity.					; McKay, Robert/P-3759-2017; Bullerjahn, George/F-4428-2010	Bullerjahn, George/0000-0001-5319-7896; McKay, Robert/0000-0003-2723-5371; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				JUN 16	2015	49	12					7197	7207		10.1021/acs.est.5b00799	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.5b00799								25992592					WOS:000356755200013

In Antarctica, the distribution and temporal development of supraglacial lakes as well as their potential contribution to increased ice mass loss remains largely unknown, requiring a detailed mapping of the Antarctic surface hydrological network. In this study, we employ a Machine Learning algorithm trained on Sentinel-2 and auxiliary TanDEM-X topographic data for automated mapping of Antarctic supraglacial lakes. To ensure the spatio-temporal transferability of our method, a Random Forest was trained on 14 training regions and applied over eight spatially independent test regions distributed across the whole Antarctic continent. In addition, we employed our workflow for large-scale application over Amery Ice Shelf where we calculated interannual supraglacial lake dynamics between 2017 and 2020 at full ice shelf coverage. To validate our supraglacial lake detection algorithm, we randomly created point samples over our classification results and compared them to Sentinel-2 imagery. The point comparisons were evaluated using a confusion matrix for calculation of selected accuracy metrics. Our analysis revealed wide-spread supraglacial lake occurrence in all three Antarctic regions. For the first time, we identified supraglacial meltwater features on Abbott, Hull and Cosgrove Ice Shelves in West Antarctica as well as for the entire Amery Ice Shelf for years 2017-2020. Over Amery Ice Shelf, maximum lake extent varied strongly between the years with the 2019 melt season characterized by the largest areal coverage of supraglacial lakes (similar to 763 km(2)). The accuracy assessment over the test regions revealed an average Kappa coefficient of 0.86 where the largest value of Kappa reached 0.98 over George VI Ice Shelf. Future developments will involve the generation of circum-Antarctic supraglacial lake mapping products as well as their use for further methodological developments using Sentinel-1 SAR data in order to characterize intraannual supraglacial meltwater dynamics also during polar night and independent of meteorological conditions. In summary, the implementation of the Random Forest classifier enabled the development of the first automated mapping method applied to Sentinel-2 data distributed across all three Antarctic regions.

However, information about the profiles of functional genes and bacterial communities and the most important environmental factor affecting them in the sediments of eutrophic lake remains unrevealed. In this work, the real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay and 16S ribosomal RNA gene next generation sequencing analysis were used to explore the profiles of functional genes and bacterial communities in the sediments of Chaohu Lake. The selected 18 functional genes involved in C, N and P cycles were detected in most of samples. Seasonal variation and sediment variables were found to affect the profiles of functional genes and bacterial communities, and total nitrogen was the dominant environmental factor to drive the formation of bacterial community structure. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were observed to be the two dominant phyla in the sediments with relative abundance ranging from 10.8% to 36.0% and 7.7%-46.7%, respectively. Three bacterial phyla, i.e., Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Spirochaetes, were found to be significantly positively correlated with the C, N and P-cycle related functional genes. Bacterial community structure was the most important driver to shape the profiles of functional genes. Seasonal variation also influenced the co-occurrence patterns between functional genes and bacterial taxa as revealed by network analysis. The findings from this work facilitate a better understanding about the C, N, and P cycles in the sediments of eutrophic lakes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Interannual changes in lake area, along with seasonal change trends and influencing factors, were studied for the months of April, July and September. The results showed that the total lakes area differed according to interannual variations and was largest in April and smallest in September, measuring -684.9 km(2)/a, -870.6 km(2)/a and -827.5 km(2)/a for April, July and September, respectively. The change rates for the total area of alpine lakes during the same three months were 31.1 km(2)/a, 29.8 km(2)/a and 30.6 km(2)/a, respectively, while for lakes situated on plains, the change rates were -716.1 km(2)/a, -900.5 km(2)/a, and -858 km(2)/a, respectively. Overall, plains lakes showed a declining trend and alpine lakes showed an expanding trend, the latter likely due to the warmer and wetter climate. Furthermore, there was a high correlation (r = 0.92) between area changes rate of all alpine lakes and the lakes basin supply coefficient, although there was low correlation (r = 0.43) between area changes rate of all alpine lakes area and glacier area/lake area. This indicates that lakes recharge via precipitation may be greater than lakes recharge via glacier meltwater. The shrinking of area changes for all plains lakes in the study region was attributable to climate change and human activities.

Water samples were collected once in July 2017 for analysis of nitrate concentration and isotopic composition. The overall values of delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- ranged from +1.8 parts per thousand to +23.0 parts per thousand, and from -6.3 parts per thousand to +222 parts per thousand respectively. Duel isotopic composition suggested that nitrification of soil organic nitrogen was the main source of nitrate in the Yalu Tsangpo River. Furthermore, anthropogenic nitrogen inputs become more important in downstream than upstream because of intensive agricultural activities and urban input. In the rivers of the Ngari District, nitrate is mainly derived from desert deposits, manure and sewage, and chemical fertilisers. Different rivers show different characteristics of nitrate sources depending on the location, topography, lanclform, and climate of the river basins. Animal manure, nitrification of soil organic matter, and desert deposits are mainly responsible for the shifting of nitrate isotopic signatures in lakes, which are minimally affected by human activities. In wetlands, biological nitrification and denitrification could be the main processes of nitrogen migration and transformation. These results provide useful information in revealing the fate of nitrate in different aquatic ecosystems and different areas of Tibet. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Currently large uncertainties still remain regarding the emission strength of this source type and its relationship with aquacultural farming practices. In this study, the methane flux was measured continuously for four years with eddy covariance (EC) in an aquaculture pond complex in the Yangtze River Delta, China. These ponds have never been dredged and were aerated during part of the aquacultural season. Additionally, floating chambers and inverted funnels were used to investigate spatial heterogeneity of the CH4 flux and to quantify the contribution via ebullition to the flux. The results showed that the daily CH4 flux ranged from 0.1 to 16.7 mu g m(-2) s(-1), with an average value of 4.10 +/- 3.08 mu g m(-2) s(-1). Water temperature was the primary driver of the CH4 flux across multiple time scales (half-hourly, daily, and monthly scale). Ebullition was the main transport way accounting for 70% +/- 4% of the total CH4 flux. The annual flux in this study was about three times the median flux reported by other researchers for similar freshwater aquaculture ponds. A statistical analysis of our data together with the published flux data reveals that ponds with dredging have much lower CH4 emission flux than those without dredging and suggests that dredging may have a much larger influence on the emission flux than aeration.					zhang, yuhang/ISS-5685-2023; Li, Xiaoyan/K-8544-2012; Xiao, Wei/G-6586-2012														0168-1923	1873-2240				OCT 15	2021	308								108600	10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108600	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108600		AUG 2021											WOS:000692679900049

The surrounding community makes use of the lake water for the multiple purposes of irrigation, domestic water supply, recreation and fish harvesting. The aim of the present study was to ascertain the water quality of the lake in terms of water quality indices (WQI) and its health over a period of three months covering both dry and wet seasons. Overall, the water quality of Lake was unfit and bad as per the weighted arithmetic method (120.06-228.29) and modified Bascaron water quality index (MBWQI) methods (26.81-33.89), respectively. However, the quality was indicated as marginal, as per the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) water quality index method (44.2-51.1). On average, the lake was under the hypertrophic stage as per the standard based on the results of Secchi depth and nutrient concentration. The current study showed the lake being unfit for all-purposes as per WAWQI range (> 100). According to the physicochemical and biological parameters, of the lake, it requires mitigation measures to control Eutrophication and pollutants inflow.

Six lakes surrounded by business units (commercial lakes) and park green spaces (park lakes) in the central area of Beijing, China, were monitored between June 2013 and October 2015. A total of 638 water samples were obtained. The results showed that the water quality was generally worse in the rainy season than in the dry season, with the mean dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration declining by 25.1 %. Compared to the rise in DO of park lakes after rainfall, commercial lakes showed a decreased DO. The nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) concentration decreased after rain, and that in commercial lakes decreased more than that in park lakes. Different from DO and NO3--N, the ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N)), total suspended solids (TSS) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations of the lakes increased obviously after rain. The values in park lakes increased 138 % (NH4+-N)), 120 % (TSS) and 69 % (TP) more than those in commercial lakes. Principal component analysis (PCA) results illustrated that green space was the main source of TSS and TP for urban lakes. Most of the nitrogen (N) comes from artificial impervious sur-faces. These results will help target pollutant control for urban lakes.					li, yingxia/AAO-6263-2020														0301-4797	1095-8630				NOV 15	2021	298								113514	10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113514	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113514		AUG 2021						34391108					WOS:000700579500009

Although the distribution of plastic debris in the sea and at coasts has been addressed, the transportation of plastics through a river system is unclear but important. The distribution of plastic debris in the Selenga River system is responsible for the environmental pollution of Lake Baikal. Twelve sampling sites along the river shore of the Selenga River system have been surveyed considering the industrial activity and population density. The number of plastics significantly correlates with the population density. The higher the number of plastics is, the smaller is the average size. The size fractions of foam and film plastics show a significant relationship, suggesting that the plastic debris fragmented on-site on the river shores. The most abundant plastic debris is polystyrene foam (PSF), which is usually used for construction and packaging. Plastic debris occurs due to insufficient plastic waste management. Its distribution is affected by seasonal changes of the water level and flow rate of tributaries. Furthermore, the fragmentation of plastic debris is related to temperature changes associated with freeze and thaw cycles, solar radiation, and mechanical abrasion. Smaller microplastics with microscopic sizes were detected in PSF debris. Based on micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, these microplastics are polystyrene and polyethylene. This study proves that invisible and visible microplastics are transported together.					; Battulga, Batdulam/LWI-6402-2024	Battulga, Batdulam/0000-0002-8908-5770; Kawahigashi, Masayuki/0000-0002-0933-7190; Oyuntsetseg, Bolormaa/0000-0002-2861-7841; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				MAY	2019	26	14					14059	14072		10.1007/s11356-019-04632-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-04632-1								30852749					WOS:000466906000036
J	Kim, Y; Kimball, JS; Glassy, J; Du, JY				Kim, Youngwook; Kimball, John S.; Glassy, Joseph; Du, Jinyang			An extended global Earth system data record on daily landscape freeze-thaw status determined from satellite passive microwave remote sensing	EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA												The landscape freeze-thaw (FT) signal determined from satellite microwave brightness temperature (T-b) observations has been widely used to define frozen temperature controls on land surface water mobility and ecological processes. Calibrated 37 GHz Tb retrievals from the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), and SSM/I Sounder (SSMIS) were used to produce a consistent and continuous global daily data record of landscape FT status at 25 km grid cell resolution. The resulting FT Earth system data record (FT-ESDR) is derived from a refined classification algorithm and extends over a larger domain and longer period (1979-2014) than prior FT-ESDR releases. The global domain encompasses all land areas affected by seasonal frozen temperatures, including urban, snow- and ice-dominant and barren land, which were not represented by prior FT-ESDR versions. The FT retrieval is obtained using a modified seasonal threshold algorithm (MSTA) that classifies daily Tb variations in relation to grid-cell-wise FT thresholds calibrated using surface air temperature data from model reanalysis. The resulting FT record shows respective mean annual spatial classification accuracies of 90.3 and 84.3% for evening (PM) and morning (AM) overpass retrievals relative to global weather station measurements. Detailed data quality metrics are derived characterizing the effects of sub-grid-scale open water and terrain heterogeneity, as well as algorithm uncertainties on FT classification accuracy. The FT-ESDR results are also verified against other independent cryospheric data, including in situ lake and river ice phenology, and satellite observations of Greenland surface melt. The expanded FT-ESDR enables new investigations encompassing snow- and ice-dominant land areas, while the longer record and favorable accuracy allow for refined global change assessments that can better distinguish transient weather extremes, landscape phenological shifts, and climate anomalies from longer-term trends extending over multiple decades.

Re-eutrophication of Lake Erie: Correlations between tributary nutrient loads and phytoplankton biomass	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Both abiotic and biotic explanations have been proposed to explain recent recurrent nuisance/harmful algal blooms in the western basin and central basin of Lake Erie. We used two long-term (>10 years) datasets to test (1) whether Lake Erie total phytoplankton biomass and cyanobacterial biomass changed over time and (2) whether phytoplankton abundance was influenced by soluble reactive phosphorus or nitrate loading from agriculturally-dominated tributaries (Maumee and Sandusky rivers). We found that whereas total phytoplankton biomass decreased in Lake Erie's western basin from 1970 to 1987, it increased starting in the mid-1990s. Total phytoplankton and cyanobacterial seasonal (May-October) arithmetic mean wet-weight biomasses each significantly increased with increased water-year total soluble reactive phosphorus load from the Maumee River and the sum of soluble reactive phosphorus load from the Maumee and Sandusky rivers, but not for the Sandusky River alone during 1996-2006. During this same time period, neither total phytoplankton nor cyanobacterial biomass was correlated with nitrate load. Consequently, recently increased tributary soluble reactive phosphorus loads from the Maumee River likely contributed greatly to increased western basin and (central basin) cyanobacterial biomass and more frequent occurrence of harmful algal blooms. Managers thus must incorporate the form of and source location from which nutrients are delivered to lakes into their management plans, rather than solely considering total (both in terms of form and amount) nutrient load to the whole lake. Further, future studies need to address the relative contributions of not only external loads, but also sources of internal loading. (C) 2014 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

However, little is known about the water use patterns of alpine riparian shrubs (e.g., Myricaria squamosa) in response to changes in soil water availability on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. This study examined the water-use patterns of M. squamosa along a zone of gradual degradation (light, moderate, and severe), located in the lower reaches of the Shaliu River in the Qinghai Lake watershed. Stable water isotopes (delta H-2 and delta O-18) in xylem water, soil water and groundwater, as well as leaf water potential were monitored during the growing seasons from 2012 to 2013, and quantified the water-use proportions via MixSIAR model. Results showed significant differences in the isotopic signatures of M. squamosa from the light, moderate, and severe degradation sites across seasons, suggesting that M. squamosa exploited different water sources. MixSIAR results also revealed that M. squamosa used high proportions of shallow soil water in the light degradation site (35.4%) compared with the severe degradation sites (13.4%). By contrast, M. squamosa exhibited an ability to shift its water sources and to rely more on groundwater in the severe degradation site across seasons. The contrasting water-use patterns of M. squamosa along the gradual degradation zone were closely linked with the distributions of active root zones when competing for water. Higher predawn leaf water potential (Psi(pd)) of M. squamosa (mean Psi(pd)=-2.29 +/- 0.7 MPa) was found in the light degradation site and lower Psi(pd) values in the severe degradation site (mean Psi(pd) = -3.3 +/- 0.8 MPa), suggesting that M. squamosa depended on a high degree of flexible plasticity in water use to alleviate water stress along the gradual degradation. These results linked to water-use patterns and ecophysiological characteristics (e.g., Psi(pd)) of plants responding to changes in available water are important for informing decision-making management strategies designed to prevent ecological degradation.

J	Khorrami, B; Ali, S; Sahin, OG; Gunduz, O				Khorrami, Behnam; Ali, Shoaib; Sahin, Onur Gungor; Gunduz, Orhan			Model-coupled GRACE-based analysis of hydrological dynamics of drying Lake Urmia and its basin	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Lake Urmia basin (LUB), in northwestern Iran, is under the influence of extreme degradation due to a number of natural and anthropogenic factors. The existence of the Lake is critical for the microclimate of the region as well as the quality of human life and wildlife, which necessitates an up-to-date and holistic analysis of its hydrological dynamics. In this premise, satellite-based terrestrial water storage (TWS) received from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission was coupled with hydrometeorological modelling and assessment tools to analyse the hydrological status of the lake and its basin. As a new gap-filling approach, the Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) (STL) decomposition technique was proposed in this study to reconstruct the missing TWS data. Integrating satellite precipitation data with the Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) and WaterGAP model outputs, the hydrological status of the lake was investigated. The STL-based TWS turned out to concord well with the simulated TWS from the CLSM indicating the acceptable performance of the proposed technique. The findings revealed that the LUB had undergone an alarming hydrological situation from 2003 to 2021 with a total loss of 10 and 7.56km3 from its TWS and groundwater storage (GWS), respectively. The water level time series also indicated that the water level of the lake had diminished with an annual rate of -70 +/- 21cm/year corresponding to a total water level depletion of about 13.35 +/- 3.9m during the 2003-2021 period. The GRACE-derived TWS and GWS also agreed well with the CLSM simulations. Assessment of the extreme events of the LUB suggested that the basin suffered from a severe dry event in 2008 resulting in the depletion of its water storage and water level. It was also found that from 2003 onward, a critical hydrological setting had dominated the LUB with a negative hydrological balance of -0.96km3.

In this paper, we present a simple yet robust method for fusing optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for mapping surface water dynamics over mainland China. This method uses a multivariate logistic regression model to estimate monthly surface water extent over a four-year period (2017 to 2020) from the combined usages of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 imagery. Multi-seasonal high-resolution images from the Chinese Gaofen satellites are used as a reference for an independent validation showing a high degree of agreement (overall accuracy 94%) across a diversity of climatic and physiographic regions demonstrating potential scalability beyond China. Through inter-comparison with similar global scale products, this paper further shows how this new mapping technique provides improved spatio-temporal characterization of inland water bodies, and for better capturing smaller water bodies (< 0.81 ha in size). The relevance of the results is discussed, and we find this new enhanced monitoring approach has the potential to advance the use of Earth observation for water resource management, planning and reporting.					; Lei, Xia/HNR-2726-2023	Kittel, Cecile Marie Margaretha/0000-0002-7711-9726; Druce, Daniel/0000-0002-4652-5158; Tong, Xiaoye/0000-0002-9709-0633; Lei, Xia/0000-0003-3640-2063; Tottrup, Christian/0000-0002-4937-0083														2072-4292				MAY	2021	13	9							1663	10.3390/rs13091663	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13091663													WOS:000650743900001

Spatial and temporal patterns of environmental DNA detection to inform sampling protocols in lentic and lotic systems	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The development of efficient sampling protocols for the capture of environmental DNA (eDNA) could greatly help improve accuracy of occupancy monitoring for species that are difficult to detect. However, the process of developing a protocol in situ is complicated for rare species by the fact that animal locations are often unknown. We tested sampling designs in lake and stream systems to determine the most effective eDNA sampling protocols for two rare species: the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog (Rana sierrae) and the foothill yellow-legged frog (Rana boylii). We varied water volume, spatial sampling, and seasonal timing in lakes and streams; in lakes we also tested multiple filter types. We found that filtering 2 L versus 1 L increased the odds of detection in streams 5.42X (95% CI: 3.2-9.19X) in our protocol, from a probability of 0.51-0.85 per technical replicate. Lake sample volumes were limited by filter clogging, and we found no effect of volume or filter type. Sampling later in the season increased the odds of detection in streams by 1.96X for every 30 days (95% CI: 1.3-2.97X) but there was no effect for lakes. Spatial autocorrelation of the quantity of yellow-legged frog eDNA captured in streams ceased between 100 and 200 m, indicating that sampling at close intervals is important.					; GOLDBERG, CAREN/JBJ-6316-2023	Boro, Mallory Bedwell/0000-0001-9553-6032; 													2045-7758					FEB	2020	10	3					1602	1612		10.1002/ece3.6014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.6014		JAN 2020						32076537					WOS:000510058900001

The scope and scale of understanding avian use of these wetlands in conjunction with changes in climate are daunting yet critical to address lest we lose continent-wide migratory pathways. Here, we assess changes in waterbird use of North America's Pacific Flyway in the Great Basin by examining water availability and climate trends over the past 100 years. We found recent (1980-2015) climate warming has significantly reduced the amount and shifted seasonality of water flowing into wetlands. Further, we found remarkable changes in waterbird species composition over time. We propose that a reduced hydroperiod and lower water quality from reduction in water level and flow limits sites used by waterbirds. These factors reduce chick survivorship as they cannot metabolize saline water, which makes suitable freshwater conditions a limiting resource. Collectively, climate-induced changes in Great Basin wetlands suggest a major shift in freshwater ecosystems, resulting in degradation of a continental migratory route. This work illustrates the importance of examining multiscale changes in critical regional resources to understand their impact across a hemispheric flyway and provides a model to examine other flyways.

Sinninghe			Seasonal variability and sources of in situ brGDGT production in a permanently stratified African crater lake	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Lake sediments are important archives of continental climate history, and their lipid biomarker content can be exploited to reconstruct paleoenvironmental conditions. Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) are bacterial membrane lipids widely used in paleoclimate studies to reconstruct past temperature. However, major gaps still exist in our understanding of the environmental controls on in situ (i.e. aquatic) production in lake systems. In Lake Chala, a permanently stratified tropical crater lake in East Africa, we determined the concentrations and fractional abundances of individual brGDGTs along depth profiles of suspended particulate matter collected monthly from September 2013 to January 2015 and in settling particles collected monthly at 35m water depth from August 2010 to January 2015 and compared these brGDGT distributions with those in surficial lake bottom sediments and catchment soils. We find that brGDGTs are primarily produced within the water column and that their concentrations and distributions vary greatly with depth and over time. Comparison with concentration-depth profiles of the monthly distribution and abundance of bacterial taxa, based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and quantification, indicates that Acidobacteria are likely not the main producers of brGDGTs in Lake Chala. Shallowing of the oxic-anoxic boundary during seasonal episodes of strong water column stratification promoted production of specific brGDGTs in the anoxic zone. BrGDGT distributions in the water column do not consistently relate with temperature, pH, or dissolved-oxygen concentration but do respond to transitions between episodes of strong stratification and deep (but partial) lake mixing, as does the aquatic bacterial community. Hence, the general link between brGDGT distributions and temperature in brGDGT-based paleothermometry is more likely driven by a change in bacterial community composition than by membrane adaptation of specific members of the bacterial community to changing environmental conditions. Although temperature is not the principal driver of distributional changes in aquatic brGDGTs in this system, at least not during the 17-month study period, abundance-weighted and time-integrated averages of brGDGT fractional abundance in the 53-month time series of settling particles reveal systematic variability over longer timescales that indirectly relates to temperature. Thus, although we do not as yet fully understand the drivers of modern-day brGDGT fluxes and distributions in Lake Chala, our data do support the application of brGDGT paleothermometry to time-integrated archives such as sediments.

Biased sampling of methane release from northern lakes: A problem for extrapolation	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Methane emissions from lakes are widely thought to be highly irregular and difficult to quantify with anything other than numerous distributed measurement stations and long-term sampling campaigns. In spite of this, a large majority of the study sites north of 50 degrees N have been measured over surprisingly short time periods of only one to a few days. Using long-term data from three intensively studied small subarctic lakes, we recommend that measurements of diffusive methane flux and ebullition should be made over at least 11 and 39days scattered throughout the ice-free season using depth-stratified sampling at 3 and 11 or more locations, respectively. We further show that low temporal and spatial resolutions are unlikely to cause overestimates. Therefore, we argue that most sites measured previously are likely underestimated in terms of emission potential. Avoiding these biases seen in much of the contemporary data is crucial to further constrain large-scale methane emissions from northern lakes and ponds.					; Crill, Patrick/ABC-1357-2021	Bastviken, David/0000-0003-0038-2152; Crill, Patrick/0000-0003-1110-3059													0094-8276	1944-8007				FEB 16	2016	43	3					1256	1262		10.1002/2015GL066501	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015GL066501													WOS:000372056600039
J	Nijhawan, A; Howard, G				Nijhawan, Anisha; Howard, Guy			Associations between climate variables and water quality in low- and middle-income countries: A scoping review	WATER RESEARCH												Understanding how climate change will affect water quality and therefore, health, is critical for building resilient water services in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where the effect of climate change will be felt most acutely. Evidence of the effect of climate variables such as temperate and rainfall on water quality can generate insights into the likely impact of future climate change. While the seasonal effects on water quality are known, and there is strong qualitative evidence that climate change will impact water quality, there are no reviews that synthesise quantitative evidence from LMICs on links between climate variables and water quality. We mapped the available evidence on a range of climate exposures and water quality outcomes and identified 98 peer-reviewed studies. This included observational studies on the impact of temperature and rainfall events (which may cause short-term changes in contaminant concentrations), and modelling studies on the long-term impacts of sea level rise. Evidence on links between antecedent rainfall and microbiological contamination of water supplies is strong and relatively evenly distributed geographically, but largely focused on faecal indicator bacteria and on untreated shallow groundwater sources of drinking water. The literature on climate effects on geogenic contaminants was sparse. There is substantial research on the links between water temperature and cyanobacteria blooms in surface waters, although most studies were from two countries and did not examine potential effects on water treatment. Similarly, studies modelling the impact of sea level rise on groundwater salinity, mostly from south-Asia and the Middle East, did not discuss challenges for drinking water supplies. We identified key future research priorities based on this review. These include: more studies on specific pathogens (including opportunistic pathogens) in water supplies and their relationships with climate variables; more studies that assess likely relationships between climate variables and water treatment processes; studies into the relationships between climate variables and geogenic contaminants, including risks from heavy metals released as glacier retreat; and, research into the impacts of wildfires on water quality in LMICs given the current dearth of studies but recognised importance.

This work aimed to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of forests in the West Dongting Lake region from 2000 to 2018 using a reconstructed monthly Landsat NDVI time series. The multi-type forest changes, including conversion from forest to another land cover category, conversion from another land cover category to forest, and conversion from forest to forest (such as flooding and replantation post-deforestation), and land cover categories before and after change were effectively detected by integrating Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) and random forest algorithms with the monthly NDVI time series, with an overall accuracy of 87.8%. On the basis of focusing on all the forest regions extracted through creating a forest mask for each image in time series and merging these to produce an 'anytime' forest mask, the spatiotemporal dynamics of forest were analyzed on the basis of the acquired information of multi-type forest changes and classification. The forests are principally distributed in the core zone of West Donting Lake surrounding the water body and the southwestern mountains. The forest changes in the core zone and low elevation region are prevalent and frequent. The variation of forest areas in West Dongting Lake experienced three steps: rapid expansion of forest plantation from 2000 to 2005, relatively steady from 2006 to 2011, and continuous decline since 2011, mainly caused by anthropogenic factors, such as government policies and economic profits. This study demonstrated the applicability of the integrated BFAST method to detect multi-type forest changes by using dense Landsat time series in the subtropical wetland ecosystem with low data availability.

These blooms are relatively easy to detect optically because of the surface concentration of cells, the presence of phycocyanin pigments, and the elevated backscatter associated with cell size and the presence of gas vacuoles. Major challenges limiting the use of remote sensing have been, first, that many of these water bodies are small relative to the spatial resolution of ocean color satellites, and second, even with a bright algal target, the spectral resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and repeat time for terrestrial satellites is often inadequate. The next generation of multispectral and hyperspectral sensors begin to address these issues with both increased spatial and spectral resolution. Weekly monitoring of Pinto Lake, California has demonstrated that this small water body provides an ideal testbed for development and application of algorithms applicable for legacy and next-generation sensors. Pinto Lake experiences seasonal nearly monospecific blooms with a pronounced species succession. Biomass (as chlorophyll) within Pinto Lake seasonally ranges from similar to 1 to 1000 mu g/L. Pinto Lake has been within the flight lines for several recent airborne missions, including the HyspIRI Preparatory Flight Campaign, and is often targeted for HICO acquisitions. Using these data we demonstrate that spectral-shape algorithms requiring minimal atmospheric correction can be used across a range of legacy sensors to detect cyanobacterial blooms and that, with the availability of high spectral resolution data and appropriate atmospheric correction, it is possible to separate the cyanobacterial genera Aphanizomenon and Microcystis. In California Aphanizomenon is typically non-toxic and blooms prior to toxin-producing Micro cystis, thus leading to the potential for an early warning system based on the identification of algal types.

J	Makula, EK; Zhou, BT				Makula, Exavery Kisesa; Zhou, Botao			Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 evaluation and projection of East African precipitation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												This study evaluates the performance of 43 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) models in reproducing annual cycle, climatology, and trend of observed precipitation over East Africa during 1950-2014. The results show that the CMIP6 models display good performance in simulating the annual cycle (i.e., bimodal pattern) of East African precipitation; however, most models and the multimodel ensemble mean (ENSEM) underestimate the March to May (MAM) precipitation while overestimating the October to December (OND) precipitation. Spatially, most models seem to perform relatively better in simulating OND precipitation compared to MAM season, despite wet (dry) biases over most parts of East Africa with the wettest (driest) biases over the Lake Victoria basin (southeastern Tanzania) during OND (MAM). The metrics have shown that nine models (i.e., MPI-ESM1-2-HR, AWI-CM-1-MR, MPI-ESM1-2-LR, IPSL-CM6A-LR, CAS-ESM2-0, BCC-CSM2-MR, NorESM2-LM, CESM2-WACCM, and CMCC-CM2-SR5) outperform the other individual models during both OND and MAM. Compared with individual models, the ENSEM better agrees with the observation. Besides, the ENSEM and most models can reproduce the increasing trend in OND precipitation as observed over East Africa. However, for the secular change of MAM precipitation, given that half of the models show increasing trends, the ENSEM simulation produces an inconsistent trend with the observation. The ensemble of the above nine models with better performance projects an increase of precipitation averaged over East Africa in both MAM and OND by the end of the 21st century, with larger changes under SSP5-8.5 than under SSP2-4.5. Spatially, the largest percentage increase in MAM precipitation is projected to occur in central Tanzania and northwestern Kenya, while southeastern Tanzania shows the greatest percentage decrease. The projected percentage increases in OND precipitation are larger in the northeastern highlands of Tanzania and northwest Kenya.

Compared with eutrophication issues in lakes and reservoirs, the characteristic identification and cause analysis of river algal blooms have been rarely studied, and the cause of river algal bloom remains an academic difficulty. This study aimed to analyze the characteristics and causes of algal blooms in a large river system in China, the Hanjiang River, from 2004 to 2014 by applying various statistical approaches. Statistical analyses included seasonal trend decomposition procedure based on Loess, cross wavelet analysis, Spearman analysis, and redundancy analysis. Results showed the following. (1) The high risk period of algal bloom in Hanjiang River occurred from mid-February to early-March, and the peak value tended to move forward from early-February to mid-February after 2009. (2) The water level of Yangtze River, total P, and water temperature were main contribution factors for river algal blooms downstream of Hanjiang River in China, contributing 44.5%, 39.6%, and 11.4%, respectively. (3) Hydrologic factors played important roles for the occurrences of river algal blooms when a suitable hydrodynamic condition existed between water flow of Hanjiang River and water level of Yangtze River. Finally, the key factors leading to river algal blooms are discussed, and further studies are suggested to ascertain the influence of complex hydrodynamic conditions in order to reveal the cause of river algal blooms.

The increasing availability of high spatial-temporal resolution remote sensing data provides an unprecedented opportunity for wetland dynamic monitoring and change detection. Using the reconstructed dense monthly Landsat time series, this study focuses on the continuous monitoring of vegetation dynamics in Dongting Lake wetland, south China, in the last two decades (2000-2019) by using the Bayesian estimator of abrupt change, seasonal change, and trend (BEAST) method. Firstly, the flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF) model is applied to blend Landsat and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images on the basis of the input image pair selection strategy named "cross-fusion" to generate the monthly time-series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with the spatial resolution of 30 m. Then, the abrupt changes, trend, and seasonality of the vegetation in the study area as well as the uncertainties of change detection are estimated by the BEAST method. Results show that there is a close relationship between the ground true data and the estimated changepoints. A high overall accuracy (OA) of 87.37% and Kappa coefficient of 0.85 were achieved by the proposed framework. Additionally, the temporal validation got the interval intersection of 86.57% and the absolute difference of mean interval length of 6.8 days. All of the results demonstrate that the vegetation changes in the Dongting Lake wetland varied spatially and temporally in the last two decades, because of extreme weathers and anthropogenic factors. The presented approach can accurately identify the vegetation changes and time of disturbance in both the spatial and temporal domains, and also can retrieve the evolution process of wetland vegetation under the influence of climate changes and human activities. Therefore, it can be used to reveal potential causes of the degradation and recovery of wetland vegetation in subtropical areas.

Where glaciers meet water: Subaqueous melt and its relevance to glaciers in various settings	REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS												Glacier change is ubiquitous, but the fastest and largest magnitude changes occur in glaciers that terminate in water. This includes the most rapidly retreating glaciers, and also several advancing ones, often in similar regional climate settings. Furthermore, water-terminating glaciers show a large range in morphology, particularly when ice flow into ocean water is compared to that into freshwater lakes. All water-terminating glaciers share the ability to lose significant volume of ice at the front, either through mechanical calving or direct melt from the water in contact. Here we present a review of the subaqueous melt process. We discuss the relevant physics and show how different physical settings can lead to different glacial responses. We find that subaqueous melt can be an important trigger for glacier change. It can explain many of the morphological differences, such as the existence or absence of floating tongues. Subaqueous melting is influenced by glacial runoff, which is largely a function of atmospheric conditions. This shows a tight connection between atmosphere, oceans and lakes, and glaciers. Subaqueous melt rates, even if shown to be large, should always be discussed in the context of ice supply to the glacier front to assess its overall relevance. We find that melt is often relevant to explain seasonal evolution, can be instrumental in shifting a glacier into a different dynamical regime, and often forms a large part of a glacier's mass loss. On the other hand, in some cases, melt is a small component of mass loss and does not significantly affect glacier response.

A review of sediment diversion in the Mississippi River Deltaic Plain	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												One of the proposed methods for restoring the disappearing Mississippi Delta is sediment diversion which uses channels and structures to divert water and sediment from the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers into adjacent basins. This study presents a comprehensive review of geological and physical aspects of sediment dynamics in the Mississippi River Deltaic Plain (MRDP), with special reference to diversion studies over the past two decades. We synthesize these studies, present the current understanding of sediment diversions in the context of sediment dynamics, identify multiple key knowledge gaps, and make recommendations for future studies. To maximize net land building in the MRDP, management strategies should be focused on (a) enhancing river sediment delivery (both mud and sand), (b) increasing sediment retention in receiving basins and (c) minimizing erosion in bays and estuaries. Compared with extensive studies of land building, there have been relatively fewer studies of erosional processes. A heterogeneous coastal geological framework, cohesive sediment erodibility and subsidence together play complicated yet critical roles in future sediment dynamics in bays and estuaries of the MRDP. Sediment retention rates are highly sensitive to spatial and temporal scales, types of sediments and delivery season. Sediment diversions to seaward receiving basins provide more surge protection but tend to have lower sediment retention due to active coastal processes. Structures and devices that improve sediment retention, trap sediments, dissipate waves, and build living shorelines should be explored and cost-to-benefit analysis is needed. Long-term planning should consider more landward diversions, strategic community relocation, and nonlinear response of the complex sedimentary system of the MRDP.					; F, A/AAQ-9499-2021; Xu, Kehui/D-5446-2009	Bentley, Samuel/0000-0001-5826-7689; Xu, Kehui/0000-0002-3696-6160; Freeman, Angelina/0000-0002-9747-8320													0272-7714	1096-0015				SEP 30	2019	225								106241	10.1016/j.ecss.2019.05.023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2019.05.023													WOS:000478712800016

The particulate concentrations of heavy metals in water were much higher than the dissolved concentrations. According to Nemerow pollution index (Pi), pollution degrees by Fe, V, Mn and As ranged from heavy (2 <= Pi < 4) to serious (Pi >= 4). The concentrations of most heavy metals were the highest during the medium-water period and the lowest during the dry season. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling Analysis confirmed heavy metal concentrations had slight spatial difference but relatively large seasonal variation. Redundancy Analysis indicated the close associations of heavy metals with nutrient and physicochemical indicators. When both nutrient and physicochemical indicators were used as input variables, the simulation effects for most elements in total and particulate were relatively better than those obtained using only nutrient or only physicochemical indicators. The simulation effects for As, Ba, Fe, Ti, V and Zn were generally good, based on their training R values of 0.847, 0.828, 0.856, 0.867, 0.817 and 0.893, respectively, as well as their test R values of 0.811, 0.836, 0.843, 0.873, 0.829 and 0.826, respectively; and meanwhile, in both the training and test stages, these metals also had relatively lower errors. The spatial distribution of heavy metals in Chaohu Lake was then predicted using the fully trained SVM models. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The sudden emptying of these lakes releases large volumes of water and sediment in destructive glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), one of the most publicised natural hazards to the rapidly growing Himalayan population. Despite the growing number and size of glacial lakes, the frequency of documented GLOFs is remarkably constant. We explore this possible reporting bias and offer a new processing chain for establishing a more complete Himalayan GLOF inventory. We make use of the full seasonal archive of Landsat images between 1988 and 2016, and track automatically where GLOFs left shrinking water bodies, and tails of sediment at high elevations. We trained a Random Forest classifier to generate fuzzy land cover maps for 2491 images, achieving overall accuracies of 91%. We developed a likelihood-based change point technique to estimate the timing of GLOFs at the pixel scale. Our method objectively detected ten out of eleven documented GLOFs, and another ten lakes that gave rise to previously unreported GLOFs. We thus nearly doubled the existing GLOF record for a study area covering similar to 10% of the HKH region. Remaining challenges for automatically detecting GLOFs include image insufficiently accurate co-registration, misclassifications in the land cover maps and image noise from clouds, shadows or ice. Yet our processing chain is robust and has the potential for being applied on the greater HKH and mountain ranges elsewhere, opening the door for objectively expanding the knowledge base on GLOF activity over the past three decades.					; Walz, Ariane/F-1517-2013	Korup, Oliver/0000-0002-9084-1895; Walz, Ariane/0000-0001-5616-4424													0034-4257	1879-0704				MAR 15	2018	207						84	97		10.1016/j.rse.2017.12.025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2017.12.025													WOS:000428007200007

The existence of a global tipping point, a warming threshold beyond which permafrost thaw would accelerate and become self-perpetuating, remains debated. Here we provide an integrative Perspective on this question, suggesting that despite several permafrost-thaw feedbacks driving rapid thaw and irreversible ground-ice loss at local to regional scales, the accumulated response of Arctic permafrost to climate warming remains quasilinear. We argue that in the absence of a global tipping point there is no safety margin within which permafrost loss would be acceptable. Instead, each increment of global warming subjects more land areas underlain by permafrost to thaw, causing detrimental local impacts and global feedbacks. It has been postulated that there is a threshold temperature above which permafrost will reach a global tipping point, causing accelerated thaw and global collapse.

Vegetation, as an important part of the ecosystem, has undergone considerable changes in recent decades in this area, but few studies have focused on the process of vegetation change. A long normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series dataset based on remote sensing is an effective tool to investigate large-scale vegetation change dynamics. The MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI dataset has provided very detailed regional to global information on the state of vegetation since 2000. The aim of this study was to explore the spatial-temporal characteristics of abrupt vegetation changes and detect their potential drivers in the Qilian Mountain area using MODIS NDVI data with 1 km resolution from 2000 to 2017. The Breaks for Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) algorithm was adopted to detect vegetation breakpoint change times and magnitudes from satellite observations. Our results indicated that approximately 80.1% of vegetation areas experienced at least one abrupt change from 2000 to 2017, andmost of these areaswere distributed in the southern and northern parts of the study area, especially the area surrounding Qinghai Lake. The abrupt browning changes were much more widespread than the abrupt greening changes for most years of the study period. Environmental factors and anthropogenic activities mainly drove the abrupt vegetation changes. Long-term overgrazing is likely the main cause of the abrupt browning changes. In addition, our results indicate that national ecological protection policies have achieved positive effects in the study area.

The Impact of Sampling Season and Catching Site (Wild and Aquaculture) on Gut Microbiota Composition and Diversity of Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)	BIOLOGY-BASEL												Simple Summary The gut microbiota (all microbes in the intestine) of fishes is known to play an essential role in diverse aspects of their life. The gut microbiota of fish is affected by various environmental parameters, including temperature changes, salinity and diet. This study characterised the microbial composition in gut samples of Nile Tilapia collected from Lake Tana and the Bahir Dar aquaculture facility centre applying modern molecular techniques. The results show clear differences in the gut microbiota in fish from the Lake Tana and the ones from aquaculture. Further, also significant differences were observed on the composition of the gut microbiota across sampling months. Samples from the aquaculture centre displayed a higher diversity than the wild catch Nile tilapia from Lake Tana even though there is also an overlapping of the detected microbial groups. Overall, this is the first study on the effects of sampling season and catching site on the gut microbiota of Nile tilapia in Ethiopia. Future work will help to precisely explain the causes of these changes and their influence of the health and growth of Nile tilapia in Ethiopian lakes as well as under aquaculture conditions. The gut microbiota of fishes is known to play an essential role in diverse aspects of host biology. The gut microbiota of fish is affected by various environmental parameters, including temperature changes, salinity and diet. Studies of effect of environment on gut microbiota enables to have a further understanding of what comprises a healthy microbiota under different environmental conditions. However, there is insufficient understanding regarding the effects of sampling season and catching site (wild and aquaculture) on the gut microbiota of Nile tilapia. This study characterised gut microbial composition and diversity from samples collected from Lake Tana and the Bahir Dar aquaculture facility centre using 16S rDNA Illumina MiSeq platform sequencing. Firmicutes and Fusobacteria were the most dominant phyla in the Lake Tana samples, while Proteobacteria was the most dominant in the aquaculture samples. The results of differential abundance testing clearly indicated significant differences for Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria across sampling months. However, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Fusobacteria and Cyanobacteria were significantly enriched in the comparison of samples from the Lake Tana and aquaculture centre. Significant differences were observed in microbial diversity across sampling months and between wild and captive Nile tilapia. The alpha diversity clearly showed that samples from the aquaculture centre (captive) had a higher diversity than the wild Nile tilapia samples from Lake Tana. The core gut microbiota of all samples of Nile tilapia used in our study comprised Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria. This study clearly showed the impact of sampling season and catching site (wild and aquaculture) on the diversity and composition of bacterial communities associated with the gut of Nile tilapia. Overall, this is the first study on the effects of sampling season and catching site on the gut microbiota of Nile tilapia in Ethiopia. Future work is recommended to precisely explain the causes of these changes using large representative samples of Nile tilapia from different lakes and aquaculture farms.					; Domig, Konrad J./A-6877-2019; Abebe, Getachew/LZE-1681-2025; Bereded, Negash Kabtimer/AAX-3355-2020; Curto, Manuel/Y-5310-2019; Domig, Konrad/A-6877-2019	Abebe, Getachew/0000-0002-1261-1920; Fanta, Solomon Workneh/0000-0002-0244-1104; Domig, Konrad J./0000-0003-1090-4284; Curto, Manuel/0000-0002-1630-4653; Waidbacher, Herwig/0000-0002-6205-5977; Bereded, Negash Kabtimer/0000-0003-1122-9452; 														2079-7737				MAR	2021	10	3							180	10.3390/biology10030180	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology10030180								33804538					WOS:000633321200001

However, seasonal patterns of DOM photochemical properties in urban rivers remain unclear. In this study, two seasons (wet and dry) of water samples were collected from eleven sites throughout the Pearl River (China) to investigate the spatiotemporal variability of DOM optical and photochemical properties. The optical properties of DOM in the Pearl River were characterized by UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopies, which showed the substantial decrease in absorption coefficient and fluorescence intensity and increase in absorbence ratio (E2/E3) and specific absorption coefficient (SUVA) from the wet to dry season. The photochemical properties in terms of the apparent quantum yields of 3DOM*, 1O2 and .OH from DOM (phi 3DOM*, phi 1O2 and phi.OH, DOM) under illumination also displayed a significant decrease from the wet to the dry season. Spearman's rank correlation analysis revealed the strongest relationships between phi 3DOM*, phi 1O2 and phi.OH, DOM and the relative abundance of microbial humic-like component (C2%) derived from parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Partial least squares regression (PLSR) modelling exhibited an excellent prediction strength for steady-state concentrations of 1O2 ([1O2]ss) and .OH ([.OH]ss) with adjusted R2 values of 0.85 and 0.91, respectively, by using DOC concentration ([DOC]), optical properties, nitrate and nitrite concentrations as the response variables. In addition, the model identified that the Fmax of humic-like component C4 (Fmax-C4) was the most effective predictor amongst the used response variables. This study provides an approach to describe and predict the seasonal patterns of DOM photochemical properties in urbanized rivers, offering a good understanding of the formation mechanism of reactive species from river DOM.

Most of the industries within the catchment area of river Damodar have been closed; as a result, significant changes have been reflected throughout the stretch of river Damodar. The main objective of the study is to analyze the impact of lockdown on the water quality of river Damodar. A total of 55 samples was collected from eleven different confluence sites of nallas with the main river channel during and pre-lockdown period. The relevant methods like WQI, TSI, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and "t" test have been applied to evaluate the physical, chemical, and biological status of river water. The result of "t" test indicated that there are significant differences (alpha = 0.05) of each parameter between pre and during lockdown. Water quality index (WQI) is used for analysis of drinking water quality suitability followed by BIS. The values of WQI showed "very poor" (S1, S2, S3, S6, S7, and S11) to "unfit for drinking" (S4, S5, S8, S9, and S10) of river water during pre-monsoon season. The nutrient enrichment status of the river was analyzed by Trophic State Index (TSI) method and it shows the "High" eutrophic condition with a heavy concentration of algal blooms in almost an entire stretch. During lockdown, nutrient supplies like TN and TP have been reduced and is designated as "Low" (S1, S2) to "Moderate" (S3 to S11) eutrophic condition of middle stretch of Damodar. This research output of river Damodar will definitely assist to policy makers for sustainable environmental management despite the dilemma between development and conservation.

Revealing biogeochemical signatures of Arctic landscapes with river chemistry	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Riverine fluxes of carbon and inorganic nutrients are increasing in virtually all large permafrost-affected rivers, indicating major shifts in Arctic landscapes. However, it is currently difficult to identify what is causing these changes in nutrient processing and flux because most long-term records of Arctic river chemistry are from small, headwater catchments draining <200 km(2) or from large rivers draining >100,000 km(2). The interactions of nutrient sources and sinks across these scales are what ultimately control solute flux to the Arctic Ocean. In this context, we performed spatially-distributed sampling of 120 subcatchments nested within three Arctic watersheds spanning alpine, tundra, and glacial-lake landscapes in Alaska. We found that the dominant spatial scales controlling organic carbon and major nutrient concentrations was 3-30 km(2), indicating a continuum of diffuse and discrete sourcing and processing dynamics. These patterns were consistent seasonally, suggesting that relatively fine-scale landscape patches drive solute generation in this region of the Arctic. These network-scale empirical frameworks could guide and benchmark future Earth system models seeking to represent lateral and longitudinal solute transport in rapidly changing Arctic landscapes.					; Bowden, William/J-9219-2014; Frei, Robert/N-6798-2014; Zarnetske, Jay/F-4685-2010; Iannucci, Frances/MZS-1713-2025; Abbott, Benjamin/G-1733-2017	Frei, Rebecca/0000-0002-4272-0474; Iannucci, Frances/0000-0002-7554-1819; Zarnetske, Jay/0000-0001-7194-5245; Abbott, Benjamin/0000-0001-5861-3481													2045-2322					SEP 9	2019	9								12894	10.1038/s41598-019-49296-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-49296-6								31501454					WOS:000484657300018

Recent Advances in Our Understanding of the Role of Meltwater in the Greenland Ice Sheet System	CURRENT CLIMATE CHANGE REPORTS												Purpose of the Review This review discusses the role that meltwater plays within the Greenland ice sheet system. The ice sheet's hydrology is important because it affects mass balance through its impact on meltwater runoff processes and ice dynamics. The review considers recent advances in our understanding of the storage and routing of water through the supraglacial, englacial, and subglacial components of the system and their implications for the ice sheet. Recent Findings There have been dramatic increases in surface meltwater generation and runoff since the early 1990s, both due to increased air temperatures and decreasing surface albedo. Processes in the subglacial drainage system have similarities to valley glaciers and in a warming climate, the efficiency of meltwater routing to the ice sheet margin is likely to increase. The behaviour of the subglacial drainage system appears to limit the impact of increased surface melt on annual rates of ice motion, in sections of the ice sheet that terminate on land, while the large volumes of meltwater routed subglacially deliver significant volumes of sediment and nutrients to downstream ecosystems. Summary Considerable advances have been made recently in our understanding of Greenland ice sheet hydrology and its wider influences. Nevertheless, critical gaps persist both in our understanding of hydrology-dynamics coupling, notably at tidewater glaciers, and in runoff processes which ensure that projecting Greenland's future mass balance remains challenging.					; Slater, Donald/KJI-9596-2024	Slater, Donald/0000-0001-8394-6149; 													2198-6061					DEC	2017	3	4					330	344		10.1007/s40641-017-0083-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40641-017-0083-9													WOS:000461109800014

As a result of the dissolved inorganic carbon fertilization effect, lake ecosystem is expected to respond more sensitively to nitrogen (N) addition in karst region than in non-karst region. Identifying accurately the sources of nitrate in lake system is an important prerequisite for formulating effective strategies on reducing nitrate and restoring water ecosystem. Quantitative identification of nitrate sources to lakes in karst region is limited until now. In this study, delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- were jointly used to identify the nitrate sources in Caohai Lake, a typical karst lake. The delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- of lake water displayed significant seasonal variations. The average delta N-15-NO3- values during normal, dry and wet seasons were 6.6 parts per thousand, 12.7 parts per thousand and 0.9 parts per thousand, respectively. Accordingly, the average delta O-18-NO3(-) values were 11 parts per thousand, 13 parts per thousand and 16 parts per thousand, respectively. The average contribution percentages of nitrate from agricultural activities, precipitation and sewage were 42 %, 41 % and 17 %, respectively. Strict measures should be taken to prohibit unreasonable agricultural activities and to improve nutrient use efficiency through optimized fertilization and irrigation management. In view of the sensitivity of karst lake ecosystem to N/P addition, higher discharge standard requirement is necessary for restoring water ecosystem and maintaining good water quality. This study proved that the combined use of delta N-15-NO3 and delta O-18-NO3- is a promising method for identifying quantitatively the nitrate sources in karst lake system.					; Wang, Jingfu/ABG-1486-2021; jianyang, guo/N-9506-2019	Yang, Haiquan/0000-0003-4826-8199; Wang, Jingfu/0000-0003-0666-6041; 													0167-8809	1873-2305				NOV 1	2020	303								107089	10.1016/j.agee.2020.107089	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2020.107089													WOS:000566695800004

Accurate estimation of Delta S-w will contribute to improved understanding of lake variations in the TP. Based on a water balance, this study explored the variations of Delta S-w for the Lake Selin Co (the largest closed lake on the TP) during 2003-2012 using the Water and Energy Budget-based Distributed Hydrological Model (WEB-DHM) together with two different evapotranspiration (ET) algorithms (the Penman-Monteith method and a simple sublimation estimation approach for water area in unfrozen and frozen period). The contributions of basin discharge and climate causes to the Delta S-w are also quantitatively analyzed. The results showed that WEB-DHM could well reproduce daily discharge, the spatial pattern, and basin-averaged values of MODIS land surface temperature (LST) during nighttime and daytime. Compared with the ET reference values estimated from the basin-wide water balance, our ET estimates showed better performance than three global ET products in reproducing basin-averaged ET. The modeled ET at point scale matches well with short-term in situ daily measurements (RMSE = 0.82 mm/d). Lake inflows and precipitation over the water area had stronger relationships with Delta S-w in the warm season and monthly scale, whereas evaporation from the water area had remarkable effects on Delta S-w in the cold season. The total contribution of the three factors to Delta S-w was about 90%, and accounting for 49.5%, 22.1%, and 18.3%, respectively.

J	Ye, XC; Meng, YK; Xu, LG; Xu, CY				Ye, Xu-chun; Meng, Yuan-ke; Xu, Li-gang; Xu, Chong-yu			Net primary productivity dynamics and associated hydrological driving factors in the floodplain wetland of China's largest freshwater lake	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Wetlands are thought to be the most unique ecosystem in the world which plays an important role in water and material circulation. However, investigation of ecosystem dynamics in those lake floodplain wetlands that suffering rapid and significant short-term water level fluctuation is quite a challenge. In this study, the short-and long-term characteristics of vegetation NPP (net primary productivity) and their driving mechanism were investigated in the Poyang Lake floodplain wetland, an important international wetland that listed in the Global Eco-region by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). Attempts were achieved through validating the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model based on observed biomasses of different vegetation types and reconstructed continuous high spatiotemporal resolution (30 m and 16 days) of NDVI data during 2000-2015 according to the fused Landsat and MODIS data. Major result indicates that the intra-annual variation of NPP of most vegetation types shows two peaks in a year due to combined effects of vegetation growth rhythm and seasonal exposure of the lake floodplain. Annual NPP of the lake floodplain ranges in 360.09-735.94 gC/m2 and shows an increasing trend during the study period. The change of NPP in space indicates that the distribution elevation of the major vegetation types decreased and evoluted toward the center lake floodplain. Different from the terrestrial ecosystem, inundation duration is the dominant factor that controls NPP dynamics in the lake floodplain, while the influences of other meteorological factors are much weakened. Recent decline of lake water level was the major reason for the spatio-temporal evolution of annual and seasonal vegetation NPP in the lake floodplain. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

J	Peeters, F; Fernandez, JE; Hofmann, H				Peeters, Frank; Fernandez, Jorge Encinas; Hofmann, Hilmar			Sediment fluxes rather than oxic methanogenesis explain diffusive CH4 emissions from lakes and reservoirs	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Methane emissions from lakes and reservoirs are a major natural source in the global budget of atmospheric CH4. A large fraction of these emissions are due to diffusive transport of CH4 from surface waters to the atmosphere. It was suggested recently that CH4 production in the oxic surface waters is required to compensate for diffusive CH4 emissions from lakes. In contrast, we demonstrate here that typical diffusive CH4-fluxes from sediments in shallow water zones, F-sed,F-S, suffice to explain CH4 emissions to the atmosphere. Our analysis is based on the combination of an exceptional data set on surface concentrations of CH4 with a mass balance model of CH4 that is focused on the surface mixed layer and considers CH4-fluxes from sediments, lateral transport, gas exchange with the atmosphere, and includes temperature dependencies of sediment fluxes and gas exchange. F-sed,F-S not only explains observed surface CH4 concentrations but also concentration differences between shallow and open water zones, and the seasonal variability of emissions and lateral concentration distributions. Hence, our results support the hypothesis that diffusive fluxes from shallow sediments and not oxic methanogenesis are the main source of the CH4 in the surface waters and the CH4 emitted from lakes and reservoirs.

J	Bi, B; Liu, XH; Guo, XC; Lu, SY				Bi, Bin; Liu, Xiaohui; Guo, Xiaochun; Lu, Shaoyong			Occurrence and risk assessment of heavy metals in water, sediment, and fish from Dongting Lake, China	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												In this study, 15 representative surface waters and sediments and seven typical fish were collected during the wet season in 2016 to explore the occurrence, chemical fractionation, and ecological risk of heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Cr, Hg, As, and Ni) in aquatic ecosystems of Dongting Lake in China. In surface water, the concentrations of all elements were lower than the third grade of the surface water quality standards (GB3838-2002). The highest concentrations of Zn, Pb, Cd, Ni, and Cu were found in the outlet of Dongting Lake, whereas As and Cr were highest in the Xiangjiang River Delta area. In surface sediments, the concentration decreased in the order of Zn>Cr>Pb>Cu>Ni>As>Cd>Hg; the highest concentration of all elements, except for Hg, was located in the Xiangjiang River Delta area; for chemical fractionation, Cr, Hg, Zn, As, Ni, and Cu were mainly residual fractionation; and Pb and Cd were mainly in a reducible state and fraction soluble in acid, respectively. In fish muscle, the concentrations of all elements were lower than relevant standards; the highest concentration appeared in fish living in the middle-lower and demersal layers. As for the feeding habits of fish, the average concentration decreased in the order of carnivorous>omnivorous>herbivorous fish. The potential ecological risk and the ratio of secondary phase to primary phase assessment showed that Cd and Hg had the highest ecological risk and that Cd and Pb had a high risk of secondary release. A health risk assessment showed that drinking water and fish for consumption in urban and rural areas around Dongting Lake were in the acceptable level.

Sediment and palynological proxy data provide a finely resolved regional environmental history of the East Asian monsoon. A varve-based chronology (shl-vc2) has been established for the last 65,000 years and allows a detailed comparison with other long regional and global palaeoclimate records. Vegetation density of the study area depends, on the long run, on precessionally forced insolation changes, with superimposed millennial-scale variability during the last Glacial. Periodic increase of organic carbon content and thermophilous tree species like Ulmus and Fraxinus and contemporary decrease of shrub Alnus precisely mirror millennial-scale climatic variations primarily known from Greenland ice-cores as Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles, as well as Late-glacial period climate changes. Percentages of trees & shrubs pollen and in particular lake productivity-related data reveal substantial differences between interstadial intensities, with those between 50 and 60 ka BP being more pronounced than the following ones.

Remote sensing is considered as an effective approach to monitor aquatic vegetations and algae blooms. However, individual spectral index is unable to separate them due to the similarity in spectral features. In this paper, spectral characteristics analyses were conducted to find suitable spectral indices for distinguishing emergent vegetation, submerged aquatic vegetation and floating yellow algae in a complex aquatic environment, Ulansuhai Lake, China. It was found that near infrared band was appropriate to extract open water, and short-wave infrared band was suitable for extracting emergent vegetation, whereas the green and red bands were the characteristic spectra for distinguishing submerged aquatic vegetation and yellow algae. Hence, we firstly used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to extract open water, and the emergent vegetation spectral index (EVSI) to extract emergent vegetation. Then, a new developed macroalgae index (MAI) was used for distinguishing submerged aquatic vegetation and yellow algae. The applicability of the spectral indices was tested against both in situ measurements and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data. The results indicated that the combination of these spectral indices was an effective method to separate aquatic vegetations and yellow algae. The proposed method was then applied to time-series Landsat images for investigating the seasonal and inter annual dynamics of aquatic vegetations and yellow algae and their responses to air temperature in the Ulansuhai Lake. The results show that emergent vegetation area increased from May to its maximum in July. The submerged aquatic vegetation area gradually increased from May to its maximum coverage in August, and decreased from late September. The yellow algae appeared in late May, and reached its maximum area in June or July, and disappeared in October. The long-term variation analyses showed that emergent vegetation area increased from 1986 to 2014, and was decreasing from 2014. The area of submerged aquatic vegetation increased during 1986-2008, and sharply decreased from 2009 to 2013, followed by a significant increasing from 2014. The yellow algae bloom mainly outbroke during the period of 1998 to 2010. We also found that the yellow algae area was more sensitive to short term mean temperature, while the area of emergent vegetation was sensitive to longer timescale of temperature. The submerged aquatic vegetation area had no significant correlation with air temperature. Besides, our study also indicated that the MAI concept can be extendable and applicable to other high-resolution satellite sensors (e.g., GF-2 PMS) and other regions with different algae blooms (e.g., Yellow Sea).

However, the effects of eutrophication and seasonality on methanogenesis activity and methanogenic microbial community remain unclear. In the current study, for two adjacent lakes at different trophic status, their methanogenesis potential in different seasons was evaluated using incubation experiments. The density, diversity, and community structure of methanogens were analyzed based on the mcrA gene. Correlation analysis and redundancy analysis were carried out to identify the environmental factors driving the variations of methanogenesis potential and methanogen community. The results showed that eutrophication could result in active methanogenesis with relatively high seasonal variance. The methanogenesis variation could be well explained by carbon input in association with algal growth, as well as the change of methanogen population density. With the dominance of Methanomicrobiales in both lakes, the hydrogenotrophic pathway had a major contribution to total methane production. The considerable proportion of Methanomassiliicocales in eutrophic lake implied that methylotrophic methanogenesis might be previously underestimated. These results added new insights towards methanogenesis process in eutrophic freshwater lakes. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, ZX; Chen, X; Xu, CY; Hong, Y; Hardy, J; Sun, ZH				Zhang, Zengxin; Chen, Xi; Xu, Chong-Yu; Hong, Yang; Hardy, Jill; Sun, Zhonghua			Examining the influence of river-lake interaction on the drought and water resources in the Poyang Lake basin	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												In recent years, the Poyang Lake basin is in a prolonged drought which has placed immense pressure on the water resources utilization. In this paper, we explore the spatial and temporal distributions of extreme droughts in the Poyang Lake basin by using the methods of SPI (Standardized Precipitation Index) and EOF (Empirical Orthogonal Function) for the period of 1956-2009, which are influenced by regional precipitation anomalies and river-lake interaction due to water impounding of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD). The results show that: (I) the Poyang Lake basin experienced six extreme droughts during the past 60 years, which lead to decreases in streamflow from five tributary rivers down to the Poyang Lake. The droughts in the 1960s and the 2000s were the most serious ones. However, there was an increasing trend of streamflow in the upper and middle Yangtze in the 1960s, and a decreasing trend appeared in the 2000s. The decline of streamflow in the upper Yangtze reaches has lowered the water level of lower Yangtze River which has-caused more outflow from the Poyang Lake to the Yangtze River; (2) the operation of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) has altered the seasonal pattern of flow regimes in the Poyang Lake and significantly reduced the water level in the lower Yangtze River during the TGD impounding period from late September to early November; and (3) the conjunction of extreme droughts in the Poyang lake and the upper Yangtze reaches coincided with the impounding of the TGD is the main cause of the low water level in the Poyang Lake. Although the impact of the recent droughts in the Poyang Lake and upper Yangtze reaches has played a crucial role in the low water level of Poyang lake, more attention should be paid to its sensitivity to the influence of the large dam-induced changes in the interaction between river and lake, particularly during impounding periods.

In this study, the occurrence, distribution, source, and human health risk assessment of 15 NPAHs and 16 PAHs were investigated in the surface water from 20 sampling sites of Lake Taihu during the dry, normal, and flood seasons of 2018. The Sigma PAH concentrations ranged from 255 to 7298 ng/L and the Sigma NPAH concentrations ranged from not-detected (ND) to 212 ng/L. Among the target analytes, 2-nitrofluorene (2-nFlu) was the predominant NPAH, with a detection frequency ranging from 85% to 90% and a maximum concentration of 56.2 ng/L. The three-ringed and four-ringed NPAHs and PAHs comprised the majority of the detected compounds. In terms of seasonal variation, the highest levels of the E NPAHs and EPAHs were in the dry season and flood season, respectively. Diagnostic ratio analysis indicated that the prime source of NPAHs was direct combustion, whereas in the case of PAHs the contribution was predominantly from a mixed pattern including pollution from unburned petroleum and petroleum combustion. The human health risk of NPAHs and PAHs was evaluated using a lifetime carcinogenic risk assessment model. The carcinogenic risk level of the targets ranged from 2.09 x 10(-7) to 5.75 x 10(-5) and some surface water samples posed a potential health risk.

B., Jr.			Tracking changes in nutrient delivery to western Lake Erie: Approaches to compensate for variability and trends in streamflow	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Tracking changes in stream nutrient inputs to Lake Erie over multidecadal time scales depends on the use of statistical methods that can remove the influence of year-to-year variability of streamflow but also explicitly consider the influence of long-term trends in streamflow. The methods introduced in this paper include an extended version of Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS) modeling that explicitly considers nonstationary streamflow by incorporating information on changes in the frequency distribution of daily measured streamflow (discharge) over time. Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) trends in annual flow-normalized fluxes (loads) at five long-term monitoring sites in the western Lake Erie drainage basin show increases of 109 to 322% over the period 1995 to 2015. About one-third of the increase appears attributable to increasing discharge trends, while the remaining two-thirds appears to be driven by changes in concentration versus discharge relationships reflecting higher concentrations for any given discharge during recent years. Trends in total phosphorus and three nitrogen parameters (total nitrogen, nitrate-nitrite, and total Kjeldahl nitrogen) at the 10 sites analyzed were much less pronounced, and commonly show decreases in concentration-discharge relationships accompanied by increases in discharge, resulting in little net change in total flux. Trends in monthly SRP fluxes and discharge, dissolved versus particulate fractions of nutrients, and N:P flux ratios were also evaluated. The methods described here provide tools to more clearly discern the effectiveness of nutrient-control strategies and can serve as ongoing measures of progress, or lack of progress, towards nutrient-reduction goals.

We conducted extensive campaigns in the watershed of Lake Taihu and made daily observations for three years in its two largest inflowing tributaries, River Dapu and River Yincun. We found higher DOC, bio-labile DOC (BDOC), and specific UV absorbance (SUVA(254)) levels in the northwestern inflowing regions compared with the remaining lake regions. DOC and BDOC increased during rainstorms in River Dapu, and DOC declined due to local dilution and BDOC increased during rainstorms in River Yincun. We found that rainstorms resulted in increased DOM absorbance a(350), SUVA(254), and humification index (HIX) and enhanced percentages of humic-like fluorescent components, %polycyclic condensed aromatic and %polyphenolic compounds as revealed from ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), while spectral slope (S275-295) and the percentages of protein-like C1 and C3 declined during rainstorms compared with other seasons. This can be explained by a combined flushing of catchment soil organic matter and household effluents. The annual inflows of DOC and BDOC to Lake Taihu were 1.15 +/- 0.18 x 10(4) t C yr(-1) and 0.23 +/- 0.06 x 104 t C yr(-1) from River Dapu and 2.92 +/- 0.42 x 103 t C yr(-1) and 0.53 +/- 0.07 x 10(3) t C yr(-1) from River Yincun, respectively, and the fluxes of DOC and BDOC from both rivers increased during rainstorms. We found an elevated frequency of heavy rainfall and rainstorms in the lake watershed during the past six decades. We conclude that an elevated input of terrestrial organic-rich DOM with concurrent high aromaticity and high bio-lability from inflowing rivers is likely to occur in a future wetter climate.

J	Bradley, BA				Bradley, Bethany A.			Remote detection of invasive plants: a review of spectral, textural and phenological approaches	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Remote sensing image analysis is increasingly being used as a tool for mapping invasive plant species. Resulting distribution maps can be used to target management of early infestations and to model future invasion risk. Remote identification of invasive plants based on differences in spectral signatures is the most common approach, typically using hyperspectral data. But several studies have found that textural and phenological differences are also effective approaches for identifying invasive plants. I review examples of remote detection of invasive plants based on spectral, textural and phenological analysis and highlight circumstances where the different approaches are likely to be most effective. I also review sources and availability of remotely sensed data that could be used for mapping and suggest field data collection approaches that would support the analysis of remotely sensed data. Remote mapping of biological invasions remains a relatively specialized research topic, but the distinct cover, morphology and/or seasonality of many invaded versus native ecosystems suggests that more species could be detected remotely. Remote sensing can sometimes support early detection and rapid response directly, however, accurately detecting small, nascent populations is a challenge. However, even maps of heavily infested areas can provide a valuable tool for risk assessment by increasing knowledge about temporal and spatial patterns and predictors of invasion.

Under such conditions, the introduction and proliferation of aquatic invasive alien species are more likely to occur. Hence, frequent surface water quality monitoring is required for aquatic ecosystem sustainability. The main objectives of the present study are to analyze the seasonal variation in the invasive plant species water hyacinth (Pontederia crassipes) and biogeochemical water quality parameters, i.e., chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and total suspended matter (TSM), and to examine their relationship in Lake Tana (Ethiopia) during a one-year study period (2020). Sentinel-2A/B satellite images are used to monitor water hyacinth expansion and Chl-a and TSM concentrations in the water. The Case 2 Regional Coast Colour processor (C2RCC) is used for atmospheric and sunglint correction over inland waters, while the Sen2Cor atmospheric processor is used to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for water hyacinth mapping. The water hyacinth cover and biomass are determined by NDVI values ranging from 0.60 to 0.95. A peak in cover and biomass is observed in October 2020, just a month after the peak of Chl-a (25.2 mg m(-3)) and TSM (62.5 g m(-3)) concentrations observed in September 2020 (end of the main rainy season). The influx of sediment and nutrient load from the upper catchment area during the rainy season could be most likely responsible for both Chl-a and TSM increased concentrations. This, in turn, created a fertile situation for water hyacinth proliferation in Lake Tana. Overall, the freely available Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and appropriate atmospheric correction processors are an emerging potent tool for inland water monitoring and management in large-scale regions under a global change scenario.

Specimens of the fishes (omnivorous/herbivorous and carnivorous) were collected along the Doce River channel and its affluent Guandu River, and in different lakes and coastal lagoons adjacent to the river channel, in the Espirito Santo State, Southeast of Brazil. Four sampling collections were carried out over two years (2018 to 2020, during dry and rainy seasons). For both trophic groups the biomarkers responses indicated physiological alterations related to metals exposure and showed strong seasonal variations. The principal component analysis and integrated biomarker response index showed that DNA damage and lipid peroxidation were more associated with dry season 2 (Sep/Oct 2019) and the oxidative damage in proteins, metallothioneins concentration and the activity of superoxide dismutase in the gills showed a greater association with rainy season 2 (Jan/Feb 2020). On the other hand, the enzymes of energy metabolism, catalase and histological damage in the liver and the gills, were more associated with the dry and rainy campaigns of the first year of monitoring. The multivariate approach also suggested a temporal intensification in the bioaccumulation of metals and biological effects in the lacustrine environments. Thus, these results demonstrate that the release of mineral residues from the rupture of the Fundao mine dam affects the health status of the fish from the Doce River basin, provoking metals bioaccumulation, hepatic and branchial damage in the fish besides inducing of enzyme activity related to metal contamination, even four years after the rupture.					; Gonçalves da Silva, Niumaique/CAJ-3544-2022; PIROVANI, JULIANA/AAI-4917-2021; Souza, Marta/E-4974-2013; de Martinez Gaspar Martins, Camila/J-2400-2013; Martins, Camila/J-2400-2013; Sandrini, Juliana/E-2893-2015; Pirovani, Juliana/AAI-4917-2021; Maraschi, Anieli/B-1364-2018; Zebral, Yuri/K-8358-2019; MARQUES, JOSEANE/ABB-5765-2020; Medeiros Damasceno, Eduardo/IZP-6705-2023; Costa, Patrícia/C-9520-2017	Souza, Marta Marques/0000-0001-5996-0055; PIROVANI, JULIANA/0000-0002-4157-6503; de Martinez Gaspar Martins, Camila/0000-0001-7084-9948; Goncalves da Silva, Niumaique/0000-0001-8068-9466; Marques, Joseane/0000-0001-7391-9980; Vieira, Carlos Eduardo/0009-0003-8408-356X; Maraschi, Anieli/0000-0001-8653-9709													0048-9697	1879-1026				AUG 1	2022	832								154878	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154878	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154878		APR 2022						35364171					WOS:000793407400004

This study sought to identify cultural factors and community processes that influence men's HIV testing uptake in the baseline year of an ongoing test-and-treat trial among 334,479 persons in eastern Africa (SEARCH, NCT#01864603). Data were collected using participant observation at mobile community health campaigns (CHCs) (n=28); focus group discussions (n=8 groups) with CHC participants; and in-depth interviews with care providers (n=50), leaders (n=32), and members (n=112) of eight communities in Kenya and Uganda. An 8-person research team defined analytical codes and iteratively refined them during data collection using grounded theoretical approaches, and textual data were coded using Atlas.ti software. Structural and cultural barriers, including men's mobility and gender norms valorizing risk-taking and discouraging health-seeking behavior, were observed, and contributed to men's lower participation in HIV testing relative to women. Men's labor opportunities often require extended absences from households: during planting season, men guarded fields from monkeys from dawn until nightfall; lake fishermen traveled long distances and circulated between beaches. Men often tested by proxy, believing their wives' HIV test results to be their status. Debates about HIV risks were vigorous, with many men questioning traditional masculine gender norms that enhanced risks. The promise of antiretroviral therapy (ART) to prolong health was a motivating factor for many men to participate in testing. Flexibility in operating hours of HIV testing including late evening and weekend times along with multiple convenient locations that moved were cited as facilitating factors enhancing male participating in HIV testing. Mobile testing reduced but did not eliminate barriers to men's participation in a large-scale test & treat effort. However, transformations in gender norms related to HIV testing and care-seeking are underway in eastern Africa and should be supported.

Reconciling the temperature dependence of respiration across timescales and ecosystem types	NATURE												Ecosystem respiration is the biotic conversion of organic carbon to carbon dioxide by all of the organisms in an ecosystem, including both consumers and primary producers. Respiration exhibits an exponential temperature dependence at the subcellular and individual levels(1), but at the ecosystem level respiration can be modified by many variables(2-4) including community abundance and biomass(5), which vary substantially among ecosystems(6). Despite its importance for predicting the responses of the biosphere to climate change, it is as yet unknown whether the temperature dependence of ecosystem respiration varies systematically between aquatic and terrestrial environments. Here we use the largest database of respiratory measurements yet compiled to show that the sensitivity of ecosystem respiration to seasonal changes in temperature is remarkably similar for diverse environments encompassing lakes, rivers, estuaries, the open ocean and forested and non-forested terrestrial ecosystems, with an average activation energy similar to that of the respiratory complex(3) (approximately 0.65 electronvolts (eV)). By contrast, annual ecosystem respiration shows a substantially greater temperature dependence across aquatic (approximately 0.65 eV) versus terrestrial ecosystems (approximately 0.32 eV) that span broad geographic gradients in temperature. Using a model(5) derived from metabolic theory(7), these findings can be reconciled by similarities in the biochemical kinetics of metabolism at the subcellular level, and fundamental differences in the importance of other variables besides temperature-such as primary productivity and allochthonous carbon inputs-on the structure of aquatic and terrestrial biota at the community level.

Thus, in this study, a retrieval algorithm was developed to predict chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) based on a large amount of in situ measurements and Landsat 8 remote sensing images. Random Forest (RF) machine learning was conducted to identify the relationship between environmental indicators (pH, turbidity, conductivity, total dissolved solids and water temperature), Chla, TN and TP. The results showed that the NIR/R Binomial algorithm for Chl-a estimation presented appreciable reliability with R2 of 0.7429, root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.2089 and mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of 15.33%. The water quality variation in the PRE showed a characteristic of overall improvement and regional deterioration with average concentrations of 7.28 mu g/L, 1.15 mg/L and 0.12 mg/L for Chl-a, TN, and TP respectively. Turbidity and pH were identified as the most important indicators to explain Chl-a (52.86%, 39.91%), TN (52.38%, 40.57%) and TP (55.23%, 40.03%) variation. Agricultural pollution was the main pollution source due to the intensive application of fertilizer and increased field size. Besides, land use patterns (e.g., increasing farmland but decreasing forest) greatly influenced water quality from 2010 to 2020. Moreover, light limitation caused by high turbidity reduced the algae productivity and further lowered the Chl-a concentration. The driving factors for regional water quality variations were anthropologically dominated and supplemented by climate change. This study improved the monitoring accuracy of regional water environment and provided quantitative early warning of water pollution events for environmental practitioners, so as to achieve long-term monitoring, precise pollution management and efficient water resources management.					; Lin, Wei/JDW-7809-2023; WANG, SHANSHAN/OKS-5896-2025	Dong, Yue/0000-0001-9508-315X; Lin, Wei/0000-0002-7092-7157; Fan, Fuqiang/0000-0002-7944-0695; LI, YU/0000-0002-6490-5672													0013-9351	1096-0953				DEC	2022	215		3						114380	10.1016/j.envres.2022.114380	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.114380		SEP 2022						36162468					WOS:000869025400002

However, accurate rainfall data with sufficient spatiotemporal distribution is inadequate in the Blue Nile Basin (Ribb watershed) due to uneven distribution of rain gauge networks. Advances in remote sensing science have provided alternative sources of rainfall data with high spatiotemporal resolution. But the accuracies of different satellite rainfall datasets are not uniform across space and time that need to be checked. The overarching objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of four satellite-based rainfall products [Tropical Applications of Meteorology using Satellite and ground-based observations (TAMSAT-v2.0 and v3.0), Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data version two (CHIRPS-v2.0), and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission version seven (TRMM-3643 v7.0)] in the data-scarce region of the Blue Nile Basin in Ethiopia. The evaluation was carried out through direct comparison with the observed rainfall and through simulation of annual water yield using InVEST model for monthly, seasonal, and annual time scales. In general, the results show that the performance of satellite rainfall differs in time scale, topography, and method of evaluation. CHIRPS v2.0 rainfall product shows good performance both at monthly (R-2 = 0.83) and annual (r = 0.85) time scales regardless of elevation. TRMM-3643 v7.0 well performed over the mountainous area, which makes it the best rainfall data than other products at seasonal time scale (r = 0.86). CHIRPS v2.0 and TAMSAT v3.0 are equally applicable to that of gauged rainfall data for annual water yield simulation (Bias = 1.01 and 1.08 respectively). The findings of this study indicated the best performance of CHIRPS v2.0 and TAMSAT v3.0 satellite rainfall products, and hence, these products can be used for water management and decision-making process, particularly in the data-scarce watersheds.

J	Isles, PDF				Isles, Peter D. F.			A random forest approach to improve estimates of tributary nutrient loading	WATER RESEARCH												Estimating constituent loads from discrete water quality samples coupled with stream discharge measurements is critical for management of freshwater resources. Nutrient loads calculated based on discharge-concentration relationships form the basis of government nutrient load targets and scientific studies of the response of receiving waters to external loads. In this study, a new model is developed using random forests and applied to estimate concentrations and loads of total phosphorus, dissolved phosphorus, total nitrogen, and chloride, using data from 17 tributaries to Lake Champlain monitored from 1992 to 2021. I benchmark this model against one of the most widespread models currently used to estimate nutrient loads, Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS). The random forest model outperformed both the base WRTDS model and an extension of the WRTDS model using Kalman filtering in the great majority of cases, likely due to the inclusion of rate-ofchange in discharge and antecedent discharge over different leading windows as predictors, and to the flexibility of the random forest to model predictor-response relationships. The random forest also had useful visualization capabilities which provided important process insights. WRTDS remains a useful model for many applications, but this study represents a promising new approach for load estimation which can be applied easily to existing datasets, and which is easy to customize for different applications.																			0043-1354	1879-2448				JAN 1	2024	248								120876	10.1016/j.watres.2023.120876	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2023.120876		NOV 2023						37984040					WOS:001119323100001

Methane emissions from contrasting urban freshwaters: Rates, drivers, and a whole-city footprint	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Global urbanization trends impose major alterations on surface waters. This includes impacts on ecosystem functioning that can involve feedbacks on climate through changes in rates of greenhouse gas emissions. The combination of high nutrient supply and shallow depth typical of urban freshwaters is particularly conducive to high rates of methane (CH4) production and emission, suggesting a potentially important role in the global CH4 cycle. However, there is a lack of comprehensive flux data from diverse urban water bodies, of information on the underlying drivers, and of estimates for whole cities. Based on measurements over four seasons in a total of 32 water bodies in the city of Berlin, Germany, we calculate the total CH4 emission from various types of surface waters of a large city in temperate climate at 2.6 +/- 1.7 Gg CH4/year. The average total emission was 219 +/- 490 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1). Water chemical variables were surprisingly poor predictors of total CH4 emissions, and proxies of productivity and oxygen conditions had low explanatory power as well, suggesting a complex combination of factors governing CH4 fluxes from urban surface waters. However, small water bodies (area <1 ha) typically located in urban green spaces were identified as emission hotspots. These results help constrain assessments of CH4 emissions from freshwaters in the world's growing cities, facilitating extrapolation of urban emissions to large areas, including at the global scale.					; Casper, Peter/B-7384-2011; Singer, Gabriel/JBR-8741-2023	Gessner, Mark O./0000-0003-2516-7416; Casper, Peter/0000-0002-5956-4674; Singer, Gabriel/0000-0002-7389-9788; Romero Gonzalez-Quijano, Clara/0000-0002-7343-5561; Herrero Ortega, Sonia/0000-0003-4561-501X													1354-1013	1365-2486				DEC	2019	25	12					4234	4243		10.1111/gcb.14799	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14799		SEP 2019						31411780					WOS:000485475200001

As a result of impounding of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), climate change and sand mining, the dry season of Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake (China's two largest freshwater lakes) came early after the TGD impoundment. It was the primary cause of the increasing need for sluice/dam construction to store water in the Lakes and attracted increasing attention. In this paper, we compared the landscape pattern between three hydrologic years with early dry season (EY) and three normal hydrologic years (NY) of each lake by remote sensing technology, to reveal the effect of early dry season on landscape pattern. The results showed that early dry season caused expanding of Phalaris to mudflat zone in Poyang Lake, while caused expanding of Carex to Phalaris zone and expanding of Phalaris to mudflat zone in Dongting Lake. In landscape level, there was no significant difference in landscape grain size, landscape grain shape, habitat connectivity and landscape diversity between EY and NY in the two lakes. While in habitat class level, there were significant changes in area of mudflat and Phalaris and grain size of mudflat in Poyang Lake, and in area of Carex, grain size of Phalaris and grain shape of Carex and Phalaris in Dongting Lake. These changes will impact migrating birds of East Asian and migratory fishes of Yangtze River. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Parsons, CT; Rezanezhad, F; O'Connell, DW; Van Cappellen, P				Parsons, Chris T.; Rezanezhad, Fereidoun; O'Connell, David W.; Van Cappellen, Philippe			Sediment phosphorus speciation and mobility under dynamic redox conditions	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Anthropogenic nutrient enrichment has caused phosphorus (P) accumulation in many freshwater sediments, raising concerns that internal loading from legacy P may delay the recovery of aquatic ecosystems suffering from eutrophication. Benthic recycling of P strongly depends on the redox regime within surficial sediment. In many shallow environments, redox conditions tend to be highly dynamic as a result of, among others, bioturbation by macrofauna, root activity, sediment resuspension and seasonal variations in bottom-water oxygen (O-2) concentrations. To gain insight into the mobility and biogeochemistry of P under fluctuating redox conditions, a suspension of sediment from a hypereutrophic freshwater marsh was exposed to alternating 7-day periods of purging with air and nitrogen gas (N-2), for a total duration of 74 days, in a bioreactor system. We present comprehensive data time series of bulk aqueous-and solid-phase chemistry, solid-phase phosphorus speciation and hydrolytic enzyme activities demonstrating the mass balanced redistribution of P in sediment during redox cycling. Aqueous phosphate concentrations remained low (similar to 2.5 mu M) under oxic conditions due to sorption to iron(III) oxyhydroxides. During anoxic periods, once nitrate was depleted, the reductive dissolution of iron(III) oxyhydroxides released P. However, only 4.5% of the released P accumulated in solution while the rest was redistributed between the MgCl2 and NaHCO3 extractable fractions of the solid phase. Thus, under the short redox fluctuations imposed in the experiments, P remobilization to the aqueous phase remained relatively limited. Orthophosphate predominated at all times during the experiment in both the solid and aqueous phase. Combined P monoesters and diesters accounted for between 9 and 16% of sediment particulate P. Phosphatase activities up to 2.4mmol h(-1) kg(-1) indicated the potential for rapid mineralization of organic P (P-O), in particular during periods of aeration when the activity of phosphomonoesterases was 37% higher than under N-2 sparging. The results emphasize that the magnitude and timing of internal P loading during periods of anoxia are dependent on both P redistribution within sediments and bottom-water nitrate concentrations.					; Parsons, Chris/AAW-4028-2020; Van Cappellen, Philippe/A-2906-2013	O'Connell, David William/0000-0002-1974-8145; Rezanezhad, Fereidoun/0000-0002-9608-8005; Parsons, Chris/0000-0002-6003-7716; 													1726-4170	1726-4189				JUL 27	2017	14	14					3585	3602		10.5194/bg-14-3585-2017	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-3585-2017													WOS:000406406500003

In this study, the differences in sources, biogeochemical characteristics, and fates of CDOM between the littoral zones of eutrophic lakes Taihu (LLT; frequently occurring algal blooms and longer lake residence time) and Hongze (LLH; no obvious algal blooms and shorter residence time) were compared during the algal bloom season using ultraviolet-visible spectra and excitation and emission matrix spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis. Three humic-like fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) components (C1, C3, and C4) and one protein-like component (C2) were identified. Results showed that FDOM components were dominated by protein-like fluorescent substances in LLT, and humic-like materials in LLH, respectively. The CDOM in LLT had a lower relative aromaticity and molecular weight, humification degree and a higher autotrophic productivity because of algal blooms. Furthermore, CDOM depletion rates in LLT were higher than those in LLH due to a longer lake residence time in LLT. In addition, CDOM shifted from high molecular weight to low molecular weight as the humification degree decreased during the CDOM depletion process. This comparative study showed that algal blooms and lake residence time were the significant factors for distinguishing characteristics of CDOM between littoral zones of shallow lakes on a similar trophic level. This study provides field-based knowledge for remote sensing CDOM measurement and serves as a reference for lakeshore aquatic environmental management.

Season-Long Monitoring of the Brown Marmorated Stink Bug (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) Throughout the United States Using Commercially Available Traps and Lures	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												Reliable monitoring of the invasive Halyomorpha halys abundance, phenology and geographic distribution is critical for its management. Halyomorpha halys adult and nymphal captures on clear sticky traps and in black pyramid traps were compared in 18 states across the Great Lakes, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Pacific Northwest and Western regions of the United States. Traps were baited with commercial lures containing the H. halys pheromone and synergist, and deployed at field sites bordering agricultural or urban locations with H. halys host plants. Nymphal and adult captures in pyramid traps were greater than those on sticky traps, but captures were positively correlated between the two trap types within each region and during the early-, mid- and late season across all sites. Sites were further classified as having a low, moderate or high relative H. halys density and again showed positive correlations between captures for the two trap types for nymphs and adults. Among regions, the greatest adult captures were recorded in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic on pyramid and sticky traps, respectively, with lowest captures recorded in the West. Nymphal captures, while lower than adult captures, were greatest in the Southeast and lowest in the West. Nymphal and adult captures were, generally, greatest during July-August and September-October, respectively. Trapping data were compared with available phenological models showing comparable population peaks at most locations. Results demonstrated that sticky traps offer a simpler alternative to pyramid traps, but both can be reliable tools to monitor H. halys in different geographical locations with varying population densities throughout the season.					; Wiman, Nik/J-4998-2019	Hamilton, George/0000-0001-7680-8047; Guedot, Christelle/0000-0002-6558-9886; Hutchison, William D./0000-0001-9605-2996; Toews, Michael D./0000-0003-1880-5926; Blaauw, Brett/0000-0001-6165-2713; Walgenbach, James/0000-0001-9454-3943													0022-0493	1938-291X				FEB	2020	113	1					159	171		10.1093/jee/toz240	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toz240								31502635					WOS:000515119000018

Although MC pollution in natural waters of China has been reported, a systematic analysis of the risk of MCs in Chinese lakes and reservoirs is still lacking. In this study, the distribution, trend, and risk of MCs in Chinese lakes and reservoirs were comprehensively revealed through meta-analysis for the first time. The results showed that MC pollution occurrence in numerous lakes and reservoirs have been reported, with MC pollution being distributed in the waters of 15 provinces in China. For lakes, the maximum mean total MC (TMC) and dissolved MC (DMC) concentrations occurred in Lake Dianchi (23.06 mu g/L) and Lake Taihu (1.00 mu g/L), respectively. For reservoirs, the maximum mean TMC and DMC concentrations were detected in Guanting (4.31 mu g/L) and Yanghe reservoirs (0.98 mu g/L), respectively. The TMC concentrations in lakes were significantly higher than those in the reservoirs (p < 0.05), but no difference was observed in the DMC between the two water bodies (p > 0.05). Correlation analysis showed that the total phosphorus concentrations, pH, transparency, chlorophyll a, and dissolved oxygen were significantly related to the DMC in lakes and reservoirs. The ecological risks of DMC in Chinese lakes and reservoirs were generally at low levels, but high or moderate ecological risks of TMC had occurred in several waters, which were not negligible. Direct drinking water and consumption of aquatic products in several MC -polluted lakes and reservoirs may pose human health risks. This study systematically analyzed the pollution and risk of MCs in lakes and reservoirs nationwide in China and pointed out the need for further MC research and management in waters.

The data originated from 15 rain gauges in the Mara region (1965-2015) and one station in Narok Town (1913-2015), in Kenya's Narok County. This is the first comprehensive and most detailed analysis of changes in rainfall in the region of its kind. Our results do not support the current predictions of the International Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) of very likely increases of rainfall over parts of Eastern Africa. The dry season rainfall component increased during 1935-2015 but annual rainfall decreased during 1962-2015 in Narok Town. Monthly rainfall was more stable and higher in the Mara than in Narok Town, likely because the Mara lies closer to the high-precipitation areas along the shores of Lake Victoria. Predominantly deterministic and persistent interannual cycles and extremely stable seasonal rainfall oscillations characterize rainfall in the Mara and Narok regions. The frequency of severe droughts increased and floods intensified in the Mara but droughts became less frequent and less severe in Narok Town. The timings of extreme droughts and floods coincided with significant periodicity in rainfall oscillations, implicating strong influences of global atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns on regional rainfall variability. These changing rainfall patterns have implications for animal population dynamics. The increase in dry season rainfall during 1935-2015 possibly counterbalanced the impacts of resource scarcity generated by the declining annual rainfall during 1965-2015 in Narok Town. However, the increasing rainfall extremes in the Mara can be expected to create conditions conducive to outbreaks of infectious animal diseases and reduced vegetation quality for herbivores, particularly when droughts and floods persist over multiple years. The more extreme wet season rainfall may also alter herbivore space use, including migration patterns.

The paddy was cultivated with rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Wuyunjing 7) under a conventional water regime. Soil emissions of CH4 and N2O were monitored with a closed chamber method throughout the whole rice growing season (WRGS) at 10 day intervals. Biochar amendments of 10 t ha(-1) and 40 t ha(-1) increased rice yields by 12% and 14% in unfertilized soils, and by 8.8% and 12.1% in soils with N fertilization, respectively. Total soil CH4-C emissions were increased by 34% and 41% in soils amended with biochar at 40 t ha(-1) compared to the treatments without biochar and with or without N fertilization, respectively. However, total N2O emissions were sharply decreased by 40-51% and by 21-28%, respectively in biochar amended soils with or without N fertilization. The emission factor (EF) was reduced from 0.0042 kg N2O-N kg(-1) N fertilized with no biochar to 0.0013 kg N2O-N kg(-1) N fertilized with biochar at 40 t ha(-1). The results show that biochar significantly increased rice yields and decreased N2O emission, but increased total CH4 emissions. Summary calculations based on this experiment data set provide a basis for estimating the potential reductions in GHG emissions that may be achieved by incorporating biochar into rice paddy soils in south-eastern China.

Bacteria and Archaea undoubtedly represent the most abundant cellular life forms on Earth and past estimates of viral numbers (represented mainly by viruses infecting prokaryotes) have indicated abundances at least one order of magnitude higher than that of their cellular hosts. Such dominance has been reflected most often by the virus-to-prokaryote ratio (VPR), proposed as a proxy for the relationship between viral and prokaryotic communities. VPR values have been discussed in the literature to express viral numerical dominance (or absence of it) over their cellular hosts, but the ecological meaning and interpretation of this ratio has remained somewhat nebulous or contradictory. We gathered data from 210 publications (and additional unpublished data) on viral ecology with the aim of exploring VPR. The results are presented in three parts: the first consists of an overview of the minimal, maximal and calculated average VPR values in an extensive variety of different environments. Results indicate that VPR values fluctuate over six orders of magnitude, with variations observed within each ecosystem. The second part investigates the relationship between VPR and other indices, in order to assess whether VPR can provide insights into virus-host relationships. A positive relationship was found between VPR and viral abundance (VA), frequency of visibly infected cells (FVIC), burst size (BS), frequency of lysogenic cells (FLC) and chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration. An inverse relationship was detected between VPR and prokaryotic abundance (PA) (in sediments), prokaryotic production (PP) and virus-host contact rates (VCR) as well as salinity and temperature. No significant relationship was found between VPR and viral production (VP), fraction of mortality from viral lysis (FMVL), viral decay rate (VDR), viral turnover (VT) or depth. Finally, we summarize our results by proposing two scenarios in two contrasting environments, based on current theories on viral ecology as well as the present results. We conclude that since VPR fluctuates in every habitat for different reasons, as it is linked to a multitude of factors related to virus-host dynamics, extreme caution should be used when inferring relationships between viruses and their hosts. Furthermore, we posit that the VPR is only useful in specific, controlled conditions, e. g. for the monitoring of fluctuations in viral and host abundance over time.

This enhanced capability facilitates a comprehensive understanding of drought conditions and early warnings for extreme drought events. In this study, multiple satellite datasets, including Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) precipitation dataset, and the Global Land the Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) dataset, were used to conduct an innovative in-depth characteristic analysis and identification of the extreme drought event in the Poyang Lake Basin (PLB) in 2022. Furthermore, the drought characteristics were also supplemented by processing the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image data to obtain lake water area changes and integrating in situ water level data as well as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation index dataset, which provided additional instances of utilizing multi-source remote sensing satellite data for feature analysis on extreme drought events. The extreme drought event in 2022 was identified by the detection of non-seasonal negative anomalies in terrestrial water storage derived from the GRACE and GLDAS datasets. The Mann-Kendall (M-K) test results for water levels indicated a significant abrupt decrease around July 2022, passing a significance test with a 95% confidence level, which further validated the reliability of our finding. The minimum area of Poyang Lake estimated by SAR data, corresponding to 814 km2, matched well with the observed drought characteristics. Additionally, the evident lower vegetation index compared to other years also demonstrated the severity of the drought event. The utilization of these diverse datasets and their validation in this study can contribute to achieving a multi-dimensional monitoring of drought characteristics and the establishment of more robust drought models.					; Zhong, Yulong/X-6893-2019; Wu, Yunlong/LCD-7795-2024; WU, Yunlong/LCD-7795-2024	Zhang, Yi/0000-0003-1006-6372; Xu, Guodong/0009-0003-1948-4973; Wu, Yunlong/0000-0002-5487-5078; liu, su lan/0009-0009-3013-3190; Zhong, Yulong/0000-0002-6172-2598														2072-4292				NOV	2023	15	21							5125	10.3390/rs15215125	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15215125													WOS:001103013900001

Current research of WL prediction mainly focuses on gauged sites and further investigation into effective approaches to predict WL in ungauged rivers, is urgently required. We developed a method for forecasting WL in ungauged sites of rivers by integrating hydrodynamic model and deep learning model. Specifically, two integration modes were included. One mode comprised deep learning model to forecast boundary conditions and hydrodynamic model to forecast WL in ungauged sites (DH mode). The other mode comprised hydrodynamic model to simulate WL in ungauged sites and deep learning model to forecast WL (HD mode). These approaches were tested in a section of the Yangtze River. The results showed that the hydrodynamic model can achieve high simulation accuracy of WL for the entire river, providing the foundation for WL prediction in ungauged sites by the two modes. The HD mode performed better than the DH mode with a satisfactory validation accuracy of the hydrodynamic model. Both modes, however, provided reliable WL prediction results, the forecasting accuracy of the two modes showed further improvement in the dry season, which is important in terms of ship navigation safety. Our proposed method, therefore, has great potential as a scientific reference for forecasting of WL in ungauged sites of rivers and can also be applied for forecasting of other inland water hydrological variables.

Because river damming alters hydraulic residence time and water depth, the hydraulic load (i.e., the ratio of the mean water depth to the residence time) was hypothesized to control N2O emissions from dam reservoirs. To test this hypothesis, we investigated N2O fluxes and related parameters in the cascade reservoirs along the Wujiang River in Southwest China. The N2O fluxes showed obvious temporal and spatial variations, ranging from -7.86 to 337.22 mu mol m(-2) d(-1), with an average of 12.76 mu mol m(-2) d(-1). Nitrification was the main pathway of N2O production in these reservoirs, and seasonal dissolved oxygen (DO) stratification played an important role in regulating the N2O production. The reservoir N2O flux had a significant negative logarithmic relationship with the hydraulic load, suggesting its control of the N2O emission. This was because the hydraulic load was a prerequisite for regulating the nitrification-denitrification and the DO stratification in the dam reservoirs. This empirical relationship will help to estimate the contribution of reservoir N2O emissions to global GHGs.

However, seasonal changes in bacterial communities of river sediments with different pollution levels and sources have not been clear yet. In this study, we collected sediment samples during the dry season, wet season and level season from 40 sites with various pollution sources in three inflow rivers (Fengle-Hangbu River, Nanfei River and Zhegao River) of Chaohu Lake. Bacterial community compositions were determined based on high-throughput sequencing. The 'Bioenv' in the R package 'Vegan' and redundancy analysis was used to explore the influence of environmental factors on the bacterial community in the river sediments. Results showed that a significant deviation in bacterial communities was found among seasons and rivers. In addition, seasonal dynamics had a greater impact on shaping bacterial communities than rivers with different pollution sources. A higher diversity was found in the wet season as compared to the other seasons. The bacterial diversity was negatively correlated with nutrients (OM, TN, NH4+, IP, OP and TP) and metals (Cu and Zn). Bacterial communities were more sensitive to heavy metals pressure than nutrients. We also concluded that heavy metals (Cu and Cd) were the key contributing factors in explaining variations in bacterial communities. This study provided a valuable reference for assessing ecological stress.

Jeremy; Loftin, Keith A.; Meredith, Andrew			Evaluation of a satellite-based cyanobacteria bloom detection algorithm using field-measured microcystin data	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Widespread occurrence of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) and the associated health effects from potential cyanotoxin exposure has led to a need for systematic and frequent screening and monitoring of lakes that are used as recreational and drinking water sources. Remote sensing-based methods are often used for synoptic and frequent monitoring of CyanoHABs. In this study, one such algorithm - a sub-component of the Cyanobacteria Index called the CIcyano, was validated for effectiveness in identifying lakes with toxinproducing blooms in 11 states across the contiguous United States over 11 bloom seasons (2005-2011, 2016-2019). Amatchup data setwas created using satellite data fromMEdiumResolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and Ocean Land Colour Imager (OLCI), and nearshore, field-measured Microcystins (MCs) data as a proxy of CyanoHAB presence. While the satellite sensors cannot detect toxins, MCs are used as the indicator of health risk, and as a confirmation of cyanoHAB presence. MCs are also the most common laboratory measurement made by managers during CyanoHABs. Algorithm performance was evaluated by its ability to detect CyanoHAB `Presence' or 'Absence', where the bloom is confirmed by the presence of the MCs. With same-day matchups, the overall accuracy of CyanoHAB detection was found to be 84% with precision and recall of 87 and 90% for bloom detection. Overall accuracy was expected to be between 77% and 87% (95% confidence) based on a bootstrapping simulation. These findings demonstrate that CIcyano has utility for synoptic and routine monitoring of potentially toxic cyanoHABs in lakes across the United States. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

Concurrent warming and browning eliminate cold- water fish habitat in many temperate lakes	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Cold- water species in temperate lakes face two simultaneous climate- driven ecosystem changes: warming and browning of their waters. Browning refers to reduced transparency arising from increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which absorbs solar energy near the surface. It is unclear whether the net effect is mitigation or amplification of climate warming impacts on suitable oxythermal habitat ( 20 degrees C, 5 mgO/L) for cold- loving species because browning expands the vertical distribution of both cool water and oxygen depletion. We analyzed long- term trends and high- frequency sensor data from browning lakes in New York's Adirondack region to assess the contemporary status of summertime habitat for lacustrine brook trout. Across two decades, surface temperatures increased twice as fast and bottom dissolved oxygen declined >180% faster than average trends for temperate lakes. We identify four lake categories based on oxythermal habitat metrics: constrained, squeezed, overheated, and buffered. In most of our study lakes, trout face either seasonal loss (7 of 15) or dramatic restriction (12 to 21% of the water column; 5 of 15) of suitable habitat. These sobering statistics reflect rapid upward expansion of oxygen depletion in lakes with moderate or high DOC relative to compression of heat penetration. Only in very clear lakes has browning potentially mitigated climate warming. Applying our findings to extensive survey data suggests that decades of browning have reduced oxythermal refugia in most Adirondack lakes. We conclude that joint warming and browning may preclude self- sustaining cold- water fisheries in many temperate lakes; hence, oxythermal categorization is essential to guide triage strategies and management interventions.					; Jane, Stephen/D-6659-2011	McIntyre, Peter/0000-0003-1809-7552; Jirka, Kurt/0009-0008-6751-3296; Randall, Eileen A./0009-0007-6583-3555; Jane, Stephen/0000-0003-2968-359X; Larrick, Siena/0009-0000-0861-5139													0027-8424	1091-6490				JAN 9	2024	121	2							e2306906120	10.1073/pnas.2306906120	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2306906120								38165940					WOS:001167918100006

This study aims to control SWI due to the rise in sea levels in three climate regions: (i) humid and wet regions using storage dams at different heads and recharge ponds, (ii) hyper-arid and arid regions using physical barriers and wastewater treatment aquifer, brackish water abstraction, and desalination (TRAD) method, and (iii) semi-arid and semi-humid regions using a combination of flooding water recharge well-field and cut-off wall. The study was developed using the world benchmark problem of Henry's problem and Biscayne aquifer in the Cutler Ridge area near Deering Estate, Florida, USA. The finite-difference code SEAWAT was used in numerical simulations. The numerical results indicated that increasing the artificial recharge lake capacity minimizes the SWI in humid and wet regions with a high level of flooding. Moreover, the intrusion is mitigated using physical barriers and the TRAD method for hyper-arid and arid regions. Combining physical barriers during dry seasons and recharge wells for wet seasons resulted in suitable measures to managed the SWI in semi-arid and semi-humid regions. Finally, the best strategy to mitigate the SWI and minimize the desalination costs depends on the precipitation rates. Therefore, the methodology applied to this study represents a valuable tool in order to select the best method based on the climate conditions and particularly the precipitation intensity to increase the water budget in freshwater aquifers.					; Straface, Salvatore/AET-5365-2022; Kuriqi, Alban/C-2913-2015; Abd-Elaty, Ismail/AAI-9193-2021	Straface, Salvatore/0000-0003-1081-6049; Kuriqi, Alban/0000-0001-7464-8377; 													0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2021	171								106382	10.1016/j.ecoleng.2021.106382	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2021.106382		AUG 2021											WOS:000694948100009

Concentrations of different forms of P and nitrogen (N) in surface and interstitial water, contents of carbon (C), N, P and iron (Fe) compounds as well as related extracellular enzymatic activities, phosphorus sorption, abundance of phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria (PSB), total and specific (containing phosphatase gene) microbial community composition in sediments were analyzed. In lakes with macrophyte dominance, P supply pathway from sediment to water column was blocked. In lakes being early period of regime shifting from macrophyte to algae, exogenous P input was the main P supply mode. In lakes being later period of regime shifting from macrophyte to algae, organic P hydrolysis and calcium-bound P dissociation driven by PSB contributed greatly to P regeneration, which was continuous and trickling. In this process, rapid C and N cycles fueled P regeneration. In lakes with algal dominance, given the significantly higher iron-bound P (Fe(OOH)similar to P), equilibriums phosphorus concentration and dehydrogenase activity, the main P regeneration pathway might be the desorption of Fe(OOH)similar to P driven by anoxia, showing the seasonal and pulsed characteristics. In addition, during the process of regime shift from macrophyte to algae, the dominant algal species switched from cyanobacteria to Chlorophyta. P-solubilizing microorganisms correlated with environmental factors, suggesting the coupling of multiple nutrient cycles, especially C, N, P, oxygen (O) and Fe, could effectively increase the pathways diversification and the strength of P regeneration.

Its existence in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) and the level of synchronicity with the NH is still a matter of debate. Here we present a palaeotemperature synthesis for South America encompassing the past 1500 years based on multiproxy data from 76 published land and marine sites. The data sets have been thoroughly graphically correlated and the MCA trends palaeoclimatologically mapped. The vast majority of all South American land sites suggest a warm MCA. Andean vegetation zones moved upslope, glaciers retreated, biological productivity in high altitude lakes increased, the duration of cold season ice cover on Andean lakes shortened, and trees produced thicker annual rings. Similar MCA warming occurred in coastal seas, except in the year-round upwelling zones of Peru, northern Chile and Cabo Frio (Brazil) where upwelling processes intensified during the MCA due to changes in winds and ocean currents. MCA warming in South America and the NH appears to have occurred largely synchronous, probably reaching comparable intensities. Future studies will have to address major MCA data gaps that still exist outside the Andes in the central and eastern parts of the continent. The most likely key drivers for the medieval climate change are multicentennial Pacific and Atlantic ocean cycles, probably linked to solar forcing.					; Gałka, Mariusz/ABB-1744-2020	Bamonte, Florencia Paula/0000-0001-9618-7022; Galka, Mariusz/0000-0001-8906-944X; 													1040-6182	1873-4553				MAR 1	2019	508						70	87		10.1016/j.quaint.2018.10.041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2018.10.041													WOS:000464133900007

To better understand the causes of lake decline, especially the abnormal low water levels in the dry season, we investigated channel changes using surveyed and remote sensing data and hence the increasing lake discharge ability and the resulting drop of water level of the lake. The results show that intensive sand mining resulted in a wider and deeper outflow channel for Poyang Lake. The discharge ability of Poyang Lake into the Yangtze River at low water levels has increased to 1.5-2 times the values before the initiation of extensive sand mining. This allows the lake to drain quickly and reach a lower water level than would otherwise have occurred. Higher discharge potential increases drought risk in Poyang Lake, particularly under the superimposed effects of regional rainfall anomalies and the water storage of dams. In response to potential low lake levels, the prohibition of sand mining should be given priority in lake management planning as opposed to damming the lake. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Distribution and seasonal evolution of supraglacial lakes on Shackleton Ice Shelf, East Antarctica	CRYOSPHERE												Supraglacial lakes (SGLs) enhance surface melting and can flex and fracture ice shelves when they grow and subsequently drain, potentially leading to ice shelf disintegration. However, the seasonal evolution of SGLs and their influence on ice shelf stability in East Antarctica remains poorly understood, despite some potentially vulnerable ice shelves having high densities of SGLs. Using optical satellite imagery, air temperature data from climate reanalysis products and surface melt predicted by a regional climate model, we present the first long-term record (2000-2020) of seasonal SGL evolution on Shackleton Ice Shelf, which is Antarctica's northernmost remaining ice shelf and buttresses Denman Glacier, a major outlet of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. In a typical melt season, we find hundreds of SGLs with a mean area of 0.02 km(2), a mean depth of 0.96m and a mean total meltwater volume of 7.45 x 10(6) m(3). At their most extensive, SGLs cover a cumulative area of 50.7 km(2) and are clustered near to the grounding line, where densities approach 0.27 km(2) km(-2). Here, SGL development is linked to an albedo-lowering feedback associated with katabatic winds, together with the presence of blue ice and exposed rock. Although below-average seasonal (December-January-February, DJF) temperatures are associated with below-average peaks in total SGL area and volume, warmer seasonal temperatures do not necessarily result in higher SGL areas and volumes. Rather, peaks in total SGL area and volume show a much closer correspondence with short-lived high-magnitude snowmelt events. We therefore suggest seasonal lake evolution on this ice shelf is instead more sensitive to snowmelt intensity associated with katabatic-wind-driven melting. Our analysis provides important constraints on the boundary conditions of supraglacial hydrology models and numerical simulations of ice shelf stability.

Tiaoxi River is one of the main rivers connected to this lake and contributes >60% of the source water. Taihu Lake has been facing various environmental issues; therefore, it is important to study the water quality of its inflow rivers. This study aimed to evaluate the physico-chemical and microbiological characteristics of Tiaoxi River and to determine the spatial and seasonal variations in the water quality. Water samples were collected from 25 locations across the Tiaoxi River in three seasons in 2014-2015. Fourteen water quality parameters including multiple nutrients and indicator bacteria were assessed, and the data analyzed by multivariate statistical analyses. The physico-chemical analysis showed high levels (>1 mg/L) of total nitrogen (TN) in all locations for all seasons. Total phosphorus (TP), nitrite-N (NO2-N), and ammonium-N (NH4-N) exceeded the acceptable limits in some locations and fecal coliform counts were high (>250 CFU/100 mL) in 15 locations. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed that the sampling sites could be grouped into three clusters based on water quality, which were categorized as low, moderate, and high pollution areas. Principal component analysis (PCA) applied to the entire dataset identified four principal components which explained 83% of the variation; pH, conductivity, TP, and NO3-N were found to be the key parameters responsible for variations in water quality. The overall results indicated that some of the sampling locations in the Tiaoxi River are heavily contaminated with pollutants from various sources which can be correlated with land use patterns and anthropogenic activities.

Drought-induced water-level reduction favors cyanobacteria blooms in tropical shallow lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Many arid and semiarid regions are likely to become warmer and drier by the end of this century, due to human-induced climate change. We hypothesize that a reduction in water level caused by droughts will aggravate eutrophication, leading to higher cyanobacteria biomass and dominance in tropical regions. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed physical and chemical variables and plankton communities of 40 man-made lakes in warm semiarid northeastern Brazil at the end of the wet and dry seasons. We also constructed a predictive model of cyanobacteria biovolume in these lakes. The lakes had significantly lower water volume, transparency, and CO2 concentrations but higher water temperature, water column stability, electrical conductivity, pH, suspended solids, ammonium, total nitrogen concentrations, bacteria biomass, phytoplankton biomass, and cyanobacteria biomass and dominance in the dry than in the wet season. Our regression model suggested that cyanobacteria biovolume was positively related to water column stability, pH, and total nitrogen and negatively related to water transparency and concentrations of inorganic suspended solids. These results suggest that the projected warmer and drier climate in the future will reduce water quantity and quality of man-made lakes in the region, increasing the risks of salinization, anoxia, eutrophication, and cyanobacteria blooms.					de Vasconcelos, Francisco/C-1642-2014; Attayde, José/C-4009-2015; Brasil, Jandeson/P-4815-2014; Huszar, Vera/J-7126-2012	Rivera de Vasconcelos, Francisco/0000-0002-2327-9716; Attayde, Jose/0000-0002-8372-4172; Huszar, Vera/0000-0002-8096-1404													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2016	770	1					145	164		10.1007/s10750-015-2578-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-015-2578-5													WOS:000372555100011
J	Herndon, K; Muench, R; Cherrington, E; Griffin, R				Herndon, Kelsey; Muench, Rebekke; Cherrington, Emil; Griffin, Robert			An Assessment of Surface Water Detection Methods for Water Resource Management in the Nigerien Sahel	SENSORS												Water is a scarce, but essential resource in the Sahel. Rainfed ephemeral ponds and lakes that dot the landscape are necessary to the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and pastoralists who rely on these resources to irrigate crops and hydrate cattle. The remote location and dispersed nature of these water bodies limits typical methods of monitoring, such as with gauges; fortunately, remote sensing offers a quick and cost-effective means of regularly measuring surface water extent in these isolated regions. Dozens of operational methods exist to use remote sensing to identify waterbodies, however, their performance when identifying surface water in the semi-arid Sahel has not been well-documented and the limitations of these methods for the region are not well understood. Here, we evaluate two global dynamic surface water datasets, fifteen spectral indices developed to classify surface water extent, and three simple decision tree methods created specifically to identify surface water in semi-arid environments. We find that the existing global surface water datasets effectively minimize false positives, but greatly underestimate the presence and extent of smaller, more turbid water bodies that are essential to local livelihoods, an important limitation in their use for monitoring water availability. Three of fifteen spectral indices exhibited both high accuracy and threshold stability when evaluated over different areas and seasons. The three simple decision tree methods had mixed performance, with only one having an overall accuracy that compared to the best performing spectral indices. We find that while global surface water datasets may be appropriate for analysis at the global scale, other methods calibrated to the local environment may provide improved performance for more localized water monitoring needs.

The impacts of warming on rapidly retreating high-altitude, low-latitude glaciers and ice core-derived climate records	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Alpine glaciers in the low- and mid-latitudes respond more quickly than large polar ice sheets to changes in temperature, precipitation, cloudiness, humidity, and radiation. Many high-altitude glaciers are monitored by ground observations, aerial photography, and satellite-borne sensors. Regardless of latitude and elevation, nearly all nonpolar glaciers and ice caps are undergoing mass loss, which compromises the records of past climate preserved within them. Almost without exception, the retreat of these ice fields is persistent, and a very important driver is the recent warming of the tropical troposphere and oceans. Here we present data on the decrease in the surface area of four glaciers from low- to mid-latitude mountainous regions: the Andes of Peru and northern Bolivia, equatorial east Africa, equatorial Papua, Indonesia, and the western Tibetan Plateau. Climate records based on oxygen isotopic ratios (delta O-18) measured in ice cores drilled from several glaciers in these regions reveal that the records from elevations below similar to 6000 m above sea level have been substantially modified by seasonal melting and the movement of meltwater through porous upper firn layers. Fortunately, delta O-18 records recovered from higher altitude sites still contain well-preserved seasonal variations to the surface; however, the projected increase in the rate of atmospheric warming implies that climate records from higher elevation glaciers will eventually also be degraded. A long-term ice core collection program on the Quelccaya ice cap in Peru, Earth's largest tropical ice cap, illustrates that the deterioration of its climate record is concomitant with the increase in mid-troposphere temperatures. The melting ice and resulting growth of proglacial lakes presents an imminent hazard to nearby communities. The accelerating melting of glaciers, if sustained, ensures the eventual loss of unique and irreplaceable climate histories, as well as profound economic, agricultural, and cultural impacts on local communities.					; Mosley-Thompson, Ellen/Z-2100-2018	Porter, Stacy/0000-0002-9585-1523; Valdivia Corrales, Gustavo/0000-0001-7176-3484; 													0921-8181	1872-6364				AUG	2021	203								103538	10.1016/j.gloplacha.2021.103538	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2021.103538		JUN 2021											WOS:000670281800003

A synchronized examination of lake and glacier mass variations there has not previously been conducted, which has limited the understanding of the lake water balance and the hydrologic cycle in the region. In this study, we comprehensively examine lake area and volume, and glacier mass changes using multi-sensor satellite data. We find that lake expansion in the northwestern Tibetan Plateau was more robust from 1976 to 2018 when compared to other regions of the plateau, especially for the glacier-fed and endorheic lakes. Lake volume changes show that most of the lakes had an increase in water volume, particularly in 20002018 with a total water storage gain of similar to 28.6 Gt. By using high-resolution KH-9 and TanDEM-X data, we observe that the glacier surface elevation of the western Kunlun Mountains had a slight thinning rate of -0.07 +/- 0.16 m/yr in 1973-2000, but a positive rate of 0.002 +/- 0.003 m/yr in 2000-2018. The heterogeneous pattern of glacier elevation changes between the north (N) and south (S) slopes are revealed, i.e. -0.02 +/- 0.01 m/yr (N) against -0.12 +/- 0.03 m/yr (S) in 1973-2000 and - 0.05 +/- 0.02 m/yr (N) against 0.06 +/- 0.02 m/yr (S) in 2000-2018. Overall, the glaciers trend to a stable state (similar to 0.05 m/yr) in both the south slope of the western Kunlun Mountains and Aru Co regions between 2000 and 2018. Similar patterns are also found for basin-wide examinations of lake storage changes (mass gains) and glacier mass budgets (positive or close to stable). The seasonal snow cover area changes, derived from cloud-free MODIS snow cover products, present a variable and insignificant trend between 2003 and 2017. Snow depth derived from passive microwave remote-sensing data, exhibits a decreasing trend between 1979 and 2015, but the water equivalent could contribute only an insignificant amount to the observed lake changes. The lake water gains, and almost positive glacier mass balance imply that the hydrological cycle in the northwestern Tibetan Plateau has become enhanced.

J	Matthews, L; Scott, D; Andrey, J				Matthews, Lindsay; Scott, Daniel; Andrey, Jean			Development of a data-driven weather index for beach parks tourism	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY												The complexity of the human-environment interface predicates the need for tools and techniques that can enable the effective translation of weather and climate products into decision-relevant information. Indices are a category of such tools that may be used to simplify multi-faceted climate information for economic and other decision-making. Climate indices for tourism have been popularized in the literature over the past three decades, but despite their prevalence, these indices have a number of limitations, including coarse temporal resolution, subjective rating and weighting schemes, and lack of empirical validation. This paper critically assesses the design of the tourism climate index, the holiday climate index-beach, and a new, mathematically optimized index developed for the unique contextual realities of Great Lakes beach tourism. This new methodology combines the use of expert knowledge, stated visitor preferences, and mathematical optimization to develop an index that assigns daily weather scores based on four weather sub-indices (thermal comfort, wind speed, precipitation, and cloud cover). These daily scores are then averaged to the monthly level and correlated to visitation data at two beach parks in Ontario (Canada). This optimized index demonstrates a strong fit (R-2 = 0.734, 0.657) with observed visitation at Pinery Provincial Park and Sandbanks Provincial Park, outperforming both the tourism climate index (R-2 = 0.474, 0.018) and the holiday climate index-beach (R-2 = 0.668, 0.427). This study advances our understanding of the magnitude and seasonality of weather impact on beach tourist visitation and can inform decision-making of tourism marketers and destination managers.

On this basis, the phytoplankton biological integrity index (PIBI) was established during dry and wet periods, and the health of the lake water ecosystem was evaluated. The results showed that the P-IBI in dry and wet periods was consistent throughout Lake Gehu, and the overall water ecological health assessment results were "moderate". To test the stability of the P-IBI, the relationships between the P-IBI, its constituent parameters and a single water quality environmental factor were analyzed through redundancy analysis (RDA). The results showed that total nitrogen, the hypermanganate index, chlorophyll a, dissolved oxygen, ammonia nitrogen, and transparency were highly correlated with the P-IBI system. Comparing the composition of the P-IBI during dry and wet periods and the relationships between the P-IBI system and water quality factors in the two hydrological periods, it was found that the parameters of the P-IBI system differed greatly between the dry and wet periods. The number of significantly related water quality factors in the dry period was greater than that in the wet period, and the two-axis characteristic values, the correlations between the P-IBI system and the water quality factors, and the cumulative percentage of the dry period were higher than those in the wet period. In conclusion, the P-IBI exhibits temporal variation between hydrological periods, and the stability of the P-IBI evaluation system during the dry season is significantly better than that during the wet season.

J	Voigt, C; Herwartz, D; Dorador, C; Staubwasser, M				Voigt, Claudia; Herwartz, Daniel; Dorador, Cristina; Staubwasser, Michael			Triple oxygen isotope systematics of evaporation and mixing processes in a dynamic desert lake system	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												This study investigates the combined hydrogen deuterium and triple oxygen isotope hydrology of the Salar del Huasco, an endorheic salt flat with shallow lakes at its centre that is located on the Altiplano Plateau, N Chile. This lacustrine system is hydrologically dynamic and complex because it receives inflow from multiple surface and groundwater sources. It undergoes seasonal flooding, followed by rapid shrinking of the water body at the prevailing arid climate with very high evaporation rates. At any given point in time, ponds, lakes, and recharge sources capture a large range of evaporation degrees. Samples taken between 2017 and 2019 show a range of delta O-18 between 13.3 parts per thousand and 14.5 parts per thousand, dexcess between 7 parts per thousand and 100 parts per thousand, and O-17-excess between 19 and -108 per meg. A pan evaporation experiment conducted on-site was used to derive the turbulence coefficient of the Craig-Gordon isotope evaporation model for the local wind regime. This, along with sampling of atmospheric vapour at the salar ( -21.0 +/- 3.3 parts per thousand for delta O-18, 34 +/- 6 parts per thousand for d-excess and 23 +/- 9 per meg for O-17-excess), enabled the accurate reproduction of measured ponds and lake isotope data by the Craig-Gordon model. In contrast to classic delta H-2- delta O-18 studies, the O-17-excess data not only allow one to distinguish two different types of evaporation - evaporation with and without recharge - but also to identify mixing processes between evaporated lake water and fresh flood water. Multiple generations of infiltration events can also be inferred from the triple oxygen isotope composition of inflow water, indicating mixing of sources with different evaporation histories. These processes cannot be resolved using classic delta H-2- delta O-18 data alone. Adding triple oxygen isotope measurements to isotope hydrology studies may therefore significantly im- prove the accuracy of a lake's hydrological balance - i.e. the evaporation-to-inflow ratio (E / I) - estimated by water isotope data and application of the Craig-Gordon isotope evaporation model.

Direct measurements of ice-shelf flexure caused by surface meltwater ponding and drainage	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Global sea-level rise is caused, in part, by more rapid ice discharge from Antarctica, following the removal of the restraining forces of floating ice-shelves after their break-up. A trigger of ice-shelf break-up is thought to be stress variations associated with surface meltwater ponding and drainage, causing flexure and fracture. But until now, there have been no direct measurements of these processes. Here, we present field data from the McMurdo Ice Shelf, Antarctica, showing that the filling, to similar to 2 m depth, and subsequent draining, by overflow and channel incision, of four surface lakes causes pronounced and immediate ice-shelf flexure over multiple-week timescales. The magnitude of the vertical ice-shelf deflection reaches maxima of similar to 1 m at the lake centres, declining to zero at distances of <500 m. Our results should be used to guide development of continent-wide ice-sheet models, which currently do not simulate ice-shelf break-up due to meltwater loading and unloading.

J	Paerl, HW; Huisman, J				Paerl, Hans W.; Huisman, Jef			Climate change: a catalyst for global expansion of harmful cyanobacterial blooms	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS												Cyanobacteria are the Earth's oldest known oxygen-evolving photosynthetic microorganisms, and they have had major impacts on shaping our current atmosphere and biosphere. Their long evolutionary history has enabled cyanobacteria to develop survival strategies and persist as important primary producers during numerous geochemical and climatic changes that have taken place on Earth during the past 3.5 billion years. Today, some cyanobacterial species form massive surface growths or 'blooms' that produce toxins, cause oxygen depletion and alter food webs, posing a major threat to drinking and irrigation water supplies, fishing and recreational use of surface waters worldwide. These harmful cyanobacteria can take advantage of anthropogenically induced nutrient over-enrichment (eutrophication), and hydrologic modifications (water withdrawal, reservoir construction). Here, we review recent studies revealing that regional and global climatic change may benefit various species of harmful cyanobacteria by increasing their growth rates, dominance, persistence, geographic distributions and activity. Future climatic change scenarios predict rising temperatures, enhanced vertical stratification of aquatic ecosystems, and alterations in seasonal and interannual weather patterns (including droughts, storms, floods); these changes all favour harmful cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic waters. Therefore, current mitigation and water management strategies, which are largely based on nutrient input and hydrologic controls, must also accommodate the environmental effects of global warming.

Among many rapidly changing lakes is the Tonle Sap Lake (TSL) in Cambodia-Southeast Asia's largest inland lake-which is under growing threats from altered flows and inundation dynamics due to compounding effects of climate change and dam construction in the Mekong River basin (MRB). While previous studies have examined the potential causes of recent changes in open water areas, a mechanistic quantification of the lake's shifting hydrologic balance and inundation dynamics due to natural climate variability and dam operations is lacking. Here, using a hydrological-hydrodynamic modeling system that includes the major dams in the MRB, we show that while climate variability has been a key driver of inter-decadal variabilities in the lake's water balance, the operation of Mekong dams has exerted a growing influence-especially after 2010-on the Mekong flood pulse, Tonle Sap River's flow reversal, and the TSL's inundation dynamics. The dam-induced dampening of the Mekong's peak discharge increased from 1-2% during 1979-2009 to -7% in the 2010s, causing comparable alterations in the peak of inflow from the Mekong into TSL. More crucially, during the 2010s, the dams caused a reduction in annual inflow volume into TSL by 10-25% and shortened the annual inundation duration by up to 15 days in the lake's periphery. Further, seasonally inundated areas decreased (increased) most substantially by -245 km2 or -3% (-270 km2 or -6%) in August (April) during the 2010s. These results demonstrate that Mekong dams have already caused substantial alterations in the hydrologic balance and inundation dynamics of the TSL. Our findings offer critical insights relevant for improved transboundary water management and decision making in light of growing concerns about the adverse impacts of large dams in the MRB.

Supraglacial lake drainage at a fast-flowing Greenlandic outlet glacier	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Supraglacial lake drainage events influence Greenland Ice Sheet dynamics on hourly to interannual timescales. However, direct observations are rare, and, to date, no in situ studies exist from fast-flowing sectors of the ice sheet. Here, we present observations of a rapid lake drainage event at Store Glacier, west Greenland, in 2018. The drainage event transported 4.8 x 10(6) m(3) of meltwater to the glacier bed in similar to 5 h, reducing the lake to a third of its original volume. During drainage, the local ice surface rose by 0.55 m, and surface velocity increased from 2.0 m.d(-1) to 5.3 m.d(-1). Dynamic responses were greatest similar to 4 km downstream from the lake, which we interpret as an area of transient water storage constrained by basal topography. Drainage initiated, without any precursory trigger, when the lake expanded and reactivated a preexisting fracture that had been responsible for a drainage event 1 y earlier. Since formation, this fracture had advected similar to 500 m from the lakes deepest point, meaning the lake did not fully drain. Partial drainage events have previously been assumed to occur slowly via lake overtopping, with a comparatively small dynamic influence. In contrast, our findings show that partial drainage events can be caused by hydrofracture, producing new hydrological connections that continue to concentrate the supply of surface meltwater to the bed of the ice sheet throughout the melt season. Our findings therefore indicate that the quantity and resultant dynamic influence of rapid lake drainages are likely being underestimated.

In recent decades, the water level of the middle of dry season had a tendency of significant increase in Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake (DL and PL, the two largest freshwater lake of China). Landscape pattern is sensitive to the local environmental changes and anthropogenic activity, and could influence the progresses and function of ecosystems. In this study, the landscape pattern between middle of dry season with increased water level (DIW) and that with normal water level (DNW) were compared to reveal the influence of the increasing of water level during the middle of dry season on landscape pattern of DL and PL. The results revealed that the increasing of water level during the middle of dry season caused expanding of deep water (cover increased from 14.40% to 18.36% of the total lake) to shallow water zone and expanding of shallow water (from 6.41% to 10.12%) to mudflat zone in DL; while it caused expanding of deep water (from 24.17% to 46.00%) to shallow water, sand, mudflat and grass zone and expanding of shallow water (from 12.18% to 19.51%) to sand, mudflat and grass zone in PL. In landscape metrics, it caused significant increase of the LPI in PL. In class metrics, it caused the some significant changes of landscape pattern indices (such as TA, LPI, MPS, AMPFDI, MNN and IJI) of the lakes. It had greater effects on the landscape pattern of PL than that of DL. And these changes of landscape pattern would affect birds, fish and mammals.					; Sun, Shiquan/AAA-2541-2019; Wu, Haipeng/O-2852-2015; Chen, Hong/S-4453-2019	Yu, Guanlong/0000-0002-6604-8360; Chen, Hong/0000-0001-8937-3804; Wu, Haipeng/0000-0002-9888-6959; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				JUN	2020	113								106283	10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106283	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106283													WOS:000523335900035

Thus, in this study, we present the spatio-temporal dynamics of land use change and climate aiming to provide a scientific evidence about gains and losses in major land use categories and associated drivers and significancy and homogeneity of climate change. To this end, Landsat images and historical climate data have been used to determine the dynamics. In addition, population census data and land use policy have been considered to assess the potential drivers of land use change. The spatio-temporal land use dynamics have been evaluated using transition matrix and dynamics index. Likewise, shifts in the climate data were analyzed using change point analysis and three homogenous climate zones have been identified using principal component analysis. The results show that, from 1989 to 2019, the areal percentage of agricultural land increased by 27.5%, settlement by 0.8%, and barren land 0.4% while the natural vegetation, wetland, water body, and grass land decreased by 24.5%, 1.6%, 0.5%, and 2.1%, respectively. The land use dynamics have been stronger in the first decade of the study period. An abrupt shift of climate has occurred in the 1980s. In the last four decades, rainfall shows a not significant decreasing trend. However, a significant increasing trend has been observed for temperature. Rapid population growth, agricultural expansion policy, and climate variability have been identified as the underlying drivers of land use dynamics.

Bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of metals, As and Se through a freshwater food web affected by antrophic pollution in Cordoba, Argentina	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												The concentration of metals (Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ag, Cd, Hg, Pb, U), As and Se in different ecosystem components (water, sediment, plankton, shrimp, and fish muscle) has been determined in a eutrophic reservoir in the Province of Cordoba (Argentina). Los Molinos Lake (LML) was sampled during the dry (DS) and wet seasons (WS) in order to examine the bioaccumulation and transfer of these inorganic elements through the food web. Stable nitrogen isotope (delta N-15) was used to investigate trophic interactions. According to this, samples were divided into three categories: plankton, shrimp (Palaemonetes argentinus) and fish (Silverside, Odontesthes bonariensis). The bioaccumulation factor (BAF) was calculated for the organisms, and it was determined that the elements analyzed undergo bioaccumulation, especially in organisms such as plankton. The invertebrates were characterized by the highest BAF for Cu and Zn in both seasons, As (DS), and Cd and Hg (WS). The fish muscle was characterized by the highest BAF for Se (WS), Ag and Hg (DS). On the other hand, a significant decrease in Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Cd and U concentrations through the analyzed trophic web during both seasons was observed. Moreover, a significant increase in Hg levels was observed with increasing trophic levels in the DS, indicating its biomagnification. Despite the increasing impact of metals, As and Se pollution in the studied area due to urban growth and agricultural and livestock activities, no previous study has focused on the behavior and relationships of these pollutants with the biotic and abiotic components of this aquatic reservoir. We expect that these findings may be used for providing directions or guidance for future monitoring and environmental protection policies.					; Wunderlin, Daniel/A-2195-2014; Horacek, Micha/AAC-2700-2020	Griboff, Julieta/0009-0006-8648-799X; Horacek, Micha/0000-0002-2471-1232													0147-6513	1090-2414				FEB	2018	148						275	284		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.10.028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.10.028								29078130					WOS:000429892700031

CryoSat-2 swath interferometric altimetry for mapping ice elevation and elevation change	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH												For more than 25 years, satellite radar altimetry has provided continuous information on the state of the cryosphere and on its contribution to global sea-level rise. The technique typically delivers maps of ice-sheet elevation and elevation change with 3-10 km spatial resolution and seasonal to monthly temporal resolution. Here we show how the interferometric mode of CryoSat-2 can be used to map broad (5 km-wide) swaths of surface elevation with fine (500 m) spatial resolution from each satellite pass, providing a step-change in the capability of satellite altimetry for glaciology. These swaths of elevation data contain up to two orders of magnitude more surface elevation measurements than standard altimeter products, which provide single elevation measurements based on the range to the Point-Of Closest-Approach (POCA) in the vicinity of the sub-satellite ground track. The swath elevations allow a more dense, statistically robust time series of elevation change to be formed with temporal resolution of a factor 5 higher than for POCA. The mean differences between airborne altimeter and CryoSat-2 derived ice sheet elevations and elevation rates range from --0.93 +/- 1.17 m and 0.29 +/- 1.25 m a(-1), respectively, at the POCA, to -1.50 +/- 1.73 m and 0.04 +/- 1.04 m a(-1), respectively, across the entire swath. We demonstrate the potential of these data by creating and evaluating elevation models of: (i) the Austfonna Ice Cap (Svalbard), (ii) western Greenland, and (iii) Law Dome (East Antarctica); and maps of ice elevation change of: (iv) the Amundsen Sea sector (West Antarctica), (v) Icelandic ice caps, and (vi) above an active subglacial lake system at Thwaites Glacier (Antarctica), each at 500 m spatial posting - around 10 times finer than possible using traditional approaches based on standard altimetry products.

In this study, the seasonal and spatial variations of several classes of cyanotoxins (microcystins, cylindrospermopsins, saxitoxins) and taste-and-odor (T&O) compounds (beta-cyclocitral, beta-ionone, geosmin, 2-methylisoborneol) in Lake Taihu were simultaneously investigated for the first time. The total cyanotoxins were dominated by microcystins with concentrations highest in November (mean 2209 ng/L) and lowest in February (mean 48.7 ng/L). Cylindrospermopsins were abundant in May with the highest content of 622.8 ng/L. Saxitoxins only occurred in May (mean 19.2 ng/L) and November (mean 198.5 ng/L). Extracellular T&O compounds were most concentrated in August, the highest being extracellular beta-cyclocitral (mean 240.6 ng/L) followed by 2-methylisoborneol (mean 146.6 ng/L). Environment variables play conflicting roles in modulating the dynamics of different groups of cyanotoxins and T&O compounds. Total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), chlorophyll-a and cyanobacteria density were important factors affecting the variation of total microcystins, beta-cyclocitral and beta-ionone concentrations. In contrast, total cylindrospermopsins, 2-methylisoborneol and geosmin concentrations were significantly influenced by water temperature and TP. There was a significant and linear relationship between microcystins and beta-cyclocitral/ beta-ionone, while cylindrospermopsins were positively correlated with 2-methylisoborneol and geosmin. The perceptible odors may be good indicators for the existence of cyanotoxins. Hazard quotients revealed that potential human health risks from microcystins were high in August and November. Meanwhile, the risks from cylindrospermopsins were at moderate levels. Cylindrospermopsins and saxitoxins were first identified in this lake, suggesting that diverse cyanotoxins might co-occur more commonly than previously thought. Hence, the risks from other cyanotoxins beyond microcystins shouldn't be ignored. This study also highlights that the necessity for further assessing the combination effects of these complex metabolites.

Aerobic methanotrophs can consume a notable proportion of the methane produced in lacustrine ecosystems. However, previous studies mainly focused on aerobic methanotrophs in deep and oligotrophic lakes, while little is known about these organisms in shallow and eutrophic lakes. Lake eutrophication leads to more abundant substrates for methanogenesis, and a subsequent higher methane flux. Therefore, the methanotrophs in eutrophic lakes might play a more important role in mediating lacustrine methane emission. In the current study, aerobic methanotrophs in the sediments of two adjacent shallow freshwater lakes at different trophic status (mesotrophic and eutrophic, respectively) were investigated. Abundant methanotrophs and active aerobic methane oxidation were observed in both lakes. While the eutrophic lake harbored a higher abundance of methanotrophs. The result of pmoA-based high-throughput sequencing suggested that methanotrophic communities in the two studied lakes were dominated by unique groups (Type Ib and Type II), dependent on lake and season. But generally, eutrophication might lead to a higher proportion of Type II methanotrophs. The abundance and uniqueness of methanotrophic community could be attributed to lake eutrophication, and were regulated by environmental variables of both sediment and overlying water. This work provides a new insight towards methanotrophs in shallow freshwater lake impacted by eutrophication. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, hydrochemical and stable (delta D and delta O-18) and radium (Ra-223, Ra-224, Ra-226, and Ra-228) isotopic approaches were employed to study the hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics of groundwater and surface water (river water and lake water) to identify the places where groundwater discharged into Poyang Lake and the groundwater discharge sources. The results showed that the groundwater discharge area was extensive during the dry season. The locations of predominant groundwater discharge were indicated by the evolution of radium and stable isotopes in lake water along two water flow profiles. At the confluence of Ganjiang and Xiushui rivers, groundwater with more negative delta O-18 value than that of the lake water discharged into this area, and the estimated groundwater discharge proportion in this area was close to that of the river water input. The main sources of groundwater input for Poyang Lake were inferred to originate from clastic rock pore-fissure aquifer and bedrock fissured aquifer around this lake. This study also found that groundwater affected by the anthropogenic activities may have discharged into Poyang Lake. Future studies are required to focus on groundwater discharge into Poyang Lake for its management and protection. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A post-Cassini view of Titan's methane-based hydrologic cycle	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												The methane-based hydrologic cycle on Saturn's largest moon, Titan, is an extreme analogue to Earth's water cycle. Titan is the only planetary body in the Solar System, other than Earth, that is known to have an active hydrologic cycle. With a surface pressure of 1.5 bar and temperatures of 90 to 95 K, methane and ethane condense out of a nitrogen-based atmosphere and flow as liquids on the moon's surface. Exchange processes between atmospheric, surface and subsurface reservoirs produce methane and ethane cloud systems, as well as erosional and depositional landscapes that have strikingly similar forms to their terrestrial counterparts. Over its 13-year exploration of the Saturn system, the Cassini-Huygens mission revealed that Titan's hydrocarbon-based hydrology is driven by nested methane cycles that operate over a range of timescales, including geologic, orbital (for example, Croll-Milankovitch cycles), seasonal and that of a single convective storm. In this Review Article, we describe the dominant exchange processes that operate over these timescales and present a post-Cassini view of Titan's methane-based hydrologic system.

The recent global warming has caused dramatic glacial lake changes and increased potential GLOF risk, particularly in Tibet Plateau (TP). Thus there is a pressing need to understand area and spatial distribution of glacial lakes at a large scale. Current efforts about glacial lake mapping in TP region is limited by spurious detections in the heterogeneous backgrounds. The nonlocal active contour algorithm, which takes full consideration of the regional heterogeneity in image, has been effectively applied in the field of medical image segmentation, but has not been tested at large scale of glaciated area yet. Moreover, the improved radiometric resolution and geographic coverage from Landsat 8 provides an opportunity to map glacial lakes. This study evaluated the potential of Landsat 8 images on annual glacial lake mapping in TP region which was characterized by various complex water conditions. The Google Earth Engine based cloud computing effectively facilitated the processing of a complete time series of Landsat 8 imagery from 2015 (156 path/rows and approximately 3580 scenes). Characteristics of glacial lake distribution were analyzed from aspects of size classes and elevation. Our results demonstrate that these strategies and methods automatically produce highly reliable glacial lake extents across the entire TP region, and are potentially applicable to other large-scale glacial lake mapping projects.

Urbanization promotes specific bacteria in freshwater microbiomes including potential pathogens	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Freshwater ecosystems are characterized by complex and highly dynamic microbial communities that are strongly structured by their local environment and biota. Accelerating urbanization and growing city populations detrimentally alter freshwater environments. To determine differences in freshwater microbial communities associated with urban-ization, full-length 16S rRNA gene PacBio sequencing was performed in a case study from surface waters and sedi-ments from a wastewater treatment plant, urban and rural lakes in the Berlin-Brandenburg region, Northeast Germany. Water samples exhibited highly habitat specific bacterial communities with multiple genera showing clear urban signatures. We identified potentially harmful bacterial groups associated with environmental parameters specific to urban habitats such as Alistipes, Escherichia/Shigella, Rickettsia and Streptococcus. We demonstrate that urban-ization alters natural microbial communities in lakes and, via simultaneous warming and eutrophication and creates favourable conditions that promote specific bacterial genera including potential pathogens. Our findings are evidence to suggest an increased potential for long-term health risk in urbanized waterbodies, at a time of rapidly expanding global urbanization. The results highlight the urgency for undertaking mitigation measures such as targeted lake restoration projects and sustainable water management efforts.					; Ganzert, Lars/AAT-1992-2021; Greenwood, Alex/GWU-8292-2022; Grossart, Hans-Peter/E-6705-2017; Domisch, Sami/E-5745-2011	Domisch, Sami/0000-0002-8127-9335; Woodhouse, Jason/0000-0003-1129-5396; Ganzert, Lars/0000-0001-9595-1041													0048-9697	1879-1026				NOV 1	2022	845								157321	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157321	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157321		JUL 2022						35839872					WOS:000831321900001

Sinter-vein correlations at Buckskin Mountain, National District, Humboldt County, Nevada	ECONOMIC GEOLOGY												At Buckskin Mountain (elev 2,650 m, 8,743 ft), Humboldt County, Nevada, a hydrothermal system, imposed on a middle Miocene volcanic sequence with contrasting permeabilities and tensile strengths, produced alteration assemblages controlled by elevation, from Hg-mineralized sinter to subjacent precious metal veins over a vertical distance exceeding 790 in. Sinter and epiclastic deposits, interpreted to be renmant paleosurface basinal strata enclosed by 16.6 to 16.1 Ma rhyolites, overlie older volcaniclastic basinal deposits and were part of a regional fluvial-lacustrine system developed among ca. 16 to 12 Ma basalt-rhyolite eruptive centers throughout the northern Great Basin. Because of contrasting erosional resistance among altered and unaltered rocks, Buckskin Mountain represents inverse topography with sinter and silicified epiclastic deposits at the summit. Sinter and veins, correlated by common elements, similar mineralogy, age constraints, textures, S isotope compositions, and fluid inclusion microthermometry, were deposited by sinter-vein fluid, the first of two sequential hydrothermal fluid regimes that evolved in response to magmatism, tectonism, hydrology, and topography. Thermal quenching of distally derived sinter-vein fluid in planar conduits caused deposition of handed quartz-silicate-selenide-sulfide veins similar to 270 to > 440 m below sinter at 16.1 Ma; veins were initially enveloped by zoned selvages of proximal K-feldspar + K-mica + quartz + pyrite and distal illite + chlorite + calcite + pyrite. Mixing of sinter-vein fluid with local meteoric water in saturated basinal deposits caused deposition of silica, Hg-Se-S-Cl minerals, and precious metals in sinter and epiclastic deposits. Elevated Sigma(Se)/Sigma(S) in sinter-vein fluid, and the relatively large stability fields of reduced aqueous selenide species in the temperature range of 250 degrees to < 100 degrees C, enabled (but was not the cause of) codeposition of selenide-sulfide minerals and common element associations in veins and sinter. Acid-sulfate fluid of the second fluid regime was derived from oxidation of H2S and other volatiles exsolvedfrom sinter-vein fluid. Acid-sulfate fluid produced (1) a subhorizontal zone of partially leached basinal deposits and rhyolite from the paleosurface to a depth of similar to 60 m, and (2) laterally pervasive zones, similar to 100 to 200 m thick, of quartz + alunite +/- hematite and quartz + kaolinite + pyrite in volcaniclastic deposits immediately beneath partially leached rocks, but this fluid did not decompose selenide-sulfide-precious metal phases in sinter. Paragenetically late vein and wall-rock assemblages, including marcasite + pyrite, calcite, and kaolinite-replaced K minerals, record deeper transition of sinter-vein fluid into acid-sulfate fluid in vein conduits. This transition occurred as regional subsidence, manifested by the Goosey Lake depression immediately east of Buckskin Mountain, lowered the pieziometric surface at Buckskin Mountain, terminated sinter deposition, and caused boiling and/or degassing of sinter-vein fluid. The timing of subsidence is recorded by a decrease in alunite ages, from ca. 15.8 to 15.6 Ma, with depth below sinter. Lateral replacement of sinter and partially leached epiclastic deposits and rhyolite by opal-A marks the termination of the two hydrothermal regimes that lasted similar to 0.5 m.y. and followed rhyolitic volcanism of similar duration. Veins and sinter display textures that attest to plastic deformation, spalling, and gravitational settling, and indicate fluid-flow direction, velocity and density stratification which, with conduit topology, may have influenced precious metal tenor in the veins. Components of sinter and veins were transported as colloids, formed in supersaturated sinter-vein fluid, that aggregated or coagulated as incompetent gelatinous layers in shallow pools and in underlying, near-vertical conduits in rhyolite and initially crystallized as opal and chalcedony. The low thermal conductivity of homogeneous, structurally isotropic, and relatively impermeable rhyolite, and limited hydraulic permeability of altered overlying volcaniclastic deposits, insulated conduits and maintained increinents of sinter-vein fluid in a nearly isothermal environment (250 degrees +/- 20 degrees C) over vertical distances of hundreds of meters. The rhythmic layering of sinter beds and vein bands reflects (1) flow impedance by silicification of volcaniclastic deposits at the tops of conduits and by coagulation of semisolid silica gel in vents and subsinter channels, and (2) flow restoration by over-pressured fluid that ruptured silica gel, clearing conduit blockages and creating new fluid pathways. These pressure cycles enabled sinter-vein fluid to rapidly fill conduits, supersaturate, nucleate colloids, and be flushed upward from conduits into shallow paleosurface depressions, leading to simultaneous deposition of paired vein bands and sinter beds in overlying pools. These cycles also minimized fluid boiling and degassing during sinter-vein deposition. Miocene hydrodynamics at Buckskin Mountain imply stable topographic recharge systems of several hundred thousand years duration throughout the northern Great Basin from ca. 16 to 12 Ma when basalt-rhyolite volcanism and numerous Se-rich, precious metal hydrothermal systems were active. Hydrothermal fluids that contain elevated Sigma(Se)/Sigma(S) may deposit Hg selenide-sulfide minerals and precious metals that can be detected by close examination of near-surface alteration assemblages and sinter, providing guides to subjacent precious metal veins. Topographic effects on hydrologic discharge and recharge, hydraulic conductivity and structural contrasts within the stratigraphic section, and temperature gradient and amplitude imposed by magina, were the main controls of the morphology of the Buckskin Mountain system and ultimately determined the existence of sinter and veins and degree of metal concentration in other middle Miocene hydrothermal systems.																			0361-0128	1554-0774				MAR-APR	2007	102	2					193	224		10.2113/gsecongeo.102.2.193	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gsecongeo.102.2.193													WOS:000247648800002

Dual-satellite (Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8) remote sensing of supraglacial lakes in Greenland	CRYOSPHERE												Remote sensing is commonly used to monitor supraglacial lakes on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS); however, most satellite records must trade off higher spatial resolution for higher temporal resolution (e.g. MODIS) or vice versa (e.g. Landsat). Here, we overcome this issue by developing and applying a dual-sensor method that can monitor changes to lake areas and volumes at high spatial resolution (10-30 m) with a frequent revisit time (similar to 3 days). We achieve this by mosaicking imagery from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) with imagery from the recently launched Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) for a similar to 12 000 km(2) area of West Greenland in the 2016 melt season. First, we validate a physically based method for calculating lake depths with Sentinel-2 by comparing measurements against those derived from the available contemporaneous Landsat 8 imagery; we find close correspondence between the two sets of values (R-2 = 0.841; RMSE = 0.555 m). This provides us with the methodological basis for automatically calculating lake areas, depths, and volumes from all available Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images. These automatic methods are incorporated into an algorithm for Fully Automated Supraglacial lake Tracking at Enhanced Resolution (FASTER). The FASTER algorithm produces time series showing lake evolution during the 2016 melt season, including automated rapid (<= 4 day) lake-drainage identification. With the dual Sentinel-2-Landsat 8 record, we identify 184 rapidly draining lakes, many more than identified with either imagery collection alone (93 with Sentinel-2; 66 with Landsat 8), due to their inferior temporal resolution, or would be possible with MODIS, due to its omission of small lakes < 0.125 km(2). Finally, we estimate the water volumes drained into the GrIS during rapid-lake-drainage events and, by analysing downscaled regional climate-model (RACMO2.3p(2)) run-off data, the water quantity that enters the GrIS via the moulins opened by such events. We find that during the lake-drainage events alone, the water drained by small lakes (< 0.125 km(2)) is only 5.1% of the total water volume drained by all lakes. However, considering the total water volume entering the GrIS after lake drainage, the moulins opened by small lakes deliver 61.5% of the total water volume delivered via the moulins opened by large and small lakes; this is because there are more small lakes, allowing more moulins to open, and because small lakes are found at lower elevations than large lakes, where run-off is higher. These findings suggest that small lakes should be included in future remote-sensing and modelling work.

In this study, a series of remotely sensed images with a resolution of 30 m (HJ-CCD and Landsat TM) were collected and used to map the distribution of aquatic vegetation types in Taihu Lake, China. Seasonal and interannual dynamics of aquatic vegetation types were explored and analyzed. The distribution areas of Type I (emergent, floating-leaved and floating vegetation) and Type II (submerged vegetation) were used to model their growing season phenology by double logistic functions. The resulting double logistic models showed, the area of Type I reached its peak in mid-August, and the maximum area for Type II occurred in mid-September. From 1984 to 2013, Type I area increased continuously from 59.75 km(2) to 148.00 km(2) (R-2 = 0.84), whereas the area covered by Type II first increased and then decreased, with a trend conforming to a significant quadratic curve (R-2 = 0.83). The eutrophication and stable state of Taihu Lake was assessed using a simple indicator which was expressed as a ratio of Type II area to Type I area. The results showed that the eutrophication in the lake might have been increasing in the area studied since 2000. Additionally, the results showed that air temperature had likely a direct effect on the growth of Type I (R-2 = 0.66) and a significant, but delayed, effect on the growth of Type II.

Three decades of landslide activity in western Nepal: new insights into trends and climate drivers	LANDSLIDES												In recent decades, landslide disasters in the Himalayas, as in other mountain regions, are widely reported to have increased. While some studies have suggested a link to increasing heavy rainfall under a warmer climate, others pointed to anthropogenic influences on slope stability, and increasing exposure of people and assets located in harm's way. A lack of sufficiently high-resolution regional landslide inventories, both spatially and temporally, has prevented any robust consensus so far. Focusing on Far-Western Nepal, we draw on remote sensing techniques to create a regional inventory of 26,350 single landslide events, of which 8778 date to the period 1992-2018. These events serve as a basis for the analyses of landslide frequency relationships and trends in relation to precipitation and temperature datasets. Results show a strong correlation between the annual number of shallow landslides and the accumulated monsoon precipitation (r = 0.74). Furthermore, warm and dry monsoons followed by especially rainy monsoons produce the highest incidence of shallow landslides (r = 0.77). However, we find strong spatial variability in the strength of these relationships, which is linked to recent demographic development in the region. This highlights the role of anthropogenic drivers, and in particular road cutting and land-use change, in amplifying the seasonal monsoon influence on slope stability. In parallel, the absence of any long-term trends in landslide activity, despite widely reported increase in landslide disasters, points strongly to increasing exposure of people and infrastructure as the main driver of landslide disasters in this region of Nepal. By contrast, no climate change signal is evident from the data.

Karst rivers typically exhibit unique biogeochemical characteristics and different human inputs; whether and how these special differences affect DOM distribution, transport and composition are not clear. Here, 134 samples were obtained from the Daning River, a typical karst river located in the mountain landscapes of the Yangtze River, during both the dry and wet seasons. Multiple methods including UV-visible absorption, three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation analysis were used to research the molecular compositions, optical properties and origins of DOM. During the wet season, there was higher aromaticity and intensity of UV absorbing functional groups in DOM. The higher Fmax of the protein-like component in the wet season suggested more biological sources in DOM. PCA indicated that autochthonous sources and biodegradation were the main sources of DOM during the two seasons. During the dry season, forest showed the opposite effect on DOM quality when compared to farmland and urban. The findings demonstrated that monsoonal climate and biogeochemical processes were the primary reasons for the differences in DOM components and sources, which benefits the understanding of carbon biogeochemical processes in the karst rivers. More importantly, the analysis of DOM composition and sources can provide valuable insights into identifying potential contaminants and understanding water quality variations, which is beneficial to the concrete implementation of water protection.					; Li, Siyue/E-8297-2012; Shijie, Gu/JTU-7947-2023	Gu, Shijie/0000-0002-2309-261X; Li, Siyue/0000-0002-3097-6819; maofei, ni/0000-0002-4905-2739													0022-1694	1879-2707				AUG	2023	623								129825	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129825	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129825		JUN 2023											WOS:001023086500001

Climate impact on fluvial-lake system evolution, Eocene Green River Formation, Uinta Basin, Utah, USA	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												In light of a modern understanding of early Eocene greenhouse climate fluctuations and new highly seasonal fluvial system faces models, the role of climate in the evolution of one classically-cited continental, terminal lake system is re-examined. Detailed stratigraphic description and elemental abundance data from fifteen cores and seven outcrop regions of the Green River Formation were used to construct a similar to 150 km cross section across the Uinta Basin, Utah, USA. Lake Uinta in the Uinta Basin is divided into five lake phases: (1) post-Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum, (2) peak Eocene hyperthermal, (3) waning hyperthermal, Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO), (4) post-hyperthermal, and (5) post-EECO regimes, based primarily on climatically driven changes in fluvial style in combination with sedimentary indicators of lacustrine carbonate deposition, organic matter preservation, salinity, and lake depth. Basinwide siliciclastic dominated intervals were deposited by highly seasonal fluvial systems and record negative organic carbon isotope excursions associated with early Eocene abrupt, transient global warming (hyperthermal) events. Carbonate dominated or organic rich intervals record stable, less seasonal climate periods between hyperthermals, with lower siliciclastic sediment supply allowing the development of carbonate and organic matter preservation. The stratigraphic progression from alternating organic rich and lean zones to the overlying organic rich Mahogany and R8 zones represents the global transition out of the pulsed early Eocene hyperthermal climate regime to a time of sediment starvation and lake stratification, sequestering sedimentary organic carbon. This study provides a novel approach to terrestrial paleoclimate reconstruction that relies largely on unique sedimentary indicators and secondarily on isotopic proxy records within the context of a large basin-wide sedimentologic and stratigraphic data set, thus setting the stage for future detailed geochemical terrestrial paleoclimate proxy development.					; Plink-Bjorklund, Piret/AAF-2936-2019	Plink-Bjorklund, Piret/0000-0003-1637-2100; Birgenheier, Lauren/0000-0001-6951-0939													0016-7606	1943-2674				MAR-APR	2020	132	3-4					562	587		10.1130/B31808.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B31808.1													WOS:000518916800006

This study therefore investigates the distribution of silver and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the aquatic environment of Skudai River, Johor, Malaysia. Water, sediment, plant, and fish samples were collected seasonally along four sites along Skudai River between May 2018 and April 2019. All samples were subjected to Ag analysis using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). The analysis demonstrated that the concentration of Ag detected in water samples ranging from 0.001 to 0.505 mg/L was the lowest, whereas in the plants, 0.235 to 4.713 mg/kg of Ag was quantified. The upper sediments contained 0.036 to 28.115 mg/kg of Ag, whilst fish samples presented the highest accumulation of Ag, averaging between 9.144 and 53.784 mg/kg of Ag. Subsequently, the formation of silver nanoparticles was further proven by TEM-EDX analysis, where the detected size of AgNPs ranged from 20 nm to 35 nm. The overriding conclusion implied by bioaccumulation factor (BAF) and biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) calculations suggested that Skudai River was indeed polluted by Ag and AgNPs. The values obtained stipulated that silver accumulation is occurring at an alarming rate and could therefore endanger fish consumers.					-, Marpongahtun/GOH-3175-2022; Azman, Shamila/O-1818-2013; Salmiati, Salmiati/O-1958-2013; Yong, EL/N-7207-2013; , Salmiati/O-1958-2013; 10830, NOR ZAIHA BTE ARMAN/KFS-2975-2024; Salim, Mohd/AAM-3122-2020; Marpongahtun, Marpongahtun/GOH-3175-2022	-, Marpongahtun/0000-0003-1050-0431; Mat Lazim, Zainab/0000-0002-9289-574X; , Salmiati/0000-0002-8914-4048; 														2073-4441				APR	2023	15	7							1349	10.3390/w15071349	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15071349													WOS:000970306900001

The purpose of this study was to examine runoff and soil loss responses under cropland (CL) and grazing land (GL) management practices in three climatic regions of the Ethiopian highlands: semi-arid (Mayleba), dry sub -humid (Gumara), and humid (Guder). We measured runoff and soil loss using runoff plots with and without soil and water conservation (SWC) measures (trenches, stone/soil bunds [embankments] with trenches on the upslope side, and exclosure) during the rainy season (July-September). The results revealed significant variation in runoff and soil loss amounts across land uses, SWC measures, and climatic regions. At Mayleba, seasonal runoff and soil loss in control plot were far higher from GL (280 mm, 26.5 t ha-1) than from CL (108 mm, 7.0 t ha-1) largely due to lack of protective vegetation cover and soil disruption because of intense grazing. In contrast, at Gumara and Guder, seasonal soil loss values were much higher from CL (21.4-71.2 t ha -1) than from GL (0.6-24.2 t ha -1) irrespective of runoff values. This was attributed to the excessive tillage/weeding operations involved in cultivation of teff (cereal crop) at Gumara and potato at Guder. Although SWC measures (practices) substantially reduced runoff and soil loss (decreased by 23%-86%) relative to control plot, seasonal soil loss under GL uses with trenches at Mayleba (12.6 t ha-1), CL with soil bunds and trenches at Gumara (22.1 t ha-1), and Guder (21.4 t ha-1) remained higher than the average tolerable soil loss rate (10 t ha- 1 year-1) proposed for the Ethiopian highlands. This suggests that SWC measures should be carefully designed and evaluated specific to land use and climatic conditions. Overall, the results of this study can help improve SWC planning in regions where land use and climate impact on soil erosion vary across geographical areas, as they do in Ethiopia and anywhere else. However, further investigation is crucial with replication of measurements over years and lo-cations to provide more accurate information on land use, management and climate controls on hydrological and soil erosion processes.					; Haregeweyn, Nigussie/J-5616-2015; Sultan, Dagnenet/AAJ-9200-2020; Ebabu, Kindiye/AAH-7884-2019; Tsunekawa, Atsushi/L-8526-2013; Tsubo, Mitsuru/C-4027-2016; Van+Wesemael, Bas/Y-2444-2019; Fenta, Ayele A./P-1639-2016; Fenta, Ayele/P-1639-2016	Wondim, Gebeyehu Taye/0000-0003-3078-5016; Haregeweyn, Nigussie/0000-0003-2920-8094; POESEN, Jean/0000-0001-6218-8967; Ebabu, Kindiye/0000-0002-1381-149X; Tsunekawa, Atsushi/0000-0002-7690-0633; Sultan, Dagnenet/0000-0002-1449-924X; Fenta, Ayele A./0000-0002-8228-4048; Tsubo, Mitsuru/0000-0002-8729-2215													0301-4797	1095-8630				JAN 15	2023	326		A						116707	10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.116707	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.116707		NOV 2022						36375436					WOS:000886983500003

However, little is known about temporal lake nutrient retention efficiency and it varies due to changes in hydrological, ecological, and nutrient inputs to lake waters. Quantitative information about seasonal lake N and P retention is critical for developing strategies to reduce eutrophication in lake systems. This study investigated TN and TP retention efficiencies and retention masses using water and mass balance calculations, and statistically analyzed the seasonal variability of nutrient retention in Lake Chaohu, China, from 2014 to 2018. Lake Chaohu experienced large amounts of external loads inputs (23.2 g N m(-2) year(-1)and 1.3 g P m(-2) year(-1)), and approximately 58% TN and 48% TP were retained annually. The lake acted more as a sink for N than for P. The mean annual TP retention efficiency decreased (P < 0.05) over the study period, indicating that TP retention capacity was gradually exceeded. Seasonal variability of TN and TP retention efficiency was high and ranged from - 18.7 to 144.1% and from - 58.8 to 170.7%, respectively, over the five study years. The internal P loads over the study period were equivalent to roughly 9% of the total external loads. The annual nutrient retention efficiency of TN and TP increased with hydraulic residence time, while water temperature was an essential factor for the contrasting seasonal variation patterns of TN and TP retention efficiencies.

Below-ground plant traits influence tundra plant acquisition of newly thawed permafrost nitrogen	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The release of permafrost-derived nitrogen (N) has the potential to fertilize tundra vegetation, which in turn may stimulate productivity and thus offset carbon (C) losses from thawing permafrost. Below-ground plant traits may mediate ecosystem response to permafrost thaw and associated feedbacks to the atmosphere by differentially conferring access to deep, newly thawed permafrost N. Yet, identifying roots and quantifying root N uptake from deep, cold soils in complex plant communities has proved challenging to date. We investigated plant acquisition of experimentally added N-15 isotope tracer applied at the permafrost boundary in graminoid- and shrub-dominated tundra at Eight Mile Lake, Alaska, when the thaw front was close to its maximum depth, simulating the release of newly thawed permafrost N. We used molecular tools to verify species and estimate biomass, nitrogen, and isotope pools. Root biomass depth distributions follow an asymptotic relationship with depth, typical of other ecosystems. Few species had roots occurring close to the thaw front. Rubus chamaemorus, a short-statured non-mycorrhizal forb, and Carex bigelowii, a sedge, consistently had the deepest roots. Twenty-four hours after isotope addition, we observed that deep-rooted, non-mycorrhizal species had the highest N-15 enrichment values in their fine root tissue indicating that they access deep N late in the growing season when the thaw front is deepest. Deep-rooted plants are therefore able to immediately take up newly thawed permafrost-derived N. During the following growing season, herbaceous, non-mycorrhizal plants allocated tracer above-ground before woody, mycorrhizal plants. Ectomycorrhizal deciduous and ericoid mycorrhizal evergreen shrubs, by contrast, did not have immediate access to the deep N tracer and assimilated it into new foliar tissue gradually over the following growing season. Synthesis. Graminoids and forbs that have immediate access to deep N represent a modest C sink compared to C emissions from thawing permafrost. However, the effects of deep N fertilization on shrubs over longer time-scales may stimulate productivity and account for a more considerable N and C sink, thus constraining the permafrost C-climate feedback.

Microcystin congeners in Lake Erie follow the seasonal pattern of nitrogen availability	HARMFUL ALGAE												Cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms produce many toxic secondary metabolites called cyanotoxins. The most studied group of cyanotoxins are microcystins (MC), with over 300 congeners reported. MC-LR is the most studied congener because of its abundance and toxicity. Recent toxicology studies suggest that more hydrophobic MC congeners such as MC-LA, MC-LF, and MC-LW may be less abundant but up to seven times more toxic than MC-LR, whereas, MC-RR's toxicity is only one-fifth that of MC-LR. Hence, understanding the environmental stressors that change the MC congener profile is critical to assessing the negative impact on environmental and human health. A two-year field and experimental study investigated seasonal and spatial changes of MC congener profiles in the western basin of Lake Erie. Both studies showed that nitrogen enrichment favored the production of nitrogen-rich MC-RR (C49H75N13O12). The field study showed that nitrogen depletion favored the low-nitrogen MC-LA (C46H67N7O12). MC-LR (a medium N level, C49H75N10O12) accounted for similar to 30% to 50% of the total MC concentration and was stable across nitrogen concentrations. Using the relative toxicity and concentrations of each MC congener, both LC-MS/MS and ELISA overestimated the toxicity early bloom (July) and underestimated it late bloom (September). On 24 July 2019, highly toxic MC-LW and MC-LF were detected at nearshore stations with relative toxicity exceeding drinking water standards. This study demonstrated that the less toxic, high nitrogen MC-RR dominated under nitrogen-replete conditions in the early season, whereas the more toxic, less nitrogen MC-LA dominated under nitrogen-limited conditions later in the season.

J.; Luo, Lifeng			Climate change and water security in the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains	GEOGRAPHY AND SUSTAINABILITY												Water security is under threat worldwide from climate change. A warming climate would accelerate evaporation and cryosphere melting, leading to reduced water availability and unpredictable water supply. However, the water crisis in the Northern Slope of Tianshan Mountains (NSTM) faces dual challenges because water demands for fast-growing urban areas have put heavy pressure on water resources. The mountain-oasis-desert system features glacier-fed rivers that sustain intensive water use in the oasis and end in the desert as fragile terminal lakes. The complex balance between water conservation and economic development is subtle. This paper investigates changes in hydroclimatic variables and water security-related issues on the NSTM. The spatiotemporal variations in glaciers, climatic variables, rivers, lakes and reservoirs, groundwater, surface water, human water use, and streamflow were analyzed for the past four decades. The results show that temperature in the NSTM exhibited an apparent upward trend with a more significant warming rate in the higher altitude regions. Glacier mass loss and shrinkage was strong. The average annual streamflow increased from 1980-1989 to 2006-2011 at most hydrological stations. The monthly dynamics of surface water area showed notable variability at both inter annual and seasonal scales, revealing the impacts of both natural and anthropogenic drivers on surface water availability in the region. The terrestrial water storage anomaly showed a decreasing trend, which might be related to groundwater pumping for irrigation. Human water use for agriculture and industry grew with the increase in cultivated land area and gross domestic product (GDP). The increased agricultural water use was strongly associated with the expansion of oases. It is unclear whether water availability would remain high under future climatic and hydrological uncertainties, posing challenges to water management. In the context of rapid urban growth and climate change, balancing water for humans and nature is vital in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in NSTM. This study provides a baseline understanding of the interplay among water, climate change, and socio-economic development in NSTM. It would also shed light on wise water management under environmental changes for other rapidly developing mountain-oasis-desert systems worldwide.

It is anticipated that climate warming will degrade both types of frozen ground, altering groundwater discharge to streams. While the effects of permafrost degradation on groundwater discharge have been analyzed, quantification of how groundwater discharge in degrading permafrost differs from that in SFG is lacking. This study simulates coupled groundwater and heat transport under freeze-thaw conditions for four representative hillslopes underlain by either continuous permafrost or SFG and compares groundwater discharge outputs under projected warming scenarios over decadal scales. Model results show that without warming there is more groundwater discharge in hillslopes with SFG than permafrost. After a century of warming, groundwater discharge increases for both kinds of frozen ground, but permafrost experiences a larger increase than SFG. These findings have implications for aquatic ecosystems and prioritizing water resource planning.

We review the present advances in understanding the governing physical processes in seasonally ice-covered lakes. Emphasis is placed on the general description of the main physical mechanisms that distinguish the ice-covered season from open water conditions. Physical properties of both ice cover and ice-covered water column are considered. For the former, growth and decay of the seasonal ice, its structure, mechanical and optical properties are discussed. The latter subject deals with circulation and mixing under ice. The relative contribution of the two major circulation drivers, namely heat release from sediment and solar heating, is used for classifying the typical circulation and mixing patterns under ice. In order to provide a physical basis for lake ice phenology, the heat transfer processes related to formation and melting of the seasonal ice cover are discussed in a separate section. Since the ice-covered period in lakes remains poorly investigated to date, this review aims at elaborating an effective strategy for future research based on modern field and modeling methods.

To understand the long-term changes of the surface water area in the Hetao Plain, we used all available Landsat images (7534 scenes) and adopted the modified Normalized Difference Water Index (mNDWI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to map the open-surface water from 1989 to 2019 in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. We further analyzed precipitation, temperature, and irrigated area, revealing the impact of climate change and human activities on long-term surface water changes. The results show the following. (1) In the last 31 years, the maximum, seasonal, and annual average water body area values in the Hetao Plain have exhibited a downward trend. Meanwhile, the number of maximum, seasonal, and permanent water bodies displayed a significant upward trend. (2) The variation of the surface water area in the Hetao Plain is mainly affected by the maximum water body area, while the variation of the water body number is mainly affected by the number of minimum water bodies. (3) Precipitation has statistically significant positive effects on the water body area and water body number, which has statistically significant negative effects with temperature and irrigation. The findings of this study can be used to help the policy-makers and farmers understand changing water resources and its driving mechanism and provide a reference for water resources management, agricultural irrigation, and ecological protection.					; chen, cheng/JVZ-5931-2024; Xia, Haoming/J-4390-2014	Qin, Yaochen/0000-0002-6962-8838; Pan, Li/0009-0005-7805-6412; Xia, Haoming/0000-0003-0106-6709														2073-4441				NOV	2020	12	11							3010	10.3390/w12113010	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12113010													WOS:000594956600001

Downscaled future climate data from HadCM3 of A2 (medium-high) and B2 (medium-low) emission scenarios were compared to the observed climate data for a baseline period (1961-1990). The emission scenario representing the baseline period was used to predict future climate and as input to a hydrologic model to estimate the impact of future climate on the streamflow at three future time horizons: 2020-2045, 2045-2070 and 2070-2100. Results suggest that medium-high emission scenario best represents the local rainfall and temperature pattern. With A2 scenario, daily maximum/minimum temperature will increase throughout the future time horizons. The minimum and maximum temperature will increase by 3.6 degrees C and 2.4 degrees C, respectively, towards the end of the 21st century. Consequently, potential evapotranspiration is expected to increase by 7.8%, although trends in annual rainfall do not show statistically meaningful trends between years. A notable seasonality was found in the rainfall pattern, such that dry season rainfall amounts are likely to increase and wet season rainfall to decrease. The hydrological model indicated that the local hydrology of the study watersheds will be significantly influenced by climate change. Overall, at the end of the century, streamflow will increase in both rivers by up to 64% in dry seasons and decrease by 19% in wet seasons.

Jesse			Characterising and predicting cyanobacterial blooms in an 8-year amplicon sequencing time course	ISME JOURNAL												Cyanobacterial blooms occur in lakes worldwide, producing toxins that pose a serious public health threat. Eutrophication caused by human activities and warmer temperatures both contribute to blooms, but it is still difficult to predict precisely when and where blooms will occur. One reason that prediction is so difficult is that blooms can be caused by different species or genera of cyanobacteria, which may interact with other bacteria and respond to a variety of environmental cues. Here we used a deep 16S amplicon sequencing approach to profile the bacterial community in eutrophic Lake Champlain over time, to characterise the composition and repeatability of cyanobacterial blooms, and to determine the potential for blooms to be predicted based on time course sequence data. Our analysis, based on 135 samples between 2006 and 2013, spans multiple bloom events. We found that bloom events significantly alter the bacterial community without reducing overall diversity, suggesting that a distinct microbial community-including non-cyanobacteria-prospers during the bloom. We also observed that the community changes cyclically over the course of a year, with a repeatable pattern from year to year. This suggests that, in principle, bloom events are predictable. We used probabilistic assemblages of OTUs to characterise the bloom-associated community, and to classify samples into bloom or non-bloom categories, achieving up to 92% classification accuracy (86% after excluding cyanobacterial sequences). Finally, using symbolic regression, we were able to predict the start date of a bloom with 78-92% accuracy (depending on the data used for model training), and found that sequence data was a better predictor than environmental variables.

Biological and chemical monitoring of the ecological risks of pesticides in Lake Ziway, Ethiopia	CHEMOSPHERE												Lake Ziway, a freshwater lake located in Ethiopia, is under the pressure of pesticide and nutrient pollution due to agricultural activity and urbanization. This study has analysed concentrations of insecticides, fungicides and nutrients in water and sediment samples of Lake Ziway taken in the wet and dry season at 13 sites expected to be under different environmental stress and assessed their expected ecological impacts. Malathion, dimethoate, metalaxyl, diazinon, chlorpyrifos, fenitrothion and endosulfan were detected in more than half of the water samples, while diazinon, alpha-cypermethrin and endosulfan were frequently detected (>25%) in sediment samples. Higher levels of physicochemical parameters were observed at sample locations proximate to agricultural and urban activities. Risk quotients (RQ) and multi-substance Potentially Affected Fraction (msPAF(RA)) were calculated to assess the ecological risk of individual and mixture of pesticides, respectively. The majority of the pesticides detected in the water of the lake showed a potential acute risk (RQ > 1), specifically the insecticides chlorpyrifos, lambda-cyhalothrin and alpha-cypermethrin for which high potential acute risks were calculated using a 2nd tier risk assessment. Levels of pesticides in sediment showed low ecological risks. Arthropods and fishes are expected to be highly affected by mixtures of pesticides (msPAF(RA) = < 1-80%) detected at locations that are proximate to smallholders' farms, and receive largescale farms' wastewater and at sites where inflow rivers join the lake. Macroinvertebrates based redundancy analysis showed the effectiveness of EPT richness to assess ecological status of the lake. Training for smallholder farmers on pesticides safety and usage, and implementation of improved effluent management mechanisms by floriculture farms are urgently needed intervention measures to reduce the pollution.

J	Tesfamariam, BG; Gessesse, B; Melgani, F				Tesfamariam, Birhane Gebrehiwot; Gessesse, Berhan; Melgani, Farid			Characterizing the spatiotemporal distribution of meteorological drought as a response to climate variability: The case of rift valley lakes basin of Ethiopia	WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES												Climate variability and recurrent meteorological droughts frequently affect the rain-dependent Ethiopian agriculture, where the rift valley lakes basin is one of the most drought-prone regions in the country. The aim of this study was to evaluate climate variability and characterize the spatiotemporal distribution of meteorological droughts using a merged satellite-gauge rainfall across the major agroecological zones (AEZs) of the rift valley lakes basin. To this end, coefficient of variation (CV) and standardized rainfall anomaly (SRA) were used to evaluate rainfall variability; Mann-Kendell test was used to examine trends of temperature and rainfall; and a grid-rainfall based standardized precipitation index (SPI) was used to assess the spatiotemporal distribution and severity of meteorological droughts. The SPI was computed for 37 years over 1981-2017 at 3-month and 4-month timescales for the bimodal rainy seasons. Finally, a higher inter-annual and spatial variability of rainfall and frequent meteorological droughts were found across the basin. Compared to the nationally documented historical drought years in the country, more frequent drought events were found in this basin, signifying its higher vulnerability to climate variability. As a result, between 1981 and 2017, the basin has partially experienced at least a moderate drought intensity on average every 1.68 and 1.76 years during the 'Belg' and 'Kiremt' season, respectively. Drought frequency was higher at the 'Kolla' AEZ, characterized by the highest CV of rainfall. Furthermore, these frequent droughts were accompanied by significant rising trends in monthly temperature. Such a warming trend, in this inherently warm area, coupled with expected global climate change scenarios could further aggravate drought conditions in the future. Moreover, the spatiotemporal distribution of drought events was found to be variable between and within AEZs in the basin so that more localized drought adaptation strategies could help to alleviate potential impacts. Thus, the drought history of each agroecological zone and the spatiotemporal distributions of recent droughts, this study has delivered, could enhance the awareness of concerned decision makers in tracing frequently affected locations, which could in turn enable them to design and implement improved water management techniques as a means of drought mitigation strategy.					; Melgani, Farid/A-7076-2013	Gebrehiwot, Birhane/0000-0002-2819-7875; 													2212-0947					DEC	2019	26								100237	10.1016/j.wace.2019.100237	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wace.2019.100237													WOS:000500552500015

Numerous studies have used remote sensing technology to monitor such changes. However, most of studies were conducted at low spatial resolutions (250-1000 m) or low temporal resolutions (few images per year), which can introduce a degree of unreliability as regards the associated con-clusions. To thoroughly analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of Dongting Lake wetland, high spatiotem-poral resolution images from 2001 to 2020 have been produced by a modified version of the flexible spatiotemporal data fusion method (cuFSDAF 2.0) developed in this paper. This method is able to retrieve both phenology and land-cover changes both quickly and accurately. In addition, a tailored category by category extraction mapping method (CCEMM) is proposed to reliably classify wetland cover types. The mapping results show that the water area expanded by 66.43 Km2 in the wet season, and shrank by 132.86 Km2 in the dry season, between and including the years, 2001 to 2020. It appeared that the water area in the dry season declined obviously from 2003 to 2010 due to the operation of the TGD and is gradually stabilized after 2010. The reed area increased by 279.59 Km2 and the grass area decreased by 220.46 Km2 in the dry season, from 2001 to 2020. The shrinkage of the water area in the dry season may be one of the main factors driving reeds to occupy the previous grass growth area.					wang, shujuan/MCX-4081-2025; cai, cai/IUN-8747-2023														1574-9541	1878-0512				DEC	2022	72								101848	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101848	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101848		OCT 2022											WOS:000930713300003

However, the effect of thermal stratification on denitrifying bacterial community is still unclear. Here, we investigated the dynamics of nirS gene abundance and the structure and composition of nirS-type denitrifying bacterial community in a deep drinking water reservoir by quantitative PCR and high-throughput sequencing, respectively. The results showed that the abundance of nirS gene was approximately 105 copies/mL, and it was significantly higher in the metalimnion and hypolimnion than that of the epilimnion layer. Proteobacteria was the predominant phylum, with high abundance of the members of Burkholderiales and Rhodocyclales at order level. Twenty dominant genera were detected in the sequences analyzed among them five genera accounted for approximately 92% of classified sequences. The network analysis (NKA) showed that the co-existence and the interaction among the nirS-type denitrifying bacteria in the Jinpen Reservoir may be crucial for the regulation of the nitrogen-cycle and water quality. Structural equation model (SEM) illustrated that temperature and dissolved oxygen had great impact on the nirS-type denitrifying bacterial community during thermal stratification. Taking together, these results provide new evidence for the ecological distribution of nirS-type denitrifying bacterial community in reservoir ecosystem, reinforcing the recent findings on the linkages between the environmental factors and denitrifying bacterial community interactions in a deep drinking water reservoir during stratification.					liu, kaiwen/GVS-5259-2022														0022-1694	1879-2707				MAY	2021	596								126090	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126090	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126090		FEB 2021											WOS:000642334400061

A total of 416 samples were collected over a 1.5-year sampling period (September 1999- February 2001) from six rivers and ten lakes. The water samples were analyzed with an off-line solid phase extraction technique coupled with a gas chromatography ion trap mass spectrometer using an analytical method for 147 pesticides and their metabolites, including organochlorines, organophosphates, triazines, chloroacetanilides, pyrethroids, carbamates, phthalimides and other pesticides (herbicides, insecticides and fungicides). Based on the pesticide survey results, a human health carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risk assessment was conducted for adults and children. Ecotoxicological risk assessment was also conducted using default endpoint values and the risk quotient method. Results showed that the herbicides metolachlor, prometryn, alachlor and molinate, were the most frequently detected pesticides (29%, 12.5%, 12.5% and 10%, respectively). They also exhibited the highest concentration values, often exceeding 1 mu g/L. Chlorpyrifos ethyl was the most frequently detected insecticide (7%). Seasonal variations in measured pesticide concentrations were observed in all rivers and lakes. The highest concentrations were recorded during May-June period, right after pesticide application. Concentrations of six pesticides were above the maximum allowable limit of 0.1 mu g/L set for drinking water. Alachlor, atrazine and a-HCH showed unacceptable carcinogenic risk estimates (4.5E-06, 4.6E-06 and 1.3E-04, respectively). Annual average concentrations of chlorpyriphos ethyl (0.031 mu gL), dicofol (0.01 mu g/L), dieldrin (0.02 mu g/L) and endosulfan a (0.065 mu g/L) exceeded the EU environmental quality standards. The risk quotient estimates for the insecticides chorpyrifos ethyl, diazinon and parathion methyl and herbicide prometryn were above acceptable risk values. The coupling of monitoring data to probabilistic human and ecotoxicological risk estimates could find use by Greek regulatory authorities, proposing effective pollution management schemes.

Temperature increase and fluctuation induce phytoplankton biodiversity loss - Evidence from a multi-seasonal mesocosm experiment	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Global climate change scenarios predict lake water temperatures to increase up to 4 degrees C and extreme weather events, including heat waves and large temperature fluctuations, to occur more frequently. Such changes may result in a reorganization of the plankton community structure, causing shifts in diversity and structure toward a community dominated by fewer species that are more adapted to endure warmer and irregular temperature conditions. We designed a long-term (8 months) mesocosm experiment to explore how ambient water temperature (C: control), induced increased temperature (T: +4 degrees C), and temperature fluctuations (F: +/- 4 degrees C relative to T) change phytoplankton phenology, taxonomical diversity, and community structure, and how such changes affected zooplankton abundance and composition. Synthesis. Our results show that T and F relative to C significantly decreased phytoplankton diversity. Moreover, there was a clear effect of the temperature treatments (T and F) on phytoplankton size structure that resulted in a significantly lower growth of large species (i.e., large Chlorophyta) compared to C. Decreased diversity and evenness in the T and F treatments pushed the community toward the dominance of only a few phytoplankton taxa (mainly Cyanobacteria and Chlorophyta) that are better adapted to endure warmer and more irregular temperature conditions. The observed shift toward Cyanobacteria dominance may affect trophic energy transfer along the aquatic food web.

The seasonal and spatial variations of the 22 target PPCPs were analyzed in the 63 sampling sites along the whole Beiyun River Basin. Results showed that the total PPCPs concentration had a wide variation range, from 132 ng L-1 to 25474 ng L-1. Spatial interpolation analysis showed that agricultural land presented higher PPCPs contamination level than build-up land (p 0.05) and the concentration was negatively correlated with urbanization level. Source apportionment showed the untreated sewage source contributed to 34%-53% of the PPCPs burden in the Beiyun River. Risk assessment indicated that diethyltoluamide, carbamazepine, octocrylene, gemfibrozil and triclocarban had high risks (RQ 1), and small tributaries had the highest mixed risk (MRQ = 34). Species sensitivity distribution combined with the safety threshold method showed that PPCPs would have potential risk on aquatic organisms even at very low concentrations and triclocarban posed the highest risk in the Beiyun River.

The concentrations of the antibiotics in the sediment and water were not detected (ND)-193,440 ng kg(-1) and ND-694 ng L-1, respectively, and ofloxacin was identified as the main antibiotic. The target antibiotics were identified at decreased levels in the study area compared with the inflowing rivers of other lakes. The decreased antibiotic concentrations resulted from the dilution effect, strong biodegradation, and rapid photolysis during the wet season. The spatial variations were due to the differences in regional contributions; the concentrations of antibiotics from lining and Peixian were the highest. Antibiotic pollution in different seasons originated from different sources; pollution levels were determined by water levels and rainfall as well as complicated runoff generation and confluence mechanisms. Based on the risk quotients, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole and sulfadiazine were identified as the main antibiotics that contributed to high ecological risks. Algae and aquatic plants were the main model organisms exposed to these risks. This study has great significance for environmental prevention and the control of antibiotic contamination in Nansi Lake, which is an important water transport channel and the main impounded lake for the eastern route of the south-to-north water diversion project.

Balancing Hydropower Development and Ecological Impacts in the Mekong: Tradeoffs for Sambor Mega Dam	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												Home to one of the world's most biodiverse and productive freshwater fisheries, the Mekong River basin provides food and economic security to some 60million people. The extensive hydropower development planned for the river basin has the potential to degrade this ecosystem. The basin's potentially most impactful and downstream-most proposed main stem dam, the 18-km-long Sambor Dam is to be located just upstream of critical nursery and fishery habitats of the Tonle Sap Lake and the Mekong Delta and just downstream of major spawning areas. We explore the potential to modify Sambor's siting, design, and operation (SDO) to balance hydropower and ecological outcomes. Our results demonstrate that there are opportunities to achieve more balanced ecology-energy outcomes. We use probabilistic seasonal measures of fish life cycle processes, energy production, and sediment passage to explore alternative SDO options. We consider both ecological concerns and energy production on equal footing prior to any power purchase agreements or fixed designs for Sambor, which is a first among any of the world's large dams. The Sambor Ecological Alternative (Sambor EA) dam considered in this study includes a combination of design and operational features to improve sediment and fish passage that do not exist at any of the world's large hydropower dams. Yet Sambor EA still poses a significant risk to the Mekong fishery and the millions who depend on it, given the appreciable uncertainty surrounding its potential ecological outcomes. Our results emphasize the need to address ecological concerns in advance of signing power purchase agreements that would otherwise limit the site-specific and integrated SDO modifications needed to achieve them. Our results also emphasize the importance of, and challenges in, carefully defining ecological performance measures and criteria, as well as the importance of carefully sampling reservoir operation possibilities.					; Reed, Patrick/E-4435-2014	Wild, Thomas/0000-0002-6045-7729; 													0733-9496	1943-5452				FEB	2019	145	2							05018019	10.1061/(ASCE)WR.1943-5452.0001036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)WR.1943-5452.0001036													WOS:000453220300012

Changes in proportion of total particulate phosphorus (TPP) and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) might accelerate lake eutrophication, but limited attention has been paid to P partition over suspended particle (SP) levels. Data analysis showed that SP concentration presented a positive effect on TPP in wet season and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) in dry season, indicating seasonal physical and chemical variations. Based on this phenomenon, we proposed a hypothesis that the SP levels would affect TDP and TPP proportions by partition in aqueous-solid. It was found that using the parabola models to fit the sorption relationships of SRP and TDP (R-2 > 0.6, p < 0.01), the maximum sorption capacity (Q(max)) was 64.54 mg/kg and 60.52 mg/kg at 400 mg/L of SP level, respectively. In addition, the partition coefficients (K-P) of TDP and SRP were logarithmically increased with SP levels, indicating that higher SP levels (>400 mg/L) would hinder the sorption process. Furthermore, enhancing turbulence lead to less sorption of SRP and TDP at high SP levels (>800 mg/L). The sorption of SRP and TDP related to the presence of Fe/Al oxyhydroxides were enriched in the Fe/Al-P fraction (47% of TP). The findings of this study indicated that the low SP levels would increase P bioavailability for alga and is not conducive for lake eutrophication management. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, thermal tourism facilities in the upstream region are also degrading water quality of Felent Stream. This study meticulously examined the levels and spatial-temporal variations of 18 potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in the sediments of the Felent Stream Basin and evaluated their ecotoxicological risks during dry and wet seasons. The average sediments contamination levels of PTEs were ranked as follows: Fe > Al > Zn > Mn > Sr > Pb > Ba > Ni > Cu > As > Cr > Li > V > Cd > Co > Sb > Se > Hg. Remarkably, during the wet season, sediment samples revealed an approximate threefold surge in the average concentrations of PTEs. Ecological risk assessment indicators highlighted that the basin experienced low pollution levels in the dry season, escalating to moderate pollution levels during the wet season. Non-carcinogenic risks for studied PTEs and carcinogenic risks for As remained below the threshold values in both seasons. Statistical analyses pinpointed the Yoncal & imath; District, a prominent thermal tourism area, as the primary contributor to the sediment contamination of the Felent Stream Basin. The Enne Dam Lake, the region's main stagnant water body, emerged as the least contaminated component, functioning as a natural filter for the basin and significantly mitigating the levels of PTEs in the sediment.

Remote Analysis of the Chlorophyll-a Concentration Using Sentinel-2 MSI Images in a Semiarid Environment in Northeastern Brazil	WATER												In this paper, the authors use remote-sensing images to monitor the water quality of reservoirs located in the semiarid region of Northeast Brazil. Sentinel-2 MSI TOA Level 1C reflectance images were used to remotely estimate the concentration of chlorophyll-a (chl-a), the main indicator of the trophic state of aquatic environments, in five reservoirs in the state of Ceara, Brazil. A three-spectral band retrieval model was calibrated using 171 water samples, collected from November 2015 through July 2018 in 5 reservoirs. For validation, 71 additional samples, collected from August 2018 through December 2019, were used to ensure a robust accuracy assessment. The TOA Level 1C products performed very well, achieving a relative RMSE of 28% and R-2 = 0.80. Data on wind direction and speed, solar radiation and reservoir volume were used to generate a conceptual model to analyze the behavior of chl-a in the surface waters of the Castanhao reservoir. During 2019, the reservoir water quality showed strong variation, with concentration fluctuating from 30 to 95 mu g/L We showed that the end of the dry season is marked by strong eutrophic conditions corresponding to very low water inflows into the reservoir. During the rainy season there is a large decrease in the chl-a concentration following the increase of the lake water storage. During the following dry season, satellite data show a progressive improvement of the trophic state controlled by wind intensity that promotes a better mixing of the reservoir waters and inhibiting the development of most phytoplankton.					; Martins, Eduardo/H-7228-2013; Martinez, Jean-Michel/AAK-4410-2020; Souza, Enio/G-3233-2012; PASSOS RODRIGUES MARTINS, EDUARDO SAVIO/H-7228-2013	Benevides Aranha, Thais/0000-0002-8088-5253; Souza, Enio P./0000-0001-6154-398X; Martinez, Jean-Michel/0000-0003-3281-8512; Barros, Mario/0000-0001-5763-8951; PASSOS RODRIGUES MARTINS, EDUARDO SAVIO/0000-0002-9858-2541														2073-4441				FEB	2022	14	3							451	10.3390/w14030451	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14030451													WOS:000755253400001
J	Li, JH; Pu, JB; Zhang, T				Li, Jianhong; Pu, Junbing; Zhang, Tao			Transport and transformation of dissolved inorganic carbon in a subtropical groundwater-fed reservoir, south China	WATER RESEARCH												Most reservoirs in subtropical areas experience periodic variations in the thermal structure of their water columns, with times of strong thermal stratification being succeeded by periods of mixing, over the course of the year. Understanding of the transport and transformation of dissolved inorganic carbon over such thermal cycles in artificial reservoirs remains poor. To address this problem, this study examined the spatiotemporal behavior of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2), carbon isotope ratios (813CDIC), and CO2 emission (FCO2), from 2014 to 2018 in a subtropical, groundwater-fed reservoir in southern China. It was found that CO2 emissions during mixing periods are much higher than in thermally stratified periods (particularly during transition from stratified to mixing) as a result of upwelling and release of dissolved CO2 (CO2aq) accumulated in the hypolimnion. CO2 emission fluxes at the water-gas interface accounted for only a small proportion of the DIC in the reservoir. The relationships between of DIC and 813CDIC displayed two distinct modes, due to spatial differences in water depths and to strong thermal stratification during warmer seasons: (1) DIC concentrations increase and 813CDIC values decrease from epilimnion to hypolimnion, and (2) 813CDIC values decrease with increasing DIC concentrations but 813CDIC is progressively enriched near the bottom during periods of thermal stratification. In addition, this study found three distinct processes of DIC accumulation and consumption in the reservoir: (1) DIC accumulated in the hypolimnion during thermal stratification periods, due to carbon retention but (2) DIC was substantially consumed in the epilimnion during such periods, and (3) average DIC concentrations and pCO2 increased significantly from upstream to downstream along the reservoir, while average 813CDIC values became lighter. These results highlight that carbon behavior in groundwater-fed reservoirs is often controlled by a combination of biogeochemical processes and seasonal variations in thermal structure. Sampling and monitoring strategies should consider these factors in order to accurately estimate carbon budgets in reservoirs, lakes or ponds.					li, jianhong/D-3483-2009; Zhang, Tao/ACM-0777-2022; Pu, Junbing/A-8609-2015														0043-1354	1879-2448				FEB 1	2022	209								117905	10.1016/j.watres.2021.117905	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.117905								34894443					WOS:000758687400008

Bacterioplankton from the surface waters of a subtropical urban reservoir in southeast China were analyzed through high-frequency sampling over 13 months to compare patterns and ecological processes between short (08 weeks), medium (924 weeks) and long (2553 weeks) time intervals. We classified the bacterial community into different subcommunities: abundant taxa (AT); conditionally rare taxa (CRT); rare taxa (RT). CRT contributed > 65% of the alpha-diversity, and temporal change of beta-diversities was more pronounced for AT and CRT than RT. The bacterial community exhibited a directional change in the short- and medium-time intervals and a convergent dynamic during the long-time interval due to a seasonal cycle. Cyanobacteria exhibited a strong succession pattern than other phyla. CRT accounted for > 76% of the network nodes in three stations. The bacteria-environment relationship and deterministic processes were stronger for large sample size at station G (n = 116) than small sample size at stations C (n = 12) and L (n = 22). These findings suggest that a high-frequency sampling approach can provide a better understanding on the time scales at which bacterioplankton can change fast between being abundant or rare, thus providing the facts about environmental factors driving microbial community dynamics. Patterns and processes in alpha- and beta-diversities and community assembly of bacterioplankton differ among different time intervals (short-, medium- and long-time intervals) and different subcommunities (abundant, conditionally rare and rare taxa) in a subtropical urban reservoir, demonstrating the importance of temporal scale and high-frequency sampling in microbial community ecology.

Arctic concentration-discharge relationships for dissolved organic carbon and nitrate vary with landscape and season	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Climate change is intensifying the Arctic hydrologic cycle, potentially accelerating the release of carbon and nutrients from permafrost landscapes to rivers. However, there are limited riverine flow and solute data of adequate frequency and duration to test how seasonality and catchment landscape characteristics influence production and transport of carbon and nutrients in Arctic river networks. We measured high frequency hydrochemical dynamics at the outlets of three headwater catchments in Arctic Alaska over 3 years. The catchments represent common Arctic landscapes: low-gradient tundra, low-gradient and lake-influenced tundra, and high-gradient alpine tundra. Using in-situ spectrophotometers, we measured dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate (NO3-) concentrations at 15-min intervals through the flow seasons of 2017, 2018, and 2019. These high-frequency data allowed us to quantify concentration-discharge (C-Q) responses during individual storm events across the flow season. Differences in C-Q responses among catchments indicated strong landscape and seasonal controls on lateral DOC and NO3- flux. For the two low-gradient tundra catchments, we observed consistent DOC enrichment (transport-limitation) and NO3- dilution (source-limitation) during flow events. Conversely, we found consistent NO3- enrichment and DOC dilution in the high-gradient alpine catchment. Our analysis revealed how high flow events may contribute disproportionately to downstream export in these Arctic streams. Because the duration of the flow season is expected to lengthen and the intensity of Arctic storms are expected to increase, understanding how discharge and solute concentration are coupled is crucial to understanding carbon and nutrient dynamics in rapidly changing permafrost ecosystems.					; Zarnetske, Jay/F-4685-2010; Abbott, Benjamin/G-1733-2017; Iannucci, Frances/MZS-1713-2025	Bowden, William/0000-0002-0150-5356; Iannucci, Frances/0000-0002-7554-1819; Zarnetske, Jay/0000-0001-7194-5245; Abbott, Benjamin/0000-0001-5861-3481; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2021	66			1	SI		S197	S215		10.1002/lno.11682	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11682		DEC 2020											WOS:000603745700001

We present a performance evaluation of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding with MiFish-U/E primers to investigate local and regional diversities of stream fish species to examine potential effectiveness, limits and future remedies of this technique in large-scale monitoring. We hypothesised that eDNA inferences are more consistent with fish assemblages observed upstream than downstream due to a directional flow of river water. 2. River water was sampled at 102 sites in 51 rivers around Lake Biwa in the central part of Honshu Island, Japan, within 10 person-days, and fish species compositions inferred from eDNA and existing observational data were compared. Observation sites were chosen from the observational data that were within a certain distance (buffer range) of a water-sampling site along a river trajectory. The hypothesis of the detection bias of eDNA towards upstream assemblage was tested by comparing results with all of the observational data, data from a higher elevation and data from a lower elevation. The Jaccard dissimilarity index was plotted between the observational data and the eDNA estimates against the buffer range; the buffer range with minimum dissimilarity was chosen. 3. When using existing observational data from within 6 km upstream of the eDNA sampling sites, the eDNA results were the most consistent with the observational data and inferred 86.4% of the species reported (38/44), as well as two additional species. eDNA results also showed patterns consistent with known upstream-downstream turnover of related species and biogeographical assemblage patterns of certain species. 4. Our 10-person-days survey using the metabarcoding technique enabled us to obtain as much regional fish diversity data including the hypothesised pattern of eDNA detection with an upstream bias as the accumulated observational data obtained through greater amounts of time, money and labour. The problems regarding false-positive/negative detection were suggested in our survey; however, these should be decreased or removed by modifying the sampling methods and experimental procedures in future works. Therefore, we concluded this new tool to enable monitoring that has never been implemented, such as cross-nation, and even whole-Earth monitoring with the data at yearly, seasonal or finer temporal scales.

An accurate and robust method to extract water bodies is critical to effectively manage these irreplaceable resources. Conventional methods are frequently limited in terms of the uncertainty related to the coarse resolution and regional reflectance heterogeneity of satellite images. The fuzzy clustering method (FCM) considering local spatial information has a proven capability to compensate for these limitations. Nevertheless, this technique is highly sensitive to immense false signals in original satellite images. Therefore, a systematic surface water extraction method by taking advantage of the complementarity between a water index (WI) and a modified FCM (WIMFCM) was designed in this study to improve the water extraction accuracy, the rationale of which is a background reflectance bias correction. Applications were performed to sixteen test sites varying from coasts to inland waters to comprehensively evaluate the reliability of the WIMFCM using the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. Results showed the WIMFCM improved the accuracy of water extraction in comparison to alternative methods in terms of kappa coefficients (KCs) and total classification errors (TEs). Overall, the mean KC of the WIMFCM was 0.94 and its mean TE was 1139%, compared with original WI (KC = 0.89, TE = 19.84%) and a support vector machine (SVM) method (KC = 0.89, TE = 22.39%). In addition, a seasonal analysis revealed the WIMFCM could maintain consistent reliability throughout the year, demonstrating its potential for accurate dynamic water monitoring associated with seasonal water probability mask. Additional tests using Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data revealed the WIMFCM could be extended to large-scale regions, as well as be used in near-real time surface water body extraction. The findings of this study offer a new method to improve target detection accuracy under reflectance heterogeneous environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

First of all, sustainability in the agricultural sector can be achieved through the possible abandonment of traditional mineral fertilizers. Many decades of using these fertilizers have led to the degradation of arable soils and to soil and environmental pollution. As a result, this causes reductions in yields and the environmental quality of agricultural products and affects the health of the population. An alternative to traditional mineral fertilizers may be the use of innovative organomineral fertilizers obtained from local resources. These include manure, humus, compost, sediments, etc. In recent years, fertilizers obtained from the sapropels of the bottom sediments of lakes have become widespread. Their distinctive feature is the environmental friendliness and completeness of the content of chemical elements and substances necessary for the development and growth of plants. In addition, the methods of obtaining and applying these fertilizers allow us to talk about their effectiveness in use. The range of applications of these fertilizers is diverse, from use in the form of a dry extract applied directly to the soil to the use of liquid suspensions used at various stages of processing and from pre-sowing seed treatment to watering and spraying plants at different periods of vegetation. Moreover, an important aspect is the research work on the variational use of sapropel fertilizers on different crops, with different methods of production and concentrations and at different stages of processing. This publication contains the results of a study of the effect of the obtained innovative sapropel fertilizer on productivity, wheat grain quality, and economic efficiency (Triticum aestivum L.). To identify the optimal concentration of sapropel extract, laboratory studies were carried out to determine the germination energy and germination of wheat seeds of different varieties when they were soaked in various concentrations: 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, and 2.0 g/L. The best indicators of germination energy and germination of wheat seeds during treatment with the extract were obtained at a concentration of 1.2 g/L. The research was conducted at an accredited variety testing laboratory. A field experiment was conducted in the fields of the agrobiological station of North Kazakhstan University named after Manash Kozybayev. The treatment of the seeds was carried out by soaking them in sapropel extract to evenly distribute the substance. The scheme of the field experiment included the option of using foliar treatment with a solution of sapropel extract at the tillering stage. As a result of the application of the obtained extract in the field, environmental and socio-economic efficiency was noted. The conducted field studies note its positive effect and effectiveness on the morphological, qualitative, and quantitative indicators of the wheat harvest. In the areas where wheat seeds were pretreated, as well as where foliar treatment with the resulting sapropel suspension was carried out, the best yield indicators were revealed. In these variants of the experiment with pre-sowing and pre-sowing and foliar treatment with the sapropel extract solution, the yield was 3.63 and 3.81 tons per hectare, respectively. The introduction of sapropel extract at the stage of seed treatment before sowing, as well as foliar processing of wheat at the tillering stage, will increase the efficiency and profitability of the agricultural industry and obtain a synergistic effect in the form of socio-economic efficiency and environmental safety of production. In our opinion, this will contribute to the development of sustainable agriculture and the production of environmental products.

Therefore, topo-bathymetry is important to study and protect the aquatic environment of tufa lakes. However, traditional field-based topo-bathymetric surveying methods (e.g., sounding rod or sonar) inevitably disturb the fragile lake ecosystem. In recent years, the emerging remote sensing technology of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) has provided a cost-effective solution for measuring topobathymetry without disturbance. In this paper, taking Spark Lake in Jiuzhaigou, China, as an example, we captured red-green-blue (RGB) images using a fixed-wing UAV and produced a digital elevation model (DEM) prior to the Jiuzhaigou Earthquake using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry. The underwater topography of Spark Lake was obtained by refraction correction and water color inversion based on the DEM and orthophoto, respectively. For refraction correction, a water depth correction model based on Snell's Law was used. For water color inversion, general band ratio models were replaced by a band difference model (blue band-green band). The qualities of the resulting DEMs produced by the two methods were evaluated against the topography of the drained Spark Lake after the earthquake, and the corresponding DEMs of difference (DoD) were also analyzed. The coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) are 0.88 and 1.32 m for refraction correction, and 0.86 and 1.37 m for water color inversion, respectively. The results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of applying UAV-acquired RGB imagery and the two optical remote sensing methods to topo-bathymetric mapping of transparent tufa lakes.

J	Yuan, LL; Pollard, AI				Yuan, Lester L.; Pollard, Amina I.			Changes in the relationship between zooplankton and phytoplankton biomasses across a eutrophication gradient	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The relationship between zooplankton biomass and phytoplankton biomass can provide insight into the structure and function of lake biological communities. We used a Bayesian network model to analyze a continental-scale data set to estimate changes in the relationship between zooplankton (Z) and phytoplankton (P) biomasses along a eutrophication gradient. The Bayesian network model allowed us to combine two different measurements of phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a concentration and directly observed biovolume) to improve the precision of estimates of true biomass within each sample. The model also allowed us to estimate separate relationships between P and zooplankton abundance and between P and mean individual zooplankton biomass and then to combine these two relationships into an estimate of seasonal mean zooplankton biomass. The resulting analysis indicated that seasonal mean zooplankton biomass increased proportionally with phytoplankton biomass in oligotrophic lakes, yielding a constant ratio between Z and P and suggested that bottom-up forces determined zooplankton biomass in these systems. In eutrophic lakes, seasonal mean zooplankton biomass was nearly constant with increases in phytoplankton biomass, yielding a decrease in the ratio between Z and P with increasing eutrophication. Bottom-up forces, as quantified by an increase in the proportion of cyanobacteria, accounted for approximately one fifth of the residual variance in the model as the relationship between Z and P changed from direct proportionality in oligotrophic lakes to the nearly constant value of Z observed in eutrophic lakes, suggesting that a combination of both top-down and bottom-up forces likely determined zooplankton biomass in eutrophic lakes.

J	Hammond, WC; Blewitt, G; Kreemer, C				Hammond, William C.; Blewitt, Geoffrey; Kreemer, Corne			GPS Imaging of vertical land motion in California and Nevada: Implications for Sierra Nevada uplift	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												We introduce Global Positioning System (GPS) Imaging, a new technique for robust estimation of the vertical velocity field of the Earth's surface, and apply it to the Sierra Nevada Mountain range in the western United States. Starting with vertical position time series from Global Positioning System (GPS) stations, we first estimate vertical velocities using the MIDAS robust trend estimator, which is insensitive to undocumented steps, outliers, seasonality, and heteroscedasticity. Using the Delaunay triangulation of station locations, we then apply a weighted median spatial filter to remove velocity outliers and enhance signals common to multiple stations. Finally, we interpolate the data using weighted median estimation on a grid. The resulting velocity field is temporally and spatially robust and edges in the field remain sharp. Results from data spanning 5-20 years show that the Sierra Nevada is the most rapid and extensive uplift feature in the western United States, rising up to 2 mm/yr along most of the range. The uplift is juxtaposed against domains of subsidence attributable to groundwater withdrawal in California's Central Valley. The uplift boundary is consistently stationary, although uplift is faster over the 2011-2016 period of drought. Uplift patterns are consistent with groundwater extraction and concomitant elastic bedrock uplift, plus slower background tectonic uplift. A discontinuity in the velocity field across the southeastern edge of the Sierra Nevada reveals a contrast in lithospheric strength, suggesting a relationship between late Cenozoic uplift of the southern Sierra Nevada and evolution of the southern Walker Lane.																			2169-9313	2169-9356				OCT	2016	121	10					7681	7703		10.1002/2016JB013458	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016JB013458								27917328					WOS:000388441800037

Open data archives as well as developments in cloud computing are the main drivers towards and increased availability of raw data allowing for the extraction of detailed information on water bodies such as natural lakes and artificial reservoirs. At the same time, changes in precipitation patterns, increasing frequency and intensity of droughts, intensification of human water use, and regulatory upstream measurements affect water resources around the world today. With regard to water availability and supply-demand balance, artificial water reservoirs have become most important elements e.g. for hydropower, irrigated agriculture, flood control, as well as for domestic and industrial water use. Nevertheless, publicly accessible information on reservoirs is still not harmonized and available at global scale. Therefore, it is more essential than ever to acquire detailed knowledge about spatio-temporal variability of water resources - especially reservoirs - and the drivers of their dynamics. In this study, we analyze daily water extent time series of the 1267 largest reservoirs worldwide based on the existing DLR-DFD Global WaterPack product derived from MODIS data (Klein et al., 2017). The study aims to present an experimental way of spatio-temporal variability analysis by implementing the TIMESAT software which is usually used for vegetation analyses. In our experimental approach we derive information on the timing when the open surface water areas of reservoirs increase and decrease by identifying start date, end date and duration of such reservoir cycles as well as timing of maximum surface water extent (hydro-metrics). For four selected reservoirs, these hydro-metrics derived from surface water extent are compared with hydro-metrics derived from in-situ water level measurements or altimetry datasets and are discussed in more detail. Based on the presented examples we demonstrate the potential of high temporal resolution surface water extent data and spatio-temporal variability analyses with TIMESAT for future applications supporting the understanding of reservoir variability as a result of water management and hydroclimatic variability.					; Klein, Igor/KJL-2430-2024	Klein, Igor/0000-0003-0113-8637; 													0034-4257	1879-0704				FEB	2021	253								112207	10.1016/j.rse.2020.112207	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.112207													WOS:000604327000003
J	Wu, QS; Lane, CR				Wu, Qiusheng; Lane, Charles R.			Delineating wetland catchments and modeling hydrologic connectivity using lidar data and aerial imagery	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												In traditional watershed delineation and topographic modeling, surface depressions are generally treated as spurious features and simply removed from a digital elevation model (DEM) to enforce flow continuity of water across the topographic surface to the watershed outlets. In reality, however, many depressions in the DEM are actual wetland landscape features with seasonal to permanent inundation patterning characterized by nested hierarchical structures and dynamic filling-spilling-merging surface-water hydrological processes. Differentiating and appropriately processing such ecohydrologically meaningful features remains a major technical terrain-processing challenge, particularly as highresolution spatial data are increasingly used to support modeling and geographic analysis needs. The objectives of this study were to delineate hierarchical wetland catchments and model their hydrologic connectivity using high-resolution lidar data and aerial imagery. The graph-theory-based contour tree method was used to delineate the hierarchical wetland catchments and characterize their geometric and topological properties. Potential hydrologic connectivity between wetlands and streams were simulated using the least-cost-path algorithm. The resulting flow network delineated potential flow paths connecting wetland depressions to each other or to the river network on scales finer than those available through the National Hydrography Dataset. The results demonstrated that our proposed framework is promising for improving overland flow simulation and hydrologic connectivity analysis.					; Wu, Qiusheng/C-7976-2016	Lane, Charles/0000-0003-0066-8919; Wu, Qiusheng/0000-0001-5437-4073													1027-5606	1607-7938				JUL 14	2017	21	7					3579	3595		10.5194/hess-21-3579-2017	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-3579-2017								30147279					WOS:000405660200002

Impact of land use change on hydrological systems: A review of current modeling approaches	COGENT GEOSCIENCE												Hydrologic modeling plays a very important role in assessing the seasonal water availability, which is necessary to take decisions in water resources management. Both climate and land use and land cover change have great influence on the hydrological response of a watershed. The main aim of this study is to provide a detailed review of studies which have been carried out to analyze the hydrological impacts of land use change, and also to evaluate different scenario modeling approaches. In addition, a brief description of basic hydrologic models which are used to simulate the stream flow is provided. This review paper tried to explain the importance of model comparison and performance evaluation in modeling studies. The following conclusions may be drawn from this review: (1) it is necessary to model the possible impacts of land use change and climate change in order to proceed with effective water resources management, (2) it is important to analyze the variation in hydrological response in catchments with different land use characteristics and climatic conditions and also under climate scenarios, and (3) integration of different models with hydrologic models can be considered as an efficient method to forecast future trends in hydrological response.																			2331-2041						2015	1	1							UNSP 1115691	10.1080/23312041.2015.1115691	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23312041.2015.1115691													WOS:000218309500003
J	Overeem, I; Nienhuis, JH; Piliouras, A				Overeem, Irina; Nienhuis, Jaap H.; Piliouras, Anastasia			Ice-dominated Arctic deltas	NATURE REVIEWS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT												Arctic deltas are ice-dominated systems that modulate river fluxes from permafrost terrain to the ocean. This Review provides an overview of the controls, seasonality and processes that give Arctic deltas their unique morphodynamics and the influence of climate change on their future evolution. Arctic deltas form the critical interface between the Arctic landscape and the ocean. They filter freshwater, sediment, carbon and biochemical fluxes from approximately 14 million km(2) of northern permafrost terrain. This Review highlights the unique controlling factors, seasonality and morphodynamic processes affecting Arctic deltas. Arctic deltas are 'ice-dominated systems' that are affected by land ice, permafrost and sea ice. They are strongly seasonal and are frozen for 7-9 months of the year. Permafrost limits channel migration. Arctic deltas experience ice jam floods, inducing biochemical exchange with thermokarst lakes. Transport under sea ice creates shallow prodelta ramps. Open-ocean conditions that promote marine reworking of river deposits are short-lived in the Arctic. A data compilation of Arctic deltas highlights that sediment and carbon fluxes are substantially lower than for lower-latitude deltas, with the exception of Greenlandic deltas. Arctic delta morphodynamics are also markedly subdued, with land-water conversion about eightfold less than in low-latitude deltas, probably owing to the unique ice processes occurring in Arctic deltas, which result in preferential floodplain and submarine sedimentation. Future trajectories of controlling factors indicate that Arctic deltas will transition away from being dominated by ice. The open-water season is expanding most rapidly, with wave energy predicted to increase threefold by 2100. Arctic deltas will thaw and experience increased wave influence, with poorly understood consequences for delta morphodynamics and carbon cycling. Process studies under transitional conditions are needed to develop predictive models further.

The in situ measurements indicated mean annual air temperature that ranged from -5.2 to -2.3 degrees C at the monitored elevation range of approximate to 3,600-4,150m, and mean annual ground surface temperature that ranged from -1.3 to 1.7 degrees C during 2013-2017. The mean annual ground temperature at 16- to 18-m depth ranged from -1.71 degrees C on the high (>4,000 m above sea level) north facing slope to about 0-C around areas near the lower limit of permafrost. Active layer thickness at the monitored sites varied significantly with the range of 0.77-4.90m during 2011-2017, and maximum frozen depth in seasonally frozen ground was about 5m. Permafrost thickness was between approximate to 136m and less than 10m. Both permafrost and seasonally frozen ground were found to be subject to serious warming during the measured period in the URHR.

Satellite radar altimetry water elevations performance over a 200 m wide river: Evaluation over the Garonne River	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH												For at least 20 years, nadir altimetry satellite missions have been successfully used to first monitor the surface elevation of oceans and, shortly after, of large rivers and lakes. For the last 5-10 years, few studies have demonstrated the possibility to also observe smaller water bodies than previously thought feasible (river smaller than 500 m wide and lake below 10 km(2)). The present study aims at quantifying the nadir altimetry performance over a medium river (200 m or lower wide) with a pluvio-nival regime in a temperate climate (the Garonne River, France). Three altimetry missions have been considered: ENVISAT (from 2002 to 2010), Jason-2 (from 2008 to 2014) and SARAL (from 2013 to 2014). Compared to nearby in situ gages, ENVISAT and Jason-2 observations over the lower Garonne River mainstream (110 km upstream of the estuary) have the smallest errors, with water elevation anomalies root mean square errors (RMSE) around 50 cm and 20 cm, respectively. The few ENVISAT upstream measurements have RMSE ranging from 80 cm to 160 cm. Over the estuary, ENVISAT and SARAL water elevation anomalies RMSE are around 30 cm and 10 cm, respectively. The most recent altimetry mission, SARAL, does not provide river elevation measurements for most satellite overflights of the river mainstream. The altimeter remains "locked" on the top of surrounding hilly areas and does not observe the steep-sided river valley, which could be 50-100 m lower. This phenomenon is also observed, for fewer dates, on Jason-2 and ENVISAT measurements. In these cases, the measurement is not "erroneous", it just does not correspond to water elevation of the river that is covered by the satellite. ENVISAT is less prone to get 'locked' on the top of the topography due to some differences in the instrument measurement parameters, trading lower accuracy for more useful measurements. Such problems are specific to continental surfaces (or near the coasts), but are not observed over the open oceans, which are flatter. To overcome this issue, an experimental instrument operating mode, called the DIODE/DEM tracking mode, has been developed by CNES (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales) and has been tested during few Jason-2 cycles and during the first SARAL/AltiKA cycle. This tracking mode "forces" the instrument to observe a target of interest, i.e. water bodies. The example of the Garonne River shows, for one SARAL ground track, the benefit of the DIODE/DEM tracking mode for a steep-sided river reach, which is not detected using the nominal instrument operating mode. Yet, this mode relies on ancillary datasets (a priori global DEM and global land/water mask), which are critical to obtain river valley observation. The ultimately computed elevations along the satellite tracks, loaded on board, should have an absolute vertical accuracy around 10 m (or better). This case also shows, when the instrument is correctly observing the river valley, that the altimeter can detect water bodies narrower than 100 m (like an artificial canal). In agreement with recent studies, this work shows that altimeter missions can provide useful water elevation measurements over a 200 m wide river with RMSE as low as 50 cm and 20 cm, for ENVISAT and Jason-2 respectively. The seasonal cycle can be observed with the temporal sampling of these missions (35 days and 10 days, respectively), but short term events, like flood events, are most of the time not observed. It also illustrates that altimeter capability to observe a river is highly dependent of the surrounding topography, the observation configuration, previous measurements and the instrument design. Therefore, it is not possible to generalize at global scale the minimum river width that could be seen by altimeters. This study analyzes, for the first time, the potential of the experimental DIODE/DEM tracking mode to observe steep-sided narrow river valleys, which are frequently missed with nominal tracking mode. For such case, using the DIODE/DEM mode could provide water elevation measurements, as long as the on board DEM is accurate enough. This mode should provide many more valid measurements over steep-sided rivers than currently observed. (C) 2016 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

They are known to be ubiquitously present, persistent and bio-accumulative, yet there is a lack of abundance quantifications in freshwater shorelines. Furthermore, there is little understanding of combined effects of seasonality and human population density on the extent of microplastic pollution. In this study, we assessed microplastics in sediment along a subtropical reservoir shoreline across three seasons and seven sites to understand microplastic pollution dynamics along a human population gradient. Multivariable analysis was used to assess relationships among substrate embeddedness, sediment organic matter, human population density and microplastic particle densities and characteristics. Microplastic densities were relatively high during the hot-dry season (mean range 120-6417 particles kg(-1)dwt) whilst the hot-wet season had the lowest densities (mean range 5-94 particles kg(-1)dwt). Microplastic abundances were positively correlated with population density, demonstrating the direct effects of human activity on microplastic contamination. These results highlight the need to further explore microplastic distribution patterns in freshwater ecosystems in the Southern Hemisphere. Furthermore, our findings suggest particular risk for fauna during low rainfall periods through microplastic concentration effects.

Peter			Long-Term and Seasonal Trend Decomposition of Maumee River Nutrient Inputs to Western Lake Erie	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Cyanobacterial blooms in western Lake Erie have recently garnered widespread attention. Current evidence indicates that a major source of the nutrients that fuel these blooms is the Maumee River. We applied a seasonal trend decomposition technique to examine long-term and seasonal changes in Maumee River discharge and nutrient concentrations and loads. Our results indicate similar long-term increases in both regional precipitation and Maumee River discharge (1975-2013), although changes in the seasonal cycles are less pronounced. Total and dissolved phosphorus concentrations declined from the 1970s into the 1990s; since then, total phosphorus concentrations have been relatively stable, while dissolved phosphorus concentrations have increased. However, both total and dissolved phosphorus loads have increased since the 1990s because of the Maumee River discharge increases. Total nitrogen and nitrate concentrations and loads exhibited patterns that were almost the reverse of those of phosphorus, with increases into the 1990s and decreases since then. Seasonal changes in concentrations and loads were also apparent with increases since approximately 1990 in March phosphorus concentrations and loads. These documented changes in phosphorus, nitrogen, and suspended,solids likely reflect changing land-use practices. Knowledge of these patterns should facilitate efforts to better manage ongoing eutrophication problems in western Lake Erie.					; Stow, Craig/AAG-8109-2020; Confesor, Remegio/AAZ-6237-2020	Stow, Craig/0000-0001-6171-7855; Confesor, Remegio/0000-0002-7306-1432; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				MAR 17	2015	49	6					3392	3400		10.1021/es5062648	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es5062648								25679045					WOS:000351324400016

Land use patterns, as one of the main driving forces of water quality change, affect stream water quality differently with the variations in the spatiotemporal scales. Thus, quantitative analysis of the relationship between different land cover types and river water quality contributes to a better understanding of the effects of land cover on water quality, the landscape planning of water quality protection, and integrated water resources management. Based on water quality data of 2006-2018 at 18 typical water quality stations in the Yangtze River basin, this study analyzed the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of water quality by using the single-factor water quality identification index through statistical analysis. Furthermore, the Spearman correlation analysis method was adopted to quantify the spatial-scale and temporal-scale effects of various land uses, including agricultural land (AL), forest land (FL), grassland (GL), water area (WA), and construction land (CL), on the stream water quality of dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (CODMn), and ammonia (NH3-N). The results showed that (1) in terms of temporal variation, the water quality of the river has improved significantly and the tributaries have improved more than the main rivers; (2) in the spatial variation respect, the water quality pollutants in the tributaries are significantly higher than those in the main stream, and the concentration of pollutants increases with the decrease of the distance from the estuary; and (3) the correlation between DO and land use is low, while that between NH3-N, CODMn, and land use is high. CL and AL have a negative effect on water quality, while FL and GL have a purifying effect on water quality. In particular, AL and CL have a significant positive correlation with pollutants in water. Compared with NH3-N, CODMn has a higher correlation with land use at a larger scale. The results highlight the spatial scale and seasonal dependence of land use on water quality, which can provide a scientific basis for land management and seasonal pollution control.

Optical properties of Central Asian aerosol relevant for spaceborne lidar applications and aerosol typing at 355 and 532 nm	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												For the first time, a dense data set of particle extinction-to-backscatter ratios (lidar ratios), linear depolarization ratios, and backscatter- and extinction-related Angstrom exponents for a Central Asian site are presented. The observations were performed with a continuously running multiwavelength polarization Raman lidar at Dushanbe, Tajikistan, during an 18-month campaign (March 2015 to August 2016). The presented seasonally resolved observations fill an important gap in the database of aerosol optical properties used in aerosol typing efforts with spaceborne lidars and ground-based lidar networks. Lidar ratios and depolarization ratios are also basic input parameters in spaceborne lidar data analyses and in efforts to harmonize long-term observations with different space lidar systems operated at either 355 or 532 nm. As a general result, the found optical properties reflect the large range of occurring aerosol mixtures consisting of long-range-transported dust (from the Middle East and the Sahara), regional desert, soil, and salt dust, and anthropogenic pollution. The full range from highly polluted to pure dust situations could be observed. Typical dust depolarization ratios of 0.23-0.29 (355 nm) and 0.300.35 (532 nm) were observed. In contrast, comparably low lidar ratios were found. Dust lidar ratios at 532 nm accumulated around 35-40 sr and were even lower for regional background dust conditions (20-30 sr). Detailed correlation studies (e.g., lidar ratio vs. depolarization ratios, Angstrom exponent vs. lidar ratio and vs. depolarization ratio) are presented to illuminate the complex relationships between the observed optical properties and to identify the contributions of anthropogenic haze, dust, and background aerosol to the overall aerosol mixtures found within the 18-month cam- paign. The observation of 532 nm lidar ratios (< 25 sr) and depolarization ratios (around 15 %-20 %) in layers with very low particle extinction coefficient (< 30 sr) suggests that direct emission and emission of resuspended salt dust (initially originated from numerous desiccating lakes and the Aralkum desert) have a sensitive impact on the aerosol background optical properties over Dushanbe.

J	Wang, JJ; Soininen, J; Heino, J				Wang, Jianjun; Soininen, Janne; Heino, Jani			Ecological indicators for aquatic biodiversity, ecosystem functions, human activities and climate change	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Inland aquatic ecosystems, such as streams, rivers, ponds and lakes, play an important role in maintaining global aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem services. They have been increasingly influenced by environmental change such as global warming, dam construction, habitat fragmentation, eutrophication and urbanization. However, our understanding of the impact of global change on aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem functions remains elusive. The aim of this special issue is to highlight the ecological indicators of aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem functions under global change. The special issue comprises 18 papers including both review and research articles. These papers cover a wide range of research topics, including testing ecological theory, environmental indicator development, biodiversity monitoring and bioassessment. By covering a broad taxonomic range from bacteria and phytoplankton to fish and spanning large spatial (much of Eurasia) and temporal scales (from one season to 25-years observations and 100-years paleo-reconstruction), these articles provide an overview of ecological phenomena from population and community perspectives. Several important implications emerged from these studies: (1) The studies of the long-term succession of biotic community provide important insights into the impacts of human activities and climatic changes on conservation and management of aquatic ecosystems; (2) Anthropogenic activities strongly affect aquatic biodiversity via modifying aquatic habitats and reducing habitat heterogeneity; (3) Biotic assemblages are valuable to for assessing the ecological status of freshwater ecosystems; (4) Aquatic ecosystems have unique characteristics different from other ecosystems, as the underlying drivers and assembly mechanisms of community structure in these ecosystems are highly distinct. Together, the selection of studies reinforces the importance of long-term monitoring, ecological indicator development, and applications of ecological theory in helping us to understand the response of aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem functioning to global change.					; Soininen, Janne/A-4205-2008; Wang, Jianjun/AFK-9641-2022; Heino, Jani/E-6342-2010	Heino, Jani/0000-0003-1235-6613; Soininen, Janne/0000-0002-8583-3137; Wang, Jianjun/0000-0001-7039-7136; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2021	132								108250	10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108250	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108250		NOV 2021											WOS:000719776000002

QNs concentrations were detected in surface water, sediments, and 25 biological samples. The average concentrations of QNs varied from 3.01 ng/L for Oxolinic Acid (OXO) to 174 ng/L for Flumequine (FLU) in water, 3.28 ng/g (dry weight, dw) for OXO to 97.0 ng/g (dw) for FLU in sediments, and from 2.88 ng/g (dw) for Pipemiclic Acid (PIP) to 37.7 ng/g (dw) for FLU in biological samples. The values of bioconcentration factors (BCFs) or bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) (in the range of 98.0-723 L/kg) and biota sediment accumulation factor (BSAFs) (in the range of 0.000300-0.124) were indicated that low bioaccumulation ability of target QNs in biological species. Due to the detected frequencies of FLU, Enrofloxacin (ENR), Norfloxacin (NOR), and Ofloxacin (OFL) were higher than 50%, the trophic magnification factors (TMFs) values for those QNs were calculated from three different habitats. The TMFs for those QNs were ranged from 0.840 to 1.10. Thereinto, ENR and NOR were appeared trophic magnification, while FLU and OFL were appeared trophic dilution in the food web of Baiyangdian Lake. Although the TMFs values of QNs were not showed significantly difference among three habitats, the TMFs values of those QNs showed significantly difference between the foodweb with macrophyte species and without macrophyte species. Except FLU, the other TMFs values of these QNs without macrophyte species (in the range of 0.700-1.01) were lower than the TMFs for QNs with macrophyte species. Finally, the results of human health risk for QNs suggested that consumption of fish from Baiyangdian Lake with a considerable risk, thus more standard and residue limits of QNs should be set to decrease the human health risk around this region.

Eutrophication of lakes cannot be controlled by reducing nitrogen input: Results of a 37-year whole-ecosystem experiment	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Lake 227, a small lake in the Precambrian Shield at the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA), has been fertilized for 37 years with constant annual inputs of phosphorus and decreasing inputs of nitrogen to test the theory that controlling nitrogen inputs can control eutrophication. For the final 16 years (1990-2005), the lake was fertilized with phosphorus alone. Reducing nitrogen inputs increasingly favored nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria as a response by the phytoplankton community to extreme seasonal nitrogen limitation. Nitrogen fixation was sufficient to allow biomass to continue to be produced in proportion to phosphorus, and the lake remained highly eutrophic, despite showing indications of extreme nitrogen limitation seasonally. To reduce eutrophication, the focus of management must be on decreasing inputs of phosphorus.

Little is known about phosphonate metabolism in freshwater ecosystems, although rapid consumption of phosphonates has been observed frequently. Cyanobacteria are often the dominant primary producers in freshwaters; yet, only a few strains of cyanobacteria encode phosphonate-degrading (C-P lyase) gene clusters. The phycosphere is defined as the microenvironment in which extensive phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria interactions occur. It has been demonstrated that phytoplankton may recruit phycospheric bacteria based on their own needs. Therefore, the establishment of a phycospheric community rich in phosphonate-degrading-bacteria likely facilitates cyanobacterial proliferation, especially in waters with scarce phosphorus. We characterized the distribution of heterotrophic phosphonate-degrading bacteria in field Microcystis bloom samples and in laboratory cyanobacteria "phycospheres" by qPCR and metagenomic analyses. The role of phosphonate-degrading phycospheric bacteria in cyanobacterial proliferation was determined through coculturing of heterotrophic bacteria with an axenic Microcystis aeruginosa strain and by metatranscriptomic analysis using field Microcystis aggregate samples. esults Abundant bacteria that carry C-P lyase clusters were identified in plankton samples from freshwater Lakes Dianchi and Taihu during Microcystis bloom periods. Metagenomic analysis of 162 non-axenic laboratory strains of cyanobacteria (consortia cultures containing heterotrophic bacteria) showed that 20% (128/647) of high-quality bins from eighty of these consortia encode intact C-P lyase clusters, with an abundance ranging up to nearly 13%. Phycospheric bacterial phosphonate catabolism genes were expressed continually across bloom seasons, as demonstrated through metatranscriptomic analysis using sixteen field Microcystis aggregate samples. Coculturing experiments revealed that although Microcystis cultures did not catabolize methylphosphonate when axenic, they demonstrated sustained growth when cocultured with phosphonate-utilizing phycospheric bacteria in medium containing methylphosphonate as the sole source of phosphorus. Conclusions The recruitment of heterotrophic phosphonate-degrading phycospheric bacteria by cyanobacteria is a hedge against phosphorus scarcity by facilitating phosphonate availability. Cyanobacterial consortia are likely primary contributors to aquatic phosphonate mineralization, thereby facilitating sustained cyanobacterial growth, and even bloom maintenance, in phosphate-deficient waters.

J	Feng, L; Han, XX; Hu, CM; Chen, XL				Feng, Lian; Han, Xingxing; Hu, Chuanmin; Chen, Xiaoling			Four decades of wetland changes of the largest freshwater lake in China: Possible linkage to the Three Gorges Dam?	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Wetlands provide important ecosystem functions for water alteration and conservation of bio-diversity, yet they are vulnerable to both human activities and climate changes. Using four decades of Landsat and HJ-1A/1B satellites observations and recently developed classification algorithms, long-term wetland changes in Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake of China, have been investigated in this study. In dry seasons, while the transitions from mudflat to vegetation and vice versa were comparable before 2001, vegetation area increased by 620.8 km(2) (16.6% of the lake area) between 2001 and 2013. In wet seasons, although no obvious land cover changes were observed between 1977 and 2003, similar to 30% of the Nanjishan Wetland National Nature Reserve (NWNNR) in the south lake changed from water to emerged plant during 2003 and 2014. The changing rate of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in dry seasons showed that the vegetation in the lake center regions flourished, while the growth of vegetation in the off-water areas was stressed. Rapid NDVI increase was also found in the NWNNR in the wet seasons. The relationships between the water levels and vegetation coverage also showed two regimes in both dry and wet seasons for the pre-Three Gorges Dam (TGD) period (before 2003) and post-TGD period (after 2003). Analyses of long-term hydrological and meteorological data clearly indicated that while local precipitation remained stable, the water level of Poyang Lake decreased significantly after the impoundment of the TGD, which is likely the main reason for the wetland expansion in recent years.

J	Drenkhan, F; Huggel, C; Guardamino, L; Haeberli, W				Drenkhan, Fabian; Huggel, Christian; Guardamino, Lucia; Haeberli, Wilfried			Managing risks and future options from new lakes in the deglaciating Andes of Peru: The example of the Vilcanota-Urubamba basin	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Rapidly growing lakes in deglaciating mountain regions represent both: emerging risks and options for human livelihoods. In the Andes of Peru, seasonal water scarcity and Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOF) pose a serious threat for highly exposed and vulnerable people. In addition, water demand is growing due to increasing irrigated agriculture, population and hydropower production. In this context, we assess current and future water risks and management options for the Vilcanota-Urubamba basin, Southern Peru. Therefore, the GLOF susceptibility of glacier lakes and the potential maximum reach of damaging flow were analysed. Eighteen out of 134 current and another six out of 20 future glacier lakes were identified as potentially highly susceptible to GLOF. A total of eight existing and one possible future lakes indicate very high risk potentials. Furthermore, a comprehensive surface water balance scheme for five selected subcatchments reveals that future river discharge could be reduced by some 2-11% (7-14%) until 2050 (2100). Particularly in headwaters and during dry seasons, glacier contribution representing roughly 15-25% to total streamflow is crucial and would substantially decrease to below 4-22% (1-3%) until 2050 (2100) with strong glacier shrinkage under intense warming (scenario RCP8.5). In the middle and lower basin, long-term water availability could be jeopardized by growing irrigated agriculture and hydropower capacity. Combining a GLOF and water shortage risk assessment, three key hotspots of current and future water risks were identified. In the context of the identified risks and complex intertwining of water users involving conflict potentials, robust adaptation planning is necessary within an integrative water and risk management framework. Therefore, it is crucial to incorporate ancestral and local knowledge for long-term management planning and implementation.

Owing to their insufficient ability to distinguish between multiple sources, common sediment source apportionment methods would rarely be a practical solution. On the basis of the inseparable relationships between sediment and adsorbed microorganisms, community-based microbial source tracking may be a novel method of identifying dominant sediment sources in the era of high-throughput sequencing. Dongting Lake was selected as a study area as it receives considerable sediment import from its inflowing rivers during the flood season. This study was conducted to characterize the bacterial community composition of sediment samples from the inflow-river estuaries and quantify their sediment microbe contributions to the central lake. Metagenomic analysis revealed that the community compositions of source sediment samples were significantly different, allowing specific sources to be identified with the machine learning classification program SourceTracker. A modified analysis using SourceTracker found that the major contributors to three major lake districts were the Songzi, Zishui, and Xinqiang Rivers. The impacts of hydrodynamic conditions on source apportionment were further verified and suggested the practicability of this method to offer a systematic and comprehensive understanding of sediment sources, pathways, and transport dynamics. Finally, a novel framework for sediment source-tracking was established to develop effective sediment management and control strategies in river lake systems.					; LI, ZHONGWU/JJC-8813-2023; Wang, Longfei/K-8176-2018; wang, pei/MTG-1182-2025; Wang, Chao/GXF-8353-2022; Gao, Yu/HDO-8357-2022	Gao, Yu/0000-0003-4406-2978; Wang, Longfei/0000-0003-2811-2656; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				APR 16	2019	53	8					4099	4108		10.1021/acs.est.8b07334	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b07334								30864784					WOS:000465190300010

We investigated 398 samples of the phytoplankton phosphorus resource use efficiency (RUEP = chlorophyll-a concentration/dissolved phosphate) across two seasons in nine plateau lakes in Yunnan Province, China. We identified the main contributors to phytoplankton RUEP and analyzed their potential influences on RUEP at different lake trophic states. The results showed that total nitrogen (TN) contributed the most to RUEP among the nine lakes, whereas community turnover (measured as community dissimilarity) explained the most to RUEP variation across the two seasons. Moreover, TN also influenced RUEP by affecting biodiversity. Species richness (SR), functional attribute diversity (FAD2), and dendrogram-based functional diversity (FDc) were positively correlated with RUEP in both seasons, while evenness was negatively correlated with RUEP at the end of the rainy season. We also found that the effects of biodiversity and turnover on RUEP depended on the lake trophic states. SR and FAD2 were positively correlated with RUEP in all three trophic states. Evenness showed a negative correlation with RUEP at the eutrophic and oligotrophic levels, but a positive correlation at the mesotrophic level. Turnover had a negative influence on RUEP at the eutrophic level, but a positive influence at the mesotrophic and oligotrophic levels. Overall, our results suggested that multiple factors and nutrient states need to be considered when the ecosystem functioning predictors and the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships are investigated.

J	Kuhn, C; Butman, D				Kuhn, Catherine; Butman, David			Declining greenness in Arctic-boreal lakes	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The highest concentration of the world's lakes are found in Arcticboreal regions [C. Verpoorter, T. Kutser, D. A. Seekell, L. J. Tranvik, Geophys. Res. Lett. 41, 6396-6402 (2014)], and consequently are undergoing the most rapid warming [J. E. Overland et al., Arctic Report Card (2018)]. However, the ecological response of Arcticboreal lakes to warming remains highly uncertain. Historical trends in lake color from remote sensing observations can provide insights into changing lake ecology, yet have not been examined at the panArctic scale. Here, we analyze time series of 30-m Landsat growing season composites to quantify trends in lake greenness for >4 x 10(5) waterbodies in boreal and Arctic western North America. We find lake greenness declined overall by 15% from the first to the last decade of analysis within the 6.3 x 10(6)-km(2) study region but with significant spatial variability. Greening declines were more likely to be found in areas also undergoing increases in air temperature and precipitation. These findings support the hypothesis that warming has increased connectivity between lakes and the land surface [A. Bring et al., J. Geophys. Res. Biogeosciences 121, 621-649 (2016)], with implications for lake carbon cycling and energy budgets. Our study provides spatially explicit information linking climate to panArctic lake color changes, a finding that will help target future ecological monitoring in remote yet rapidly changing regions.

Yet specific ecological features of individual phylogenetic groups and interactions among these are largely unknown. We used 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes to study associations of different bacterioplankton groups to environmental characteristics and their co-occurrence patterns over an annual cycle in a dimictic lake. Clear seasonal succession of the bacterioplankton community was observed. After binning of sequences into previously described and highly resolved phylogenetic groups (tribes), their temporal dynamics revealed extensive synchrony and associations with seasonal events such as ice coverage, ice-off, mixing and phytoplankton blooms. Coupling between closely and distantly related tribes was resolved by time-dependent rank correlations, suggesting ecological coherence that was often dependent on taxonomic relatedness. Association networks with the abundant freshwater Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria in focus revealed complex interdependencies within bacterioplankton communities and contrasting linkages to environmental conditions. Accordingly, unique ecological features can be inferred for each tribe and reveal the natural history of abundant cultured and uncultured freshwater bacteria.

Thus, in this study, we investigated landscape metrics that affect the water quality of the rivers flowing into Dongjiang Lake, China, and their spatial and seasonal differences, were investigated using redundancy and partial redundancy analyses. Further, a raw water quality parameterlandscape metric data set was constructed. Threshold values of landscape metrics that induced sudden changes in water quality were analyzed using the bootstrap method applied to 1000 random samples extracted from data set. Finally, mechanisms of landscape patterns that affected river water quality were quantitively explored. The following results were obtained: (1) The key area of landscape that impacted water quality in the Dongjiang Lake Basin was the 400 m buffer zone; (2) Seasonal differences were observed in water quality changes, which better explained by landscape metrics in the dry season than in the wet season. Moreover, water quality was most influenced by landscape configuration metrics. The influence of landscape topographic metrics was greater than that of composition metrics in the dry season, whereas the opposite was true in the wet season; and (3) In this watershed, the largest patch index of grassland and landscape shape index of built-up land were the key metrics at the sub-basin and 400 m buffer zone, respectively. If the largest patch index of grassland was below 8.5% or the landscape shape index of built-up land exceeded 1.5, the water quality of the rivers flowing into the lake was prone to a risk of significant decline, which has an important guiding significance to the optimization of land use pattern.

Several efforts have been paid to reduce negative effects of nutrient accumulation. However, little is known about the internal cycling process of N and P in traditional aquaculture ponds. In this study, we determined the kinetic parameters of critical extracellular enzymes (including alkaline phosphatase (AP) and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP)) involved in N and P cycling and variations of trophic states in three kinds of ponds with typical cultured species (fish, crab, and crayfish) around Lake Honghu in four months of different seasons from 2019 to 2020. Additionally, sediment P release potential was assessed meanwhile. Results indicated that trophic state in the ponds was cultural species specific. In fish ponds, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) was the major component of the total phosphorus (TP). Accumulation of P and imbalance of N and P ratio occurred due to exogenous inputs. Meanwhile, the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite were also the highest in the fish ponds, reaching 4.14 mg L-1 and 0.29 mg L-1 respectively. Enzymatic kinetic parameters were used to assess trophic state and regeneration rate of N and P in the ponds. The turnover time of organic P mediated by AP (T-AP) and its Michaelis constant (K-m) were found to be significantly positively correlated to SRP concentrations (P < 0.05) and negatively related to N and P ratios (P < 0.05). With increasing TP concentrations, the maximum velocity (V-max) of LAP increased linearly (P < 0.05), accelerating the efficiency of N regeneration. These results suggested excessive P limited the hydrolysis of organic P but promoted the production of harmful NH4+-N from organic N, implying that extracellular enzyme balanced regenerations of N and P in the ponds. Analysis of sediment suggested that there existed higher risks of benthic P release in fish ponds, while the equilibrium P concentrations (EPC0) were significantly positively related to proportion of Fe (OOH) similar to P, contents of TP and organic carbon (OC) (P < 0.05). Even so, the sediment tended to adsorb phosphate rather than release P in most farming months. Overall, harmful ammonium and nitrite accumulated massively in fish ponds due to high P loads, while massive P might derive from exogenous inputs or endogenous sources such as sediment. This study uncovered the coupling interactions between N and P cycles in traditional aquaculture ponds, implicating that a balanced N and P management measures were recommended in aquaculture ponds during farming period.

The demographic explosion that marked the 20th century on the one hand caused constant growth of the need for pure water and on the other hand increased the extent of water pollution due to development of industry, intensification of agriculture and expansion of urban regions. Human action leads to greater or lesser changes of ecological factors in aquatic ecosystems (amount of dissolved oxygen, pH, heavy metal concentration, etc.), regulation of watercourses, disruption of communication between biocoenoses and disturbance of the natural water regime (through the creation of reservoirs). All of this brings about changes in biocoenoses that can be very pronounced, going even so far as to the virtual destruction of life in an aquatic ecosystem or in less severe cases to replacement of an existing biocoenosis by a new one that due to greater homogeneity of ecological factors is characterized by lower diversity. In order to conserve the water resources of the Republic of Serbia, it is necessary to monitor them closely. Biomonitoring is an obligatory part of this task because it is a simple, fast and economical way to follow the state of ecosystems of land-based water. Of all groups of aquatic organisms used in biomonitoring: bacteria, protozoans, zooplankton, phytobenthos, macrophytes and fish, macroinvertebrates are the most widely employed, especially in streams, where they are absolutely the most significant community of bioindicatory organisms. Modern biomonitoring of streams both in the world at large and in Serbia is based to the greatest extent on the use of macroinvertebrates as bioindicators of water quality owing to their many advantages over other aquatic organisms. Macroinvertebrates are widely disseminated organisms that inhabit various types of aquatic ecosystems, from little temporary (ephemeral) stagnant pools, small springs and creeks to large lakes and rivers. The great diversity of macrozoobenthic organisms and extremely complex structure of their communities on the one hand make them very sensitive to anthropogenic action causing changes of ecological factors, and on the other hand enable them potentially to respond with changes in the composition of their biocoenoses that are proportional to intensity of the anthropogenic action in question. Such organisms are characterized by the ability to persist in conditions of fast flowing water because they live attached to the bottom, possess long life cycles and have limited mobility. Their low mobility and sedentary way of life enable the investigator to establish the state of ecological factors on a given area. The relatively long life cycles (lasting 2-3 years) of these organisms make it possible to investigate changes occurring over the course of time. Apart from biological considerations, there are also numerous practical reasons why these organisms are considered good indicators of water quality: samples are taken with relatively inexpensive equipment; the taxonomy of most groups has been thoroughly elaborated; keys for their identification are available; methods that employ macrozoobenthic organisms have been used for many years and are highly reliable; and the responses of certain organisms to different types and levels of pollution have been precisely defined. Macrozoobenthic organisms can be used to test the influence of anthropogenic stress on aquatic. biotopes at all levels of biological organization, from molecular to ecosystematic. The effects of pollution on these organisms under natural conditions are most often analysed on the level of their populations or communities, using structural attributes (measured by indexes of diversity and similarity, biotic indexes, etc.) or functional characteristics, including, for example, primary production, respiratory processes, biomass (secondary production) and circulation of elements, but also aspects of the organisms' life history such as functional guilds in the feeding of a taxon. Investigation of macrozoobenthic communities has been and will be a central part of the ecology of land-based water, partly due to the fact that streams for them represent a crucial link between resources in the form of organic matter (for example, fallen leaves, algae, detritus, etc.) and fish in food webs, and partly due to the diversity and wide dissemination of the organisms involved. In view of these facts, it is unsurprising that systematic research on the fauna of macroinvertebrates in land-based water of Serbia was initiated almost a century ago and has been carried out in continuity with varying intensity up to the present day. More intensive use of macroinvertebrates in biomonitoring of the ecosystems of land-based water in Serbia, as in the world at large, began around the middle of the last century, at which time they started to be included in monitoring of water quality by the Hydrometeorological Institute of Serbia. As can be seen from the above, Serbian science actively followed world trends in biomonitoring of land-based water from the very start, although the intensity of these investigations was highly variable. Intensification of research on macroinvertebrates and their use in biomonitoring of land-based water occurred during the 1990s, with the formation in Novi Sad, Belgrade and Kragujevac of several independent teams of investigators that laid a solid foundation for further progress, as is evident in a series of studies introducing new and modern methods of biomonitoring, methods such as employment of biomarkers, recording of morphological asymmetries and deformities and use of artificial neuron networks. To be specific, the work of these teams has greatly advanced available knowledge about biology of the macroinvertebrates of land-based water in Serbia and continued to keep pace with world trends in their use for biomonitoring. A good example is the development of BNBI and incorporation of a number of EU standard methods into norms for regulation of biomonitoring in Serbia. Despite this positive trend, it must be stated that the use of macroinvertebrates as bioindicators of the quality of land-based water in Serbia is relatively limited because in the majority of cases it is done within the framework of saprobiological analyses, whereas biotic indexes are for the most part unjustifiably ignored, while multimetric indexes and the multivariant approach have not even begun to be employed. For these reasons, the state of biomomitoring in Serbia still cannot be considered satisfactory. To be specific, if the extent of land-based water biomonitoring in Great Britain where it is continuously conducted at more than 6000 localities is compared with the state of affairs in Serbia where about 90 localities out of a planned 500 are continuously monitored it can be seen that the level of biomonitoring in our country is disproportionally lower. Moreover, a comparison of stream quality in Great Britain, despite that country's significantly more advanced industrial development and greater population density, with the situation in Serbia shows that the quality of streams in our country is conspicuously far worse. It is clearly necessary to expand the volume and content of biomonitoring because only in that way will it be possible to make correct decisions in the management of water resources and thereby improve their quality. Meanwhile, at the existing level of macroinvertebrate studies in Serbia, that is not simply a question of political willingness, but also a task limited by the quality and quantity of fundamental research. As has been stated before, successful use of macroinvertebrates in biomonitoring demands an exceptionally good knowledge of the base reference state. That at the present time calls for additional faunistic, taxonomic, biogeographic and toxicological research, as well as studies on the typization of watercourses. It will be possible to define groups of reference localities in Serbia, as has been done in Great Britain, only if the inventory of species in our country is known in detail, if taxonomic problems are resolved, if keys for the identification of species are available, if their range has been clarified and if the types of watercourses and their ecological status (condition) are known. This in turn will make it possible to apply some highly organized system of biomonitoring like RIVPACS or to develop a multimetric index like the ones elaborated in the EU's AQEM program. That the path to this goal is long is clearly indicated by the fact although acknowledged experts today exist for the taxonomy of macroinvertebrate groups such as Chironomidae, Oligochaeta, Heteroptera, Trichoptera, Amphipoda and Gastropoda, research on a number of very important groups such as Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera has only just begun, a situation that has a significant effect on the quality and reliability of determination of these groups, knowledge about their distribution and awareness of their ecological preferences, as well as on the typization of land-based water habitats in Serbia vis-a-vis other countries in the world. Progress in this area largely depends on politics of the state, that is on the measure in which it is ready to support studies, finance the necessary increase in the number of researchers and through selection of programs and projects guide investigative efforts in an appropriate direction. It is also necessary to widen the network of localities at which sampling is prescribed by law, since only by sampling in an organized and planned manner will it be possible to collect an adequate number of data in a procedurally uniform way permitting the drawing of comparisons, development of new biomononitoring methods in Serbia and improvement of ones already in existence. That is the only way to form a standardized database of information about the ecosystems of Serbian streams. Such a database will be the foundation needed for the standardization of reference localities, which represents a key step toward the implementation of both multivariant and multimetric methods in biomonitoring.																			1452-7375		978-86-7025-777-1				2018	171						199	229																WOS:000485068200007
J	Kim, HG; Hong, S; Chon, TS; Joo, GJ				Kim, Hyo Gyeom; Hong, Sungwon; Chon, Tae-Soo; Joo, Gea-Jae			Spatial patterning of chlorophyll a and water-quality measurements for determining environmental thresholds for local eutrophication in the Nakdong River basin	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Management of water-quality in a river ecosystem needs to be focused on susceptible regions to eutrophication based on proper measurements. The stress response relationships between nutrients and primary productivity of phytoplankton allow the derivation of ecologically acceptable thresholds of stressors under field conditions. However, spatio-temporal variations in heterogeneous environmental conditions have hindered the development of locally applicable criteria. To address these issues, we utilized a combination of a geographically specialized artificial neural network (Geo-SOM, geo-self-organizing map) and linear mixed-effect models (LMMs). The model was applied to a 24-month dataset of 54 stations that spanned a wide spatial gradient in the Nakdong River basin. The Geo-SOM classified 1286 observations in the basin into 13 clusters that were regionally and seasonally distinct. Inclusion of the random effects of Geo-SOM clustering improved the performance of each LMM, which suggests that there were significant spatio-temporal variations in the Chla-stressor relationships. These variations arise owing to differences in background seasonality and the effects of local pollutant variables and land-use patterns. Among the 16 environmental variables, the major stressors for Chla were total phosphate (TP) as a nutrient and biological oxygen demand (BOD) as a non-nutrient according to the results of both Geo-SOM and LMM analyses. Based on LMMs with the random effect of the Geo-SOM clusters on the intercept and the slope, we can propose recommended thresholds for TP (18.5 mu g L-1) and BOD (1.6 mg L-1) in the Nakdong River. The combined method of LMM and Geo-SOM will be useful in guiding appropriate local water-quality-management strategies and in the global development of large-scale nutrient criteria.

Evaluating detection of temporal trends in long-term freshwater fisheries data to inform future monitoring efforts	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Objective Florida's Freshwater Fisheries Long-Term Monitoring Program was implemented in 2006 to track changes in freshwater fish populations and communities. As part of an evaluation of the program, this study used a simulation framework to assess trend detection for fish abundance and biomass indices and how sampling intensity (number of samples per year) and frequency (number of years) can influence detection of these trends.Methods Using count and weight data from fall electrofishing samples collected between 2006 and 2021 from 21 lakes, trends were simulated for annual mean count and weight over a 10-year period that ranged from -70% to +200%. In all, simulations were performed for seven game fish species and three management-relevant groups (large nongame, nonnative, and prey species). For sampling intensity, data were simulated with a range of sample sizes, from 10 to 40 electrofishing transects or the maximum number available for a given lake. For sampling frequency, data were simulated for different sampling schedules that included sampling 1 year followed by 1- or 2-year breaks (4-5 years of sampling in a 10-year period), sampling two consecutive years followed by 1- or 2-year breaks (6-7 years of sampling in a 10-year period), and sampling the first 5 years only.Results Simulations based on weight and count data yielded similar results, but the effect of sampling frequency and sampling schedule varied by species, management group, and lake. Trend detection was lower and more variable when mean counts and weights of fish in electrofishing samples were low. Overall, at least a 60% increase or 40% decrease over a 10-year period was typically needed for trends in mean weight and count to be detected at least 80% of the time in at least half of the lakes. Increasing sampling intensity did not substantially improve trend detection for lower-magnitude changes, but reducing sample intensity to a minimum of 10 electrofishing transects per year would have a large negative effect on trend detection in almost all lakes. Detection of trends improved as the number of years sampled increased, but ideally, sampling should be spaced throughout the entire 10-year period to capture the full magnitude of change. Sampling every year generally resulted in better trend detection and for many species and groups was the only sampling schedule that resulted in all study lakes achieving the 80% target detection level. Of the alternative schedules considered, those involving 2 years of consecutive sampling outperformed those with only 1 year of sampling followed by a 1- or 2-year break.Conclusions Relatively large changes in mean count and weight were required to detect trends over a 10-year period, but there was no clear advantage of using count or weight data for monitoring purposes. Further, study results support the current sampling intensity, but trend detection is optimized at higher mean catch and weight values. Although sampling every year is ideal, an alternative schedule involving sampling two consecutive years with 1- or 2-year breaks could be considered in certain situations. These results will be important for informing future decisions regarding Florida's Freshwater Fisheries Long-Term Monitoring Program and other monitoring initiatives. The ability to detect changes in the count and weight of select fish species and management groups over a 10-year period varied across a range of sampling scenarios. Simulation-based evaluations like this study are critical for improving long-term fisheries monitoring programs and ensuring their long-term success.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				2025 SEP 26	2025										10.1093/najfmt/vqaf089	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/najfmt/vqaf089		SEP 2025											WOS:001579788100001

Regular areal estimates of green tide surfaces are publicly available but only from 2002 onwards. Using free and openly accessible Landsat satellite imagery archives over 35 years (1984-2019), this study explores the potential of remote sensing for detection and long-term monitoring of green macroalgae blooms. By using a Google Earth Engine (GEE) script, we were able to detect and quantify green tide surfaces using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) at four highly affected beaches in Northern Brittany. Mean green tide coverage was derived and analyzed from 1984 to 2019, at both monthly and annual scales. Our results show important interannual and seasonal fluctuations in estimated macroalgae cover. In terms of trends over time, green tide events did not show a decrease in extent at three out of four studied sites. The observed decrease in nitrogen concentrations for the rivers draining the study sites has not resulted in a reduction of green tide extents.					; van Emmerik, Tim/L-2817-2014	Le Lay, Yves-Francois/0000-0002-7085-6563; Schreyers, Louise/0000-0002-2607-1494; van Emmerik, Tim/0000-0002-4773-9107														2072-4292				APR	2021	13	8							1408	10.3390/rs13081408	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13081408													WOS:000644677100001

J.; Shen, Sichen; Yi, Yi; Yi, Peng; Yu, Zhongbo			Using stable isotopes paired with tritium analysis to assess thermokarst lake water balances in the Source Area of the Yellow River, northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A spatially distributed network of thermokarst lakes undergoing significant environmental changes was sampled in 2014 and 2016 to develop a comprehensive understanding of lake water balances in lakes across a gradient of frozen ground conditions. Frozen ground ranges from seasonally frozen ground (SFG) to sporadic discontinuous permafrost (SDP) to extensive discontinuous permafrost (EDP), and is representative of complex conditions in the Source Area of the Yellow River, northeastern part of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Radioactive and stable water isotopes in reference lakes (non-thaw lakes), thermokarst lakes, precipitation, wetlands, ground ice and supra permafrost groundwater are analyzed to characterize systematic variations and to assess lake water balances using stable isotope mass balance (IMB). IMB, paired with analysis of tritium decay gradients, is shown to be a valid approach for detecting short-term shifts in lake water balance, which allows evaluation of the proportion of precipitation-derived versus permafrost-derived water inputs to lakes. All lakes except EDP thaw lakes are evaporation-dominated (E/I > 0.5). Negative water balances occurred most frequently in reference lakes due to hydrological connectivity with rivers. Precipitation-derived water inputs result in positive water balances in SFG and SDP thermokarst lakes, but negative-trending water balances arc found in SDP thermokarst lakes clue to substantial reduction in water yield Increasing contributions from thawing permafrost in EDP thermokarst lakes result in strong positive water balance. Permafrost degradation may also lead to the changes in hydrological connectivity between precipitation and wetlands or thermokarst lakes. Based on these findings, a conceptual model of the hydrological evolution of thermokarst lakes under the influence of permafrost degradation is proposed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Urban blue-green spaces can regulate the microclimate of the surroundings through providing shade and transpiration while saving the energy use of residents. Under changing climate conditions, accurately assessing urban blue-green spaces' cooling and carbon-saving capacities is a prerequisite for the smart growth of the city. However, little attention has been paid to the cooling and carbon-saving potential of different blue-green spaces in mid and high latitude regions. Based on this, we selected Tianjin, a typical high-density city in northern China, as the study area and quantified the cooling intensity, cooling distance, and carbon-saving by cooling of the green space, the rivergreen space, and the lake-green space's samples under different seasons. The results show that: (1) the average background temperature can significantly affect the cooling and carbon-saving capacities of blue-green spaces and the intensity of the influencing factors on them. (2) Among the three types of urban blue-green space, the river-green space has the highest overall cooling and carbon-saving potential. The carbon-saving of the green space is better than the lake-green space but the cooling intensity of the green space is weaker. (3) The improved method of calculating "threshold value of efficiency" is more able to match the location of the inflexion points, and it can help planners obtain more accurate optimal blue-green space patch sizes. The contribution of this study is mainly in revealing the thermal sensitivity of the existence of cooling and carbon-saving functions under different background temperatures. The results of this study will serve as a tool for urban planners to configure the appropriate size and type of UBGS for different scenarios to achieve efficient cooling and carbon-saving in high-density by the urban blue-green space, which are in urgent need of smart growth strategies.

J	Zhang, LQ; Xu, YJ; Li, SY				Zhang, Liuqing; Xu, Y. Jun; Li, Siyue			Source and quality of dissolved organic matter in streams are reflective to land use/land cover, climate seasonality and pCO2	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Sources and quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in streams may be largely controlled by the landscape and season. In this study, we attempted to answer three critical questions: 1) Do land use/land cover (LULC) types affect DOM characteristics? 2) Is there a seasonal fluctuation in DOM components? 3) How do DOM quality and LULC types influence aqueous carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2). To achieve this, we investigated the fluorescence characteristics of DOM and its implication for pCO2 in three streams draining land with different urban intensities under distinctive dry and wet seasons. Four fluorescence components were identified, including two terrestrial humic-like components, one protein-like component and one microbial humic-like component. We found a significant positive relationship of the maximum fluorescence intensity (Fmax) of the four components and fluorescence index (FI370) with urbanization intensity in both the dry and wet seasons. The mean Fmax, biological index (BIX) and FI370 all exhibited an increasing trend from upstream to downstream in the stream with highest proportions of urban and cropland. The fluorescence characteristics were negatively related to proportion of forested land in the both seasons. The terrestrial humic-like DOM was dominating in the studied streams. Moreover, the seasonality altered the DOM composition, with protein-like component emerging only in stream waters during the dry season, while microbial humic-like component exclusively occurred during the wet season. pCO2 values were positively related to terrestrial humic-like and biological protein-like components, and urban land. The dry season had much higher pCO2 than the wet season. Results from the Partial Least Squares Path (PLS-PM) models further indicated that LULC types were important in mediating fluorescence DOM whilst pCO2 was more sensitive to the direct effect from FDOM dynamics. We conclude that DOM source and quality in streams are reflective to LULC and climate seasonality, and are good indicators of pCO2 via source tracer and quality of fluorescence components.					Xu, Y.

SPM has preferable adsorption ability for antibiotics in water; therefore, SPM adsorption and coagulation may be a possible way to remove tetracycline (TC) from water. This study carried out coagulation experiments combining SPM collected from a natural lake at a location with three common coagulants-dpolyaluminum sulfate, polyaluminum chloride, and polyferric sulfate-dunder different pH values, exploring the adsorption of TC by SPM, coagulation of SPM with TC, and the primary influencing factors of this process. The maximum removal rate of TC can reach 97.87% with an SPM concentration of 1000 mg/L. Multi-factor analysis of variance showed the importance of various TC removal factors, which were ranked as follows: SPM concentration[ initial TC concentration > type of coagulant > pH values. The higher the SPM concentration, the better the TC removal (p < 0.001). Fourier infrared spectroscopy results demonstrated the strong adsorption effect of SPM on TC after being combined with a coagulant, and scanning electron microscopy also indicated that SPM becomes effective nuclei in the coagulation process, which is a possible reason for better TC removal. However, the effluent turbidities under 1000 mg/L SPM concentrations were high without coagulant aid. With the addition of coagulant aid anion polyacrylamide, the TC removal remained unchanged, effluent turbidity significantly reduced, and the TC desorption became low. These results indicate that applying SPM from natural lakes in the coagulation process could potentially remove TC in water. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

While this technology could potentially make an important contribution to the energy transition, the current uncertainty about the water quality effects of FPV deployment poses a major barrier to FPV project development and implementation. In this study, we investigated the water quality effects of three distinctive FPV system designs, implemented as part of a 1-year pilot project at the Oostvoornse lake, the Netherlands. A water quality monitoring campaign was set up to monitor on a continuous basis a set of key water quality parameters, including light intensity, water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration. The measurements were conducted below each of the three FPV systems and contrasted with reference measurements at open water adjacent to the systems. Our monitoring results show that of the water quality parameters considered, the impact of the FPV systems on light intensity was found to be most pronounced, with a light reduction between 73% and 100% relative to the reference measurements. We found limited evidence to corroborate that the FPV systems induced changes to the water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration. However, it must be noted that this study took place under highly specific conditions due the limited size of the FPV pilot systems and the brackish water of the Oostvoornse lake. This means that the water quality effects reported here may not be representative for a larger scale application of the FPV designs, and may not be one-on-one transferable to other, non-brackish project locations elsewhere.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

J	Ghannam, HE				Ghannam, Hala E.			Risk assessment of pollution with heavy metals in water and fish from River Nile, Egypt	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The aim of this study is to investigate the level of contamination with metals (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and Pb) in the Nile River at the great Cairo region. Samples of water and fish were collected seasonally from different sites along the investigated area. Physical and chemical parameters of the studied water samples such as temperature, transparency, electrical conductivity, pH, BOD, and COD were measured. In aquatic ecosystems, heavy metal concentrations are monitored by detecting some indices like water pollution indices (WPI) and bioaccumulation factor (BAF). The results clarified that Fe, Pb, and Mn concentrations in water exceed the allowed limits set by WHO, 2011 in all sites while Cu and Zn are in allowed limits. While in fish muscle Fe and Cu are within the permissible limits set by FAO, 1992, but Mn, Zn and Pb exceed the limits. Some of the metals like Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni and Zn are essential for animals and plants while many other like Pb, Cd, Cr and Co are classed as nonessential metals. All values of HI were below 1 except for Pb in case of habitual fish eaters that give alarm to fish consumer.

Here we show that gradual environmental changes induced by, for example, eutrophication or global warming can induce major oxic-anoxic regime shifts. We first investigate a mathematical model describing interactions between microbial communities and biogeochemical oxidation-reduction reactions. In response to gradual changes in oxygen influx, this model abruptly transitions between an oxic state dominated by cyanobacteria and an anoxic state with sulfate-reducing bacteria and phototrophic sulfur bacteria. The model predictions are consistent with observations from a seasonally stratified lake, which shows hysteresis in the transition between oxic and anoxic states with similar changes in microbial community composition. Our results suggest that hysteresis loops and tipping points are a common feature of oxic-anoxic transitions, causing rapid drops in oxygen levels that are not easily reversed, at scales ranging from small ponds to global oceanic anoxic events.

Human health risk from consumption of aquatic species in arsenic-contaminated shallow urban lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Arsenic (As) causes cancer and non-cancer health effects in humans. Previous research revealed As concentrations over 200 mu g g(-1) in lake sediments in the south-central Puget Sound region affected by the former ASARCO copper smelter in Ruston, WA, and significant bioaccumulation of As in plankton in shallow lakes. Enhanced uptake occurs during summertime stratification and near-bottom anoxia when As is mobilized from sediments. Periodic mixing events in shallow lakes allow dissolved As to mix into oxygenated waters and littoral zones where biota reside. We quantify As concentrations and associated health risks in human-consumed tissues of sunfish [pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus)], crayfish [signal (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and red swamp (Procambarus clarkii)], and snails [Chinese mystery (Bellamya chinensis)] from lakes representing a gradient of As contamination and differing mixing regimes. In three shallow lakes with a range of arsenic in profundal sediments (20 to 206 mu g As g-(1)), mean arsenic concentrations ranged from 2.9 to 46.4 mu g g(-1) in snails, 2.6 to 13.9 mu g g(-1) in crayfish, and 0.07 to 0.61 mu g g(-1) in sunfish. Comparatively, organisms in the deep, contaminated lake (208 mu g g(-1), in profundal sediments) averaged 11.8 mu g g(-1) in snails and 0.06 mu g g(-1) in sunfish. Using inorganic As concentrations, we calculated that consuming aquatic species from the most As-contaminated shallow lake resulted in 4-10 times greater health risks compared to the deep lake with the same arsenic concentrations in profundal sediments. We show that dynamics in shallow, polymictic lakes can result in greater As bioavailability compared to deeper, seasonally stratified lakes. Arsenic in oxygenated waters and littoral sediments was more indicative of exposure to aquatic species than profundal sediments, and therefore we recommend that sampling methods focus on these shallow zones to better indicate the potential for uptake into organisms and human health risk.

The purpose of this research was to investigate the large-scale genetic diversity and biogeography patterns within large cascade dams and to reveal the key drivers shaping eukaryotic plankton community. Eukaryotic plankton communities of 24 sampling sites along the upper Yangtze River were assessed based on Illumina Miseq sequencing. Generally, the mainly dominant eukaryotic plankton communities were Cryptophyta, Fungi and Alveolata, with these three clades encompassing 52.36%, 24.34% and 15.26% of all sequences. Generally, the Shannon diversity was higher in the dry season than that in the flood season, varying from 0.60 to 3.83 in the flood season and 1.41-4.53 in the dry season. Moreover, the alpha-diversity index decreased significantly from the upstream to the downstream. Principal coordinate analysis of the eukaryotic plankton taxa yielded a distinct biogeographical distribution pattern between different seasons and locations. Redundancy analysis results suggested that total organic carbon, DO, Chl a and PC have significant influence on the community compositions. Variation partitioning analysis indicated that the purely environmental variables, pure spatial variables, pure hydrological variables explained 17.5%, 5.1% and 10.0% of the community. The distance decay analysis (eukaryotic plankton community dissimilarity and site location) also suggests that geographical distance was important in structuring the eukaryotic plankton community and determining the spatial dissimilarity in the river network. Our findings show that eukaryotic plankton community across the upper Yangtze River exhibit an ecological succession along the river continuum, and this is primarily driven by the combination of environmental, spatial and hydrological variables in the river-reservoir system.					; Zou, Xi/MGA-5007-2025; yang, jixiang/AAC-5223-2019; Li, Zhe/J-4626-2016	yang, jixiang/0000-0003-4462-9575; Li, Zhe/0000-0003-1743-7906													0022-1694	1879-2707				NOV	2020	590								125495	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125495	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125495													WOS:000599754500198

Satellite data allowed the mapping of cyanobacteria surface accumulations, so-called "scums", and of chlorophyll-a concentration. The 34-year time series shows a tendency towards later occurrence (October-November) of the cyanobacteria scum presence, whereas the period of its onset (June-July) remains relatively constant. The periods when scums are present, "hot moments", have been consistently increasing in duration since 2008. The differences in the starting, ending and annual duration of cyanobacteria blooms have been significantly altered by hydrometeorological conditions (river discharge, water temperature, and wind conditions) and their year-round patterns. The most important environmental factors that determined the temporal changes of the scum presence and area were the standing stock of cyanobacteria and the ambient wind conditions. The "hotspots", the areas where the blooms most likely occur, were distributed in the south-southwestern and central parts of the lagoon. The least affected areas were the northern part, which is connected to the coastal waters of the Baltic Sea and the Nemunas River delta region. The longstanding, well-established spatial patterns of cyanobacteria blooms were linked to hydrodynamic features, namely water renewal time and current patterns, and to potential nutrient sources that included muddy sediments and the locations of colonies of piscivorous birds. Our findings confirmed that the annual and seasonal variations of cyanobacteria blooms and their regulation are a complex issue due to interactions between multiple factors over spatially and temporally broad scales. Despite great progress in the prevention and control of eutrophication and cyanobacteria blooms, the lagoon is still considered to be in a poor ecological status. This work provides a new and missing understanding on the spatial and temporal extent of cyanobacteria blooms and the factors that govern them. Such an understanding can help in planning management strategies, forecasting the magnitude and severity of blooms under changing nutrient loads and potential climate scenarios.

However, the accuracy of the SREs is likely to vary from region to region and must be evaluated on a local basis. This study evaluated the accuracy of three SREs for the Lake Tana basin in northwestern Ethiopia. This basin is characterized by complex topography comprising both lowlands and highlands. The three SREs were the Tropical Applications of Meteorology using SATellite data and ground-based observations (TAMSAT), the Climate Hazard Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS), and the Africa Rainfall Climatology (ARC). The SREs were compared with gauge measurements in lowland and highland regions during the period 1995-2010 on a point-to-pixel basis at daily, dekadal (10 days), monthly, and seasonal periodicities. The results show that the three SREs underestimated rainy events, but TAMSAT captured rainfall occurrence relatively well in both regions. ARC better estimated light rain rates (1-5 mm d(-1)) than did TAMSAT and CHIRPS; however, all the SREs markedly underestimated moderate and heavier rain rates (>= 10 mm d(-1)). TAMSAT and CHIRPS estimated the amount of rainfall reasonably well (high efficiency, low random errors, and bias < 10%) at daily, dekadal, and monthly time scales, whereas ARC did not perform satisfactorily (high random errors, low efficiency, and bias > 20%) at any time scale. On a seasonal scale, CHIRPS estimated the secondary rainy season (March-May) rainfall better than did ARC and TAMSAT, whereas TAMSAT outperformed both CHIRPS and ARC during the primary rainy season (June-September). Overall, the rainfall detection capabilities and rainfall amount estimates of the SREs were better over the lowlands, and the cumulative rainfall estimates tended to improve with increasing integration time (i.e., from daily to seasonal totals).

J	Wi, S; Steinschneider, S				Wi, Sungwook; Steinschneider, Scott			On the need for physical constraints in deep learning rainfall-runoff projections under climate change: a sensitivity analysis to warming and shifts in potential evapotranspiration	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Deep learning (DL) rainfall-runoff models outperform conceptual, process-based models in a range of applications. However, it remains unclear whether DL models can produce physically plausible projections of streamflow under climate change. We investigate this question through a sensitivity analysis of modeled responses to increases in temperature and potential evapotranspiration (PET), with other meteorological variables left unchanged. Previous research has shown that temperature-based PET methods overestimate evaporative water loss under warming compared with energy budget-based PET methods. We therefore assume that reliable streamflow responses to warming should exhibit less evaporative water loss when forced with smaller, energy-budget-based PET compared with temperature-based PET. We conduct this assessment using three conceptual, process-based rainfall-runoff models and three DL models, trained and tested across 212 watersheds in the Great Lakes basin. The DL models include a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM), a mass-conserving LSTM (MC-LSTM), and a novel variant of the MC-LSTM that also respects the relationship between PET and evaporative water loss (MC-LSTM-PET). After validating models against historical streamflow and actual evapotranspiration, we force all models with scenarios of warming, historical precipitation, and both temperature-based (Hamon) and energy-budget-based (Priestley-Taylor) PET, and compare their responses in long-term mean daily flow, low flows, high flows, and seasonal streamflow timing. We also explore similar responses using a national LSTM fit to 531 watersheds across the United States to assess how the inclusion of a larger and more diverse set of basins influences signals of hydrological response under warming. The main results of this study are as follows:The three Great Lakes DL models substantially outperform all process-based models in streamflow estimation. The MC-LSTM-PET also matches the best process-based models and outperforms the MC-LSTM in estimating actual evapotranspiration. All process-based models show a downward shift in long-term mean daily flows under warming, but median shifts are considerably larger under temperature-based PET (17 % to 25 %) than energy-budget-based PET (6 % to 9 %). The MC-LSTM-PET model exhibits similar differences in water loss across the different PET forcings. Conversely, the LSTM exhibits unrealistically large water losses under warming using Priestley-Taylor PET (20 %), while the MC-LSTM is relatively insensitive to the PET method. DL models exhibit smaller changes in high flows and seasonal timing of flows as compared with the process-based models, while DL estimates of low flows are within the range estimated by the process-based models. Like the Great Lakes LSTM, the national LSTM also shows unrealistically large water losses under warming (25 %), but it is more stable when many inputs are changed under warming and better aligns with process-based model responses for seasonal timing of flows.Ultimately, the results of this sensitivity analysis suggest that physical considerations regarding model architecture and input variables may be necessary to promote the physical realism of deep-learning-based hydrological projections under climate change.

J	Horváth, D				Horvath, Dora			EMPLOYED MARKETING INSTRUMENTS IN HEALTH AND THERMAL TOURISM IN TRANS-DANUBIA, HUNGARY	DETUROPE-THE CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND TOURISM												It's clearly that tourism is nowadays very important in most countries of the EU. Many want to deal with it and be rich. But you should not forget, however, that everything is a division even and profitability mainly depends on whether you do it well or not. Tourism comprises the totality of all phenomena and relationships that are associated with leaving the usual food point and staying at another destination. This leads to the diversity of the types of travelers in tourism. The first documented travel packages were organized from 1841 by the famous Thomas Cook. Crucial determinants of the development of global tourism are the increase achieved by the technical progress in labor productivity and the resulting increase in individual incomes as well as increased leisure time. Furthermore, the increased life expectancy, the increased standard of living and thus coherently the increased level of education are particularly noteworthy. Moreover, the development of transport on the land, at sea and in the air, the development of information technology and the absence or the permeability formerly existing political boundaries provides crucial momentum for the ever-increasing economic importance of tourism. Short about the history of the Union. The following European politicians (Konrad Adenauer, Joseph Bench, Johan Willem Beyen, Winston Churchill, Alcide de Gasperi, Walter Hallstein, Sicco Mansholt, Jean Monnet, Robert Schuman, Paul-Henri Spaak and Altiero Spinelli) and their vision of a united Europe have we owe the creation of the European Union in which we live today. Without their energy and determination we would not have the peace and stability in Europe, which we now take for granted. This, already mentioned politicians have had a great idea: a peaceful, united and economically successful Europe. The European Union was founded with the aim of ending the frequent wars between neighboring countries to an end. The tourism industry in the European Union has an important place in the economies of the Member States with its enormous employment potential. It is clear that the connection to the Union has outstanding impact. In 2004 and 2005, more foreigners came to 11.7% and 22.6% in Hungary to their leisure time in a hotel to spend, as in 2003 (prior to our port). The number of foreign overnight stays is also increased by 10.3% and 15.2%. The new decade, so in 2010 began with a dire economic crisis, but also with the hope that closer European cooperation sustainable growth and prosperity will bring. From 2012, the percentages of the statistics have increased dramatically. The arrivals and the overnight stays were by 69.9% and 39.9% were increased. The effects of the global economic crisis in 2009 are also visible on the data. In 2010, the number of arriving has fallen by 1% in the case of medical tourism but in 2011 the same number has risen already to 21%. In 2014, this increase was 47.7%. The popularity of medical tourism also affects the arrivals of foreigners in the various tourist regions. It is clear that in addition to the capital, and Western Transdanubia Balaton are very popular. Mostly visiting Austrians, German and Russ countries Western Hungary and the region of Lake Balaton. The connection to the European Union has deviated many positive effects. Tourism is in fact in the EU countries an important sector, which accounts for 4.7% of GDP, 6% of employment and 215 of services exports. If you want to find out how competitive the tourism industry, one needs accurate information on the volume of tourism, its characteristics, the profile of the target groups and the tourism expenditure and the benefits for the European economies.																			1821-2506						2020	12	2					105	121																WOS:000616662600007

M.; Haile, Alemseged Tamiru; Makurira, Hodson; Reggiani, Paolo			Performance of bias-correction schemes for CMORPH rainfall estimates in the Zambezi River basin	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Satellite rainfall estimates (SREs) are prone to bias as they are indirect derivatives of the visible, infrared, and/or microwave cloud properties, and hence SREs need correction. We evaluate the influence of elevation and distance from large-scale open water bodies on bias for Climate Prediction Center-MORPHing (CMORPH) rainfall estimates in the Zambezi basin. The effectiveness of five linear/non-linear and time-space-variant/-invariant bias-correction schemes was evaluated for daily rainfall estimates and climatic seasonality. The schemes used are spatio-temporal bias (STB), elevation zone bias (EZ), power transform (PT), distribution transformation (DT), and quantile mapping based on an empirical distribution (QME). We used daily time series (1998-2013) from 60 gauge stations and CMORPH SREs for the Zambezi basin. To evaluate the effectiveness of the bias-correction schemes spatial and temporal cross-validation was applied based on eight stations and on the 1998-1999 CMORPH time series, respectively. For correction, STB and EZ schemes proved to be more effective in removing bias. STB improved the correlation coefficient and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency by 50 % and 53 %, respectively, and reduced the root mean squared difference and relative bias by 25 % and 33 %, respectively. Paired t tests showed that there is no significant difference (p < 0.05) in the daily means of CMORPH against gauge rainfall after bias correction. ANOVA post hoc tests revealed that the STB and EZ bias-correction schemes are preferable. Bias is highest for very light rainfall (<2 5 mm d(-1)), for which most effective bias reduction is shown, in particular for the wet season. Similar findings are shown through quantile-quantile (q-q) plots. The spatial cross-validation approach revealed that most bias-correction schemes removed bias by > 28 %. The temporal cross-validation approach showed effectiveness of the bias-correction schemes. Taylor diagrams show that station elevation has an influence on CMORPH performance. Effects of distance > 10 km from large-scale open water bodies are minimal, whereas effects at shorter distances are indicated but are not conclusive for a lack of rain gauges. Findings of this study show the importance of applying bias correction to SREs.					gumindoga, webster/AAV-6642-2021; Reggiani, Paolo/Y-4556-2019														1027-5606	1607-7938				JUL 12	2019	23	7					2915	2938		10.5194/hess-23-2915-2019	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-2915-2019													WOS:000475371800002

The DIC fertilization may increase the strength of BCP. As a phase of BCP, eutrophication is one of the major problems in surface water environments which shows poor water quality with harmful cyanobacteria blooms. It is generally believed that the controlling elements of eutrophication are nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), while the controlling elements of BCP also includes carbon (C). Meanwhile P removal by BCPs through the coprecipitation of P with calcite and Fe (III) oxyhydroxide colloids decreases its content in water bodies and prevent water from cyanobacteria eutrophication. In the present study, we examine the seasonal variations of general physiochemical parameters of the surface water, DIC, total N and total P concentrations, chlorophyll concentrations in three karst river-reservoir systems (PZR, PDR and HFR) in Guizhou Province, Southwest China. The phytoplankton community structure dynamics and the settling flux of the total P and P fractions in the settling particulate matter in PZR and HFR were also examined. It was found that: (1) the nutrient limitations of BCPs shifted from C-limitation to N- or Plimitation after the rivers were dammed; (2) P removal by BCPs reduced the total P concentration and increased the stoichiometric N:P ratio in surface waters; (3) P removal by BCPs alleviated the development of eutrophication by decreasing the relative abundance of Cyanobacteria. Our results demonstrate that the damming of a river may shift the nutrient limitation patterns of dammed karst rivers and the P removal by BCP may retard the development of water body into Cyanophyta-type eutrophication. This may have important implications for eutrophication control (i.e., strengthening BCP effect via DIC fertilization) in HCO3-Ca type surface water, especially in karst areas, which cover about 15% of the world land surface.					; Liu, Zaihua/K-2869-2013; Yan, Hao/ADU-0143-2022; ZHANG, YIFEI/GRO-0728-2022	Qian, Bao/0000-0002-5230-7587; ma, ma song/0000-0003-1545-5043; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				APR	2022	607									10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127480	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127480		JAN 2022											WOS:000752095500004

Considering the sparseness of hydro-meteorological stations on northern areas, this study investigates the benefits and downfalls of univariate streamflow modeling at high latitudes using GP and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA). Furthermore, a new evolutionary time series model, called GP-SARIMA, is introduced to enhance streamflow forecasting accuracy at long-term horizons in a lake-river system. The paper includes testing the new model for one-step-ahead forecasts of daily mean, weekly mean, and monthly mean streamflow in the headwaters of the Oulujoki River, Finland. The results showed that a combination of correlogram and average mutual information (AMI) analysis might yield in the selection of the optimum lags that are needed to be used as the predictors of streamflow models. With Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values of more than 99%, both GP and SARIMA models exhibited good performance for daily streamflow prediction. However, they were not able to precisely model the intramonthly snow water equivalent in the long-term forecast. The proposed ensemble model, which integrates the best GP and SARIMA models with the most efficient predictor, may eliminate one-fourth of root mean squared errors of standalone models. The GP-SARIMA also showed up to three times improvement in the accuracy of the standalone models based on the Nash-Sutcliff efficiency measure.

Forty parameters in Environmental Fluid Dynamic Code model (EFDC) were filtered and analyzed. The results showed that parameters had a considerable influence on simulation and three groups of parameters related to algal kinetics (i.e. PMc, BMRc and PRRc), light (KeChl) and temperature (KTG1c) were very sensitive. For shallow lakes with frequent algal blooms, light extinction due to Chlorophyll-a is also a sensitive parameter. While the temperature effect coefficient for algal growth is sensitive for lakes with seasonal temperature variation. Sensitive parameters and their relevant uncertainty varied spatially. For high nutrients and algae concentration subareas, temperature was more likely to be a limiting factor, whereas sensitive factors could be light in lower concentration subareas. Since most sensitive parameters were related to algae, uncertainty in simulation increased with increasing algal kinetic processes over time and varied in different sub-areas. Lower nutrients and algae concentration subareas were more easily influenced by model parameters while nearshore areas were highly influenced by boundary conditions. For better simulation of water quality, variable stoichiometry phytoplankton models should be considered and zooplankton need to be integrated into the model explicitly rather than a fixed predation rate.

In this study, we investigated the relationships between water quality and landscape pattern (composition and configuration) in Huzhou City, China. The water quality variables, including pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (CODMn), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), NH3-N, petroleum, dissolved total phosphorus (DTP), and total nitrogen (TN) in low water, normal water and flood periods were identified by investigating 34 sampling sites in Huzhou City during the period from 2001 to 2007. Landscape composition and landscape configuration metrics were calculated for different scales. It was found that scales and seasons both play important role when analyzing the relationships between landscape characteristics of different land use types. The results implied that some water quality parameters such as CODMn, petroleum are more polluted in flood period than the other two seasons at different scales, while DTP and TN are more polluted in low water period. Influences of different landscape metrics on water quality should operate at different spatial scales. The results shown in this paper will effectively provide scientific basis for the policy making in sustainable development of water environment.					zhang, zhonghao/JDW-3279-2023														2045-2322					MAY 5	2016	6								25250	10.1038/srep25250	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep25250								27147104					WOS:000375476000001

EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Lake-aquifer interactions have been the subject of investigation and debate for decades. Traditional investigation methods include measurement of water flux across the groundwater-surface water interface, application of heat and environmental tracer methods, conducting numerical simulations of the water flow, and mass balance-based approaches. We first review, evaluate and describe the different approaches that have been applied for examining lake-aquifer interactions and propose an additional complementary approach. While the leakage from lakes and its slow movement through porous media (laminar flow) is well characterized by existing methods, modeling the rapid and turbulent flow through preferred pathways (faults/karst) remains a challenging task. To better understand the nature, and the full scale, of the lake aquifer interactions, and using Lake Nasser and the underlying Dakhla subbasin of the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System (NSAS) in the Western Desert of Egypt (area: 0.66 x 10(6) km(2)) as a test site, we examine, model, and correlate temporally and spatially, the variations in Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment terrestrial water storage (GRACE(TWS)) solutions, with precipitation, lake levels, area, and water volume. We review current GRACE applications in hydrology and present our novel approach. Findings include: firstly, large seasonal fluctuations (peak: Nov./Dec.; trough: July/Aug.) in Lake Nasser's surface water levels (average annual fluctuations: from 3.7 m to 7.5 m), area (average area: 3622 km(2) but up to 4530 km(2)), and volume (annual average: 13.4 km(3), and up to 34 km(3)) are observed throughout years 2006 to 2015. These fluctuations are accompanied by an increase in GRACE(TWS) (average: 50 +/- 13 mm/yr, up to 77 +/- 18 mm/yr) over Lake Nasser and by a progression of a front of increasing GRACE(TWS) values (> 50 +/- 13 mm) away from the lake reaching distances of up to 700 km some 3 to 5 months following peak lake level periods. The areas witnessing the seasonal increase in GRACE(TWS) display a progressive increase in phase and decrease in amplitude with distance from the lake. Secondly, the negligible precipitation over the Dakhla subbasin cannot account for the observed seasonal GRACE(TWS) patterns and neither can the leakage signal from Lake Nasser. Thirdly, overall similarities in the distribution of GRACE(TWS) seasonal spatial patterns are observed. During high lake level periods (e.g., Dec. 2007; Feb. 2015) additional, and more distant, areas from Lake Nasser saw increases in GRACE(TWS) and vice versa during low lake level periods (e.g., July 2006; Aug. 2010). These observations are consistent with Lake Nasser being the main source of modern recharge for the Dakhla subbasin and suggest a new conceptual model for the subbasin: a slow groundwater flow through a porous matrix and a rapid groundwater flow along a network of faults, fractures, and karst topography across the matrix. We suggest that the proposed conceptual model for the interaction between Lake Nasser and the Dakhla subbasin could be applicable to aquifers of similar geologic, climatic, and hydrologic settings worldwide and that approaches similar to those advocated here could be used to investigate the validity of this suggestion.

Deep chlorophyll maxima across a trophic state gradient: A case study in the Laurentian Great Lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) are common in stratified lakes and oceans, and phytoplankton growth within DCM often contributes significantly to total system production. Theory suggests that properties of DCM should be predictable by trophic state, with DCM becoming deeper, broader, and less productive with greater oligotrophy. However, rigorous tests of these expectations are lacking in freshwater systems. We use data generated by the U.S. EPA from 1996 to 2017, including in situ profile data for temperature, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), chlorophyll, beam attenuation (c(p)), and dissolved oxygen (DO), to investigate patterns in DCM across lakes and over time. We consider trophic state, 1% PAR depth (z(1%)), thermal structure, and degree of photoacclimation as potential drivers of DCM characteristics. DCM depth and thickness generally increased while DCM chlorophyll concentration decreased with decreasing trophic state index (greater oligotrophy). Thez(1%)was a stronger predictor of DCM depth than thermal structure. DCM in meso-oligotrophic waters were closely aligned with maxima inc(p)and DO saturation, suggesting they are autotrophically productive. However, the depths of these maxima diverged in ultra-oligotrophic waters, with DCM occurring deepest. This is likely a consequence of photoacclimation in high-transparency waters, wherec(p)can be a better proxy for phytoplankton biomass than chlorophyll. Our results are generally consistent with expectations from DCM theory, but they also identify specific gaps in our understanding of DCM in lakes, including the causes of multiple DCM, the importance of nutriclines, and the processes forming DCM at higher light levels than expected.

Despite the booming irrigation activities in the sub-basin, limited information exists on the rate of irrigation expansion and its impact on the water balance of the sub-basin. This study collected and organized smallholder irrigation data in the sub basin to identify the actual irrigated area, the abstracted irrigation water, and its implications on seasonal water availability. The area under small-scale irrigation was estimated through data obtained from 'woredas' (districts) databases. Crop patterns were obtained through field surveys. Irrigation water abstracted at daily timescale was measured. New hydrological insights for the Region: In the sub-basin, 38,694 ha was under small-scale irrigation in 2020/21. Surface water is the dominant water source, and it supplies about 80% of irrigation withdrawal. Water abstraction for small-scale irrigation is about 430 MCM per dry season (similar to 50% of dry season flow). The eastern side of the sub-basin faces water shortages as the dry season flow is not sufficient for irrigation. With the prospects of more irrigation expansion, small-scale irrigation water withdrawals pose concerns of water scarcity at local level and to the water balance of the sub-basin. Hence, there is urgent need for adaptive management of the small-scale irrigation effect on the sub-basin's hydrology.

Here, we investigated the effect of water pH, temperature, and hydraulic disturbance on the release of heavy metals and nutrients from the sediment of drinking water reservoir. The results show that lower initial water pH promoted the Zn release, while low temperature enhanced the Mn flux after 15 days. Meanwhile, continuous disturbance caused more metals releasing from sediment than intermittent disturbance due to greater shear stress and turbulence effect. However, intermittent high-speed disturbance greatly altered the dynamic release of Zn from L-shaped curve to U-shape in water column. Moreover, lower water pH caused higher ammonium in water but lower nitrate since H+ restrained the nitrification. Yet, higher temperature inhibited the release of ammonium from sediment, which might relate to the accelerated mineralization of organic nitrogen and elevated dissolved oxygen caused by the algae growth. Notably, hydraulic disturbance with various intensity and duration greatly influenced the fluxes of various species of nitrogen and soluble phosphate in water column, because the disturbance facilitated the nitrogen and phosphorus exchanges between sediment-water and water-air interfaces. Practitioner points Lower water pH induced Zn release, while low temperature gradually enhanced Mn level. More metals were released from sediment under continuous disturbance than intermittent disturbance. Lower water pH caused higher ammonium nitrogen in water but lower nitrate nitrogen. Higher temperature inhibited the release of ammonium nitrogen from sediment. Hydraulic disturbance greatly changed the release of different species of nitrogen and soluble phosphate from sediment.																			1061-4303	1554-7531				OCT	2021	93	10					2135	2148		10.1002/wer.1587	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wer.1587		JUN 2021						34013658					WOS:000658283200001

The effects of spatial and temporal replicate sampling on eDNA metabarcoding	PEERJ												Background: The heterogeneous nature of environmental DNA (eDNA) and its effects on species detection and community composition estimates has been highlighted in several studies in the past decades. Mostly in the context of spatial distribution over large areas, in fewer occasions looking at spatial distribution within a single body of water. Temporal variation of eDNA, similarly, has mostly been studied as seasonality, observing changes over large periods of time, and often only for small groups of organisms such as fish and amphibians. Methods: We analyzed and compared small-scale spatial and temporal variation by sampling eDNA from two small, isolated dune lakes for 20 consecutive weeks. Metabarcoding was performed on the samples using generic COI primers. Molecular operational taxonomic unit (MOTUs) were used to assess dissimilarities between spatial and temporal replicates. Results: Our results show large differences between samples taken within one lake at one point in time, but also expose the large differences between temporal replicates, even those taken only 1 week apart. Furthermore, between-site dissimilarities showed a linear correlation with time frame, indicating that between-site differences will be inflated when samples are taken over a period of time. We also assessed the effects of PCR replicates and processing strategies on general patterns of dissimilarity between samples. While more inclusive PCR replicate strategies lead to higher richness estimations, dissimilarity patterns between samples did not significantly change. Conclusions: We conclude that the dissimilarity of temporal replicates at a 1 week interval is comparable to that of spatial replicate samples. It increases, however, for larger time intervals, which suggests that population turnover effects can be stronger than community heterogeneity. Spatial replicates alone may not be enough for optimal recovery of taxonomic diversity, and cross-comparisons of different locations are susceptible to inflated dissimilarities when performed over larger time intervals. Many of the observed MOTUs could be classified as either phyto-or zooplankton, two groups that have gained traction in recent years as potential novel bio-indicator species. Our results, however, indicate that these groups might be susceptible to large community shifts in relatively short periods of time, highlighting the need to take temporal variations into consideration when assessing their usability as water quality indicators.					; Speksnijder, Adrianus/M-3406-2017; Speksnijder, Arjen/M-3406-2017; van der Hoorn, Berry/D-3282-2018; Schilthuizen, Menno/B-5156-2009; Beentjes, Kevin/AAA-6143-2021	Beentjes, Kevin/0000-0001-7669-3809; Speksnijder, Adrianus/0000-0002-1966-7265; Schilthuizen, Menno/0000-0001-6229-0347; 													2167-8359					JUL 26	2019	7								e7335	10.7717/peerj.7335	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.7335								31388472					WOS:000477563800004
J	Deng, Y; Yao, Y; Zhang, L				Deng, Yue; Yao, Yuan; Zhang, Lin			Analysis of urban wetland park cooling effects and their potential influence factors: Evidence from 477 urban wetland parks in China	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Urban wetland parks can lower surrounding temperatures efficiently and play a critical role in mitigating extreme urban high-temperature weather. Understanding the urban wetland park cooling effects and their potential influence factors is necessary for the management plan of urban parks. This study first crawled 477 urban wetland parks from the Baidu Map and classified the urban wetland parks into river-based and lake-based urban wetland parks based on the distance to rivers. Then, this study investigated the urban wetland park cooling effects during the warm (April-September) and cold (January-March, and October-December) seasons based on the largest cooling distance (LCD), the largest cooling intensity (LCI), the random forest (RF) and the partial least squares (PLS) regression models, and Spearman's correlation coefficient. The results show that: (1) Both river -based and lake-based urban wetland parks exhibit a stronger cooling effect during the warm season. Lake -based urban wetland parks have a higher LCI; however, river-based parks have a higher LCD. (2) The RF model outperforms the PLS model in modeling the relationship between LCI and the potential influence factors, with a 5.68% increase in average RMSE and a 20.64% increase in R2.(3) The water cover fraction inside urban wetland parks is the most influential factor. There is a strong similarity in the relative importance of potential influence factors to river-based and lake-based urban wetland parks. The study indicates a new park should be located with priority in regions with more impervious layers, for example, the high-density building areas. Be-sides, a new park should limit the proportion of impervious layers to less than 13% and ensure the proportion of water bodies is at 70% at least to obtain a stronger cooling effect. Our study reinforces the understanding of urban wetland park cooling effects and has critical implications for better management plan of urban parks to mitigate the urban heat problem.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC 1	2023	156								111103	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111103		OCT 2023											WOS:001097753800001

Sinninghe			Seasonal and multi-annual variation in the abundance of isoprenoid GDGT membrane lipids and their producers in the water column of a meromictic equatorial crater lake (Lake Chala, East Africa)	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (isoGDGTs) are membrane lipids of Archaea. Organic biomarker proxies associated with these lipids, such as the TEX 86 paleothermometer and Branched and Isoprenoid Tetraether (BIT) index, are often used in paleoenvironmental reconstructions for the marine environment, but their general applicability in lacustrine settings is hampered by limited understanding of the biological sources and environmental drivers influencing isoGDGT production. To validate the use of isoGDGT proxies in lakes, we studied the occurrence of isoGDGTs in Lake Chala, a permanently stratified (meromictic) crater lake in equatorial East Africa. We analyzed the abundance and distribution of isoGDGTs in 17 depth profiles of suspended particulate matter (SPM) collected monthly between September 2013 and January 2015, and compared this with the abundance and composition of archaea based on 16S rRNA gene and quantitative PCR analysis. Both isoGDGTs and archaeal abundance in the SPM were exceptionally low throughout the study period. In the oxygenated part of the water column, higher fractional abundances of crenarchaeol are matched by a predominance of the ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota I.1b that are known to produce this GDGT, whereas deep anoxic water layers are characterized by high fractional abundances of GDGT-0 as well as the anaerobic heterotrophic Group C3 MCG Bathyarchaea and specific euryarchaeotal methanogens. Analysis of intact polar lipid (IPL) isoGDGTs using SPM depth profiles from three months representing distinct seasons during the study period revealed the presence of several IPLs of GDGT-0 in the anoxic lower water column, which are rarely found in natural settings. IPL GDGT-0 with a phosphatidylglycerol (PG-), monohexosephosphatidylglycerol (MH-PG-) and dihexose-phosphatidylglycerol (DH-PG-) head-group was typically only present just above the lake bottom at 90 m depth and probably reflect specific communities of anaerobic archaea. We also determined the flux and distribution of isoGDGTs in settling particles collected monthly between November 2006 and January 2015 from a sediment trap suspended at 35 m water depth to assess seasonal and inter-annual variability in surface-water isoGDGT production, and compared this with the temporal distribution of isoGDGTs in the 25,000-year long sediment record from Lake Chala. Monthly variation of isoGDGTs in the 98-month settling-particles record did not show a strong annual pattern related to seasonal water-column mixing and stratification, likely because the oxycline was regularly situated below sediment-trap depth. Episodes of high GDGT-0 concentrations relative to crenarchaeol in the settling particles can therefore be linked to periods of exceptionally shallow oxycline depth, which suppresses the thaumarchaeotal bloom. During such intervals, TEX86 based paleotemperatures are not reliable because isoGDGT input from other archaeal sources disproportionally influences TEX86 values and creates a cold-temperature bias. Additionally, the abundance of the crenarchaeol isomer relative to crenarchaeol (f[CREN]) gradually increases during such episodes of high GDGT-0/crenarchaeol ratio, suggesting increasing dominance of Group I.1b over Group I.1a Thaumarchaeota, and might prove a good marker for prolonged shallow-oxycline conditions. Most importantly, the associated near-absence of crenarchaeol during times of strong upper-water-column stratification results in high BIT-index values. We propose that this suppression mechanism may be the principal driver of BIT-index variation in the sediment record of Lake Chala, and the main source of observed congruence between the BIT index and climate-driven lake-level variation on long time scales.

Phosphorus fractions in the sediment of a tropical reservoir, India: Implications for pollution source identification and eutrophication	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH												Eutrophication level in lakes and reservoirs depends on both internal and external phosphorus (P) load. Characterization of sediment P fractionation and identifying the P pollution sources are important for assessing the bio-availability of P and the dominant P source, for effectively controlling the water pollution. For determining the availability and sources of sediment P and eutrophication status, spatio-temporal variation in different P fractionation of sediment of hyper-eutrophic Krishnagiri reservoir, Tamil Nadu, India, was investigated. Sediment average total P (TP) content ranged from 4.62 to 5.64 g/kg. Main phosphorus form was the inorganic P (IP), and it makes up to 73.4-87.7% of TP. Among the different P fraction, viz. calcium bound (Ca-P), iron bound (Fe-P), aluminium bound (Al-P), exchangeable (Ex-P) and Organic-P (Org-P), Ca-P was the dominating fraction in both IP and TP. Trend of IP fraction was as follows: Ca-P > Fe-P > Al-P > Ex-P in pre-monsoon season, Fe-P > Ca-P > Al-P > Ex-P in monsoon and Ca-P > Al-P > Fe-P > Ex-P in post-monsoon. Overall the trend was as follows Ca-P > Fe-P > Al-P > Org-P > Ex-P. Bio-available-P (BAP) fractions ranged from 35.2 to 64.0% of TP, indicating its comparative higher value. Pearson's correlation matrix revealed that there was strong correlation among the different P fractions. Factor analysis indicates that different fractions of P were the dominating factor than the other sediment parameters. The observed variation in sediment P fractionation indicate the differences in source and characterization of P which is very helpful for implementation of effective management practices in controlling pollution that arises due to phosphorus in this hyper-eutrophic reservoir.

Their impact depends on community structure, which varies along time. However, very few studies take into account temporal variation. This is especially true for small, shallow freshwater systems, which remain largely understudied despite their wide variety, global surface and intense microbial activity. We have monthly followed changes in the community structure of small microbial eukaryotes (0.2-5 mu m cell diameter) for 2 years in four ponds and one brook located in North-Western France based on massive 18S rDNA amplicon 454 pyrosequencing. We detected a total of 3742 stringently defined operational taxonomic units (OTUs) encompassing all recognized eukaryotic supergroups and lineages of uncertain affiliation. Although geographically close, protist communities in the five ecosystems were contrasting, with very few shared OTUs, suggesting that environmental selection mainly drives community structure. The temporal dynamics of different high-rank taxa appeared complex and rapid at monthly scales. Despite this, a clear and reproducible seasonality was observed. As expected, low-abundance OTUs dominated the community. Although some of them appeared sporadically or remained at low frequencies during the survey, others occasionally reached relatively high abundances, sometimes recurrently. This shows that at least a fraction of low-abundance eukaryotes constitutes a seed bank. The annual proportion of primary producers, free-living heterotrophs and parasites appeared remarkably constant among the different ecosystems, suggesting underlying trends of ecosystem carrying capacity for these functional groups.

However, the occurrences of ARGs under different freshwater aquaculture practices are rarely known. Here, we investigated the seasonal profiles of the main ARGs, intI1 and bacteria in waters from three kinds of predominant freshwater aquaculture practices around the Honghu Lake (China), as well as their co-occurrences and interrelationships with antibiotics, heavy metals and general water quality. The results indicate that quinolone resistance genes (qnrB), tetracycline resistance genes (tetB and tetX) and sulfonamide resistance genes (sul1 and sul2) were the top five predominant ARGs with seasonal variations of abundance. Fish ponds were of the highest absolute abun-dances of tested ARGs than the other two modes. Crayfish ponds and their adjacent ditches shared similar ARGs profile. Different subtypes of ARGs belonging to the same class of resistance were varied in abundances. Some bacteria were predicted to carry different ARGs, which indicating multi-antibiotic resistances. Moreover, the combined environmental factors (antibiotics, heavy metals and water quality) partially shaped the profiles of ARGs and bacteria composition. Overall, this study provides new comprehensive understanding on the charac-terization of ARGs contamination in different freshwater aquaculture practices from the perspectives of envi-ronmental chemistry, microbiology and ecology. The results would benefit the optimization of aquaculture practices toward environmental integrity and sustainability.					han, jian/JNE-5325-2023; Yu, Ke/CAG-5947-2022; Xiong, Xiong/GQQ-8712-2022; Yan, Biao/B-5880-2018	Yu, Ke/0000-0001-5039-6056; Wang, Qidong/0000-0003-2082-8457; Yan, Biao/0000-0002-9692-4966													0147-6513	1090-2414				AUG	2022	241								113832	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.113832	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.113832		JUL 2022						36068758					WOS:000861607000001

The restoration of different submerged macrophytes has been considered an effective measure to improve eutrophic lakes. However, the community ecology of epiphytic bacteria is far from well understood for different submerged macrophytes. In this study, we used quantitative PCR, 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing and functional prediction analysis to explore the structure and function of epiphytic bacteria in an aquatic ecosystem recovered by three submerged macrophytes (Hydrilla verticillata, Vallisneria natans and Potamogeton maackianus) during two growth periods. The results showed that the community compositions and functions of epiphytic bacterial communities on the submerged macrophyte hosts were different from those of the planktonic bacterial communities in the surrounding water. The alpha diversity of the epiphytic bacterial community was significantly higher in October than in July, and the community compositions and functions differed significantly in July and October. Among the three submerged macrophytes, the structures and functions of the epiphytic bacterial community exhibited obvious differences, and some specific taxa were enriched on the biofilms of the three plants. The alpha diversity and the abundance of functions related to nitrogen and phosphorus transformation were higher in the epiphytic bacteria of P. maackianus. In summary, these results provide clues for understanding the distribution and formation mechanisms of epiphytic bacteria on submerged macrophyte leaves and their roles in freshwater ecosystems.

Keeping in view the growing pollution and anthropogenic stresses on aquatic ecosystems, we assessed pollution sources in three urban wetlands of Srinagar, India. Environmetric techniques, such as two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were applied to interpret the huge datasets for meaningful deliverables. The water quality (WQ) parameters were assessed at 22 different sites well distributed within the three wetlands. The WQ dataset comprises of 11,616 observations collected from January 2018 to February 2020 across 8 seasons. Two-way ANOVA grouping of variables (wetlands and seasons) showed significant (p < 0.05) interaction on WQ parameters such as water temperature, total hardness, calcium hardness, magnesium hardness, NH4-N, NO2--N, and NO3--N. HCA generated 2 major (high and moderate) clusters based on the similarity of WQ characteristics. Wilk's lambda distribution revealed that independent variables (transparency, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, salinity, and dissolved oxygen) contribute significantly to the separation of groups and consequently indicate their greater discriminant ability. PCA resulted in 4 principal components (PCs) with the 1st PC accounting for a cumulative variance of 56.9%, 2nd PC for 17.8%, 3rd PC for 7%, and fourth PC for 5.9%. Factor analysis resulting from PCs showed that the factors responsible for hyper-eutrophication of the wetlands are nutrient inputs resulting due to ingress of agricultural runoff, raw fecal matter from settlements, and partially treated effluents from sewage treatment plants (STPs).

Two new methods including nonparametric hybrid wavelet Mann-Kendall test and Sen's methodology have been used to determine potential trends in the variables and their dominant periods. The results showed significant decreasing trends in the water level and streamflow series, moderate decreasing trend in the rainfall and relative humidity series, and increasing trends in the observed temperature data. The 8-, 12-month, and 2-year periods were detected as the dominant periods of the variables in monthly, seasonal, and annual timescales, respectively. The results from the interaction analysis revealed that the main factor influencing the water level at UL is decreasing trend in the streamflow series. Both the monthly series of UL's water level and the streamflow series of the stations indicated two start points of significant decreasing trend in 1973 and 1998. Furthermore, a comparative analysis among the applied methods indicated a good agreement between the results of hybrid wavelet Mann-Kendall test and Sen's trend analyzing method.

These dynamics of land, water, and ice have a significant impact on climate and often are critical to natural ecosystem functioning. However, global seasonal dynamics of both water and ice extent have not been well quantified. Here, we present the quantification of monthly surface water and ice areas for 2019 with associated uncertainties. Time-series reference data were created for a probability sample of 10 m grid cells by interpreting the entire 2019 time-series of 10 m Sentinel-2 data and a subset of 3 m PlanetScope data in selected places with a mix of land and water. From the probability sample reference data, we estimate that 4.86 +/- 0.16 million km(2) had inland water presence at some point during the year. Globally, only 23% of the total area with water was permanent water that remained open year-round (1.13 +/- 0.19 million km(2)). Permanent water with seasonal ice cover extended 1.97 +/- 0.21 million km(2), comprising 41% of the total area with water. Seasonal water-land transitions (both with and without ice/snow cover) covered the remaining 36% of the total area with water (1.76 +/- 0.19 million km(2)). February had the maximum extent of ice over areas of inland permanent and seasonal water, totaling 2.49 +/- 0.25 million km(2), and January - March had a larger global extent of ice cover than of open water. To investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of ice cover and the suitability of Landsat, prototype maps of surface water ice cover phenology were created by integrating the ice/snow and no data labels from the quality assurance layer of the GLAD ARD of Potapov et al. (2020) with the monthly surface water layers of Pickens et al. (2020), both of which are Landsat- based. While limited by data availability, these maps reveal the high spatiotemporal variability of ice phenology. The near-daily observations near the poles and the 10 m resolution bands of Sentinel-2 provide unprecedented potential to examine surface water and ice dynamics for 2016 forward and to investigate the drivers and impacts of this variability.

Cyanobacterial blooms modify food web structure and interactions in western Lake Erie	HARMFUL ALGAE												With anthropogenic eutrophication and climate change causing an increase in cyanobacterial blooms worldwide, the need to understand the consequences of these blooms on aquatic ecosystems is paramount. Key questions remain unanswered with respect to how cyanobacteria blooms affect the structure of aquatic food webs, the foraging abilities of higher consumers, and the potential for cyanotoxins (e.g., microcystins [MCs]) to accumulate in fish. Toward addressing these uncertainties, physicochemical attributes, water (for MCs), phytoplankton, zooplankton, and epipelagic and benthic age-0 fish were sampled at 75 sites (44 sites for fish) of varying cyanobacteria concentration (0.1-44 mu g/L) in western Lake Erie during the cyanobacteria bloom season, 2013-2014. Sites with high cyanobacteria biomass were characterized by Mirrocystis spp. (84-100% of biomass), detectible levels of MCs (maximum = 10.8 mu g/L), and low water transparency (minimum = 0.25 m). Counter to expectations, strong positive relationships were found between cyanobacteria concentration and the biomass of several herbivorous zooplankton taxa (e.g., Daphnia, Diaphanosoma spp., Bosmina (formerly Eubosmina) coregoni, and Calanoida spp.). Expectations regarding fish were partly supported (e.g., diet selectivity varied across a cyanobacteria gradient) and partly not (e.g., consumption of zooplankton did not differ between bloom and nonbloom sites). These findings show that cyanobacterial blooms can strongly affect the distribution, composition, and interactions of zooplankton and fish, sometimes in surprising ways, highlighting the need to further explore their impact on aquatic food webs.

However, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exists ubiquitously in lakes, and its influence on phosphate binding is still not adequately understood. Our results showed that both phosphate and DOC can be adsorbed by LMB. The Langmuir adsorption maxima of phosphate and DOC were 9.06 mg P/g and 5.31 mg C/g, respectively, generating a C/P molar ratio similar to 1.5. When phosphate and DOC coexisted at this ratio, the adsorption of phosphate was not influenced by DOC and vice versa. However, the phosphate capture by LMB was significantly reduced by raising the ratio above similar to 9, and the reduction was increased with increasing the ratio. Once adsorbed by LMB, phosphate was essentially not desorbed by DOC, while adsorbed DOC can be mostly liberated by phosphate. It is deemed that phosphate can interact preferentially with La on LMB. However, DOC can still be adsorbed by LMB, even after LMB was saturated with phosphate, which was attributed to (i) the high coordination capacity of La; (ii) the interaction of DOC with the hydroxyl group(s) of the adsorbed phosphate via hydrogen bonding; and (iii) the interaction of DOC with the La sites unoccupied by phosphate. We proposed that LMB can be applied in the season (time) when the DOC/P ratio in lakes is low enough to facilitate the adsorption of phosphate, which will no longer be released into water, even after the C/P ratio is raised later.

Its reliable prediction is a main issue in many environmental applications, which however is hampered by data scarcity, when using data-demanding deterministic models, and modelling limitations, when using simpler statistical models. In this work we test a suite of models belonging to air2stream family, which are characterized by a hybrid formulation that combines a physical derivation of the key equation with a stochastic calibration of parameters. The air2stream models rely solely on air temperature and streamflow, and are of similar complexity as standard statistical models. The performances of the different versions of air2stream in predicting river water temperature are compared with those of the most common statistical models typically used in the literature. To this aim, a dataset of 38 Swiss rivers is used, which includes rivers classified into four different categories according to their hydrological characteristics: low-land natural rivers, lake outlets, snow-fed rivers and regulated rivers. The results of the analysis provide practical indications regarding the type of model that is most suitable to simulate river water temperature across different time scales (from daily to seasonal) and for different hydrological regimes. A model intercomparison exercise suggests that the family of air2stream hybrid models generally outperforms statistical models, while cross-validation conducted over a 30-year period indicates that they can be suitably adopted for long-term analyses.

The so-called 8.2 ka event was one of the most pronounced and abrupt Holocene cold and arid events. The 9.2 ka event was similar, albeit of a smaller magnitude. Both events affected the Northern Hemisphere climate and caused cooling and aridification in Southwest Asia. Yet, the impacts of the 8.2 and 9.2 ka events on early farming communities in this region are not well understood. Current hypotheses for an effect of the 8.2 ka event vary from large-scale site abandonment and migration (including the Neolithisation of Europe) to continuation of occupation and local adaptation, while impacts of the 9.2 ka have not previously been systematically studied. In this paper, we present a thorough assessment of available, quality-checked radiocarbon (C-14) dates for sites from Southwest Asia covering the time interval between 9500 and 7500 cal BP, which we interpret in combination with archaeological evidence. In this way, the synchronicity between changes observed in the archaeological record and the rapid climate events is tested. It is shown that there is no evidence for a simultaneous and widespread collapse, large-scale site abandonment, or migration at the time of the events. However, there are indications for local adaptation. We conclude that early farming communities were resilient to the abrupt, severe climate changes at 9250 and 8200 cal BP. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Since 2012, we have investigated a stratigraphic section encompassing the late Eocene-earliest Oligocene interval at Shapaja (Tarapoto area, Peruvian Amazonia, ca. 7 degrees S), through paleontological and geological fieldwork. The measured sedimentary series (120 m-thick [West] plus 90 m-thick [East]), assigned to the upper member of the Pozo Formation, records fluvial micro-conglomeratic lenses intercalated with floodplain and evaporite-rich fine red deposits, estuarine/coastal-plain tidally-influenced fine sandstones, and oxbow lake nodule-rich blue clays. This sedimentary shift coincides locally with the demise of the large Eocene coastal-plain wetland known as Pozo System. The late Eocene-early Oligocene Shapaja section was extensively sampled for chemostratigraphy (delta C-13 on dispersed organic matter and pedogenic carbonate nodules), which in turn allowed for refining the location of the Eocene-Oligocene Transition (EOT) and other climatic events recognized at a global scale (i.e., Oi1 and Oi-1a). The section has yielded nine fossil localities with plant remains (leaves, wood, charophytes, and palynomorphs), mollusks, decapods, and/or vertebrates (selachians, actinopterygians, lungfishes, amphibians, sauropsids, and mammals), documenting-130 distinct taxa. Four localities of the upper member of the Pozo Formation at Shapaja predate the EOT, one is clearly within the EOT, while four are earliest/early Oligocene in age. The small leaf impressions found along the Shapaja section could be indicative of dry and/or seasonal conditions for this region throughout and after the EOT. Monkeys, indicative of tropical rainforest environments, are only recorded in a latest Eocene locality (TAR-21). Two biotic turnovers are perceptible in the selachian, metatherian, and rodent communities, well before the EOT [-35-36 Ma] and a few hundred thousand years after the EOT [-33 Ma]. The latter turnover seems to be primarily related to a global sea-level drop (ichthyofauna: marine-littoral elements replaced by obligate freshwater taxa) and/or the onset of a drier and more seasonal climate in early Oligocene times (terrestrial components). Changes in the structure of the Shapaja paleocommunities were mostly driven by the flexural subsidence during the late Eocene, and then globally driven by the earliest Oligocene climatic deterioration.

J	Woolway, RI; Jennings, E; Carrea, L				Woolway, R. Iestyn; Jennings, Eleanor; Carrea, Laura			Impact of the 2018 European heatwave on lake surface water temperature	INLAND WATERS												In 2018, Europe experienced the warmest May-October (Northern Hemisphere warm season) since air temperature records began. In this study, we ran model simulations for 46 557 lakes across Europe to investigate the influence of this heatwave on surface water temperature. We validated the model with satellite-derived lake surface temperatures for 115 lakes from 1995 to 2018. Using the validated model, we demonstrated that, during May-October 2018, mean and maximum lake surface temperatures were 1.5 and 2.4 degrees C warmer than the base-period average (1981-2010). A lake model experiment demonstrated that, on average, the increase in air temperature was the dominant driver of surface water temperature change. However, in some lake regions, other meteorological forcing had a greater influence. Notably, higher than average solar radiation and lower than average wind speed exacerbated the influence of the heatwave on lake surface temperature in many regions, particularly Fennoscandia and Western Europe. To place our results in the context of projected 21st century climate change, we then ran the lake model with input data from state-of-the-art climate model projections under 3 emissions scenarios. Under the scenario with highest emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5), we demonstrated that by the end of the 21st century, the lake surface temperatures that occurred during the heatwave of 2018 will become increasingly common across many lake regions in Europe.

However, the ecological mechanisms regulating long-term variations of bacterioplankton communities in lake ecosystems remain poorly understood. Here we present nearly a decade-long study of bacterioplankton communities from the eutrophic Lake Donghu (Wuhan, China) using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing with MiSeq platform. We found strong repeatable seasonal diversity patterns in terms of both common (detected in more than 50% samples) and dominant (relative abundance >1%) bacterial taxa turnover. Moreover, community composition tracked the seasonal temperature gradient, indicating that temperature is a key environmental factor controlling observed diversity patterns. Total phosphorus also contributed significantly to the seasonal shifts in bacterioplankton composition. However, any spatial pattern of bacterioplankton communities across the main lake areas within season was overwhelmed by their temporal variabilities. Phylogenetic analysis further indicated that 75%-82% of community turnover was governed by homogeneous selection due to consistent environmental conditions within seasons, suggesting that the microbial communities in Lake Donghu are mainly controlled by niche-based processes. Therefore, dominant niches available within seasons might be occupied by similar combinations of bacterial taxa with modest dispersal rates throughout different lake areas.

The New Area is located in the semi-arid North China Plain (NCP) and is home to NCP's largest natural freshwater wetland, Baiyangdian Lake. A comprehensive realization of surface water dynamics would be crucial for policy-makers to outline a sustainable environment development strategy for New Area. In this study, we used a total of 245 time slices of cloud-free Landsat images to document the continuous changes of water bodies within Xiong'an City during 1984-2016 and to provide detailed evidence of water presence and persistency states and changes under the influences of climate change and human actions. Our results reveal that the New Area water body areas varied dramatically during the past 33 years, ranging from 0.44 km(2) in April 1988 to 317.85 km(2) in February 1989. The change of surface water area was not characterized by a monotonically decreasing tendency. The evolution processes can be divided into four sub-stages: the first extreme desiccation in mid-1980s, the wet stage with the most extensive inundation areas and strong inter-annual fluctuations from late-1988 to late 1999, another desiccation stage in early 2000s, and the overall recovering stage between 2007 and 2016. We also mapped the maximum water inundation extents and frequencies of all-season, pre-wet season (February-May) and post-wet season (September-December) for the 33 years and different sub-periods. Although there is good agreement between time series of surface water area evolution in the New Area and station-based precipitation and evaporation variations, multiple lines of evidences reviewed in previous research indicate that the degraded Baiyangdian Lake was also tightly associated with human activities from various aspects, including dam construction, groundwater extraction, agricultural irrigation, etc. We highlighted the current status of exploring the driving mechanism of surface water changes and existing problems, and then offer recommendations.

A new algorithm is proposed and validated to measure algal biomass in Lake Chaohu based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) images. The algal biomass index (ABI) is defined as the difference in remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs, sr(-1)) at 555 nm normalized against two baselines with one formed linearly between R-rs(859) and R-rs(469) and another formed linearly between R-rs(645) and R-rs(469). Both theory and model simulations show that ABI has a good relation with the algal biomass in the euphotic zone (R-2 = 0.88, p < 0.01, N = 50). Field data were further used to estimate the biomass outside the euphotic layer through an empirical algorithm. The ABI algorithm was applied to MODIS Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (R-rc) data after testing the sensitivity to sun glint and thickness of aerosols, which showed an acceptable precision (root mean square error < 21.31 mg and mean relative error < 16.08%). Spectral analyses showed that ABI algorithm was immune to concentration of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) but relatively sensitive to suspended particulate inorganic matter (SPIM), which can be solved by using Turbid Water Index (TWI) though in such a challenging environment. A long-term (2012-2017) estimation of algal biomass was further calculated based on the robust algorithm, which shows both seasonal and spatial variations in Lake Chaohu. Tests of ABI algorithm on Sentinel-3 OLCI demonstrates the potential for application in other remote sensors, which meets the need of observation using multi-sensor remote sensing in the future.

The integration of mull-mission satellite data, hydrological models, and in situ measurements allows for a comprehensive estimate of Lake Poyang's storage variations. We here estimated Lake Poyang water storage changes during the recent decade by using inundation areas mapped from optical satellite imagery and water levels measured by satellite radar altimetry and gauging stations. The amplitudes of seasonal variation from altimetry data are smaller than those from station measurements. This is likely attributed to their low temporal resolutions and limited footprint coverage, together with a complex surface gradient over Lake Poyang. The residual fields between land water storage changes assessed by the GRACE satellites and simulated by two hydrological models (GLDAS Noah and WGHM) were applied to estimate Poyang water storage changes. Leakage errors in the GRACE-model residuals are further corrected by a constrained forward modeling method, resulting in recovered water storage trends -66 times of the uncorrected signals. Water level changes estimated by different methods are then compared. Results show that level changes inverted from recovered storage variations by GRACE-GLDAS and GRACE-WGHM are significantly larger than those from satellite altimetry and in situ measurements. This indicates that the combination of GRACE observation and global hydrological modeling is likely insufficient to estimate accurate water storage changes in Lake Poyang. Our methods and results provide a valuable example of using integrated methods for monitoring water storage changes in highly dynamic fluvial lake systems.					; Zhang, Zizhan/F-5705-2016; Chen, Jianli/KUD-8259-2024; Wang, Jida/AGH-0464-2022; Li, Jin/H-5631-2019	Ni, Shengnan/0000-0003-3690-8144; Chen, Jianli/0000-0001-5405-8441; Li, Jin/0000-0002-6927-0549; Xu, Yuyue/0000-0002-5000-4232; LIU, Yuanbo/0000-0002-8780-927X; Wang, Jida/0000-0003-3548-8918													0022-1694	1879-2707				NOV	2020	590								125229	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125229	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125229													WOS:000599754500031

Based on an extensive review of published literature, current knowledge of floodplain lakes and links between hydrology and ecology are summarized and synthesized. River-lake interactions determine hydrological conditions in floodplain lakes, with high spatial heterogeneity influenced by topography, geophysical properties, and climate. Seasonal fluctuations in water level and hydrological connectivity affect the community structure of aquatic organisms and biogeochemical processes. The interplay of floods and terrain shapes vegetation dynamics. Hydrological regimes sustain the quantity and quality of habitats, along with food resources for waterbirds and other organisms. Although certain species have adaptive capacities to changing hydrology through life history strategies, behavioral modifications, or physiological adjustments, long-term pressures from reservoir construction, intensive land use, and other human activities appear to be inducing cumulative, non-linear impacts that may push these ecosystems towards critical thresholds. Sustained pressures increase the risk of regime shifts, threatening ecosystem functionality. Current research often overlooks the complex interactions and feedbacks within ecosystems, leading to uncertain predictions regarding species resilience and ecosystem function. Existing methods are insufficient for fully integrating both short-term disturbances and long-term pressure. Advancing understanding of species adaptations across different temporal scales remains a priority, highlighting the need for more comprehensive frameworks for biodiversity conservation that effectively account for changing environment. Future efforts should focus on comprehensive in-situ monitoring and observation strategies, jointly with the application of advanced mathematical models, to enhance our understanding of ecology of floodplain lakes.

J	Zhang, LY; Wang, J; Wang, SX; Wang, CB; Yang, FM; Li, TZ				Zhang, Liuyi; Wang, Jia; Wang, Shuxiao; Wang, Chunbo; Yang, Fumo; Li, Tingzhen			Chemical characteristics of long-term acid rain and its impact on lake water chemistry: A case study in Southwest China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												The chemical composition of acid rain and its impact on lake water chemistry in Chongqing, China, from 2000 to 2020 were studied in this study. The regional acid rain intensity is affected jointly by the acid gas emissions and the neutralization of alkaline substances. The pH of precipitation experienced three stages of fluctuating decline, continuous improvement, and a slight correction. Precipitation pH showed inflection points in 2010, mainly due to the total control actions of SO2 and NOx implemented in 2011. The total ion concentrations in rural areas and urban areas were 489.08 peq/L and 618.57 peq/L, respectively. The top four ions were SO42-, Ca2 +, NH4 + and NO3 -, which accounted for more than 90% of the total ion concentration, indicating the anthropogenic effects. Before 2010, SO42-fluctuated greatly while NO3 - continued to rise; however, after 2010, both SO42-and NO3 - began to de-cline rapidly, with the rates of-12.03 peq/(L center dot year) and-4.11 peq/(L center dot year). Because the decline rate of SO42-was 2.91 times that of NO3 -, the regional acid rain has changed from sulfuric acid rain to mixed sulfuric and nitric acid rain. The lake water is weakly acidic, with an average pH of 5.86, and the acidification frequency is 30.00%. Acidification of lake water is jointly affected by acid deposition and acid neutralization capacity of lake water. Acid deposition has a profound impact on water acidification, and nitrogen (N) deposition, especially reduced N deposition, should be the focus of future research.(c) 2023 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

However, indirect N2O emissions from agriculture watershed water surfaces are poorly understood. Here, surface-dissolved N2O concentration in water bodies of the agricultural watershed in Eastern China, one of the most intensive agricultural regions, was measured over a two-year period. Results showed that the dissolved N2O concentrations varied in samples taken from different water types, and the annual mean N2O concentrations for rivers, ponds, reservoir, and ditches were 30 +/- 18, 19 +/- 7, 16 +/- 5 and 58 +/- 69 nmol L-1, respectively. The N2O concentrations can be best predicted by the NO3--N concentrations in rivers and by the NH4+-N concentrations in ponds. Heavy precipitation induced hot moments of riverine N2O emissions were observed during farming season. Upstream waters are hot spots, in which the N2O production rates were two times greater than in non-hotspot locations. The modeled watershed indirect N2O emission rates were comparable to direct emission from fertilized soil. A rough estimate suggests that indirect N2O emissions yield approximately 4% of the total N2O emissions yield from N-fertilizer at the watershed scale. Separate emission factors (EF) established for rivers, ponds, and reservoir were 0.0013, 0.0020, and 0.0012, respectively, indicating that the IPCC (Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change) default value of 0.0025 may overestimate the indirect N2O emission from surface water in eastern China. EF was inversely correlated with N loading, highlighting the potential constraints in the IPCC methodology for water with a high anthropogenic N input. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Mizanur; Yan, Xiaoyuan			Anaerobic ammonium oxidation and denitrification in a paddy soil as affected by temperature, pH, organic carbon, and substrates	BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS												Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox process) widely occurs in paddy soil and may substantially contribute to permanent N removal; however, little is known about the factors controlling this process. Here, effects of temperature, pH, organic C, and substrates on potential rate of anammox and the relative contribution of anammox to total N-2 production in a paddy soil were investigated via slurry incubation combined with N-15 tracer technique. Anammox occurred over a temperature range from 5 to 35 A degrees C with an optimum rate at 25 A degrees C (1.7 nmol N g(-1) h(-1)) and a pH range from 4.8 to 10.1 with an optimum rate at pH 7.3 (1.7 nmol N g(-1) h(-1)). The presence of glucose and acetate (5-100 mg C L-1) significantly inhibited anammox activities and the ratio of anammox to total N-2 production. The response of potential rates of anammox to ammonium concentrations fitted well with Michaelis-Menten relationship showing a maximum rate (V (max)) of 4.4 nmol N g(-1) h(-1) and an affinity constant (K (m)) of 6.3 mg NH4 (+)-N L-1. Whereas, nitrate addition (5-15 mg (NO3)-N-15 (-)-N L-1) significantly inhibited anammox activities and the ratio of anammox to total N-2 production. Our results provide useful information on factors controlling anammox process and its contribution to N loss in the paddy soil.					; Rahman, Mohammad/KHY-3819-2024; Shan, Jun/G-2949-2011	Rahman, M Mizanur/0000-0003-4225-9451; Shan, Jun/0000-0002-0276-4456													0178-2762	1432-0789				APR	2018	54	3					341	348		10.1007/s00374-018-1263-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-018-1263-z													WOS:000427359500004

Alteration to river-lake interactions have great impacts on water and mass balances. Naturally connected to the middle Yangtze River are the Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, which are the largest and the second largest freshwater lakes in China. The operation of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) in the upper Yangtze River was found to have substantial impacts on the middle Yangtze river-lake system. In the past decade, unusual seasonal dryness was evident in the two lakes. Considerable deviations in lake water quality and wetland ecosystem were also detected. In order to explore and distinguish the causal factors influencing the river-lake system, the Ministry of Sciences and Technology (China) launched a research project in 2012, the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) (2012CB417000). This article provides an overview of advances in this research, including the evolution of the river-lake interactions, the impacts of the TGD, and the influences on lake hydrology, water quality, and ecosystem.

This study investigated the distribution and potential environmental behavior of pesticides in river-reservoir system, examining 31 target pesticides in water phase from a key drinking water source (Dongjiang River). The concentrations of Sigma(8)OCPs, Sigma(16)OPPs and Sigma(7)SPs with the corresponding occurrence were in the range of 107.57-340.35 ng/L (moderate level), 232.65-1197.95 ng/L (moderate level) and 125.23-245.09 ng/L (low level), respectively. Ecological risk assessments indicated that most of the pesticides posed a high level of risk to the aquatic organisms. Moreover, seasonal agricultural application, rainfall and temperature could influence the levels and compositions of Sigma(8)OCPs, Sigma(16)OPPs and Sigma(7)SPs in the river system, while seasonal hydrological processes could only influence their compositions in the reservoir system. In the wet season, the levels of Sigma(8)OCPs and Sigma(7)SPs decreased from the river system to reservoir system probably via biogeochemical processes, while the level of Sigma(16)OPPs decreased along the environmental gradient probably via dilution process. Additionally, longer hydraulic retention time of the reservoir system could contribute to the biogeochemical processes for OPPs and SPs exported from the river system, but it might fail to facilitate this process for OCPs. Taken together, this study highlighted that the distributions and environmental behavior of pesticides in river-reservoir system varied seasonally from river system to reservoir system.

To predict flood susceptibility, we employed three artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms: the K-nearest neighbor (KNN), conditional inference random forest (CIRF), and regularized random forest (RRF). Predictions were based on data from 2452 historical flood events, alongside climatic variables measured over monthly, seasonal, and annual timeframes. The innovative aspect of this research is the emphasis on using climatic variables across these progressively condensed timeframes, specifically addressing eight precipitation factors. The performance evaluation, employing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) metric, identified the RRF model as the most accurate, with the highest AUC of 0.94 during the testing phase, followed by the CIRF (AUC = 0.91) and the KNN (AUC = 0.86). An analysis of variable importance highlighted the substantial role of certain climatic factors, namely precipitation in the warmest quarter, annual precipitation, and precipitation during the wettest month, in the modeling of flood susceptibility in South Asia. The resultant flood susceptibility maps demonstrated the influence of climate change scenarios on susceptibility classifications, signalling a dynamic landscape of flood-prone areas over time. The findings revealed variable trends under different climate change scenarios and periods, with marked differences in the percentage of areas classified as having high and very high flood susceptibility. Overall, this study advances our understanding of how climate change affects flood susceptibility in South Asia and offers an essential tool for assessing and managing flood risks in the region.

Impacts of sediment resuspension on phytoplankton biomass production and trophic transfer: Implications for shallow lake restoration	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Wind-induced sediment resuspension in shallow lakes may enhance nutrient availability while reducing light availability for phytoplankton growth, thereby affecting the entire food-web. Lake restoration projects that reduce wind induced resuspension are expected to enhance trophic transfer efficiencies, thereby improving food-web structure and functioning. Yet, reduced resuspension may also lead to lower nutrient concentrations in the water column, promote benthic algae development, reduce phytoplankton biomass production and thereby reduce secondary production by zooplankton. Lake Markermeer is a shallow delta lake in The Netherlands subject to wind-induced sediment resuspension. Restoration project Marker Wadden consists of newly built islands aiming to reduce sediment resuspension and promote higher trophic levels. Here, we tested the effects of reduced sediment resuspension on phytoplankton biomass build-up, benthic algae development, and zooplankton abundances at different temperatures in a 14-day indoor microcosm experiment. We used Marker Wadden sediment with three resuspension intensities combined with three temperatures, to also test effects of higher temperatures in shallow sheltered waters. Reduced sediment resuspension decreased nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton biomass build-up, while increasing light availability and enhancing benthic algae biomass development. Reduced sediment resuspension furthermore increased zooplankton biomass. Enhanced sediment resuspension and higher temperatures synergistically interacted, maintaining a high level of inorganic suspended solids. Our experimental results are in line with long-term seasonal observations from Lake Markermeer. Our findings demonstrate that for shallow lakes suffering from wind effects, measures such as Marker Wadden aimed at reducing sediment resuspension can be effective in restoring secondary production and supporting higher trophic levels.

With unique advantages over the optical sensors (e.g., little effect of clouds, and observations at day and night), Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors provide an important data source for mapping inundation, particularly during flood periods. Freely available SAR images from Sentinel-1 have been increasingly used for many applications. This study applied an efficient transformer-based change detection method, bitemporal image transformer (BiT) with bitemporal Sentniel-1 images, to map inundation extents and evolution in Poyang Lake area in 2020. The transformer-based change detection method firstly adopted ResNet for high-level semantic features extraction, and applied a transformer mechanism to refine these features pixelwise, followed by employing a FCN as the prediction head for generating the results of change detection. Besides, we constructed a water change detection dataset with spatial-and-temporal generalization from bitemporal Sentinel-1 images; this dataset consists of the seasonal variation water samples of Poyang Lake for years. We compared the results from the BiT method with other convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods (STANets and SNUNet). Mapped inundation extents were evaluated with the ground truth visually derived from high spatial resolution images. The evaluation showed the BiT method generated high accurate mapped inundation extents with the F1-score of 95.5%. The BiT model has proven its superior performance in detecting increased water. Based on the results of the BiT method, the variation of inundation extents in Poyang Lake during May-November 2020 was further analyzed. It was found that the water surface coverage of Poyang Lake is the smallest in late May; it gradually increased to the maximum on 14th July, and then began to stabilize and show a significant downward trend before November. The flood distribution map shows that cultivated land has been inundated with the largest area of approximately 600 km2.					duan, zheng/D-6409-2011; Amankwah, Solomon/ABG-3553-2021	Duan, Zheng/0000-0002-4411-8196													0022-1694	1879-2707				MAY	2023	620		A						129455	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129455	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129455		APR 2023											WOS:000970768000001

However, whether TLs change water sources and alleviate water stress for plants is unknown, and previous knowledge about regional TL effects on surrounding vegetation greenness is rare. Here, we synthesized field investigations, stable isotopes, and remote sensing images from an unmanned aerial vehicle and Sentinel-2 to determine the effects of over 160,000 TLs on their surrounding growing-season normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The results are as follows: 1) With the largest water source shifting from 0 to 10 cm soil water to lake water, TL-affected plants can grow better than TL-unaffected plants, which is associated with soil texture and the development stage of the lake. 2) Overall, the median affecting distances of TLs on surrounding surface moisture (tasseled cap wetness, TCW) and NDVI were 50 m with their 25th-75th percentiles of 40-70 m and 40-60 m, respectively; compared with the unaffected areas, TLs increased peripheral TCW but reduced NDVI with their median change rates of 19.84% and -10.42%, respectively. 3) However, the nonlinear response of NDVI to the TCW gradient was dominant, which was featured by a local peak NDVI due to the coexistence of the physical destruction and improved water availability, and both TCW and NDVI at the peak area were explicitly larger than those at the unaffected area. 4) Along southeast-northwest environmental gradients (topographic, climatic, and edaphic factors), the affected range and degradation ratio of NDVI were greater under drier climate, larger lake area, sand-richer soil, fewer soil nutrients, and worse vegetation type (e.g., alpine desert). Briefly, the net adverse consequence on NDVI suggests that TLs primarily represent permafrost-supported ecosystems deteriorating, but the clear nonlinear effects advance the knowledge of this landscape; additionally, these local vegetation changes can help interpret the regional greening/browning and promote the research on the biogeochemical interaction among TL, soil, and plants under climate warming and permafrost thawing.					; Li, Xiaoyan/K-8544-2012; Zhao, Shaojie/AAZ-5143-2021; Deng, yuanhong/HKF-7757-2023; Ding, Mengkai/LWJ-8230-2024; Chai, Linna/LZH-4400-2025	Li, XiaoYan/0000-0002-7454-7821; Chai, Linna/0000-0001-8295-8973; Ding, Mengkai/0009-0007-1044-4122; 													0034-4257	1879-0704				OCT	2022	280								113215	10.1016/j.rse.2022.113215	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2022.113215		AUG 2022											WOS:000844040200002

The Yellow River is one of the largest contributors to the global riverine sediment flux from the land to ocean, and there is a paucity of information on how the optical properties of CDOM have the potential to serve as an indicator of water quality for the sedimentladen Yellow River. In this study, a three-dimensional fluorescence parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis method was applied to investigate the seasonal and spatial variations in CDOM fluorescence components and spectral characteristics from the source region to the estuary in the mainstream of Yellow River. The relationships of CDOM with water quality indicators and trophic state were also analyzed. Six PARAFAC components (C1-C6) were identified and grouped into two categories: humic-like components (C1-C4), which accounted for 85.8 %, and protein-like components (C5 and C6), which accounted for only 14.2 %. The CDOM components, spectral parameters, and their clear correlations with the main ions (Na+ and Cl-) all indicated that the humic-like components may be primarily derived from nonpoint source erosion, and the protein-like components were mainly derived from point source discharges in the watershed. The combination of the CDOM absorption coefficient at 254 nm (a(254)), spectral slope ratio (SR), specific UV absorbance SUVA254, and fluorescence index (FI) had a good predictive ability for the key water quality indicators (total nitrogen (TN), dissolved total nitrogen (DTN), total phosphorus (TP), dissolved total phosphorus (DTP), and chlorophyll a (Chl a)) and trophic state index (TSI). Therefore, some fluorophores and UV spectral parameters of CDOM in the Yellow River can be used for rapid water quality monitoring and pollution source indication, especially pollutants related to nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients in the basin.					; Li, Ming/JPA-5759-2023; Zhu, Qingwei/NVM-0624-2025	Li, Dianbao/0000-0002-5601-4925; 													0269-7491	1873-6424				NOV 15	2021	289								117970	10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117970	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117970		AUG 2021						34426192					WOS:000697048700009
J	Ren, Z; Qu, XD; Zhang, M; Yu, Y; Peng, WQ				Ren, Ze; Qu, Xiaodong; Zhang, Min; Yu, Yang; Peng, Wenqi			Distinct Bacterial Communities in Wet and Dry Seasons During a Seasonal Water Level Fluctuation in the Largest Freshwater Lake (Poyang Lake) in China	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Water level fluctuations (WLFs) are an inherent feature of lake ecosystems and have been regarded as a pervasive pressure on lacustrine ecosystems globally due to anthropogenic activities and climate change. However, the impacts of WLFs on lake microbial communities is one of our knowledge gaps. Here, we used the high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing approach to investigate the taxonomic and functional dynamics of bacterial communities in wet-season and dry-season of Poyang Lake (PYL) in China. The results showed that dry-season was enriched in total nitrogen (TN), nitrate (NO3-), ammonia (NH4+), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), while wet-season was enriched in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total phosphorus (TP). Bacterial communities were distinct taxonomically and functionally in dry-season and wet-season and the nutrients especially P variation had a significant contribution to the seasonal variation of bacterial communities. Moreover, bacterial communities responded differently to nutrient dynamics in different seasons. DOC, NO3-, and SRP had strong influences on bacterial communities in dry-season while only TP in wet-season. Alpha-diversity, functional redundancy, taxonomic dissimilarities, and taxa niche width were higher in dry-season, while functional dissimilarities were higher in wet-season, suggesting that the bacterial communities were more taxonomically sensitive in dry-season while more functionally sensitive in wet-season. Bacterial communities were more efficient in nutrients utilization in wet-season and might have different nitrogen removal mechanisms in different seasons. Bacterial communities in wet-season had significantly higher relative abundance of denitrification genes but lower anammox genes than in dry-season.

J	Wangchuk, S; Bolch, T; Robson, BA				Wangchuk, Sonam; Bolch, Tobias; Robson, Benjamin Aubrey			Monitoring glacial lake outburst flood susceptibility using Sentinel-1 SAR data, Google Earth Engine, and persistent scatterer interferometry	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Continuous monitoring of glacial lakes, their parent glaciers and their surroundings is crucial because possible outbursts of these lakes pose a serious hazard to downstream areas. Ongoing climate change increases the risk of this hazard globally due to recession of glaciers leading to formation and expansion of glacial lakes, and permafrost degradation which impacts the stability of glaciers, slopes and moraines. Here, we demonstrate the capability of our approach for monitoring lake outburst susceptibility using time-series of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (S-1 SAR) data. We selected Lunana in the Bhutanese Himalayas as an example region as it is highly susceptible to glacial lake outburst floods and suitable baseline data were available. We used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to calculate average radar backscatter intensity (ARBI) of glaciers, lakes, basins, and moraines. To determine the periodicity of the highest and the lowest radar backscatter intensity, we denoised the ARBI data using a Fast Fourier Transform and autocorrelated using a Pearson correlation function. Additionally, we determined glacier melt area, basin melt area, lake area, open water area, and lake ice area using radar backscatter intensity data. The Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique was used to investigate the stability of moraines and slopes around glacial lakes. The PSI results were qualitatively validated by comparison with high-resolution digital elevation model differencing results. Our approach showed that glaciers and basins in the region underwent seasonal and periodic changes in their radar backscatter intensity related to changes in ice and snow melt. Lakes also showed seasonal changes in their radar backscatter intensity related to the variation of lake ice and open water area, but the radar backscatter intensity change was not periodic. We could also infer lake area change using a time-series radar backscatter intensity data such as the rapid expansion of Bechung Tsho. The PSI analysis showed that all the terminal moraines were stable except Drukchung Tsho. Its terminal moraine showed subsidence at the rate of -5.18 mm/yr. Sidewalls of lakes were also stable with the exception of Lugge Tsho at site 4. Due to the free availability of S-1 SAR data, the efficiency of processing a large amount of imagery within GEE, and the PSI technique, we were able to understand the outburst susceptibility of glacial lakes in the region at great detail. The regular acquisition of S-1 SAR data enables continuous monitoring of glacial lakes. A similar approach and concept can be transferred to any geographic region on earth that shares similar challenges in glacial lake monitoring.

However, little is known about aquifer vulnerability to hazardous matters especially in previously contaminated site of rapidly urbanizing cities. Here, we collected 90 groundwater samples from Xiong'an New Area during wet and dry seasons of 2019 and characterized the composition and distribution of emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) in this strategically developing city. A total of 89 EOCs, assigned to organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), were detected with the frequencies ranging from 1.11 %-85.6 %. Methyl tert-butyl ether (16.3 & mu;g/L), Epoxid A (6.15 & mu;g/L), and & alpha;-Lindane (5.15 & mu;g/L) could be identified as major contributors to groundwater organic pollution. Significant aggregation of groundwater EOCs along Tang River were found due to historical residue and accumulation from wastewater storage there before 2017. Significant seasonal variations (p < 0.05) in the types and concentrations of EOCs could be attributed to discrepant pollution sources between varying seasons. Human health effects from exposure to groundwater EOCs were further evaluated with negligible risk (<10-4) in most samples (97.8 %) and notable risk (10-6-10-4) in several monitored wells (2.20 %) located along Tanghe Sewage Reservoir. This study provides new evidences for aquifer vulnerability to hazardous matters in historically contaminated sites and is of significant to groundwater pollution controlling and drinking water safety for rapidly urbanizing cities.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				OCT 1	2023	893								164786	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164786	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164786		JUN 2023						37315615					WOS:001032889900001

In an attempt to assess the water quality status of the lake, data acquired from 13 monitoring points in Hulun Lake from 2012 to 2020 was applied to the improved composite water quality identification index (WQI). The ordinary least squares (OLS) model was used to identify areas of the lake vulnerable to water pollution. The results showed an increase in the WQI value of Hulun Lake and the water quality deteriorated during 2012-2016. The water quality began to improve gradually in 2017. The main variable affecting water quality in the lake transitioned from chemical oxygen demand (CODcr) and total nitrogen (TN) to CODcr and total phosphorus(TP). This shift in major pol-lutants was an important factor contributing to deterioration in water quality. Seasonal differences in water quality may be attributed to migration of pollutants [CODcr, total dissolved solids (TDS)] to the subglacial water column during the ice-covered period and the subsequent blocking effect of the ice cap. A spatially based OLS model identified the critical impact of Chl.a on water quality. Water transfers were identified as a major factor contributing to an improvement in water quality and to pollutant transformation and contributed to increase in the water quality sensitive area. Despite recent efforts to improve the water quality of Hulun Lake, input of exogenous pollutants, increase in endogenous pollutants, as well as the anaerobic conditions of the ice layer pose significant challenges to the management of Hulun Lake. The implementation of pollutant control measures are, in particular, recommended on the northwest shore for managing the water quality of the lake.					guohua, li/ABD-4825-2020; Liu, Yu/HNQ-3822-2023; shi, XIAOHONG/KRP-1855-2024														1470-160X	1872-7034				MAY	2023	149								110176	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110176	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110176		MAR 2023											WOS:000966917000001

The study area of this research is Baiyangdian, which is a typical macrophytic lake with complex land cover types. This research aims to solve the low accuracy problem of the remote sensing extraction of SAV, which is mainly caused by water level fluctuations, differences in life-history characteristics, and mixed-pixel phenomena. Here, we developed a phenology-pixel method to determine the spatial distribution of SAV and the start and end dates of its growing season by using all Sentinel-2 images collected over a year on the Google Earth Engine platform. The experimental results show the following: (1) The phenology-pixel algorithm can effectively identify the maximum spatial distribution and growth period of submerged aquatic vegetation in Baiyangdian Lake throughout the year. The unique normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) peak characteristics of Potamogeton crispus from March to May were used to effectively distinguish it from the low Phragmites australis population. Textural features based on the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) index effectively removed the mixed-pixel phenomenon of macrophytic lakes (such as dikes and sparse reeds). (2) A complete five-day interval NDVI time-series dataset was obtained, which removes potential noise on the temporal scale and fills in noisy observations by the harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS) method. We determined the two phenological periods of typical SAV by analyzing the intrayear variation characteristics of NDVI and MNDWI. (3) Using field-survey data for accuracy verification, the overall accuracy of our method was determined to be 94.8%, and the user's accuracy and producer's accuracy were 93.3% and 87.3%, respectively. Determining the temporal and spatial distribution of different SAV populations provides important technical support for actively promoting the maintenance and reconstruction of lake and reservoir ecosystems.						gong, zhaoning/0000-0002-5760-6367														2072-4292				FEB	2022	14	3							640	10.3390/rs14030640	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14030640													WOS:000755144600001

Improving Representation of Tropical Wetland Methane Emissions With CYGNSS Inundation Maps	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Wetlands are the single largest source of methane to the atmosphere and their emissions are expected to respond to a changing climate. Inaccuracy and uncertainty in inundation extent drives differences in modeled wetland emissions and impacts representation of wetland emissions on inter-annual and seasonal time frames. Existing wetland maps are based on optical or NIR satellite data obscured by clouds and vegetation, often leading to underestimates in wetlands extent, especially in the Tropics. Here, we present new inundation maps based on the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) satellite constellation, operating in L-band that is not impacted by clouds or vegetation, providing reliable observations through canopy and cloudy periods. We map the temporal and spatial dynamics of the Pantanal and Sudd wetlands, two of the largest wetlands in the world, using CYGNSS data and a computer vision algorithm. We link these inundation maps to methane fluxes via WetCHARTs, a global wetland methane emissions model ensemble. We contrast CYGNSS-modeled methane emissions with WetCHARTs standard runs that use monthly rainfall data from ECMWF re-analysis (ERA5), as well as the commonly used SWAMPS wetland maps. We find that the CYGNSS-based inundation maps modify the methane emissions in multiple ways. The seasonality of inundation and methane emissions is shifted by two months because of the lag in wetland recharge following peak rainfall. Both inundation and methane emissions also respond non-linearly to wet-season precipitation totals, leading to large interannual variability in emissions. Finally, the annual magnitude of emissions is found to be greater than previously estimated.

Fish in deep water bodies occupy different habitats, so a combination of survey methods has traditionally been used. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is a novel monitoring tool that can overcome spatial heterogeneity in a highly sensitive and entirely non-invasive manner. However, taxon detection probability is dependent on environmental variables. In this study, three reservoirs were sampled in two seasons using a spatiotemporally distributed sampling design covering major environmental gradients. In all sampling campaigns, 31 fish taxa were detected. Data reliability was supported by tight positive correlations between individual taxon scores derived from gillnet sampling and eDNA site occupancy. Analyses confirmed anticipated trends, such as the highest number of taxa in the largest water body, and more taxa in inflows and littoral regions compared to open water. The most important factors for fish distribution were temperature, water age and trophic status (expressed as total Chlorophyll a concentration) of water bodies. Taxon detection reflected ecological niches of individual species, e.g. warm water wels catfish (Silurus glanis) and cold water salmonids. This study provides further evidence that eDNA metabarcoding is a suitable alternative or complement to conventional fish sampling in reservoirs.					; Juza, Tomas/G-3159-2014; Sajdlova, Zuzana/R-1383-2018; Blabolil, Petr/K-9548-2015; Rychtecky, Pavel/B-5621-2008; Harper, Lynsey/AAQ-2705-2020; Di Muri, Cristina/GSN-8197-2022; Znachor, Petr/F-8901-2014; Hejzlar, Josef/F-8526-2014; Vasek, Mojmir/C-5839-2014; Peterka, Jiří/C-7218-2014	Blabolil, Petr/0000-0003-1344-9627; S Sellers, Graham/0000-0002-9679-0435; Di Muri, Cristina/0000-0003-4072-0662; Ricanova, Stepanka/0000-0001-9048-7868; Peterka, Jiri/0000-0001-5935-4311; Rychtecky, Pavel/0000-0001-8743-9152; Vasek, Mojmir/0000-0001-6386-4015; Harper, Lynsey/0000-0003-0923-1801													1470-160X	1872-7034				JUL	2021	126								107698	10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107698	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107698		APR 2021											WOS:000647802700003

Hydrodynamics plays a crucial role in algae growth. The recent numerical models of hydrodynamics and water quality are effective to identify the effects of hydrodynamics on phytoplankton and find potential strategies for controlling algal blooms. In this study, the CE-QUAL-W2 model was applied to simulate the hydrodynamics and algal blooms in the Xiangxi Bay (XXB) of the Three Gorges Reservoir. The model performed well in simulating flow patterns, water temperature profile, and algal blooms. The results indicated that the hydrodynamics showed the spatial and temporal differences in the XXB. In the mouth area, the intensity and plunge depth of density currents were dynamic and characterized by a typical seasonal pattern. The transformation of density currents from interflow to overflow will provide more opportunities for vertical mixing, resulting in un-stratification and reducing of algal blooms. However, in the middle and upper areas, strong stratification and low velocity at upstream provide enough favorable conditions for the growth of algae and increase algal blooms. The simulation results revealed that the variation of mixing depth explains the spatial and temporal differences of Chl.a. It played a vital role in seasonal stratification and the dynamics of phytoplankton succession in XXB.

To our knowledge, prior to this work, there was no evidence of the potential presence of antibiotics in groundwater in China, despite populous speculations. This study reported the detection of 35 target antibiotics of 6 groups (chloramphenicois, lincosamides, marcrolides, quinolones, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines), in shallow groundwater samples collected in northern and southwestern China. Thirty-four of thirty-five target antibiotics were detected in the groundwater samples; 73 of 74 monitoring wells contained at least one antibiotic; and at least two antibiotics were detected in 72 of the 74 wells. Ofloxacin (1199.7 ng/L), lincomycin (860.7 ng/L), and norfloxacin (441.9 ng/L) as well as antibiotics with the highest detection frequency such as sulfapyridine (70%), norfloxacin (69%), and lincomycin (64%) were detected at elevated concentrations. The highest detection frequency and concentration of lincosamides were observed in those groundwater samples, but no clear distribution patterns were observed for the six antibiotic groups. Moreover, shallow groundwater in southwestern China seemed to contain most antibiotics, likely due to the high antibiotics discharge and frequent exchange of groundwater with surface matrices. The findings from this work suggest that groundwater in China has been widely contaminated by antibiotics, and presumably other pharmaceutical compounds that have not been investigated to date.

J	Guo, H; Hu, Q; Zhang, Q; Feng, S				Guo, Hua; Hu, Qi; Zhang, Qi; Feng, Song			Effects of the Three Gorges Dam on Yangtze River flow and river interaction with Poyang Lake, China: 2003-2008	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The Three Gorges Dam (TGD) has been in operation since 2003. Over the operation period from 2003-2008, data have been collected for preliminary evaluations of actual effects of the TGD on the Yangtze River flow and river interactions with downstream lakes and tributaries. These effects are examined in this study, after the climate influence was minimized by comparing hydrological changes between years of similar climate conditions before and after the operation of the TGD. Major results show that the TGD operation has affected the Yangtze River discharge and water level. The significance of these effects varies seasonally and with different locations along the river. The seasonal variation follows the TGD's seasonal impounding and releasing of water. The magnitude of the effects is dependent on the impounding/releasing rate and the seasonal flow of the river. The most significant effects are confined in the river reach near the TGD and are as great as five times those of sections downstream. The weakening and diminishing of effect of the TGD is primarily because of "dilutions" to the effect by inflows to the Yangtze River from downstream tributaries. Changes in the Yangtze River discharge caused by the TGD have further altered the interrelationship between the river and Poyang Lake, disturbing the lake basin hydrological processes and water resources. A major consequence of such changes has been a weakening in the river forcing on the lake, allowing more lake flow to the river from July-March. This effect of the TGD may partially fulfill the TGD's mission to mitigate flood risks in the lake basin, especially during the peak wet season of the Yangtze River basin from July-September. In the 6 years since the TGD operation began the annual average number of severe outflow events of rates of >= 3000 m(3) s(-1) from the lake in July-September has increased by 74. It has also resulted in reduction of water storage in Poyang Lake. Results of this study point to strong needs for working strategies to balance the TGD impacts on flood control and water resources as well as their societal and ecological consequences in the Poyang Lake basin. Meanwhile, in the context of studies of impacts of large dams this study shows an example of extending the previous studies in the dam-river setting to a new dam-river-lake construct.

J	Li, YL; Zhang, Q; Tan, ZQ; Yao, J				Li, Yunliang; Zhang, Qi; Tan, Zhiqiang; Yao, Jing			On the hydrodynamic behavior of floodplain vegetation in a flood-pulse-influenced river-lake system (Poyang Lake, China)	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The present study uses a 2D floodplain hydrodynamic model in combination with hypothetical scenarios to investigate the coupled effects (or maximum contribution) of floodplain vegetation on the hydrodynamic behaviors of Poyang Lake (China), a flood-pulse-influenced river-lake system. Model simulations reveal that the influences of the floodplain vegetation on lake water levels, flow velocities and outflow discharges were stronger during the rising and receding water phases than during the flooding phase, indicating the interactions between vegetation and hydrology that vary with the floodplain seasonally. The addition of floodplain vegetation affects conveyance efficiency of the system, decreasing flow velocities by 0.2 m/s, increasing water levels by 0.3 m and associated storage volume of the lake by up to similar to 5%. The distributed effect of floodplain vegetation on the flow velocities shows more complex and sensitive responses than the water levels across the lake-floodplains, demonstrating a strong linkage between the vegetation structure of the floodplain and the velocity distribution. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the transition between different vegetation cover types cannot produce significant influences on the hydrodynamic behaviors, relative to the coupled effects of floodplain vegetation. This study provides important knowledge regarding the role of floodplain vegetation changes to decision-makers for both Poyang Lake and other similar flood pulse systems, given proposals to cope with the flood risk and the accelerating pace of human interventions.					; ZHANG, Qi/MFJ-8647-2025	Li, Yunliang/0000-0002-0708-9138; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				JUN	2020	585								124852	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124852	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124852													WOS:000544230000090

The decline in water quality and the occurrence of massive algal blooms pose a significant threat to the health and environmental safety of the water ecosystem, making Lake Dianchi a key concern for algal bloom management in China. Obtaining the spatiotemporal dynamics of algal blooms for the longest time possible is crucial to algal bloom management and future prediction. However, it is difficult to acquire a long-term record of algal blooms from a single sensor in order to cover a more extended period of eutrophication in the lake due to the limitation of the spatial and temporal resolution of the sensors. In this study, Landsat and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images were combined with the Floating Algae Index (FAI) to reconstruct a unified time series of bloom areas to analyze the algal bloom dynamics in Lake Dianchi in recent decades. Regarding the interannual variation, the bloom area showed an increasing trend from 1987 to 2021, with larger bloom areas in 1991-1992, 2000-2003, 2012-2013, and 2020-2021. In terms of seasonal characteristics, the bloom area was significantly more prominent in the rainy season compared with the dry season during the year. The spatial distribution of the bloom frequency showed a pattern of higher frequencies in the north and lower frequencies in the south. From 2000 to 2021, the initial bloom time and bloom duration showed a trend of delaying and then advancing and decreasing and then increasing, respectively. We analyzed the importance of long-term records of algal blooms and found that the percentage of rainy season images is an essential factor in reconstructing time series based on different sensors. In addition, the relationship between environmental factors and algal blooms was analyzed. The results show that wind speed and air temperature were the main meteorological factors controlling the interannual variation in algal blooms in Lake Dianchi. Water quality factors such as nutrients have less of an influence on the variation in algal blooms because the algal growth demand has been met. Environmental management measures taken by local governments have led to improvements in the lake's trophic state, and continued strengthening of environmental pollution control is expected to curb the algal blooms in Lake Dianchi. This study provides a long-term record of algal blooms in Lake Dianchi, which provides essential reference information for a comprehensive understanding of the development process of algal blooms in Lake Dianchi and its sustainable development.					; Duan, Hongtao/B-7210-2011; Cao, Zhigang/L-5337-2017; Luo, Juhua/AHE-4173-2022; Cao, Zhigang/L-5336-2017; Ma, Jinge/GOG-9613-2022; Qi, Tianci/IRZ-2645-2023	Luo, Juhua/0000-0002-4615-6006; Ma, Jinge/0000-0002-3803-6258; Duan, Hongtao/0000-0002-1985-2292; Cao, Zhigang/0000-0001-5329-2906; 														2072-4292				AUG	2022	14	16							4000	10.3390/rs14164000	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14164000													WOS:000845498000001

Different types of flood have varying consequences and are followed by a specific pattern. For example, a flash flood can be a result of snow or ice melt and can occur in specific geographic places and certain season. The motivation behind this research has been raised from the Building Resilience into Risk Management (BRIM) project, looking at resilience in water systems. This research uses the application of the state-of-the-art techniques i.e., AI, more specifically Machin Learning (ML) approaches on big data, collected from previous flood events to learn from the past to extract patterns and information and understand flood behaviours in order to improve resilience, prevent damage, and save lives. In this paper, various ML models have been developed and evaluated for classifying floods, i.e., flash flood, lakeshore flood, etc. using current information i.e., weather forecast in different locations. The analytical results show that the Random Forest technique provides the highest accuracy of classification, followed by J48 decision tree and Lazy methods. The classification results can lead to better decision-making on what measures can be taken for prevention and preparedness and thus improve flood resilience.					; Joannou, Demetrios/MVY-1930-2025; Fu, Guangtao/ABE-3874-2021; Rivas Casado, Monica/N-4711-2015	Joannou, Demetrios/0000-0002-1153-5989; Kalawsky, Roy/0000-0002-9023-8295; Saravi, Sara/0000-0003-2226-0199; Rivas Casado, Monica/0000-0002-4169-3099														2073-4441				MAY	2019	11	5							973	10.3390/w11050973	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11050973													WOS:000472680400103

An empirical algorithm to map perennial firn aquifers and ice slabs within the Greenland Ice Sheet using satellite L-band microwave radiometry	CRYOSPHERE												Perennial firn aquifers are subsurface meltwater reservoirs consisting of a meters-thick water-saturated firn layer that can form on spatial scales as large as tens of kilometers. They have been observed within the percolation facies of glaciated regions experiencing intense seasonal surface melting and high snow accumulation. Widespread perennial firn aquifers have been identified within the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) via field expeditions, airborne icepenetrating radar surveys, and satellite microwave sensors. In contrast, ice slabs are nearly continuous ice layers that can also form on spatial scales as large as tens of kilometers as a result of surface and subsurface water-saturated snow and firn layers sequentially refreezing following multiple melting seasons. They have been observed within the percolation facies of glaciated regions experiencing intense seasonal surface melting but in areas where snow accumulation is at least 25% lower as compared to perennial firn aquifer areas. Widespread ice slabs have recently been identified within the GrIS via field expeditions and airborne ice-penetrating radar surveys, specifically in areas where perennial firn aquifers typically do not form. However, ice slabs have yet to be identified from space. Together, these two ice sheet features represent distinct, but related, sub-facies within the broader percolation facies of the GrIS that can be defined primarily by differences in snow accumulation, which influences the englacial hydrology and thermal characteristics of firn layers at depth. Here, for the first time, we use enhanced-resolution vertically polarized L-band brightness temperature (T-V(B)) imagery (2015-2019) generated using observations collected over the GrIS by NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite to map perennial firn aquifer and ice slab areas together as a continuous englacial hydrological system. We use an empirical algorithm previously developed to map the extent of Greenland's perennial firn aquifers via fitting exponentially decreasing temporal L-band signatures to a set of sigmoidal curves. This algorithm is recalibrated to also map the extent of ice slab areas using airborne ice-penetrating radar surveys collected by NASA's Operation IceBridge (OIB) campaigns (2010-2017). Our SMAPderived maps show that between 2015 and 2019, perennial firn aquifer areas extended over 64 000 km(2), and ice slab areas extended over 76 000 km(2). Combined together, these sub-facies are the equivalent of 24% of the percolation facies of the GrIS. As Greenland's climate continues to warm, seasonal surface melting will increase in extent, intensity, and duration. Quantifying the possible rapid expansion of these sub-facies using satellite L-band microwave radiometry has significant implications for understanding ice-sheet-wide variability in englacial hydrology that may drive meltwaterinduced hydrofracturing and accelerated ice flow as well as high-elevation meltwater runoff that can impact the mass balance and stability of the GrIS.					; Brodzik, Mary/E-3191-2016; Long, David/K-4908-2015	Miller, Julie Z./0000-0003-1452-1627; Long, David/0000-0002-1852-3972; Culberg, Riley/0000-0002-4460-2359; Schroeder, Dustin/0000-0003-1916-3929													1994-0416	1994-0424				JAN 13	2022	16	1					103	125		10.5194/tc-16-103-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-103-2022													WOS:000746452400001

Much of the current understanding of P dynamics in agricultural systems has been obtained from rainfall-driven runoff, and less is known about cold-season processes. An improved understanding of the magnitude, form, and transport flow paths of P losses from agricultural croplands year round, and the climatic drivers of these processes, is needed to prioritize and evaluate appropriate best management practices (BMPs) to protect soil-water quality in cold regions. This study examines multiyear, year-round, high-frequency edge-of-field P losses (soluble reactive P and total P [TP]) in overland flow and tile drainage from three croplands in southern Ontario, Canada. Annual and seasonal budgets for water, P, and estimates of field P budgets (including fertilizer inputs, crop uptake, and runoff) were calculated for each site. Annual edge-of-field TP loads ranged from 0.18 to 1.93 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) (mean = 0.59 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) across the region, including years with fertilizer application. Tile drainage dominated runoff across sites, whereas the contribution of tiles and overland flow to P loss differed regionally, likely related to site-specific topography, soil type, and microclimate. The nongrowing season was the dominant period for runoff and P loss across sites, where TP loss during this period was often associated with overland flow during snowmelt. These results indicate that emphasis should be placed on BMPs that are effective during both the growing and nongrowing season in cold regions, but that the suitability of various BMPs may vary for different sites.

Atmospheric deposition of phosphorus to land and freshwater	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												We compiled published and newly-obtained data on the directly-measured atmospheric deposition of total phosphorus (TP), filtered total phosphorus (FTP), and inorganic phosphorus (PO4-P) to open land, lakes, and marine coasts. The resulting global data base includes data for c. 250 sites, covering the period 1954 to 2012. Most (82%) of the measurement locations are in Europe and North America, with 44 in Africa, Asia, Oceania, and South-Central America. The deposition rates are log-normally distributed, and for the whole data set the geometric mean deposition rates are 0.027, 0.019 and 0.14 g m(-2) a(-1) for TP, FTP and PO4-P respectively. At smaller scales there is little systematic spatial variation, except for high deposition rates at some sites in Germany, likely due to local agricultural sources. In cases for which PO4-P was determined as well as one of the other forms of P, strong parallels between logarithmic values were found. Based on the directly-measured deposition rates to land, and published estimates of P deposition to the oceans, we estimate a total annual transfer of P to and from the atmosphere of 3.7 Tg. However, much of the phosphorus in larger particles (principally primary biological aerosol particles) is probably redeposited near to its origin, so that long-range transport, important for tropical forests, large areas of peatland and the oceans, mainly involves fine dust from deserts and soils, as described by the simulations of Mahowald et al. (Global Biogeochemical Cycles 22, GB4026, 2008). We suggest that local release to the atmosphere and subsequent deposition bring about a pseudo-diffusive redistribution of P in the landscape, with P-poor ecosystems, for example ombrotrophic peatlands and oligotrophic lakes, gaining at the expense of P-rich ones. Simple calculations suggest that atmospheric transport could bring about significant local redistribution of P among terrestrial ecosystems. Although most atmospherically transported P is natural in origin, local transfers from fertilised farmland to P-poor ecosystems may be significant, and this requires further research.

A synthesis of the diversity of freshwater fish migrations in the Amazon basin	FISH AND FISHERIES												In the Amazon, the world's largest river basin, migrations within freshwater habitats are one of the predominant life history strategies for fishes. The flood pulse and the extensive river network provide aquatic organisms with temporal and spatial accessibility to a mosaic of freshwater habitats. Although migratory fish species are central to freshwater ecosystems and fisheries, the knowledge of species and migratory patterns has traditionally relied on anecdotal and scattered information, lacking a unifying methodological and conceptual framework. We quantitatively synthesize the evidence about this biological phenomenom in the Amazon basin through a systematic literature review. We constructed a reference database of migratory events in the Amazon basin, including species, life stages, purposes, direction, habitats and subbasins. We found that 223 species were documented in 90 references as performing migrations distributed across eight orders and 31 families. Migration is a conserved trait in the evolutionary history of Amazonian fish fauna, suggesting that similar to 41% of migratory species are likely unreported. We noted a geographical bias in the report of migratory events towards 13 of the 27 major subbasins of the Amazon. We found a significant association between the hydrological timing at the beginning and end of migrations across species, including reproduction as the most commonly reported purpose. However, most species lack the application of robust methods (e.g. telemetry, otolith microchemistry) to classify them as migratory, relying upon secondary sources of information (i.e. reviews or species checklists). Further, we discuss future opportunities and challenges to continue the study of fish migrations in the Amazon basin.					; Rodrigues da Costa Doria, Carolina/OEO-0724-2025; Couto, Thiago/N-3256-2013; Duponchelle, Fabrice/K-1998-2016	Victoria-Lacy, LuLu/0000-0002-9731-9215; Couto, Thiago/0000-0002-2485-4970; Herrera-R, Guido A/0000-0001-5686-6362													1467-2960	1467-2979				JAN	2024	25	1					114	133		10.1111/faf.12795	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/faf.12795		NOV 2023											WOS:001107853800001

Dongting Lake is the second largest fresh lake in China which is connected to Yangtze River and has quite prominent ecological status and function within Yangtze River basin. However, the effect of groundwater discharge on the balance of water and contaminant in Dongting Lake has long been overlooked. This study estimated the groundwater discharge and associated contaminants input into Dongting Lake during the dry season using multiple tracers (Rn-222,O-18, Cl-). After sensitivity analysis of different models, it is found that the result of(222)Rn mass balance model is the most reliable. Based on the(222)Rn mass balance model, the groundwater discharge rate is estimated to be 73.94 mm/d and the contribution of LGD to water balance is 10.94%. As the main nutrient components, NH3-N, P and Si from groundwater input account for 23.65%, 5.12% and 30.15% % of the total input, respectively. As the main heavy metal components, Fe, Mn and As from groundwater input all account for more than 50% of the total input. Although the LGD rate is relatively small, the contaminant input from LGD is significant enough, which may be a potential threat to the ecological stability of Dongting Lake. In this study, the mass balance models of multiple tracers were integrated to understand the role of groundwater in maintaining the water balance and pollution status of Dongting Lake, which has certain reference significance for the LGD study in plain lakes or reservoirs with complex water systems in humid regions.

Mastering the spatiotemporal distribution of CCOD is imperative for understanding the variation mechanism and controlling of organic pollution in water. In this study, a hybrid approach suitable for Sentinel 3A/ Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) data was developed to estimate CCOD in inland optically complex waters embedding the interaction between CCOD and the absorption coefficients of optically active constituents (OACs). Based on in-situ sampling in different waters, the independent validations of the proposed model performed satisfac-torily in Lake Taihu (MAPE = 23.52 %, RMSE = 0.95 mg/L, and R2 = 0.81), Lake Qiandaohu (MAPE = 21.63 %, RMSE = 0.50 mg/L and R2 = 0.69), and Yangtze River (MAPE = 29.34 %, RMSE = 0.83 mg/L, and R2 = 0.64). In addition, the approach not only showed significant superiority compared with previous algorithms, but also was suitable for other common satellite sensors equipped same or similar bands. The hybrid approach was applied to OLCI images to retrieve CCOD of Lake Taihu from 2016 to 2020 and reveals substantial interannual and seasonal var-iations. The above results indicate that the proposed approach is effective and stable for studying spatiotemporal dy-namic of CCOD in optically complex waters, and that satellite-derived products can provide reliable information for lake water quality management.

J	Fathian, F; Morid, S; Kahya, E				Fathian, Farshad; Morid, Saeed; Kahya, Ercan			Identification of trends in hydrological and climatic variables in Urmia Lake basin, Iran	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												The drawdown trend of the water level in Urmia Lake poses a serious problem for northwestern Iran which has had negative impacts on agriculture and industry. This research investigated likely causes of the predicament by estimating trends in the time series of hydroclimatic variables of the basin. Three non-parametric statistical tests, the Mann-Kendall, Spearman rho, and Sen's T, were applied to estimate the trends in the annual and seasonal time series of temperature, precipitation, and streamflow at 95 stations throughout the basin. The Theil-Sen method was also used to estimate the slopes of trend lines of annual time series. The results showed a significant increasing trend of temperature throughout the basin and an area-specific precipitation trend. The tests also confirmed a general decreasing trend in the basin streamflow that was more pronounced in the downstream stations. The annual trend line slope was found to be from 0.02 to 0.14 A degrees C/year, -7.5 to 3.8 mm/year, and -0.01 to -0.4 m(3)/s/year for temperature, precipitation, and streamflow, respectively. The homogeneity of the monthly trends was also evaluated using the Van Belle and Hughes tests as confirmation. Temporal analyses of the trends for the temperature and streamflow of the basin detected significant increasing trends beginning in the mid-1980s and 1990s. The correlations between streamflow and climate variables (temperature and precipitation) were detected by Pearson's test. The results showed that the streamflow in Urmia Lake basin is more sensitive to changes in temperature than precipitation. In general, the decline in the lake water level can be related to both the increase of temperature in the basin and an improvement in over-exploitation of the water resources.

J	Posch, T; Köster, O; Salcher, MM; Pernthaler, J				Posch, Thomas; Koester, Oliver; Salcher, Michaela M.; Pernthaler, Jakob			Harmful filamentous cyanobacteria favoured by reduced water turnover with lake warming	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE												Anthropogenic-induced changes in nutrient ratios have increased the susceptibility of large temperate lakes to several effects of rising air temperatures and the resulting heating of water bodies(1). First, warming leads to stronger "thermal stratification, thus impeding natural complete water turnover (holomixis), which compensates for oxygen deficits in the deep zones(2,3). Second, increased water temperatures and nutrient concentrations can directly favour the growth of harmful algae(4-6). Thus, lake-restoration programmes have focused on reducing nutrients to limit toxic algal blooms(7). Here we present evidence that the ubiquitous(8-10) harmful cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens has become the dominant species in a large lake during the past four decades, although the phosphorus content of the ecosystem decreased fivefold. However, the nitrogen input was not diminished concomitantly, favouring this non-N-2-fixing cyanobacterium owing to increased N:P ratios(10). P. rubescens contains gas vesicles that allow for buoyancy to accumulate within the depth of optimal irradiance(11). As the toxic cyanobacterium has low consumption by predators(12), water turnover represents the main mechanism of seasonal population control. Thus, unidirectional lake-restoration measures(13) in parallel with recurrent absence of holomixis owing to lake warming may lead to similar undesired effects that have formerly emerged from fertilization.

Water-lifting aerators (WLAs) were deployed in the Jinpen Reservoir to control these issues with Fe and Mn at the source via bottom aeration and artificial destratification. In this study, variations of Fe and Mn concentrations in the water column, porewater, and sediments, were used to characterize behaviors of reduced Fe and Mn under the conditions of hypolimnetic aeration and artificial destratification during periods of hypolimnion hypoxia and rainfall events. The results showed that replenishing aquatic oxygen levels by aeration can effectively decrease the dissolved Fe and Mn in the water column thereby increasing the sedimentation rate and the diffusive flux of Fe and Mn at the sediment-water interface (SWI). The dissolved Fe was significantly chemically oxidized and the concentration remained relatively low in the water column during WLA operations, while dissolved Mn persistently accumulated in the near-sediment regions because of its complex kinetics. Our in situ profiles of labile Fe and Mn in the sediments demonstrated that the diffusive flux of Mn (J(Mn)) was largely increased by the increased concentration gradient at the SWI, while the diffusive flux of Fe (J(Fe)) decreased. The sediments were observed to rapidly become anoxic and release Fe and Mn after WLA deactivation; this emphasized the importance of appropriate operations linking the artificial and natural mixing periods to prevent SWI hypoxia and the release of reduced substances.

Meanwhile, reconstructions and simulations show inconsistent spatial patterns of terrestrial temperature changes. Here we report Holocene alkenone records to address spatial patterns over mid-latitude Eurasia. In contrast with long-term cooling trends in warm season temperatures in northeastern China, records from southwestern Siberia are characterized by colder conditions before similar to 6,000 years ago, thus long-term warming trends. Together with existing records from surrounding regions, we infer that colder airmassmight have prevailed in the interior of mid-latitude Eurasian continent during the early to mid-Holocene, perhaps associated with atmospheric response to remnant ice sheets. Our results challenge the proposed seasonality bias in proxies and modeled spatial patterns in study region, highlighting that spatial patterns of Holocene temperature changes should be reconsidered in record integrations and model simulations, with important implications for terrestrial hydroclimate changes.

The water, sediment, and fish samples (Labeo rohita and Labeo bata) were collected and analyzed to assess the metal toxicity. In the sediment, geoaccumulation index (I-geo), contamination factor (CF), pollution load index (PLI), and ecological risk index (ERI) were calculated. The estimated daily dietary intake (EDI) for As, Cd, Cr, Mn, Pb, and Zn was estimated in adult and children on the basis an average amount of fish consumed by the Indian people and its associated health hazard with was also assessed in terms of target hazard quotients (THQs). The concentration of metals in all the analyzed samples was found higher during pre-monsoon season. While, in case of fish, L. bata species has higher metal accumulation rate during both the seasons than the L. rohita because of their bottom dweller feeding habit. The order of metals in L. bata muscles is Zn > Mn > Pb > Cr > As > Cd. The I-geo value for Zn (2.66 to 3.68) was found to be highest and followed by Cd (1.65 to 3.52) and Pb (1.52 to 2.55) indicating moderate to highly polluted sediment quality. The values of ERI were significantly high during pre-monsoon period and varied from 319 to 557, representing very high metal contamination. From the human health perspective, present study highlighted that the local inhabitants who rely on this valuable pond for fish consumption are exposed chronically to As and Pb pollution due to higher THQ values, especially from the intake of L. bata.

Anthropogenic eutrophication of Lake Titicaca (Bolivia) revealed by carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes fingerprinting	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Cultural eutrophication is the leading cause of water quality degradation worldwide. The traditional monitoring of eutrophication is time-consuming and not integrative in space and time. Here, we examined the use of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopic composition to track the degree of eutrophication in a bay of Lake Titicaca impacted by anthropogenic (urban, industrial and agricultural wastewater) discharges. Our results show increasing delta C-13 and decreasing delta N-15 signatures in macrophytes and suspended particulate matter with distance to the wastewater source. In contrast to delta N-15 and delta C-13 signatures, in-between aquatic plants distributed along the slope were not only affected by anthropogenic discharges but also by the pathway of carbon uptake, i.e., atmospheric (emerged) vs aquatic (submerged). A binary mixing model elaborated from pristine and anthropogenic isotope end-members allowed the assessment of anthropogenically derived C and N incorporation in macrophytes with distance to the source. Higher anthropogenic contribution was observed during the wet season, attributed to enhanced wastewater discharges and leaching of agricultural areas. For both seasons, eutrophication was however found naturally attenuated within 6 to 8 km from the wastewater source. Here, we confirm that carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes are simple, integrative and time-saving tools to evaluate the degree of eutrophication (seasonally or annually) in anthropogenically impacted aquatic ecosystems.

Specifically, NO3 pollution has critically threatened groundwater quality, thus increasing human health risk if groundwater serves as a drinking source. To identify the origin and fate of NO3 in a plateau lake basin, we utilized nitrate isotope natural abundance and water chemistry information under land use frameworks and groundwater flow information. In December 2018, we collected water samples from aquifers (n = 33), rivers (n = 2), soil (n = 7), and lakes (n = 4) in Chenghai Lake basin, Southwest China. Our results showed that nearly 41% of groundwater samples failed to meet the drinking water standard of WHO and China (GBIT 5749-2006) of 50 mg/L for NO3 during the dry season. The high variation of delta N-15-NO3 (from -3.3 to +41.3%0) and delta O-18-NO3 (from -6.4 to +13.6 parts per thousand) indicated multiple N sources and N cycling processes. Our analysis revealed that 16%-80% of nitrate in groundwater was derived from accumulated soil N, whereas 13%-76% was contributed from manure/landfill leachate. The contribution from atmospheric nitrogen deposition to aquifers was less than 3%. Manure/landfill and soil nitrogen were the primary N sources, contributing for 38.9% and 35.3% to N loading in lake. As for river water, soil nitrogen contributed for 69.7% and 37.2% in R1 and R2, respectively. The denitrification process significantly affects nitrate attenuation of N sources in aquifers. An increasing trend in NO3 concentration was noticed along the groundwater flow path (A-A') from mountain area to lake. Among different pathways, distinct nitrate sources loading downwards to the aquifers were observed in massive farmlands and residential areas. Thus, the information on both land-use and groundwater flow pathways is indispensable for modelling nitrate sources and transformation processes using the dual isotope approach.

Transience of the North American High Plains landscape and its impact on surface water	NATURE												Ecosystem diversity and human activity in dry climates depend not just on the magnitude of rainfall, but also on the landscape's ability to retain water. This is illustrated dramatically in the High Plains of North America, where despite the semi-arid modern and past climate, the hydrologic conditions are diverse. Large rivers sourced in the Rocky Mountains cut through elevated plains that exhibit limited river drainage but widespread surface water in the form of ephemeral (seasonal) playa lakes(1), as well as extensive groundwater hosted in the High Plains aquifer of the Ogallala formations(2). Here we present a model, with supporting evidence, which shows that the High Plains landscape is currently in a transient state, in which the landscape has bifurcated into an older region with an inefficient river network and a younger, more efficient, river channel network that is progressively cannibalizing the older region. The older landscape represents the remnants of the Ogallala sediments that once covered the entirety of the High Plains, forming depositional fans that buried the pre-existing river network and effectively ` repaved' the High Plains(3-6). Today we are witnessing the establishment of a new river network that is dissecting the landscape, capturing channels and eroding these sediment fans. Through quantitative analysis of the geometry of the river network, we show how network reorganization has resulted in a distinctive pattern of erosion, whereby the largest rivers have incised the older surface, removed fan heads near the Rocky Mountains and eroded the fan toes, but left portions of the central fan surface and the Ogallala sediments largely intact. These preserved fan surfaces have poor surface water drainage, and thus retain ephemeral water for wetlands and groundwater recharge. Our findings suggest that the surface hydrology and associated ecosystems are transient features on million-year timescales, and reflect the mode of landscape evolution.

However, in recent years, Poyang Lake has approached desiccation multiple times, with severe droughts becoming increasingly common. Consequently, precise quantification and analysis of the terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) and drought characteristics of the Poyang Lake basin (PLB) are of profound scientific and practical significance. This paper, for the first time, utilizes data for the period 2021-2022 from 77 newly-established GNSS observation stations in the PLB to precisely determine its vertical crustal displacement, invert daily and monthly TWSA, and investigate extreme hydrological drought. The results reveal the following: 1) The annual amplitude range of vertical surface displacements at GNSS stations in the Poyang Lake basin is from 7 to 14 mm, with the most substantial seasonal vertical displacements occurring during the months of June and July; 2) monthly GNSS-TWSA maintains a commendable consistency with TWSA data obtained from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), and precipitation, with correlation coefficients of 0.67, 0.55, and 0.62, respectively; 3) at daily scale, the GNSS-derived Drought Severity Index (GNSS-DSI) accurately recorded the severity and intensity of eight drought events in the PLB during 2021-2022, in particular the period of extensive drought between October 2021 and February 2022, when drought intensity reaching a notable 1.03, which is classified as an extreme and prolonged drought event. Additionally, at local temporal scales, daily GNSS-DSI exhibits heightened sensitivity to drought signals. This study provides novel technological tools and datasets for multi -source satellite -based drought monitoring in the PLB.

The Bhilangana river basin, located in the central Himalayas, is predominantly characterized by increased elevation-dependent warming and declining seasonal precipitation. Our study shows that high-elevation temperature increased from 2000 to 2022 (0.05(degrees)C/year, p = < 0.05), which resulted in rapid frontal glacier retreat and expansion of glacier lakes. In this study, we used the Google Earth Engine platform to process satellite, reanalysis, and observational data records with descriptive and nonparametric statistical methods. Most of the debris-covered glaciers in this valley exhibited a significant rate of retreat in the last two decades (averaging 31 m per year), although the debris-free Masar glacier retreated even faster (49 m per year). In all, 13 glacier lakes were demarcated and intensively investigated at multi-temporal scales together with variations in area, volume, depth, and discharge at different geomorphologic locations. Maximum changes were detected in the land-terminated lake, which exhibited a significant increase in area (13,398 to 360,878 m(2)), volume (75,406 to 8,099,363 m(3)), depth (5.6 to 22.4 m), and discharge (13.3 to 304.6 m/sec) and is considered susceptible to a future flood event. In addition, unsteady flow estimation modeling was employed to describe peak discharge, depth, and velocity associated with regional flood extent over four distinctive simulation scenarios. Maximum peak discharge during the lake outburst is predicted to exceed 4500 m(3)/sec along with increased maximum water depth in the lower plains (44.2 m) and significantly elevated velocity (> 20 m/sec). Quantification of the regional hazard reveals potentially severe downstream challenges for low-to-medium-scale hydropower stations, local settlements, and road and railway bridges near Devling and Ghuttu villages.					; Sengupta, Dhritiraj/KHY-4968-2024; BANERJEE, ABHISHEK/LSL-8278-2024; Guo, Wanqin/E-7553-2015; Meadows, Michael/AAH-2461-2020; Zhang, Taigang/GYA-4431-2022; Wang, Weicai/GYA-1422-2022; Kang, Shichang/I-6830-2018	Wang, Weicai/0000-0003-1352-6303; Banerjee, Dr. Abhishek/0000-0002-2796-4243; Meadows, Michael/0000-0001-8322-3055; 													0921-030X	1573-0840				APR	2024	120	6					5485	5508		10.1007/s11069-024-06415-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-024-06415-5		FEB 2024											WOS:001162603900002

Five stations per river were sampled. Nutrients spatio-temporal distributions were mapped and showed nitrogen concentrations (nitrite 0.001 to 0.025 mg/L NO2--N, and nitrate 0.26 to 3.60 mg/L NO3--N) increased significantly with rainfall contrary to phosphorus (0.01 to 0.12 mg/L P). The Chl-a and TSItsr data revealed the hypereutrophic status of rivers. Moreover, N:P mass ratio suggests nitrogen as the main limiting factor of primary production during the low (March) and high flow periods (October-November), while phosphorus is the limiting factor in June, at the high flow beginning. The land uses around watersheds were the main sources of phosphorus and nitrogen enhancing the rivers' eutrophication. Phosphorus and nitrogen fluxes were related to leaching river catchments and were significant sources of nu-trients to the Atlantic Ocean.					; Yao, Koffi/W-6948-2019	SORO, MALEY-PACOME/0000-0002-4133-3755; 													0025-326X	1879-3363				JAN	2023	186								114391	10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.114391	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.114391		DEC 2022						36470099					WOS:000912044600002

Source contribution to phosphorus loads from the Maumee River watershed to Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Coastal eutrophication is a leading cause of degraded water quality around the world. Identifying the sources and their relative contributions to impaired downstream water quality is an important step in developing management plans to address water quality concerns. Recent mass-balance studies of Total Phosphorus (TP) loads of the Maumee River watershed highlight the considerable phosphorus contributions of non-point sources, including agricultural sources, degrading regional downstream water quality. This analysis builds upon these mass-balance studies by using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool to simulate the movement of phosphorus from manure, inorganic fertilizer, point sources, and soil sources, and respective loads of TP and Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus (DRP). This yields a more explicit estimation of source contribution from the watershed. Model simulations indicate that inorganic fertilizers contribute a greater proportion of TP (45% compared to 8%) and DRP (58% compared to 12%) discharged from the watershed than manure sources in the March-July period, the season driving harmful algal blooms. Although inorganic fertilizers contributed a greater mass of TP and DRP than manure sources, the two sources had similar average delivery fractions of TP (2.7% for inorganic fertilizers vs. 3.0% for manure sources) as well as DRP (0.7% for inorganic fertilizers vs. 1.2% for manure sources). Point sources contributed similar proportions of TP (5%) and DRP (12%) discharged in March-July as manure sources. Soil sources of phosphorus contributed over 40% of the March-July TP load and 20% of the March-July DRP load from the watershed to Lake Erie. Reductions of manures and inorganic fertilizers corresponded to a greater proportion of phosphorus delivered from soil sources of phosphorus, indicating that legacy phosphorus in soils may need to be a focus of management efforts to reach nutrient load reduction goals. In agricultural watersheds aground the world, including the Maumee River watershed, upstream nutrient management should not focus solely on an individual nutrient source; rather a comprehensive approach involving numerous sources should be undertaken.

J	Park, E				Park, Edward			Characterizing channel-floodplain connectivity using satellite altimetry: Mechanism, hydrogeomorphic control, and sediment budget	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												In this study, the mechanism of channel-floodplain seasonal connectivity along the Amazon River is analyzed over a full hydrological year through the use of satellite radar altimetry data (Jason-2). This is done via a novel observation-based approach which employs the concurrent measurement of water levels (WLs) over river and floodplain, analyzing seasonal changes in water surface height differences between the two water bodies. Hydrological connectivity thresholds at different stages during the rising phase were identified, and then validated using field data and remote sensing-driven surface suspended sediment maps. Successful decoupling of the two indiscrete flooding processes during the rising phase: channelized and overbank dispersion processes, is one of the major outcomes of this study. Different roles of the connectivity processes on floodplain hydro-geomorphology are highlighted - that channelized flows determine inundation frequency, residence time and development of positive topographic features in the floodplain, while overbank flows contribute a good part of the seasonal water storage and sediment budget in the floodplain, and tends to smooth positive topography built by channelized flows. The zones of overbank flooding, however, are rather localized due to the well-developed natural levee complex and stable channel-dominated floodplain along the river bank. Lastly, the presented approach is straightforward and solely based on publicly available operational data, making it easily adaptable by non-remote sensing experts. Thus, along with the emergence of new radar altimetry platforms, such as ICESat-2 or Jason-3 that could measure WL of smaller lakes, the proposed approach offers the potential to contribute to research on channel-floodplain systems in other rivers at a global scale.					; Park, Edward/JCD-7857-2023	Park, Edward/0000-0002-1299-1724; 													0034-4257	1879-0704				JUN 15	2020	243								111783	10.1016/j.rse.2020.111783	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.111783													WOS:000528309100004

However, connectivity quantification is currently incipient due to the scarcity of high spatial-temporal resolution observations and suitable connectivity metrics. This study generated a 30-m and 8-day surface water series of the Poyang Lake National Natural Reserve (PLNNR) in China by fusing Landsat and MODIS imagery. A geostatistical analysis was applied to quantify the surface water connectivity based on wet/dry binary state data derived from the fused images. The results demonstrate that the geostatistical method based on remote sensing is reliable and objective for quantifying the surface water connectivity in a complex lake-floodplain system. The highest connectivity function occurred around the flood peak, and lasted longest in the typical flood year. The seasonal isolated lakes, rivers, and main lake were interconnected via channelized and overbank flow paths at different stage thresholds. Under the combined effect of flood pulse and surface water connectivity, a seasonal isolated lake expanded more quickly after connection than before during the rising period, and shrank more slowly after isolation than before during the receding period. This study provides a novel insight into quantifying surface water connectivity, which helps policymakers understand floodplain behavior, both for this particular event and in general.					; xinggen, liu/AAQ-6640-2020; Wang, XiaoLong/AGP-5220-2022; Chen, Bin/ABD-5074-2021; ZHANG, Qi/MFJ-8647-2025	Liu, Xinggen/0000-0002-0252-0558; Chen, Bin/0000-0003-3496-2876; Tan, Zhiqiang/0000-0003-2853-4584; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				DEC	2019	579								124154	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124154	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124154													WOS:000500371200010

Contrasting land use effects on river quality at different spatial scales	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Understanding the influence of land-use activities on river quality has been a key focus of river monitoring programs worldwide. However, defining which land-use spatial scale is relevant remains elusive. In this study, therefore, we contrasted the influence of land use on river quality using three types of landuse estimators, namely circular buffers around a monitoring site, circular buffers upstream of the monitoring site and the entire watershed area upstream of the monitoring site. The land-use percentage compositions within the Usa-Kikuletwa River catchment in northeastern Tanzania were quantified using Landsat-8 satellite images with a maximum mapping resolution of 30 m. Redundancy analysis models and generalized linear models were used to evaluate the influence of land use on macroinvertebrate assemblages and physico-chemical water quality at different spatial scales in the dry and wet seasons. Overall, a substantial fraction of variation in physico-chemical water quality, macroinvertebrate taxon richness, Chao-1 and TARISS (Tanzania River Scoring System) score could be explained by land use of the entire watershed area upstream of the monitoring site in the dry and wet seasons. However, macroinvertebrate abundances showed strong links with more local land-use patterns within 100 m and 2 km radii. Circular buffers upstream of monitoring sites were more informative for macroinvertebrate assemblages than circular buffers around the monitoring sites. However, the latter did correlate well with physico-chemical water quality variables. Land-use variables correlated across spatial scales (i.e., 100 m up to 2 km radii), but not with the land use in the entire watershed area above the monitoring site. Our results indicate that physico-chemical water quality variables and macroinvertebrates may respond differently to land-uses at different scales. More importantly, our results illustrate that the choice regarding spatial land-use metrics can bias conclusions of environmental impact studies in river systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we collected water samples from eastern Lake Taihu, China. We targeted sites varying in their intensity of aquacultural activities and sampled them over multiple seasons. For each sample, we measured physicochemical variables, and we sequenced the 16S rRNA gene of the respective bacterial communities using an Illumina second-generation sequencing platform. Marked differences in diversity and bacterial community composition were observed between seasons, whereas we observed relatively weak differences between sites. Remarkable differences in the abundance of the bacterial community were observed at the phylum and genus levels across the different seasons. Stochastic processes dominated the assembly of bacterial communities in the aquaculture-influenced systems, and the assembly processes of bacterial community differed between seasons.

This is especially true in the U.S. Corn Belt, which has been recognized as the primary region contributing nutrient loads to the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico. A SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model simulation was set up in an agricultural watershed with about 50% tile drainage area in the U.S. Corn Belt to study the water and nutrient balance components for the whole watershed and the cornsoybean rotation system. The SWAT model was improved to consider additional nitrogen and phosphorus loss paths from the soil. The model was comprehensively calibrated and validated for simulating monthly stream flow, total suspended solids (TSS), nutrient loads (including total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), nitrate and nitrite nitrogen (NOx-N), total phosphorus (TP) and orthophosphate phosphorus (orthoP)), actual evapotranspiration (ETa), leaf area index (LAI) and annual crop yields in the watershed from 2011 to 2019. Results showed the model performance was very good for simulating the stream flow, TSS and ETa, and acceptable for nutrient loads, LAI and crop yields. ETa, surface runoff, lateral soil flow, tile drainage and percolation respectively accounted for 65%, 15%, 2%, 8% and 9% of the precipitation. Fertilizer was the main source of nitrogen and phosphorus input to the watershed, and harvested crops were the main paths removing nutrients. Surface runoff, tile drainage and percolation each contributed about 30% of total nitrogen losses to water, with surface runoff being dominated by organic nitrogen while tile drainage and percolation were dominated by nitrate nitrogen. Phosphorus losses were mainly through surface runoff, which resulted in 66% of the total losses and was dominated by organic phosphorus and soluble phosphorus. Representing about 49% of the watershed area, the corn-soybean rotation system contributed 83% and 88% of the total nitrogen and phosphorus inputs, respectively, to the watershed, as well as 64% and 46% of the nitrogen and phosphorus losses to the water system, respectively. The non-growing season (October to the next April) was identified as the critical period resulting in water and nutrient losses due to low evapotranspiration and plant uptake. Targeted management strategies for reducing nutrient loads in key hydrological paths were suggested.

In situ water quality samples of Chl a concentration were collected and correlated with water surface reflectance derived from Hyperion images, to develop a semi-empirical algorithm. Existing operational algorithms were tested and the continuous bands of Hyperion were evaluated in an iterative manner. A third order polynomial regression provided a good fit to model Chl a. The final algorithm uses a blue (467 nm) to green (559 nm) band ratio to successfully model Chl a concentrations in Lake Atitlan during the dry season, with a relative error of 33%. This analysis confirmed the suitability of hyperspetral-imagers like Hyperion, to model Chl a concentrations in Lake Atitlan. This study also highlights the need to test and update this algorithm with operational multispectral sensors such as Landsat and Sentinel-2.

Applied to analyse trends in annual and seasonal runoff over this period, the sequential MK test showed a sudden change point in stream flow in 1994. The study period was, therefore, divided into two sub-periods: 1975-1994 and 1995-2010. The SWAT model showed obvious changes in water resource components between the two periods: in comparison to the period of 1975-1994, sub-watershed-scale stream flow and soil moisture decreased during 1995-2010. Changes in evapotranspiration were negligible compared to those in stream flow and soil moisture. The hydrological sensitivity method indicated that climatic variability and human activities contributed to 29.86% and 70.14%, respectively, of changes in annual stream flow, while the SWAT model placed these contributions at 34.78% and 65.21%, respectively. The double mass curve method indicated the contribution of climatic variability to stream flow changes to be 57.5% for the wet season and 22.87% for the dry season, while human activities contributed 42.5% and 77.13%, respectively. Accordingly, in the face of climatic variability, measures should be developed and implemented to mitigate its impacts and maintain eco-environmental integrity and water supplies.

However, their effects on soil denitrification and the major N loss in rice paddies over an entire rice-growing season are not well understood. In this study, using intact soil core incubation combined with N-2/Ar technique, the impacts of biochar and a nitrification inhibitor (Ni), 2-chloro-6-(trichloromethyl)-pyridine, on rice yield and soil denitrification, as well as ammonia (NH3) volatilization, were investigated over two rice growing seasons in the Taihu Lake region of China. Field experiments were designed with four treatments: NO (no N applied), N270 (270 kg N ha(-1) applied), N270 + C (25 t ha(-1) biochar applied) and N270 + Ni (2chloro-6- Itrichloromethyl] -pyridine, 135 kg ha-1 N applied). Compared with single application of N fertilizer alone (N270), biochar (N270 + C) and Ni (N270 + Ni) applications increased rice yields by 4.2-5.2% and 6.2-7.3%, respectively. The cumulative N-2-N and NH3-N losses in different treatments varied from 11.9 to 21.8% and from 11.5 to 22.0% of the applied N, respectively. Compared with the single application of N fertilizer, the Ni application increased total NH3 emission by 4.0-20.6% and significantly decreased total N-2-N emission by 9.7-19.4% (p < 0.05), while the biochar application increased total NH3 and N-2-N emissions by 8.6-17.9% and 3.3-9.7%, respectively. Overall, the biochar application resulted in an 11-15% higher net gaseous N than the Ni application. Although the biochar application may increase the rice yield and consequently the plant N uptake, it also promoted N loss more than Ni. Therefore biochar may not be good for maintaining soil fertility over a long period. Instead, applying Ni may be an optimal practice to ensure food security, while decreasing gaseous N loss, for rice production in the Taihu Lake region of China. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Guiding principles for the development and application of solid-phase phosphorus adsorbents for freshwater ecosystems	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Whilst a diverse array of phosphorus (P)-adsorbent materials is currently available for application to freshwater aquatic systems, selection of the most appropriate P-adsorbents remains problematic. In particular, there has to be a close correspondence between attributes of the P-adsorbent, its field performance and the management goals for treatment. These management goals may vary from a rapid reduction in dissolved P to address seasonal enrichments from internal loading, targeting external fluxes due to anthropogenic sources, or long-term inactivation of internal P inventories contained within bottom sediments. It also remains a challenge to develop new methods and materials that are ecologically benign and cost-effective. We draw on evidence in the literature and the authors' personal experiences in the field, to summarise the attributes of a range of P-adsorbent materials. We offer 'guiding principles' to support practical use of existing materials and outline key development needs for new materials.					; Hamilton, David/F-5039-2012; Hamilton, David P/F-5039-2012; Douglas, Grant/A-5632-2008; Pan, Gang/F-1406-2010; Spears, Bryan/I-3688-2012	Pan, FRSC, Gang/0000-0003-0920-3018; Hamilton, David P/0000-0002-9341-8777; Douglas, Grant/0000-0002-9398-164X; 													1386-2588	1573-5125				SEP	2016	50	3			SI		385	405		10.1007/s10452-016-9575-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-016-9575-2													WOS:000382632100005

The comparison was made considering phase 5 and phase 3 of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project, i.e. CMIP5 and CMIP3 respectively. For the CMIP5 (CMIP3) at each station, there were a total of 7 (14) GCMs, 18 (20) daily historical (control) simulations over the period 1961-2000, and 35 (49) daily future projection series of the periods 2050s and 2090s. The ensemble mean of the GCMs' Bias in reproducing rainfall extremes for return periods in the range of 1 to 40 years for the CMIP5 (CMIP3) varied from -19.05% to 3.11% (-65.85% to -4.86%). For the high greenhouse gas scenario rcp8.5 (A2) of the CMIP5 (CMIP3), the ensemble mean of the projected changes over the LVB in the 10-year rainfall intensity quantile obtained from the Delta, simQP, wetQP SD goes up to 5.8, 10 and 22.4% (11.7, 15.9 and 43.6%) in the 2050s and 8, 11.4, and 25.4% (14.2, 23.3 and 40.6%) in the 2090s. Rainfall totals of the main wet (dry) season are generally projected to increase (decrease) in both the 2050s and 2090s. Because the outputs from the three SD methods captured well the pattern of monthly rainfall totals, the difference between the projected changes of seasonal or annual rainfall totals from the Delta, simQP and wetQP was shown to be insignificant. However, the differences in the results from the Delta, simQP and wetQP methods with respect to the projections of rainfall quantiles indicate that the choice of the SD method can be made on a case by case basis in line with the objectives of the climate change impact study, e.g. the Delta does not capture well the changes in rainfall extremes, whereas the wetQP is suitable for both rainfall extremes and rainfall totals at both seasonal and annual time scales. The findings of this study also show the need to consider evaluations of the inter-GCM differences in the LVB as a data scarce region in assessing the discernible impact of climate change on rainfall extremes and/totals for decision making related to water resources management and engineering.

However, early studies on PAEs only focused on six species on the priority contaminant list, and the seasonal variation in the PAE distribution in Taihu Lake. China is unclear. The present study investigated the occurrence, spatial distribution, and ecological risks of 16 PAEs in Taihu Lake during the dry, normal, and wet seasons. The results showed that dibutyl phthalate, diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP) were the major species detected in the surface water of Taihu Lake. The summed concentration of the six priority PAEs accounted for less than 50% of the total, indicating that the contamination of the other PAE congeners was non-negligible. Significant seasonal effects were observed that the total PAE concentration was higher in the wet season than in the dry season, and there were significant positive correlations between the total PAE concentration and rainfall, the water reserve, and the water level. In the dry season, a relatively high PAE level was detected in the area close to the inflow river estuary and the tourist island in the lake. The concentrations of PAEs in the lakeshore area were higher than those in the lake center in the normal season, and were generally high in the wet season. DEHP posed high risks for fish regardless of the season, while butyl benzyl phthalate, DIBP, dihexyl phthalate, and diphenyl phthalate also showed high risks in the normal and wet seasons. These results suggest that the contamination and risks of congeners other than the priority PAEs are also of necessary concern, and seasonal variation should be considered for a comprehensive understanding of PAE contamination in surface water.

J	Lencioni, V				Lencioni, Valeria			Glacial influence and stream macroinvertebrate biodiversity under climate change: Lessons from the Southern Alps	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The aim of this work was to highlight the main ecological predictors driving invertebrate distribution in eight glacier-fed streams in the Southern Alps. Thirty-five sites belonging to four stream types were sampled monthly during the ablation season of one, two or three years between 1996 and 2014. Taxa from glacial (kryal and glacio-rhithral) and non-glacial (kreno-rhithral and lake outlet) sites were separated by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) along a glacial influence gradient and a hydrological-altitudinal gradient. High glacial influence was associated mainly with low maximum water temperature (Tmax), high Glacial Index (calculated as a function of glacier area and distance from the glacier), and the abundance of Diamesa species (D. steinboecki, D. goetghebueri, D. zernyi, and D. latitarsis). Change-point analysis and Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis confirmed the CCA results in identifying these Diamesa species as the taxa with the strongest preference for high percent glacier cover in the catchment (change point similar to 30%) and low Tmax (change point similar to 6 degrees C). Temporal changes in community structure were highlighted in seven sites fed by glaciers under different retreat rates. Where the rate was faster and the remaining glacier smaller (<< 1 km(2)), the most cold-stenothermal kryal inhabitant, D. steinboecki, almost disappeared or survived only as brachypterous populations, whereas other Diamesinae (Pseudokiefferiella parva), Orthocladiinae (e.g. Eukiefferiella, Orthocladius), Limoniidae, Baetidae, Nemouridae, and non-insect taxa (e.g. Oligochaeta, Hydracarina) became more abundant. Upstream migration was observed in Diamesa spp. which conquered new stream reaches left free by the retreating glacier, and euriecious taxa which colonized reaches with ameliorated environmental conditions, no longer the exclusive habitat of Diamesa spp. Co-occurrence of stochastic and deterministic assembly processes seem to drive spatio-temporal changes in these invertebrate communities. Long-term ecological studies on the adaptive biology of kryal species will be useful to predict the fate of Alpine biodiversity. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Shi, XX; Lohmann, G; Sidorenko, D; Yang, H				Shi, Xiaoxu; Lohmann, Gerrit; Sidorenko, Dmitry; Yang, Hu			Early-Holocene simulations using different forcings and resolutions in AWI-ESM	HOLOCENE												The earliest part of the Holocene, from 11.5k to 7k (k = 1000 years before present), is a critical transition period between the relatively cold last deglaciation and the warm middle Holocene. It is marked by more pronounced seasonality and reduced greenhouse gases (GHGs) than the present state, as well as by the presence of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) and glacial meltwater perturbation. This paper performs experiments under pre-industrial and different early-Holocene regimes with AWI-ESM (Alfred Wegener Institute-Earth System Model), a state-of-the-art climate model with unstructured mesh and varying resolutions, to examine the sensitivity of the simulated Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) to early-Holocene insolation, GHGs, topography (including properties of the ice sheet), and glacial meltwater perturbation. In the experiments with early-Holocene Earth orbital parameters and GHGs applied, the AWI-ESM simulation shows a JJA (June-July-August) warming and DJF (December-January-February) cooling over the mid and high latitudes compared with pre-industrial conditions, with amplification over the continents. The presence of the LIS leads to an additional regional cooling over the North America. We also simulate the meltwater event around 8.2k. Big discrepancies are found in the oceanic responses to different locations and magnitudes of freshwater discharge. Our experiments, which compare the effects of freshwater release evenly across the Labrador Sea to a more precise injection along the western boundary of the North Atlantic (the coastal region of LIS), show significant differences in the ocean circulation response, as the former produces a major decline of the AMOC and the latter yields no obvious effect on the strength of the thermohaline circulation. Furthermore, proglacial drainage of Lakes Agassiz and Ojibway leads to a fast spin-down of the AMOC, followed, however, by a gradual recovery. Most hosing experiments lead to a warming over the Nordic Sea and Barents Sea of varying magnitudes, because of an enhanced inflow from lower latitudes and a northward displacement of the North Atlantic deep convection. These processes exist in both of our high- and low-resolution experiments, but with some local discrepancies such as (1) the hosing-induced subpolar warming is much less pronounced in the high-resolution simulations; (2) LIS coastal melting in the high-resolution model leads to a slight decrease in the AMOC; and (3) the convection formation site in the low- and high-resolution experiments differs, in the former mainly over northeastern North Atlantic Ocean, but in the latter over a very shallow subpolar region along the northern edge of the North Atlantic Ocean. In conclusion, we find that our simulations capture spatially heterogeneous responses of the early-Holocene climate.					; Shi, Xiaoxu/MCX-6528-2025; Yang, Hu/AAA-1437-2021	Yang, Hu/0000-0003-2054-2256; Shi, Xiaoxu/0000-0001-7793-9639; Sidorenko, Dmitry/0000-0001-8579-6068; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				JUL	2020	30	7					996	1015	0959683620908634	10.1177/0959683620908634	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683620908634		MAR 2020											WOS:000524567800001

Nevertheless, relatively few studies have focused on these dynamics on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). In this study, soil hydraulic conductivities, saturated thicknesses, and related hydrological processes were observed in situ around a typical thermokarst lake during the warm season. The results showed that the water table in the active layer fluctuated markedly from June to October and at depths of up to 1.0 m. The discharge of suprapermafrost groundwater was often <0.1 m(2) d(-1), which was attributed to the thin aquifer and low permeability of the active layer. Groundwater fluxes were controlled by the freeze-thaw cycle and local factors, and were altered by rainfall events and evapotranspiration. The contributions of suprapermafrost groundwater to the thermokarst lake water were often <1.4 mm d(-1), and were greater in the late warm season. Moreover, surface runoff in initial warm season was the dominant water resource in some open parts of the lake, and the frequent exchange between surface runoff and lake water accelerated the degradation of the permafrost beneath the lake. These findings provide insights into the role of suprapermafrost groundwater in regional hydrological cycles and the evolution of thermokarst lakes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				FEB	2021	593								125882	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125882	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125882		JAN 2021											WOS:000639853400066

The Yangtze River Delta is one of the most developed regions in China with the rapid development of urbanization which serves as an excellent case study site for understanding the hydrological response to urbanization and land use change. The Xitiaoxi River basin, one of the main upstream rivers to the Taihu Lake in the Yangtze River Delta, was selected to perform the study. The urban area in the basin increased from 37.8 km(2) in 1985 to 105 km(2) in 2008. SWAT model, which makes direct use of land cover and land use data in simulating streamflow, provides as a useful tool for performing such studies and is therefore used in this study. The results showed that (1) the expansion of urban areas had a slight influence on the simulated annual streamflow and evapotranspiration (ET) as far as the whole catchment is concerned; (2) surface runoff and baseflow were found more sensitive to urbanization, which had increased by 11.3% and declined by 11.2%, respectively; (3) changes in streamflow, evapotranspiration and surface runoff were more pronounced during the wet season (from May to August), while baseflow and lateral flow had a slight seasonal variation; (4) the model simulated peak discharge increased 1.6-4.3% and flood volume increased 0.7-2.3% for the selected storm rainfall events at the entire basin level, and the change rate was larger for smaller flood events than for larger events; (5) spatially, changes of hydrological fluxes were more remarkable in the suburban basin which had a relative larger increase in urbanization than in rural sub-basins; and (6) analysis of future scenarios showed the impacts of urbanization on hydrological fluxes would be more obvious with growth in impervious areas from 15% to 30%. In conclusion, the urbanization would have a slight impact on annual water yield, but a remarkable impact was found on surface runoff, peak discharge and flood volume especially in suburban basins in the study area. The study suggested that more attention must be paid for flood mitigation and water resources management in planning future urban development in the region. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Stability indices, including Lake Number, Wedderburn Number, Schmidt Stability, and thermocline depth are calculated according to established literature definitions and returned to the user in a time series format. The program was created for the analysis of high-frequency data collected from instrumented lake buoys, in support of the emerging field of aquatic sensor network science. Available outputs for the lake Analyzer program are: water temperature (error-checked and/or down-sampled), wind speed (error-checked and/or down-sampled), metalimnion extent (top and bottom), thermocline depth, friction velocity, Lake Number, Wedderburn Number, Schmidt Stability, mode-1 vertical seiche period, and Brunt-Vaisala buoyancy frequency. Secondary outputs for several of these indices delineate the parent thermocline depth (seasonal thermocline) from the shallower secondary or diurnal thermocline. Lake Analyzer provides a program suite and best practices for the comparison of mixing and stratification indices in lakes across gradients of climate, hydro-physiography, and time, and enables a more detailed understanding of the resulting biogeochemical transformations at different spatial and temporal scales.

J	Liu, XH; Lu, SY; Meng, W; Wang, WL				Liu, Xiaohui; Lu, Shaoyong; Meng, Wei; Wang, Weiliang			Occurrence, source, and ecological risk of antibiotics in Dongting Lake, China	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The pollution characteristics and ecological risk of 12 classified as sulfonamide, trimethoprim, quinolone, and tetracycline antibiotics in Dongting Lake, China, were studied. The total concentrations of the antibiotics ranged from 1.06 to 135.40 ng L-1 for all sampling sites. The highest average concentration was observed for sulfadiazine, followed by sulfamethoxazole. The detection frequencies (over 60%) of sulfonamides were higher than those of other antibiotics. The direct discharge of the aquaculture, livestock, and poultry wastewater might be the main pollution sources of antibiotics in the Dongting Lake. The pollution levels of antibiotics decreased in the order of East Dongting Lake > South Dongting Lake > West Dongting Lake, which may be related to the distribution and the scale of the aquaculture, livestock, and poultry sources. The seasonal changes of antibiotic concentration were relatively diversified, with the dry season generally having higher concentrations than the wet season. The results of the ecological risk assessment indicated that sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and sarafloxacin might pose a significant risk to the aquatic organisms in Dongting Lake, especially in Potou and Nandu. This study enriches the research of emerging pollutants in freshwater lake.

Modeling Anthropogenic and Environmental Influences on Freshwater Harmful Algal Bloom Development Detected by MERIS Over the Central United States	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Human and ecological health have been threatened by the increase of cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) in freshwater systems. Successful mitigation of this risk requires understanding the factors driving cyanoHABs at a broad scale. To inform management priorities and decisions, we employed random forest modeling to identify major cyanoHAB drivers in 369 freshwater lakes distributed across 15 upper Midwest states during the 2011 bloom season (July-October). We used Cyanobacteria Index (CI_cyano)-A remotely sensed product derived from the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) aboard the European Space Agency's Envisat satellite-as the response variable to obtain variable importance metrics for 75 landscape and lake physiographic predictor variables. Lakes were stratified into high and low elevation categories to further focus CI_cyano variable importance identification by anthropogenic and natural influences. "High elevation" watershed land cover (LC) was primarily forest or natural vegetation, compared with "low elevation" watersheds LC dominated by anthropogenic landscapes (e.g., agriculture and municipalities). We used the top ranked 25 Random Forest variables to create a classification and regression tree (CART) for both low and high elevation lake designations to identify variable thresholds for possible management mitigation. Mean CI_cyano was 3 times larger for "low elevation" lakes than for "high elevation" lakes, with both mean values exceeding the "High" World Health Organization recreational guidance/action level threshold for cyanobacteria (100,000 cells/mL). Agrarian-related variables were prominent across all 369 lakes and low elevation lakes. High elevation lakes showed more influence of lakeside LC than for the low elevation lakes.					; Mehaffey, Megan/A-7476-2009	Salls, Wilson/0000-0001-7505-0828; Schaeffer, Blake/0000-0001-9794-3977; Christensen, Jay/0000-0003-4961-6132; Iiames, John/0000-0002-0552-284X; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				OCT	2021	57	10							e2020WR028946	10.1029/2020WR028946	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020WR028946								35860362					WOS:000711970600004

However, the ability of the existing reservoirs and proposed hydraulic projects to restore the HR is not yet clear. A hydrological model for the middle Yangtze River was used in combination with a lake water balance model to assess the recovery degree of the Poyang Lake HR under the regulation of the existing reservoirs and proposed hydraulic projects.New hydrological insights for the region: In the past 20 years, the water level of Poyang Lake decreased by 5.9%, and the duration of the drought (lake level < 12 m) was prolonged by 39.5% compared to 1953-2002. The potential recovery capacity of the existing reservoirs (including the TGR and the lake catchment reservoirs) and the proposed hydraulic project (PLHP) at the discharging waterway at the north end of Poyang Lake was quantified for typical hydrological years. It was found that the HR in typical hydrological years can be entirely restored by joint regulation of the existing reservoirs, but that this method is not successful in extremely dry years. The PLHP can cope with extreme droughts, such as that in 2022, to restore the lake to a reasonable water level.					; ZHANG, Qi/MFJ-8647-2025; Yuan, Saiyu/ABH-9996-2020	Xue, Chenyang/0000-0002-1303-5013; Zhang, Qi/0000-0002-0669-9671; 														2214-5818				DEC	2023	50								101548	10.1016/j.ejrh.2023.101548	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2023.101548		OCT 2023											WOS:001110922900001

Supervised classification of slush and ponded water on Antarctic ice shelves using Landsat 8 imagery	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Surface meltwater is becoming increasingly widespread on Antarctic ice shelves. It is stored within surface ponds and streams, or within firn pore spaces, which may saturate to form slush. Slush can reduce firn air content, increasing an ice-shelf's vulnerability to break-up. To date, no study has mapped the changing extent of slush across ice shelves. Here, we use Google Earth Engine and Landsat 8 images from six ice shelves to generate training classes using a k-means clustering algorithm, which are used to train a random forest classifier to identify both slush and ponded water. Validation using expert elicitation gives accuracies of 84% and 82% for the ponded water and slush classes, respectively. Errors result from subjectivity in identifying the ponded water/slush boundary, and from inclusion of cloud and shadows. We apply our classifier to the Roi Baudouin Ice Shelf for the entire 2013-20 Landsat 8 record. On average, 64% of all surface meltwater is classified as slush and 36% as ponded water. Total meltwater areal extent is greatest between late January and mid-February. This highlights the importance of mapping slush when studying surface meltwater on ice shelves. Future research will apply the classifier across all Antarctic ice shelves.					; Arnold, Neil/AAI-2272-2021; Banwell, Alison/W-8180-2018; Pritchard, Hamish/AAU-4696-2021; Dell, Rebecca/MXM-0655-2025; Chudley, Tom/AAH-7919-2019; Halberstadt, Anna Ruth/JPW-9990-2023	Dell, Rebecca/0000-0001-6617-3906; Banwell, Alison/0000-0001-9545-829X; Chudley, Tom/0000-0001-8547-1132; Halberstadt, Anna Ruth/0000-0003-2582-7074; Willis, Ian/0000-0002-0750-7088													0022-1430	1727-5652				APR	2022	68	268					401	414	PII S0022143021001143	10.1017/jog.2021.114	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jog.2021.114		NOV 2021											WOS:000774705100001
J	Yao, JF; Chen, S; Ruan, XH				Yao, Jiefu; Chen, Shuai; Ruan, Xiaohong			Interpretable CEEMDAN-FE-LSTM-transformer hybrid model for predicting total phosphorus concentrations in surface water	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The complexity of the biogeochemical cycle of phosphorus in lakes makes it challenging to produce efficient and accurate predictions of total phosphorus (TP) concentrations. In this study, a hybrid model is developed for TP predictions. This model combines the Complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise, Fuzzy entropy, Long short-term memory, and Transformer (CF-LT). The introduction of data split-frequency reconstruction effectively solves the problems of over- and underfitting suffered by previous machine learning models in the face of high-dimensional data, while an attention mechanism overcomes the inability of these models to establish long-term dependencies between data when making long-term predictions. The CF-LT model is applied to predict TP concentrations from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2020, at Yaoxiangqiao, Zhihugang, and Guanduqiao, three national water quality monitoring stations at the inlet of Taihu Lake, China. Moreover, the Shapley additive explanations are used to interpret the CF-LT model and identify the essential input features. The prediction results demonstrate that the CF-LT model achieves a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.37-0.87 on the test dataset, representing an improvement of 0.05-0.17 (6%-85%) over the control models. In addition, the CF-LT model provides the best peak value predictions. The model interpretation results indicate that the turbidity and total nitrogen are the essential factors influencing TP predictions. This demonstrates that the TP concentrations at the inlet of Taihu Lake are closely related to the non-point pollution discharge and the status of aquatic plants. It's worth noting that these two indicators exert a more significant influence on the prediction of TP during wet season. This work provides a viable modeling strategy for predicting TP concentrations and guidance for early warning and treatment of surface water eutrophication in the Taihu Lake basin.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				FEB	2024	629								130609	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.130609	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.130609		JAN 2024											WOS:001162889300001

VOCs have important ecological functions and implications for atmospheric chemistry and climate. We measured the ecosystem-level surface-atmosphere VOC fluxes using the eddy covariance technique at a shallow subarctic lake and an adjacent graminoid-dominated fen in northern Sweden during two contrasting periods: the peak growing season (mid-July) and the senescent period post-growing season (September-October). In July, the fen was a net source of methanol, acetaldehyde, acetone, dimethyl sulfide, isoprene, and monoterpenes. All of these VOCs showed a did cycle of emission with maxima around noon and isoprene dominated the fluxes (93 +/- 22 mu mol m(-2) d(-1), mean +/- SE). Isoprene emission was strongly stimulated by temperature and presented a steeper response to temperature (Q(10) = 14.5) than that typically assumed in biogenic emission models, supporting the high temperature sensitivity of arctic vegetation. In September, net emissions of methanol and isoprene were drastically reduced, while acetaldehyde and acetone were deposited to the fen, with rates of up to -6.7 +/- 2.8 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) for acetaldehyde. Remarkably, the lake was a sink for acetaldehyde and acetone during both periods, with average fluxes up to -19 +/- 1.3 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) of acetone in July and up to -8.5 +/- 2.3 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) of acetaldehyde in September. The deposition of both carbonyl compounds correlated with their atmospheric mixing ratios, with deposition velocities of -0.23 +/- 0.01 and -0.68 +/- 0.03 cm s(-1) for acetone and acetaldehyde, respectively. Even though these VOC fluxes represented less than 0.5 % and less than 5 % of the CO2 and CH4 net carbon ecosystem exchange, respectively, VOCs alter the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere. Thus, understanding the response of their emissions to climate change is important for accurate prediction of the future climatic conditions in this rapidly warming area of the planet.

This research focused on the Ghodaghodi Lake Complex (GLC) and associated lakes in Nepal, a Ramsar-listed site known for its biodiversity and ecological significance. The study was conducted to assess seasonal water quality, investigate the factors influencing hydrochemistry, and assess the lakes' suitability for irrigation. Forty-nine water samples were collected from the GLC in pre-monsoon and post-monsoon periods. Nineteen physicochemical parameters, such as dissolved oxygen (DO), total dissolved solids (TDS), and major ions (calcium 'Ca2+', magnesium 'Mg2+', and bicarbonate 'HCO3-'), were analyzed using standard on-site and laboratory methods. Statistical methods, including analysis of variance (ANOVA), T-tests, and hydrochemical diagrams, e.g., Piper, were adopted to explore spatial and seasonal variations in water quality, revealing significant fluctuations in key hydrochemical indicators. Results showed marked seasonal differences, with pre-monsoon TDS levels averaging 143.1 mg/L compared to 78.9 mg/L post-monsoon, underscoring evaporation and dilution effects. The hydrochemical analysis identified Ca2+-HCO3- as the dominant water type, highlighting the influence of carbonate weathering on GLC's water composition. Gibbs, mixing, and Piper diagram analysis supported these findings, confirming the predominance of HCO3-, with Ca2+ and Mg2+ as the main cations. Additionally, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) values were consistently below 1, confirming excellent irrigation quality. These findings provided critical data for policymakers and stakeholders, supporting sustainable wetland management and aligning with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals relevant to environmental conservation, i.e., clean water and life on land.

Comparative Analysis of Microcystin Prevalence in Michigan Lakes by Online Concentration LC/MS/MS and ELISA	TOXINS												Fast and reliable workflows are needed to quantitate microcystins (MCs), a ubiquitous class of hepatotoxic cyanotoxins, so that the impact of human and environmental exposure is assessed quickly and minimized. Our goal was to develop a high-throughput online concentration liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) workflow to quantitate the 12 commercially available MCs and nodularin in surface and drinking waters. The method run time was 8.5 min with detection limits in the low ng/L range and minimum reporting levels between 5 and 10 ng/L. This workflow was benchmarked by determining the prevalence of MCs and comparing the Adda-ELISA quantitation to our new workflow from 122 samples representing 31 waterbodies throughout Michigan. The frequency of MC occurrence was MC-LA > LR > RR > D-Asp(3)-LR > YR > HilR > WR > D-Asp(3)-RR > HtyR > LY = LW = LF, while MC-RR had the highest concentrations. MCs were detected in 33 samples and 13 of these samples had more than 20% of their total MC concentration from MCs not present in US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) Method 544. Furthermore, seasonal deviations between the LC/MS/MS and Adda-ELISA data suggest Adda-ELISA cross-reacts with MC degradation products. This workflow provides less than 24-h turnaround for quantification and also identified key differences between LC/MS/MS and ELISA quantitation that should be investigated further.																				2072-6651				JAN	2019	11	1							13	10.3390/toxins11010013	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxins11010013								30609666					WOS:000459733500013

The importance of lakes for bat conservation in Amazonian rainforests: an assessment using autonomous recorders	REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Recent studies predict a future decrease in precipitation across the tropics, particularly the Amazon, likely causing significant droughts that have negative consequences for Amazonian freshwater biomes, especially lakes. Furthermore, immediate consequences of global warming for terrestrial fauna associated with tropical lakes are poorly understood as the vast majority of studies come from temperate regions. Here, we assess the seasonal importance of lakes for the conservation of aerial insectivorous bats in the Central Amazon using passive bat recorders. We compared richness, general bat activity and foraging activity between lakes and adjacent forest. Of a total of 21 species/sonotypes recorded in both habitats, all were detected over lakes, and 18 were significantly more active over lakes than in forest. Only two species had significantly higher activity levels in the forest than at the lakes. Species richness and general bat activity over the lakes were higher in the dry than in the rainy season. Foraging activity was also greater over the lakes than within the forest in both seasons. Moreover, both variables were positively correlated with lake size, although the effect on activity was species-specific. Climate change-driven shrinking of lakes may have detrimental consequences for aerial insectivorous bats, especially for the most water-dependent species. Compared to permanent water bodies of other regions, the value of tropical lakes for functionally important taxa, such as bats, has been understudied. Higher bat activity levels over lakes than in forest in both seasons and comprising the whole ensemble of aerial insectivorous bats of the study region, indicate that lakes embedded in Amazonian terra firme forests deserve special attention for future bat conservation.

J	Wang, SQ; Zhang, X; Wang, C; Chen, NC				Wang, Siqi; Zhang, Xiang; Wang, Chao; Chen, Nengcheng			Temporal continuous monitoring of cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Taihu at an hourly scale using machine learning	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Cyanobacterial blooms in most lakes exhibit extraordinary changes in time and space. Herein, a cyanobacterial predic-tion model was designed for Lake Taihu based on a machine learning method. This method can generate temporally continuous (24 moments throughout the day) cyanobacterial data at a fine spatial scale of 9 km. The hourly meteoro-logical data for 24 moments of the day were obtained from ERA5-Land data. Areal coverage of cyanobacterial blooms was derived from the hourly Geostationary Ocean Color Imager reflectance data observed only eight times a day (from similar to 8:00 to similar to 15:00, UTC+8). The cyanobacterial and meteorological data of eight moments in Lake Taihu from 2011 to 2020 were used to design the prediction model. The results were compared and validated employing nine training strategies to determine the best cyanobacterial prediction model for Lake Taihu (R = 0.42; root mean square error = 0.10). With the best -fitted model utilizing meteorological data (2011-2020), the area coverage of cyanobacterial blooms at the other 16 moments during a day were estimated. Based on this, the regional and temporal characteristics of diurnal bloom variation were evaluated at an hourly scale. The results indicated that the hourly variations in the areal coverage of cyanobacterial blooms at 24 moments of the day had similar patterns in each subregion of Lake Taihu with minor seasonal variations. The six meteorological variables adopted to construct the model had similar di-urnal changes but with diverse value ranges among the seasons. Further analysis revealed that three meteorological variables (temperature, surface pressure, and evaporation) were positively related to diurnal bloom variations at an hourly scale. Overall, these results illustrate that meteorological conditions can affect the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms at multiple time scales (e.g., hourly, daily, or monthly). The developed cyanobacterial prediction model can provide cyanobacterial data when cyanobacterial data is unavailable for the target waterbody.					; ZHANG, Xiang/H-3158-2013; Zhang, Xiang/H-3158-2013	Chen, Nengcheng/0000-0002-3521-9972; Zhang, Xiang/0000-0002-1017-742X													0048-9697	1879-1026				JAN 20	2023	857		2						159480	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159480	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159480		OCT 2022						36265631					WOS:000906906400009

However, the magnitudes of GHG fluxes remain uncertain due to limited research data, especially on the Tibetan Plateau. In this study Methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) concentrations were measured and their diffusive fluxes were estimated by headspace-gas chromatography in two rivers basins (Buha and Shaliu rivers) on the Northeast Tibetan Plateau during three seasons from October 2020 to August 2021. The results showed that the focal rivers on the Tibetan Plateau are potentially important sources of GHG. Both rivers have higher GHG concentrations and diffusion flux during the snowmelt period than other seasons. In general, GHG diffusion fluxes in the Buha river were higher than those in the Shaliu river and their concentrations are higher in the upstream region than in the downstream region of both basins. The salinity in water and wind spread were found to be important factors influencing in GHGs diffusion fluxes. While diffusive fluxes of GHG in rivers were a small component of watershed-scale fluvial Carbon gas efflux compared to other studies, these fluxes will likely increase as thaw slump occurrence. Overall, this study highlights that better recognition of the influence that river networks have on global warming is required-especially when it comes to high-elevation rivers across permafrost, as permafrost will continue to thaw as climate warming.					wang, lei/JQV-5907-2023; Du, Jia/ADR-8738-2022														0048-9697	1879-1026				JAN 20	2023	857		1						159373	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159373	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159373		OCT 2022						36240936					WOS:000899042400003
J	Peter, H; Sommaruga, R				Peter, Hannes; Sommaruga, Ruben			Shifts in diversity and function of lake bacterial communities upon glacier retreat	ISME JOURNAL												Global climate change is causing a wastage of glaciers and threatening biodiversity in glacier-fed ecosystems. The high turbidity typically found in those ecosystems, which is caused by inorganic particles and result of the erosive activity of glaciers is a key environmental factor influencing temperature and light availability, as well as other factors in the water column. Once these lakes loose hydrological connectivity to glaciers and turn clear, the accompanying environmental changes could represent a potential bottleneck for the established local diversity with yet unknown functional consequences. Here, we study three lakes situated along a turbidity gradient as well as one clear unconnected lake and evaluate seasonal changes in their bacterial community composition and diversity. Further, we assess potential consequences for community functioning. Glacier runoff represented a diverse source community for the lakes and several taxa were able to colonize downstream turbid habitats, although they were not found in the clear lake. Operational taxonomic unit-based alpha diversity and phylogenetic diversity decreased along the turbidity gradient, but metabolic functional diversity was negatively related to turbidity. No evidence for multifunctional redundancy, which may allow communities to maintain functioning upon alterations in diversity, was found. Our study gives a first view on how glacier-fed lake bacterial communities are affected by the melting of glaciers and indicates that diversity and community composition significantly change when hydrological connectivity to the glacier is lost and lakes turn clear.					; Sommaruga, Ruben/E-5335-2011	Peter, Hannes/0000-0001-9021-3082; Sommaruga, Ruben/0000-0002-1055-2461													1751-7362	1751-7370				JUL	2016	10	7					1545	1554		10.1038/ismej.2015.245	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ismej.2015.245								26771929					WOS:000378292100001

AQUATIC ECOLOGY												The European Water Framework Directive implements the policies to achieve a good ecological status of all European waterbodies. To determine the ecological potential in freshwater environments, abiotic (morphology, physical and chemical variables) and biotics (algae, fishes, etc.) metrics are used. Despite their importance in trophic web, zooplankton was not included as one of the Biological Quality Elements (BQE) to determine the water quality. In the present research, we studied the zooplankton species that can be considered as indicators of trophic status and ecological potential for more than 60 water reservoirs. The data were obtained from more of 300 samples collected during 10 years from reservoirs at Ebro River watershed, which is the largest basin in Spain. According to their physicochemical and biological elements, the trophic status and ecological potential of these reservoirs were established. More than 150 zooplankton species were identified during the study. The results from this research indicate that species that are related with low water quality are: Acanthocyclops americanus, Ceriodaphnia spp., Daphnia cucullata, Daphnia parvula, Diaphanosoma brachyurum, Brachionus angularis, Keratella cochlearis and Phompolyx sulcata. An indicator of moderate quality was Bosmina longirostris, while Daphnia longispina, Ascomorpha ovalis and Ascomorpha saltans were considered as indicators of good water quality. The data obtained suggest that zooplankton species can be used as a valuable tool to determine the water quality status and should be considered, in a near future, as one more of the BQE within the WFD metrics.					; Soria, Juan/M-1699-2014	Vicente-Pedros, Eduardo/0000-0002-8814-9912; Soria, Juan/0000-0001-5249-8590; Munoz Colmenares, Manuel Eduardo/0000-0002-6506-529X													1386-2588	1573-5125				DEC	2021	55	4			SI		1143	1156		10.1007/s10452-021-09897-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-021-09897-8		SEP 2021											WOS:000694555100002

In general, simple approaches that neglect the spatial heterogeneity of watersheds impede understanding of the many processes occurring in these downstream aquatic ecosystems. In most cases, observed river discharges are used as the boundary condition for lake/reservoir modeling, which limits analyses of different situations and of areas that are ungauged or water bodies with little data available. Therefore, coupling hydrological models with hydrodynamic models seems to be a promising approach to allow one to understand how catchment features (e.g., land use, topography) and river discharges impact the dynamic patterns, including local circulation patterns, water levels and water quality in large water bodies in response to basin-wide forcing factors. In this study, we used a complex, spatially explicit, integrated approach to assess the hydrological responses to external forcing factors such as wind and river discharges, in the hydrodynamics of a large shallow subtropical lake. A large-scale integrated system composed of several sub-watersheds and a lake was analyzed by coupling a large-scale hydrological model with a hydrodynamic model. Our findings indicated that (i) the integrated model improved the capacity for representing the spatial and temporal variability of lake water-surface levels; (ii) the main hydrodynamic processes (water levels and flow structure) are controlled on a seasonal scale (months) by the river discharges, and on a short time scale (days) by wind influence (intensity and direction); and (iii) the modeling strategy allowed evaluation of anthropogenic stressors such as irrigation withdrawals on lake levels. This approach is an attempt to develop a physically based management model to simulate complex systems as a whole, allowing one to understand the main factors controlling the hydrodynamic processes and water levels, and accounting for internal (e.g., recirculation, horizontal mixing) and external factors (e.g., anthropogenic stressors, irrigation).					; Fan, Fernando/I-2421-2019	Bravo, Juan Martin/0000-0001-5585-1257; da Motta Marques, David/0000-0002-3809-8053; Munar, Andres Mauricio/0000-0003-2056-7234; Mainardi Fan, Fernando/0000-0003-0371-7851; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				SEP	2018	564						424	441		10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.07.045	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.07.045													WOS:000445316200035
J	Wang, XY; Gao, B				Wang, Xinyu; Gao, Bing			Frozen soil change and its impact on hydrological processes in the Qinghai Lake Basin, the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: The Qinghai Lake Basin, Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The Qinghai Lake is the largest inland saltwater lake in China. Study focus: Significant increase in runoff into the Qinghai Lake has been reported; however, the relationship between frozen soil changes and runoff remains poorly understood. This study investigated the temporal and spatial variations in frozen soil and associate effects on streamflow and soil moisture in the study region by a distributed eco-hydrological model. New hydrological insights: The results illustrate that the coverage of permafrost decreased by about 13% from 1971 to 2015, and permafrost degradation mainly occurred in the elevation interval of 3600-4200 m. The maximum frozen depth averaged in the seasonally frozen ground significantly decreased by 0.06 m/10a, while the active layer thickness averaged in the permafrost enhanced by 0.02 m/10a. Permafrost degradation caused enhanced soil liquid water storage and an increase in freezing season runoff. The increase in runoff in the thawing season was dominated by changes in precipitation. The results suggest that frozen soil degradation altered the seasonal flow regime, leading to lags in the monthly runoff peak, and it increased the base flow and reduced the thawing season runoff. This offset of the competing impacts of frozen soil changes in different seasons led to a negative effect on annual runoff. This study provides new understandings of cryospheric hydrological responses to climate change.																				2214-5818				FEB	2022	39								100993	10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.100993	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.100993		JAN 2022											WOS:000783312200001

CHANGE IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE SPORE-POLLEN SPECTRA ALONG THE ALTITUDE PROFILE IN THE RIVER BASIN OF AKTRU RIVER (CENTRAL ALTAI)	GEOSFERNYE ISSLEDOVANIYA-GEOSPHERE RESEARCH												The data of spore-pollen analysis of lacustrine, peat, and subaerial deposits are widely used in modern paleogeography for the reconstruction of past climates and landscapes of the Earth. However, if such reconstructions give reliable results for flat areas, then in mountainous regions, reconstructions based on paleopalynological data are difficult due to a non-linear relationship between the composition of spore-pollen spectra and the composition of the vegetation cover at the sampling site. Therefore, additional studies of processes of the spore-pollen spectra formation in mountainous areas are required to substantiate the strategy for interpretation of paleopalynological data from peat and lake deposits in mountain areas. The purpose of this work is to identify changes in the surface (subrecent) spore-pollen spectra collected along the altitudinal profile in the basin of the Aktru River (northern macroslope of the North-Chuysky Range, Central Altai). The range is characterized by typical for Altai Mts. vegetation zonation: the mountain-forest zone occupies a stripe of 1800-2300 m a.s.l. (meters above sea level), forest-tundra 2300-2500 m a.s.l., mountain-tundra - 2500-3050 m a.s.l. Steppe vegetation is widespread below 1800 m a.s.l. Above 2500 m a.s.l. there are alpine and glacial belts. The surface samples from 5 points (Fig. 1b) located at different hypsometric heights (samples No. 4-18 in Table and Fig. 4) were collected for palynological studies along altitudinal belt in the upper reaches of the Aktru River within its mountain-glacial basin. Between the extreme points of research in mountain-forest belt (points 1-5), the distance is about 2.2 km and the difference in height is 170 m. In addition, to characterize the higher (glacial) and lower (steppe) altitudinal zones a few literature samples were used. The main research method in this work was the spore-pollen analysis of surface (subrecent) samples (moss polsters and detrital litter). Additionally non pollen palynomorphs were counted, such as charcoal, shell amoebae, stomata, fungi. The qualitative and quantitative composition of subrecent pollen spectra we compared with local and regional vegetation. In addition to pollen, some types of non-pollen palynomorpth (charcoal, stomata, rhizopoda) were counted in the same samples. For analysis of pollen data we used ecological groping of pollen types. The study showed that a sequential series of pollen spectra from glaciers to the steppes of the Kurai depression quite adequately reflect the structure of altitudinal zones of local vegetation: at the highest points in the pollen spectra, the abundance of pollen from grasses and shrubs is increased; in the belt of mountain forests on the mountain slopes, the spectra are dominated by the pollen of woody plants with small proportion of pollen from grasses and shrubs; In the pollen spectra of steppe, the role of grass pollen again noticeably increases, and the abundance of shrub pollen becomes minimal. Long-distant pollen of Pinus sylvestris, Abies sibirica and Artemisia in the studied samples reflects the subregional and regional features of the vegetation cover of the Central Altai and Western Siberia. The pollen transport of these plant species is influenced both by local air currents (valley winds), which form differently in early and mid-summer, as well as by global air currents that dominate the territory of Northern Eurasia. Thus, pollen data of the surface (subrecent) samples taken along altitudinal profile in the Aktru River (Central Altai) showed that they carry information about local and regional vegetation, about local conditions of moisture, local anthropogenic impact on the landscape, and about global processes in the atmosphere.

The aim of this study was to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of groundwater chemistry and to identify the impact of natural and anthropogenic factors on the groundwater chemistry in the Subei Lake basin, Northwestern China. A total of 153 groundwater samples were collected and major ions were measured during the three campaigns (August and December 2013, May 2014). At present, the major hydrochemical fades in unconfined groundwater are Ca-Mg-HCO3, Ca-Na-HCO3, Na-Ca-HCO3, Na-HCO3, Ca-Mg-SO4 and Na-SO4-CI types, while the main hydrochemical fades in confined groundwater are Ca-Mg-HCO3, Ca-Na-HCO3, Na-Ca-HCO3, Ca-HCO3 and Na-HCO3 types. Relatively greater seasonal variation can be observed in the chemical constituents of confined groundwater than that of unconfined groundwater. Rock weathering predominates the evolution of groundwater chemistry in conjunction with the cation exchange, and the dissolution/precipitation of gypsum, halite, feldspar, calcite and dolomite are responsible for the chemical constituents of groundwater. Anthropogenic activities can be classified as: (1) groundwater overexploitation; (2) excessive application of fertilizers in agricultural areas. Due to intensive groundwater pumping, the accelerated groundwater mineralization resulted in the local changes in hydrochemical fades of unconfined groundwater, while the strong mixture, especially a large influx of downward leakage from the unconfined aquifer into the confined aquifer, played a vital role in thefundamental variation of hydrochemical facies in confined aquifer. The nitrate contamination is mainly controlled by the local hydrogeological settings coupled with the traditional flood irrigation. The deeper insight into geochemical evolution of groundwater obtained from this study can be beneficial to improving groundwater management for sustainable development in the rapidly industrialized areas.

Accurate monitoring of soil salinization and analysis of its main influencing factors are of great significance to the improvement and management of soil salinization. In this paper, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and salinity index (SI) were extracted from Landsat images of the Minqin oasis from 2000 to 2018, and these data were used to construct a soil salinization remote sensing monitoring index model (SDI). The index extracted by the model was used to monitor the soil salinization information, and the index values were graded to obtain different degrees of soil salinized land. The measured data were used to verify the accuracy of the SDI through trend analysis, stability analysis and other methods, and explore the characteristics and main influencing factors of soil salinization in the Minqin oasis. The results showed that the spatial distribution characteristics of the different degrees of soil salinity extracted by the SDI model were consistent with the measured results. The area of salinized soil in the Minqin oasis exceeded 80%, and the proportion of lightly salinized soil was the largest. The area ratio of salinized soil did not change much from 2000 to 2018, but the changes between different degrees of salinized soil were large.The unused land in the Minqin oasis exhibited a high degree of salinization, which was manifested spatially in the northwest of the Minqin oasis and the areas surrounding Qingtu Lake. In addition, the soil salinization of the Minqin oasis exhibited obvious seasonal differences, and the different degrees of salinization also changed with the change in seasons. The analysis of the main influencing factors of soil salinization in the Minqin oasis revealed that the large land occupation ratio of salinized land in the Minqin oasis was related to the local climatic factors. In recent years, changes in soil salinity in parts of the Minqin oasis and Qingtu Lake area were mainly the result of ecological water conveyance.

In this study, ammonia toxicity tests were performed using three aquatic organisms native to the Shaying River Basin (China). Published ammonia toxicity data with pH and temperature, and toxicity data acquired in this study were used to establish water quality criteria. The final criterion maximum concentration (CMC) and criterion continuous concentration (CCC) for the Shaying River Basin were 5.09 and 1.36 (mg total ammonia nitrogen (TAN))/L (pH 7 and 20 ?C), respectively. In addition, based on the corresponding relationship between ammonia toxicity and temperature and pH, the ecological risk assessment of ammonia was conducted in different seasons for the Shaying River using a tiered approach of both hazard quotient (HQ) and the joint probability (JPC) methods. Two methods gave consistent results: the ecological risks of ammonia to aquatic species in the Shaying River Basin were severe and the risk could be ranked as wet season > flat season > dry season. It is therefore indicating that monitoring, evaluation, and early warning of ammonia pollution need to be taken to prevent and control the risks posed by ammonia pollution, especially for wet season (because of high temperatures and pH) or flat season (because of high pH values). We hope the present work could provide valuable information to manage and control ammonia pollution in the Shaying River Basin.

J	Zhang, LQ; Xu, YJ; Li, SY				Zhang, Liuqing; Xu, Y. Jun; Li, Siyue			Changes in CO2 concentration and degassing of eutrophic urban lakes associated with algal growth and decline	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Urban lakes are numerous in the world, but their role in carbon storage and emission is not well understood. This study aimed to answer the critical questions: How does algal growing season influence carbon dioxide concentration (cCO2) and exchange flux (FCO2) in eutrophic urban lakes? We investigated trophic state, seasonality of algal productivity, and their association with CO2 dynamics in four urban lakes in Central China. We found that these lightly-to moderately-eutrophic urban lakes showed a shifting pattern of CO2 source-sink dynamics. In the non-algal bloom phase, the moderately-eutrophic lakes outgassed on average of 12.18 +/- 24.37 mmol m- 2 d-1 CO2; but, during the algal bloom phase, the lakes sequestered an average 1.07 +/- 6.22 mmol m- 2 d-1 CO2. The lightly-eutrophic lakes exhibited lower CO2 emission in the algal bloom (0.60 +/- 10.24 mmol m- 2 d-1) compared to the non-algal bloom (3.84 +/- 12.38 mmol m- 2 d-1). Biological factors such as Chl-a (chlorophyll a) and AOU (apparent oxygen utilization), were found to be important factors to potentially affect the shifting pattern of lake CO2 source-sink dynamics in moderately-eutrophic lakes, explaining 48% and 34% of the CO2 variation in the non-algal and algal bloom phases, respectively. Moreover, CO2 showed positive correlations with AOU, and negative correlations with Chl-a in both phases. In the lightly-eutrophic lakes, biological factors explained a higher proportion of CO2 variations (29%) in the non-algal bloom phase, with AOU accounting for 19%. Our results indicate that algal growth and decline phases largely affect dissolved CO2 level and exchange flux by regulating in-lake respiration and photosynthesis. Based on the findings, we conclude that shallow urban lakes can act as both sources and sinks of CO2, with algal growth seasonality and trophic state playing pivotal roles in controlling their carbon dynamics.

Knowledge of leachate composition is critical in risk assessment of long-term impact of landfills on human health and the environment as well as for prevention of negative outcomes. The research presented in this paper investigates the seasonal variation of draining leachate composition and resulting toxicity as well as the contamination status of soil/sediment from lagoon basins receiving leachates from landfill in Mpasa, a suburb of Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Samples were collected during the dry and rainy seasons and analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, soluble ions, toxic metals, and were then subjected to toxicity tests. Results highlight the significant seasonal difference in leachate physicochemical composition. Affected soil/sediment showed higher values for toxic metals than leachates, indicating the possibility of using lagoon system for the purification of landfill leachates, especially for organic matter and heavy metal sedimentation. However, the ecotoxicity tests demonstrated that leachates are still a significant source of toxicity for terrestrial and benthic organisms. Therefore, landfill leachates should not be discarded into the environment (soil or surface water) without prior treatment. Interest in the use of macrophytes in lagoon system is growing and toxic metal retention in lagoon basin receiving systems needs to be fully investigated in the future. This study presents useful tools for evaluating landfill leachate quality and risk in lagoon systems which can be applied to similar environmental compartments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the living of the benthic fish like large-scale tongue sole (Cynoglossus arel) on the seafloor, toxicants are more accumulated in their bodies. Therefore, the accumulation of some heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, and Zn) was determined in the edible tissues of this fish species captured from Chabahar Bay located in the northern shores of the Gulf of Oman, as well as in the sediment of their environment. For this purpose, thirty fish samples and sediment from five stations were collected during wet and dry seasons. The preparation of samples was done based on standard procedures, and the concentration of metals was measured by a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Besides conventional statistical analysis, Muller's index (I-geo) for the classification of contamination and the biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) were calculated. Results showed that the sediment of Chabahar Bay was classified as moderately contaminated in terms of Ni (I-geo = 1.271) and Pb (I-geo = 1.019). A significant correlation was found between the levels of Ni (18.1 mu g center dot g(-1)) in sediments and bio-concentration of Cu (4.85 mu g center dot g(-1)), Ni, (0.591 mu g center dot g(-1)) and Pb (1.2 mu g center dot g(-1)) in fish tissues (p < 0.05). In conclusion, Pb content accumulated in fish or sediment was the most important from the health view.

Land-use influence on the functional organization of Afrotropical macroinvertebrate assemblages	LIMNOLOGICA												Studies investigating the effects of human activities on the functional organization of macroinvertebrate communities in tropical streams and rivers are very limited, despite these areas witnessing the greatest loss of natural forests globally. We investigated changes in taxon richness, numerical abundance and biomass of macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups (FFGs) in streams draining different land-use types in the SosianiKipkaren River in western Kenya. Twenty-one sites in river reaches categorized as forested, mixed, urban or agricultural were sampled during the dry and wet seasons. Collected macroinvertebrates were identified to the lowest taxon possible (mainly genus) and classified into five major FFGs; collector-gatherers, collector-filterers, scrapers, predators and shredders. There were significant (p < 0.05) spatial variation in habitat quality, organic matter standing stocks, total suspended solids, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, temperature and nutrient concentrations across land-uses, with forested sites recording lowest values in mean water temperature, electrical conductivity and nutrients while recording highest levels in dissolved oxygen concentrations. Responses in macroinvertebrates to changes in land-use varied with richness, abundance and biomass showing differences within FFGs. Biomass-based metrics responded more strongly to change in land-use while taxon richness was the least predictive, indicating replacement of taxa within FFGs across land-use types. Higher shredder abundance, biomass and richness were recorded in forested streams which were cooler with protected riparian areas and high biomass of coarse particulate organic matter. Collector-gatherers dominated agricultural and urban streams owing to an abundance of particulate organic matter and nutrients, while scrapers responded positively to increased nutrient levels and open canopy in mixed and agricultural streams where primary production and algal biomass was likely increased. Overall, this study provides further evidence of the effects of agricultural and urban land-uses on tropical streams and rivers and contributes to the use of macroinvertebrate FFGs as indicators of ecological health.

To quantify surface water changes and factors driving them, long-term surface water variation in Dongting Lake was investigated using the multiple spectral indices method based on a decision tree classification for full time-series Landsat and MODIS datasets. Factors influencing surface water changes were explored by combining the annual maximum surface water and annual permanent occurrent water with meteorological and hydrological data. The results showed that both annual maximum surface water and annual permanent water decreased from 1975 to 2019 and the trends of rainfall and runoff at three outlets also changed. The annual maximum surface water surface of Dongting Lake increased during the 1990s due to high rainfall but decreased again after 2000. A significant change in both the hydrological stage and surface water sequence from 1986 to 2019 occurred in 2003, which coincided with the beginning of work to construct the Three Gorges Dam (TGD). The surface water decreased by about 360 km(2) and runoff at the three outlets decreased by about 150 x 10(8) m(3) after the impoundment of the TGD, which was likely the main cause of surface water changes after 2003. The area of surface water that changed from permanent water in the pre-TGD period into seasonally occurring water in the post-TGD periods is 209 km(2), while the area of surface water that changed from seasonally occurring water in the pre-TGD period into permanent occurrent water in the post-TGD period is 31 km(2). Meteorological elements and human activities have had a comprehensive impact on surface water changes in Dongting Lake. Rainfall and temperature account for about one-third of the influence on long-term changes of surface water, and rainfall is the main meteorological driving factor of surface water in the wet season, while temperature is the main factor in the dry season. Runoff at three outlets, four rivers and the Chenglingji explain about half of the change in surface water; the three outlets runoff is mainly affected by human activities and is the main hydrological driving factor of surface water. The monthly maximum surface water fluctuates regularly and Dongting Lake has a strong seasonal characteristic. Indeed, the seasonal changes are significantly altered when drought or flooding occurs, the causes of which are diverse and complex.																				2072-4292				MAY	2021	13	9							1827	10.3390/rs13091827	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13091827													WOS:000650742100001

ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Silver-based nanoparticles (Ag-b-NPs) emitted by wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are considered to be widely present in the natural environment. However, there is much that is unknown about the effect of WWTP effluent on the occurrence of Ag-b-NPs in surface waters. On the basis of field analysis of representative WWTPs in Germany, we demonstrate that more than 96.4% of Ag-b-NPs from wastewater influent are removed through WWTPs, even though influent contains Ag-b-NP concentrations of tens to hundreds ng L-1, resulting in effluent Ag-b-NP concentrations of 0.7-11.1 ng L-1 over the seasons. The estimated flux of Ag-b-NPs associated with WWTPs effluent discharge is similar to 33 kg y(-1) in Germany. WWTPs effluent increases Ag-b-NP levels of the River Isar to 2.0-8.6 ng L-1 while remarkable decreases are observed at sites similar to 1.5 km downstream of each discharge point, and Ag-b-NP levels then keep stable (0.9-2.3 ng L-1) until the next discharge point, showing subtle differences in Ag-b-NP levels between the river and reference lakes without industrial sources and WWTPs effluent discharge. Our results demonstrate that WWTPs effluent can exert a clear influence on the occurrence of Ag-b-NPs in surface waters.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				JUN 21	2016	50	12					6327	6333		10.1021/acs.est.6b00694	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.6b00694								27228366					WOS:000378469900026

A parallel field experiment was performed to measure annual CH4 and N2O fluxes from rice paddies and rice paddy-converted inland crab-fish aquaculture wetlands in southeast China. Besides N2O fluxes dependent on water/sediment mineral N and CH4 fluxes related to water chemical oxygen demand, both CH4 and N2O fluxes from aquaculture were related to water/sediment temperature, sediment dissolved organic carbon, and water dissolved oxygen concentration. Annual CH4 and N2O fluxes from inland aquaculture averaged 0.37 mg m(-2) h(-1) and 48.1 mu g m(-2) h(-1), yielding 32.57 kg ha(-1) and 2.69 kg N2O-N ha(-1), respectively. The conversion of rice paddies to aquaculture significantly reduced CH4 and N2O emissions by 48% and 56%, respectively. The emission factor for N2O was estimated to be 0.66% of total N input in the feed or 1.64 g N2O-N kg(-1) aquaculture production in aquaculture. The conversion of rice paddies to inland aquaculture would benefit for reconciling greenhouse gas mitigation and agricultural income increase as far as global warming potentials and net ecosystem economic profits are of concomitant concern. Some agricultural practices such as better aeration and feeding, and fallow season dredging would help to lower CH4 and N2O emissions from inland aquaculture. More field measurements from inland aquaculture are highly needed to gain an insight into national and global accounting of CH4 and N2O emissions.

The streamflow depth increased at a rate of 2.5 mm/a since 2000. Quantification of the water contribution brought by permafrost thawing is a difficult task. In this study, we used Sentinel-1 data and the SBAS-InSAR technique to monitor terrain deformation from September 2016 to December 2021, and then utilized the long-term deformation rate to assess ground ice meltwater release and the seasonal deformation to evaluate water storage in the active layer. Results reveal that 55.3% of the terrain in the SRYR has subsidence >2.5 mm/a, indicating widespread ground ice melting. The release rate of ground ice meltwater is 4.3 mm/a in the entire SRYR, above 6 mm/a at the Dangqu and Tuotuo River subbasins. The water release rate is relatively small (similar to 3%) in comparison to the streamflow depth of 151 mm per year during the investigation period of 2017-2021. We did not detect a strong increasing or decreasing trend among the 5-year seasonal deformation, which reflects that the total soil water content in the active layer did not change significantly during the short investigation period. The results provide a data basis for ground ice richness and loss information in the SRYR and help to understand the impact of permafrost thawing on the regional water cycle in the permafrost environment.					; zhao, lin/M-9536-2018; Zhao, Lin/M-9536-2018; Hu, Guojie/M-5738-2019; Wang, Lingxiao/KOC-2800-2024	Wang, Lingxiao/0000-0003-2081-1022; zhao, lin/0000-0003-0245-8413; Du, Erji/0000-0003-2878-2051; Hu, Guojie/0000-0002-5428-0445; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				DEC	2023	59	12							e2023WR034451	10.1029/2023WR034451	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023WR034451													WOS:001113338400001

Effects of climate change on river-ice processes and ice jams	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT												As the climate changes, ice characteristics and river-ice processes are altered, sometimes in unexpected ways. A warmer climate will obviously result in less ice globally, and in a general northward shift in the limits of seasonal river-ice occurrence. However, in several watersheds, the frequency of midwinter breakup events and the intensity of breakup ice jams may also change. In addition, climate change will alter other river-ice processes such as ice formation, freeze-up jams, and hanging dams. This is of concern during the design and construction of infrastructure as well as during the planning and implementation of flood-damage-reduction measures in and along rivers with seasonal ice covers. Changes in river-ice regimes will also alter the ecology of many lotic systems. The paper reviews the potential effects of a changing climate on river-ice properties and processes, and provides a discussion of future outcomes and their significance, as well as a suggested direction for future cold-regions river research.																			1571-5124	1814-2060				JUL 3	2023	21	3					421	441		10.1080/15715124.2021.2007936	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15715124.2021.2007936		FEB 2022											WOS:000758089400001

Basin-wide surveys of the three GHGs were combined with a small number of measurements of C isotope ratios in dissolved organic matter (DOM), CO2, and CH4 in the Han River basin, South Korea, to examine how longitudinal patterns of the three gases and DOM are affected by four cascade dams along a middle section of the North Han River (hereafter termed "middle reach") and treated wastewater discharged to the lower Han River ("lower reach") traversing the Seoul metropolitan area. Monthly monitoring and two-season comparison were conducted at 6 and 15 sites, respectively, to measure surface water gas concentrations and ancillary water quality parameters including concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and optical properties of DOM. The basin-wide surveys were complemented with a sampling cruise along the lower reach and synoptic samplings along an urban tributary delivering effluents from a large wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) to the lower reach. The levels of pCO(2) were relatively low in the middle reach (51-2465 mu atm), particularly at the four dam sites (51-761 mu atm), compared with those found in the largely forested upper basin with scattered patches of croplands (163-2539 mu atm), the lower reach (78-11298 mu atm), and three urban tributaries (2120-11970 mu atm). The upper and middle reaches displayed generally low concentration ranges of CH4 and N2O, with some local peaks influenced by agricultural runoff and impoundments. By comparison, the lower reach exhibited exceptionally high concentrations of CH4 (1.2-15766 nmol L-1 / and N2O (7.5-1396 nmol L-1), which were significantly correlated with different sets of variables such as DO and PO43- for CH4 and NH C-4(+) and NO3- for N2O. Downriver increases in the levels of DOC and optical properties such as fluorescence index (FI) and protein-like fluorescence indicated an increasing DOM fraction of anthropogenic and microbial origin. The concentrations of the three GHGs and DOC were similar in magnitude and temporal variation at a WWTP discharge and the receiving tributary, indicating a disproportionate contribution of the WWTP effluents to the tributary gas and DOC exports to the lower reach. The values of delta C-13 in surface water CO2 and CH4 measured during the sampling cruise along the lower reach, combined with delta C-13 and Delta C-14 in DOM sampled across the basin, implied a strong influence of the wastewater-derived gases and aged DOM delivered by the urban tributaries. The downstream enrichment of C-13 in CO2 and CH4 suggested that the spatial distribution of these gases across the eutrophic lower reach may also be constrained by multiple concomitant processes including outgassing, photosynthesis, and CH4 oxidation. The overall results suggest that dams and urban wastewater may create longitudinal discontinuities in riverine metabolic processes leading to large spatial variations in the three GHGs correlating with different combinations of DOM properties and nutrients. Further research is required to evaluate the relative contributions of anthropogenic and in-stream sources of the three gases and DOM in eutrophic urbanized river systems and constrain key factors for the contrasting impoundment effects such as autotrophy-driven decreases in pCO(2) and in-lake production of CH4 and N2O.					; Yoon, Tae Kyung/AAL-5227-2020; Kang, Namgoo/N-2353-2017; Begum, Most Shirina/AAI-7349-2021	Yoon, Tae Kyung/0000-0003-0627-0135; Begum, Most Shirina/0000-0001-5214-1153; Park, Ji-Hyung/0000-0002-9083-2630; 													1726-4170	1726-4189				OCT 26	2018	15	20					6349	6369		10.5194/bg-15-6349-2018	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-6349-2018													WOS:000448811900008

How are subaqueous sediment density flows triggered, what is their internal structure and how does it evolve? Direct observations from monitoring of active flows	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Subaqueous sediment density flows are one of the volumetrically most important processes for moving sediment across our planet, and form the largest sediment accumulations on Earth (submarine fans). They are also arguably the most sparely monitored major sediment transport processes on our planet. Significant advances have been made in documenting their timing and triggers, especially within submarine canyons and delta-fronts, and freshwater lakes and reservoirs, but the sediment concentration of flows that run out beyond the continental slope has never been measured directly. This limited amount of monitoring data contrasts sharply with other major types of sediment flow, such as river systems, and ensure that understanding submarine sediment density flows remains a major challenge for Earth science. The available monitoring data define a series of flow types whose character and deposits differ significantly. Large (>100 km(3)) failures on the continental slope can generate fast-moving (up to 19 m/s) flows that reach the deep ocean, and deposit thick layers of sand across submarine fans. Even small volume (0.008 km(3)) canyon head failures can sometimes generate channelised flows that travel at >5 m/s for several hundred kilometres. A single event off SE Taiwan shows that river floods can generate powerful flows that reach the deep ocean, in this case triggered by failure of recently deposited sediment in the canyon head. Direct monitoring evidence of powerful oceanic flows produced by plunging hyperpycnal flood water is lacking, although this process has produced shorter and weaker oceanic flows. Numerous flows can occur each year on river-fed delta fronts, where they can generate up-slope migrating crescentic bedforms. These flows tend to occur during the flood season, but are not necessarily associated with individual flood discharge peaks, suggesting that they are often triggered by delta-front slope failures. Powerful flows occur several times each year in canyons fed by sand from the shelf, associated with strong wave action. These flows can also generate up-slope migrating crescentic bedforms that most likely originate due to retrogressive breaching associated with a dense near-bed layer of sediment. Expanded dilute flows that are supercritical and fully turbulent are also triggered by wave action in canyons. Sediment density flows in lakes and reservoirs generated by plunging river flood water have been monitored in much greater detail. They are typically very dilute (<0.01 vol.% sediment) and travel at <50 cm/s, and are prone to generating interflows within the density stratified freshwater. A key objective for future work is to develop measurement techniques for seeing through overlying dilute clouds of sediment, to determine whether dense near-bed layers are present. There is also a need to combine monitoring of flows with detailed analyses of flow deposits, in order to understand how flows are recorded in the rock record. Finally, a source-to-sink approach is needed because the character of submarine flows can change significantly along their flow path. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The project has ramifications for hydrological con-nectivity and biogeochemical cycling of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in regional lakes affected by the project. We carried out an extensive field sampling campaign along the SNWDP-ER in different hydrological seasons of 2018 and monthly observations in Lake Hongze and Lake Luoma from April 2018 to June 2021. We found the lakes connecting to the SNWDP-ER had higher mean DOC, specific UV absorbance, higher ratio of humic-like to protein-like fluorophores (Humic : Protein), and shallower spectral slope (S275-295) in the wet season compared to the wet-to-dry transition, and dry seasons. The southern lakes and Yangtze River had lower DOC concen-tration, bioavailable DOC (BDOC), and higher DOM aromaticity compared to the northern two downstream lakes. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) revealed higher relative abundance of CHO-containing and aromatic compounds in the Yangtze River and the southern three upstream lakes compared to the northern two lakes. The data from Lake Hongze and Lake Luoma, studied in different hydrological seasons, suggest that water delivery had high consistency in DOM composition and BDOC over the season. We conclude that positioning along the watercourse and seasonally variable hydrological conditions play an important role in influencing the DOM composition and bioavailability of key lakes connecting to the SNWDP-ER. Our results indicated that the water diversion project delivers water with low DOC concentration and higher aromaticity and thus is of higher quality since it has higher DOM removal potential during drinking water treatment.

Niche partitioning among frugivorous fishes in response to fluctuating resources in the Amazonian floodplain forest	ECOLOGY												In response to temporal changes in the quality and availability of food resources, consumers should adjust their foraging behavior in a manner that maximizes energy and nutrient intake and, when resources are limiting, minimizes dietary overlap with other consumers. Floodplains of the Amazon and its lowland tributaries are characterized by strong, yet predictable, hydrological seasonality, seasonal availability of fruits, seeds, and other food resources of terrestrial origin, and diverse assemblages of frugivorous fishes, including morphologically similar species of several characiform families. Here, we investigated how diets of frugivorous fishes in the Amazon change in response to fluctuations in food availability, and how this influences patterns of interspecific dietary overlap. We tested predictions from classical theories of foraging and resource competition by estimating changes in diet breadth and overlap across seasons. We monitored fruiting phenology to assess food availability, and surveyed local fish populations during three hydrological seasons in an oligotrophic river and an adjacent oxbow lake in the Colombian Amazon. We analyzed stomach contents and stable isotope data to evaluate temporal and interspecific relationships for dietary composition, breadth, and overlap. Diets of six species of characiform fishes representing three genera changed according to seasonal fluctuations in food availability, and patterns of diet breadth and interspecific overlap during the peak flood pulse were consistent with predictions of optimal foraging theory. During times of high fruit abundance, fishes consumed items to which their functional morphological traits seemed best adapted, potentially enhancing net energy and nutritional gains. As the annual flood pulse subsided and availability of forest food resources in aquatic habitats changed, there was not a consistent pattern of diet breadth expansion or compression. Nonetheless, shifts in both diet composition and stable isotope ratios of consumer tissues during this period resulted in trophic niche segregation in a pattern consistent with competition theory.

This study calculated the national aquatic life criteria for ammonia in China. The temporal and spatial distri-butions were investigated and the multi-tier ecological risks were assessed for ammonia and un-ionized ammonia (NH3) during 2014-2018 based on a total of 18989 ammonia monitoring data from 110 monitoring sites in seven river basins. The sensitivity comparison of different species taxa to ammonia showed that Perciformes fish should be listed as a priority protected species in the derivation of ammonia criteria. The participation of introduced aquaculture species have no significant impact on the final criteria values (t-test, p > 0.05). The final criterion maximum concentration (CMC) and criterion continuous concentration (CCC) were 10.24 and 3.31 mg/L for ammonia (pH 7.0 and 20 degrees C). The interannual variation showed that decreasing trends were observed for ammonia and NH3 pollutions in the past five years. However, the increasing trends were observed for ammonia in Liao River basin, for NH3 in Yangtze River and Pearl River basins (2014-2018). The significant seasonal and geographical differences of ammonia and NH3 pollution were found. Moreover, the pollutions of ammonia and NH3 in some monitoring points of Huai River, Yellow River and Songhua River basins at the provincial borders were significant. The result of ecological risk assessment showed that the average exceedance probability for 5% affected species by NH3 in long-term exposure was 28.96% in the past five years.

Although previous studies have explored how environmental changes influence microbial functioning in the water-level-fluctuating zone, few studies have investigated how wholescale habitat changes affect microbial composition, community stability and ecological functions in lake environments. To address this issue, our study investigated the effects of sediment-to-soil conversion on microbial composition, community stability and subsequent ecological functioning in Poyang Lake, China. Our results revealed that, during sediment-to-soil conversion, the number of total and unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs) decreased by 40 % and 55 %, respectively. Moreover, sediment-to-soil conversion decreased the microbial community connectivity and complexity while significantly increasing its stability, as evidenced by increased absolute values of negative/ positive cohesion. In sediment and soil, the abundance of dominant bacteria, and bacterial diversity strongly affected microbial community stability, although this phenomenon was not true in water. Furthermore, the specific microbial phyla and genes involved in the nitrogen cycle changed significantly following sediment-to soil conversion, with the major nitrogen cycling processes altering from denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium to nitrification and assimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia. Moreover, a compensation mechanism was observed in the functional genes related to the nitrogen cycle, such that all the processes in the nitrogen cycle were maintained following sediment-to-soil conversion. The oxidation-reduction potential strongly affected network complexity, microbial stability, and nitrogen cycling in the sediment and soil. These results aid in the understanding of responses of microorganisms to climate change and extreme drought. Our findings have considerable implications for predicting the ecological consequences of habitat conversion and for ecosystem management.

H.; Olago, Daniel O.; Odada, Eric O.; Mulch, Andreas; Musolff, Andreas			Groundwater fluoride enrichment in an active rift setting: Central Kenya Rift case study	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Groundwater is used extensively in the Central Kenya Rift for domestic and agricultural demands. In these active rift settings groundwater can exhibit high fluoride levels. In order to address water security and reduce human exposure to high fluoride in drinking water, knowledge of the source and geochemical processes of enrichment are required. A study was therefore carried out within the Naivasha catchment (Kenya) to understand the genesis, enrichment and seasonal variations of fluoride in the groundwater. Rocks, rain, surface and groundwater sources were sampled for hydrogeochemical and isotopic investigations, the data was statistically and geospatially analyzed. Water sources have variable fluoride concentrations between 0.02-75 mg/L. 73% exceed the health limit (1.5 mg/L) in both dry and wet seasons. F-concentrations in rivers are lower (0.2-9.2 mg/L) than groundwater (0.09 to 43.6 mg/L) while saline lake waters have the highest concentrations (0.27-75 mg/L). The higher values are confined to elevations below 2000 masl. Oxygen (delta O-18) and hydrogen (delta D) isotopic values range from - 6.2 to + 5.8% and -31.3 to + 33.3%, respectively, they are also highly variable in the rift floor where they attain maximum values. Fluoride base levels in the precursor vitreous volcanic rocks are higher (between 3750-6000 ppm) in minerals such as cordierite and muscovite while secondary minerals like illite and kaolinite have lower remnant fluoride (<1000 ppm). Thus, geochemical F-enrichment in regional groundwater is mainly due to a) rock alteration, i.e. through long residence times and natural discharge and/or enhanced leakages of deep seated geothermal water reservoirs, b) secondary concentration fortification of natural reservoirs through evaporation, through reduced recharge and/or enhanced abstraction and c) through additional enrichment of fluoride after volcanic emissions. The findings are useful to help improve water management in Naivasha as well as similar active rift setting environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Evaluation of potable groundwater zones identification based on WQI and GIS techniques in Adyar River basin, Chennai, Tamilnadu, India	ACTA ECOLOGICA SINICA												The main objective of this study is to identify the potable groundwater zones in Adyar River Basin (ARB) that forms the major river of Chennai metropolitan and significantly contributes to the demands of this big city's water supply. Twenty eight groundwater samples were collected during postmonsoon and premonsoon seasons in 2016 from the wells of ARB which is downstream of Chembarambakkam Lake, which supplies drinking water to Chennai metropolitan city. All the water samples were analyzed using Portable meter and Ion Chromatography for physico-chemical parameters and major ions such as pH, TDS, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, HCO3, SO4 and NO3. The analytical results were compared with the WHO, USEPA & BIS guideline values and reported that some of the samples exceeds these guideline values for drinking water quality. Spatial distribution maps were prepared to identify the potable groundwater available regions based on these water quality parameters. Piper and Gibbs plots are generated to identify the nature and type of groundwater with processes controls the groundwater chemistry. Principal component analysis was done to interpret the possible sources of chemical compounds present in the groundwater. To precisely delineate the potable groundwater region in ARB, Water Quality Index (WQI) approach is employed with the basic water quality parameters and spatial distribution maps were prepared using GIS for the obtained indexes. It is found that only 10.71% and 17.86% of the study area groundwater is within the excellent water quality for drinking during postmonsoon and premonsoon respectively, whereas 42.86% in postmonsoon and 14.29% in premonsoon is found as poor quality groundwater for drinking. The groundwater of the northwestern and western part of ARB is under very poor and unsuitable category for drinking in both the seasons. This region of ARB is recommended for implementation of artificial groundwater recharging to improve the groundwater quality and make it suitable for drinking.(c) 2020 Ecological Society of China.

J	Ficker, H; Luger, M; Gassner, H				Ficker, Harald; Luger, Martin; Gassner, Hubert			From dimictic to monomictic: Empirical evidence of thermal regime transitions in three deep alpine lakes in Austria induced by climate change	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Duration and timing of thermal stratification and the period of vertical mixing are crucial for internal chemical and biological processes of deep temperate lakes. Climatic changes induced a prolongation of thermal stratification in many lakes over the last decades. This study provides a comparative assessment of observed climate-induced changes in thermal and limnological properties of three originally dimictic temperate lakes. We analysed 41years of vertical sampling data of Lake Irrsee (IR), Mondsee (MO) and Hallstatter See (HA) located in the Salzkammergut lake district of Austria. We examined temperatures in surface and bottom waters, quantified changes in thermal regimes and investigated the development of hypoxia,anoxia and phosphorus concentrations of the three lakes from 1975 to 2015. Mean annual surface-water temperatures increased substantially, whereas bottom-water temperatures showed insignificant trends in IR and MO and a slight rising trend in HA. Resulting higher vertical temperature gradients caused stronger thermal stabilities of the lakes. Based on calculations of daily thermal stability, all three lakes showed a significant prolongation of the stratification period with +31days (7days) in IR, +37days (7days) in MO and +28 (+/- 8days) in HA. We observed greater changes in the timing of onset of stratification compared to the changes in the timing of stratification termination (IR onset -19days versus termination +11days, MO onset -21days versus termination +16days, HA onset -16days versus termination +12days). We found that expanding seasonal hypoxia and anoxia were correlated to prolonged seasonal stratifications and to increasing phosphorus concentrations inbottom-water layers. However, higher phosphorus concentrations in bottomwaters did not raise the lakes volume-weighted total phosphorus concentrations. Under ongoing climate change, alterations in the thermal characteristics will inevitably lead to a transition of mixing regimes from a dimictic to a monomictic mixing pattern in originally ice-covered temperate lakes. Our investigation revealed that this transition will be earlier in larger and deeper lakes.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	2017	62	8					1335	1345		10.1111/fwb.12946	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12946													WOS:000405074600003

Methane oxidation coupled to oxygenic photosynthesis in anoxic waters	ISME JOURNAL												Freshwater lakes represent large methane sources that, in contrast to the Ocean, significantly contribute to non-anthropogenic methane emissions to the atmosphere. Particularly mixed lakes are major methane emitters, while permanently and seasonally stratified lakes with anoxic bottom waters are often characterized by strongly reduced methane emissions. The causes for this reduced methane flux from anoxic lake waters are not fully understood. Here we identified the microorganisms and processes responsible for the near complete consumption of methane in the anoxic waters of a permanently stratified lake, Lago di Cadagno. Interestingly, known anaerobic methanotrophs could not be detected in these waters. Instead, we found abundant gamma-proteobacterial aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria active in the anoxic waters. In vitro incubations revealed that, among all the tested potential electron acceptors, only the addition of oxygen enhanced the rates of methane oxidation. An equally pronounced stimulation was also observed when the anoxic water samples were incubated in the light. Our combined results from molecular, biogeochemical and single-cell analyses indicate that methane removal at the anoxic chemocline of Lago di Cadagno is due to true aerobic oxidation of methane fuelled by in situ oxygen production by photosynthetic algae. A similar mechanism could be active in seasonally stratified lakes and marine basins such as the Black Sea, where light penetrates to the anoxic chemocline. Given the widespread occurrence of seasonally stratified anoxic lakes, aerobic methane oxidation coupled to oxygenic photosynthesis might have an important but so far neglected role in methane emissions from lakes.					; Lam, Phyllis/D-9574-2011; Littmann, Sten/D-2646-2011; Schubert, Carsten/GQQ-1673-2022	Littmann, Sten/0000-0001-8685-5357; Lam, Phyllis/0000-0003-2067-171X; Schubert, Carsten J./0000-0003-1668-5967; 													1751-7362	1751-7370				SEP	2015	9	9					1991	2002		10.1038/ismej.2015.12	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ismej.2015.12								25679533					WOS:000360019500008

Using long-term Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery and field observation data in eutrophic Lake Taihu, we developed a novel approach to estimate the concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide (cCO(2)) in lakes. Based on the MODIS-derived chlorophyll-a concentration, lake surface temperature, diffuse attenuation coefficient of photosynthetically active radiation, and photosynthetically active radiation, a spatially explicit cCO(2) model was developed using multivariate quadratic polynomial regression (coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.84, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 11.81 mu mol L-1, unbiased percent difference (UPD) = 22.46%). Monte Carlo simulations indicated that the model is stable with relatively small deviations in cCO(2) estimates caused by input variables (UPD = 26.14%). MODIS data from 2003 to 2018 showed a significant declining trend (0.42 mu mol L-1 yr(-1), p < 0.05) in the annual mean cCO(2). This was associated with a complex balance between the increasing algae biomass and decreasing external inputs of inorganic carbon, nutrients, and organic matter. The high spatiotemporal variabilities in cCO(2) were attributed to river inputs and seasonal changes in temperature and algae biomass. The study shows that satellite remote sensing can play an important role in the field of inland water carbon cycling, providing timely much-needed insights into the drivers of the spatial and temporal changes in dissolved CO2 concentrations in inland waters.

Moreover, previous epidemiology studies highlighted a relationship between cyanotoxins in drinking water with liver cancer and damage and colorectal cancer. These associations identified cyanobacterial blooms as a global public health and environmental problem, affecting freshwater bodies that are important sources for drinking water, agriculture, and aquafarms. Furthermore, as a result of climate change, it is expected that our freshwater environments will become more favorable for producing harmful blooms that produce various cyanotoxins. Food is an important source of cyanotoxin exposure to humans, but it has been less addressed. This paper synthesizes information from the studies that have investigated cyanotoxins in freshwater and food on a global scale. We also review and summarize the health effects and exposure routes of cyanotoxins and candidates for cyanotoxin treatment methods that can be applied to food.

Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Water Hyacinth and Its Linkage with Lake-Level Fluctuation: Lake Tana, a Sub-Humid Region of the Ethiopian Highlands	WATER												Water hyacinth originated from the Amazon Basin and has expanded to other parts of the world since the 1800s. In Ethiopia, the weed is affecting the socio-economic activities of the people whose livelihood is directly or indirectly dependent on Lake Tana. Still, the area covered by water hyacinth and the impact of water level fluctuation on the expansion of water hyacinth has not been known clearly. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to determine the spatiotemporal distribution of water hyacinth and relation with lake-level fluctuation. The area covered by water hyacinth was determined using monthly Sentinel-2 images, which were collected from November 2015 to December 2019. The impact of water level fluctuation on the expansion of water hyacinth was evaluated using hourly water level data converted to a monthly average to correlate with the area covered by the water hyacinth. In addition, MOD13Q1.006 data was used to evaluate the trend of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and its linkage with the weed. The maximum areas covered by water hyacinth were 278.3, 613.6, 1108.7, 2036.5, and 2504.5 ha in Feb 2015, October 2016, September 2017, December 2018, and in December 2019, respectively. Its areal coverage was declining from the northern corridors and increasing in eastern shores of the lake. The lake-level fluctuation was observed in the range of 1.5 to 3.98 m in this study. The annual mean maximum spatial values of the NDVI were in the range of 0.27 and 0.47. The area covered by water hyacinth was increasing significantly (P < 0.05) and positively correlated with the seasonal lake-level fluctuation. High water level enabled the expansion of the weed by extending its suitable habitat of shallow water to the flood plain. Based on the results of this study, lake-level fluctuations can have an adverse impact on the expansion of the weed.					; Mhiret, Demesew/KUC-9862-2024; Worqlul, Abeyou/I-1788-2019; Abebe, Wubneh Belete/GXG-2437-2022; Melesse, Assefa/F-9931-2013; Abebe, wubneh/E-7774-2019; Tilahun, Seifu/ABE-2501-2020	Gitaw, Minychl/0000-0003-2778-6210; wale worqlul, abeyou/0000-0002-7990-8446; Alemaw Mhiret, Demesew/0000-0002-6318-3612; Abebe, Wubneh Belete/0000-0003-2072-7146; Melesse, Assefa/0000-0003-4724-9367; 														2073-4441				MAY	2020	12	5							1435	10.3390/w12051435	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12051435													WOS:000555915200214

A 24,000-year ancient DNA and pollen record from the Polar Urals reveals temporal dynamics of arctic and boreal plant communities	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A 24,000-year record of plant community dynamics, based on pollen and ancient DNA from the sediments (sedaDNA) of Lake Bolshoye Shchuchye in the Polar Ural Mountains, provides detailed information on the flora of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and also changes in plant community composition and dominance. It greatly improves on incomplete records from short and fragmented stratigraphic sequences found in exposed sedimentary sections in the western Russian Arctic. In total, 162 plant taxa were detected by sedaDNA and 115 by pollen analysis. Several shifts in dominance between and within plant functional groups occurred over the studied period, but most taxa appear to have survived in situ. A diverse arctic-alpine herb flora characterised the interval ca. 24,000-17,000 cal years BP and persisted into the Holocene. Around 17,000 cal years BP, sedges (e.g. Carex) and bryophytes (e.g. Bryum, Aulacomnium) increased. The establishment of shrub-tundra communities of Dryas and Vaccinium sp., with potentially some Betula pubescens trees (influx similar to 290 grains cm(2) year(-1)) followed at ca. 15,000 cal years BP. Forest taxa such as Picea and ferns (e.g. Dryopteris fragrans, Gymnocarpium dryopteris) established near the lake from ca. 10,000 cal years BP, followed by the establishment of Larix trees from ca. 9000 cal years BP. Picea began to decline from ca. 7000 cal years BP. A complete withdrawal of forest tree taxa occurred by ca. 4000 cal years BP, presumably due to decreasing growing-season temperatures, allowing the expansion of dwarf-shrub tundra and a diverse herb community similar to the present-day vegetation mosaic. Contrary to some earlier comparative studies, sedaDNA and pollen from Lake Bolshoye Shchuchye showed high similarity in the timing of compositional changes and the occurrence of key plant taxa. The sedaDNA record revealed several features that the pollen stratigraphy and earlier palaeorecords in the region failed to detect; a sustained, long-term increase in floristic richness since the LGM until the early Holocene, turnover in grass and forb genera over the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, persistence of a diverse arctic-alpine flora over the late Quaternary, and a variable bryophyte flora through time. As pollen records are often limited by taxonomic resolution, differential productivity and dispersal, sedaDNA can provide improved estimates of floristic richness and is better able to distinguish between different plant assemblages. However, pollen remains superior at providing quantitative estimates of plant abundance changes and detecting several diverse groups (e.g. Poaceae, Cyperaceae, Asteraceae) which may be underreported in the sedaDNA. Joint use of the two proxies provided unprecedented floristic detail of past plant communities and helped to distinguish between long-distance transport of pollen and local presence, particularly for woody plant taxa.

Seasonal variations in arsenic mobility and bacterial diversity: The case study of Huangshui Creek, Shimen Realgar Mine, Hunan Province, China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Rivers throughout the world have been contaminated by arsenic dispersed from mining activities. The biogeochemical cycling of this arsenic has been shown to be due to factors such as pH, Eh, ionic strength and microbial activity, but few studies have examined the effects of both seasonal changes and microbial community structure on arsenic speciation and flux in mining-affected river systems. To address this research gap, a study was carried out in Huangshui Creek, Hunan province, China, which has been severely impacted by long-term historic realgar (alpha-As4S4) mining. Water and sediment sampling, and batch experiments at different temperatures using creek sediment, were used to determine the form, source and mobility of arsenic. Pentavalent (AsO43) and trivalent arsenic (AsO33-) were the dominant aqueous species (70-89% and 30-11%, respectively) in the creek, and the maximum concentration of inorganic arsenic in surface water was 10,400 mu g/L. Dry season aqueous arsenic concentrations were lower than those in the wet season samples. The sediments contained both arsenate and arsenite, and relative proportions of these varied with season. 8.3 tons arsenic per annum were estimated to be exported from Huangshui Creek. Arsenic release from sediment increased by 3 to 5 times in high water temperature batch experiments (25 and 37 degrees C) compared to those carried out at low temperature (8 degrees C). Our data suggest that the arsenic-containing sediments were the main source of arsenic contamination in Huangshui Creek. Microbial community structured varied at the different sample sites along the creek. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that both temperature and arsenic concentrations were the main controlling factors on the structure of the microbial community. Protecbacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia, and Planctomycetes were the stable dominant phyla in both dry and wet seasons. The genera Flavobacterium, Hydrogenophaga and Sphingomonas occurred in the most highly arsenic contaminated sites, which removed arsenic by related metabolism.Our findings indicate that seasonal variations profoundly control arsenic flux and species, microbial community structure and ultimately, the biogeochemical fate of arsenic.

These carbon stocks are vulnerable to warming temperatures and increased permafrost thaw and the breakdown and release of soil C in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). The majority of research has focused on quantifying and upscaling the effects of thaw on CO2 and CH4 emissions from terrestrial systems. However, small ponds formed in permafrost wetlands following thawing have been recognized as hotspots for C emissions. Here, we examined the importance of small ponds for C fluxes in two permafrost wetland ecosystems in northern Sweden. Detailed flux estimates of thaw ponds during the growing season show that ponds emit, on average (+/- SD), 279 +/- 415 and 7 +/- 11 mmol C m(-2) d(-2) of CO2 and CH4, respectively. Importantly, addition of pond emissions to the total C budget of the wetland decreases the C sink by -39%. Our results emphasize the need for integrated research linking C cycling on land and in water in order to make correct assessments of contemporary C balances.

Angela; Sun, Ranhao; Chen, Liding			Effect of urban green patterns on surface urban cool islands and its seasonal variations	URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING												Urban green spaces often form urban cool islands (UCIs), which are important for human health and urban sustainability. Previous studies have emphasized the cooling effects of urban green spaces on their surrounding areas at landscape level. Less attention, however, has been directed to effects of urban green space patterns on their own UCIs at patch level. In this study, we focused on the effects of spatial patterns of urban green patches on their own surface UCIs. The urban green spaces of Beijing, China, were extracted from one QuickBird image and were classified as Trees, Shrubs, Grass, Crops, River and Lake. Land surface temperatures (LSTs) were derived from four Landsat images, each in one season. The UCI was represented by the minimum LST of each urban green patch. Results showed spatial patterns of urban green patches had significant effects on their UCIs in four seasons. In detail, the size, edge and connectivity of urban green spaces all affected the UCIs negatively, and the influence was stronger in warm seasons. Shape of urban green space also had effects on UCIs, but the effects were stronger in cool seasons. Great differences were found between predictive values of metrics for different green types. Shape metrics were more important for indicating UCIs of River, Trees and Crops than were patch size and connectivity. However, patch size and connectivity metrics were more effective in determining UCIs of Shrubs, Grass and Lake than were shape metrics. Further, among shape metrics, only shape index was a good indicator of UCIs. The results of this study suggest that a combination of specific urban green types and pattern metrics are a prerequisite for analyzing the influence of urban green patterns on UCIs and for urban green design.

Organic contaminants in Great Lakes tributaries: Prevalence and potential aquatic toxicity	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Organic compounds used in agriculture, industry, and households make their way into surface waters through runoff, leaking septic-conveyance systems, regulated and unregulated discharges, and combined sewer overflows, among other sources. Concentrations of these organic waste compounds (OWCs) in some Great Lakes tributaries indicate a high potential for adverse impacts on aquatic organisms. During 2010-13, 709 water samples were collected at 57 tributaries, together representing approximately 41% of the total inflow to the lakes. Samples were collected during runoff and low-flow conditions and analyzed for 69 OWCs, including herbicides, insecticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, plasticizers, antioxidants, detergent metabolites, fire retardants, nonprescription human drugs, flavors/fragrances, and dyes. Urban-related land cover characteristics were the most important explanatory variables of concentrations of many OWCs. Compared to samples from non-urban watersheds (<15% urban land cover) samples from urban watersheds (>15% urban land cover) had nearly four times the number of detected compounds and four times the total sample concentration, on average. Concentration differences between runoff and low-flow conditions were not observed, but seasonal differences were observed in atrazine, metolachlor, DEET, and HHCB concentrations. Water quality benchmarks for individual OWCs were exceeded at 20 sites, and at 7 sites benchmarks were exceeded by a factor of 10 or more. The compounds with the most frequent water quality benchmark exceedances were the PAHs benzo[a]pyrene, pyrene, fluoranthene, and anthracene, the detergent metabolite 4-nonylphenol, and the herbicide atrazine. Computed estradiol equivalency quotients (EEQs) using only nonsteroidal endocrine-active compounds indicated medium to high risk of estrogenic effects (intersex or vitellogenin induction) at 10 sites. EEQs at 3 sites were comparable to values reported in effluent. This multifaceted study is the largest, most comprehensive assessment of the occurrence and potential effects of OWCs in the Great Lakes Basin to date. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The water quality status of the DJKR basin has been receiving worldwide attention because it is related to the health and safety of >100 million people and the integrity of an ecosystem covering >92,500 km2. In this study, basin-scale water quality sampling campaigns were conducted monthly at 47 monitoring sites in river systems of the DJKRB from the year 2020 to 2022, covering nine water quality indicators, i.e., water temperature (WT), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), permanganate index (CODMn), five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), total phosphorus (TP), total ni-trogen (TN), and fluoride (F-). The water quality index (WQI) and multivariate statistical techniques were introduced to comprehensively evaluate water quality status and understand the corresponding driving factors of water quality variations. An integrated risk assessment framework simultaneously considered intra and inter-regional factors using information theory-based and the SPA (Set-Pair Analysis) methods were proposed for basin-scale water quality management. The results showed that the water quality of the DJKR and its tributaries stably maintained a "good" sta-tus, with all the average WQIs >60 of river systems during the monitoring period. The spatial variations of all WQIs in the basin showed significantly different (Kruskal-Wallis tests, P < 0.01), while no seasonal differences were found. The increase in built-up land use and agricultural water consumption revealed the highest contributions (Mantel's r > 0.5, P < 0.05) to the rise of nutrient loadings of all river systems, showing the intensive anthropogenic activities can eclipse the power of natural processes on water quality variations to some extent. The risks of specific sub-basins that may cause water quality degradation on the MRSNWDPC were effectively quantified and identified into five classifications based on transfer entropy and the SPA methods. This study provides an informative risk assessment framework that was relatively easy to be applied by professionals and non-experts for basin-scale water quality management, thus providing a valuable and reliable reference for the administrative department to conduct effective pollution control in the future.

Higher concentrations of PBDEs were found in the middle and lower reaches of the river compared with those in the upper reaches, ascribed to the relatively developed and urbanized cities located in the areas near the middle and lower reaches. The PBDE concentrations in the samples collected during the dry season were lower than those in the samples collected during the wet season because of thaw and rainfall. The dominant congener, with a contribution of 44.6-90.3%, was BDE-209, which originated from the residual of commercial deca-BDE. Three groups of congeners in all the samples showed good correlations with the coefficient ranging from 0.662 to 0.999 (p < 0.01), indicating common sources and similar environmental behaviors. Regression analysis suggested that the local industrial product (IP) and population density (PD) were good indicators of PBDEs in the water and sediment of the Yellow River.

Intensified land-use and pronounced global climate change have put pressure on the environment of the TP. We studied the tempo-spatial variability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to better understand the fluxes of nutrients and energy from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems in the TP. We used a multiparametrical approach, based on inorganic water chemistry, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, dissolved organic matter (DOM) characteristics (chromophoric DOM, fluorescence DOM and delta C-13 of DOM) in stream samples of three catchments of the Nam Co watershed and the lake itself. Satellite based plant cover estimates were used to link biogeochemical data to the structure and degradation of vegetation zones in the catchments. Catchment streams showed site-specific DOM signatures inherited fromglaciers, wetlands, groundwater, and Kobresia pygmaea pastures. By comparing streamand lake samples, we found DOM processing and unification by loss of chromophoric DOM-signatures and a change towards an autochthonous source of lake DOM. DOM-diversity was largest in the headwaters of the catchments and heavily modified in terminal aquatic systems. Seasonality was characterized by a minor influence of freshet and by a very strong impact of the Indian summermonsoon onDOMcomposition, with more microbial DOM sources. The DOM of Lake NamCo differed chemically fromstreamwater samples, indicating the lake to be a quasi-marine environment in regards to the degree of chemical modification and sources of DOM. DOM-proved to be a powerful marker to elucidate consequences of land use and climatic change on biogeochemical processes in High Asian alpine ecosystems.					; Guggenberger, Georg/C-8423-2013; Maurischat, Philipp/AAC-9153-2022; Li, Xiaogang/AAE-1968-2022; Lehnert, Lukas/D-9376-2013; Tran, Tuong Vi/AAX-1146-2021; Kalbitz, Karsten/A-9641-2013; Rinnan, Åsmund/E-6989-2010	Lehnert, Lukas/0000-0002-5229-2282; Maurischat, Philipp/0000-0002-4352-0386; Li, Xiao Gang/0000-0003-3025-4397; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				SEP 10	2022	838		4						156542	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156542	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156542		JUN 2022						35690211					WOS:000865767900009
J	Rocha, MDD; Neto, IEL				Delmiro Rocha, Maria de Jesus; Lima Neto, Iran Eduardo			Internal phosphorus loading and its driving factors in the dry period of Brazilian semiarid reservoirs	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												This study investigated the relationships between physical, limnological and climatic drivers with the internal total phosphorus (TP) loading produced over the dry period in 30 water supply reservoirs of the Brazilian semiarid. Improvements in the understanding of sedimentary TP fluxes in reservoirs of dryland regions are pressing as they usually have serious water quality related issues, remaining mostly eutrophic especially under frequent drought events. Gross daily fluxes and net seasonal average release rates were calculated from mass balance and regression equations considering water and sediment TP concentrations, anoxic duration, water temperature and fish contribution. Additionally, the ratio of wind speed to reservoir volume was proposed as a new surrogate and then applied as explanatory variable to predictive models. The results indicated TP release rates higher than reported for non-semiarid lakes/reservoirs with average gross fluxes ranging from 17.64 to 35.99 mg m(-2) day(-1). This may be attributed to the enriched sediments (1029.49 +/- 552.49 mg kg(-1)) allied with warmer water temperature, high trophic state, and prolonged anoxic periods (average duration of about 60 days). The average release rates were negatively correlated with water transparency and water depth, and positively correlated with Chl-a, wind speed and trophic state. The release rates increased across the trophic gradient (p < 0.05), about 10-fold higher under hypertrophic conditions than in oligotrophic ones. As anoxia is linked with eutrophication, phosphorus release is more likely in eutrophic ecosystems. Regarding the new surrogate, a strong predictive ability for TP release (R-2: 0.26-0.93) was observed. Similarly, the proposed models presented a physically consistent behavior with a stabilizing releasing pattern suggesting the achievement of equilibrium in nutrient exchange between sediment-water interface. This research advanced by combining and proposing methods to assess and quantify sedimentary fluxes in data-scarce regions balancing accuracy and transferability, in order to be replicable to other dryland environments globally.					; Lima Neto, Iran/B-2980-2012	Delmiro Rocha, Maria de Jesus/0000-0001-9874-358X; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				JUN 15	2022	312								114983	10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.114983	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.114983		APR 2022						35390612					WOS:000806346200003
J	Feng, Y; Zheng, BH; Jia, HF; Peng, JY; Zhou, XY				Feng, Yu; Zheng, Bing-Hui; Jia, Hai-Feng; Peng, Jia-Yu; Zhou, Xi-Yin			Influence of social and economic development on water quality in Dongting Lake	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Lakes have faced the challenge of alleviating water deterioration due to rapid socioeconomic development. This fact highlights the urgency to understand the impact of socioeconomic development on water quality. Although existing studies have devoted efforts on the research of the relationship between socioeconomic development and water quality, the theoretical basis and process of factors selection (socioeconomic factors and water quality factors) have often been ignored. A conceptual model was employed in this work to select the candidate indicators. Meanwhile, a new developed method that introduces a monthly correction coefficient was proposed to evaluate socioeconomic indicators and seasonal-trend decomposition (STL) using the locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) method. At the same time, the steady-state transformation index (RSI) were adopted to further select water quality indicators. Base on that, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and the measured and ideal values of water quality indicators were used to quantitatively study the degree of influence of socioeconomic systems and their key factors on water quality. The proposed methodology were applied to the Dongting Lake basin and its four sub-watersheds, the Xiang, Zi, Yuan and Li River watersheds, as these water bodies have been seriously affected by human activities in recent years. The results showed that there was a high correlation between the socioeconomic system and water quality, with significant temporal and spatial characteristics. The average annual impact degree of the socioeconomic system on water quality was at a moderate level for Dongting Lake basin and its four sub-watersheds, while the impact degree for Xiang River watershed was higher than that of the other watersheds. The influence degree decreased in the Dongting Lake basin, Xiang River and Li River watersheds, whereas the trend was the opposite in the Yuan River and Zi River watersheds from 2004 to 2017. Water consumption (WC), percentage of cultivated land area (CA), total nitrogen (TN) input from agricultural non-point sources (A_TN), and human response factors, such as industrial wastewater compliance discharge rate (WR) and sewage treatment (ST), were the main socioeconomic factors affecting the water quality of Dongting Lake. Implementation of an efficient water use plan, controlling the agricultural non-point source pollution and improving the sewage treatment capacity should be given priority in order to effectively improve the water quality of Dongting Lake. The present study showed the relationship between socioeconomic drivers and water quality, and provided a reliable tool for decision makers in watershed management.					, haifeng/AAF-7606-2021	jia, haifeng/0000-0002-3005-9316													1470-160X	1872-7034				NOV	2021	131								108220	10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108220	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108220		SEP 2021											WOS:000703702200009

Disproportionate Contribution of Vegetated Habitats to the CH4 and CO2 Budgets of a Boreal Lake	ECOSYSTEMS												Many lakes have areas that are colonized by different types of macrophytes, including emergent plants that are rooted in sediments. Emergent macrophytes are known to influence local organic carbon (C) and greenhouse gas dynamics but are rarely considered in lake C assessments. Here, we assessed the direct and indirect effects of emergent macrophytes Typha latifolia and Brasenia schreberi on both CH4 and CO2 ambient concentrations and fluxes (diffusive, ebullitive, and plant-mediated) in a typical oligotrophic boreal lake and quantified the contribution of these vegetated habitats to the whole lake C emission budget. Surface water CO2 was generally elevated in vegetated habitats relative to unvegetated habitats. The largest differences between habitats, however, were observed in CH4 dynamics, with total CH4 emissions from vegetated habitats exceeding those from unvegetated littoral and pelagic habitats by one to two orders of magnitude. Direct plant transport dominated CH4 emissions in the T. latifolia habitat, whereas ebullition was the main pathway in the B. schreberi habitat, highlighting the importance of plant type. The average lake CH4 flux for the ice-free season would be 1.6 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) if only the unvegetated habitats were considered. This estimate increases by an order of magnitude (to 14.5 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)) when the vegetated littoral habitats, which contribute 81% of the total C emissions from 26% of the lake surface area, are factored in. Our results suggest that lake C gas budgets based only on pelagic and unvegetated littoral sampling may strongly underestimate total lake C emissions, especially in shallow lakes that develop extensive vegetated habitats.

Spatial and temporal changes of P and Ca distribution and fractionation in soil and sediment in a karst farmland-wetland system	CHEMOSPHERE												Phosphorus (P) is a critical element affecting eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems. Its availability is closely related to calcium (Ca) in calcareous soils and sediments, but their relations are unclear. In this study, the spatial and temporal changes in P and Ca fractionation and distribution in a karst farmland-wetland ecosystem were investigated. The results showed that total P concentrations were 1.25 -3.19 g kg(-1), with higher concentrations in paddy soil than in sediment. Total Ca concentrations were 3.93-10.2 g kg(-1), with higher Ca being accumulated in sediments than in soils. The P fractionations varied seasonally, with Ca-bound P being dominant. The moderately-stable Fe/Al-bound P showed temporal variation, while Ca was dominant in acid-soluble fraction, both probably playing an important role in controlling P availability. Correlation analysis showed seasonal relation between Ca and P distribution in soil/sediment. This study suggests that P migration from farmland to wetland may be a major source for P accumulation in sediments in a karst farmland-wetland system. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Monitoring of greenhouse gases and pollutants across an urban area using a light-rail public transit platform	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Anthropogenic emissions within urban environments are characterized by spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability that present challenges for measuring urban greenhouse gases and air pollutants. To address these challenges, we mounted instruments on public transit light-rail train cars that traverse the metropolitan Salt Lake Valley (SLV) in Utah, USA to observe the temporal and spatial variability of atmospheric species including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), ozone (O-3), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Utilizing electrified light-rail public transit as an observational platform enables real-time measurements with low operating costs while avoiding self-contamination from vehicle exhaust. We examine temporal averages and case studies of each species that reveal gradients, intermittent point sources, seasonal and did changes, and complex relationships resulting from emissions, atmospheric chemistry, and meteorological conditions. CO2 and NO2 are related through the combustion of fossil fuel and we observed a broad spatial gradient across the city as well distinct plumes at traffic intersections and, for NO2, a large plume adjacent to a locomotive rail yard. Distributions of O-3 were strongly correlated with NO2 due to atmospheric photochemical and titration processes. Episodes of high PM2.5 had distinct spatial patterns depending on meteorological conditions during wintertime persistent cold-air pool episodes. The spatial pattern of CH4 was characterized by distinct plumes associated with industrial and commercial facilities, some of which followed temporal patterns indicative of daytime working hours; other plumes were persistent throughout the whole day, suggestive of leak-related fugitive emissions. The ongoing multi-year record of spatial and temporal air quality observations provides a valuable data set for future air quality exposure studies. Our results suggest pollution and greenhouse gas emission monitoring and exposure assessment could be greatly enhanced by deploying instruments on public transit systems in urban centers worldwide.					; Mitchell, Logan/A-5481-2011; Ehleringer, James/G-1780-2010	Jacques, Alexander/0009-0004-3729-2702; Mitchell, Logan/0000-0002-8749-954X; Crosman, Erik/0000-0002-0047-384X; Fasoli, Benjamin/0000-0001-7372-2176													1352-2310	1873-2844				AUG	2018	187						9	23		10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.05.044	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.05.044													WOS:000439672800002

Emerging studies with a focus on greenhouse gases reveal that small rivers can contribute to more than half of the global carbon emissions from inland waters (including lakes and wetlands). However, large-scale extraction of drainage networks is constrained by the coarse resolution of observational data and models, which hinders assessments of terrestrial hydrological and biogeochemical cycles. Recognizing that Sentinel-2 satellite can detect surface water up to a 10-m resolution over large scales, we propose a new method named Remote Sensing Stream Burning (RSSB) to integrate high-resolution observational flow location with coarse topography to improve the extraction of drainage network. In RSSB, satellite-derived input is integrated in a spatially continuous manner, producing a quasi-bathymetry map where relative relief is enforced, enabling a fine-grained, accurate, and multitemporal extraction of drainage network. RSSB was applied to the Lancang-Mekong River basin to derive a 10-m resolution drainage network, with a significant reduction in location errors as validated by the river centerline measurements. The high-resolution extraction resulted in a realistic representation of meanders and detailed network connections. Further, RSSB enabled a multitemporal extraction of river networks during wet/dry seasons and before/after the formation of new channels. The proposed method is fully automated, meaning that the network extraction preserves basin-wide connectivity without requiring any postprocessing, hence facilitating the construction of drainage networks data with openly accessible imagery. The RSSB method provides a basis for the accurate representation of drainage networks that maintains channel connectivity, allows a more realistic inclusion of small rivers and streams, and enables a greater understanding of complex but active exchange between inland water and other related Earth system components.

Studies have shown that bacteria-cyanobacteria interactions contributed significantly to phytoplankton dynamics. However, information on the contribution of bacterial communities to blooms remains scarce. Here, we tracked changes in the bacterial community during the development of a cyanobacterial bloom in an equatorial estuarine reservoir. Two forms of blooms were observed simultaneously corresponding to the lotic and lentic characteristics of the sampling sites where significant spatial variabilities in physicochemical water quality, cyanobacterial biomass, secondary metabolites, and cyanobacterial/ bacterial compositions were detected. Microcystis dominated the upstream sites during peak periods and were succeeded by Synechococcus when the bloom subsided. For the main body of the reservoir, a mixed bloom featuring coccoid and filamentous cyanobacteria (Microcystis, Synechococcus, Planktothricoides, Nodosilinea, Raphidiopsis, and Prochlorothrix) was observed. Concentrations of the picocyano-bacteria Synechococcus remained high throughout the study, and their positive correlations with cylindrospermopsin and anatoxin-a suggested that they could produce cyanotoxins, which pose more damaging impacts than previously supposed. Succession of different cyanobacteria (Synechococcus and Microcystis) following changes in nutrient composition and ionic strength was demonstrated. The microbiomes associated with blooms were unique to the dominant cyanobacteria. Generic and specialized bloom biomarkers for the Microcystis and downstream mixed blooms were also identified. Microscillaceae, Chthoniobacteraceae, and Roseomonas were the major heterotrophic bacteria associated with Microcystis bloom, whereas Phycisphaeraceae and Methylacidiphilaceae were the most prominent groups for the Synechococcus bloom. Collectively, bacterial community can be greatly deviated by the geological condition, monsoon season, cyanobacterial density, and dominant cyanobacteria.					; Zhang, Dong/JCP-2272-2023	Gin, Karina Yew-Hoong/0000-0002-1266-9276; Zhang, Dong/0009-0004-8491-1772; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				2023 JAN 18	2023										10.1021/acs.est.2c04943	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c04943		JAN 2023						36653016					WOS:000922918500001

FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Ciliates represent central nodes in freshwater planktonic food webs, and many species show pronounced seasonality, with short-lived maxima of a few dominant taxa while many being rare or ephemeral. These observations are primarily based on morphospecies counting methods, which, however, have limitations concerning the amount and volume of samples that can be processed. For high sampling frequencies at large scales, high throughput sequencing (HTS) of freshwater ciliates seems to be a promising tool. However, several studies reported large discrepancy between species abundance determinations by molecular compared to morphological means. Therefore, we compared ciliate DNA metabarcodes (V9 regions of the 18S rRNA gene) with morphospecies counts for a 3-year study (Lake Zurich, Switzerland; biweekly sampling, n = 74). In addition, we isolated, cultivated and sequenced the 18S rRNA gene of twelve selected ciliate species that served as seeds for HTS analyses. This workflow allowed for a detailed comparison of V9 data with microscopic analyses by quantitative protargol staining (QPS). The dynamics of V9 read abundances over the seasonal cycle corroborated well with morphospecies population patterns. Annual successions of rare and ephemeral species were more adequately characterized by V9 reads than by QPS. However, numbers of species specific sequence reads only partly reflected rank orders seen by counts. In contrast, biomass-based assemblage compositions showed higher similarity to V9 read numbers, probably indicating a relation between cell sizes and numbers / sizes of macronuclei (or 18S rRNA operons). Full-length 18S rRNA sequences of ciliates assigned to certain morphospecies are urgently needed for barcoding approaches as planktonic taxa are still poorly represented in public databases and the interpretation of HTS data depends on profound reference sequences. Through linking operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with known morphospecies, we can use the deep knowledge about the autecology of these species.

Our study incorporates spatial and temporal data to quantify concentrations of inorganic (bromide (Br-), iodide (I-), and iodate (IO3-)), organic, and total bromine (BrT) and iodine (IT) species from 286 drinking water sources and 7 wastewater effluents across the United States. Br- ranged from <5-7800 mu g/L (median of 62 mu g/L in surface water (SW) and 95 mu g/L in groundwater (GW)). I-was detected in 41% of SW (1-72 mu g/L, median = <1 mu g/L) and 62% of GW (<1-250 mu g/L, median = 3 mu g/L) samples. The median Br-/I- ratio in SW and GW was 22 mu g/mu g and 16 mu g/mu g, respectively, in paired samples with detect Br- and I-. BrT existed primarily as Br-, while IT was present as I-, IO3 -, and/or total organic iodine (TOI). Inorganic iodine species (I- and IO3-) were predominant in GW samples, accounting for 60-100% of IT; however, they contributed to only 20-50% of IT in SW samples. The unknown fraction of IT was attributed to TOI. In lakes, seasonal cycling of I-species was observed and was presumably due to algal productivity. Finally, Spearman Rank Correlation tests revealed a strong correlation between Br- and IT in SW (RBr-,IT = 0.83) following the log10 (Br-, mu g/L) = 0.65 x log10 (IT, mu g/L) - 0.17 relationship. Br- and I- in treated wastewater effluents (median Br- = 234 mu g/L, median I- = 5 mu g/L) were higher than drinking water sources.

Remote sensing tools are essential for monitoring and unveiling their variability. Turbidity is a water quality parameter used for studying eutrophication and sediment transport. The objective of this research is to analyze the monthly turbidity pattern in a shallow coastal lagoon along two years with different precipitation regimes. The selected study area is the Albufera de Valencia lagoon (Spain). For this purpose, we used Sentinel 2 images and in situ data from the monitoring program of the Environment General Subdivision of the regional government. We obtained Sentinel 2A and 2B images for years 2017 and 2018 and processed them with SNAP software. The results of the correlation analysis between satellite and in situ data, corroborate that the reflectance of band 5 (705 nm) is suitable for the analysis of turbidity patterns in shallow lagoons (average depth 1 m), such as the Albufera lagoon, even in eutrophic conditions. Turbidity patterns in the Albufera lagoon show a similar trend in wet and dry years, which is mainly linked to the irrigation practice of rice paddies. High turbidity periods are linked to higher water residence time and closed floodgates. However, precipitation and wind also play an important role in the spatial distribution of turbidity. During storm events, phytoplankton and sediments are discharged to the sea, if the floodgates remain open. Fortunately, the rice harvesting season, when the floodgates are open, coincides with the beginning of the rainy period. Nevertheless, this is a lucky coincidence. It is important to develop conscious management of floodgates, because having them closed during rain events can have several negative effects both for the lagoon and for the receiving coastal waters and ecosystem. Non-discharged solids may accumulate in the lagoon worsening the clogging problems, and the beaches next to the receiving coastal waters will not receive an important load of solids to nourish them.

An increasing role of pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles funestus in malaria transmission in the Lake Zone, Tanzania	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Anopheles funestus is playing an increasing role in malaria transmission in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, where An. gambiae s.s. has been effectively controlled by long-lasting insecticidal nets. We investigated vector population bionomics, insecticide resistance and malaria transmission dynamics in 86 study clusters in North-West Tanzania. An. funestus s.l. represented 94.5% (4740/5016) of all vectors and was responsible for the majority of malaria transmission (96.5%), with a sporozoite rate of 3.4% and average monthly entomological inoculation rate (EIR) of 4.57 per house. Micro-geographical heterogeneity in species composition, abundance and transmission was observed across the study district in relation to key ecological differences between northern and southern clusters, with significantly higher densities, proportions and EIR of An. funestus s.l. collected from the South. An. gambiae s.l. (5.5%) density, principally An. arabiensis (81.1%) and An. gambiae s.s. (18.9%), was much lower and closely correlated with seasonal rainfall. Both An. funestus s.l. and An. gambiae s.l. were similarly resistant to alpha-cypermethrin and permethrin. Overexpression of CYP9K1, CYP6P3, CYP6P4 and CYP6M2 and high L1014S-kdr mutation frequency were detected in An. gambiae s.s. populations. Study findings highlight the urgent need for novel vector control tools to tackle persistent malaria transmission in the Lake Region of Tanzania.					; Kulkarni, Manisha/AGP-4383-2022; Messenger, Louisa/JAO-0055-2023	Messenger, Louisa A/0000-0002-3107-6214; Rowland, Mark/0000-0002-5567-9562; Martin, Jackline/0000-0003-4629-8837; Protopopoff, Natacha/0000-0001-6698-4936; Kaaya, Robert/0000-0001-6100-0205; Mosha, Jacklin Franklin/0000-0001-7940-8903; Matowo, Nancy/0000-0002-2302-3796; Mosha, Franklin/0000-0002-8411-5029; 													2045-2322					JUN 29	2021	11	1							13457	10.1038/s41598-021-92741-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92741-8								34188090					WOS:000671779700020

A total of 55 out of 61 monitored PPCPs were detected, with concentrations up to 647 ng/L. The maximum concentrations of 75% of monitored antibiotics and 80% of non-antibiotics were above the median values of previously reported maximum concentrations in China, indicating that the basin is heavily contaminated. It is estimated that the PPCP mass flow of the Taige Canal (0.06-0.58 kg/day) entering into Lake Taihu is similar to that of the influent of a wastewater treatment plant. Analysis of the seasonal variation shows that, during the wet season, the average total concentration of sulfonamides was 8 and 11 times that of the normal season and dry season, respectively. The concentration of sulfachlorpyridazine accounted for 40.37% of total antibiotics, suggesting heavy pollution from the animal-breeding industry in this area. The PPCP mass flow rates observed in 2019 were lower than those of 2015 in the same season, and this interannual variation is mainly attributable to water pollution controls in the watershed. Combined analysis of ordination and clustering indicates that the distribution of PPCPs in the Taige Canal is affected by the confluence with Yong'an River and human activities such as water pollution control. Water-sediment distribution analysis demonstrates that the sediment-water distribution coefficients of quinolone and macrolide were higher than those of sulfonamide, lincosamide and chloramphenicol.

J	Zhao, Y; Han, JY; Zhang, B; Gong, JG				Zhao, Yong; Han, Jingyan; Zhang, Bing; Gong, Jiaguo			Impact of transferred water on the hydrochemistry and water quality of surface water and groundwater in Baiyangdian Lake, North China	GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS												The hydrochemical composition of surfacewater and groundwater is a key parameter for understanding the evolution ofwater and its quality. In particular, little is known about the impact of transferredwater on surface water and groundwater. In this study, Baiyangdian Lakewas selected as a typical area for extensive groundwater exploration and surface water transfer in the North China Plain. Surfacewater and groundwater sampleswere sampled in dry/wet seasons and then analyzed before/after the water transfer, respectively. Generally, surface water and groundwater are extensively hydrologically connected based on hydrochemical evidence. It was found that the hydrochemical composition of the shallowgroundwater is affected by the surfacewater and that thewater quality of the deep groundwater is stable. However, inter-aquifer recharge processes from the shallow groundwater to the deep groundwater existed in the anthropogenic region impacted with high nitrate-ion concentrations. Also, the hydrochemical composition of the surface water and groundwater was dominated by rockweathering and evaporation-precipitation processes. Due to the existence of the deep vadose zone in the alluvial fan, Na+ was exchanged into soil matrices during the leakage of the surface water. In addition, the transferred water resulted in surface water with good quality, and it also played as an important recharge source to groundwater. As themost important water resource for irrigation and drinking, deep groundwater should be paidmore attention in the alluvial fan with frequent water transfer and extensive groundwater exploration.

Pearson correlation analysis is conducted on measured Chl-a concentration and band reflectance to determine the sensitive bands or multiband combinations of the Chl-a to input to a support vector machine (SVM) model. An indicator beta is defined to evaluate the model performance of fitting and prediction. The model performs well with the lowest beta (decision coefficient, (R-2) = 0.774; root mean square error (RMSE) = 22.636 mu g/L) of the validation set. The model test results prove that the model performs well. We analyze the impact factors of the model. The seasonal factor affects the model performance significantly; thus, samples from different seasons should be combined to train the model and inverse the water quality. Noise points reduce the model accuracy significantly; therefore, obvious outliers must be excluded at first. Additionally, the sampling method affects model accuracy, and systematic sampling in the descending order of Chl-a concentration is recommended. The combination of SVM algorithm and remote sensing technology provides a convenient, scientific, and real-time method to monitor and control water quality.

Here, we proposed models using Sentinel-2 images based on the light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) to quantify the monthly surface water dynamics in the middle farming-pastoral ecotone of the Northern China (MFPENC) region, which was facing severe water security challenges from 2016 to 2021, at a 10-m resolution. The results show that the proposed models perform very well, with average values over 99.9% derived for four classification metrics; LightGBM is time-efficient and robust in different scenarios for surface water dynamic monitoring. The maps produced by these models could capture the details of surface water accurately in the MFPENC region; the surface water area of the M-FPENC region showed a clear seasonal pattern, showing the largest average extent in June (856.9 km2) and the smallest average extent in November (486.6 km2); the annual average maximum water area was 1030.9 km2, of which 630.9 km2 was seasonal and 400 km2 was permanent.

However, many closed lakes are facing continuous deterioration of water quality. To scientifically and comprehensively evaluate the water quality of Daihai Lake (a closed lake in a semiarid region of China) and analyze its spatiotemporal variations and influencing factors, this study analyzed the following nine water quality parameters at five monitoring stations from 2008 to 2017 using the water quality index (WQI) and multivariate statistical techniques: permanganate index (CODMn), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), fluoride (F-), water temperature (WT), pH, ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), and dissolved oxygen (DO). The results showed that the average WQI at the five monitoring stations varies between 45.53 and 46.98, and the water quality of Daihai Lake has improved (2013-2017) after an initial period of pollution (2008-2013), but it remains poor. The main contaminants were identified as CODMn, BOD5, TN, TP, and F-, which showed average concentrations of 13.12, 6.19, 0.98, 0.13, and 2.82 mg/L, respectively. The water quality showed small spatial variability, but distinct variations between the dry and wet seasons. Discriminant analysis showed that 97% of the water quality data can be classified into the correct seasonal with six parameters (WT, pH, CODMn, TN, and NH4+-N). Anthropogenic activities were the main factors driving the variation in water quality. Climatic conditions promoted the release of internal pollutants and aggravated the impact of external pollutants during the dry and wet seasons, respectively. The minimum WQI determined using only key water quality parameters (DO, BOD5, NH4+-N, TP, and TN) could effectively reflect the actual water quality. These results can provide references for lake ecosystem protection and water resources management.

However, the current knowledge of methane emissions following thermokarst development is primarily based on expanding lakes and wetlands, with upland thermokarst being studied less often. In this study, we monitored the methane emissions during the peak growing seasons of two consecutive years along a thaw sequence within a thermo-erosion gully in a Tibetan swamp meadow. Both years had consistent results, with the early and midthaw stages (3 to 12 years since thaw) exhibiting low methane emissions that were similar to those in the undisturbed meadow, while the emissions from the late thaw stage (20 years since thaw) were 3.5 times higher. Our results also showed that the soil water filled pore space, rather than the soil moisture per se, in combination with the sand content, were the main factors that caused increased methane emissions. These findings differ from the traditional view that upland thermokarst could reduce methane emissions owing to the improvement of drainage conditions, suggesting that upland thermokarst development does not always result in a decrease in methane emissions.

ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Despite the exponential increase of studies on plastic debris in recent years, there are still few works focusing on the problem as it relates to inland waters: little is known about the accumulation and dispersion dynamics on lake shores, and there are no standardized sampling methods for monitoring purposes. The accumulation of plastic litter in natural habitats also threatens the resident organisms. In this paper, we investigated the abundance and accumulation of plastic particles, ranging in size from 1 to 50 mm, from the beach sediment of three volcanic lakes in Central Italy: Albano, Bracciano, and Vico. The collection was designed to define the most important variables that one must consider in order to obtain a representative sample of plastic litter in a lake environment. In view of the high heterogeneity of sampling protocols used, comparison among the obtained results is limited and sometimes impossible. By using one of the proposed sampling methodologies, and critically analyzing the results, we aimed to highlight a possible monitoring criterion and to identify specific elements that can be meaningful and representative. The samples were collected in May and September 2017. For each lake, we sampled plastic items and sediments from two beaches. Albano contained the largest amount of plastic (in weight), while Bracciano had the largest number of particles. Our observations lead us to infer that the number of particles is the parameter most sensitive to environmental variations, as well as the more suitable for monitoring with greater definition the differences between sites. Moreover, sampling should be taken in different seasons, following a sampling pattern that includes at least two beaches placed in strategic positions with respect to wind and waves. In order to identify new indicators to evaluate the entry points of plastic into the food web, we collected, from the same sites analyzed, some specimens of the Talitrid Amphipod Cryptorchestia garbinii, a detritivorous species having a critical role in debris turnover of these environments. To investigate the microplastic (MP) ingestion in natural conditions, we analyzed their digestive tracts with both Nile red staining method and micro-FTIR spectroscopy. The analyses confirmed that C. garbinii was able to ingest plastics in natural conditions. Therefore, it can signify one of the entry points for microplastics (MPs) in the trophic chain. This observation constitutes the first evidence of MP ingestion in this species.

Investigating hypoxia in aquatic environments: diverse approaches to addressing a complex phenomenon	BIOGEOSCIENCES												In this paper we provide an overview of new knowledge on oxygen depletion (hypoxia) and related phenomena in aquatic systems resulting from the EU-FP7 project HYPOX ("In situ monitoring of oxygen depletion in hypoxic ecosystems of coastal and open seas, and landlocked water bodies", www.hypox.net). In view of the anticipated oxygen loss in aquatic systems due to eutrophication and climate change, HYPOX was set up to improve capacities to monitor hypoxia as well as to understand its causes and consequences. Temporal dynamics and spatial patterns of hypoxia were analyzed in field studies in various aquatic environments, including the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, Scottish and Scandinavian fjords, Ionian Sea lagoons and embayments, and Swiss lakes. Examples of episodic and rapid (hours) occurrences of hypoxia, as well as seasonal changes in bottom-water oxygenation in stratified systems, are discussed. Geologically driven hypoxia caused by gas seepage is demonstrated. Using novel technologies, temporal and spatial patterns of water-column oxygenation, from basin-scale seasonal patterns to meter-scale sub-micromolar oxygen distributions, were resolved. Existing multidecadal monitoring data were used to demonstrate the imprint of climate change and eutrophication on long-term oxygen distributions. Organic and inorganic proxies were used to extend investigations on past oxygen conditions to centennial and even longer timescales that cannot be resolved by monitoring. The effects of hypoxia on faunal communities and biogeochemical processes were also addressed in the project. An investigation of benthic fauna is presented as an example of hypoxia-devastated benthic communities that slowly recover upon a reduction in eutrophication in a system where naturally occurring hypoxia overlaps with anthropogenic hypoxia. Biogeochemical investigations reveal that oxygen intrusions have a strong effect on the microbially mediated redox cycling of elements. Observations and modeling studies of the sediments demonstrate the effect of seasonally changing oxygen conditions on benthic mineralization pathways and fluxes. Data quality and access are crucial in hypoxia research. Technical issues are therefore also addressed, including the availability of suitable sensor technology to resolve the gradual changes in bottom-water oxygen in marine systems that can be expected as a result of climate change. Using cabled observatories as examples, we show how the benefit of continuous oxygen monitoring can be maximized by adopting proper quality control. Finally, we discuss strategies for state-of-the-art data archiving and dissemination in compliance with global standards, and how ocean observations can contribute to global earth observation attempts.

J	Kirillin, G; Shatwell, T				Kirillin, G.; Shatwell, T.			Generalized scaling of seasonal thermal stratification in lakes	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Hutchinson and Loffler's (1956) classification of lakes based on the seasonal thermal mixing regime has become a cornerstone of any analysis of lakes as elements of the earth surface. Until now however the lake classification has lacked a physically sound quantitative criterion distinguishing between two fundamental lake types: thermally stratified during a large portion of the year (mono- and dimictic) and predominantly mixed to the bottom (polymictic). Using the mechanistic balance between potential and kinetic energy we review the different formulations of the Richardson number to derive a generalized scaling for seasonal stratification in a dosed lake basin. The scaling parameter is the critical mean basin depth, H-crit, that delineates lakes that mix regularly from those that stratify seasonally based on lake water transparency, lake length, and an annual mean estimate for the Monin-Obukhov length. We validate the scaling on available data of lakes worldwide using logistic regression. The scaling criterion consistently described the mixing regime significantly better than either the conventional unbounded basin scaling or a simple depth threshold. Thus, the generalized scaling is universal for freshwater lakes and allows the seasonal mixing regime to be estimated without numerically solving the heat transport equations. (C) 2016 The Authors.

While sea lamprey cannot climb or jump over low-head barriers, many desirable migratory species also cannot traverse barriers and are unintentionally blocked. Recently, there has been a push to reduce reliance on chemical controls as well as increase stream connectivity and flood conveyance. In response, the Great Lakes Fishery Commission (GLFC) continues to seek alternative methods of control. Great Lakes basin resource managers often request consideration of alternatives to both lampricide use and low-head barriers. Seasonal operation and alternative barrier designs (e.g. velocity barriers and electrical barriers) that incorporate additional features such as selective fish passage or flood conveyance are among the most commonly requested options. To date, alternative barrier technologies have been intermittently successful in the sea lamprey control program directed by the GLFC, yet continue to be proposed as alternatives to conventional low-head barriers. This document provides a comprehensive review on the current state of knowledge regarding the effectiveness of current and alternative barrier technologies and their historical use in the sea lamprey control program. This synthesis provides resource managers and sea lamprey control agents a reference and some tools to facilitate decision making around barriers that balance the critical need for invasive species control and fishery restoration.

Metal content in the premonsoon season was higher than the postmonsoon, due to influx of rainwater. The heavy metal pollution indices (HPI) at some locations was observed up to 1.45 times than recommended value and the cadmium (Cd) was found dominating metal for high HPI value. The Cd concentration in surface water and pore water varied from 2.8 to 14.9 mu g/L and 15.3-57.0 mu g/L, respectively, which was up to 6 times higher than the permissible limit. Ecological risk assessment for sediments illustrates 'moderate to considerable ecological risk', especially because of Cd. Hazard index (HI) calculated to identify potential human health risk by dermal exposure of surface water was <0.1, indicating 'negligible non-cancer risk' for all age group of people. However, HI varied from 0.73 to 1.49 for adult and 1.37-2.78 by consumption of fishes indicates children have higher 'non-cancer risk' than adult.

This study is based on Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data to analyse spatial and temporal variations in terrestrial water storage (TWS) across the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from April 2002 to December 2016. Regional averaged TWS anomaly has increased by 0.20mm/month (p<0.01) during the 2002-2012 period, but decreased by -0.68mm/month (p<0.01) since 2012. The seasonal variations in TWS anomalies also showed a decreasing trend from May 2012 to December 2016. TWS variations in the TP also showed significant spatial differences, which were decreasing in southern TP but increasing in the Inner TP. And a declining trend was clearly evident in the seasonal variability of TWS anomalies in the south TP (about -30 to -55mm/a), but increasing in the inner TP (about 10-35mm/a). Meanwhile, this study links temperature/precipitation changes, glacial retreat and lake area expansion to explain the spatial differences in TWS. Results indicated that precipitation increases and lake area expansion drove increasing TWS in the Inner TP during the 2002-2016 period, but temperature increases and glacial retreat drove decreasing TWS in southern TP.					deng, haijun/GSI-7962-2022; chen, yaning/AAN-8170-2020; liu, qun/B-7189-2019; Liu, Qun/B-7189-2019	Liu, Qun/0000-0002-3181-9057; Deng, Haijun/0000-0001-9957-9750; Pepin, Nicholas/0000-0001-6200-4937													0165-0009	1573-1480				DEC	2018	151	3-4					379	393		10.1007/s10584-018-2325-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-018-2325-9													WOS:000452480700002
J	Rodríguez, O; Bech, JB				Rodriguez, Oriol; Bech, Joan Bech			Tornadic environments in the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands based onERA5reanalysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												A dataset of 907 tornado and waterspout events recorded from 1980 to 2018 was built to study convective environments in the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands (western Mediterranean). The events were grouped into different categories, distinguishing waterspouts and tornadoes that were stratified by intensity according to the Fujita (F) scale and the Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale. The analysis separated the north-east (NE) and south-west (SW) subareas in the region of study, which present different seasonal cycles. For each event, atmospheric profiles from the ERA5 reanalysis data were used to determine convective available potential energy (CAPE), storm-relative helicity (SRH), vertical wind-shear (WS), the Universal Tornadic Index (UTI), and the product of wind-shear and the square root of two times CAPE (WMAXSHEAR). Results showed that the NE events are mostly associated with higher CAPE and lower helicity and wind-shear than the SW events. Thus, a significant number of SW tornadoes are associated with high-shear, low-CAPE environments. Moreover, the low-shear, high-LCL tornado environment, which is common inland during warm-season, is more usual in the NE subarea. Composite parameters such as the UTI and WMAXSHEAR(06)are good discriminators between significant and weak tornado events, although WMAXSHEAR(06)presents some limitations for the SW events due to low CAPE and weak differences in the WS (0-6 km) between the (E)F1 and (E)F2+ events. This weakness was resolved by using the 0-3 km WS instead of the 0-6 km WS when calculating the WMAXSHEAR. A new threshold for WMAXSHEAR(03)is proposed (500 m(2).s(-2)) to distinguish between significant and non-significant tornado environments. Finally, the Szilagyi Waterspout Nomogram, originally developed for the Great Lakes of North America, was successfully tested in the forecasting of waterspout formation for the first time in the western Mediterranean area, although the technique should be adapted to correctly detect cool-season mid-latitude waterspouts.

However, the occurrence, transport and fate of EDCs in the overlying water, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and sediment of inflowing rivers remain unclear. This study investigated the load of seven EDCs in a complex river-lake system of the Taihu Lake Basin during different seasons, with the aims of revealing the transport routes of EDCs and identifying the contributions from different sources. The results indicated that the levels of the seven EDCs in the wet season with high temperature and dilution effects were generally lower than those in the other seasons. EDC enrichment in the sediment was largely affected by the transport and fate of SPM. Moreover, the estrogenic activity and risks of EDCs were the highest in SPM. The mass loadings of particulate EDCs carried by SPM were 2.6 times that of overlying water. SPM plays a vital role in the transport and fate of EDCs in complex river-lake systems and thereby deserves more attention. Nonpoint sources, particularly animal husbandry activities and untreated domestic sewage, were the main sources of EDCs, amounting to 61.5% of the total load.					zhang, jianyun/X-7292-2018; Yan, Hanlu/KVY-6712-2024; Mao, Feijian/AAY-7891-2021	MAO, FEIJIAN/0000-0001-9286-0136													0304-3894	1873-3336				JUN 5	2022	431								128543	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.128543	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.128543		FEB 2022						35228078					WOS:000762752800003

Status of Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque 1817) in North America	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Lake Sturgeon is a potamodromous, fluvial-dependent species from the family Acipenseridae, and one of the largest freshwater fishes within its North American range extending to the Great lakes, Mississippi River, and Hudson Bay drainages. Like almost all other sturgeon species, Lake Sturgeon populations throughout its range suffered mass declines or extirpation in the late 1800s into the early 1900s, due to extensive overexploitation and habitat loss and alteration. However, Lake Sturgeon are still present in low to high densities throughout their native range due primarily to factors including: the species long life span and resiliency, the remote location of many northern populations, long-term pro-active management programs effectively controlling exploitation, improved habitat and water-quality conditions, and recovery programs that have been in effect since the late 1970s. Recovery programs initiated in the late 1970s are now just beginning to show signs of natural recruitment from populations re-built with stocked fish. Large sustainable recreational Lake Sturgeon fisheries with annual harvests of up to 45 000 kg and a commercial fishery with an annual harvest of up to 80 000 kg still exist and are maintained for Lake Sturgeon due primarily to rigid regulations, harvest controls, enforcement, and user involvement. The prognosis for the species is generally good, although habitat loss and maintaining public interest in the species management and recovery continue to be the greatest threats to local and regional populations. Hydropower development, especially in the northern part of the species' range, is especially challenging due to the potential negative impact this type of development can have on a long migrating fish like Lake Sturgeon. Advances in understanding Lake Sturgeon life history, habitat requirements, and distribution within and among water systems has strongly indicated that dams and Lake Sturgeon can coexist, if the correct planning and necessary mitigative techniques are employed at each site on a case-by-case basis.

J	Miao, YX; Stewart, BA; Zhang, FS				Miao, Yuxin; Stewart, Bobby A.; Zhang, Fusuo			Long-term experiments for sustainable nutrient management in China. A review	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												China is facing one of the largest challenges of this century to continue to increase annual cereal production to about 600 Mt by 2030 to ensure food security with shrinking cropland and limited resources, while maintaining or improving soil fertility, and protecting the environment. Rich experiences in integrated and efficient utilization of different strategies of crop rotation, intercropping, and all possible nutrient resources accumulated by Chinese farmers in traditional farming systems have been gradually abandoned and nutrient management shifted to over-reliance on synthetic fertilizers. China is now the world's largest producer, consumer and importer of chemical fertilizers. Overapplication of nitrogen (N) is common in intensive agricultural regions, and current N-uptake efficiency was reported to be only 28.3, 28.2 and 26.1% for rice, wheat and maize, respectively, and less than 20% in intensive agricultural regions and for fruit trees or vegetable crops. In addition to surface and groundwater pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, over-application of N fertilizers has caused significant soil acidification in major Chinese croplands, decreasing soil pH by 0.13 to 2.20. High yield as a top priority, small-scale farming, lack of temporal synchronization of nutrient supply and crop demand, lack of effective extension systems, and hand application of fertilizers by farmers are possible reasons leading to the over-application problems. There is little doubt that current nutrient management practices are not sustainable and more efficient management systems need to be developed. A review of long-term experiments conducted around the world indicated that chemical fertilizer alone is not enough to improve or maintain soil fertility at high levels and the soil acidification problem caused by overapplication of synthetic N fertilizers can be reduced if more fertilizer N is applied as NO (3) (-) relative to ammonium- or urea-based N fertilizers. Organic fertilizers can improve soil fertility and quality, but long-term application at high rates can also lead to more nitrate leaching, and accumulation of P, if not managed well. Well-managed combination of chemical and organic fertilizers can overcome the disadvantages of applying single source of fertilizers and sustainably achieve higher crop yields, improve soil fertility, alleviate soil acidification problems, and increase nutrient-use efficiency compared with only using chemical fertilizers. Crop yield can be increased through temporal diversity using crop rotation strategies compared with continuous cropping and legume-based cropping systems can reduce carbon and nitrogen losses. Crop yield responses to N fertilization can vary significantly from year to year due to variation in weather conditions and indigenous N supply, thus the commonly adopted prescriptive approach to N management needs to be replaced by a responsive in-season management approach based on diagnosis of crop growth, N status and demand. A crop sensor-based in-season site-specific N management strategy was able to increase Nuptake efficiency by 368% over farmers' practices in the North China Plain. Combination of these well-tested nutrient management principles and practices with modern crop management technologies is needed to develop sustainable nutrient management systems in China that can precisely match field-to-field and year-to-year variability in nutrient supply and crop demand for both single crops and crop rotations to not only improve nutrient-use efficiency but also increase crop yieldand protect the environment. In addition, innovative and effective extension and service-providing systems to assist farmers in adopting and applying new management systems and technologies are also crucially important for China to meet the grand challenge of food security, nutrient-use efficiency and sustainable development.

This study continuously monitored the concentration of PFASs for four seasons in two years in the northwest of Tai Lake Basin. The occurrence, spatiotemporal distribution, seasonal and annual variation, and source apportionment of 13 PFASs were investigated in 60 surface water sampling sites and 33 emission sources. The average concentrations of the total PFASs were 205.6 ng L-1 and 171.9 ng L-1 in 2018 and 2019, respectively. This improvement could be mainly attributed to the local industrial restructuring. Furthermore, principal component analysis and heat map-hierarchical cluster analysis were employed to analyze distribution characteristics and the possible sources of PFASs pollution. It showed that perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOA) mainly originated from the effluents of chemical plants, while the potential source of perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) included all the three types of emission sources. Besides, two indicators were adopted to evaluate the impact of non-point sources and the result showed the effect of runoff was obvious while the effect of atmospheric deposition was weak. A systematic mass balance calculation showed that the total riverine input flux from Wujin District to Tai Lake was 126.5 kg/a.					; Wang, Bin/AAR-5125-2020; Yu, Gang/H-6354-2013	wang, fang/0000-0002-6426-465X; Wang, Bin/0000-0002-6242-7726; 													0304-3894	1873-3336				AUG 15	2021	416								125784	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.125784	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.125784		APR 2021						33865105					WOS:000664751000004

The observed hydro-climate changes are expected to continue and possibly accelerate in the coming century, not only affecting pan-Arctic natural ecosystems and human activities, but also lower latitudes through the atmospheric and ocean circulations. However, a lack of spatiotemporal observational data makes reliable quantification of Arctic hydroclimate change difficult, especially in a long-term context. To understand Arctic hydroclimate and its variability prior to the instrumental record, climate proxy records are needed. The purpose of this review is to summarise the current understanding of Arctic hydroclimate during the past 2000 years. First, the paper reviews the main natural archives and proxies used to infer past hydroclimate variations in this remote region and outlines the difficulty of disentangling the moisture from the temperature signal in these records. Second, a comparison of two sets of hydroclimate records covering the Common Era from two data-rich regions, North America and Fennoscandia, reveals inter- and intra-regional differences. Third, building on earlier work, this paper shows the potential for providing a high-resolution hydroclimate reconstruction for the Arctic and a comparison with last-millennium simulations from fully coupled climate models. In general, hydroclimate proxies and simulations indicate that the Medieval Climate Anomaly tends to have been wetter than the Little Ice Age (LIA), but there are large regional differences. However, the regional coverage of the proxy data is inadequate, with distinct data gaps in most of Eurasia and parts of North America, making robust assessments for the whole Arctic impossible at present. To fully assess pan-Arctic hydroclimate variability for the last 2 millennia, additional proxy records are required.					; Berntsson, Annika/B-3061-2013; Massei, Nicolas/JFJ-1971-2023; Linderholm, Hans/N-1020-2013; Gunnarson, Björn/AAL-1309-2021; Solomina, Olga/J-8353-2013; Yu, Zicheng/D-4108-2012; Debret, Maxime/L-4236-2017	Thomas, Elizabeth/0000-0002-6489-7123; Francus, Pierre/0000-0001-5465-1966; D'Andrea, William/0000-0003-0182-8857; Helama, Samuli/0000-0002-9777-3354; Saarni, Saija/0000-0003-2050-3062; Yu, Zicheng/0000-0003-2358-2712; Linderholm, Hans/0000-0002-1522-8919; Massei, Nicolas/0000-0001-9951-4041; Korhola, Atte A./0000-0003-2577-6502; Nevalainen, Liisa/0000-0001-6837-8753; Luoto, Tomi/0000-0001-6925-3688; 													1814-9324	1814-9332				APR 10	2018	14	4					473	514		10.5194/cp-14-473-2018	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-14-473-2018													WOS:000429564800001

However, due to the limits of big-data calculations for remote sensing, there has been no specific study on the long-term changes in the water bodies in the Yellow River Basin. Thus, in this study, we developed a new combined extraction rule to build an entire annual-scale open-surface water body dataset for 1986-2020 with excellent effectiveness in eliminating the interference of shadows in the Yellow River Basin using all of the available Landsat images. For the first time, the spatial distribution, change trends, conversion processes, and the heterogeneity of the surface water bodies in the Yellow River Basin were analyzed comprehensively to the best of our knowledge. The extraction results had an overall accuracy of 99.70 % and a kappa coefficient of 0.90, which were validated using 34,073 verification points selected on high-resolution Google Earth images and random Landsat images. The total area of water bodies initially decreased (1986-2000) and then increased (2001-2020); however, only the size of the permanent water bodies increased in most areas, while the size of most of the seasonal water bodies decreased. In regions with human-made water bodies, the non-water areas were substantially converted to seasonal and permanent water bodies; however, in areas with natural water bodies, many permanent and seasonal water bodies were gradually converted to non-water areas. Thus, most of the increases in the water bodies occurred in the form of artificial lakes and reservoirs, while most of the decreases in the water body area occurred in natural wetlands and lakes. The areas of both the permanent and seasonal water bodies were positively correlated with precipitation, but only the area of the seasonal water bodies was negatively correlated with temperature.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				NOV 1	2022	845								157152	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157152	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157152		JUL 2022						35803420					WOS:000831583600004

Fluorescence in-situ hybridization and pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes were combined to investigate bacterial diversity and community composition on limnic and coastal marine particles >5 and >10m respectively. Limnic particles were more abundant (average: 1x10(7)l(-1)), smaller in size (average areas: 471 versus 2050m(2)) and more densely colonized (average densities: 7.3 versus 3.6 cells 100m(-2)) than marine ones. Limnic particle-associated (PA) bacteria harboured Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria, and unlike previously suggested sizeable populations of Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Marine particles were colonized by Planctomycetes and Betaproteobacteria additionally to Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Gammaproteobacteria. Large differences in individual particle colonization could be detected. High-throughput sequencing revealed a significant overlap of PA and free-living (FL) bacteria highlighting an underestimated connectivity between both fractions. PA bacteria were in 14/21 cases more diverse than FL bacteria, reflecting a high heterogeneity in the particle microenvironment. We propose that a ratio of Chao 1 indices of PA/FL<1 indicates the presence of rather homogeneously colonized particles. The identification of different bacterial families enriched on either limnic or marine particles demonstrates that, despite the seemingly similar ecological niches, PA communities of both environments differ substantially.

These were linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), nonylphenol (NP), diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), norfloxacin (NOR), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), erythromycin (ERY), bisphenol A (BPA), ofloxacin (OFL), carbamazepine (CBZ), naproxen (NPX), atenolol (ATL) and metoprolol (MET). Their relative risk was ranked based on the proximity between the medians of the reported effect concentrations and measured river or lake water concentrations. The surfactants (LAS) and endocrine disrupting chemicals NP (a breakdown product of the surfactant nonylphenol polyethoxylate) and DEHP (a plasticizer) were identified as posing the greatest risk from this range of chemicals. LAS had a hundred-fold higher risk than any of the pharmaceuticals. The highest risk ranked pharmaceuticals were all antibiotics. Zinc (Zn) and mercury (Hg) were added to the comparison as representative heavy metals. Zn posed a risk higher than all the organics. The risk posed by Hg was less than the surfactants but greater than the selected pharmaceuticals. Whereas LAS and DEHP could cause harmful effects to all the wildlife groups, NP and BPA posed the greatest risk to fish. Antibiotics showed the highest risk to algae. Spatial and temporal distributions of PPCPs and EDCs were conducted for risk identification, source analysis and seasonal change exploration. Municipal sewage effluent linked to urban areas was considered to be the major source of pharmaceuticals. With regard to seasonal influence the risk posed by LAS to the aquatic organisms was significantly affected by wet and dry seasonal change. The dilution effects were the common feature of LAS and ERY risks. The difference in LAS and ERY risk patterns along the rivers was mainly affected by the elimination process. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Martin-Creuzburg, D; Kowarik, C; Straile, D				Martin-Creuzburg, Dominik; Kowarik, Carmen; Straile, Dietmar			Cross-ecosystem fluxes: Export of polyunsaturated fatty acids from aquatic to terrestrial ecosystems via emerging insects	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Cross-ecosystem fluxes can crucially influence the productivity of adjacent habitats. Emerging aquatic insects represent one important pathway through which freshwater-derived organic matter can enter terrestrial food webs. Aquatic insects may be of superior food quality for terrestrial consumers because they contain high concentrations of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). We quantified the export of PUFA via emerging insects from a midsize, mesotrophic lake. Insects were collected using emergence traps installed above different water depths and subjected to fatty acid analyses. Insect emergence from different depth zones and seasonal mean fatty acid concentrations in different insect groups were used to estimate PUFA fluxes. In total, 80.5 mg PUFA m(-2) yr(-1) were exported, of which 32.8 mg m(-2) yr(-1) were eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), 7.8 mg m(-2) yr(-1) were arachidonic acid (ARA), and 2.6 mg m(-2) yr(-1) were docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). While Chironomidae contributed most to insect biomass and total PUFA export, Chaoborus flavicans contributed most to the export of EPA, ARA, and especially DHA. The export of total insect biomass from one square meter declined with depth and the timing at which 50% of total insect biomass emerged was correlated with the water depths over which the traps were installed, suggesting that insect-mediated PUFA fluxes are strongly affected by lake morphometry. Applying a conceptual model developed to assess insect deposition rates on land to our insect-mediated PUFA export data revealed an average total PUFA deposition rate of 150 mg m(-2) yr(-1) within 100 m inland from the shore. We propose that PUFA export can be reliably estimated using taxonspecific information on emergent insect biomass and seasonal mean body PUFA concentrations of adult insects provided here. Our data indicate that insect-mediated PUFA fluxes from lakes are substantial, implying that freshwater-derived PUFA can crucially influence food web processes in adjacent terrestrial habitats.

Sources and Risk Factors for Nitrate and Microbial Contamination of Private Household Wells in the Fractured Dolomite Aquifer of Northeastern Wisconsin	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES												BACKGROUND: Groundwater quality in the Silurian dolomite aquifer in northeastern Wisconsin, USA, has become contentious as dairy farms and exurban development expand. OBJECTIVES: We investigated private household wells in the region, determining the extent, sources, and risk factors of nitrate and microbial contamination. METHODS: Total coliforms, Escherichia coli, and nitrate were evaluated by synoptic sampling during groundwater recharge and no-recharge periods. Additional seasonal sampling measured genetic markers of human and bovine fecal-associated microbes and enteric zoonotic pathogens. We constructed multivariable regression models of detection probability (log-binomial) and concentration (gamma) for each contaminant to identify risk factors related to land use, precipitation, hydrogeology, and well construction. RESULTS: Total coliforms and nitrate were strongly associated with depth-to-bedrock at well sites and nearby agricultural land use, but not septic systems. Both human wastewater and cattle manure contributed to well contamination. Rotavirus group A, Cryptosporidium, and Salmonella were the most frequently detected pathogens. Wells positive for human fecal markers were associated with depth-to-groundwater and number of septic system drainfield within 229 m. Manure-contaminated wells were associated with groundwater recharge and the area size of nearby agricultural land. Wells positive for any fecal-associated microbe, regardless of source, were associated with septic system density and manure storage proximity modified by bedrock depth. Well construction was generally not related to contamination, indicating land use, groundwater recharge, and bedrock depth were the most important risk factors. DISCUSSION: These findings may inform policies to minimize contamination of the Silurian dolomite aquifer, a major water supply for the U.S. and Canadian Great Lakes region.					; Burch, Tucker/F-9840-2012	Muldoon, Maureen/0009-0007-2376-7457; Firnstahl, Aaron/0000-0003-2686-7596; 													0091-6765	1552-9924				JUN	2021	129	6							067004	10.1289/EHP7813	http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/EHP7813								34160249					WOS:000674390100004

JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Lake is an important component of the Earth's surface water bodies. Frequent and serious drought events in lakes have affected the security of regional water resources and caused the degradation of the lake ecosystem. Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, has been suffering from increasingly severe hydrological droughts. This study simulated and investigated the effects of water release from local reservoirs in dry season on hydrological droughts in Poyang Lake based on a hydrodynamic model MIKE 21, and quantified the effectiveness of the joint operation of local reservoirs and the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR). Major results showed that the water level of Poyang Lake during the dry period was significantly raised by the water release from local reservoirs, especially in the northern lake area. The average and the lowest lake level increased from 10.99 m to 11.18-11.59 m and from 9.97 m to 10.14-10.50 m at Xingzi station, respectively. Meanwhile, both the duration of low water and the drought severity/intensity (DS/DI) decreased significantly, with the duration decreasing from 128 days to 105-115 days for typical threshold lake level of 12.0 m, and the DS and DI decreasing from 176.6 m and 1.38 m/day to 117.6-155.3 m and 1.12-1.35 m/day, respectively. Moreover, the release of local reservoirs shortened the exposure duration of beach wetland, from nearly 3 months to about 1.5-2.5 months at the northern channel of Poyang Lake. The area with long exposure duration (>120 days) was also significantly reduced. In addition, the hydrodynamic simulations revealed that the joint operation of local reservoirs and the TGR further raised the average and the lowest lake level and decreased the duration of low water and drought severity and intensity. Outcomes of the study provided valuable references for mitigating lake droughts in complex river-lake-catchment system.

J	Abbasi, S; Turner, A				Abbasi, Sajjad; Turner, Andrew			Sources, concentrations, distributions, fluxes and fate of microplastics in a hypersaline lake: Maharloo, south-west Iran	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Hypersaline lakes support unique ecosystems and biogeochemistries but are often subject to anthropogenic pressures from pollution, water abstraction-diversion and climate change. Less understood, however, are the inputs, distributions and impacts of microplastics (MPs) in hypersaline environments. In this study, MPs are determined in water and sediment cores of Maharloo Lake, south-west Iran, and in the anthropogenically-impacted rivers that recharge the lake. MP concentrations in river water ranged from 0.05 MP L-1 in the headwaters to about 2 MP L-1 downstream of industrial effluents, with intermediate (but elevated) concentrations observed in the lake. The maximum surface concentration in lake sediment cores was about 860 MP kg(-1), and concentrations displayed a progressive reduction with increasing depth down to 50 cm that are qualitatively consistent with temporal changes in plastic production. The size distribution of MPs was skewed towards the finest fraction (< 100 mu m) and the most abundant polymer types were polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene and nylon. Flux calculations using river water data and published atmospheric deposition data for the region reveal that the atmosphere is, by at least an order of magnitude, the more important source. MPs added to the lake appear to be maintained in suspension by high density water but are subsequently deposited to sediments by encapsulation and nucleation as salts precipitate. In addition, it is proposed that direct atmospheric deposition to sediment takes place on areas that seasonally dry out and are subsequently inundated. The impacts of MPs on hypersaline ecosystems and biomass resources are unknown but warrant investigation.					; Turner, Andrew/AAS-1928-2021; Abbasi, Sajjad/AAU-7298-2020	Abbasi, Sajjad/0000-0002-5194-9334; Turner, Andrew/0000-0003-0505-4561; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				JUN 1	2022	823								153721	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153721	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153721		FEB 2022						35149068					WOS:000766797600001

Trophic control changes with season and nutrient loading in lakes	ECOLOGY LETTERS												Experiments have revealed much about top-down and bottom-up control in ecosystems, but manipulative experiments are limited in spatial and temporal scale. To obtain a more nuanced understanding of trophic control over large scales, we explored long-term time-series data from 13 globally distributed lakes and used empirical dynamic modelling to quantify interaction strengths between zooplankton and phytoplankton over time within and across lakes. Across all lakes, top-down effects were associated with nutrients, switching from negative in mesotrophic lakes to positive in oligotrophic lakes. This result suggests that zooplankton nutrient recycling exceeds grazing pressure in nutrient-limited systems. Within individual lakes, results were consistent with a 'seasonal reset' hypothesis in which top-down and bottom-up interactions varied seasonally and were both strongest at the beginning of the growing season. Thus, trophic control is not static, but varies with abiotic conditions - dynamics that only become evident when observing changes over large spatial and temporal scales.					; Stewart, Simon/M-3316-2016	Giron Nava, Alfredo/0000-0002-3433-9251; Symons, Celia C./0000-0003-4120-0327; Stewart, Simon/0000-0003-1916-5481; Rogers, Tanya/0000-0003-1253-9903; Matsuzaki, Shin-ichiro/0000-0003-2744-1343													1461-023X	1461-0248				AUG	2020	23	8					1287	1297		10.1111/ele.13532	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.13532		MAY 2020						32476249					WOS:000536393100001

However, the construction of the Three Gorges Dam has seriously affected the wetland hydrology and landscape. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the landscape dynamics of Dongting Lake wetland and its response to hydrological changes. Based on GEE cloud platform, this paper will obtain the long-term landscape dynamic changes of Dongting Lake wetland and analyze the influence of changes of multi-period water conditions on wetland landscape. The results show that, 1) From 1985 to 2020, the typical vegetation area of Dongting Lake wetland changed obviously on the whole lake scale. The evolution of wetland landscape pattern mainly occurred in East Dongting Lake, west of South Dongting Lake and north of West Dongting Lake. 2) According to the M-K method, the water level data of Dongting Lake showed a sudden change in 2003. This led to the decline of the annual water level of Dongting Lake and the decline of the water level during the wet season and retreating season. 3) The main hydrological variables affecting the change of the area of C. brevicuspis ( Carex brevicuspis ) and P. australis ( Phragmites australis ) in Dongting Lake wetland are the mean water level and minimum water level in wet season, and the mean water level, the minimum water level and the maximum water level in retreating season. This study can be used as a theoretical foundations to protect and restore the wetlands of Dongting Lake and manage the Three Gorges project.						li, jingtai/0000-0003-3597-9274; Luan, Zhaoqing/0000-0002-7648-3657													1642-3593	2080-3397				DEC	2024	24	4					910	919		10.1016/j.ecohyd.2023.04.008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecohyd.2023.04.008		DEC 2024											WOS:001388868800001

Several studies have derived water quality criteria (WQC) for cadmium, but most of these studies did not consider environmental factors. Moreover, few studies considered environmental factors when carrying out ecological risk assessments (ERA) based on environmental factors. In this research, six native aquatic organisms in the Shaying River were adopted to conduct toxicity tests for cadmium. By combining published toxicity data for cadmium with hardness values and toxicity data from this study, hardness-dependent WQC were established. When normalized to a hardness of 100 mg/L CaCO3, the criterion maximum concentration (CMC) of 6.46 mu g/L and criterion continuous concentration (CCC) of 1.49 mu g/L in the Shaying River Basin were derived according to the USEPA guidelines. The acute predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs) derived by species sensitivity distribution (SSD) methods based on log-logistic, log-normal and Burr Type III models were 1.03, 2.41 and 1.66 mu g/L, respectively. Recommended WQC values finally expressed as a function of hardness: (1) CMC = (1.136672-0.041838 x lnH) x e(0.9969xlnH-2.6676); and (2) CCC = (1.101672-0.041838 x lnH) x e(1.0083xlnH-6.1156). In addition, three tiers of ERA of cadmium in surface waters were conducted based on hardness obtained during different seasons in the Shaying River using the hazard quotient (HQ), the margin of safety (MOS10), and the joint probability (JPC) methods. In tiered 1, 2, and 3 ERA, cadmium exposure concentrations were standardized to a hardness of 100 mg/L. The three levels of the ERA method in the tiered framework gave consistent results: the ecological risks of cadmium in the Shaying River Basin were at acceptable levels. The present study provides a reference for the derivation of WQC and risk assessment of pollution affected by differences in aquatic species and water quality factors such as hardness.					; Ding, Ting-ting/ISA-9850-2023; Zhang, Yahui/AAT-9255-2020	Ding, Tingting/0000-0002-4537-9451; Zhang, Jin/0000-0003-0717-8437; 													0147-6513	1090-2414				JUL 15	2020	198								110666	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.110666	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.110666								32361493					WOS:000533505100026

Methane stimulates massive nitrogen loss from freshwater reservoirs in India	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												The fate of the enormous amount of reactive nitrogen released to the environment by human activities in India is unknown. Here we show occurrence of seasonal stratification and generally low concentrations of dissolved inorganic combined nitrogen, and high molecular nitrogen (N-2) to argon ratio, thus suggesting seasonal loss to N-2 in anoxic hypolimnia of several dam-reservoirs. However, N-15-experiments yielded low rates of denitrification, anaerobic ammonium oxidation and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium-except in the presence of methane (CH4) that caused similar to 12-fold increase in denitrification. While nitritedependent anaerobic methanotrophs belonging to the NC10 phylum were present, previously considered aerobic methanotrophs were far more abundant (up to 13.9%) in anoxic hypolimnion. Methane accumulation in anoxic freshwater systems seems to facilitate rapid loss of reactive nitrogen, with generally low production of nitrous oxide (N2O), through widespread coupling between methanotrophy and denitrification, potentially mitigating eutrophication and emissions of CH4 and N2O to the atmosphere.					; Lavik, Gaute/F-6578-2013; Gauns, Mangesh/AAT-9684-2021; Lam, Phyllis/D-9574-2011; Damare, Samir/C-3493-2009; Duret, Manon/ABD-8179-2020	Damare, Samir/0000-0002-4201-4844; Duret, Manon/0000-0002-0922-4372; Lam, Phyllis/0000-0003-2067-171X; Gauns, Mangesh/0000-0002-4737-9252; 													2041-1723					MAR 28	2018	9								1265	10.1038/s41467-018-03607-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-03607-z								29593290					WOS:000428520700009

However, multiple factors controlling their variations in lake sediments hamper the widespread application of brGDGT-based proxies. Here we investigate brGDGTs in water column suspended particulate matter (SPM) and surface sediments in a series of lakes with a wide range of depths from three main volcanic fields of northeastern China. The brGDGT distribution patterns from SPM and surface sediments of these lakes differ greatly from those of surrounding soils, indicating a predominant aquatic origin for brGDGTs. We find that the ratio of 5-methyl hexamethylated and pentamethylated brGDGTs with no cyclopentane rings (IIIa/(IIa + IIIa); designated as HP5) is strongly correlated with water depth. Re-examination of published brGDGT data from SPM samples in redox-stratified Lake Lugano reveals similar relationships, whereas such correlations are much weaker in Lake Superior which does not have an anoxic hypolimnion. Importantly, we find that there is strong correlation between HP5 and dissolved oxygen in water column of the redox-stratified lakes, suggesting that the observed apparent HP5-water depth correlation may be primarily attributed to depth-progressive shifts in the brGDGT-producing bacterial communities with different redox requirements (aerobic, facultative anaerobic, and anaerobic bacteria). Notably, brGDGT methylation indices (MBT'(5ME) and MBT'(6ME)) of surface sediments display poor correlations with air temperatures in our study lakes, calling for caution in applying MBT'(5ME) and MBT'(6ME) as temperature proxies in these lakes.

J	Dong, R; Wang, YY; Lu, C; Lei, GC; Wen, L				Dong, Rui; Wang, Yuyu; Lu, Cai; Lei, Guangchun; Wen, Li			The seasonality of macroinvertebrate β diversity along the gradient of hydrological connectivity in a dynamic river-floodplain system	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Anthropogenic disturbance to natural hydrological connectivity, both longitudinal, lateral, and vertical, is threatening the ecological integrity of the freshwater realm. River-floodplain system is particularly adversely affected by the reduction in lateral hydrological connectivity (LHC), representing one of major biodiversity hotspots under increasingly pressure. Many studies have demonstrated that LHC has great influence on the spatial variations of flora and fauna communities (i.e. spatial beta diversity) through facilitating dispersal. However, to fully understand the impact of anthropogenic disturbances on biodiversity, we must also understand how ecological communities change over time (i.e. temporal beta diversity, TBI) and the underlying processes. To evaluate the processes structuring ecological communities, we examined the macroinvertebrate TBI in habitats along the gradient of LHC for an entire hydrological cycle in West Dongting Lake, a Ramsar-listed floodplain wetland at the middle reach of Yangtze River. Our results showed that the total spatial beta diversity fluctuated with water level and peaked at high-water phase, and LHC was the driving forcing affecting both species richness and abundance in all hydrological periods. In particular, species richness and abundance were highest in habitats with medium LHC levels for water-rising and high-water periods reflecting the intermediate disturbance hypothesis except for water-recessing, during which there was no clear pattern. While replacement determined beta diversity in most sites at water-rising and high-water phases, the contribution of nestedness were high during water-withdrawing phase. From water-rising to high-water, macroinvertebrates from other habitats spread to the modified mudflats, which had the lowest LHC, along with the floods. During water-withdrawing period, beta diversity and its turnover component of all habitats were low compared with other hydrological phases. Temporal beta diversity analysis illustrated that the species dispersal was the main mechanism underlying the temporal and spatial variations in the observed community patterns. These findings demonstrated that hydrological connectivity was critical to maintaining the ecological integrity of river-floodplain ecosystems.					; Rui, Dong/LDG-0179-2024; Guangchun, Lei/ABC-8081-2021	Wang, Yuyu/0000-0003-2081-5277; WEN, LI/0000-0003-3783-3826; Lei, guangchun/0000-0001-9021-5758													1470-160X	1872-7034				FEB	2021	121								107112	10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.107112	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.107112													WOS:000604888100005

A decline in both particulate and dissolved Cs-137 activity concentrations was revealed. The decline rate constants for the particulate Cs-137 activity concentration were found to be higher than for the dissolved Cs-137 activity concentration. In terms of seasonality the dissolved Cs-137 concentrations were higher from June to October, depending on the specific pond and year, most likely due to temperature dependence of Cs-137 desorption from frayed edge sites of micaceous clay minerals. The apparent K-d(Cs-137) in the studied ponds, in absolute value, appeared to be much higher than that for closed and semi-closed lakes of the Chernobyl contaminated area; however, these were comparable to the values characteristic of the rivers and reservoirs of the FDNPP contaminated area. The apparent K-d(Cs-137) in the suspended sediment-water system was observed to decrease over time. It was hypothesized that this trend was associated with the decomposition of glassy hot particles. Relying on the theory of selective sorption and fixation, the exchangeable radiocesium interception potential, RIPex(K) was estimated using data on Cs-137 speciation in the surface bottom-sediment layer and its distribution in the sediment-water system. For the studied ponds, RIPex(K) was on the average 2050 mEq/kg, which is within the range of values measured in laboratory studies reported in the literature. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Tropical cyanobacterial blooms: a review of prevalence, problem taxa, toxins and influencing environmental factors	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Toxic cyanobacterial blooms are a major issue in freshwater systems in many countries. The potentially toxic species and their ecological causes are likely to be different in tropical zones from those in temperate water bodies; however, studies on tropical toxic cyanobacterial blooms are sporadic and currently there is no global synthesis. In this review, we examined published information on tropical cyanobacterial bloom occurrence and toxin production to investigate patterns in their growth and distribution. Microcystis was the most frequently occurring bloom genus throughout tropical Asia, Africa and Central America, while Cylindrospermopsis and Anabaena blooms occurred in various locations in tropical Australia, America and Africa. Microcystis blooms were more prevalent during the wet season while Cylindrospermopsis blooms were more prevalent during the dry period. Microcystin was the most encountered toxin throughout the tropics. A meta-analysis of tropical cyanobacterial blooms showed that Microcystis blooms were more associated with higher total nitrogen concentrations, while Cylindrospermopsis blooms were more associated with higher maximum temperatures. Meta-analysis also showed a positive linear relationship between levels of microcystin and N:P (nitrate:phosphate) ratio. Tropical African Microcystis blooms were found to have the lowest microcystin levels in relation to biomass and N:P (nitrate:phosphate) compared to tropical Asian, Australian and American blooms. There was also no significant correlation between microcystin concentration and cell concentration for tropical African blooms as opposed to tropical Asian and American blooms. Our review illustrates that some cyanobacteria and toxins are more prevalent in tropical areas. While some tropical countries have considerable information regarding toxic blooms, others have few or no reported studies.

Jun; Ma, Bingjie; Jiang, Ping; Li, Siyue			Intense methane diffusive emissions in eutrophic urban lakes, Central China	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Urban lakes are hotspots of methane (CH4) emissions. Yet, actual field measurements of CH4 in these lakes are rather limited and our understanding of CH4 response to urban lake eutrophication is still incomplete. In this study, we measured dissolved CH4 concentrations and quantified CH4 diffusion from four urban lakes in subtropical China during wet and dry seasons. We found that these lakes were constantly CH4-saturated, contributing the greenhouse gas (GHG) to the atmosphere. Nutrient enrichment significantly increased CH4 concentrations and diffusive fluxes. Average CH4 flux rate in the highly-eutrophic lake zones (4.18 +/- 7.68 mmol m-2 d-1) was significantly higher than those in the mesotrophic (0.19 +/- 0.18 mmol m- 2 d-1) and lightly/ moderately-eutrophic zones (0.72 +/- 2.22 mmol m- 2 d-1). Seasonally, CH4 concentrations and fluxes were significantly higher in the wet season than in the dry season in the mesotrophic and the lightly/moderatelyeutrophic lake zones, but an inverse pattern existed in the highly-eutrophic lake zones. CH4 concentrations and fluxes increased with elevated levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The accumulation of nutrients provided autochthonous substrate for methanogenesis, indicated by a negative correlation between CH4 and the C:N ratio. Ammonium-nitrogen (NH4+-N) was the best predictor for spatial fluctuation of CH4 concentrations and diffusive fluxes in the mesotrophic and the lightly/moderately-eutrophic lake zones, while total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) levels showed the highest predictability in the highlyeutrophic lake zones. Based on the findings, we conclude that nutrient enrichment in urban lakes can largely increase CH4 diffusion, and that urban sewage inflow is a key concern for eutrophication boosting CH4 production and diffusive emission. Furthermore, our study reveals that small urban lakes may be an important missing source of GHG emissions in the global C accounting, and that the ratio of littoral-to-pelagic zones can be important for predicting lake-scale estimation of CH4 emission.

However, carbon dioxide (CO2) degassing via water-air interface from inland waters currently has a large uncertainty in estimation. Here we examined the CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) and CO2 degassing in the Daning River, a main tributary of the Yangtze in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) region. The riverine pCO(2 )showed obvious spatial and temporal variations on the main stem and its tributaries, ranging from 483,2 +/- 293.9 mu atm (May) to 2183.3 +/- 1309.2 mu atm (August) with an average of 1198.2 +/- 1122.9 mu atm. pCO(2) increased with the intensive agricultural practices and population on the lower reach of the tributary. The daytime average water-air CO2 flux was 329.8 +/- 470.2 mmol/m(2)/d, and yielded a total CO2 efflux approximately 0.12 Tg CO2/y. The results also indicated that carbon loss via atmospheric exchange accounted for 38.8% of riverine dissolved carbon fluxes. There were close relations between pCO(2) and environmental parameters such as total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) and water temperature in the rainy season, but not in the dry season. Our results demonstrated the essential need to highlight the importance of anthropogenic activities on global and regional CO2 outgassing, and it is urgent to underscore the detailed biogeochemical processes in riverine pCO(2), as well as the couplings between pCO(2) and environmental parameters.					; Li, Siyue/E-8297-2012; Luo, Jiachen/MSW-1769-2025; Lu, Xi/C-5609-2008	maofei, ni/0000-0002-4905-2739; Li, Siyue/0000-0002-3097-6819; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				FEB	2019	569						483	494		10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.12.017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.12.017													WOS:000457952900036
J	Langbehn, TJ; Varpe, O				Langbehn, Tom J.; Varpe, Oystein			Sea-ice loss boosts visual search: fish foraging and changing pelagic interactions in polar oceans	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Light is a central driver of biological processes and systems. Receding sea ice changes the lightscape of high-latitude oceans and more light will penetrate into the sea. This affects bottom-up control through primary productivity and top-down control through vision-based foraging. We model effects of sea-ice shading on visual search to develop a mechanistic understanding of how climate-driven sea-ice retreat affects predator-prey interactions. We adapt a prey encounter model for ice-covered waters, where prey-detection performance of planktivorous fish depends on the light cycle. We use hindcast sea-ice concentrations (past 35years) and compare with a future no-ice scenario to project visual range along two south-north transects with different sea-ice distributions and seasonality, one through the Bering Sea and one through the Barents Sea. The transect approach captures the transition from sub-Arctic to Arctic ecosystems and allows for comparison of latitudinal differences between longitudes. We find that past sea-ice retreat has increased visual search at a rate of 2.7% to 4.2% per decade from the long-term mean; and for high latitudes, we predict a 16-fold increase in clearance rate. Top-down control is therefore predicted to intensify. Ecological and evolutionary consequences for polar marine communities and energy flows would follow, possibly also as tipping points and regime shifts. We expect species distributions to track the receding ice-edge, and in particular expect species with large migratory capacity to make foraging forays into high-latitude oceans. However, the extreme seasonality in photoperiod of high-latitude oceans may counteract such shifts and rather act as a zoogeographical filter limiting poleward range expansion. The provided mechanistic insights are relevant for pelagic ecosystems globally, including lakes where shifted distributions are seldom possible but where predator-prey consequences would be much related. As part of the discussion on photoperiodic implications for high-latitude range shifts, we provide a short review of studies linking physical drivers to latitudinal extent.

Linking landscape heterogeneity with lake dissolved organic matter properties assessed through absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy: Spatial and seasonal patterns in temperate lakes of Southern Andes (Patagonia, Argentina)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Hydrological connectivity between terrestrial and aquatic systems is influenced by landscape features. Topography. vegetation cover and type, lake morphometry and climate (seasonality, precipitation) drive the timing, concentration and quality of allochthonous dissolved organic matter (DOM) inputs to lakes, influencing lake metabolism. The impact of climate changes on terrestrial-aquatic linkages depends on regional trends and ecosystems properties. We examined how landscape heterogeneity affects lake DOM in pristine temperate headwater lakes located in sharp bioclimatic gradients at the leeward side of the southern Andes (Patagonia, Argentina), and predicted their potential responses to forecasted changes in regional climate. We assessed DOM properties of deep and shallow lakes spotted along precipitation and altitudinal gradients which reflect on vegetation heterogeneity. Lake DOM (concentration, and chromophoric and fluorescent properties) was related to terrestrial bioclimatic conditions, addressing also DOM bio- and photodegradation processes. Co-effects of climate and vegetation determined the quantity and quality of allochthonous DOM inputs. Higher terrestrial signs showed up at the wettest extreme of the gradient and during the rainy season, being attributable to higher hydrological land-water connectivity, and dense vegetation cover. Under drier conditions, DOM displayed higher photobleaching signs at spatial and temporal scales. The ratio between non-humic and terrestrial humic substances indicated that DOM biodegradation dominates in shallow forested lakes and photodegradation prevails in deep ones, whereas coupled photo- and biological processing shaped the DOM pool of high altitude lakes. Overall, DOM optical metrics captured landscape heterogeneity. Under the forecasted climate changes for Patagonia (decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature), piedmont lakes may experience lower hydrological connectivity, lower terrestrial inputs and, enhanced photobleaching usually associated with longer water residence time. In high altitude lakes, terrestrial DOM inputs are expected to increase due to the upward expansion of native deciduous forests, thus becoming more similar to lakes located lower in the landscape.

The scales of these maps range from the local (1:600 000) to the regional scale (1:10 000 000). The permafrost classification systems differ among these maps. The indices for permafrost classification used in these mapping projects include spatial continuity (areal extent) and thickness of the permafrost, air and ground temperatures and ground -ice content. All of those data have been retrieved, digitised and published in the Environmental and Ecological Science Data Center for West China. These maps represent the best understanding at the time regarding the distribution of permafrost in China and its changes over the past century. An updated map of permafrost in China, including frozen ground area, is also provided. The total area of permafrost in China is estimated at similar to 1.59 x 10(6) km(2) (glaciers and lakes excluded), and the area of seasonally frozen ground (excluding instantaneous frozen ground) is similar to 5.36 x 10(6) km(2). The total area of high-altitude (plateau and mountain) permafrost in China is similar to 1.35 x 10(6) km(2), the area of mountain permafrost is similar to 0.30 x 10(6) km(2) and the area of plateau permafrost is similar to 1.05 x 10(6)km(2). The latitudinal permafrost is located in the northern part of northeastern China, and its area is similar to 0.24 x 10(6)km(2). Additionally, some suggestions are proposed for future mapping of permafrost in China. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study investigated how lake ice affects the abundance, spatial distribution, and characteristics (size, shape) of MPs in Lake Ulansuhai by analyzing samples collected at ten sites uniformly distributed throughout the lake during ice-free and ice-covered periods. The abundance of MPs ranged between 204 +/- 28 and 1224 +/- 185 n center dot L-1 in lake waters during the ice-free period, and from 34 +/- 8 to 216 +/- 21 n center dot L-1 and 269 +/- 84 to 915 +/- 117 n center dot L-1 in water and ice during the ice-covered period, respectively. During the ice-covered period, MPs were 2.74-8.14 times higher in the ice than in water beneath the ice. Ice formation decreased MP abundance in lake waters, in part, by incorporating a relatively high percentage of MPs into the ice mass during freezing and by inhibiting atmospheric MPs from reaching the lake waters. The abundance of MPs in the water during the ice-free period was 4.50-11.30 times greater than during the ice -covered period. Seasonal variations in MP shape also occurred; the proportion of fibrous MPs in water decreased during the ice-covered period. Variations in MP abundance were partly due to differences in sedi-mentation rates; the settling of fibrous MPs is slower, making it easier for them to be captured during the for-mation of surface ice. Spatially, MPs were uniformly distributed during the ice-free period, but exhibited a spatially distinct pattern during ice-covered periods, when MPs in lake waters were higher in the northeast and lower in the southwest portions of the lake. During the ice-free period, small MPs (0.05-0.5 mm) were more likely to move with currents in the lake, whereas water velocities were reduced by ice formation, allowing small MPs to accumulate near the lake inlet.					shi, XIAOHONG/KRP-1855-2024; Li, Wenbao/HQZ-4391-2023; Liu, Yu/HNQ-3822-2023														0269-7491	1873-6424				APR 15	2023	323								121268	10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121268	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121268		FEB 2023						36780975					WOS:000948494300001

However, in recent years, the level of uncertainty in the existing LLTS forecast methods has increased significantly due to climate change, therefore, the need to develop more accurate models. The main research question for this study is whether it is necessary to use nonlinear methods in LLTS modeling or if linear methods can produce as accurate and reliable forecast tools. We introduce a new linear-based forecast method for LLTS using spectral analysis, seasonal standardization, and stochastic terms. The application of the new LLTS forecast method is tested on two case study Lakes, including the Van Lake, in Turkey and the Michigan-Huron Lake, in North America. A two-step preprocessing techniques based on standardization and differencing was used for the Van Lake, and spectral analysis and differencing was employed for the Michigan-Huron Lake. We then compared the accuracy and uncertainty of the proposed linear method with an artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) methods. The uncertainty of the new linear LLTS forecast model was +/- 0.00455 and +/- 0.00264 for the Van Lake and the Michigan-Huron Lake, respectively, compared to +/- 0.00625 and +/- 0.00766 for the ANN and the ANFIS (respectively) at the Van Lake and +/- 0.00312 and +/- 0.00319 for the ANN and the ANFIS (respectively) at the Michigan-Huron Lake.

There have been extensive measurements and modeling efforts devoted to estimating the exchange fluxes between the atmosphere and various surfaces (e.g., soil, canopies, water, snow, etc.) in the past three decades. However, large uncertainties remain due to the complexity of Hg-0 bidirectional exchange, limitations of flux quantification techniques and challenges in model parameterization. In this study, we provide a critical review on the state of science in the atmosphere-surface exchange of Hg-0. Specifically, the advancement of flux quantification techniques, mechanisms in driving the air-surface Hg exchange and modeling efforts are presented. Due to the semi-volatile nature of Hg-0 and redox transformation of Hg in environmental media, Hg deposition and evasion are influenced by multiple environmental variables including seasonality, vegetative coverage and its life cycle, temperature, light, moisture, atmospheric turbulence and the presence of reactants (e.g., O-3, radicals, etc.). However, the effects of these processes on flux have not been fundamentally and quantitatively determined, which limits the accuracy of flux modeling. We compile an up-to-date global observational flux database and discuss the implication of flux data on the global Hg budget. Mean Hg-0 fluxes obtained by micrometeorological measurements do not appear to be significantly greater than the fluxes measured by dynamic flux chamber methods over unpolluted surfaces (p = 0.16, one-tailed, Mann-Whitney U test). The spatiotemporal coverage of existing Hg-0 flux measurements is highly heterogeneous with large data gaps existing in multiple continents (Africa, South Asia, Middle East, South America and Australia). The magnitude of the evasion flux is strongly enhanced by human activities, particularly at contaminated sites. Hg-0 flux observations in East Asia are comparatively larger in magnitude than the rest of the world, suggesting substantial re-emission of previously deposited mercury from anthropogenic sources. The Hg-0 exchange over pristine surfaces (e.g., background soil and water) and vegetation needs better constraints for global analyses of the atmospheric Hg budget. The existing knowledge gap and the associated research needs for future measurements and modeling efforts for the air-surface exchange of Hg-0 are discussed.

As a result, the increase in diseases and the use of antibiotics to control them during the production cycle has been documented. We study the impact of antibiotics on drinking water, trout tissues and the lake's aquatic ecosystem. Nine antibiotics were monitored: tetracyclines, sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones. The samples were collected randomly and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and the solid-phase extraction system. The sediment samples and surface water samples contain high concentrations of antibiotics. All sediments contain fluoroquinolones (3.74 mg kg(-1)) and tetracyclines (3.08 mg kg-1) and the surface water contains fluoroquinolones of up to 408.2 and 652.7 ng L-1 in the dry and rainy seasons respectively (P > 0.05). Drinking water samples from the city of Puno collected at sampling points with Lake Titicaca as a source of drinking water, reached an average of 188.1 and 222.2 ng L-1 of ciprofloxacin in dry and rainy seasons respectively. Complementarily, in trout tissues, it reached 7.8 lg kg(-1) in oxytetracycline 8.7 lg kg(-1) in sulfatizole, 4.2 lg kg(-1) in ciprofloxacin and 3.6 lg kg(-1) in sarafloxacin. The presence of these antibiotics in surface water is attributed to the aquaculture activity, in addition to runoff and wastewater, and their presence can have detrimental effects on the aquatic ecosystem, and even affect public health due to the consumption of aquaculture products and drinking water contaminated with antibiotic residues.

J	Xu, HY; George, SC; Hou, DJ				Xu, Huiyuan; George, Simon C.; Hou, Dujie			Algal-derived polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Paleogene lacustrine sediments from the Dongying Depression, Bohai Bay Basin, China	MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY												The sources and origins of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in thirty eight Paleogene organic-rich shales and mudstones from the Shahejie Formation in the Dongying Depression, Bohai Bay Basin have been assessed. Phenanthrene, retene, cadalene, fluoranthene, pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, triphenylene, chrysene, benzofluoranthenes, benzo[e]pyrene, benzo[a]pyrene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, benzo[ghi]perylene and coronene were identified in the sediments. The symmetrical 4-ring triphenylene was unequivocally identified by comparison with mass spectra and a synthetic standard. Key PAH ratios including fluoranthene/(fluoranthene + pyrene), benzo[a]anthracene/(benz[a]anthracene + chrysene), indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene/(indeno (1,2,3-cd]pyrene + benzo[ghi]perylene) and benzofluoranthene/(benzofluoranthene + benzo[e]pyrene) indicate a mainly diagenetic/catagenetic origin for the PAHs. The relative low abundance of the 6-ring indeno [1,2,3-cd]pyrene and benzo[ghi]perylene and the 7-ring coronene suggest the absence of larger, high temperature wildfires, either due to inadequate seasonality of the humid-arid climate, or limited terrigenous organic matter input. Phenanthrene and alkylphenanthrenes are likely derived from phytoplankton, based on the correlation of the relative abundance of C-27 regular steranes and 1-methylphenanthrene and 9-methyiphenanthrene. The methylphenanthrenes, triphenylene, alkyltriphenylenes and benzo[e]pyrene may share a common source as their occurrences are closely correlated. Four groups of samples were differentiated on the basis of the relative abundance and distribution patterns of benz[a]anthracene, triphenylene and chrysene, showing that these compounds are useful PAH markers in petroleum geochemistry. Thermal maturation effects are the major control on the relative abundance and distribution of the non-combustion derived PAHs (e.g. biphenyl, fluorene, fluoranthene, pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, triphenylene) in lacustrine sediments. Ben[a]anthracene decreases in relative abundance while triphenylene increases in relative abundance with burial depth. Correlation of the newly defined triphenylene-chrysene ratio (TCR; triphenylene/(triphenylene + chrysene) with burial depth and biomarker maturity parameters was observed, suggesting that it may be a useful maturity indicator for lacustrine oils and sediments in the Dongying Depression.

J	Urrutia-Cordero, P; Zhang, H; Chaguaceda, F; Geng, H; Hansson, LA				Urrutia-Cordero, Pablo; Zhang, Huan; Chaguaceda, Fernando; Geng, Hong; Hansson, Lars-Anders			Climate warming and heat waves alter harmful cyanobacterial blooms along the benthic-pelagic interface	ECOLOGY												In addition to a rise in mean air and water temperatures, more frequent and intense extreme climate events (such as heat waves) have been recorded around the globe during the past decades. These environmental changes are projected to intensify further in the future, and we still know little about how they will affect ecological processes driving harmful cyanobacterial bloom formation. Therefore, we conducted a long-term experiment in 400-L shallow freshwater mesocosms, where we evaluated the effects of a constant +4 degrees C increase in mean water temperatures and compared it with a fluctuating warming scenario ranging from 0 to +8 degrees C (i.e., including heat waves) but with the same +4 degrees C long-term elevation in mean water temperatures. We focused on investigating not only warming effects on cyanobacterial pelagic dynamics (phenology and biomass levels), but also on their recruitment from sediments-which are a fundamental part of their life history for which the response to warming remains largely unexplored. Our results demonstrate that (1) a warmer environment not only induces a seasonal advancement and boosts biomass levels of specific cyanobacterial species in the pelagic environment, but also increases their recruitment rates from the sediments, and (2) these species-specific benthic and pelagic processes respond differently depending on whether climate warming is expressed only as an increase in mean water temperatures or, in addition, through an increased warming variability (including heat waves). These results are important because they show, for the first time, that climate warming can affect cyanobacterial dynamics at different life-history stages, all the way from benthic recruitment up to their establishment in the pelagic community. Furthermore, it also highlights that both cyanobacterial benthic recruitment and pelagic biomass dynamics may be different as a result of changes in the variability of warming conditions. We argue that these findings are a critical first step to further our understanding of the relative importance of increased recruitment rates for harmful cyanobacterial bloom formation under different climate change scenarios.					; chaguaceda, fernando/AAO-2991-2020; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022	Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; Urrutia Cordero, Pablo/0000-0001-9560-8374; Chaguaceda, Fernando/0000-0002-0827-2110													0012-9658	1939-9170				JUL	2020	101	7								10.1002/ecy.3025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3025		MAR 2020						32083737					WOS:000520821300001

Melting glaciers are known as a secondary source of pollutants, but the dynamics and release features of water-soluble emerging chemicals have not been studied in the TP. Glacial ice and snow, meltwater runoff, rain, and lake water were collected in Nam Co basin, in the central TP. The total concentrations of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) were 1,413 pg/L for glacial ice, followed by 1,277 pg/L for meltwater runoff, 980 pg/L for lake water, and 616 pg/L for rain. Perfluorobutanoic acid is dominant in runoff and glacial ice, while lake water contained high proportions of perfluorobutane sulfonate and perfluorooctane sulfonate. During the melting season, meltwater runoff generally had greater PFAAs concentrations, and the PFAAs release fluxes were strongly related to the glacial melt intensity. Due to the direct input of PFAAs by melted glaciers, south shore of Lake Nam Co contained higher PFAAs concentrations. The estimated input fluxes of PFAAs to the lake by rain and glacial and nonglacial runoff were 1,425, 1,342, and 2,192 mg/day, respectively. Taken together, these evidences suggest that melting glaciers are sources of PFAAs, while the lake is the receptor. Given the continuity of glacial melt and high concentrations of water-soluble emerging pollutants in glacier, the melting process will increase the risks of emerging pollutants to freshwater sources and should be of great concern.

We assessed impacts of cyanobacterial bloom intensity on plankton ecosystem functioning using eukaryotic phytoplankton and zooplankton indicators and associated key physicochemical data collected from four seasons of two years at 24 evenly distributed sites in Lake Taihu that has year-around cyanobacterial blooms. Our analyses involved comparison of four site-groups with different bloom intensities and analyzing all sampling sites together using comparison, hierarchical partitioning analysis, generalized additive mixed model, and structural equation model. We found that cyanobacterial abundance positively associated with TP and temperature (negatively with TN:TP), while phytoplankton positively associated with TN. There was an inverse relation trend between relative abundances of phytoplankton and cyanobacteria, but there was no clear trend between absolute abundances of phytoplankton and cyanobacteria. Rotifers were most dominant when cyanobacteria were unabundant, while cladocerans presented higher abundance when cyanobacteria were in high abundance. Phytoplankton functional richness and species richness negatively and zooplankton functional richness and species richness positively associated with cyanobacterial bloom intensity. Cyanobacterial bloom intensity negatively associated with resource use efficiencies (RUEs) of phytoplankton and rotifers, and positively associated with RUE of cladocerans. Our analytical approach of integrating comparison of site-groups and analyzing all sites together uncovered how cyanobacterial bloom intensity shifted and altered physicochemical and biological conditions and plankton ecosystem functioning, and identified the mechanism and strength of the interactive linkages among physicochemical and biological indicators. Although our results may be different from oligotrophic lakes or reservoirs, our findings provide new insights in understanding the impacts of cyanobacterial bloom intensity on the dynamics of plankton communities and ecosystem functioning for polymictic eutrophic lakes, which may have broad application in enhancing the knowledge of this subject and provides the science base for managing polymictic eutrophic lake water quality and ecosystem functioning.

Ruby			A Physically Based Runoff Routing Model for Land Surface and Earth System Models	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												A new physically based runoff routing model, called the Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport (MOSART), has been developed to be applicable across local, regional, and global scales. Within each spatial unit, surface runoff is first routed across hillslopes and then discharged along with subsurface runoff into a "tributary subnetwork'' before entering the main channel. The spatial units are thus linked via routing through the main channel network, which is constructed in a scale-consistent way across different spatial resolutions. All model parameters are physically based, and only a small subset requires calibration. MOSART has been applied to the Columbia River basin at 1/16 degrees, 1/88 degrees, 1/4 degrees, and 1/2 degrees spatial resolutions and was evaluated using naturalized or observed streamflow at a number of gauge stations. MOSART is compared to two other routing models widely used with land surface models, the River Transport Model (RTM) in the Community Land Model (CLM) and the Lohmann routing model, included as a postprocessor in the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model package, yielding consistent performance at multiple resolutions. MOSART is further evaluated using the channel velocities derived from field measurements or a hydraulic model at various locations and is shown to be capable of producing the seasonal variation and magnitude of channel velocities reasonably well at different resolutions. Moreover, the impacts of spatial resolution on model simulations are systematically examined at local and regional scales.

During farming seasons of the whole year, cumulated CO2-C fluxes were -5.69 g m(-2) (5) and 11.23 g m(-2) (SS), respectively. The cumulated CO2 emissions from S and SS did not differ significantly. The cumulated CH4-C emissions from S (0.57 g m(-2)) were significantly higher than those from SS (0.068 g m(-2)). S absorbed C from the atmosphere with a mean absorption rate of -5.12 g m(-2), whereas SS emitted C to the atmosphere with a mean emission rate of 11.30 g m(-2). Over 20-year horizon, the compressive global warming potentials (cGWPs) were 33.55 (S) and 47.71 (SS), respectively, indicating both feeding and no-feeding mariculture ponds could promote global warming.

J	Li, YL; Zhang, Q; Liu, XG; Tan, ZQ; Yao, J				Li, Yunliang; Zhang, Qi; Liu, Xinggen; Tan, Zhiqiang; Yao, Jing			The role of a seasonal lake groups in the complex Poyang Lake-floodplain system (China): Insights into hydrological behaviors	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Seasonal lakes that exist in floodplain settings have significant effects on hydrological and ecological processes and are highly susceptible to various changes; however, they are rarely investigated, mainly because of the large extent and remoteness of floodplains. This study uses physically based hydrodynamic modeling in combination with a bathymetry adjustment approach to investigate the coupling effects of 77 seasonal lakes (defined as the seasonal lake group) on hydrological behaviors within the Poyang Lake-floodplain system (China) from a systemic perspective. Elucidation of the role of seasonal lake groups could benefit from hydrodynamic modeling, which enables complex lake-floodplain simulations and comparison analyses of natural (original bathymetry) and hypothetical conditions (adjusted bathymetry). In the present study, the simulation results showed that the temporal influences of the seasonal lake group on water levels, lake outflows, and inundation dynamics were greater during dry seasons than wet seasons for both the dry (2006) and wet years (2010). The spatial effects of the seasonal lake group on the hydrology of the lake's floodplains were stronger than those of the main lake for both hydrological years. The findings demonstrate that the seasonal lakes are likely to have very limited effects on the main lake and the associated flood levels. On average, the role of the seasonal lake group during the dry seasons was around several times stronger than that during flood seasons in terms of the magnitudes of hydrological responses. Additionally, it is expected that the seasonal lake group may exert an important role in influencing the surface hydrological connectivity and associated dry-wet hydrological shift across lake-floodplains, indicating a dominant role of the floodplain bathymetry changes. Overall, the results of this study will support management and planning of Poyang Lake and other similar floodplain regions with numerous small, shallow, and seasonal lakes by providing more reliable information regarding bathymetry changes, water management and lake-floodplain interactions to decision-makers for improved floodplain protection strategy.					; xinggen, liu/AAQ-6640-2020; ZHANG, Qi/MFJ-8647-2025	Li, Yunliang/0000-0002-0708-9138; Liu, Xinggen/0000-0002-0252-0558; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				NOV	2019	578								124055	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124055	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124055													WOS:000497250200032

Understanding the source and behaviour of N around plateau lakes is essential for improving groundwater and lake water quality. This study used NO3- stable isotopes (delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3-) combined with hydrochemical data, environmental parameters and a Bayesian stable isotope mixing model (SIAR) to elaborate the NO3- sources and contributions and N concentrations and cycling processes in groundwater (n = 476) from 8 plateau lake basins in regard to land uses and seasonal changes. We found that multiple N form concentrations in the rainy season (RS) and cropland (CA) were higher than those in the dry season (DS) and residential area (RA); NO3--N was the most dominant N form, and 45% of groundwater samples exceeded the WHO NO3- drinking water threshold. The NO3- isotopes and SIAR model revealed that soil N (SN), manure and sewage (M&S) and N fertilizer (NF) were the main NO3- sources in groundwater, contributing 47.5%, 30.5% and 19.5% based on land uses and 39.0%, 37.5% and 20.0% based on seasonal changes, respectively. Moreover, denitrification was considered the primary N transformation process in the groundwater in the RS, CA and RA, but the N transformation process in the DS was dominated by nitrification. These results indicated that N concentration and source varied with land use and seasonal changes, and the cross distribution of CA and RA and difference in seasonal rainfall resulted in the difference in multiple N sources and source contributions in groundwater. Despite changes in land uses and seasons, SN and M&S remain the largest NO3- contributors to groundwater, which poses new challenges to control groundwater NO3- pollution in the area around plateau lakes with a cross distribution of CA and RA. Therefore, improving septic tanks and sewage networks and scientific soil N management are essential for controlling groundwater pollution.					wang, yi/HTM-0992-2023														0022-1694	1879-2707				MAY	2023	620		B						129541	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129541	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129541		APR 2023											WOS:000989277500001

Here we show that most endorheic lakes on the western TP exhibited considerable water level increase during the ice-covered period, which contrasts with lakes in other regions of the TP. An analysis of lake water balance attributes this water surplus to significant groundwater inflow, which is estimated to be about 59%-66% of total inflow into lakes. The groundwater inflow occurred after the 2000s, which is consistent with the rapid lake expansion and significant increase in precipitation. We suggest that the groundwater inflow is mainly related to large-scale active faults in the limestone bedrock and sufficient meltwater from high elevations. Our results imply that groundwater may be deeply involved in the water cycle and modify the seasonal and inter-annual lake variations on the western TP.					; Yang, Kun/G-8390-2011; Immerzeel, Walter/E-2489-2012	Li, Zhiguo/0000-0002-9474-366X; Yang, Kun/0000-0002-0809-2371; Peiping, Song/0000-0001-7589-7789													0094-8276	1944-8007				OCT 28	2022	49	20							e2022GL099268	10.1029/2022GL099268	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022GL099268													WOS:000868691200001

Accordingly, we investigated the relationships between Urmia Lake drying-up and PM10 concentration in Tabriz by 3D visualization of space-time cube in ArcGIS pro 2.7. So, Satellite images of the lake and PM10 data were collected. Next, a spacetime cube was created for each season of the lake and PM10 during 2004 to 2019. Then Time series analysis, Emerging hot spot analysis and 3D visualization of these cubes were performed. The results showed that there is a clear relationship between drying-up of the lake and increasing of PM10 in Tabriz and we recognized that the drying-up has a significant impact on increasing of PM10 concentration in Tabriz.					; Arab-Ahmadi, Mehran/AAH-6876-2021; Ahmadi, Hamed/IWV-0834-2023	Argany, Meysam/0000-0001-6577-4443; 													2210-6707	2210-6715				JAN	2022	76								103399	10.1016/j.scs.2021.103399	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2021.103399		OCT 2021											WOS:000717465800006

It is possible that mutualistic relationships exist between bacteria and cyanobacteria in these CAs wherein bacterial products supplement cyanobacterial growth, and cyanobacterial exudates, in turn, serve as substrates for bacteria, thus augmenting the stability of each constituent. However, little is known about the exact interaction between cyanobacteria and their attached bacteria in CAs. Therefore, in this study, we collected 26 CA samples from Lake Taihu, a large freshwater lake in China from March of 2015 to February of 2016. We then sequenced both the V4 regions of 16S rRNA genes and full metagenomes, resulting in 610 Mb of 16S rRNA gene data and 198.98 Gb of high-quality metagenomic data. We observed that two cyanobacteria genera (Microcystis and Dolichospermum) alternately dominated CAs along the sampling time and specific bacterial genera attached to different cyanobacteria genera dominated CAs. More specifically, Dolichospermum dominates CAs when water temperature is low and total nitrogen is high, while Microcystis dominates CAs when water temperature is high and total nitrogen is low. Moreover, we found specific bacterial genera attached to different cyanobacteria genera dominated CAs. The cyanobacteria-bacteria related pairs Dolichospermum-Burkholderia and Microcystis-Hyphomonas were detected by ecological networks construction. Bacterial communities in CAs were found to be more correlated with the cyanobacterial community (Mantel's r = 0.76, P = 0.001) than with environmental factors (Mantel's r = 0.27, P = 0.017). A potential codependent nitrogen-cycling pathway between cyanobacteria and their attached bacteria was constructed, indicating their functional link Overall, these results demonstrated that mutualistic relationships do, indeed, exist between cyanobacteria and bacteria in CAs at both taxonomic and gene levels, providing biological clues potentially leading to the control of blooms by interventional strategies to disrupt bacteria-cyanobacteria relationships and co-pathways.

Under the impacts of urbanization and climate change, understanding urban lake-water extent dynamics is significant. However, few studies on the lake-water extent changes for the Wuhan urban agglomeration exist. This research employed 1375 seasonally continuous Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI data scenes to evaluate the lake-water extent changes from 1987 to 2015. The random forest model was used to extract water bodies based on eleven feature variables, including six remote-sensing spectral bands and five spectral indices. An accuracy assessment yielded a mean classification accuracy of 93.11%, with a standard deviation of 2.26%. The calculated results revealed the following: (1) The average maximum lake-water area of the Wuhan urban agglomeration was 2262.17 km(2) from 1987 to 2002, and it decreased to 2020.78 km(2) from 2005 to 2015, with a loss of 241.39 km(2) (10.67%). (2) The lake-water areas of loss of Wuhan, Huanggang, Xianning, and Xiaogan cities, were 114.83 km(2), 44.40 km(2), 45.39 km(2), and 31.18 km(2), respectively, with percentages of loss of 14.30%, 11.83%, 13.16%, and 23.05%, respectively. (3) The lake-water areas in the Wuhan urban agglomeration were 226.29 km(2), 322.71 km(2), 460.35 km(2), 400.79 km(2), 535.51 km(2), and 635.42 km(2) under water inundation frequencies of 5%-10%, 10%-20%, 20%-40%, 40%-60%, 60%-80%, and 80%-100%, respectively. The Wuhan urban agglomeration was approved as the pilot area for national comprehensive reform, for promoting resource-saving and environmentally friendly developments. This study could be used as guidance for lake protection and water resource management.					; Jiang, Weiguo/KEH-1943-2024; Jia, Kai/AGH-8567-2022	Jiang, Weiguo/0000-0002-1352-1046; lv, jinxia/0000-0002-8762-3950														2072-4292				MAR	2017	9	3							270	10.3390/rs9030270	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs9030270													WOS:000398720100084

There are a large number of thermokarst lakes distributed in the ice-rich permafrost region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. However, the effect of the spatial distribution of thermokarst lakes on permafrost degradation at a regional-scale in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is not fully understood. Time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar is an established remotely-sensing tool to measure surface deformation in permafrost regions, and has been widely used in permafrost degradation investigation. In this study, we characterized spatial-temporal variations of surface deformation in the Beiluhe Basin in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau with time series InSAR analysis, and extracted thermokarst lakes from Landset-8 images. Additionally, MODIS land surface temperature data and Stefan model were used to estimate the active layer thickness of permafrost in the basin. Results showed that the linear subsidence rate in the permafrost region within the basin generally exceeded 5 mm/yr, with a seasonal deformation amplitude of >10 mm, and the active layer thickness ranged from 2.1 m to 3.5 m. We found that permafrost degradation was concentrated in the areas with a high density of thermokarst lakes. Specifically, the density of thermokarst lakes was positively correlated with the linear subsidence rate and the seasonal deformation amplitude, and the larger active layer thickness clustered significantly in the area of thermokarst lakes. We also found that accelerated thermokarst collapse of the lake shore intensified the development of thermokarst lakes, and the lake expansion further aggravated the permafrost deformation. In addition, there is a strongly negative correlation (r = -0.78) between active layer thickness and Normalized Difference Vegetative Index in the basin, inferring that the degradation of permafrost may lead to the transformation from alpine meadow to alpine grassland and alpine desert.					zhou, zhiwei/J-7878-2015; Huang, Ronggang/Y-9451-2019; Jiang, Liming/O-1776-2013	Jiang, Liming/0000-0002-1127-9823; Guo, Rui/0000-0002-4402-5010; xu, zhida/0009-0002-8089-9628; 													0169-555X	1872-695X				MAR 15	2023	425								108582	10.1016/j.geomorph.2023.108582	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2023.108582		JAN 2023											WOS:000973481600001

However, few studies have provided such insights in these characteristic or quantified different water environment responses to NPS pollution. In this study, an integrated modelling approach was developed for those complex catchments by combining three commonly used models: SWMM (Storm Water Management Model), SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) and MIKE 11. A case study was performed in a typical urban-rural catchment of Chao Lake, China. The simulated results indicated that urban NPS pollution responded sensitively to rainfall events and was greatly affected by the antecedent dry days. Compare to urban NPS, agricultural NPS pollution was characterized with the time-lag to rainfall depended on soil moisture and the post-rain-season emissions carried by lateral flows, and were also affected by the local farm-practice schedule. With comprehensive impacts from urban-rural land-uses, the time-interleaved urban and agricultural NPS pollution emissions and more abundant pollution accumulation both led to a decrease in the responsive time and an increase in the frequency of peak pollution concentration values even during the dry season. These obtained characteristics can provide guidance for drafting watershed management plans in similar mixed land use catchments. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Determining water storage depletion within Iran by assimilating GRACE data into the W3RA hydrological model	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES												Groundwater depletion, due to both unsustainable water use and a decrease in precipitation, has been reported in many parts of Iran. In order to analyze these changes during the recent decade, in this study, we assimilate Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) data from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) into the World-Wide Water Resources Assessment (W3RA) model. This assimilation improves model derived water storage simulations by introducing missing trends and correcting the amplitude and phase of seasonal water storage variations. The Ensemble Square-Root Filter (EnSRF) technique is applied, which showed stable performance in propagating errors during the assimilation period (2002-2012). Our focus is on sub-surface water storage changes including groundwater and soil moisture variations within six major drainage divisions covering the whole Iran including its eastern part (East), Caspian Sea, Centre, Sarakhs, Persian Gulf and Oman Sea, and Lake Urmia. Results indicate an average of -8.9 mm/year groundwater reduction within Iran during the period 2002 to 2012. A similar decrease is also observed in soil moisture storage especially after 2005. We further apply the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) technique to relate sub-surface water storage changes to climate (e.g., precipitation) and anthropogenic (e.g., farming) impacts. Results indicate an average correlation of 0.81 between rainfall and groundwater variations and also a large impact of anthropogenic activities (mainly for irrigations) on Iran's water storage depletions.

Dissolved organic carbon and major and trace elements in peat porewater of sporadic, discontinuous, and continuous permafrost zones of western Siberia	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Mobilization of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and related trace elements (TEs) from the frozen peat to surface waters in the permafrost zone is expected to enhance under ongoing permafrost thaw and active layer thickness (ALT) deepening in high-latitude regions. The interstitial soil solutions are efficient tracers of ongoing bio-geochemical processes in the critical zone and can help to decipher the intensity of carbon and metals migration from the soil to the rivers and further to the ocean. To this end, we collected, across a 640 km latitudinal transect of the sporadic to continuous permafrost zone of western Siberia peatlands, soil porewaters from 30 cm depth using suction cups and we analyzed DOC, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and 40 major elements and TEs in 0.45 mu m filtered fraction of 80 soil porewaters. Despite an expected decrease in the intensity of DOC and TE mobilization from the soil and vegetation litter to the interstitial fluids with the increase in the permafrost coverage and a decrease in the annual temperature and ALT, the DOC and many major and trace elements did not exhibit any distinct decrease in concentration along the latitudinal transect from 62.2 to 67.4 degrees N. The DOC demonstrated a maximum of concentration at 66 degrees N, on the border of the discontinuous/continuous permafrost zone, whereas the DOC concentration in peat soil solutions from the continuous permafrost zone was equal to or higher than that in the sporadic/discontinuous permafrost zone. Moreover, a number of major (Ca, Mg) and trace (Al, Ti, Sr, Ga, rare earth elements (REEs), Zr, Hf, Th) elements exhibited an increasing, not decreasing, northward concentration trend. We hypothesize that the effects of temperature and thickness of the ALT are of secondary importance relative to the leaching capacity of peat, which is in turn controlled by the water saturation of the peat core. The water residence time in peat pores also plays a role in enriching the fluids in some elements: the DOC, V, Cu, Pb, REEs, and Th were a factor of 1.5 to 2.0 higher in mounds relative to hollows. As such, it is possible that the time of reaction between the peat and downward infiltrating waters essentially controls the degree of peat porewater enrichments in DOC and other solutes. A 2 degrees northward shift in the position of the permafrost boundaries may bring about a factor of 1.3 +/- 0.2 decrease in Ca, Mg, Sr, Al, Fe, Ti, Mn, Ni, Co, V, Zr, Hf, Th, and REE porewater concentration in continuous and discontinuous permafrost zones, and a possible decrease in DOC, specific ultraviolet absorbency (SUVA), Ca, Mg, Fe, and Sr will not exceed 20% of their current values. The projected increase in ALT and vegetation density, northward migration of the permafrost boundary, or the change of hydrological regime is unlikely to modify chemical composition of peat porewater fluids larger than their natural variations within different micro-landscapes, i.e., within a factor of 2. The decrease in DOC and metal delivery to small rivers and lakes by peat soil leachate may also decrease the overall export of dissolved components from the continuous permafrost zone to the Arctic Ocean. This challenges the current paradigm on the increase in DOC export from the land to the ocean under climate warming in high latitudes.

Many of these lakes are in tropical cyclone strike zones and they experience high inter-seasonal and inter-annual variation in rainfall and runoff. Both of those factors strongly modulate sediment-water column interactions, which play a critical role in shallow lake nutrient cycling, water column irradiance characteristics and cyanobacterial harmful algal bloom (CyanoHAB) dynamics. We illustrate this with three examples, using long-term (15-25 years) datasets on water quality and plankton from three shallow lakes: Lakes Okeechobee and George (Florida, USA) and Lake Taihu (China). Okeechobee and Taihu have been impacted repeatedly by tropical cyclones that have resulted in large amounts of runoff and sediment resuspension, and resultant increases in dissolved nutrients in the water column. In both cases, when turbidity declined, major blooms of the toxic CyanoHAB Microcystis aeruginosa occurred over large areas of the lakes. In Lake George, periods of high rainfall resulted in high dissolved color, reduced irradiance, and increased water turnover rates which suppress blooms, whereas in dry periods with lower water color and water turnover rates there were dense cyanobacteria blooms. We identify a suite of factors which, from our experience, will determine how a particular shallow lake will respond to a future with global warming, flashier rainfall, prolonged droughts and stronger tropical cyclones.

Zooplankton as an alternative method for controlling phytoplankton in catfish pond aquaculture	AQUACULTURE REPORTS												In pond aquaculture, production of toxins and off-flavor compounds by cyanobacteria can negatively affect fish health and production. Studies have explored chemical or physical methods for controlling algal blooms in aquaculture ponds, which although effective, may be short-lived and can negatively impact non-target organisms, including aquaculture species. Food web manipulations have a long history in lake and fisheries management to improve water quality, but have been rarely considered in aquaculture. This study examined zooplankton and phytoplankton communities, cyanobacterial toxins, and nutrients in nine catfish aquaculture farm-ponds in west Alabama, USA. The goal of this project was to track phytoplankton and zooplankton abundances with respect to each other, with and without efforts to reduce zooplanktivorous fish in some of the ponds. During this project, farm managers reduced zooplanktivorous fish abundance in select ponds to create a large-scale field experiment that addressed the role of zooplankton control of phytoplankton in hypereutrophic catfish aquaculture ponds when zooplanktivorous fish were or were not excluded. There was a strong negative effect of zooplankton on phytoplankton, including cyanobacteria, despite high nutrient concentrations. Although high zooplankton ponds sustained elevated zooplankton biomass during much of this study, including when pond temperatures exceeded 30 degrees C, the effect of zooplankton on phytoplankton was most pronounced during the nongrowing season (November-April). In addition, total ammonia nitrogen was significantly higher in high zooplankton ponds, which could lead to ammonia toxicity in fish at elevated temperature and pH. Our findings suggest that zooplankton biomanipulation may be an efficient method to control algal blooms in farm-pond catfish aquaculture.

In the present study, 364 samples were collected during four campaigns over a span of one year from surface water, municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWWTPs), industrial wastewater treatment plants (IWWTPs), industrial enterprises, and aquaculture in a typical region in the Upper Taihu Basin. Overall concentration, temporal variation and spatial distribution of 16 PAHs in surface water and various pollution sources were evaluated and the potential pollution sources were identified. Results showed that concentrations of individual PAHs in the surface water ranged from less than the limit of quantification (LOQ) to 949 ng L-1, indicating a reduction of PAH contamination level after the implementation of environmental management actions. Influent of MWWTPs and wastewater from industrial enterprises exhibited relatively high Sigma PAHs concentrations (mean: 880 ng L-1 and 642 ng L-1, respectively); these samples also exhibited a similar seasonal variation as well as composition of PAH congeners to those found in surface water, and therefore were designated as the main emission sources of PAHs in the studied region. Additional source apportionment using principal component analysis was also conducted to verify the proposed sources and diagnose other pollution sources. The findings provided a thorough understanding of PAH pollution, especially its major emission sources, in a typical region with pollution-intensive industries after the implementation of strict environmental management.

J	Song, YY; Zhang, Q; Melack, JM; Li, YL				Song, Yanyan; Zhang, Qi; Melack, John M.; Li, Yunliang			Groundwater dynamics of a lake-floodplain system: Role of groundwater flux in lake water storage subject to seasonal inundation	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Groundwater behaviors in lake-floodplain systems are dynamic and complex; in particular, the role of groundwater flux in regulating lake water storage subject to strong seasonal variation is not well understood. This study addresses the contribution of groundwater flux in a large floodplain system (Poyang Lake, China), with focus on quantifying the groundwater-lake interactions at multiple time scales in high rainfall (2010) and low rainfall (2011) years using a groundwater flow model (MODFLOW). Simulated results revealed that the unconfined aquifer received approximately 8 % of the annual rainfall as groundwater recharge. Fluctuations in shallow groundwater and lake water level reflected hydraulic synchronization and hysteresis. Additionally, the diurnal variability in the groundwater-lake exchange fluxes was subject to dynamic and bidirectional patterns, and a time lag between the water exchange and rainfall was also found. For 2010 and 2011, the monthly net flux of lake infiltration into groundwater was 1.5-10.0 mm and 0.1-6.0 mm and groundwater exfiltration into lake was 1.3-9.5 mm and 0.4-2.2 mm, respectively, demonstrating a significant variation of the exchange magnitude and direction. In particular, we found that groundwater exfiltration contributed up to 55 % of lake storage change in February of 2011. The outcomes from this study indicate that groundwater can be a major component of the Poyang Lake's water balance, which suggests an important role of groundwater in regulating the lake water storage and perhaps other flood pulse systems.					deng, yan/KCK-8563-2024; ZHANG, Qi/MFJ-8647-2025	Li, Yunliang/0000-0002-0708-9138; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				JAN 20	2023	857		2						159414	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159414	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159414		OCT 2022						36244485					WOS:000906909000004
J	Giuliani, M; Crochemore, L; Pechlivanidis, I; Castelletti, A				Giuliani, Matteo; Crochemore, Louise; Pechlivanidis, Ilias; Castelletti, Andrea			From skill to value: isolating the influence of end user behavior on seasonal forecast assessment	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Recent improvements in initialization procedures and representation of large-scale hydrometeorological processes have contributed to advancing the accuracy of hydroclimatic forecasts, which are progressively more skillful over seasonal and longer timescales. These forecasts are potentially valuable for informing strategic multisector decisions, including irrigated agriculture, for which they can improve crop choices and irrigation scheduling. In this operational context, the accuracy associated with the forecast system setup does not necessarily yield proportional marginal benefit, as this is also affected by how forecasts are employed by end users. This paper aims at quantifying the value of hydroclimatic forecasts in terms of potential economic benefit to the end users, which allows for the inference of a relation between gains in forecast skill and gains in end user profit. We also explore the sensitivity of this benefit to both forecast system setup and end user behavioral factors. These analyses are supported by an evaluation framework demonstrated on the Lake Como system (Italy), a regulated lake operated for flood protection and irrigation supply. Our framework relies on an integrated modeling chain composed of three building blocks: bias-adjusted seasonal meteorological forecasts are used as input to the continentally calibrated E-HYPE hydrological model; predicted lake inflows are used for conditioning the daily lake operations; and the resulting lake releases feed an agricultural model to estimate the net profit of the farmers in a downstream irrigation district. Results suggest that despite the gain in average conditions being negligible, informing the operations of Lake Como based on seasonal hydrological forecasts during intense drought episodes allows about 15 % of the farmers' profit to be gained with respect to a baseline solution not informed by any forecast. Moreover, our analysis suggests that behavioral factors capturing different perceptions of risk and uncertainty significantly impact the quantification of the benefit to the end users, whereby the estimated forecast value is potentially undermined by different levels of end user risk aversion. Lastly, our results show an intricate skill-to-value relation modulated by the underlying hydrologic conditions, which is well aligned over an exponential function in dry years, while the gains in profit are almost insensitive to the improvements in forecast skill in wet years.					; Pechlivanidis, Ilias/AAC-6979-2019; Castelletti, Andrea/AAG-7111-2020	Giuliani, Matteo/0000-0002-4780-9347; Castelletti, Andrea/0000-0002-7923-1498; Crochemore, Louise/0000-0001-5776-6275; Pechlivanidis, Ilias/0000-0002-3416-317X													1027-5606	1607-7938				DEC 11	2020	24	12					5891	5902		10.5194/hess-24-5891-2020	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-5891-2020													WOS:000599525000002

A full characterization of C cycling requires detailed information on spatiotemporal patterns of surface-atmosphere fluxes. However, relevant C cycle observations are highly variable in their coverage and reporting standards. Especially problematic is the lack of integration of the carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange of the ocean, inland freshwaters and the land surface with the atmosphere. Here we adopt a data-driven approach to synthesize a wide range of observation-based spatially explicit surface-atmosphere CO2 fluxes from 2001 to 2010, to identify the state of today's observational opportunities and data limitations. The considered fluxes include net exchange of open oceans, continental shelves, estuaries, rivers, and lakes, as well as CO2 fluxes related to net ecosystem productivity, fire emissions, loss of tropical aboveground C, harvested wood and crops, as well as fossil fuel and cement emissions. Spatially explicit CO2 fluxes are obtained through geostatistical and/ or remote-sensing-based upscaling, thereby minimizing biophysical or biogeochemical assumptions encoded in process-based models. We estimate a bottom-up net C exchange (NCE) between the surface (land, ocean, and coastal areas) and the atmosphere. Though we provide also global estimates, the primary goal of this study is to identify key uncertainties and observational shortcomings that need to be prioritized in the expansion of in situ observatories. Uncertainties for NCE and its components are derived using resampling. In many regions, our NCE estimates agree well with independent estimates from other sources such as process-based models and atmospheric inversions. This holds for Europe (mean +/- 1 SD: 0.8 +/- 0.1 PgC yr(-1), positive numbers are sources to the atmosphere), Russia (0.1 +/- 0.4 PgC yr(-1)), East Asia (1.6 +/- 0.3 PgC yr(-1)), South Asia (0.3 +/- 0.1 PgC yr(-1)), Australia (0.2 +/- 0.3 PgC yr(-1)), and most of the Ocean regions. Our NCE estimates give a likely too large CO2 sink in tropical areas such as the Amazon, Congo, and Indonesia. Overall, and because of the overestimated CO2 uptake in tropical lands, our global bottom-up NCE amounts to a net sink of 5.4 +/- 2.0 PgC yr(-1). By contrast, the accurately measured mean atmospheric growth rate of CO2 over 2001-2010 indicates that the true value of NCE is a net CO2 source of 4.3 +/- 0.1 PgC yr(-1). This mismatch of nearly 10 PgC yr(-1) highlights observational gaps and limitations of data-driven models in tropical lands, but also in North America. Our uncertainty assessment provides the basis for setting priority regions where to increase carbon observations in the future. High on the priority list are tropical land regions, which suffer from a lack of in situ observations. Second, extensive pCO(2) data are missing in the Southern Ocean. Third, we lack observations that could enable seasonal estimates of shelf, estuary, and inland water-atmosphere C exchange. Our consistent derivation of data uncertainties could serve as prior knowledge in multicriteria optimization such as the Carbon Cycle Data Assimilation System (CCDAS) and atmospheric inversions, without over-or under-stating bottom-up data credibility. In the future, NCE estimates of carbon sinks could be aggregated at national scale to compare with the official national inventories of CO2 fluxes in the land use, land use change, and forestry sector, upon which future emission reductions are proposed.

Determining total emissions and environmental drivers of methane flux in a Lake Erie estuarine marsh	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Estuarine freshwater marshes can act as an important ecosystem for carbon storage and flux because of its strategic position in a watershed. We monitored CH4 and CO2 fluxes in Old Woman Creek, an estuarine wetland of Lake Erie, Ohio. The eddy covariance (EC) technique was used to measure fluxes of CH4 and CO2 continuously during the growing seasons of 2015 and 2016. Simultaneously, monthly sampling of gas exchange was conducted using non-steady state chambers in four distinct land-cover types in the wetland: open water, emergent vegetation (Typha spp.), floating vegetation (Nelumbo spp.) and mud flats. Chambers and EC measurements were combined to provide estimates of the continuous contributions of each land cover to the total methane emissions of the wetland. In addition, water and meteorological measurements were used to determine the most important environmental drivers of methane flux in the wetland. We found an average rate of emission from the Typha patch, the most abundant vegetated land cover, of 219.4 g CH4-C m(-2) y(-1), which was much higher than rates reported in similar emergent vegetation types in other wetlands. Mud flats had the highest rates of CH4 emission, followed by Nelumbo and Typha patches, and open water. Mud flats contributed 6.8% of the total CH4 emissions of the wetland despite occupying only 1.5% of the wetland area, whereas open water contributed 16.1% despite occupying 47% of the wetland area. Water temperature and wind speed were the strongest environmental drivers of CH4 flux to the atmosphere. Carbon fluxes were strongly correlated to methane fluxes. Fluctuating water levels above the wetland's surface had a weak effect on overall CH4 emissions in the wetland, with stronger effects during the night than during the day. Providing an empirical model that predicts the influence of different environmental drivers CH4 emissions in the wetland can aid in the design of estuarine wetlands that retain nutrients and reduce coastal eutrophication while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions.

A global view of stratospheric gravity wave hotspots located with Atmospheric Infrared Sounder observations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The main aim of this study is to find and classify hotspots of stratospheric gravity waves on a global scale. The analysis is based on a 9 year record (2003 to 2011) of radiance measurements by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) aboard NASA's Aqua satellite. We detect gravity waves based on 4.3 mu m brightness temperature variances. Our method focuses on peak events, i.e., strong gravity wave events for which the local variance considerably exceeds background levels. We estimate the occurrence frequencies of these peak events for different seasons and time of day and use the results to find local maxima or "hotspots." In addition, we use AIRS radiances at 8.1 mu m to simultaneously detect convective events, including deep convection in the tropics and mesoscale convective systems at middle latitudes. We classify the gravity wave sources based on seasonal occurrence frequencies for convection, but also by means of time series analyses and topographic data. Our study reproduces well-known hotspots of gravity waves, e. g., the Andes and the Antarctic Peninsula. However, the high horizontal resolution of the AIRS observations also allows us to locate numerous mesoscale hotspots, which are partly unknown or poorly studied so far. Most of these mesoscale hotspots are found near orographic features like mountain ranges, coasts, lakes, deserts, or isolated islands. This study will help to select promising regions and seasons for future case studies of gravity waves. Citation: Hoffmann, L., X. Xue, and M. J.

Turkey) by Means of Multi-Temporal InSAR Techniques and Sentinel-1 Data	REMOTE SENSING												Surface deformations were observed in Bolvadin, located in the province of Afyon (western Turkey) in the last decade which occurred without any destructive earthquakes. In this study, ground deformation of the Bolvadin region is analyzed by means of multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique with Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Sentinel-1 data acquired in ascending and descending orbits between October 2014 and October 2018 are processed with the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) and Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS) open source software tools. Deformation velocity maps and line-of-sight (LOS) displacement time series are produced and compared with geology, groundwater level and the water surface area of Eber Lake nearby. Deformation velocity maps reveal significant subsidence in most of the town and surrounding regions, which is confirmed by field observations that show severe damage to the settlements and infrastructure of the town. The most severe subsidence is observed to be in the southern part of Bolvadin with rates up to 35 mm/year, which is characterized by the presence of soft alluvial deposits. Composed of slope debris/talus and conglomerate, the northeastern part of the deforming region experiences a relatively lower rate of subsidence. A strong correlation between LOS displacement time series and groundwater level exists both in the short and long term. Moreover, short term variations in LOS displacement time series also show high similarity with seasonal variations in the water surface area of Eber Lake located a few km southeast of the town. We conclude that the primary cause of subsidence is most probably the overexploitation of groundwater and hydrological changes because of (1) the strong correlation of subsidence with lithological units, (2) the similarity between deformation rate and groundwater level changes, (3) the correspondence of seasonal variations in water surface area and short-term deformation rate oscillations, and (4) the absence of InSAR velocity contrast across the active faults.

J	Ji, NN; Wang, SR; Zhang, L				Ji, Ningning; Wang, Shengrui; Zhang, Li			Characteristics of dissolved organic phosphorus inputs to freshwater lakes: A case study of Lake Erhai, southwest China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In this study, we made the first estimate of the annual dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) load to Lake Erhai, a typical mesotrophic-eutrophic lake in China. We also evaluated what proportion of DOP was bioavailable using enzymatically hydrolyzable phosphorus (EHP), and further assessed the potential impacts of DOP on lake water quality. We estimated that the annual DOP load into Lake Erhai accounted for nearly 50% of total dissolved phosphorus, while EHP accounted for about 30% of the bioavailable phosphorus (BAP) pool. The DOP load increased and accounted for a greater proportion of total dissolved phosphorus and BAP loads during the wet season, and helped maintain algal blooms. Inflowing rivers were the main source of DOP with high bioavailability to Lake Erhai, especially in the wet season. The EHP concentrations of the inflowing rivers were positively correlated with algal biomass. The observation suggests that, as a significant source of BAP, the contribution of the DOP load to eutrophication of the lake should not be ignored, especially given the low soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations in the lake water during the algal biomass period. Information on the contributions from different pollution sources is needed to support the development of effective P pollution control strategies. Short-term strategies to protect Lake Erhai include better management of the inflowing rivers, especially in the northern part during the wet season, while, over the long-term, strategies to decrease P release from lake sediments should be considered.

Light-Dependent Aerobic Methane Oxidation Reduces Methane Emissions from Seasonally Stratified Lakes	PLOS ONE												Lakes are a natural source of methane to the atmosphere and contribute significantly to total emissions compared to the oceans. Controls on methane emissions from lake surfaces, particularly biotic processes within anoxic hypolimnia, are only partially understood. Here we investigated biological methane oxidation in the water column of the seasonally stratified Lake Rotsee. A zone of methane oxidation extending from the oxic/anoxic interface into anoxic waters was identified by chemical profiling of oxygen, methane and delta C-13 of methane. Incubation experiments with C-13-methane yielded highest oxidation rates within the oxycline, and comparable rates were measured in anoxic waters. Despite predominantly anoxic conditions within the zone of methane oxidation, known groups of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea were conspicuously absent. Instead, aerobic gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs were identified as the active methane oxidizers. In addition, continuous oxidation and maximum rates always occurred under light conditions. These findings, along with the detection of chlorophyll a, suggest that aerobic methane oxidation is tightly coupled to light-dependent photosynthetic oxygen production both at the oxycline and in the anoxic bottom layer. It is likely that this interaction between oxygenic phototrophs and aerobic methanotrophs represents a widespread mechanism by which methane is oxidized in lake water, thus diminishing its release into the atmosphere.

Our approach utilizes the stable isotopes of water (O-18, H-2) and the radioisotope radon (Rn-222) for determining long-term average and short-term snapshots in LGD. We conducted isotope balances for the 0.5-km(2) Lake Ammelshainer See (Germany) based on measurements of lake isotope inventories and groundwater composition accompanied by good quality and comprehensive long-term meteorological and isotopic data (precipitation) from nearby monitoring stations. The results from the steady-state annual isotope balances that rely on only two sampling campaigns are consistent for both O-18 and H-2 and suggested an overall long-term average LGD rate that was used to infer the water residence time of the lake. These findings were supported by the good agreement of the simulated LGD-driven annual cycles of O-18 and H-2 lake inventories with the observed lake isotope inventories. However, radon mass balances revealed lower values that might be the result of seasonal LGD variability. For obtaining further insights into possible seasonal variability of groundwater-lake interaction, stable water isotope and radon mass balances could be conducted more frequently (e.g., monthly) in order to use the derived groundwater discharge rates as input for time-variant isotope balances.					; Gibson, John/D-1897-2009; Petermann, Eric/AAW-5788-2021	Weiss, Holger/0000-0002-9736-9757; Gibson, John Joseph/0000-0001-5952-0228; Petermann, Eric/0000-0001-8039-5660													0885-6087	1099-1085				MAR 15	2018	32	6					805	816		10.1002/hyp.11456	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.11456													WOS:000427118400008

The extent to which the TGR impoundment has changed the surface areas of the two largest freshwater lakes in China, Lake Dongting and Lake Poyang, remains largely unknown. Here, we compared the surface areas of the two lakes pre and post the TGR impoundment as well as with a modelled non-TGR scenario. We found that the mean surface areas of Lake Dongting and Lake Poyang during the post-TGR period (2003-2016) were significantly smaller than in the pre-TGR period (1956-2002) and in the modelled non-TGR scenario (2003-2016). The impoundment of TGR has led to a shift from a sediment deposition regime to an erosion-dominated regime of the downstream-linked rivers and the two lakes. The impoundment of TGR further changed the seasonal variabilities in discharge and water level in the downstream-linked rivers and the two lakes, especially in the flood season. Our results suggest that TGR resulted in a 5.1%, 16.2%, and 12.2% decrease of the surface area of Lake Dongting in June 2003-September 2006, October 2006-September 2008, and October 2008-December 2016, respectively, and a corresponding decrease of 12.4%, 19.6%, and 15.8% for Lake Poyang. These changes cannot be attributed to variations in rainfall as no significant differences were found in the annual or monthly mean rainfall in the watersheds upstream of Luoshan and Jiujiang + Hukou between the pre-TGR and the post-TGR period. Our results call for the development of a strong holistic management plan for cascading reservoirs, including TGR, to minimize the damage of downstream lake ecosystems.

In this study, using fluorescence analysis, we investigated the seasonal dynamics of DOM characteristics in Changshou Lake, which is a typical inland lake in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) area. We also discuss the environmental implications of DOM for mercury (Hg) dynamics. Based on the origins of two end-members, the variations in DOM observed in this study in Changshou Lake suggest that hydrological processes (e.g., terrestrial inputs resulting from runoff and humic-like component residences) and biological activities (e.g., microbial and algae growth) are the two main principal components controlling the seasonal dynamics of DOM characteristics. Furthermore, the dynamics of dissolved Hg co-varied with variations in DOM properties, rather than with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. This indicates that the previously reported simple correlations between DOC and Hg were not comprehensive and may lead to misunderstanding the interactions between DOM and Hg. Therefore, we recommend that when using DOM-Hg correlations to evaluate the role of DOM in the environmental fate of Hg, especially in field investigations of the spatial and temporal distribution of Hg, the properties of DOM must be taken into account.

GF-6 WFV with a high spatial and temporal resolution provides a comprehensive record of the dynamic changes in water quality parameters in a lake. In this study, based on GF-6 WFV images and the field sampling data of Xingkai Lake from 2020 to 2021, the accuracy of three machine learning models (RF: random forest; SVR: support vector regression; and BPNN: back propagation neural network) was compared by considering 11 combinations of surface reflectance in different wavebands as input variables for machine learning. We mapped the spatiotemporal variations of Chl-a concentrations in Xingkai Lake from 20192021 and integrated machine learning algorithms to demonstrate that RF obtained a better degree of derived-fitting (Calibration: N = 82, RMSE = 0.82 mu g/L, MAE = 0.57 mu g/L, slope = 0.94, and R-2 = 0.98; Validation: N = 40, RMSE = 2.12 mu g/L, MAE = 1.58 mu g/L, slope = 0.91, R-2 = 0.89, and RPD = 2.98). The interannual variation from 2019 to 2021 showed that the Chl-a concentration in Xingkai Lake was low from June to July, while maximum values were observed from October to November, thus showing significant seasonal differences. Spatial distribution showed that Chl-a concentrations were higher in Xiao Xingkai Lake than in Da Xingkai Lake. Nutrient inputs (N, P) and other environmental factors such as high temperature could have an impact on the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of Chl-a, therefore, combining GF-6 WFV satellite images with RF could realize large-scale monitoring and be more effective. Our results showed that remote-sensing-based machine learning algorithms provided an effective method to monitor lake eutrophication as well as technical support and methodological reference for inland lake water quality parameter inversion.					xu, shiqi/KEH-9943-2024; Li, Sijia/GPT-2594-2022; Chen, Fangfang/P-2381-2016; Li, Yong/LWI-9400-2024	tao, zui/0000-0002-8369-4452; Wen, Zhidan/0000-0002-8801-5324; 														2072-4292				OCT	2022	14	20							5136	10.3390/rs14205136	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14205136													WOS:000873523600001

Sixty years of data, from 1960-2019, are used to track the changes to the flood pulse there. We find that minimum water levels over 2010-2019 increased by up to 1.55 m at Kratie and maximum water levels decreased by up to 0.79 m at Prek Kdam when compared to 1960-1991 levels, causing a reduction of the annual flood extent. Concurrently, the duration of the flooding season has decreased by about 26 d (Kampong Cham) and 40 d (Chaktomuk), with the season starting later and ending much earlier. Along the Tonle Sap River, the average annual reverse flow from the Mekong to the Tonle Sap Lake has decreased by 56.5 %, from 48.7 km(3) in 1962-1972 to 31.7 km(3) in 2010-2018. As a result, wet-season water levels at Tonle Sap Lake dropped by 1.05 m in 2010-2019 compared to 1996-2009, corresponding to a 20.6 % shrinkage of the lake area. We found that upstream contributors such as current hydropower dams cannot fully account for the observed decline in flood pulse. Instead, local anthropogenic causes such as irrigation and channel incision are important drivers. We estimate that water withdrawal in the Cambodian floodplains is occurring at a rate of (2.1 +/- 0.3) km(3) yr(-1). Sediment decline and ongoing sand-mining operations have also caused channel erosion. As the flood pulse is essential for the ecological habitats, fisheries and livelihoods of the region, its reduction will have major implications throughout the basin, from the Tonle Sap system to the Vietnamese Mekong Delta downstream.

Evaporation from a temperate closed-basin lake and its impact on present, past, and future water level	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Lakes provide enormous economic, recreational, and aesthetic benefits to citizens. These ecosystem services may be adversely impacted by climate change. In the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area of Minnesota, USA, many lakes have been at historic low levels and water augmentation strategies have been proposed to alleviate the problem. White Bear Lake (WBL) is a notable example. Its water level declined 1.5 m during 2003-2013 for reasons that are not fully understood. This study examined current, past, and future lake evaporation to better understand how climate will impact the water balance of lakes within this region. Evaporation from WBL was measured from July 2014 to February 2017 using two eddy covariance (EC) systems to provide better constraints on the water budget and to investigate the impact of evaporation on lake level. The estimated annual evaporation losses for years 2014 through 2016 were 559 +/- 22 mm, 779 +/- 81 mm, and 766 +/- 11 mm, respectively. The higher evaporation in 2015 and 2016 was caused by the combined effects of larger average daily evaporation and a longer ice-free season. The EC measurements were used to tune the Community Land Model 4 - Lake, Ice, Snow and Sediment Simulator (CLM4-LISSS) to estimate lake evaporation over the period 1979-2016. Retrospective analyses indicate that WBL evaporation increased during this time by about 3.8 mm year(-1), which was driven by increased wind speed and lake-surface vapor pressure gradient. Using a business-as-usual greenhouse gas emission scenario (RCP8.5), lake evaporation was modeled forward in time from 2017 to 2100. Annual evaporation is expected to increase by 1.4 mm year(-1) over this century, largely driven by lengthening ice-free periods. These changes in ice phenology and evaporation will have important implications for the regional water balance, and water management and water augmentation strategies that are being proposed for these Metropolitan lakes.

Influence of permafrost distribution on groundwater flow in the context of climate-driven permafrost thaw: Example from Yukon Flats Basin, Alaska, United States	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Understanding the role of permafrost in controlling groundwater flow paths and fluxes is central in studies aimed at assessing potential climate change impacts on vegetation, species habitat, biogeochemical cycling, and biodiversity. Recent field studies in interior Alaska show evidence of hydrologic changes hypothesized to result from permafrost degradation. This study assesses the hydrologic control exerted by permafrost, elucidates modes of regional groundwater flow for various spatial permafrost patterns, and evaluates potential hydrologic consequences of permafrost degradation. The Yukon Flats Basin (YFB), a large (118,340 km(2)) subbasin within the Yukon River Basin, provides the basis for this investigation. Model simulations that represent an assumed permafrost thaw sequence reveal the following trends with decreasing permafrost coverage: (1) increased groundwater discharge to rivers, consistent with historical trends in base flow observations in the Yukon River Basin, (2) potential for increased overall groundwater flux, (3) increased spatial extent of groundwater discharge in lowlands, and (4) decreased proportion of suprapermafrost (shallow) groundwater contribution to total base flow. These trends directly affect the chemical composition and residence time of riverine exports, the state of groundwater-influenced lakes and wetlands, seasonal river-ice thickness, and stream temperatures. Presently, the YFB is coarsely mapped as spanning the continuous-discontinuous permafrost transition that model analysis shows to be a critical threshold; thus, the YFB may be on the verge of major hydrologic change should the current permafrost extent decrease. This possibility underscores the need for improved characterization of permafrost and other hydrogeologic information in the region via geophysical techniques, remote sensing, and ground-based observations.

The study evaluated sediment quality according to threshold effect concentration (TEC) and probable effect concentration (PEC) values based on sediment quality guidelines (SQG), and provided a potential ecological risk assessment (PERI) along with indices such as geoaccumulation index (NIgeo), enrichment factor (EF), contamination factor (CF), and pollution load index (PLI). For this purpose, surface sediment from 10 different points and core samples from three different points were seasonally collected and the concentrations of nine heavy metals were determined by ICP-MS. The findings indicated the following accumulation order of heavy metals in the sediment: Fe > Al > Mn > Ni > Cr > Zn > Pb > Co > Cd, with concentrations of Al, Mn, and Ni being high in the surface sediment samples. According to the NIgeo, surface sediment and core samples were very slightly polluted with Cr, Mn, and Co at most stations, while five stations were slightly polluted with Cd. Regarding EF, the lake was at risk in terms of Al and Pb accumulation. The CF results indicated that the lake was under pressure in terms of heavy metal pollution. The PLI results indicated a significant pollution hazard at all stations, while the PERI analysis indicated moderate risk of heavy metal pollution at some stations. As one of the most comprehensive studies applying such indices to Lake Bafa, the results are very significant in terms of evaluating the lake's ecological sustainability.

Cyanobacteria dynamics in a small tropical reservoir: Understanding spatio-temporal variability and influence of environmental variables	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Anthropogenic disturbances within or near aquatic ecosystems often contribute to eutrophication events. Cyanobacteria are a key group responsible for environmental problems associated with eutrophication processes. Interest is growing in estimating the threat of cyanobacteria in tropical Africa, however, there is still a lack of understanding regarding temporal drivers of cyanobacteria dynamics in natural aquatic ecosystems given the paucity of relevant fundamental research in this area. To better understand cyanobacteria dynamics, potential drivers of cyanobacteria dynamics were investigated in a model tropical reservoir system, whereby phytoplankton communities and water quality parameters were sampled during the tropical hot-wet, cool-dry and hot-dry seasons. Fifteen cyanobacteria taxa were recorded over the study period. Microcystis spp. and Cylindrospermopsis spp., known cyanotoxins producers, were the most prevalent bloom-forming taxa found in the study, with overall Cyanobacteria relative abundances being greatest during the cool-dry season. This was likely driven by decreased river inflows and increased reservoir mixing during the cool-dry period. Combinations of macrophyte cover, dissolved oxygen levels, water transparency, reactive phosphorus, water depth and chemical oxygen demand were found to significantly affect cyanobacteria community structure. The study highlights that under climate change forecasts (for much of tropical arid Africa), potentially harmful and problematic algal species may proliferate. Management options, therefore, need to be explored to maintain water quality and potable availability to mitigate against indirect harmful effects of environmental changes on ecosystems and human communities that utilise their services.

This study presents a Landsat-8 based Shallow Water Bio-optical Properties (SBOP) algorithm to overcome bottom effects so as to successfully observe spatial and temporal CDOM dynamics in inland waters. We evaluated the algorithm via 58 images and a large set of field measurements collected across seasons of multiple years in the Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron. Results showed that the SBOP algorithm reduced estimation errors by as much as 4 times (RMSE = 0.17 and R-2 = 0.87 in the Saginaw Bay) when compared to the QAA-CDOM algorithm that did not take into account bottom reflectance. These improvements in CDOM estimation are consistent and robust across broad range CDOM absorption. Our analysis revealed: 1) the proposed remote sensing algorithm resulted in significant improvements in tracing spatial-temporal CDOM inputs from terrestrial environments to lakes, 2) CDOM distribution captured with high re-solution land-viewing satellite is useful in revealing the impacts of terrestrial ecosystems on the aquatic environment, and 3) Landsat-8 OLI, with its 16 days revisit time, provides valuable time series data for studying CDOM seasonal variations at land-water interface and has the potential to reveal its relationship to adjacent terrestrial biogeography and hydrology. The study presents a shallow water algorithm for studying freshwater or coastal ecology, as well as carbon cycling science.					; Li, Jiwei/S-9582-2019; Yu, Qian/A-6787-2010; Tian, Yong/A-6793-2010	Yu, Qian/0000-0001-6816-3082; Li, Jiwei/0000-0002-0275-4872; Tian, Yong/0000-0001-9268-3547													0034-4257	1879-0704				DEC 1	2018	218						189	200		10.1016/j.rse.2018.09.014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2018.09.014													WOS:000449449800014
J	Serur, AB; Adi, KA				Serur, Abdulkerim Bedewi; Adi, Kero Arigaw			Multi-site calibration of hydrological model and the response of water balance components to land use land cover change in a rift valley Lake Basin in Ethiopia	SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN												This study aims to perform multi-site calibration and validation of SWAT model using streamflow data, and investigating the responses of water balance components to land use land cover (LULC) change in the Gidabo river sub-basin of rift valley lake basin in southern part of Ethiopia. SUFI-2 algorithm embedded in the SWAT-CUP was employed for sensitivity analysis, calibration, and validation on a monthly basis. The 17 years (1990-2006) streamflow data for three (Aposto, Bedessa, and Measso) gauging stations were used for calibrating the model while 8 years (2007-2014) streamflow data was used for validating the model. The calibrated and validated SWAT model was then used to investigate the response of water balance components to LULC change for three periods (1990, 2005, and 2019) which were performed using ERDAS Imagine 2014 with a maximum likelihood classifier. The most common statistical model performance evaluation indices namely Coefficient of Determination (R-2 ), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), and Percent Bias (PBIAS) were used to evaluate performance of the SWAT model in simulating sub-basin hydrology; in addition to physical inspection of observed and simulated streamflow hydrograph. The findings of the multi-site model performance evaluation indicated that the values of R2 ranged from 0.80 to 0.64 and 0.74 to 0.72 during calibration and validation periods respectively. The values of NSE ranged from 0.74 to 0.61 and 0.71 to 0.65 during calibration and validation periods respectively whereas PBIAS ranged from 19.70 to-3.20 and 18.10 to 0.80 during calibration and validation periods respectively. The calibration and validation results indicated that the SWAT model would simulate fairly well the historical stream flow at three gauging stations. The mean annual streamflow response to LULC change for the periods 1990-2005 and 2005-2019 was observed to increase by 2.13% (1.16m(3)/s) and 3.62% (2.04m(3)/s), respectively and the mean seasonal streamflow was obtained to increase during wet season (April-September) while decreasing trend was observed during dry season (October-March) in all three gauged stations. Results also revealed that there were significant spatiotemporal variations of surface runoff, groundwater flow, lateral flow, and evapotranspiration in the sub-basin. The multi-site calibration and validation together with uncertainty analysis detects spatial variability and simulates the water balance components under changing LULC, which is paramount importance for planning and formulating appropriate integrated land and water resources management and development strategies in the rift valley lake basin of Gidabo river sub-basin in Ethiopia.

J	Vadde, KK; Feng, QL; Wang, JJ; McCarthy, AJ; Sekar, R				Vadde, Kiran Kumar; Feng, Qiaoli; Wang, Jianjun; McCarthy, Alan J.; Sekar, Raju			Next-generation sequencing reveals fecal contamination and potentially pathogenic bacteria in a major inflow river of Taihu Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Taihu Lake is one of the largest freshwater lakes in China and serves as an important source for drinking water. This lake is suffering from eutrophication, cyanobacterial blooms and fecal pollution, and the inflow Tiaoxi River is one of the main contributors. The goal here was to characterize the bacterial community structure of Tiaoxi River water by next-generation sequencing (NGS), paying attention to bacteria that are either fecal-associated or pathogenic, and to examine the relationship between environmental parameters and bacterial community structure. Water samples collected from 15 locations in three seasons, and fecal samples collected from different hosts and wastewater samples were used for bacterial community analysis. The phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Cyanobacteria were predominant in most of the water samples tested. In fecal samples, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were abundant, while wastewater samples were dominated by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, and Chloroflexi. The cluster analysis and principal coordinate analysis indicated that bacterial community structure was significantly different between water, fecal and sewage samples. Shared OTUs between water samples and chicken, pig, and human fecal samples ranged from 4.5 to 9.8% indicating the presence of avian, pig and human fecal contamination in Tiaoxi River. At genus level, five bacterial genera of fecal origin and sequences of seven potential pathogens were detected in many locations and their presence was correlated well with the land use pattern. The sequencing data revealed that Faecalibacterium could be a potential target for human-associated microbial source-tracking qPCR assays. Our results suggest that pH, conductivity, and temperature were the main environmental factors in shaping the bacterial community based on redundancy analysis. Overall, NGS is a valuable tool for preliminary investigation of environmental samples to identify the potential human health risk, providing specific information about fecal and potentially pathogenic bacteria that can be followed up by specific methods.

Water balance analysis for the Tonle Sap Lake-floodplain system	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The Tonle Sap Lake of Cambodia is the largest freshwater body of Southeast Asia, forming an important part of the Mekong River system. The lake has an extremely productive ecosystem and operates as a natural floodwater reservoir for the lower Mekong Basin, offering flood protection and assuring the dry season flow to the Mekong Delta. In light of the accelerating pace of water resources development within the Mekong Basin and the anticipation of potentially significant hydrological impacts, it is critical to understand the overall hydrologic regime of Tonle Sap Lake. We present here a detailed water balance model based on observed data of discharges from the lake's tributaries, discharge between Mekong and the lake through the Tonle Sap River, precipitation, and evaporation. The overland flow between the Mekong and lake was modelled with the EIA 3D hydrodynamic model. We found that majority (53.5%) of the water originates from the Mekong mainstream, but the lake's tributaries also play an important role contributing 34% of the annual flow, while 12.5% is derived from precipitation. The water level in the lake is mainly controlled by the water level in the Mekong mainstream. The Tonle Sap system is hence very vulnerable, from a water quantity point of view, to possible changes in the Mekong mainstream and thus, development activities in the whole Mekong basin. From a biogeochemical point of view, the possible changes in the lake's own catchment are equally important, together with the changes in the whole Mekong Basin. Based on our findings, we recommend of continuing the monitoring programmes in lake's tributaries and urgently starting of groundwater measurement campaign within the floodplain, and including the groundwater modelling to be part of the hydrodynamic models applied for the lake.

In shallow water environments where phytoplankton and submerged plants coexist, the C-N-P limitations on the primary production of these aquatic organisms, and the mechanisms by which they promote the formation of AOC are poorly understood. In this study, over the hydrological year September 2018 to August 2019, a large-scale field simulation experiment at the Shawan Karst Test Site (SW China) with various types of land use was systematically conducted to investigate the C-N-P limitations on the primary production of phytoplankton and submerged plants. The results indicate that (1) phytoplankton are co-limited by nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) but with the N more important, while submerged plants are limited by carbon (C); (2) Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta display a stronger competitive advantage than Cyanophyta in aqueous environments with high C but low N-P; (3) there is a seasonal difference in the contribution of phytoplankton and submerged plants to the formation of AOC, however, throughout the year, the contributions of phytoplankton (27%) and submerged plants biomass (28%) to AOC concentrations in the water were similar, combinedly accounting for approximately 17% of the formed AOC. It is concluded that natural restoration of vegetation, or injecting CO2 into water, which results in higher C but lower N-P loadings, may simultaneously help to mitigate eutrophication (with changes in biological structure and species) and increase C sequestration in surface waters.

Four seasonal samplings were conducted at 83 sites from April to December in 2018. The water quality was assessed using heavy metal evaluation index (HEI), while hazard index (HI) and carcinogenic risks indicated potential human risk, according to 12 metals (Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Mo, Cd, Sb, Ba, and Pb). Spatially, sites were effectively classified into Group I and II using cluster analysis. Generally, dissolved metals were low in rivers of LCB at whole basin scale. Total metals concentrations, as well as HEI and HI, were significantly higher in Group II compared with Group I. The mean total concentration was 496.38 mu g L-1, with the highest mean of Zn (233.39 mu g L-1), followed by Ba (170.66 mu g L-1). The pollution status was generally classified as "slightly affected" by HEI, with a mean of 1.51. According to HI, there were 6.02% and 10.84% of all the 83 sites (main in Nanfei River) with greater chances of harmful health risks for adults and children, respectively. Furthermore, a high risk was observed of Cr, As, and Ni, which was listed in the decreasing order. Although the dissolved metals were relatively low, the potential risk for human health still existed in rivers of LCB, which the local manager should pay more attention to in future.

J	Zhang, SJ; Zhang, G; Wang, DJ; Liu, Q; Xu, M				Zhang, Shijie; Zhang, Gang; Wang, Dejian; Liu, Qin; Xu, Min			Investigation into runoff nitrogen loss variations due to different crop residue retention modes and nitrogen fertilizer rates in rice-wheat cropping systems	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Crop residue retention has been established as an effective conservation tillage practice for decreasing nitrogen (N) runoff losses and increasing crop production. However, the impacts on N runoff losses from annual rice wheat rotation are not well understood, which has prevented identification of optimal straw retention practice. Herein, N dynamics and losses in the runoff, crop yields, and soil properties were assessed for two years in a rice-wheat system after implementing straw return for five consecutive years. The field experiment included six treatments-N1, WN1, RN1: recommended N application with no straw, wheat straw, and rice straw return, respectively; and SN0, SN1, and SN2: both wheat and rice straw return with zero, recommended, and custom N addition, respectively. The results showed that NH4+-N and NO3--N were the major forms of N loads discharged during the rice and wheat season, respectively. The total N loss (TN, P < 0.001) and mean annual crop yield (rice and wheat, P < 0.01) significantly increased as the N fertilizer rate increased. With respect to crop residue retention modes, the cumulative TN loss and mean annual crop yield trends were: N1 > RN1 >WN1 > SN1 (P < 0.05) and SN1 >= RN1 WN1 approximate to N1 (P < 0.05), respectively. During a one-year rice-wheat rotation cycle, the treatments with simultaneous incorporation of crop residue and N fertilizer reduced N runoff loss by 2.7-20.9% (P < 0.05) and increased crop yield by 8.7-16.9% (P < 0.05), of which the SN1 treatment was found to be the most effective. The straw-induced reducing effect occurred only during the base and tiller fertilization stages of the rice growing period, which was primarily regulated by soil inorganic nitrogen (SIN), soil organic carbon (SOC), and pH during the rice tiller stage. Our findings indicate that straw return decreases N runoff loss by mediating factors in soil and standing water. In order to reduce N runoff loss without jeopardizing crop yield, the practice of double seasons straw retention with recommended N application (SN1) is suggested in the rice-wheat rotation cropping system in southern China.

J	Yao, L; Chen, CR; Liu, GH; Liu, WZ				Yao, Lu; Chen, Chengrong; Liu, Guihua; Liu, Wenzhi			Sediment nitrogen cycling rates and microbial abundance along a submerged vegetation gradient in a eutrophic lake	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Decline of submerged vegetation is one of the most serious ecological problems in eutrophic lakes worldwide. Although restoration of submerged vegetation is widely assumed to enhance ecological functions (e.g., nitrogen removal) and aquatic biodiversity, the evidence for this assumption is very limited. Here, we investigated the spatio-temporal patterns of sediment potential nitrification, unamended denitrification and N(2)Oproduction rates along a vegetation gradient in the Lake Honghu, where submerged vegetation was largely restored by prohibiting net-pen aquaculture. We also used five functional genes as markers to quantify the abundance of sediment nitrifying and denitrifying microorganisms. Results showed that unvegetated sediments supported greater nitrification rates than rhizosphere sediments of perennial or seasonal vegetation. However, the absence of submerged vegetation had no significant effect on denitrification and N2O production rates. Additionally, the abundance of functional microorganisms in sediments was not significantly different among vegetation types. Season had a strong effect on both nitrogen cycling processes and microbial abundances. The highest nitrification rates were observed in September, while the highest denitrification rates occurred in December. The temporal variation of sediment nitrification, denitrification and N2O production rates could be due to changes in water quality and sediment properties rather than submerged vegetation and microbial abundances. Our findings highlight that vegetation restoration in eutrophic lakes improves water quality but does not enhance sediment nitrogen removal rates and microbial abundances. Therefore, for reducing the N level in eutrophic lakes, major efforts should be made to control nutrients export from terrestrial ecosystems. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We present and analyze an observational dataset of fire for the Yunnan Plateau in southwestern China for the past 20 years, together with a Holocene fire history documented by four sedimentary black carbon records from four lakes on the Yunnan Plateau: lakes Dian, Xingyun, Qilu, and Yilong. Our aims were to explore the linkage between wildfires and natural and anthropogenic variables driving wildfire occurrence on multiple timescales. The results show that on a short timescale, more wildfires occurred in drier seasons, and on a longer timescale, more wildfires occurred during 6 e2.8 cal kyr BP, when humidity decreased. In contrast, there was a moderate wildfire incidence during the relatively humid interval from 11.7 to 6 cal kyr BP. These observations indicate that fire activity is controlled by the humidity, against the background of the abundance of biofuel. The lowest degree of biomass burning occurred after-2.8 cal kyr BP and was linked to an anthropogenic reduction of biomass availability, despite an increase in drought. This suggests the importance of active fire management and prescribed clearance measures, especially given projections of continued drought and increased vege-tation cover. (c) 2022 The Authors.

Eutrophication Drives Extreme Seasonal CO2Flux in Lake Ecosystems	ECOSYSTEMS												Lakes process a disproportionately large fraction of carbon relative to their size and spatial extent, representing an important component of the global carbon cycle. Alterations of ecosystem function via eutrophication change the balance of greenhouse gas flux in these systems. Without eutrophication, lakes are net sources of CO(2)to the atmosphere, but in eutrophic lakes this function may be amplified or reversed due to cycling of abundant autochthonous carbon. Using a combination of high-frequency and discrete sensor measurements, we calculated continuous CO(2)flux during the ice-free season in 15 eutrophic lakes. We found net CO(2)influx over our sampling period in 5 lakes (- 47 to - 1865 mmol m(-2)) and net efflux in 10 lakes (328 to 11,755 mmol m(-2)). Across sites, predictive models indicated that the highest efflux rates were driven by nitrogen enrichment, and influx was best predicted by chlorophyllaconcentration. Regardless of whether CO(2)flux was positive or negative, stable isotope analyses indicated that the dissolved inorganic carbon pool was not derived from heterotrophic degradation of terrestrial organic carbon, but from degradation of autochthonous organic carbon, mineral dissolution, and atmospheric uptake. Optical characterization of dissolved organic matter revealed an autochthonous organic matter pool. CO(2)influx was correlated with autochthony, while efflux was correlated with total nitrogen and watershed wetland cover. Our findings suggest that CO(2)uptake by primary producers during blooms can contribute to continuous CO(2)influx for days to months. Conversely, eutrophic lakes in our study that were net sources of CO(2)to the atmosphere showed among the highest rates reported in the literature. These findings suggest that anthropogenic eutrophication has substantially altered biogeochemical processing of carbon on Earth.					; Morales, Ana/AAA-1654-2020	Wanamaker, Alan/0000-0002-6560-6420; 													1432-9840	1435-0629				MAR	2021	24	2					434	450		10.1007/s10021-020-00527-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-020-00527-2		JUL 2020											WOS:000553741500001

The onset and mechanisms of subsidence in the rift system, the interconnectivity of these lakes, and their response to the transition into the Oligocene icehouse are poorly understood. This study aims to clarify these points by examining the stratigraphy and depositional environments in the Apt Basin. We correlate and date Eocene to lowermost Oligocene geological units using a basin-wide facies model combined with sedimentological and geochronological approaches. We show the existence of three lacustrine phases, each separated by complete lake drying events: (1) an Ypresian (?) - Lutetian lake-marsh system dominated by palustrine carbonates; (2) a Bartonian (?) - Priabonian siliciclastic fluvio-deltaic and saline lake system; and (3) a lower Rupelian saline carbonate lake system. The presence of a lake system during the Ypresian (?) - Lutetian suggests an onset of basin subsidence before most other basins of the rift system in southeastern France, and is associated with the late Pyrenean deformation phase. The initiation of the second lacustrine phase marks the beginning of E-W extension and the formation of the Apt Basin as an individual horst & graben system. Based on facies distribution, we demonstrate the hydrological isolation of the Apt Basin from other basins and the improbability of any marine connection during the first two phases. This isolation is less certain for the third phase. We show a close synchronicity between the second lake drying event and the Eocene-Oligocene Transition. The third lacustrine phase, dominated by carbonate production and low siliciclastic input, is interpreted as reflecting a long-term decrease in surface runoff associated with the fall into the Oligocene icehouse.

This work gathered and summarized the published information about SPM in the Yangtze River system, including source, distribution, and environmental effects. Results indicated that the SPM concentration was high in the flood period and low in the dry period. Compared to midstream and downstream, the SPM concentration was the lowest in the upstream of the Yangtze River system. Furthermore, the level of SPM concentration was influenced by human activities, such as shipping, dredging, construction of water conservancy projects, and industrial/agricultural emissions, as well as natural conditions, such as wind, rainfall, and phytoplankton. Moreover, SPM would impact the element cycle in the water environment, including N, P, heavy metal, and persistent organic pollutants. In addition, SPM adsorbed these elemental ions or particles in water on its surface. Still, this adsorption was usually unstable, and when the properties of SPM itself or external environmental conditions changed, these elements would be released into the surrounding water body. With the flow of SPM in the water, these elements migrated upstream and downstream with the river. Thus, this work reveals the current status of SPM in the Yangtze River system, which provides an essential reference for further research on SPM in the water system.					yang, jiaxin/KPY-7577-2024															2073-4441				OCT	2023	15	19							3429	10.3390/w15193429	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15193429													WOS:001082975600001

Sequences affiliated with Gemmatimonadota were also reported from diverse aquatic habitats; however, it remains unknown whether they are native organisms or represent bacteria passively transported from sediment or soil. To address this question, we analyzed metagenomes constructed from five freshwater lakes in central Europe. Based on the 16S rRNA gene frequency, Gemmatimonadota represented from 0.02 to 0.6% of all bacteria in the epilimnion and between 0.1 and 1% in the hypolimnion. These proportions were independently confirmed using catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH). Some cells in the epilimnion were attached to diatoms (Fragilaria sp.) or cyanobacteria (Microcystis sp.), which suggests a close association with phytoplankton. In addition, we reconstructed 45 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) related to Gemmatimonadota. They represent several novel lineages, which persist in the studied lakes during the seasons. Three lineages contained photosynthesis gene clusters. One of these lineages was related to Gemmatimonas phototrophica and represented the majority of Gemmatimonadota retrieved from the lakes' epilimnion. The other two lineages came from hypolimnion and probably represented novel photoheterotrophic genera. None of these phototrophic MAGs contained genes for carbon fixation. Since most of the identified MAGs were present during the whole year and cells associated with phytoplankton were observed, we conclude that they represent truly limnic Gemmatimonadota distinct from the previously described species isolated from soils or sediments. IMPORTANCE Photoheterotrophic bacterial phyla such as Gemmatimonadota are key components of many natural environments. Its first photoheterotrophic cultured member, Gemmatimonas phototrophica, was isolated in 2014 from a shallow lake in the Gobi Desert. It contains a unique type of photosynthetic complex encoded by a set of genes which were likely received via horizontal transfer from Proteobacteria. We were intrigued to discover how widespread this group is in the natural environment. In the presented study, we analyzed 45 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that were obtained from five freshwater lakes in Switzerland and Czechia. Interestingly, it was found that phototrophic Gemmatimonadota are relatively common in euphotic zones of the studied lakes, whereas heterotrophic Gemmatimonadota prevail in deeper waters. Moreover, our analysis of the MAGs documented that these freshwater species contain almost the same set of photosynthesis genes identified before in Gemmatimonas phototrophica originating from the Gobi Desert.

A case study of the unregulated shallow aquifer in Cotonou	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												In Cotonou, as in many expanding West African cities, major population growth and infrastructural development has not kept up with informal settlement development onto floodable plains and marshes. The population of the slum, which makes up about 60% of the city's inhabitants, is highly disadvantaged and vulnerable to rising sea levels, flooding, sanitation and waste management issues. However, the risks associated with the use of contaminated shallow groundwater for domestic purposes are less recognised. Our study demonstrates that, in many instances, the cheaper option of the use of shallow groundwater from the coastal Quaternary aquifer for domestic purposes represents a significant risk for the poorer residents of Cotonou through the voluntary (drinking) or non-volontary (dish washing, cooking) consumption of this unmonitored and untreated water resource. In the 3 neighbourhoods surveyed, environmental tracers (major ions, Cl/Br molar ratios and stables isotopes) showed that this shallow aquifer is degraded by seawater intrusion as well as septic and sewerage contamination. In particular, the higher NOx concentrations correspond to ranges associated with sewerage and septic tank effluent pollution and the major ion concentrations and delta H-2-delta O-18 signatures showed that high salinity values are where groundwater mixes with saline Lake Nokoue water. The population using this resource from local wells should be made aware of seasonal changes in groundwater contamination and potential health risks associated with sewerage and septic tank contamination.					; Ruy, Stephane/L-1410-2013; Chaigneau, Alexis/E-4324-2010; Tweed, Sarah/ABA-2301-2021	Tweed, Sarah/0000-0002-0476-9023; GAUTHIER, Philippe/0000-0001-8363-6845; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				MAR	2020	582								124438	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124438	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124438													WOS:000517663700032
J	Jin, SD; Liu, SB; Li, Z; Chen, AQ; Ma, C				Jin, Siding; Liu, Sibing; Li, Zheng; Chen, Anqing; Ma, Chao			Astrochronology of a middle Eocene lacustrine sequence and sedimentary noise modeling of lake-level changes in Dongying Depression, Bohai Bay Basin	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												It has been demonstrated that the sedimentary deposits of Eocene succession in Bohai Bay Basin in China responded to astronomically forced climate changes. Several sections have been evaluated for cyclostratigraphy and many astronomical time scales (ATSs) have been constructed in Paleogene Bohai Bay Basin. However, the calibrations of age model and the constructed ATSs failed to reach an agreement and many of them relied on totally different orbital interpretations within the same section/borehole. In this work, we generated a new ATS for the middle Eocene lacustrine strata of middle to lower Member 3 (Es3m-l) and upper Member 4 (Es4u) of Shahejie Formation in Bohai Bay Basin. In this research, high resolution natural gamma-ray (GR) data were used for the cyclostratigraphy analysis of Es3m-l and Es4u Members of Well Fanye-1. We filtered -11.11 m cycles of t Es3m-l and -9.26 m cycles of Es4u which were directly correlated to the short eccentricity cycles (-100-kyr) of La2004 solution. The geomagnetic polarity ages of C18r/C19n, C19n/C19r and C19r/C20n in Geological Time Scale 2020 were adopted as age markers for the tuning in this study. This astrochronology provided astronomical time scale (ATS) in the range of 39.268 +/- 0.050 Ma to 43.621 +/- 0.050 Ma in Es3m-l and Es4u Member. The astrochronology of Well Fanye-1 of the same interval had been studied before. However, the ATS built in this paper used correlation coefficient (COCO) analysis and average spectral misfit (ASM) approach to provide quantitative measurement for fitting the observed sedimentary cycles to astronomical periods and given a range of plausible sedimentation rate. In this research, a sedimentary noise model was applied for the detection of highresolution lake-level variations controlled by orbital forcing. The lake-level variations generated from the sedimentary noise model were supported by previous sequence stratigraphic interpretations. Variable sedimentation could be affected by lake-level changes which have been demonstrated by the evolutionary correlation coefficient analysis of GR series. In addition, from the ATS and thin section observations, it was concluded that carbonate-clay laminae in lacustrine shale were generated annually. Seasonal carbonate-clay laminated shale formations are controlled by orbital scale variability of monsoon and are always developed in a relatively high eccentricity amplitude under deep water environment conditions. Finally, the lake-level rise at -40.500 Ma to -40.050 Ma was demonstrated to be the response to Middle Eocene Climate Optimal (MECO) event in lacustrine records.

We estimated daily rates of respiration and gross primary production (GPP) for up to a full year in each lake, via maximum likelihood fits of a free-water metabolism model to continuous high-frequency measurements of dissolved oxygen concentrations. Uncertainties were determined by a bootstrap analysis, allowing lake-days with poorly constrained rate estimates to be down-weighted in subsequent analyses. GPP and respiration varied considerably among lakes and at seasonal and daily timescales. Mean annual GPP and respiration ranged from 0.1 to 5.0 mg O-2 L-1 d(-1) and were positively related to total phosphorus but not dissolved organic carbon concentration. Within lakes, significant day-to-day differences in respiration were common despite large uncertainties in estimated rates on some lake-days. Daily variation in GPP explained 5% to 85% of the daily variation in respiration after temperature correction. Respiration was tightly coupled to GPP at a daily scale in oligotrophic and dystrophic lakes, and more weakly coupled in mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes. Background respiration ranged from 0.017 to 2.1 mg O-2 L-1 d(-1) and was positively related to indicators of recalcitrant allochthonous and autochthonous organic matter loads, but was not clearly related to an indicator of the quality of allochthonous organic matter inputs.

The role of microbial extracellular polymeric substances on formation of sulfate minerals and fibrous Mg-clays	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												A variety of Mg-, Na- and Ca-sulfates, including gypsum, and Mg-clays precipitate within the microbial mats that developed seasonally in the hypersaline playa lake El Longar (Central Spain). A multidisciplinary study of the microbial mats along a transect of the lake demonstrates that the degree of lithification of the mats increases from the soft and poorly lithified layers lying on the submerged ground to the highly crystalline mats present in the desiccated fringes. The community composition of the mats is diverse, dominated in terms of OTUs by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Cyanobacteria. The Proteobacteria include sulfur-cycling microbes, supporting biogeochemical cycling of this element. Cyanobacteria are the dominant EPS producers in microbial mats and Firmicutes and Proteobacteria have both been shown to play a role in EPS turnover. Several ions (e.g., Mg, 5, Si, Al, Fe, Ca, Na) are bound to functional groups of EPS. The abundance of sulfate groups and carboxylic acids suggested that the EPS have a strong binding capacity for Mg2+ and Ca2+, which were higher in the submerged microbial mats. Na, Mg, K, Ca, SO42- and Si are more concentrated in the EPS matrices than in the natural brines. The concentration of ions in the EPS is sufficient to precipitate a mixture of minerals through freeze-drying, that is similar to that found in intact mats. In the EPS of the submerged mats precipitate more types of minerals, including sulfates and Mg-clays, than in the EPS of the exposed areas. These results suggest that the mineral nucleation occurred during the degradation of the mats when the EPS was progressively desiccated and likely released high amounts of ions. The present study helps to understand intrasedimentary growth of sulfates and clays in microbial mats. The presence of these mineral assemblage can be related to a potential biosignature of microbial past life on Earth and possibly also on exoplanets, like Mars.

For more effective management of such a resource, more precise predictors of N level in groundwater using smart monitoring networks are needed. However, external factors such as land use type, rainfall, and N loads from multiple sources (residential and agricultural) make it difficult to accurately predict the spatial and temporal variations of N concentration. In order to identify the key factors affecting spatial and temporal N concentration in shallow groundwater and develop a predictive model, 635 groundwater samples from drinking wells in residential areas and agricultural wells in croplands of a typical agricultural watershed in the Erhai Lake Basin, southwest China, in the period from 2018 to 2020, were collected and analyzed. The results showed that the type of land use and seasonal variations significantly affected the N forms and their concentrations in the shallow groundwater, as the ratios of ON and NO3--N to TN were 30%-39% and 52%-59% for the two land uses and 25%-44% and 46%-66% for seasonal changes. Their variations were reflected by electrical conductivity (EC) and redox environment. EC and dissolved oxygen (DO) had a positive non-linear relationship with the concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) and nitrate (NO3--N). The fitted non-linear quantitative models were established separately to predict TN and NO3--N concentrations in groundwater using easily available indictors (EC and DO). The high accuracy and performance of the models were investigated and approved by rRMSE, MAE, and 1:1 line. These findings can provide technical support for the rapid prediction and evaluation of N pollution in shallow groundwater through easily available indicators. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Physicochemical conditions and properties of particles in urban runoff and rivers: Implications for runoff pollution	CHEMOSPHERE												In this study, to gain an improved understanding of the fate and fractionation of particle-bound pollutants, we evaluated the physicochemical conditions and the properties of particles in rainwater, urban runoff, and rivers of Mixing, a city with a large drainage density in the Taihu Lake Basin, China. Road runoff and river samples were collected during the wet and dry seasons in 2015 and 2016. There were significant differences between the physicochemical conditions (pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), and electroconductivity (EC)) of rainwater, runoff, and rivers. The lowest pH and highest ORP values of rainwater provide the optimal conditions for leaching of particle-bound pollutants such as heavy metals. The differences in the physicochemical conditions of the runoff and rivers may contribute to the redistribution of pollutants between particulate and dissolved phases after runoff is discharged into waterways. Runoff and river particles were mainly composed of silt and clay (<63 mu m, 88.3%-90.7%), and runoff particles contained a higher proportion of nano-scale particles (<1 mu m) but a lower proportion of submicron-scale particles (1-16 mu m) than rivers. The ratio of turbidity to TSS increased with the proportion of fine particles and was associated with the accumulation of pollutants and settling ability of particles, which shows that it can be used as an index when monitoring runoff pollution.

However, the sustainable operation and successful application of these systems remain a challenge. This study aimed to assess the seasonal variations of performance, identify operational factors of nutrients removal and fill the knowledge gap of field-scale storing multipond constructed wetlands application in a plateau lake watershed. Preferable performances for pollutant purification and operation parameters were achieved in different water seasons. Highly related to the performance of wastewater treatment, operational parameters including temperature, mass loading rate, hydraulic loading rate, hydraulic retention time and water depth were analyzed through first-order kinetics model, Spearman's rank correlation and redundancy analysis. Optimized parameters obtained through different analyzing methods revealed that appropriate hydraulic loading rate and mass loading rate would give better purification performances in wet season.					; Li, Dan/JZD-2398-2024	Dan, Li/0000-0002-3665-5354; Huang, Minsheng/0000-0002-0598-9167													0960-8524	1873-2976				MAY	2019	280						295	302		10.1016/j.biortech.2019.01.116	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.01.116								30776656					WOS:000460896800035

Evidence from N-W Ethiopia	GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												We present an evidence-based approach to identify how best to support development of groundwater for small-scale irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We argue that it is important to focus this effort on shallow groundwater resources. We demonstrate and test this proposal at a case study site: Dangila woreda in the northwestern highlands of Ethiopia. This site was selected to allow exploration of a shallow weathered volcanic regolith type aquifer formation which is found to the South of Lake Tana and also exists more extensively across Ethiopia. We believe lessons from this case study are transferable and there is a case for arguing that shallow groundwater represents a neglected opportunity for promoting sustainable small-scale irrigated agriculture in SSA. In comparison with other global regions, the groundwater resources of SSA are among the least understood; borehole records and hydrogeological studies are lacking. Assessments of groundwater resources do exist, but they rely on remotely sensed data combined with modelling at national or regional scale, and they focus on deeper aquifers. There is a need for these broad evaluations to be supplemented by localised and detailed assessments. The case study here presents such an assessment in order to support analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats associated with developing small-scale irrigation utilising shallow groundwater. A multimethod groundwater recharge assessment was conducted utilising formal and community-based monitoring, field investigation and existing published data. Water table recovery tests at existing hand dug wells confirm that well yields of 1 l/s are achievable at the end of the wet season when water would be available to support an additional irrigated crop. Hydraulic conductivity estimates ranged from 0.2 to 6.4 m/d in the dry season and from 2.8 to 22.3 m/day in the wet season. Specific yield estimations have a wider range though the mean value of 0.09 is as would be expected. Records of groundwater levels and rainfall monitored by the local community for the period April 2014 to April 2018 show that all the wells maintained useable water levels beyond the end of the rainy season. An assessment of the hydrology of the Kilti catchment provided insights into groundwater availability within the wider area. The catchment receives about 1600 mm/year of rainfall, of which about 350 mm/year enters the groundwater as recharge, discharging to the river as baseflow with a similar amount of rapid runoff contributing to a total river flow of about 400 mm/year. The lowest value of baseflow is 82% of the mean baseflow, which suggests a degree of buffering and indicates that groundwater is available even in a very dry year. We conclude that arguments previously put forward against the promotion of shallow groundwater use for agriculture in SSA appear exaggerated. Our analysis challenges the view that shallow aquifers are unproductive and that irrigation will have unacceptable impacts on wetlands and other groundwater-dependent ecosystems. We believe lessons from this case study are transferable, and there is a case for arguing that shallow groundwater represents a neglected opportunity for promoting sustainable small-scale irrigated agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa. It appears that factors other than the physical availability of groundwater control the 'triggering' of development. Interventions to promote development of groundwater resources should recognise the importance of shallow aquifers.

J	Dorioz, JM; Pelletier, JP; Benoit, P				Dorioz, JM; Pelletier, JP; Benoit, P			Physico-chemical properties and bioavailability of particulate phosphorus of various origin in a watershed of Lake Geneva (France)	WATER RESEARCH												The bioavailability of the external loading of phosphorus to lakes is an important management concern (Williams et al., 1980; Bostrom et al., 1988). This paper examines some physical and chemical properties and the bioavailability of phosphorus associated with the particulate fraction of samples of sediments collected at various locations within a small 33 km(2) watershed that is drained by the Redon River into Lake Geneva (Fig. 1). The watershed is urbanized near its exit and the upland areas include cultivated lands, forested areas and marshes (Pilleboue and Dorioz, 1986). Soluble phosphorus enters the river from sewage discharges at downstream locations and particulate phosphorus runs off into the upstream drainage net from cultivated and forested lands. A total of 13 samples were collected once at various locations in the watershed during the winter following a three weeks period of low flow. Three of these samples were taken from river bottom sediment in the downstream reaches (samples 1, 2, 3, Table 1), three were taken from ditches draining forested areas (samples 9, 10, 11; Table 1), three were taken from small ditches draining intensively cropped areas (samples 6, 7, 8; Table 1), one sample was taken from the inlet and one from the outlet of a wetland receiving agricultural runoff(samples 5, 4; Table 1) and two samples were taken from the parent watershed soils (samples 12, 13; Table 1). The physical and chemical properties of the phosphorus associated with the sediment particles were evaluated using a variety of chemical extraction techniques (Hieltjes and Lijklema, 1980; Fares et al., 1974; Olsen et al., 1954). A bioassay method (Fig. 2) was used to evaluate phosphorus bioavailability. An isotopic tracer ((PO43-)-P-32) technique was used to determine the capability of the sediment particles to fix and exchange phosphorus with water (Fardeau, 1981; Tran et al., 1988). In this analysis, the fraction of the tracer remaining in solution after 1 min (rl/R) is an index of phosphorus fixation capacity of the sediment (low values of the ratio indicate high fixation capacities) while the amount of isotopically exchangeable phosphorus (mg P.kg(-1) exchanged with the water in 1 min) gives an estimate of immediately available phosphorus (E1). One study compared the bioavailability of the sediment phosphorus and the fixation capacity of sediment samples taken at various locations in the drainage network. The particulate phosphorus in the sediment samples taken from the downstream river bottom (1, 2, 3) showed a high bioavailability (Table 2 and Fig. 3). These sediments had a high ability to release phosphorus and a very low phosphorus fixation capacity in comparison to sediment samples taken from ditches draining both the forested or agricultural areas (4, 5, 6, 9). The total phosphorus content of the sediment samples did not appear to be a good indicator of the change in physico-chemical properties of the sediment or in phosphorus bioavailability (Table 3). Another study (Table 2) compared the physico-chemical properties and the bioavailability of particulate phosphorus among (1) the eroded sediments (samples 5, 6, 7, 8) collected from ditches draining agricultural areas; (2) the uneroded soils (samples 12, 13) of the area, and (3) the sediment at the inlet and outlet of the wetland area (Table 4). The sediments taken from the drainage ditches had substantially lower phosphorus bioavailability levels and increased phosphorus fixation capacities when compared to the parent soil of the area. The sediment sample collected at the outlet of the wetland showed the highest fixation capacity of all the samples collected during this research (Table 4, sample 4). The bioassay method used to determine phosphorus bioavailability was found to be very sensitive to the level of dilution of the sediment during the test. For example, In tests on a single sediment where concentrations were set at 30 and 300 mg.l(-1), the percentage of total phosphorus extracted from the samples was 45% and 4.2%, respectively (Table 5). The results of the studies described in this paper suggest that the physico-chemical properties and bioavailability of phosphorus associated with sediments vary not only with origin of the sediment, but also with the chemical-physical-biological phenomena that occur during transport through the watershed system. Figure 4 summarizes how these changes may occur as sediment moves through the watershed. Erosion of natural forested areas produces sediments with a high fixation capacity and a low content in total-P and bioavailable phosphorus. The properties of these sediments are strongly modified in the drainage net during low flow periods by interaction with sources of soluble phosphorus (Cahill, 1977; Golterman et al., 1983). The particulate phosphorus from erosion of agricultural areas (although somewhat lower in fixation capacity) may be modified in the drainage net in the same manner as the sediments from natural areas. During high flow events, sediments with high phosphorus levels may be diluted and release soluble phosphorus (Dorioz et al., 1989). (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recent understanding of Antarctic supraglacial lakes using satellite remote sensing	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT												Supraglacial lakes (SGLs) are now known to be widespread in Antarctica, where they represent an important component of ice sheet mass balance. This paper reviews how recent progress in satellite remote sensing has substantially advanced our understanding of SGLs in Antarctica, including their characteristics, geographic distribution and impacts on ice sheet dynamics. Important advances include: (a) the capability to resolve lakes at sub-metre resolution at weekly timescales; (b) the measurement of lake depth and volume changes at seasonal timescales, including sporadic observations of lake drainage events and (c) the integration of multiple optical satellite datasets to obtain continent-wide observations of lake distributions. Despite recent progress, however, there remain important gaps in our understanding, most notably: (a) the relationship between seasonal variability in SGL development and near-surface climate; (b) the prevalence and impact of SGL drainage events on both grounded and floating ice and (c) the sensitivity of individual ice shelves to lake-induced hydrofracture. Given that surface melting and SGL development is predicted to play an increasingly important role in the surface mass balance of Antarctica, bridging these gaps will help constrain predictions of future rapid ice loss from Antarctica.

M.; Van Ogtrop, Floris; Gleason, Frank H.; Sime-Ngando, Telesphore			Microbial players involved in the decline of filamentous and colonial cyanobacterial blooms with a focus on fungal parasitism	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												In the forthcoming decades, it is widely believed that the dominance of colonial and filamentous bloom-forming cyanobacteria (e.g. Microcystis, Planktothrix, Anabaena and Cylindrospermopsis) will increase in freshwater systems as a combined result of anthropogenic nutrient input into freshwater bodies and climate change. While the physicochemical parameters controlling bloom dynamics are well known, the role of biotic factors remains comparatively poorly studied. Morphology and toxicity often - but not always - limit the availability of cyanobacteria to filter feeding zooplankton (e.g. cladocerans). Filamentous and colonial cyanobacteria are widely regarded as trophic dead-ends mostly inedible for zooplankton, but substantial evidence shows that some grazers (e.g. copepods) can bypass this size constraint by breaking down filaments, making the bloom biomass available to other zooplankton species. A wide range of algicidal bacteria (mostly from the Alcaligenes, Flavobacterium/Cytophaga group and Pseudomonas) and viruses (Podoviridae,Siphoviridae and Myoviridae) may also contribute to bloom control, via their lytic activity underpinned by a diverse array of mechanisms. Fungal parasitism by the Chytridiomycota remains the least studied. While each of these biotic factors has traditionally been studied in isolation, emerging research consistently point to complex interwoven interactions between biotic and environmental factors.					; Sime-Ngando, Télesphore/M-4134-2019; Gachon, Claire/C-2787-2009; Delphine, Latour/JOZ-2138-2023; Ogtrop, Floris/ABB-6115-2021	van Ogtrop, Floris/0000-0002-5505-3869; Macarthur, Deborah/0000-0002-4677-025X; Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/0000-0002-7240-5803; Gachon, Claire/0000-0002-3702-7472													1462-2912	1462-2920				AUG	2015	17	8					2573	2587		10.1111/1462-2920.12860	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.12860								25818470					WOS:000360048800003

However, the relationship between groundwater pollution characteristics and land use in alluvial plains is still unclear. In this study, the effects of land use on shallow groundwater quality and human health risk were investigated via two sampling campaigns in a typical alluvial plain, namely, Jianghan Plain, China. Results show that the shallow groundwater in this area was polluted by nitrogen (with average concentrations of 5.12 mg/L in the dry season and 4.46 mg/L in the rainy season) and phosphorus (0.29 and 0.13 mg/L in the two seasons, respectively). The nutrient concentrations during the dry season were significantly higher than those during the rainy season (p< 0.05). Correlation analysis indicated that the concentration of nutrients was significantly positively correlated with cultivated land and negatively correlated with water and residence, suggesting that land use patterns can affect the groundwater quality. The best buffer where land use patterns affect the total N concentration was about 1000 m for cultivated land and water, while the optimal ranges for ammonium N were about 1000 and 2500 m for the areas, respectively. For the total phosphorus, a radius of 2000 m leads to the best fitting effect on both areas. Human health risk assessment showed that the total health risk indexes in about 75% of the samples were higher than 1, indicating the potential risk of the shallow groundwater in this area to human health. The results indicate that land use patterns will greatly affect the shallow groundwater quality. Thus, adjusting the land use pattern can improve the water quality and reduce health risks. Identification and selection of appropriate management solutions for the groundwater protection should be based on not only water quality problems but also surface land use patterns.

J	Xia, YQ; Li, YF; Zhang, XY; Yan, XY				Xia, Yongqiu; Li, Yuefei; Zhang, Xinyu; Yan, Xiaoyuan			Nitrate source apportionment using a combined dual isotope, chemical and bacterial property, and Bayesian model approach in river systems	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Nitrate (NO3-) pollution is a serious problem worldwide, particularly in countries with intensive agricultural and population activities. Previous studies have used N-15-NO3- and O-18-NO3- to determine the NO3- sources in rivers. However, this approach is subject to substantial uncertainties and limitations because of the numerous NO3- sources, the wide isotopic ranges, and the existing isotopic fractionations. In this study, we outline a combined procedure for improving the determination of NO3- sources in a paddy agriculture-urban gradient watershed in eastern China. First, the main sources of NO3- in the Qinhuai River were examined by the dual-isotope biplot approach, in which we narrowed the isotope ranges using site-specific isotopic results. Next, the bacterial groups and chemical properties of the river water were analyzed to verify these sources. Finally, we introduced a Bayesian model to apportion the spatiotemporal variations of the NO3- sources. Denitrification was first incorporated into the Bayesian model because denitrification plays an important role in the nitrogen pathway. The results showed that fertilizer contributed large amounts of NO3- to the surface water in traditional agricultural regions, whereas manure effluents were the dominant NO3- source in intensified agricultural regions, especially during the wet seasons. Sewage effluents were important in all three land uses and exhibited great differences between the dry season and the wet season. This combined analysis quantitatively delineates the proportion of NO3- sources from paddy agriculture to urban river water for both dry and wet seasons and incorporates isotopic fractionation and uncertainties in the source compositions.					; Zhang, Xinyu/I-3021-2015; Li, Chuanyou/ABF-4143-2020; XIA, Yongqiu/D-6236-2017	Xia, Yongqiu/0000-0001-6856-5671; Zhang, Xinyu/0000-0001-8135-2144; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				JAN	2017	122	1					2	14		10.1002/2016JG003447	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016JG003447													WOS:000394944400001

Vulnerability of high-latitude soil organic carbon in North America to disturbance	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												This synthesis addresses the vulnerability of the North American high-latitude soil organic carbon (SOC) pool to climate change. Disturbances caused by climate warming in arctic, subarctic, and boreal environments can result in significant redistribution of C among major reservoirs with potential global impacts. We divide the current northern high-latitude SOC pools into (1) near-surface soils where SOC is affected by seasonal freeze-thaw processes and changes in moisture status, and (2) deeper permafrost and peatland strata down to several tens of meters depth where SOC is usually not affected by short-term changes. We address key factors (permafrost, vegetation, hydrology, paleoenvironmental history) and processes (C input, storage, decomposition, and output) responsible for the formation of the large high-latitude SOC pool in North America and highlight how climate-related disturbances could alter this pool's character and size. Press disturbances of relatively slow but persistent nature such as top-down thawing of permafrost, and changes in hydrology, microbiological communities, pedological processes, and vegetation types, as well as pulse disturbances of relatively rapid and local nature such as wildfires and thermokarst, could substantially impact SOC stocks. Ongoing climate warming in the North American high-latitude region could result in crossing environmental thresholds, thereby accelerating press disturbances and increasingly triggering pulse disturbances and eventually affecting the C source/sink net character of northern high-latitude soils. Finally, we assess postdisturbance feedbacks, models, and predictions for the northern high-latitude SOC pool, and discuss data and research gaps to be addressed by future research.					; Frolking, Steve/ABF-9046-2021; Wickland, Kimberly/AAU-2963-2021; French, Nancy/I-5975-2019; Grosse, Guido/F-5018-2011; Turetsky, Merritt/B-1255-2013; Schuur, Edward/ACG-9944-2022	French, Nancy/0000-0002-2389-3003; Waldrop, Mark/0000-0003-1829-7140; Grosse, Guido/0000-0001-5895-2141; Marchenko, Sergey/0000-0003-3084-176X; Harden, Jennifer W/0000-0002-6570-8259; Wickland, Kimberly/0000-0002-6400-0590; Bourgeau-Chavez, Laura/0000-0001-7127-279X													2169-8953	2169-8961				JUL 28	2011	116								G00K06	10.1029/2010JG001507	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2010JG001507													WOS:000293375800001
J	Liu, D; Duan, HT; Yu, SJ; Shen, M; Xue, K				Liu, Dong; Duan, Hongtao; Yu, Shujie; Shen, Ming; Xue, Kun			Human-induced eutrophication dominates the bio-optical compositions of suspended particles in shallow lakes: Implications for remote sensing	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Suspended particulate matter (SPM) is generally divided into inorganic (SPIM) and organic (SPOM) parts; they come from different sources, and have different impacts on the optical properties and/or water quality of lake. However, in a specific remote sensing process, they are not retrieved separately. Using in-situ data of 59 lakes along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLR-YR) in dry season (April) and wet season (August) in 2012, we first studied the absorption properties and sources of different SPM. On this basis, we proposed a workflow for simultaneously estimating SPIM and SPOM from satellite data. Our results are as follows: Bio-optical compositions of SPM in these eutrophic shallow lakes tempo-spatially varied greatly and were dominated by human-induced eutrophication. Phytoplankton contributed 18.42 +/- 18.92% of SPIM and 26.22 +/- 1924% of SPOM in April 2012, but 30.4 +/- 23.41% of SPIM and 47.03 +/- 18.1% of SPOM in August 2012. The trophic state index explained 42.84% of SPOM variation in April 2012, and 54.64% in August 2012. Moreover, there were strong linear relationships between SPIM concentration and non-algal particle absorption coefficient (Pearson's r = 0.73; p < 0.01) and between SPOM concentration and phytoplankton absorption coefficient (r = 0.76; p < 0.01). Based on these results, SPIM and SPOM concentrations in the lakes along the MLR-YR could be retrieved from OLCI/Sentinel-3A satellite data, respectively. This study has a great significance for real-time monitoring and managing aquatic environment in various eutrophic and/or shallow lakes as a group. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All tights reserved.

Many studies have proposed algorithms between Landsat data and in-situ water quality parameters using classical regression models. The novelty of this paper is that we developed algorithms to determine log-transformed chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) and Secchi disk transparency (SDT) in Rio Tercero reservoir using Landsat TM and ETM + imagery, ancillary environmental factors and linear mixed models (LMM), obtaining an increase in the accuracy of the estimates. The validation results showed that LMM with spatial correlation structure that take into account water surface temperature (WST) and rainfall were the most suitable method for estimating these parameters. WST derived from the Landsat thermal band was also validated. The algorithms were used to generate quantitative maps providing spatially and temporally rich information on patterns of water quality throughout the reservoir. Water quality features related to the hydrogeomorphology of the reservoir, typical seasonality and influx from the cooling system of a local nuclear reactor were identified in the time series maps.

However, the effects of MRSF on double-cropping rice profitability and agronomic traits are unclear. Here, experiments were conducted in two sites at Dongting Lake to determine the yield and economic benefits of MRSF and the optimal N application rate. Six fertilization treatments for early- and late-season rice at various N rates (0/0, 90/99, 105/116, 120/132, 135/149, and 150/165 kg N ha- 1) were tested. The grain yield of early-season rice (ESR) was the highest (8.7 t ha- 1) under 70 % deep fertilization (DF), whereas that of late-season rice (LSR) was the highest (6.1 t ha- 1) under 80 % DF treatment in Miluo. The grain yield of ESR and LSR (7.5 and 7.9 t ha- 1, respectively) were the highest under 80 % DF treatment in Yiyang. Compared with conventional fertilization (CF), MRSF significantly enhanced grain yield by 0.5 %-20.2 % and 5.3 %-15.0 % in Miluo and Yiyang, respectively. The high grain yield under MRSF can be attributed to higher leaf area index, chlorophyll content, nutrient uptake, biomass accumulation, and spikelet number per m2. Relative to CF, MRSF increased the panicle bearing tiller rate by 8.4 %-24.6 % (Miluo) and 3.3 %-12.2 % (Yiyang), thereby improving dry matter accumulation and nutrient uptake. Furthermore, the economic benefit under MRSF increased by 9.9 %-31.8 % (Miluo) and 15.0 %-25.7 % (Yiyang) compared with that under CF. N reduction in the MRSF treatments resulted in fewer effective panicles than the 100 % DF treatment. Improved yield and nutrient uptake in double-cropping rice were associated with deep fertilizer placement rather than N application rate. The number of filled grains per panicle had the strongest influence on ESR and LSR grain yield. Overall, MRSF is recommended as an alternative approach to increase grain yield, profitability, and agronomic traits while lowering the N application rate in the double-cropped rice systems near Dongting Lake, southern China.																			0378-4290	1872-6852				AUG 1	2021	270								108191	10.1016/j.fcr.2021.108191	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2021.108191		JUN 2021											WOS:000675892800010

However, community assembly of testate amoebae is not well understood, especially with regard to the relative importance of the stochastic and deterministic processes over time. In this study, we used Illumina high-throughput sequencing to explore the community assembly of testate amoebae from surface waters in two reservoirs of subtropical China over a seven-year period. Majority of testate amoebae belonged to the rare taxa because their relative abundances were typically lower than 0.01% of the total eukaryotic plankton community. The testate amoeba community dynamics exhibited a stronger interannual than seasonal variation in both reservoirs. Further, species richness, rather than species turnover, accounted for the majority of community variation. Environmental variables explained less than 20% of the variation in community composition of testate amoebae, and the community assembly appeared to be strongly driven by stochastic processes. Based on the Sloan neutral community model, it was found that neutral processes explained more than 65% of community variation. More importantly, the Stegen null model analysis showed that the stochastic processes (e.g., ecological drift) explained a significantly higher percentage of community assembly than deterministic processes over seven years, although deterministic processes were more influential in certain years.

Death and Decomposition in Aquatic Ecosystems	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Resource subsidies affect nutrient cycling, species interactions, and food webs in ways that influence ecosystem structure and function, but their effects depend on the history, magnitude, and recurrence frequency of the subsidies. In aquatic ecosystems, plant detritus has been considered the predominant form of such subsidies; however, while considered less abundant in many ecosystems, carrion represents subsidies with relatively rapid turnover and highly concentrated nutrient and energy release that can have strong and lasting effects on ecosystems. Carrion subsidies can be both autochthonous or allochthonous, and come in the form of natural senescence or disease-related non-consumptive mortality, phenology-based programed death (e.g., salmon spawning and death), or stochastic and episodic events (e.g., mass fish die-offs). All aquatic ecosystems have some level of non-consumptive mortality that provides a background level of carcasses to aquatic ecosystems, while others have a natural history of carrion resource subsidies (e.g., natural salmon-bearing streams), and some have only recently been exposed to phenology-based carrion subsidies (e.g., anthropogenic salmon introductions around the world). Many aquatic ecosystems experience episodic subsidies in the form of unexpected mass mortalities (e.g., eutrophication-, disease-, or climate-related mass die-offs) or have seasonally dependent pulses, like that of marine or lake snow in the form of zooplankton carcasses. The responses of ecosystems to these different histories and frequencies of carrion subsidies have often been independently investigated, with little effort to compare and bridge research boundaries in the broader context of resource subsidies. In this review, we provide a synthesis of how pulsed carrion nutrient and energy subsidies have widespread and lasting impacts on many aquatic ecosystems. We do this with a synthesis of literature from freshwater and marine ecosystems along three themes of how carrion is produced and decomposes: autochthonous and allochthonous necromass; phenology-based mortality; and stochastic and episodic mass mortality subsidies. Studies of charismatic megafauna carrion (e.g., whales) have described significant impacts in deep ocean systems, but much less is understood for other groups of animals. Quantifying the energy, nutrient, and foodweb effects of carrion is needed for more species and among habitats to more fully understand how ubiquitous forms of necromass contribute to aquatic ecosystem structure and function.

The conventional hydrochemical indexes and the eigenvalues of sulfur and oxygen isotopes were tested and analyzed. The results suggested the following: (1) The SO42- content showed seasonal changes: low-flow seasons > mid-flow seasons > high-flow seasons. (2) Based on delta S-34(SO4) and delta O-18(SO4) isotope analyses, the main source of SO42- was the dissolution of evaporite salt rocks in the stratum of the upstream area. The SO42- in the subsidence area was mainly from the river water supply, mine drainage and coal gangue leaching. The high concentration of SO42- in the mine drainage was mainly from the dissolution of evaporative salt rocks. (3) The calculation results of the ternary mixing model showed that the SO42- in the subsidence area water was affected by mine drainage and gangue leaching to different degrees. The results showed that the sulfate contribution proportion of the river water source to the subsidence area water was 35.8-65.9%; the sulfate contribution proportion of the mine drainage source to the subsidence area water was 2.0-26.6%; and the sulfate contribution proportion of the gangue leaching end source ranged from 16.3% to 56.9%. Coal mining activities had an important impact on the sulfate in the subsidence area water.																			0269-4042	1573-2983				SEP	2020	42	9					2865	2879		10.1007/s10653-020-00525-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-020-00525-2		FEB 2020						32026272					WOS:000515858500001

An Assessment of Seasonal Water Quality in Phewa Lake, Nepal, by Integrating Geochemical Indices and Statistical Techniques: A Sustainable Approach	WATER												Lakes are vital freshwater ecosystems that sustain biodiversity, support livelihoods, and drive socio-economic growth globally. However, they face escalating threats from anthropogenic activities, including urbanization, agricultural runoff, and pollution, which are exacerbated by climate change. Phewa Lake in Nepal was selected for this study due to its increasing rates of nutrient enrichment, sedimentation, and pollution. This study evaluated seasonal and spatial water quality variations within the lake by analyzing water samples from 30 sites during the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Twenty physicochemical parameters, including the potential of hydrogen (pH), dissolved oxygen (DO), electrical conductivity (EC), and major ions, e.g., calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), bicarbonate (HCO3-), chloride (Cl-), sulfate (SO42-), nitrate (NO3-), phosphate (PO43-), and ammonium (NH4+), were measured. The average pH ranged from 8.06 (pre-monsoon) to 8.24 (post-monsoon), reflecting dilution from monsoon rains and increased carbonate runoff. Furthermore, the DO levels in Phewa Lake averaged 7.46 mg/L (pre-monsoon) and 8.62 mg/L (post-monsoon), with higher values observed post-monsoon due to rainfall-driven oxygenation. Nutrient concentrations were shown to be elevated, with the nitrate concentration reaching 2.31 mg/L during the pre-monsoon period, and the phosphate concentration peaking at 0.15 mg/L in the post-monsoon period, particularly near agricultural runoff zones. The dominant cations in the lake's hydrochemistry were Ca2+ and Mg2+, while HCO3- was the primary anion, reflecting the influence of carbonate weathering. Cluster analysis identified the lake outlet as a high-pollution zone, with the total dissolved solids (TDS) reaching 108-135 mg/L. Additionally, Principal component analysis revealed agricultural runoff and sewage effluents as the main pollution sources. Seasonal dynamics highlighted monsoon-induced dilution and pre-monsoon pollution peaks. These findings underscore the need for targeted pollution control and eutrophication management. By aligning with the sustainable development goals (SDGs) relevant to clean water and climate action, this research provides a replicable framework for sustainable lake management that is applicable to freshwater ecosystems worldwide.					kumar, Amit/M-3541-2015; Saqr, Ahmed/D-7771-2015; Đurin, Bojan/AAW-6282-2021; Durin, Bojan/W-1782-2017; Awasthi, Mahesh/LTV-8908-2024; Kumar, Amit/M-3541-2015; Ramesh, Pant/AAC-9696-2020	kumar, Amit/0000-0002-6073-0860; Awasthi, Mahesh Prasad/0009-0009-6581-1473; Saqr, Ahmed/0000-0002-3458-1208; Durin, Bojan/0000-0002-2361-8036; PANT, Ramesh Raj/0000-0002-6170-0188; 														2073-4441				JAN	2025	17	2							238	10.3390/w17020238	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17020238													WOS:001404777700001

The flood hazard within the sub-basin of Lake Tana causes damage to cropland, properties, and a fatality every season. Therefore, flood susceptibility modeling in this area is significant for hazard reduction and management purposes. Thus, the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), bivariate (information value [IV] and frequency ratio [FR]), and multivariate (logistic regression [LR]) statistical methods were applied. Using an intensive field survey, historical document, and Google Earth Imagery, 1,404-flood locations were determined, classified into 70% training datasets and 30% testing flood datasets using a subset within the geographic information system (GIS) environment. The statistical relationship between the probability of flood occurrence and 11 flood-driving factors was performed using the GIS tool. The flood susceptibility maps of the study area were developed by summing all weighted aspects using a raster calculator. It is classified into very low, low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility classes using the natural breaks method. The accuracy and performance of the models were evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC). As the result indicated, the FR model has better performance (AUC = 99.1%) compared to the AHP model (AUC = 86.9%), LR model (AUC = 81.4%), and IV model (AUC = 78.2%). This research finds out that the applied methods are quite worthy for flood susceptibility modeling within the study area. In flood susceptibility modeling, method selection is not a serious challenge; the care should tend to the input parameter quality. Based on the AUC values, the FR model is comparatively better, followed by the AHP model for regional land use planning, flood hazard mitigation, and prevention purposes.					wubalem, Azemeraw/KAO-2647-2024; Wubalem, Azemeraw/AAN-8539-2021; JOTHIMANI, MURALITHARAN/ADV-8548-2022	wubalem, Azemeraw/0000-0002-5965-6608; JOTHIMANI, MURALITHARAN/0000-0002-3766-0665; 													2391-5447					DEC 27	2021	13	1					1668	1688		10.1515/geo-2020-0329	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/geo-2020-0329													WOS:000735112900001

Consumer trophic positions respond variably to seasonally fluctuating environments	ECOLOGY												The effects of environmental seasonality on food web structure have been notoriously understudied in empirical ecology. Here, we focus on seasonal changes in one key attribute of a food web, consumer trophic position. We ask whether fishes inhabiting tropical river-floodplain ecosystems behave as seasonal omnivores, by shifting their trophic positions in relation to the annual flood pulse, or whether they feed at the same trophic position all year, as much empirical work implicitly assumes. Using dietary data from the Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia, and a literature review, we find evidence that some fishes, especially small piscivores, increased consumption of invertebrates and/or plant material during the wet season, as predicted. However, nitrogen stable isotope (delta N-15) data for 26 Tonle Sap fishes, spanning a broader range of functional groups, uncovered high variation in seasonal trophic position responses among species (0 to +/- 0.52 trophic positions). Based on these findings, species respond to the flood pulse differently. Diverse behavioral responses to seasonality, underpinned by spatiotemporal variation at multiple scales, could be central for rerouting matter and energy flow in these dynamic ecosystems. Seasonally flexible foraging behaviors warrant further study given their potential influence on food web dynamics in a range of fluctuating environments.

A Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and differential evolution (DE) algorithm were coupled to automatically provide a calculation of the WEC in a daily step. The results showed that the largest ideal WECs occurred in the wet season with values up to 4500 t and 80 t for total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), respectively. The ideal WEC had a positive correlation with the rainfall intensity, while the opposite was true for actual WEC. The smallest value of actual WEC for TN was -150 tin June, and a negative value also occurred in June for TP. This is because NPS pollution discharge was more sensitive to rainfall and flow change than the ideal WEC. Compared to phosphorus, the WEC of nitrogen was more affected by the hydrological and NPS pollution discharge conditions. In addition, the WEC of nitrogen and phosphorus in organic species was more affected by seasonal change than that of nitrogen and phosphorus in inorganic species. Spatially, the channels in the middle and southeast of the study area had the smallest actual WEC and even negative values were observed. The results of remnant WEC showed that the smallest value occurred in July and June with values of - 800 t and -140 t for TN and TP, respectively. Thus, significant attention should be paid to controlling NPS pollution during the wet season, and organic nitrogen and phosphorus should be set as the priority pollutants to control. Furthermore, controlling the NPS pollution discharge and enhancing the WEC should be carried out simultaneously. Compared to previously used methods, the calculation method employed in this study had the ability to simulate the transformation and interaction between nitrogen and phosphorus in organic and inorganic species, and better considered dynamic changes in the input conditions.					; Wang, Qingrui/AAC-5564-2021	Wang, Qingrui/0000-0002-0852-0743; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				FEB	2019	569						155	166		10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.12.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.12.003													WOS:000457952900013
J	Fork, ML; Sponseller, RA; Laudon, H				Fork, Megan L.; Sponseller, Ryan A.; Laudon, Hjalmar			Changing Source-Transport Dynamics Drive Differential Browning Trends in a Boreal Stream Network	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations are increasing in freshwaters worldwide, with important implications for aquatic ecology, biogeochemistry, and ecosystem services. While multiple environmental changes may be responsible for these trends, predicting the occurrence and magnitude of "browning" and relating such trends to changes in DOC sources versus hydrologic transport remain key challenges. We analyzed long-term trends in DOC concentration from the two dominant landscape sources (riparian soils and mire peats) and receiving streams in a boreal catchment to evaluate how browning patterns relate to land cover and hydrology. Increases in stream DOC were widespread but not universal. Browning was most pronounced in small, forested streams, where trends corresponded to twofold to threefold increases in DOC production in riparian soils and increases in annual DOC export from a forested headwater. By contrast, DOC did not change in mire peats or streams draining catchments with high lake or mire cover, nor did we observe trends in DOC export from a mire-dominated headwater. The distinct long-term trends in DOC sources also altered concentration-discharge relationships, with a forested headwater shifting from transport-limited toward chemostasis, and a mire outlet stream shifting from chemostasis to source-limitated. Modified DOC supply to headwaters, together with altered seasonal hydrology and differences in the dominant water source along the stream network gave rise to predictable browning trends and consistent concentration-discharge relationships. Overall, our results show that the sources of DOC to boreal aquatic ecosystems are responding to environmental change in fundamentally different ways, with important consequences for browning along boreal stream networks.					; Sponseller, Ryan/ABI-7338-2020; Fork, Megan/AAG-8474-2019; Laudon, Hjalmar/J-3074-2013	Fork, Megan/0000-0002-7789-3316; Laudon, Hjalmar/0000-0001-6058-1466; Sponseller, Ryan/0000-0002-5758-2705													0043-1397	1944-7973				FEB	2020	56	2							e2019WR026336	10.1029/2019WR026336	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019WR026336													WOS:000535672800041

In this study, phytoplankton diversity was studied using traditional microscopic techniques and the bacterial communities associated with phytoplankton bloom were studied using High Throughput Sequencing ((HTS) analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons from the V1-V3 and V3-V4 hypervariable regions. Samples were collected from Lake Akersvannet, a eutrophic lake in South Norway, during the growth season from June to August 2013. Microscopic examination revealed that the phytoplankton community was mostly represented by Cyanobacteria and the dinoflagellate Ceratium hirundinella. The HTS results revealed that Proteobacteria ((Alpha, Beta, and Gamma), Bacteriodetes, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia dominated the bacterial community, with varying relative abundances throughout the sampling season. Species level identification of Cyanobacteria showed a mixed population of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Microcystis aeruginosa and Woronichinia naegeliana. A significant proportion of the microbial community was composed of unclassified taxa which might represent locally adapted freshwater bacterial groups. Comparison of cyanobacterial species composition from HTS and microscopy revealed quantitative discrepancies, indicating a need for cross validation of results. To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses HTS methods for studying the bacterial community associated with phytoplankton blooms in a Norwegian lake. The study demonstrates the value of considering results from multiple methods when studying bacterial communities.					; Kolekar, Pandurang/ABF-7389-2020; Kulkarni-Kale, Urmila/G-6946-2011; Sabo, Mona/LFR-5673-2024	Jenkins, Andrew/0000-0003-2588-8483; Kolekar, Pandurang/0000-0003-0044-0076; 													1932-6203					MAR 10	2017	12	3							e173408	10.1371/journal.pone.0173408	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173408								28282404					WOS:000396091800038

Flow velocity, suspended sediment concentration, and sediment deposition were measured within and without vegetation at four sites covered by Phragmites communis (reed), Artemisia selengensis, Carex cinerascens, and a mix of them. Results show that the presence of vegetation reduced the time-averaged velocity and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and altered vertical distributions of the time-averaged velocity and TKE. For emergent conditions, both the time-averaged velocity and the TKE were uniformly distributed through the entire water column. Two layers were separated at the top of vegetation for submerged conditions. Within vegetation both the time-averaged velocity and TKE were decreased and uniformly distributed, similar to observations under emergent conditions. The discontinuity of drag force at the top of vegetation generated a region with rapidly increased velocity near the vegetation interface. TKE reached its maximum near the top of vegetation and decreased gradually toward both bed bottom and water surface. In present study, canopy with larger frontal area caused bigger reduction of time-averaged velocity and TKE within vegetation. By reducing the mean and turbulent velocities, the presence of vegetation decreased the depth-averaged suspended sediment concentration by 30-50% and increased the thickness of sediment deposited over one flood season by as high as 190% when compared with bare bed.					; Zhang, Yinghao/CAH-8914-2022; LAI, Xijun/F-8722-2010	Zhang, Yinghao/0000-0001-5230-6376; Yao, xin/0000-0002-4151-8784; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				MAY	2020	584								124644	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124644	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124644													WOS:000527390200092

Bacteria in the samples were analyzed by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene through Roche 454 and Illumina miseq sequencing platforms. 31 phyla, 66 classes, 90 orders, 213 families and 697 bacterial genera were detected in samples collected at 6 time points; 6 bacterial genera were found in all samples. Microbial richness and diversity indexes were significantly higher for sediment samples than that for water samples. Bacterial phyla with more than 10% abundance were Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria/Chloroplast, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes in water samples, and Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria/Chloroplast, Firmicutes, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi and Bacteroidetes in sediment samples, but the dominant microbes changed seasonally. The composition and abundance of the dominant microbes showed no substantially correlation between water and sediment samples collected at the same time. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) or redundancy analysis (RDA) was used for ordination to address the relationship between microbial communities and environmental factors, the results showed that ammonia nitrogen (AN) and total nitrogen (TN) contents in water had the greatest influence on bacterial communities. Abundance of the pathogenic bacterial genera Pseudomonas and Aeromonas but not the probiotic bacterial genus Bacillus correlated negatively with AN, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and TN, and positively with pH value and water temperature (WT). Abundance of the pathogenic bacterial genus Flavobacterium and probiotic bacterial genus Bdellovibrio correlated positively with pH, TN, and COD, and negatively with WT and AN. These findings provided novel information about improving microflora in aquaculture environments and inhibiting pathogens to reduce L. vannamei disease by regulating environmental factors, however for practical applications more research of comprehensively functional relationship among the variables is further needed. Statement of relevance This paper provides the extremely relevant to the development of commercial aquaculture. Our findings provided novel information about improving microflora in aquaculture environments and inhibiting pathogens to reduce L. vannamei disease by regulating environmental factors. Thus it is beneficial to improve commercial aquaculture. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Chen, X; Jiang, L; Huang, XL; Cai, ZC				Chen, Xi; Jiang, Ling; Huang, Xiaoli; Cai, Zucong			Identifying nitrogen source and transport characteristics of the urban estuaries and gate-controlled rivers in northern Taihu Lake, China	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Revealing nitrogen source and transport mechanisms are essential to achieving optimal nitrogen management in urban estuaries and gate-controlled rivers. However, in plains river networks, gate and/or dam construction make the nitrogen sources difficult to trace. In this study, seasonal water samples from typical urban estuaries and gate-controlled rivers in northern Taihu Lake were analyzed using statistical analysis and stable isotope analysis in R (SIAR). The results show that the concentrations of various nitrogen forms showed obvious spatial-temporal distribution characteristics by multiple sources. Specifically, the nitrogen concentration was lower during the wet season than the dry season (T = 6.02, p < 0.01). Gate construction had a dual effect on the water environment, because it changed both the nitrogen transport processes and the nitrogen enrichment risk between the river side and lake side. The 818O-NO3- and 815N-NO3- values were sensitive to anthropogenic activity intensity and urbanization process, showing the following order of 815N-NO3- values: Countryside > Suburbs > Downtown, and Construction Land > Forest-grassland > Farmland. While, a contrary trend was observed among the variations in 818O-NO3- values. According to the SIAR model, sewage/manure, fertilizer, and sediment nitrogen (sediment N) were the main nitrate sources, accounting for 42.68%, 23.79%, and 23.71%, respectively. The proportion of urban nitrogen discharge has surpassed that of agricultural sources, becoming the largest nitrogen source in the waterbody. Under the coupling of meteorological conditions and estuary shape, the endogenous nitrogen released from sediment became the second largest contributor in some estuaries. These findings suggest that it is necessary to strengthen the control of urban exogenous nitrogen input and sediment nitrogen endogenous release to enable future estuarine nitrogen management and habitat restoration.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				NOV	2021	130								108035	10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108035		JUL 2021											WOS:000692515900003

For economic reasons, BMPs should be placed at critical source areas (CSAs), which are the areas contributing most of the NPS pollution. The CSAs are the areas in a watershed where source coincides with transport factors, such as runoff, erosion, subsurface flow, and channel processes. Methods ranging from simple index-based to detailed hydrologic and water quality (HWQ) models are being used to identify CSAs. However, application of these methods for Canadian watersheds remains challenging due to the diversified hydrological conditions, which are not fully incorporated into most existing methods. The aim of this work is to review potential methods and challenges in identifying CSAs under Canadian conditions. As such, this study: (a) reviews different methods for identifying CSAs; (b) discusses challenges and the current state of CSA identification; and (c) highlights future research directions to address limitations of currently available methods. It appears that applications of both simple index-based methods and detailed HWQ models to determine CSAs are limited in Canadian conditions. As no single method/model is perfect, it is recommended to develop a 'Toolbox' that can host a variety of methods to identify CSAs so as to allow flexibility to the end users on the choice of the methods.					; Rudra, Ramesh/AAA-7267-2022; Biswas, Asim/D-1859-2015; Shukla, Rituraj/AAX-9876-2021; Daggupati, Prasad/D-8886-2017	Shukla, Rituraj/0000-0003-4543-8981; Goel, Pradeep/0000-0002-0695-5321; Biswas, Asim/0000-0003-0801-3546; 														2077-0472				OCT	2020	10	10							468	10.3390/agriculture10100468	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10100468													WOS:000584506200001

The total concentrations of these antibiotics ranged among 17.73-281.82, 22.98-258.45, 22.43-198.95 ng L-1 and 131.65-750.27 ng g(-1) in surface water, overlying water, pore water and sediments, respectively. Seasonal variation might be impacted by the frequency of different pattern of antibiotics and the water temperatures of different seasons, where the higher concentrations appeared at different seasons. In addition, the regions with significant sewage discharge or human agricultural activities exhibited high concentrations of antibiotics in water and sediments. The highest accumulation rates of the four antibiotics ranged from 11.27 to 29.71%, which indicated that these compounds exhibited strong adsorption to the sediment. However, higher concentrations of antibiotics in pore water and even overlying water may result in the release of these compounds from the sediment acting as a secondary contaminant source in a certain time period, especially for TC. The pseudo-partitioning values of fluoroquinolones (FQs) ranged from 4493 to 47,093 L kg(-1) and were much higher than those of tetracyclines (TCs), which ranged from 277 to 1880 L kg(-1) indicating that the FQs are prone to accumulation in the sediment.

Poyang Lake is China's largest freshwater lake with complex hydrological relationships and unique rhythmic changes. There is no systematic understanding of the relationship between lake watershed area and river-lake connectivity. In this study, using remote sensing imagery, hydrological data, meteorological data, and land use surveys, we investigated changes in the Poyang Lake water area from 1977-2021. In addition, we examined the relationship between the lake water area and potential impact factors and analyzed the influence of river-lake interactions on the lake water area. The results showed that the water area of Poyang Lake decreased during the study period. River runoff and sediment load changes in the Poyang Lake basin are the main factors affecting the lake water area. Additionally, the Three Gorges Dam water impoundment situated in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River weakened and eliminated the block and reverse flow of the Yangtze River into the Poyang Lake, causing the water area to decrease toward the end of the flood season in 2005 and in the dry season in 2003. Changes in the lakebed elevation caused by sedimentation and anthropogenic activities have also accelerated the shrinkage of the water area. Overall, the results of this study indicate that variations in the river-lake interactions are the primary cause of the significant changes observed in the Poyang Lake water area in the last five decades.

J	Thamaga, KH; Dube, T				Thamaga, Kgabo H.; Dube, Timothy			Understanding seasonal dynamics of invasive water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) in the Greater Letaba river system using Sentinel-2 satellite data	GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING												Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) is one of the most aggressive and lethal free-floating aquatic weed that degrades and chokes freshwater ecosystems and threatens aquatic life. Early detection and up-to-date information regarding its distribution is, therefore, crucial in understanding its spatial configuration and propagation rate. The present study, thus, sought to map the seasonal dynamics of invasive water hyacinth, in Greater Letaba river system in Limpopo Province, South Africa, using Sentinel-2 data and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Classification test results showed that seasonal water hyacinth distribution patterns can be accurately detected and mapped, using Sentinel-2 data with high accuracies. Water hyacinth was mapped with an overall accuracy of 80.79% during the wet season, and 79.04% during the dry season, with kappa coefficients of 0.76 and 0.724, respectively, using combined vegetation indices and spectral bands. The use of spectral bands (wet: 79.48% and dry: 75.98%) and vegetation indices (wet: 76.42% and dry: 74.42%) as independent dataset yielded slighter lower accuracies when compared to the use of the combined dataset. Further, areal coverage results showed that approximately 63.82% and 28.34% of the river system was infested with water hyacinth during wet and dry seasons, respectively. Findings of this study underscore the importance of new generation sensors in detecting and mapping the seasonal distribution of water hyacinth in river systems. Overall such findings provide a baseline or provide a framework for developing invasive aquatic species management and eradication strategies.

This dataset was supported by 6843 digital raster images (1:100000 and 1:50000), a countrywide digital vector dataset (1:250000), and historical literature. Comparative data were corrected for seasonal variations using precipitation data. There are presently 2693 natural lakes in China with an area greater than 1.0 km(2), excluding reservoirs. These lakes are distributed in 28 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities and have a total area of 81414.6 km(2), accounting for similar to 0.9% of China's total land area. In the past 30 years, the number of newly formed and newly discovered lakes with an area greater than 1.0 km(2) is 60 and 131, respectively. Conversely, 243 lakes have disappeared in this time period.

Biology, ecology, and management of starry stonewort (Nitellopsis obtusa; Characeae): A Red-listed Eurasian green alga invasive in North America	AQUATIC BOTANY												Nitellopsis obtusa (starry stonewort) is a green macroalga (family Characeae) native to Europe and Asia that is of conservation concern in its native range but expanding in North America. We synthesize current science on N. obtusa and identify key knowledge gaps. Nitellopsis obtusa is able to reproduce sexually or asexually via fragments and bulbils. Native populations reproduce primarily asexually; sexual fertility increases with longer growing seasons and in shallower waters. In North America, only males have been observed. Nitellopsis obtusa has been known from North America for four decades and confirmed in seven U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. It is typically associated with low-flow areas of lakes with alkaline to neutral pH and elevated conductivity. Nitellopsis obtusa has ecological benefits in its native range, contributing to food webs and water clarity. In its invaded range, N. obtusa could negatively influence native macrophytes and habitat quality, but there has been little research on impacts. There have been many efforts to control N. obtusa through physical removal or chemical treatments, but little systematic evaluation of outcomes. Substantial areas of uncertainty regarding N. obtusa include controls on reproduction, full distribution in North America, ecological impacts, and control strategies.					; Monfils, Anna/P-6982-2019; Larkin, Daniel/IVV-7477-2023	Larkin, Daniel/0000-0001-6378-0495; Monfils, Anna/0000-0003-3553-6430; Boissezon, Aurelie/0000-0001-8403-4547; Cahill, Blake/0000-0001-9690-882X													0304-3770	1879-1522				AUG	2018	148						15	24		10.1016/j.aquabot.2018.04.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2018.04.003													WOS:000433652600003

Thus, there is an urgent need for spatially-detailed information of current thermal growing season (GS) conditions and their past changes. Here, we deployed a large network of weather stations, high-resolution geospatial environmental data and semi-parametric regression to model the spatial variation in multiple GS variables (i.e. beginning, end, length, degree day sum [GDDS, base temperature + 5 degrees C]) and their intra-annual variability and temporal trends in respect to geographical location, topography, water and forest cover, and urban land use variables over northern Europe. Our analyses revealed substantial spatial variability in average GS conditions (1990-2019) and consistent temporal trends (1950-2019). We showed that there have been significant changes in thermal GS towards earlier beginnings (on average 15 days over the study period), increased length (23 days) and GDDS (287 degrees C days). By using a spatial interpolation of weather station data to a regular grid we predicted current GS conditions at high resolution (100 m x 100 m) and with high accuracy (correlation >= 0.92 between observed and predicted mean GS values), whereas spatial variation in temporal trends and interannual variability were more demanding to predict. The spatial variation in GS variables was mostly driven by latitudinal and elevational gradients, albeit they were constrained by local scale variables. The proximity of sea and lakes, and high forest cover suppressed temporal trends and inter-annual variability potentially indicating local climate buffering. The produced high-resolution datasets showcased the diversity in thermal GS conditions and impacts of climate change over northern Europe. They are valuable in various forest management and ecosystem applications, and in adaptation to climate change.

J	Nguyen, HQ; Ha, NT; Pham, TL				Hao-Quang Nguyen; Nam-Thang Ha; Thanh-Luu Pham			Inland harmful cyanobacterial bloom prediction in the eutrophic Tri An Reservoir using satellite band ratio and machine learning approaches	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												In recent years, Tri An, a drinking water reservoir for millions of people in southern Vietnam, has been affected by harmful cyanobacterial blooms (HCBs), raising concerns about public health. It is, therefore, crucial to gain insights into the outbreak mechanism of HCBs and understand the spatiotemporal variations of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in this highly turbid and productive water. This study aims to evaluate the predictable performance of both approaches using satellite band ratio and machine learning for Chl-a concentration retrieval-a proxy of HCBs. The monthly water quality samples collected from 2016 to 2018 and 23 cloud free Sentinel-2A/B scenes were used to develop Chl-a retrieval models. For the band ratio approach, a strong linear relationship with in situ Chl-a was found for two-band algorithm of Green-NIR. The band ratio-based model accounts for 72% of variation in Chl-a concentration from 2016 to 2018 datasets with an RMSE of 5.95 mu g/L. For the machine learning approach, Gaussian process regression (GPR) yielded superior results for Chl-a prediction from water quality parameters with the values of 0.79 (R-2) and 3.06 mu g/L (RMSE). Among various climatic parameters, a high correlation (R-2 = 0.54) between the monthly total precipitation and Chl-a concentration was found. Our analysis also found nitrogen-rich water and TSS in the rainy season as the driving factors of observed HCBs in the eutrophic Tri An Reservoir (TAR), which offer important solutions to the management of HCBs in the future.

We obtained phenological information on Carex vegetation through MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data during 2001-2020, and monthly field investigation during 2011-2020. We then explored how these data were correlated with climatic factors and flood regimes in a Yangtze River-connected floodplain wetland (Dongting Lake, China). Our results showed that warmer temperature tended to advance the start of the pre-flooding growing season (SOS1), with a relative contribution of 76.1 %. Flood rising time strongly contributed to controlling the end of the pre-flooding growing season. Flood recession time and inundation duration were dominant factors determining the start of the post-flooding growing season (SOS2). Earlier flood recession time and shortened inundation duration tended to advance the SOS2. Shortened inundation duration, earlier flood recession time, and lower solar radiation tended to advance the end of the post-flooding growing season. The phenology of Carex distributed at highelevation areas was more affected by hydrology than that of Carex distributed at low-elevation areas. Thus, climatic factors strongly affect the phenology of Carex during the pre-flooding growing season, whereas flood regimes play a dominant role in determining the phenology in the post-flooding growing season. The different responses of Carex phenology to climatic and flooding factors may provide insights for the conservation and management of floodplain wetlands in Yangtze River because Carex are primary food source and habitat for herbivorous waterfowls.					; LI, feng/HIR-1703-2022; zeng, jing/JDW-4350-2023	Chen, Xin-sheng/0009-0009-6601-8725; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				NOV 15	2022	847								157568	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157568	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157568		JUL 2022						35882330					WOS:000884273800009

Does behavioural thermoregulation underlie seasonal movements in Lake Erie walleye?	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Thermoregulation is presumed to be a widespread determinant of behaviour in fishes, but has not often been investigated as a mechanism shaping long-distance migrations. We used acoustic telemetry and animal-borne thermal loggers to test the hypothesis that seasonal migration in adult walleye (Sander vitreus) in Lake Erie is size-and (or) sex-specific and related to behavioural thermoregulation. Female walleye migrated out of the warm, shallow western basin earlier than did males and were 1.8 times more likely to be detected on acoustic receivers in the deeper and cooler eastern basin. The few fish that remained in the western basin were restricted to a smaller range of higher temperatures (>= 20 degrees C) than those that migrated to the central and eastern basins (similar to 16-21 degrees C). However, temperature records from walleye in the central basin were nearly indistinguishable from those in the eastern basin, suggesting thermal preferences alone could not explain migration to the eastern basin. As such, our effort to understand the mechanisms that cause migratory behaviours has generated mixed evidence on the role of temperature and that factors like foraging opportunities may have synergistic roles in the migration.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010; Vandergoot, Christopher/JAO-1190-2023	Kraus, Richard/0000-0003-4494-1841; Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				MAR	2018	75	3					488	496		10.1139/cjfas-2017-0145	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2017-0145													WOS:000425811600013

Denitrification, anaerobic ammonium oxidation, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium in an East African Great Lake (Lake Kivu)	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We investigated anaerobic nitrogen (N) cycling in the water column of Lake Kivu, a deep meromictic tropical lake in East Africa. Data were collected at one station in the Northern Basin and one in the Southern Basin, during two sampling campaigns (June 2011-dry season, and February 2012-rainy season). Shortterm incubations of sulfide-free water with N-15-labeled substrates revealed high potential denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) rates (up to 350 and 36 nmol N produced L-1 h(-1), respectively), while anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) was lower (up to 3.3 nmol N produced L-1 h(-1)). However, anammox rates were 15 nmol N produced L-1 h(-1) when (NH4+)-N-15 was added at depths where NH4+ concentrations were very low (< 1 mu mol L-1). With the addition of 5 mu mol L-1 of (NO3-)-N-15 and 10 mu mol L-1 of H2S, denitrification and anammox were stimulated in the Northern Basin, while the increase of DNRA rates was less notable. In the Southern Basin, the addition of H2S decreased denitrification rates, probably because of competition with DNRA, which increased, while no effect was observed on anammox. This study puts into evidence the co-occurrence of denitrification, anammox and DNRA, for the first time in a great tropical lake, and underlines the spatial heterogeneity of these processes. Contrary to numerous reports in literature, we show that anammox can significantly occur in presence of H2S, suggesting that the contribution of anammox in the N cycle may be underestimated.					; Thamdrup, Bo/F-3889-2016; Darchambeau, Francois/AAX-1206-2021; Morana, Cedric/AAL-5025-2021; Borges, Alberto/C-4989-2008	Roland, Fleur/0000-0001-9012-6886; Morana, Cedric/0000-0002-5521-0414; Borges, Alberto V./0000-0002-5434-2247													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2018	63	2					687	701		10.1002/lno.10660	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10660													WOS:000427104700013

The wetland has a complicated hydrological regime and is subject to frequent human disturbance. We hypothesize that fluctuating hydrology and human activities have varied contributions to the temporal and spatial variations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the wetland. Soil (SS), sediment (SD), and water, to acquire dissolved phase (DP) and suspended particulate matter (SPM), samples were collected from eight locations during low- and highflow periods to elucidate multimedia phase distribution and transport of PAHs. Following the onset of the rainy season, the concentration of SPM-associated PAHs increased significantly, while the DP PAHs remained stable. Individual PAH ratios showed that, although pyrogenic sources are common, petrogenic derived compounds are the main source of PAHs in the Wang Lake Wetland. During the high-flow period, the empirical values for logarithms of the organic carbon-normalized partition coefficients (log KOC) of individual PAH-congeners were lower than the corresponding field-observed log KOC values from the SPM-DP and SD-DP systems, reflecting the complexity in evaluating multi-phase PAH partitioning. During the high-flow period, temperature-driven changes may have changed the sediment from a sink to a source for some high molecular weight PAHs. It was determined that human activities governed the PAH loading in the low-flow period, whereas during highflow conditions, increased rainfall, higher temperatures, and fishery activity are the main factors controlling PAH input to the Wang Lake Wetland.

J	Vasistha, P; Ganguly, R				Vasistha, Prachi; Ganguly, Rajiv			Assessment of spatio-temporal variations in lake water body using indexing method	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The study assesses the characteristics of two lakes located in close vicinity to each other in identifying the status of the lakes based on Designated Best Use (DBU) criteria for optimum utilization and use. Further, the study reports the characteristic assessment of the lakes for two seasons with sampling carried out in August and October months of 2019 and samples collected at different depths and locations to present the comprehensive existing water quality conditions of the lake. The study utilized about twenty parameters evaluated experimentally for determination of Water Quality Indices. In this context, different water quality indices including National Sanitation Foundation Method (NSFWQI) and BIS 10500 (BISWQI) were utilized in determining the indices. The WQI were determined depth wise and a weighted average method was utilized in presenting the overall WQI of the lakes which represents the true water quality based on depth wise evaluation. Hence, the study represents both spatial and temporal variations in the lake water quality. The overall classification of water quality for both the lakes using the NSFWQI methodology wasgoodfor both the sampling periods. Similarly, the overall water quality was categorized to beexcellentfor both the sampling periods using the BISWQI. Further, a new approach in determining water quality indexing is presented through introduction of aModified Water Quality Index (MWQI)which utilizes the maximum number of parameters and thereby provides a means to reduce ambiguity and eclipsing problems of WQI. Using this newly developed MWQI, the water quality was categorized to beexcellentandgoodfor samples collected in August and October respectively for both the lakes. However,conservativeestimation considering spillover effects may lead to classification ofgood categoryusing MWQI. The Heavy Metal Pollution Index (HMI) were classified to begoodfor both the lakes and sampling periods. Spectral characterization of water samples revealed the presence of oxygen (O), tantalum (Ta), sodium (Na) and Zinc (Zn). However, further monitoring studies are being carried out to cover a period of 1 year to observe if there is a change in water quality due or any seasonal variations.

Therefore, in the present study, sequential extraction method was used to determine the abundance of five sediment P fractions (calcium (Ca--P), Iron (Fe-P), aluminum (Al-P), exchangeable (Ex-P) and organic (Org-P) bound P) in Netravathi-Gurupur estuary, India. Total phosphorus (TP) content varied from 435-810 mg/kg (non-monsoon) and 258-699 mg/kg (monsoon). Inorganic P was dominant part. Different P fractions followed similar order (Fe-P > Ca-P > Al-P > Org-P > Ex-P) with respect to seasons. Fe-P was dominant fraction, indicating probable anthropogenic stress. Sediment may act as source of P as bioavailable P constituted 40-69.2 % of TP. Molar ratio of OC to Org-P in sediment indicated terrestrial sources of organic matter. However, the estimated phosphorus pollution index were lower than one except a few cases indicating less ecological risk with respect to sedimentary TP load.

Comparison of generalized non-data-driven lake and reservoir routing models for global-scale hydrologic forecasting of reservoir outflow at diurnal time steps	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Large-scale hydrologic forecasts should account for attenuation through lakes and reservoirs when flow regulation is present. Globally generalized methods for approximating outflow are required but must contend with operational complexity and a dearth of information on dam characteristics at global spatial scales. There is currently no consensus on the best approach for approximating reservoir release rates in large spatial scale hydrologic forecasting, particularly at diurnal time steps. This research compares two parsimonious reservoir routing methods at daily steps: Doll et al. (2003) and Hanasaki et al. (2006). These reservoir routing methods have been previously implemented in large-scale hydrologic modeling applications and have been typically evaluated seasonally. These routing methods are compared across 60 reservoirs operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The authors vary empirical coefficients for both reservoir routing methods as part of a sensitivity analysis. The method proposed by Doll et al. (2003) outperformed that presented by Hanasaki et al. (2006) at a daily time step and improved model skill over most run-of-the-river conditions. The temporal resolution of the model influences model performances. The optimal model coefficients varied across the reservoirs in this study and model performance fluctuates between wet years and dry years, and for different configurations such as dams in series. Overall, the method proposed by Doll et al. (2003) could enhance large-scale hydrologic forecasting, but can be subject to instability under certain conditions.					; Wahl, Mark/C-6896-2012	Follum, Michael/0000-0003-2720-3409; Wahl, Mark/0000-0002-2498-8602; Tavakoly, Ahmad A./0000-0002-2163-2627													1027-5606	1607-7938				MAY 27	2020	24	5					2711	2729		10.5194/hess-24-2711-2020	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2711-2020													WOS:000537701800001

However, to what extent elevated CO2 will induce evolutionary changes in photosynthetic organisms is still a major open question. Here, we show rapid microevolutionary adaptation of a harmful cyanobacterium to changes in inorganic carbon (C-i) availability. We studied the cyanobacterium Microcystis, a notorious genus that can develop toxic cyanobacterial blooms in many eutrophic lakes and reservoirs worldwide. Microcystis displays genetic variation in the C-i uptake systems BicA and SbtA, where BicA has a low affinity for bicarbonate but high flux rate, and SbtA has a high affinity but low flux rate. Our laboratory competition experiments show that bicA + sbtA genotypes were favored by natural selection at low CO2 levels, but were partially replaced by the bicA genotype at elevated CO2. Similarly, in a eutrophic lake, bicA + sbtA strains were dominant when C-i concentrations were depleted during a dense cyanobacterial bloom, but were replaced by strains with only the high-flux bicA gene when C-i concentrations increased later in the season. Hence, our results provide both laboratory and field evidence that increasing carbon concentrations induce rapid adaptive changes in the genotype composition of harmful cyanobacterial blooms.

Intensive allochthonous inputs along the Ganges River and their effect on microbial community composition and dynamics	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Little is known about microbial communities in the Ganges River, India and how they respond to intensive anthropogenic inputs. Here we applied shotgun metagenomics sequencing to study microbial community dynamics and function in planktonic samples collected along an approximately 700 km river transect, including urban cities and rural settings in upstream waters, before and after the monsoon rainy season. Our results showed that 11%-32% of the microbes represented terrestrial, sewage and human inputs (allochthonous). Sewage inputs significantly contributed to the higher abundance, by 13-fold of human gut microbiome (HG) associated sequences and 2-fold of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the Ganges relative to other riverine ecosystems in Europe, North and South America. Metagenome-assembled genome sequences (MAGs) representing allochthonous populations were detectable and tractable across the river after 1-2 days of (downstream) transport (> 200 km apart). Only approximately 8% of these MAGs were abundant in U.S. freshwater ecosystems, revealing distinct biodiversity for the Ganges. Microbial communities in the rainy season exhibited increased alpha-diversity and spatial heterogeneity and showed significantly weaker distance-decay patterns compared with the dry season. These results advance our understanding of the Ganges microbial communities and how they respond to anthropogenic pollution.					; Hatt, Janet/HME-2512-2023; Konstantinidis, Kostas/ABE-7113-2020; Tripathi, Sachchida/J-4840-2016; Bivins, Aaron/AAQ-5894-2020; Brown, Joe/ABF-8201-2020	Konstantinidis, Konstantinos/0000-0002-0954-4755; Hatt, Janet/0000-0002-5666-0994; Bivins, Aaron/0000-0001-9385-2138; Tsementzi, Despina/0000-0002-4578-1918													1462-2912	1462-2920				JAN	2019	21	1					182	196		10.1111/1462-2920.14439	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.14439								30325092					WOS:000456278900013

These trends emphasize the need of accurate medium- to long-term predictions to timely prompt anticipatory operations. Despite in some locations global climate oscillations and particularly the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) may contribute to extending forecast lead times, in other regions there is no consensus on how ENSO can be detected, and used as local conditions are also influenced by other concurrent climate signals. In this work, we introduce the Climate State Intelligence framework to capture the state of multiple global climate signals via artificial intelligence and improve seasonal forecasts. These forecasts are used as additional inputs for informing water system operations and their value is quantified as the corresponding gain in system performance. We apply the framework to the Lake Como basin, a regulated lake in northern Italy mainly operated for flood control and irrigation supply. Numerical results show the existence of notable teleconnection patterns dependent on both ENSO and the North Atlantic Oscillation over the Alpine region, which contribute in generating skilful seasonal precipitation and hydrologic forecasts. The use of this information for conditioning the lake operations produces an average 44% improvement in system performance with respect to a baseline solution not informed by any forecast, with this gain that further increases during extreme drought episodes. Our results also suggest that observed preseason sea surface temperature anomalies appear more valuable than hydrologic-based seasonal forecasts, producing an average 59% improvement in system performance.					; ZANIOLO, MARTA/ITT-8162-2023; Castelletti, Andrea/AAG-7111-2020	Davoli, Guido/0000-0002-7680-8319; Block, Paul/0000-0003-1993-7496; Castelletti, Andrea/0000-0002-7923-1498; ZANIOLO, MARTA/0000-0001-9466-7102; Giuliani, Matteo/0000-0002-4780-9347; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				NOV	2019	55	11					9133	9147		10.1029/2019WR025035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019WR025035		NOV 2019											WOS:000496649400001

Revisiting Odum (1956): A synthesis of aquatic ecosystem metabolism	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												H. T. Odum's influential Limnology and Oceanography 1956 publication compared gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) among aquatic ecosystems. Few syntheses of aquatic ecosystem metabolism have been completed since. We used Odum's conceptual framework to compare GPP and ER from open-water diel oxygen curves in lakes, wetlands, estuaries, and streams (n = 350). We also documented environmental drivers of metabolism among ecosystems. GPP and ER were strongly related in lakes and estuaries, but weakly related in streams and wetlands. GPP and ER were highest in estuaries, and GPP : ER was lowest in streams. Differences in the magnitude and variability of metabolism among ecosystems were attributable to landscape and water-column factors. Watershed size and phosphorus (P) concentrations were positively related to GPP and ER across all ecosystems. Considered independently, lake and estuary GPP were driven by P concentrations. In contrast, land-use and canopy cover drove stream metabolism, not nutrient concentrations. Results confirmed the classic paradigm that estuaries are the most productive aquatic ecosystem; however, our synthesis showed that relative to streams and estuaries, there was higher variation in lake GPP and ER than previously documented. Results will be valuable for management, restoration, and carbon budgets, which incorporate metabolism measurements at both the catchment and landscape scales. As metabolism datasets grow, future syntheses will address challenges including seasonality, sensor deployment time and location, hydrology, and variation in analytical conventions by discipline. Ongoing technological and computational advancements, combined with increased communication among subdisciplines, should also expand insights generated by subsequent metabolism syntheses.

J	González, RM; Cánovas, CR; Olías, M; Macías, F				Moreno Gonzalez, Raul; Ruiz Canovas, Carlos; Olias, Manuel; Macias, Francisco			Seasonal variability of extremely metal rich acid mine drainages from the Tharsis mines (SW Spain)	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												The Tharsis mine is presently abandoned, but the past intense exploitation has left large dumps and other sulphide-rich mining wastes in the area generating acid mine drainages (AMD). The main goal of this work is to study the effect of hydrogeochemical processes, hydrological regime and the waste typology on the physicochemical parameters and dissolved concentrations of pollutants in a deeply AMD-affected zone. Extreme leachates are produced in the area, reaching even negative pH and concentrations of up to 2.2 g/L of As and 194 g/L of Fe. The results of the comparison of ore grades of sulphide deposits with dissolved concentrations in waters shows that Pb is the least mobile element in dissolution probably due to the precipitation of Pb secondary minerals and/or its coprecipitation on Fe oxyhydroxysulphates. Arsenic, Cr, and V are also coprecipitated with Fe minerals. Seasonal patterns in metal contents were identified: elements coming from the host rocks, such as Al, Mn and Ni, show their maximum values in the dry period, when dilution with freshwater is lower and the interaction of waterrock processes and evaporation is higher. On the other hand, As, Cr, Fe, Pb and V show minimum concentrations in the dry period due to intense Fe oxyhydroxysulphate precipitation. In this sense, large sulphide rich waste heaps would be a temporal sink of these elements (i.e. Pb, As, Cr and V) in the dry period, and a significant source upon intense rainfalls.

Hence, we investigated the seasonal variation of dominant MCs (MC-LR, MC-RR and MC-YR) in sediments of Lake Taihu over four seasons for the first time. Sediment MCs varied seasonally (p < 0.01) with concentrations highest in August and lowest in February. The MCs were dominated by MC-LR (61.47%) with the content ranging from 0.02 to 2.37 mu g/g dry weight in sediment. The three MC congeners and their proportions were significantly correlated with latitude and longitude. Meiliang Bay in the north had the highest MCs of all sites, while the eastern part of the lake had a high level especially in August. Variation of MC-LR and MC-RR concentrations was significantly correlated (p < 0.05) with water temperature, dissolved total organic carbon, cyanobacteria density, total suspended solid particles, and total organic carbon and total nitrogen in sediment, while MC-YR was negatively correlated (p < 0.01) with nutrients in the water column and heavy metals in sediments. An ecological risk assessment suggested the MCs already pose significant adverse effects on Potamopyrgus antipodarum; although the adverse effects on humans were weak, children were at greater risk than adults.

Fish Acquisition and Consumption in the African Great Lakes Region through a Food Environment Lens: A Scoping Review	NUTRIENTS												Effective actions for the fishery and aquaculture sectors to contribute toward improving nutrition rely on an understanding of the factors influencing fish intake, particularly amongst vulnerable populations. This scoping review synthesises evidence from 33 studies in the African Great Lakes Region to examine the influence of food environments on fish acquisition and consumption. We identified only two studies that explicitly applied a food environment framework and none that linked policy conditions with the contribution of fish to diets. Economic access to fish was represented in the largest number of included studies (21 studies), followed by preferences, acceptability and desirability of fish (17 studies) and availability and physical access (14 studies). Positive perceptions of taste and low cost, relative to other animal-source foods, were drivers of fish purchases in many settings; however, limited physical and economic access were frequently identified as preventing optimal intake. In lakeside communities, fish were increasingly directed toward external markets which reduced the availability and affordability of fish for local households. Few studies considered intra-household variations in fish access according to age, gender or physiological status, which represents an important knowledge gap. There is also scope for future research on seasonal influences on fish access and the design and rigorous evaluation of programmes and policies that address one or more constraints of availability, cost, convenience and preferences.

In this study, several regression methods and physicals models based on hyperspectral satellite data and field observations are proposed to monitor critical water quality parameters, including water turbidity (WT), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and total organic carbon (TOC) in alpine rivers. Three remote sensing and field joint observation experiments were firstly carried out in these rivers in different seasons. Then, novel statistical and semi-analytical models were built to calculate the water quality parameters in these alpine rivers using hyperspectral remote sensing data. An integrated air-ground database containing long-term water quality parameters of alpine rivers was further generated to capture the spatial heterogeneity of the water environment of these rivers by using the novel models. The results indicate that WT, TP, TN, and TOC concentrations showed clear interannual cyclical variations and seasonal variations, which reflect that the water environment has a strong seasonality and are mainly controlled by climate change in the alpine plateau.					; Zhang, Jingting/GZB-1769-2022; Ma, Yuanxu/L-1057-2013	Zhang, Jingting/0000-0001-5041-3629; 													1548-1603	1943-7226				DEC 31	2022	59	1					1384	1405		10.1080/15481603.2022.2116078	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2022.2116078													WOS:000848871700001
J	Yao, LM; Xu, ZW; Chen, XD				Yao, Liming; Xu, Zhongwen; Chen, Xudong			Sustainable water allocation strategies under various climate scenarios: A case study in China	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Increasing water demand aggravates water scarcity in water-scarce regions (e.g., India, Pakistan, and China), where uneven precipitation increases the risk of maintaining sustainable eco-economic development. Ignoring precipitation's effects leads to misguided policy recommendations that either deplete or underuse basin water resources. Therefore, this paper highlights the concept of uneven precipitation and uncertain stream inflow based on scenario analysis. Within a river basin, the regional authority and subarea managers both have water allocation and reallocation privileges. Motivated by sustainable development of water resource management systems, we argue that regional authorities should focus on alleviating the contradiction between supply and demand, and then seeking an optimum allocation strategy to ensure societal and economic benefits for its subareas, from which the subareas cart provide reasonable reaction strategies. Authorities dominate water transactions between subareas involved in water rights distribution. This paper proposes a multi-objective multistage Stackelberg-Nash-Cournot (m(2)SNC) game model to cope with conflicts between regional authorities and subarea managers concerning multiple activities. An interactive-dynamic-programming-based genetic algorithm (IDP-GA) is designed to simulate the policies needed for the optimum allocation of water resources under various climate scenarios. The significant stress caused by unsustainable water resource allocation has been a perplexing problem for Sancha Lake, an important area in the southeast basin of the Dujiangyan Irrigation System in China. To identify the tradeoffs among stakeholders, we apply the proposed model to this basin. To gain further insight into climate change and water usage sustainability, we simulate the varying spatial and seasonal distribution of stream inflow based on historical climate data and propose different water management strategies for normal, slight drought, moderate drought, and serious drought conditions. This creates an emergency response cooperative mechanism based on different climate scenarios for developing countries that need to cope with water deficiency and uncertain situations.

We used reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), metabolomics, and toxin profiling (both by LC-MS) to measure the response of Microcystis aeruginosa NIES-843 to nitrogen (N) concentration, N chemistry (nitrate versus urea), and a range of seasonally relevant temperatures. Growth rates at lower temperatures were slower but resulted in increased cellular microcystin content (quota), and at these lower temperatures, N concentration had no effect on toxin production. In contrast, at warmer temperatures, reduction in N concentration increased toxin production, especially when urea was supplied as the nitrogen source. Our culture results demonstrate how temperature may lead to physiological responses ranging from slow growing yet very toxic cells at cool temperatures, to faster growing but less-toxic cells at warmer temperatures. This response represents a key interaction in bloom dynamics. Capturing this phenomenon as a temperature-driven toxin phenotype incorporated into models might improve the ability to predict microcystin biosynthesis during cyanobacterial blooms.					; Wilhelm, Steven/B-8963-2008; Lin, Sijie/E-7719-2011; Lin, Sijie/S-8428-2016; Peng, Guotao/P-2016-2018	Martin, Robbie/0000-0001-5284-7156; Wilhelm, Steven/0000-0001-6283-8077; Lin, Sijie/0000-0002-6970-8221; Boyer, Gregory/0000-0003-4490-5461; Peng, Guotao/0000-0001-7169-9961													0013-936X	1520-5851				APR 3	2018	52	7					4127	4136		10.1021/acs.est.7b06532	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b06532								29522323					WOS:000429385700033
J	Arfa, A; Minaei, M				Arfa, Atefe; Minaei, Masoud			Utilizing multitemporal indices and spectral bands of Sentinel-2 to enhance land use and land cover classification with random forest and support vector machine	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH												Multitemporal imagery offers a critical advantage by capturing seasonal variations, which are essential for differentiating between land use and land cover (LULC) types. While these types may appear similar when examined at one specific time, they exhibit distinct phenological patterns across different seasons. This temporal depth is crucial for enhancing model accuracy, particularly in heterogeneous landscapes where LULC transitions are frequent and complex. This paper made use of spectral bands and indices of Sentinel2 from April to September 2020 for LULC classification using two advanced machine learning models: Random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). The spectral indices include the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and modified normalized water index (MNDWI). The dataset was divided into four temporal feature sets: April-May, June-July, August-September, and the entire period from April-September. For each two-month period, the median values of the spectral bands and indices were used. Both models were evaluated based on overall accuracy, F1-score, Kappa coefficient, precision, and recall. Results indicate that incorporating multitemporal features enhanced the performance of the chosen models, with overall accuracy increasing from 82.4% to 94.03% for RF and from 75.4% to 93.54% for SVM. Additionally, the RF algorithm demonstrated higher accuracy than the SVM model across various time periods, with notable improvements in other performance metrics. These improvements also underscore the ability of the models to leverage the rich multitemporal data provided by Sentinel-2 for accurate LULC classification.

However, there is a limited understanding of the impact of biochar and clay on nutrient retention under field conditions, especially in seasonally dry tropical forests in semi-arid regions. In this study, biochar and clay were added to a tropical Arenosol to quantify nutrient leaching as a measure of nutrient retention to test the potential of both amendments for soil amelioration. In a field experiment, planting holes were prepared with 5 vol% medium-temperature biochar made of Prosopis juliflora (SW) DC, produced locally in the traditional manner in a kiln, or 10 vol% clayey sediment from a temporarily dry lake. Both amendments and control were tested as fertilised and unfertilised treatments. Then seedlings of the endemic tree Spondias tuberosa Arr. were planted. Self -integrating accumulators (SIAs) were used to quantify nutrient leaching at a depth of 0.7 m for ammonium -N (NH4+ - N), nitrate -N (NO3- - N), and potassium (K+). Leaching was assessed for two consecutive periods of eight months each. In the fertilised treatments, biochar addition significantly reduced NO3- - N leaching by 46% in the first period; leaching of all other nutrients was reduced but remained non-significant. In contrast, clay addition significantly reduced NH4+ - N leaching by 790/a in the second period, K+ leaching by 51% in the first period, and by 45% in the second period, but significantly increased NO3- - N leaching by 57% in the second period. Both treatments showed pronouncedly different leaching patterns over time. Between the first and second period, the ability of biochar to reduce leaching relative to the control decreased by about half for the nutrients tested, whereas the ability of the clay treatment remained rather stable over 1.5 years for NH4+ - N and K+. The reason for the distinct decrease in nutrient retention of biochar in the second period may be the rapid decomposition of biochar carbon by 51% within 16 months. Under the given conditions, only clay can be recommended as a sustainable land management strategy to enhance NH4+ - N and K+ retention capacity of Arenosols in seasonally dry tropical forests.

J	Batina, A; Krtalic, A				Batina, Anja; Krtalic, Andrija			Integrating Remote Sensing Methods for Monitoring Lake Water Quality: A Comprehensive Review	HYDROLOGY												Remote sensing methods have the potential to improve lake water quality monitoring and decision-making in water management. This review discusses the use of remote sensing methods for monitoring and assessing water quality in lakes. It explains the principles of remote sensing and the different methods used for retrieving water quality parameters in complex waterbodies. The review highlights the importance of considering the variability of optically active parameters and the need for comprehensive studies that encompass different seasons and time frames. The paper addresses the specific physical and biological parameters that can be effectively estimated using remote sensing, such as chlorophyll-alpha, turbidity, water transparency (Secchi disk depth), electrical conductivity, surface salinity, and water temperature. It further provides a comprehensive summary of the bands, band combinations, and band equations commonly used for remote sensing of these parameters per satellite sensor. It also discusses the limitations of remote sensing methods and the challenges associated with satellite systems. The review recommends integrating remote sensing methods using in situ measurements and computer modelling to improve the understanding of water quality. It suggests future research directions, including the importance of optimizing grid selection and time frame for in situ measurements by combining hydrodynamic models with remote sensing retrieval methods, considering variability in water quality parameters when analysing satellite imagery, the development of advanced technologies, and the integration of machine learning algorithms for effective water quality problem-solving. The review concludes with a proposed workflow for monitoring and assessing water quality parameters in lakes using remote sensing methods.

J	Correa, SB; Winemiller, K				Correa, Sandra Bibiana; Winemiller, Kirk			Terrestrial-aquatic trophic linkages support fish production in a tropical oligotrophic river	OECOLOGIA												Despite low in situ primary productivity, tropical oligotrophic rivers support highly diverse fish assemblages and productive fisheries. This raises the question, what energy sources support fish production in these ecosystems? We sampled fish and food resources in the floodplain of a nearly pristine, large, oligotrophic river in western Amazonia. We combined data from stomach contents and stable isotopes to test the hypothesis that floodplain forests sustain fisheries in tropical oligotrophic rivers. Analysis of stomach contents from > 800 specimens of 12 omnivorous fish species demonstrated that during the annual flood, forest plant matter dominated diets. Yet, our isotope mixing models estimated that arthropods from the forest canopy made a greater proportional contribution to fish biomass. Most of these arthropods are entirely terrestrial and, therefore, serve as trophic links between forests and fishes. Our results suggest that forest vegetation, particularly fruits, may provide much of the energy supporting metabolism and arthropods contribute significant amounts of protein for somatic growth. Moreover, the importance of terrestrial arthropods in support of fish biomass in oligotrophic rivers depends on interactions between riparian vegetation, terrestrial arthropods and flood pulse dynamics affecting accessibility of arthropods to fishes. The apparent paradox of high fish diversity in an oligotrophic river with low primary productivity may be explained, at least partially, by dynamic terrestrial-aquatic trophic linkages. This study further emphasizes the importance of seasonally flooded forests for sustaining fisheries in the Amazon.

Minor contribution of small thaw ponds to the pools of carbon and methane in the inland waters of the permafrost-affected part of the Western Siberian Lowland	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Despite the potential importance of small (< 1000 m(2)) thaw ponds and thermokarst lakes in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from inland waters of high latitude and boreal regions, these features have not been fully inventoried and the volume of GHG and carbon in thermokarst lakes remains poorly constrained. This is especially true for the vast Western Siberia Lowland (WSL) which is subject to strong thermokarst activity. We assessed the number of thermokarst lakes and their size distribution for the permafrost-affected WSL territory based on a combination of medium-resolution Landsat-8 images and high-resolution Kanopus-V scenes on 78 test sites across the WSL in a wide range of lake sizes (from 20 to 2 x 10(8) m(2)). The results were in fair agreement with other published data for world lakes including those in circum-polar regions. Based on available measurements of CH4, CO2, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in thermokarst lakes and thaw ponds of the permafrost-affected part of the WSL, we found an inverse relationship between lake size and concentration, with concentrations of GHGs and DOC being highest in small thaw ponds. However, since these small ponds represent only a tiny fraction of the landscape (i.e. similar to 1.5% of the total lake area), their contribution to the total pool of GHG and DOC in inland lentic water of the permafrost-affected part of the WSL is less than 2%. As such, despite high concentrations of DOC and GHG in small ponds, their role in overall C storage can be negated. Ongoing lake drainage due to climate warming and permafrost thaw in the WSL may lead to a decrease in GHG emission potential from inland waters and DOC release from lakes to rivers.

We proposed a regional linear corrected SDD estimation model based on the North Sea Mathematical Models for GOCI and the mechanical model developed by Lee et al. (2015) in the Jiaozhou Bay. Combined with the multiple variable linear regression analysis, the diurnal SDD variations of the bay inside and the bay mouth are controlled by the solar zenith angle (SZA) and tides. The bay outside mainly varies with SZA. From GOCI observations between 2011 and 2021, wind force influenced the entire area on the inner-annual SDD variations. It exhibits an increasing trend in the inter-annual dynamics, which was more stable inside the bay with an annual increase of 0.035 m, and air temperature was the most significant contribution. However, human activities cannot be ignored in causing water environment changes.

J	Adams, JB; Van Niekerk, L				Adams, Janine Barbara; Van Niekerk, Lara			Ten Principles to Determine Environmental Flow Requirements for Temporarily Closed Estuaries	WATER												Temporarily closed estuaries require seasonal opening to tidal flows to maintain normal ecological processes. Each estuary has specific environmental flow (EFlow) requirements based on the relationship between freshwater inflow, coastal dynamics, rate of sandbar formation, and the open/closed state of the mouth. Key abiotic processes and ecosystem services linked to mouth state were highlighted. We reviewed completed EFlow requirement studies for temporarily closed estuaries in South Africa and found that the formulation of these requirements should consider the timing and magnitude of flows in relation to the morphology of an estuary, its mouth structure, catchment size, and climate. We identified ten key principles that could be adapted to similar systems in equivalent climatic settings. Principle 1 recognizes that each estuary is unique in terms of its EFlow requirements because size, scale, and sensitivity of core elements to freshwater inflow are specific for each system; EFlows cannot be extrapolated from one estuary to another. Principle 2 highlights the importance of baseflows in keeping an estuary mouth open because a small reduction in flow can cause the mouth to close and alter essential ecological processes. Principle 3 outlines the role of floods in resetting natural processes by flushing out large volumes of sediment and establishing the equilibrium between erosion and sedimentation. Principle 4 emphasizes the need for open mouth conditions to allow regular tidal flushing that maintains water quality through reducing retention times and preventing the onset of eutrophic conditions. Principle 5 advises artificial breaching to be practiced with caution because execution at low water levels encourages sedimentation that reduces the scouring effect of flushing. Principle 6 holds that elevated inflow volumes from wastewater treatment works or agricultural return flows can increase the frequency of mouth opening and cause ecological instability. Principle 7 states that water released from dams to supply the environmental flow cannot mimic the natural flow regime. Principle 8 specifies the need for short- and long-term data to increase the confidence levels of EFlow assessments, with data to be collected during the open and closed mouth states. Principle 9 advocates the implementation of a monitoring program to track the achievement of EFlow objectives as part of a strategic adaptive management cycle. Finally, Principle 10 recommends the adoption of a holistic catchment-to-coast management approach underpinned by collaboration with regulatory authorities and stakeholders across a range of sectors. These principles can be used to guide the formulation and management of EFlows, an essential strategy that links the maintenance of estuarine ecological integrity with social well-being.					; Adams, Janine/AAA-9865-2021; van Niekerk, Lara/AAG-8064-2021	Van Niekerk, Lara/0000-0001-5761-1337; Adams, Janine/0000-0001-7204-123X; 														2073-4441				JUL	2020	12	7							1944	10.3390/w12071944	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12071944													WOS:000556911400001

With pending removal and reconstruction of aging reservoirs and planning of new reservoirs in this area, it is advisable to evaluate the likely impact of the existing and alternative reservoir network layouts on the hydrologic regime for more effective water resources planning and management. In this study, reservoirs of multiple sizes in the PLB were integrated into a coupled land surface-hydrologic model (CLHMS) fully coupled with a reservoir scheme. The extended model was then validated and applied to investigate the impact of existing reservoirs. Seven hypothetical scenarios were additionally set up by removing all the reservoirs, replacing smaller reservoirs with few larger ones, replacing larger reservoirs with many smaller ones, moving all reservoirs downstream or upstream, increasing or decreasing the mean inflow of reservoirs, respectively. In all, eight simulations were conducted and analyzed using the Indictors of Hydrologic Alterations (IHA) for the period of 1981-1999. Results indicate that the existing reservoirs in the PLB are able to effectively displace the excessive streamflow in the wet season to the dry season and mitigate the hydrological extremes. By increasing the mean inflow of reservoirs, the effectiveness of reservoirs in downstream flow regulation can be further enhanced. Similarly, replacing many small reservoirs with a few large ones with a same total capacity can lead to more resiliency against the downstream flow variability and extremes, only if the total mean inflow of the new large reservoirs is not considerably lower than that of the small ones. Relocating reservoirs to a different place with similar mean inflow, however, has a relatively minor and probably case-dependent impact on the hydrologic regime. On the other hand, the ecological analysis on the IHA parameters indicates that the layout preferable for the effective flow regulation may not necessarily be ecologically preferable. In general, this study comprehensively evaluates the hydrological impact of reservoir network layouts, and can provide implications for stakeholders to reach a trade-off between reservoir capacity distribution, locations and mean inflow not only in the PLB but also in different regions worldwide.

Several abiotic and biotic factors at the water-sediment interface are known to influence the role of sediments as temporary nutrient sources. This study aimed at quantifying the effects of two factors (i.e., oxygenation and bioturbation) on fluxes of nutrients from the water-sediment interface of the reservoir. An experimental approach was developed in the laboratory to test three fauna conditions (no fauna, presence of tubificid worms, and chironomids larvae) and three conditions of water column oxygenation (aerobic, fluctuating, and anaerobic conditions). Chironomid larvae significantly increased concentrations of N (NH4+ + NO3-) and PO43- released from sediments by 3.7-fold and by 17-fold, whereas tubificid worms had a lesser effect (twofold for N and threefold for PO43-). Anaerobic conditions increased N by 56-fold and PO43- by 102-fold compared to the aerobic treatment. Thus, anaerobic conditions produced greater N and P fluxes than fauna. Nevertheless, fauna and anoxic conditions at the water-sediment interface should not be neglected when quantifying the role of sediments on nutrient dynamics in lakes and reservoirs.					; Mermillod-Blondin, Florian/AAF-3491-2020	Nogaro, Geraldine/0000-0003-0292-4074; Volatier, Laurence/0000-0002-9491-9733; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2020	847	4					1027	1040		10.1007/s10750-019-04166-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-019-04166-0													WOS:000512772400004

Determination of water colour, as perceived by the human eye, does not require knowledge of inherent optical properties and therefore represents a generally applicable remotely-sensed water quality attribute. In this paper, we implemented a recent algorithm for the retrieval of colour parameters (hue angle, dominant wavelength) and derived a new correction for colour purity to account for the spectral bandpass of the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). We used this algorithm to calculate water colour on almost 45,000 observations over four years from 1486 lakes from a diverse range of optical water types in New Zealand. We show that the most prevalent lake colours are yellow-orange and blue, respectively, while green observations are comparatively rare. About 40% of the study lakes show transitions between colours at a range of time scales, including seasonal. A preliminary exploratory analysis suggests that both geo-physical and anthropogenic factors, such as catchment land use, provide environmental control of lake colour and are promising avenues for future analysis.					van der Woerd, Hans/K-9812-2013; Van der Woerd, Hendrik Jan/K-9812-2013; Nguyen, Uyen/F-5282-2018	Allan, Mathew/0000-0002-8852-9085; Van der Woerd, Hendrik Jan/0000-0002-8901-7567; Nguyen, Uyen/0000-0001-9713-829X; Lehmann, Moritz/0000-0001-7346-3901														2072-4292				AUG	2018	10	8							1273	10.3390/rs10081273	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs10081273													WOS:000443618100109

Remote sensing and in situ-based assessment of rapidly growing South Lhonak glacial lake in eastern Himalaya, India	NATURAL HAZARDS												Melting glaciers are mostly associated with formation of proglacial lakes and the expansion of existing glacial lakes in Himalayan region. These expanding glacial lakes can induce the risk of glacial outburst floods that pose a great potential threat to natural resources and human lives. In Sikkim Himalaya, South Lhonak lake (SLL) (5200 masl) is rapidly expanding over the few decades due to the ongoing glacier melting. We recorded that the lake size increased from 0.20 +/- 0.020 to 1.31 +/- 0.001 km(2) with the length change of 1.6 km during the period from 1976 to 2016. The average rate of expansion was recorded of 0.027 km(2) per year; however, it increased drastically since 2000. The in situ-based bathymetric study of SLL showed that the storage volume was 65.81 +/- 2.5 million m(3) and maximum and average depths were 131 +/- 2.5 and 67.05 +/- 2.5 m, respectively. We observed that the substantial calving of ice bodies during the melting seasons and partly from the melting of North Lhonak glacier and flow of the Lhonak lake have contributed in expansion of SLL. We have also proposed an empirical equation of volume-area relationship to calculate the storage capacity of similar moraine-dammed glacial lakes in the Himalaya. In addition, we have suggested effective precautionary and mitigation measures to minimize the risk of GLOFs in future. The present study provides vital inputs for hydrodynamic modelling for flood simulation of potentially vulnerable lakes and to formulate the effective strategies in disaster risk reduction and mitigation plan in minimizing the threat of GLOFs.					; Sharma, Radha/AAF-6007-2020	Sharma, Dr. R.

The annual wet deposition rates of total N (TN), ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-), dissolved organic N (DON), water-insoluble particulate N (WIPN), and sulfate (SO42-) were 16.87-26.64, 6.38-10.81, 5.92-11.11, 1.43-1.96, 2.23-2.67, and 9.07-22.53 kg N (S) ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The wet N and S deposition rates were in the order: agriculture > urban > lake sites, and the seasonal variations in wet N and S deposition were similar at all sites. DON and WIPN contributed 6.4-11.8% and 10.7-16.2% of the total wet N deposition, respectively. Chemical N fertilization and fossil fuel were important sources of wet N and S deposition. Annual wet N and S deposition are important nutrient sources that stimulate the eutrophication and soil/water acidification in the YRD. To minimize the environmental cost of wet N and S deposition in the YRD, it is critical to investigate the sources of N and S.

The challenge in producing estimates of freshwater discharge for the HBDB is that it spans over a third of Canada's continental landmass and is 40% ungauged. Scenarios for BaySys require the separation between human and climate interactions, specifically the separation of regulated river discharge from a natural, climate-driven response. We present three key improvements to the modelling system required to support the identification of natural from anthropogenic impacts: representation of prairie disconnected landscapes (i.e., non-contributing areas), a method to generalize lake storage-discharge parameters across large regions, and frozen soil modifications. Additionally, a unique approach to account for irregular hydrometric gauge density across the basins during model calibration is presented that avoids overfitting parameters to the densely gauged southern regions. We summarize our methodologies used to facilitate improved separation of human and climate driven impacts to streamflow within the basin and outline the baseline discharge simulations used for the BaySys group of projects. Challenges remain for modeling the most northern reaches of the basin, and in the lake-dominated watersheds. The techniques presented in this work, particularly the lake and flow signature clusters, may be applied to other high latitude, ungauged Arctic basins. Discharge simulations are subsequently used as input data for oceanographic, biogeochemical, and ecosystem studies across the HBDB.

Synergistic Effects of Temperature and Salinity on the Gene Expression and Physiology of Crassostrea virginica	INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY					Symposium on Stress Phenotype - Linking Molecular, Cellular, and Physiological Stress Responses to Fitness at the Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Integrative-and-Comparative-Biology	JAN 03-07, 2019	Tampa, FL	Soc Integrat & Comparat Biol				The eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, forms reefs that provide critical services to the surrounding ecosystem. These reefs are at risk from climate change, in part because altered rainfall patterns may amplify local fluctuations in salinity, impacting oyster recruitment, survival, and growth. As in other marine organisms, warming water temperatures might interact with these changes in salinity to synergistically influence oyster physiology. In this study, we used comparative transcriptomics, measurements of physiology, and a field assessment to investigate what phenotypic changes C. virginica uses to cope with combined temperature and salinity stress in the Gulf of Mexico. Oysters from a historically low salinity site (Sister Lake, LA) were exposed to fully crossed temperature (20 degrees C and 30 degrees C) and salinity (25, 15, and 7 PSU) treatments. Using comparative transcriptomics on oyster gill tissue, we identified a greater number of genes that were differentially expressed (DE) in response to low salinity at warmer temperatures. Functional enrichment analysis showed low overlap between genes DE in response to thermal stress compared with hypoosmotic stress and identified enrichment for gene ontologies associated with cell adhesion, transmembrane transport, and microtubule-based process. Experiments also showed that oysters changed their physiology at elevated temperatures and lowered salinity, with significantly increased respiration rates between 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C. However, despite the higher energetic demands, oysters did not increase their feeding rate. To investigate transcriptional differences between populations in situ, we collected gill tissue from three locations and two time points across the Louisiana Gulf coast and used quantitative PCR to measure the expression levels of seven target genes. We found an upregulation of genes that function in osmolyte transport, oxidative stress mediation, apoptosis, and protein synthesis at our low salinity site and sampling time point. In summary, oysters altered their phenotype more in response to low salinity at higher temperatures as evidenced by a higher number of DE genes during laboratory exposure, increased respiration (higher energetic demands), and in situ differential expression by season and location. These synergistic effects of hypoosmotic stress and increased temperature suggest that climate change will exacerbate the negative effects of low salinity exposure on eastern oysters.

Time-series analysis of Landsat-MSS/TM/OLI images over Amazonian waters impacted by gold mining activities	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Water siltation caused by artisanal gold mining has impacted the Tapajos River Basin in Brazil for the past 40 years, however spatial-temporal information about changes in water quality and consequences to the aquatic environment is lacking. To address this, the Landsat satellite family sensors were used to retrieve total suspended solids (TSS) of the water of the Tapajos River from 1973 to 2013. An image processing approach that includes atmospheric correction, based on the 6S model, and glint removing, based on shortwave infrared correction, was applied and validated with in situ radiometric data. An optimization of the atmospheric correction having dark dense forest spectra as reference was applied and allowed a robust correction of MSS, TM and OLI signal to surface reflectance values. Sediment concentration was estimated based on a non-linear empirical regression between measured TSS and satellite surface reflectance at red band. The multi-temporal analysis of TSS showed that the sediment load in the Tapajos aquatic system is in synchrony with mining activities, and a constant seasonal variation of water siltation is observed throughout the time frame of this study. At the end of the rainy season, mining activities intensify and, coupled with low water flow, TSS increases. During the high water level, TSS concentrations were consistently lower because of high water dilution and low mining activity. In a decadal analysis, a peak of sediment concentration coincides with a peak of gold production in all sites analyzed during early 1990s. More recently, due to the currently gold rush, an increase in suspended solids has been observed mainly in the Novo and Tocantins rivers where industrial mining has been installed.

Strong continentality and effective moisture drove unforeseen vegetation dynamics since the last interglacial at inland Mediterranean areas: The Villarquemado sequence in NE Iberia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Few continental palaeoenvironmental sedimentary sequences from Southern Europe are long enough to span the last interglacial period (Marine Isotopic Stage-MIS 5), the last glacial cycle (MIS 4 to 2) and the Holocene. El Canizar de Villarquemado (North-Eastern Iberian Peninsula) is an exceptional sedimentary lacustrine sequence spanning the last ca. 135,000 years of environmental change in an area of inland Iberia characterized by Mediterranean climate with strong continentality. We present a multiproxy study which combines palynological, sedimentological and geochemical analyses framed by an independent, robust chronology. Hydrological and climate evolutions were reconstructed by sedimentological and geochemical proxies. Development of wetlands and shallow carbonate lakes support relatively humid conditions during MIS 6, till the onset of MIS 4, and during the Holocene. Palaeohydrological conditions were drier during MIS 5 (dominance of peat environments) than during the Holocene (more frequent carbonate-producing lakes). Sedimentological evidence indicates extremely arid conditions during MIS 3 with greater activity of alluvial fans prograding into the basin. Sedimentary facies variability highlights a large environmental and hydrological variability during MIS 2 and a rapid humidity response to the onset of the Holocene. Compared to classic Mediterranean sites, we found novel pollen assemblages for the end of MIS 6 and MIS 5 indicating that the vegetation cover was essentially represented by sustained high proportions of continentality-adapted taxa dominated by Juniperus during the relatively humid conditions since MIS 6 till the onset of MIS 4. Higher evapotranspiration in inland Iberia would have increased during periods of higher seasonal insolation maxima, impeding soil development and the usual mesophyte expansion during interglacials observed in other Mediterranean areas. Four main periods of forest development occurred in Villarquemado during MIS 5e, MIS 5c, MIS 5a and the Holocene; secondary peaks occurred also during MIS 3. During colder but still relatively humid MIS 4, junipers and Mediterranean taxa disappear but some mesophytes and cold-tolerant species persisted and Pinus became the dominant tree up to modern times. Pollen assemblages and geochemical data variability suggest a dominant control of seasonality and the impact of North Atlantic dynamics both during MIS 5 (cold events C18-C24) and full glacial conditions (HE and D-O interstadials). At millennial scales, steppe herbaceous assemblages dominated during the extremely arid conditions of MIS 3 and pines and steppe taxa during glacial period MIS 2. Villarquemado sequence demonstrates that the resilient behaviour of conifers in continental areas of inland Southern European regions is key to understand the glacial-interglacial vegetation evolution and to evaluate scenarios for potential impacts of global change.

Long-Term Phosphorus Loading and Springtime Temperatures Explain Interannual Variability of Hypoxia in a Large Temperate Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Anthropogenic eutrophication has led to the increased occurrence of hypoxia in inland and coastal waters around the globe. While low dissolved oxygen conditions are known to be driven primarily by nutrient loading and water column stratification, the relative importance of these factors and their associated time scales are not well understood. Here, we explore these questions for Lake Erie, a large temperate lake that experiences widespread annual summertime hypoxia. We leverage a three-decade data set of summertime hypoxic extent (1985-2015) and examine the role of seasonal and long-term nutrient loading, as well as hydrometeorological conditions. We find that a linear combination of decadal total phosphorus loading from tributaries and springtime air temperatures explains a high proportion of the interannual variability in average summertime hypoxic extent (R-2 = 0.71). This result suggests that the lake responds primarily to long-term variations in phosphorus inputs, rather than springtime or annual loading as previously assumed, which is consistent with internal phosphorus loading from lake sediments likely being an important contributing mechanism. This result also demonstrates that springtime temperatures have a substantial impact on summertime hypoxia, likely by impacting the timing of onset of thermal stratification. These findings imply that management strategies based on reducing tributary phosphorus loading would take several years to reap full benefits, and that projected future increases in temperatures are likely to exacerbate hypoxia in Lake Erie and other temperate lakes.

In this study, changes in the characteristics of DOM were investigated in the lower Phong River in Thailand in dry season and after the first rain in rainy season, using a non-targeted analysis with Orbitrap mass spectrometry. The river was rich with CHO features dominated by lignin-like molecules, while lipid-like molecules increase after domestic wastewater discharges. Wastewater discharge released DOM with higher molecular weight (MW) that was less oxygenated (low O/C) and less oxidized (low carbon oxidation state [C-os]). A lake affected by anthropogenic activities contributed more oxidized DOM into the river, while surface runoff carried DOM that is more oxygenated (high O/C), less hydrogenated (low H/C), and more oxidized (high C-os) to the stream. Water treatment further modified DOM to be lower MW. Approximately three hundred Cl-containing features (CHOCI) detected upstream were also found downstream. Disinfection by chlorine (Cl-2) or chlorine dioxide (ClO2) formed both CHO and CHOCl DBPs. Low chlorine dosage applied to upstream and downstream samples resulted in many common unknown DBPs while increasing chlorine dosage resulted in more unique DBPs. At the same dosage, Cl-2 reacted with DOM more than ClO2, including more oxidized molecules that are refractory to ClO2. Both Cl-2 and ClO2 produced chlorinated and non-chlorinated DBPs, and some DBPs were commonly found by both disinfections. Cl-2-produced DBPs were more unsaturated (higher [DBE-O]/C) and oxidized (higher C-os) than ClO2-DBPs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Off-flavors in pond-grown ictalurid catfish: Causes and management options	JOURNAL OF THE WORLD AQUACULTURE SOCIETY												Ictalurid catfish grown in ponds often acquire undesirable off-flavors prior to harvest. Off-flavors develop when odorous, lipophilic substances in food or water are absorbed across gut or gill epithelium and concentrated in edible tissues. The most common causes of catfish off-flavors are two nontoxic secondary metabolites of planktonic cyanobacteria: geosmin (causing an earthy off-flavor) and 2-methylisoborneol (causing a musty off-flavor). Off-flavored fish are unacceptable for processing, and harvest must be postponed until the source of the odorous compound disappears and the compound purges from edible fish tissue. Harvest delays caused by episodes of off-flavor increase production time, interrupt cash flow, and increase the risk of fish loss. Catfish farmers consider off-flavor to be one of their most important production-related problems. This paper reviews the causes of off-flavor in catfish, pharmacokinetics of uptake and loss of odorous compounds in catfish, seasonality and prevalence of off-flavors, farm- and industry-level impacts, the ecology of cyanobacteria in catfish ponds, and various strategies for preventing or treating cyanobacterial (and other) off-flavors. A decision-making system based on knowledge gained from research is presented as a guide to effective use of the limited tools available to manage off-flavors.																			0893-8849	1749-7345				FEB	2020	51	1					7	92		10.1111/jwas.12672	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jwas.12672		DEC 2019											WOS:000500424600001

These coastal lagoons are characterized by the steep environmental gradient and provide an excellent model system to decipher the biotic and abiotic factors that determine the bacterial community structure over time and space. Using Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes from a total of 100 bulk surface sediments, we investigated the sedimentary bacterial communities, their spatiotemporal distribution, and compared them with the rhizosphere sediment communities of a common reed; Phragmites karka and a native seagrass species; Halodule uninervis in Chilika Lagoon. Spatiotemporal patterns in bacterial communities were linked to specific biotic factors (e.g., presence and type of macrophyte) and abiotic factors (e.g., salinity) that drove the community composition. Comparative assessment of communities highlighted bacterial lineages that were responsible for segregating the sediment communities over distinct salinity regimes, seasons, locations, and presence and type of macrophytes. Several bacterial taxa were specific to one of these ecological factors suggesting that species-sorting processes drive specific biogeographical patterns in the bacterial populations. Modeling of proteobacterial lineages against salinity gradient revealed that alpha- and gamma-Proteobacteria increased with salinity, whereas beta-Proteobacteria displayed the opposite trend. The wide variety of biogeochemical functions performed by the rhizosphere microbiota of P. karka must be taken into consideration while formulating the management and conservation plan for this reed. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics and functionality of sedimentary bacterial communities and highlighted the role of biotic and abiotic factors in generating the biogeographical patterns in the bacterial communities of a tropical brackish water coastal lagoon.

Three rivers were studied over a year using eDNA metabarcoding approach. The majority of the species (c. 80%) were detected all year round in two rivers having similar hydromorphological conditions, whereas in the river affected by an upstream lake waterflow, more species were detected sporadically (42%). For all the rivers, in more than 98% of the occasional detections, the reads abundance represented <0.4% of the total reads per site and per sampling session. Even if the majority of the fish communities remained similar over the year for each of the three rivers, specific seasonal patterns were observed. We studied if the waterflow or the reproduction period had an effect on the observed dynamics. Waterflow, which influences eDNA downstream transportation, had a global influence in taxonomic richness, while the fishes' reproductive period had only an influence on certain species. Our results may help selecting the best sampling strategy according to research objectives. To study fish communities at local scale, seasons of low waterflow periods are recommended. This particularly helps to restraint effects of external eDNA coming from connections with other aquatic environment (tributaries, lakes, wetlands, sewage effluents, etc.). To obtain a more integrative overview of the fish community living in a river basin, high waterflow or breeding seasons are preferable for enhancing species detection probability, especially for rare species.					; valentini, alessio/L-3970-2013	Poulet, Nicolas/0000-0002-5611-0749; valentini, alice/0000-0001-5829-5479; Milhau, Tristan/0000-0003-0120-1384														1095-8649				FEB	2021	98	2			SI		387	398		10.1111/jfb.14190	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.14190		DEC 2019						31674010					WOS:000499880200001

Future changes in Mekong River hydrology: impact of climate change and reservoir operation on discharge	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The transboundary Mekong River is facing two ongoing changes that are expected to significantly impact its hydrology and the characteristics of its exceptional flood pulse. The rapid economic development of the riparian countries has led to massive plans for hydropower construction, and projected climate change is expected to alter the monsoon patterns and increase temperature in the basin. The aim of this study is to assess the cumulative impact of these factors on the hydrology of the Mekong within next 20-30 yr. We downscaled the output of five general circulation models (GCMs) that were found to perform well in the Mekong region. For the simulation of reservoir operation, we used an optimisation approach to estimate the operation of multiple reservoirs, including both existing and planned hydropower reservoirs. For the hydrological assessment, we used a distributed hydrological model, VMod, with a grid resolution of 5 km x 5 km. In terms of climate change's impact on hydrology, we found a high variation in the discharge results depending on which of the GCMs is used as input. The simulated change in discharge at Kratie (Cambodia) between the baseline (1982-1992) and projected time period (2032-2042) ranges from -11% to +15% for the wet season and -10% to +13% for the dry season. Our analysis also shows that the changes in discharge due to planned reservoir operations are clearly larger than those simulated due to climate change: 25-160% higher dry season flows and 5-24% lower flood peaks in Kratie. The projected cumulative impacts follow rather closely the reservoir operation impacts, with an envelope around them induced by the different GCMs. Our results thus indicate that within the coming 20-30 yr, the operation of planned hydropower reservoirs is likely to have a larger impact on the Mekong hydrograph than the impacts of climate change, particularly during the dry season. On the other hand, climate change will increase the uncertainty of the estimated reservoir operation impacts: our results indicate that even the direction of the flow-related changes induced by climate change is partly unclear. Consequently, both dam planners and dam operators should pay closer attention to the cumulative impacts of climate change and reservoir operation on aquatic ecosystems, including the multibillion-dollar Mekong fisheries.

Potential of Water Hyacinth Infestation on Lake Tana, Ethiopia: A Prediction Using a GIS-Based Multi-Criteria Technique	WATER												Water hyacinth is a well-known invasive weed in lakes across the world and harms the aquatic environment. Since 2011, the weed has invaded Lake Tana substantially posing a challenge to the ecosystem services of the lake. The major factors which affect the growth of the weed are phosphorus, nitrogen, temperature, pH, salinity, and lake depth. Understanding and investigating the hotspot areas is vital to predict the areas for proper planning of interventions. The main objective of this study is therefore to predict the hotspot areas of the water hyacinth over the surface of the lake using the geographical information system (GIS)-based multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) technique. The main parameters used in the multi-criteria analysis were total phosphorus (>0.08 mg L-1), total nitrogen (>1.1 mg L-1), temperature (<26.2 degrees C), pH (<8.6), salinity (<0.011%), and depth (<6 m). These parameters were collected from 143 sampling sites on the lake in August, December (2016), and March (2017). Fuzzy overlay spatial analysis was used to overlay the different parameters to obtain the final prediction map of water hyacinth infestation areas. The results indicated that 24,969 ha (8.1%), 21,568.7 ha (7.1%), and 24,036 ha (7.9%) of the lake are susceptible to invasion by the water hyacinth in August, December, and March, respectively. At the maximum historical lake level, 30,728.4 ha will be the potential susceptible area for water hyacinth growth and expansion at the end of the rainy season in August. According to the result of this study, the north and northeastern parts of the lake are highly susceptible for invasion. Hence, water hyacinth management and control plans shall mainly focus on the north and northeastern part of Lake Tana and upstream contributing watersheds.

J	Ehrlich, E; Kath, NJ; Gaedke, U				Ehrlich, Elias; Kath, Nadja J.; Gaedke, Ursula			The shape of a defense-growth trade-off governs seasonal trait dynamics in natural phytoplankton	ISME JOURNAL												Theory predicts that trade-offs, quantifying costs of functional trait adjustments, crucially affect community trait adaptation to altered environmental conditions, but empirical verification is scarce. We evaluated trait dynamics (antipredator defense, maximum growth rate, and phosphate affinity) of a lake phytoplankton community in a seasonally changing environment, using literature trait data and 21 years of species-resolved high-frequency biomass measurements. The trait data indicated a concave defense-growth trade-off, promoting fast-growing species with intermediate defense. With seasonally increasing grazing pressure, the community shifted toward higher defense levels at the cost of lower growth rates along the trade-off curve, while phosphate affinity explained some deviations from it. We discuss how low fitness differences of species, inferred from model simulations, in concert with stabilizing mechanisms, e.g., arising from further trait dimensions, may lead to the observed phytoplankton diversity. In conclusion, quantifying trade-offs is key for predictions of community trait adaptation and biodiversity under environmental change.																			1751-7362	1751-7370				JUN	2020	14	6					1451	1462		10.1038/s41396-020-0619-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41396-020-0619-1		MAR 2020						32127656					WOS:000517860800001

Microbial Diversity in a Hypersaline Sulfate Lake: A Terrestrial Analog of Ancient Mars	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Life can persist under severe osmotic stress and low water activity in hypersaline environments. On Mars, evidence for the past presence of saline bodies of water is prevalent and resulted in the widespread deposition of sulfate and chloride salts. Here we investigate Spotted Lake (British Columbia, Canada), a hypersaline lake with extreme (> 3 M) levels of sulfate salts as an exemplar of the conditions thought to be associated with ancient Mars. We provide the first characterization of microbial structure in Spotted Lake sediments through metagenomic sequencing, and report a bacteria-dominated community with abundant Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes, as well as diverse extremophiles. Microbial abundance and functional comparisons reveal similarities to Ace Lake, a meromictic Antarctic lake with anoxic and sulfidic bottom waters. Our analysis suggests that hypersaline-associated species occupy niches characterized foremost by differential abundance of Archaea, uncharacterized Bacteria, and Cyanobacteria. Potential biosignatures in this environment are discussed, specifically the likelihood of a strong sulfur isotopic fractionation record within the sediments due to the presence of sulfate reducing bacteria. With its high sulfate levels and seasonal freeze-thaw cycles, Spotted Lake is an analog for ancient paleolakes on Mars in which sulfate salt deposits may have offered periodically habitable environments, and could have concentrated and preserved organic materials or their biomarkers over geologic time.

This study therefore, intended to evaluate the performance of CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation Station) satellite-based rainfall products in Finchaa and Neshe watersheds of Blue Nile Basin. Daily ground- and satellite-based rainfall data are collected from Ethiopian National Meteorological Agency and CHIRPS dataset of CHG (Climate Hazards Group) respectively, for the time slice of 25 years (1991-2015). The performance of CHIRPS product is evaluated using quantitative statistical performance indicators and graphical comparison methods. CHIRPS satellite product tends to slightly overestimate the mean rainfall depth at the study area. A positive strong linear correlation (R = 0.93 and R-2 = 0.86) and a smaller amount of noise, bias and error (NSE = 0.84, PBIAS = 0.98%, and RMSE = 46.99 mm) have been found between CHIRPS satellite-based and the ground-based rainfall products when compared. The overall results in this study also indicated the good performance of CHIRPS satellite-based rainfall estimates in maintaining patterns of observed measurements at monthly, seasonal and annual time steps across the watersheds.					; GELETA, CHALA/MVV-0159-2025	Daba Geleta, Chala/0000-0002-4576-0332; 														2577-8196				JUN	2021	3	6							e12338	10.1002/eng2.12338	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eng2.12338													WOS:000661827900001

Eutrophication and climatic changes lead to unprecedented cyanobacterial blooms in a Canadian sub-Arctic landscape	HARMFUL ALGAE												Cyanobacterial blooms have been increasing in frequency and intensity but are often considered an issue restricted to temperate and tropical lakes. Here we report on one of the first occurrences of recurring cyanobacterial (Planktothrix spp.) blooms in a sub-Arctic lake from Yellowknife (Northwest Territories, Canada) and provide a long-term environmental context for the recent blooms using local meteorological data and multi-proxy paleolimnological analyses. Multiple co-occurring regional (gold mining emissions and climatic change) and local (land clearance and urbanization) stressors have impacted Jackfish Lake during the 20th and early-21st centuries, which have led to biological responses across multiple trophic levels. The unprecedented post-2013 cyanobacterial blooms were likely a cumulative response to nutrient enrichment and complex climate-mediated changes to lake thermal properties. A regional analysis of eight lakes around Yellowknife revealed that reduced ice cover duration and longer growing seasons have led to an increase in whole-lake primary production, whilst urban lakes were also fertilized by nutrients from local land-use changes in their catchments. Our findings suggest that anthropogenically nutrient-enriched sub-Arctic lakes, akin to their lower-latitude counterparts, may be vulnerable to cyanobacterial blooms in a warming world.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Simmatis, Brigitte/0000-0003-2078-1724; Sivarajah, Branaavan/0000-0002-3739-4299; Favot, Elizabeth/0000-0002-3860-8658; Palmer, Michael/0000-0002-3180-7224													1568-9883	1878-1470				MAY	2021	105								102036	10.1016/j.hal.2021.102036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2021.102036		JUN 2021						34303513					WOS:000663793200004

We addressed this challenge by using more than three decades of Landsat data. Based on in situ measurements, we developed an algorithm based on the near-infrared (NIR) band to estimate TSM in Dongting Lake. The algorithm was applied to Landsat images to derive TSM distribution maps from 1978 to 2013 in the wet season, revealing significant inter-annual and spatial variability. The relationship of TSM to water level, precipitation, and wind speed was analyzed, and we found that: (1) sand mining areas usually coincide with regions that have high TSM levels in Dongting Lake; (2) water level and seven-day precipitation were both important to TSM variation, but no significant relationship was found between TSM and wind speed or other meteorological data; (3) the increased level of sand mining in response to rapid economic growth has deeply influenced the TSM pattern since 2000 due to the resuspension of sediment; and (4) TSM variation might be associated with policy changes regarding the management of sand mining; it might also be affected by lower water levels caused by the impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam since 2000.

This river faces serious fecal contamination issues, and therefore, a comprehensive investigation to identify the sources of fecal contamination was carried out and is presented here. The performance of existing universal (BacUni and GenBac), human (HF183-Taqman, HF183-SYBR, BacHum, and Hum2), swine (Pig-2-Bac), ruminant (BacCow), and avian (AV4143 and GFD) associated microbial source tracking (MST) markers was evaluated prior to their application in this region. The specificity and sensitivity results indicated that BacUni, HF183-TaqMan, Pig-2-Bac, and GFD assays are the most suitable in identifying human and animal fecal contamination. Therefore, these markers along with marker genes specific to selected bacterial pathogens were quantified in water and sediment samples of the Tiaoxi River, collected from 15 locations over three seasons during 2014 and 2015. Total/universal Bacteroidales markers were detected in all water and sediment samples (mean concentration 6.22 log(10) gene copies/100 ml and 6.11 log(10) gene copies/gram, respectively), however, the detection of host-associated MST markers varied. Human and avian markers were the most frequently detected in water samples (97 and 89%, respectively), whereas in sediment samples, only human-associated markers were detected more often (86%) than swine (64%) and avian (8.8%) markers. The results indicate that several locations in the Tiaoxi River are heavily polluted by fecal contamination and this correlated well with land use patterns. Among the five bacterial pathogens tested, Shigella spp. and Campylobacter jejuni were the most frequently detected pathogens in water (60% and 62%, respectively) and sediment samples (91% and 53%, respectively). Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and pathogenic Leptospira spp. were less frequently detected in water samples (55% and 33%, respectively) and sediment samples (51% and 13%, respectively), whereas E. coli O157:H7 was only detected in sediment samples (11%). Overall, the higher prevalence and concentrations of Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella spp., and STEC, along with the MST marker detection at a number of locations in the Tiaoxi River, indicates poor water quality and a significant human health risk associated with this watercourse.

Environmental and biotic factors affecting freshwater snail intermediate hosts in the Ethiopian Rift Valley region	PARASITES & VECTORS												Background Knowledge of the distribution and habitat preference of freshwater snail intermediate hosts can provide information to initiate and set-up effective snail control programmes. However, there is limited research conducted on the factors driving the occurrence and abundance of freshwater snail intermediate hosts in the Ethiopian Rift Valley. Hence, in this study, we investigated how environmental and biotic factors influence the occurrence and abundance of the snail intermediate hosts in Ethiopian Rift Valley region. Methods Data on freshwater snails, physico-chemical water quality parameters, physical characteristics of habitat, predators and competitors, and anthropogenic activity variables were collected from 174 sampling sites during the wet season of 2017 and 2018. Generalized linear models were used to identify the main environmental and biotic factors affecting the occurrence and abundance of the snail species. Results It was found that Bulinus globosus (31.7%) was the most abundant snail species followed by Lymnaea natalensis (21.6%), Lymnaea truncatula (15.1%) and Biomphalaria pfeifferi (14.6%). Generalized linear models indicated that physico-chemical parameters (water temperature, turbidity, chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand, alkalinity, calcium, magnesium, nitrate and ammonia), physical habitat characteristics (water depth, canopy cover, macrophyte cover and substrate type) and biotic factors (abundance of predators and competitors) were found to be the main variables determining the occurrence and abundance of snail species in the Ethiopian Rift Valley region. In terms of anthropogenic activities, human settlement, farming, bathing and swimming, clothes washing, grazing, drainage of land, car washing, boating, fishing and silviculture were also important variables determining the occurrence and abundance of snail species in the region. Conclusions The findings reported herein suggest that integrated snail control strategies should be considered to control snails via protection of water bodies from disturbance by anthropogenic activities. In this way, it is possible to reduce the concentration of organic matter and dissolved ions in aquatic ecosystems which are conducive for the presence of snails.					; Ambelu, Argaw/KEE-8109-2024; Akessa, Geremew Muleta/LLN-0369-2024; Boets, Pieter/KEJ-0594-2024; Ambelu, Argaw/V-8317-2018; Goethals, Peter/A-1116-2008; Mereta, Seid Tiku/HIA-0661-2022	Akessa, Geremew Muleta/0000-0002-1299-7798; Ambelu, Argaw/0000-0003-1898-4100; Mereta, Seid Tiku/0000-0001-8036-4995													1756-3305					JUN 8	2020	13	1							292	10.1186/s13071-020-04163-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04163-6								32513295					WOS:000540834500003

This trend could severely threaten global climate system by chang-ing carbon cycling in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. However, the effects of SF expansion on soil and sediment or-ganic carbon (SOC) storage and carbon-nutrient stoichiometry are far from clearly understood. Therefore, we explored SOC storage and carbon-nutrient stoichiometry among adjacent NF, SF and PF using 817 samples at 0-100 cm depth increment at Poyang Lake and Shengjin Lake in the middle-lower Yangtze River floodplain, China. The SFs of the two lakes were both Carex lakeshore wetlands. The NF of Shengjin Lake was a near-natural forest, while the NF of Poyang Lake was a disturbed grassland. The results showed that SOC storage at SFs of Poyang Lake and Shengjin Lake was 75.61 and 98.01 Mg C/ha at 0-100 cm depth increment. The difference in SOC storage among nearby NF, SF and PF depended on depth and disturbance. SOC storage at SF was equivalent to that at near-natural NF, but was much higher than that at disturbed NF. SOC storage at SF was 12.62%-24.50% higher than that at PF at 0-30 cm depth increment, but was 15.16%-25.87% lower than that at PF at 0-100 cm depth increment. Edaphic carbon and nutrients followed allometric relationships at most sites and C increased faster than N and P along the depth gradients. Carbon nutrient stoichiometric relationships at SF and PF were similar, and were more coupled than those at near-natural NF. This research illustrates the strong effects of seasonal flooding on SOC sequestration in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and expands our understanding of carbon cycling in these two ecosystems.

The presence of BPs in the natural environment poses threats to the aquatic ecosystem and human health. The concentration, distribution, seasonal variation, and risk assessment of BPA and BPA structural analogs including BPB, BPF, BPS, BPZ, BPAF, and BPAP in surface water and sediment during dry season and flood season in Luoma Lake and its inflow rivers in Jiangsu Province, China, were investigated in this study. The detection frequency of BPA and BPF was 100%. Although the use of BPA is restricted, BPA is still the dominant BPs in surface water and sediment. The concentration of BPs in surface water during flood season was higher than that in dry season. The concentrations of BPs in Fangting River, Zhongyun River, and Bulao River were higher than those in Luoma Lake. The average concentrations of BPs in surface water were in the order of BPA > BPF> BPS> BPB > BPZ > BPAF> BPAP. Compared with other studies, the concentration of BPs in Luoma Lake was moderate. There is no significant spatial distribution and difference in seasonal variation of BPs concentration in sediment (p > 0.05). Compared with other studies, the contamination of BPs in sediment of Luoma Lake was relatively low. Risk quotient (RQ) was used to evaluate the ecological risk of BPs in water environment, and the 17 beta estradiol equivalent (EEQ) method was used to estimate the estrogenic activity of BPs. The risk assessment showed no high ecological risk (RQ < 1.0) and estrogenic risk (EEQ < 1.0 ng/L) in dry season and flood season. The estimated RQ and EEQ(t) indicated that the ecological and human health impacts were negligible in the short term.

Adaptation is the only option to reduce the impacts. However, before starting determining adaptation strategies, it is important to conduct scientific research to understand possible pathways of future climate change under different emission scenarios. This is essential for having scientific facts that would guide the formulation of effective adaptation strategies. In this study, climate change projections for Tanzania is carried out using outputs of high resolution Regional Climate Models (RCMs) from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment program (CORDEX). Future (2011-2100) projections of daily rainfall, minimum and maximum temperatures under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5 are compared with baseline (1971-2000) simulations. The comparison is based on determining the departure of future climate during present (2011-2040), mid (2041-2070) and end (2071-2100) centuries from baseline (1971-2000) climate condition. Results reveal that there are likely to be an obvious increased minimum and maximum temperature trend over the entire country in three future periods (2011-2040), (2041-2070), and (2071-2100) under both emission scenarios RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5. This is especially true for the western parts of the country, southwestern highlands and the eastern parts of Lake Nyasa where maximum temperatures are projected to be greater than 3.5 degrees C and in the range of 2 to 2.4 degrees C under RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5 emission scenarios respectively. The western sides of the Lake Victoria basin and parts of Northeastern highlands are likely to feature increased minimum temperatures in the range of 4.5 to 4.8 degrees C under RCP 8.5 emission scenario. The cold season: June-July-August-September (JJAS) is likely to become warmer than the warm season that starts from October and continue to April or May. During JJAS season, the country is likely to experience increased maximum temperature in the range of 1.7 to 2.4 degrees C and 2 to 4 degrees C in mid (2041-2070) and end (2070-2100) centuries respectively. Rainfall over parts of northeastern highlands and Coastal regions is projected to increase in the range of 0.5 to 1 mm/day and 0.25 to 0.5 mm/day under RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5 emission scenarios respectively. However, the western regions, southwestern highlands and eastern side of Lake Nyasa are likely to experience decreased amount of rainfall in the range of 0.5 to 1mm/day under both RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5 emission scenarios.

We address these uncertainties by comparing the molecular and isotopic composition of n-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids in recent bog sediments with all major plant species growing in the catchment of Browns Lake Bog (BLB) in Ohio, USA. There are two distinct plant assemblages at BLB, including a forest dominated by trees and a bog shoreline composed of shrubs, woody groundcover, herbs and graminoids. n-Alkane concentrations in trees were 10-300 times higher than in shoreline plants, while n-alkanoic acid concentrations were generally lower and comparable across all species. The overall range of wax delta H-2 values among individual plants (77 parts per thousand for n-C-29 alkane and 84 parts per thousand for n-C-28 alkanoic acid) was likely driven by interspecies differences in biosynthetic delta H-2 fractionation as well as source water differences between forest and shoreline plants. A considerably smaller range of delta H-2(wax) values in the bog sediments (9 parts per thousand for n-C-29 alkane and 11 parts per thousand for n-C-28 alkanoic acid) suggests that sediments are either biased toward specific plants, or that signal averaging processes during or after deposition are constant. The combined delta H-2 and delta C-13 signatures of plant sources and sediments indicate a sediment bias mainly toward trees, with contributions from woody shrubs and groundcover growing in the bog shoreline. Within trees and woody shrubs, we observed delta H-2(wax)-delta C-13(wax) relationships of opposite sign for n-C-29 alkane and n-C-28 alkanoic acid, which we speculate may reflect contrasting seasonal timing of synthesis and plant metabolic status between compound classes. The net apparent delta H-2 fractionation between precipitation and wax (epsilon(app)) was approximately 30 parts per thousand larger for n-alkanes (-133 parts per thousand) than for n-alkanoic acids (-103 parts per thousand), both at the plant level and in sediments. These results demonstrate the sensitivity of sediments in a hydrologically closed basin to woody plants growing in the associated catchment and can guide epsilon(app) estimates for sedimentary records from similar depositional settings.

J	Xiao, M; Willis, A; Burford, MA; Li, M				Xiao, Man; Willis, Anusuya; Burford, Michele A.; Li, Ming			Review: a meta-analysis comparing cell-division and cell-adhesion in Microcystis colony formation	HARMFUL ALGAE												The freshwater cyanobacterium Microcystis is a nuisance species. It forms large blooms on the water surface and overwhelmingly dominates the ecosystem through the formation of colonies from single cells surrounded by mucilage; however, the mechanism of colony formation is poorly understood. Two mechanisms of Microcystis colony formation have been proposed: cell-division, where cells remain attached after binary fission; and cell-adhesion, where single cells stick together. This paper examined the published literature on Microcysris colony formation to clarify the mechanism of colony formation and its relationship to environmental drivers. This meta-analysis showed that in laboratory experiments, colony formation by cell-division was mainly induced by zooplankton filtrate, high Pb2+ concentrations, the presence of the cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, heterotrophic bacteria, and low temperature and low light intensities. Alternatively, colony formation by cell-adhesion was mainly induced by zooplankton grazing, high Ca2+ concentrations, and microcystins. Therefore, colony formation by cell-division appears to be a slower process and to occur under an environmental stress factor, while cell-adhesion occurs more quickly to an environmental threat. Applying the criteria to the different morphospecies of Microcystis, it was found that under natural conditions M. ichthyoblabe colonies formed predominantly through cell-division, whereas M. wesenbergii colonies formed predominantly through cell-adhesion. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms and environmental drivers of colony formation by Microcystis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However. how biochar, inhibitors and the combination of biochar and inhibitors affect CH4 emissions remains unclear in paddy soils. The objective of this study was to explore the effects of biochar application alone, and in combination with urease (hydroquinone) and nitrification inhibitors (dicyandiamide) on CH4 emissions and yield-scaled CH4 emissions during three rice growing seasons in the Taihu Lake region (Suzhou and Jurong), China. In Suzhou, N fertilization rates of 120-280 kg N ha(-1) increased CH4 emissions compared to no N fertilization (Control) (P < 0.05), and the highest emission was observed at 240 kg N ha(-1). possibly due to the increase in ricederived organic carbon (C) substrates for methanogens. Biochar amendment combined with N fertilization reduced CH4 emissions by 132-27.1% compared with optimal N (ON, Suzhou) and conventional N application (CN-J, Jurong) (P < 0.05). This was related to the reduction in soil dissolved organic C and the increase in soil redox potential. Addition of urease and nitrification inhibitor (ONI) decreased CH4 emissions by 15.7% compared with ON treatment. Combined application of biochar plus urease, nitrification and double inhibitors further decreased CH4 emissions by 222-51.0% compared with ON and CN-J treatment. ON resulted in the highest yieldscaled CH4 emissions, while combined application of biochar alone and in combination with the inhibitors decreased yield-scaled CH4 emissions by 12.7-54.9% compared with ON and CN-J treatment (P < 0.05). The lowest yield-scaled CH4 emissions were observed under combined application of 7.5 t ha(-1) biochar with both urease and nitrification inhibitors. These findings suggest that combined application of biochar and inhibitors could mitigate total CH4 and yield-scaled CH4 emissions in paddy fields in this region. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Temperature is a driver in HAB forecasting models that affects both HAB growth rates and toxin production. Therefore, temperature data derived from the U.S. Geological Survey Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus thermal band products were validated across 35 lakes and reservoirs, and 24 estuaries. In situ data from the Water Quality Portal (WQP) were used for validation. The WQP serves data collected by state, federal, and tribal groups. Discrete in situ temperature data included measurements at 11,910 U.S. lakes and reservoirs from 1980 through 2015. Landsat temperature measurements could include 170,240 lakes and reservoirs once an operational product is achieved. The Landsat-derived temperature mean absolute error was 1.34 degrees C in lake pixels > 180 m from land, 4.89 degrees C at the land-water boundary, and 1.11 degrees C in estuaries based on comparison against discrete surface in situ measurements. This is the first study to quantify Landsat resolvable U.S. lakes and reservoirs, and large-scale validation of an operational satellite provisional temperature climate data record algorithm. Due to the high performance of open water pixels, Landsat satellite data may supplement traditional in situ sampling by providing data for most U.S. lakes, reservoirs, and estuaries over consistent seasonal intervals (even with cloud cover) for an extended period of record of more than 35 years.

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the coupled impacts of reservoir operations and water transfer on downstream streamflow over 42 years (1979-2020) for a tropical river in Vietnam, the Vu Gia Thu Bon (VGTB). We also quantified variations in the multi-sub-basin contributions to the water budget associated with hydraulic structure development. Therefore, a semi-distributed hydrological model, SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool), was developed for the entire VGTB basin considering two plausible scenarios: with a dam and without a dam. In this study, reservoirs substantially affected the streamflow during the 2011-2020 period when 12 cascading hydropower dams were constructed in the Vu Gia sub-basins. The cascading reservoirs across the Vu Gia River reduced the annual average streamflow by 28.1% during this period, whereas their influence was augmented by 13.9% at reaches further downstream. In contrast, the local reservoir and flow diversions created on the Thu Bon River resulted in a 6.5% increase in streamflow. The upstream reservoir operation significantly increased streamflow at the midstream stations by 27.8% compared to the no-dam period. The streamflow decreased in the dry season by 5.6% in the Vu Gia sub-basins and increased by 61.7% in the Thu Bon sub-basins. However, the impacts decreased in the wet season by 41.3% due to the operation of reservoirs, in which Dak Mi 4 had the most significant influence. It was found that the water diverted to the Thu Bon River was governed and reduced by the cascading hydropower dams. Therefore, the operation of 11 reservoirs has partially compensated for the lost water in the Vu Gia sub-basins, to which the Dak Mi 4 plant has transferred 19.7 m(3)/s (14%). Our findings classify the impact of cascading dams and diversion structures and their interaction with climate change.					; Saber, Mohamed/H-8261-2019; Van Binh, Doan/AAY-3488-2020; Sumi, Tetsuya/I-2848-2019	Binh, Doan Van/0000-0002-7687-0550; Sumi, Tetsuya/0000-0002-1423-7477; Nguyen, Binh/0000-0001-6292-5349; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				MAR	2023	37	3							e14834	10.1002/hyp.14834	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14834													WOS:000941953100001

Abrupt permafrost collapse enhances organic carbon, CO2, nutrient and metal release into surface waters	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Thawing of frozen peat in discontinuous permafrost zones may significantly modify the environment at local (slumps and engineering damages) and global (greenhouse gases regime) scales. We studied the aquatic geochemistry of CO2, CH4, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), P, Si, and colloidal trace metal from hollows, depressions, permafrost subsidences and soil waters in the actively thawing discontinuous permafrost zone of Western Siberia Lowland (WSL). This site of abrupt permafrost collapse is dominated by minerotrophic fens located within the flat mound peat bog. The CO2, DOC, major and trace metal concentrations decreased with the increase of the surface area of the water body, along the hydrological continuum (soil water -> hollows -> depressions and permafrost subsidences -> thaw ponds -> thermokarst lakes). Aqueous concentrations of CO2, CH4, Ca, Si, P, Al, Fe, Nd, and U were a factor of 4 to 10 higher in the site of catastrophic thaw compared to the steady thawing of a palsa peat bog that was previously studied in the same region. The colloids (1 kDa-0.45 mu m) formed in hot spots were strongly enriched in Fe, Al, and trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates relative to organic carbon. Because the increase in the thickness of the thawing depth intensifies the input of inorganic components from deep mineral horizons, abrupt permafrost thaw enriches the surface waters in Al-rich colloids and low molecular weight organic complexes. As a result, the WSL's surface water colloidal composition may shift from DOM-rich and DOM-Fe-rich to DOM-Al-rich, and the release of low-soluble trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates from the soil to the river will increase. We hypothesize that in sites of abrupt permafrost thaw, there is direct mobilization of soil waters to a hydrological network (rivers and lakes) and there is minimal transformation by autochthonous processes, which is unlike the case of steady permafrost thawing. Therefore, the change in physical factors, such as water pathways and the water residence time, within a given elementary landscape will likely control the overall impact of on-going permafrost thaw on both the surface water chemistry and dissolved greenhouse gas pattern of the territory. For this, high-resolution (< 2 m) remote sensing analysis of water dynamics in the permafrost landscape is necessary.

A natural hydrological change has caused this wetland to form a water-level fluctuating zone. This raises a question of whether such an area has elevated HM risks to the aquatic environment, and it was explored by a field investigation and biological exposure experiment. The results showed that Caohai sediment properties were significantly altered by water-level fluctuation, and the permanently inundated sediment had obviously higher organic matter (SOM) concentrations (32.62 +/- 937%), humification levels (ratio of C to H, 6.81 +/- 0.97), and Fe oxide fractions (1229 +/- 3.17%) than seasonally inundated sediment (4.94 +/- 2.25%, 133 +/- 0.75, and 8.72 +/- 1.87%, respectively). These significantly enhanced the competition and retention, resulting in the increased accumulation, whereas reduced bioavailability of HMs. In comparison, the mean bioaccumulation capacity of Zn, Pb and Cd by wild benthos at the seasonally inundated area respectively increased by 2, 11 and 20 times higher than that at the permanently inundated area, which was further verified in the biological incubation experiment. Our results suggest that hydraulic fluctuation can greatly shape the sediment properties to increase the ecological risks of HMs to organisms. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Methane emissions from Amazonian Rivers and their contribution to the global methane budget	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Methane (CH4) fluxes from world rivers are still poorly constrained, with measurements restricted mainly to temperate climates. Additional river flux measurements, including spatio-temporal studies, are important to refine extrapolations. Here we assess the spatio-temporal variability of CH4 fluxes from the Amazon and its main tributaries, the Negro, Solimoes, Madeira, Tapajos, Xingu, and Para Rivers, based on direct measurements using floating chambers. Sixteen of 34 sites were measured during low and high water seasons. Significant differences were observed within sites in the same river and among different rivers, types of rivers, and seasons. Ebullition contributed to more than 50% of total emissions for some rivers. Considering only river channels, our data indicate that large rivers in the Amazon Basin release between 0.40 and 0.58 Tg CH4 yr(-1). Thus, our estimates of CH4 flux from all tropical rivers and rivers globally were, respectively, 19-51% to 31-84% higher than previous estimates, with large rivers of the Amazon accounting for 22-28% of global river CH4 emissions.

M.; Kosten, Sarian			High Primary Production Contrasts with Intense Carbon Emission in a Eutrophic Tropical Reservoir	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Recent studies from temperate lakes indicate that eutrophic systems tend to emit less carbon dioxide (Co-2) and bury more organic carbon (OC) than oligotrophic ones, rendering them CO2 sinks in some cases. However, the scarcity of data from tropical systems is critical for a complete understanding of the interplay between eutrophication and aquatic carbon (C) fluxes in warm waters. We test the hypothesis that a warm eutrophic system is a source of both CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere, and that atmospheric emissions are larger than the burial of OC in sediments. This hypothesis was based on the following assumptions: (i) OC mineralization rates are high in warm water systems, so that water column CO2 production overrides the high C uptake by primary producers, and (ii) increasing trophic status creates favorable conditions for CH4 production. We measured water-air and sediment-water CO2 fluxes, CH4 diffusion, ebullition and oxidation, net ecosystem production (NEP) and sediment OC burial during the dry season in a eutrophic reservoir in the semiarid northeastern Brazil. The reservoir was stratified during daytime and mixed during nighttime. In spite of the high rates of primary production (4858 +/- 934 mg C m(-2) d(-1)), net heterotrophy was prevalent due to high ecosystem respiration (5209 +/- 992 mg C m(-2) d(-1)). Consequently, the reservoir was a source of atmospheric CO2 (518 +/- 182 mg C m(-2) d(-1)). In addition, the reservoir was a source of ebullitive (17 +/- 10 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) and diffusive CH4 (11 +/- 6 mg C m(-2) d(-1)). OC sedimentation was high (1162 mg C m(-2) d(-1)), but our results suggest that the majority of it is mineralized to CO2 (722 +/- 182 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) rather than buried as OC (440 mg C m(-2) d(-1)). Although temporally resolved data would render our findings more conclusive, our results suggest that despite being a primary production and OC burial hotspot, the tropical eutrophic system studied here was a stronger CO2 and CH4 source than a C sink, mainly because of high rates of OC mineralization in the water column and sediments.					; Nobre, Regina/P-6637-2016; Kosten, Sarian/D-7550-2011; Huszar, Vera/J-7126-2012; Silva, Lorena/AAU-5405-2021; Tonetta, Denise/AAA-9060-2019; Junger, Pedro/K-8270-2015; Barros, Nathan/D-5944-2013; Becker, Vanessa/G-6189-2015; Araújo, Fabiana/HSH-9924-2023; de Melo, Michaela/AAE-6608-2019; Miranda, Marcela/G-7811-2017; Roland, Fabio/C-7918-2013; Oliveira Junior, Ernandes Sobreira/E-3824-2019	de Melo, Michaela/0000-0002-8545-4153; Nobrega, Gabriel/0000-0001-7008-4201; NOBRE, REGINA/0000-0001-9866-3467; Huszar, Vera/0000-0002-8096-1404; Rodrigues, Jurandir/0009-0001-2319-3752; Pinheiro Silva, Lorena/0000-0002-8010-9262; Barros, Nathan/0000-0003-1752-8621; Miranda, Marcela/0000-0001-6994-8690; Oliveira Junior, Ernandes Sobreira/0000-0002-6953-6917; Becker, Vanessa/0000-0002-7326-4328													1664-302X					MAY 18	2016	7								717	10.3389/fmicb.2016.00717	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00717								27242737					WOS:000376001800001

Observation-based modelling of permafrost carbon fluxes with accounting for deep carbon deposits and thermokarst activity	BIOGEOSCIENCES												High-latitude soils store vast amounts of perennially frozen and therefore inert organic matter. With rising global temperatures and consequent permafrost degradation, a part of this carbon stock will become available for microbial decay and eventual release to the atmosphere. We have developed a simplified, two-dimensional multi-pool model to estimate the strength and timing of future carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes from newly thawed permafrost carbon (i.e. carbon thawed when temperatures rise above pre-industrial levels). We have especially simulated carbon release from deep deposits in Yedoma regions by describing abrupt thaw under newly formed thermokarst lakes. The computational efficiency of our model allowed us to run large, multi-centennial ensembles under various scenarios of future warming to express uncertainty inherent to simulations of the permafrost carbon feedback. Under moderate warming of the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6 scenario, cumulated CO2 fluxes from newly thawed permafrost carbon amount to 20 to 58 petagrams of carbon (Pg-C) (68% range) by the year 2100 and reach 40 to 98 Pg-C in 2300. The much larger permafrost degradation under strong warming (RCP8.5) results in cumulated CO2 release of 42 to 141 Pg-C and 157 to 313 PgC (68% ranges) in the years 2100 and 2300, respectively. Our estimates only consider fluxes from newly thawed permafrost, not from soils already part of the seasonally thawed active layer under pre-industrial climate. Our simulated CH4 fluxes contribute a few percent to total permafrost carbon release yet they can cause up to 40% of total permafrost-affected radiative forcing in the 21st century (upper 68% range). We infer largest CH4 emission rates of about 50 Tg-CH4 per year around the middle of the 21st century when simulated thermokarst lake extent is at its maximum and when abrupt thaw under thermokarst lakes is taken into account. CH4 release from newly thawed carbon in wetland-affected deposits is only discernible in the 22nd and 23rd century because of the absence of abrupt thaw processes. We further show that release from organic matter stored in deep deposits of Yedoma regions crucially affects our simulated circumpolar CH4 fluxes. The additional warming through the release from newly thawed permafrost carbon proved only slightly dependent on the pathway of anthropogenic emission and amounts to about 0.03-0.14 degrees C (68% ranges) by end of the century. The warming increased further in the 22nd and 23rd century and was most pronounced under the RCP6.0 scenario, adding 0.16 to 0.39 degrees C (68% range) to simulated global mean surface air temperatures in the year 2300.

To address this problem, we established a novel methodologic framework to perform comprehensive environmental risk assessment of an-tibiotics in terms of resistance development, which was based on selection effect, phenotype resistance level, heteroresistance frequency, as well as prevalence and stability of antibiotic resistance genes. We tracked the contribution of antibiotic load reduction to the mitigation of environmental risk of resistance development by fate and transport modeling. The method was instantiated in a lake-river network-basin complex system, taking the Taihu Basin as a case study. Overall, antibiotic load posed no eco-toxicological risk but an average medium -level environmental risk for resistance development in Taihu Lake. The effect of antibiotic load on resistance risk was both seasonal-dependent and category-dependent, while quinolones posed the greatest environmental risk for resistance development. Mass-flow analysis indicated that temporal-spatial variation in hydrological regime and antibiotic fate together exerted a significant effect on antibiotic load in the system. By apportioning anti-biotic load to riverine influx, we identified the hotspots for load reduction and predicted the beneficial response of resistance risk under load-reduction scenarios. Our study proposed a risk-oriented strategy of basin-scaled antibiotic load reduction for environmental risk control of resistance development.
