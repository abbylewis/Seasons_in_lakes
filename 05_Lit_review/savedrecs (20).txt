Drivers of phytoplankton responses to summer wind events in a stratified lake: A modeling study	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Extreme wind events affect lake phytoplankton by deepening the mixed layer and increasing internal nutrient loading. Both increases and decreases in phytoplankton concentration after strong wind events have been observed, but the precise mechanisms driving these responses remain poorly understood or quantified. We coupled a one-dimensional physical model to a biogeochemical model to investigate the factors regulating short-term phytoplankton responses to summer wind events, now and under expected warmer future conditions. We simulated physical, chemical, and biological dynamics in Lake Erken, Sweden, and found that strong wind could increase or decrease the phytoplankton concentration in the euphotic zone 1 week after the event, depending on antecedent lake physical and chemical conditions. Wind had little effect on phytoplankton concentration if the mixed layer was deep prior to wind exposure. Higher incoming shortwave radiation and hypolimnetic nutrient concentration boosted phytoplankton concentration, whereas higher surface water temperatures decreased concentrations after wind events. Medium-intensity wind events resulted in more phytoplankton than high-intensity wind. Simulations under a future climate scenario did not show marked differences in the way wind events affect phytoplankton concentration. These findings help to better understand how wind impacts vary as a function of local environmental conditions and how climate warming and changing extreme weather dynamics will affect lake ecosystems.					; Kasparian, Jerome/K-4700-2013; Marcé, Rafael/H-5147-2012; Ibelings, Bas/B-4237-2011; Ayala, Ana I./KNL-0648-2024; Marce, Rafael/H-5147-2012; Thomas, Mridul/HZL-6270-2023	Pierson, Donald/0000-0001-6230-0146; Kasparian, Jerome/0000-0003-2398-3882; Mesman, Jorrit/0000-0002-4319-260X; Marce, Rafael/0000-0002-7416-4652; Thayne, Michael W./0000-0003-0541-3392; Alegre Stelzer, Julio Alberto/0000-0002-4914-8925; Thomas, Mridul/0000-0002-5089-5610; Ayala Zamora, Ana Isabel/0000-0003-3986-5100; Goyette, Stephane/0000-0001-5199-5974; Markensten, Hampus/0000-0003-1065-8482													0024-3590	1939-5590				APR	2022	67	4					856	873		10.1002/lno.12040	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.12040		FEB 2022											WOS:000754307000001

Monitoring atmospheric levels and deposition of dioxin-like pollutants in sub-alpine Northern Italy	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												The objective of this work was to assess the atmospheric occurrence, seasonal variations and deposition of dioxin-like pollutants (17 PCDD/Fs + 12 DL-PCBs) in sub-alpine northern Italy. A total of 108 weekly integrated samples (aerosol + gas phases) were collected during a 1-year period (2005-2006) at the Ispra EMEP site (Northern Italy, 45 degrees 49'N, 8 degrees 38'E). Atmospheric loadings into Lake Maggiore were also estimated by implementing a deposition model. Sigma 2,3,7,8-PCDD/F atmospheric total concentrations were dominated by the aerosol-bound fraction which ranged from 50 to 3080 (1-215 WHO98 TEQ) fg m(-3). In contrast DL-PCB levels were dominated by the gas phase concentrations and varied from 1800 to 14800 (1-5 WHO98 TEQ) fg m(-3). The aerosol and gas phase concentrations of PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs exhibited a similar seasonality (higher values in winter time for aerosol-bound contaminants and lower concentrations for gas phase contaminants) in spite of their different environmental sources and properties. Estimated total atmospheric (dry + wet) depositional fluxes of dioxin-like pollutants in sub-alpine northern Italy were similar to 0.2-similar to 9.5 ng m(-2) d(-1), with wet deposition dominating. Total atmospheric inputs (2,3,7,8-PCDD/Fs + DL-PCBs) into lake Maggiore ranged from 14 to 304 g y(-1). Higher environmental concentrations of dioxin-like pollutants in sub-alpine northern Italy are expected in the cold season and in rainy days due to a combined effect of stagnant atmospheric conditions (low winds), household wood burning in the region and higher pollutant loads via rainfall in winter.

Realignments of the Colorado River by ∼2 m.y. of rotational bedrock landsliding: The Surprise Valley landslide complex, Grand Canyon, Arizona	GEOSPHERE												The Surprise Valley landslide complex is the name used here for a group of prominent river-damming landslides in Grand Canyon (Arizona, USA) that has shifted the path of the Colorado River several times in the past 2 m.y. We document a sequence of eight landslides. Three are Toreva-block landslides containing back-rotated but only mildly disrupted bedrock stratigraphy. The largest of these landslides, Surprise Valley landslide, is hypothesized to have dammed the Colorado River, cut off a meander loop through Surprise Valley, and rerouted the river 2.5 km south to near its present course at the Granite Narrows. Another bedrock landslide, Poncho's runup, involved a mass detachment from the north side of the river that drove a kilometer-scale bedrock slab across the river and up the south canyon wall to a height of 823 m above the river. A lake behind this landslide is inferred from the presence of mainstem gravels atop the slide that represent the approximate spillway elevation. We postulate that this landslide lake facilitated the upriver 133 Mile slide detachment and Toreva block formation. The other five landslides are subsequent slides that consist of debris from the primary slides; these also partially blocked and diverted the Colorado River as well as the Deer Creek and Tapeats Creek tributaries into new bedrock gorges over the past 1 m.y. The sequence of landslides is reconstructed from inset relationships revealed by geologic mapping and restored cross-sections. Relative ages are estimated by measuring landslide base height above the modern river level in locations where landslides filled paleochannels of the Colorado River and its tributaries. We calculate an average bedrock incision rate of 138 m/m.y. as determined by a 0.674 +/- 0.022 Ma detrital sanidine maximum depositional age of the paleoriver channel fill of the Piano slide, which has its base 70 m above the river level and similar to 93 m above bedrock level beneath the modern river channel. This date is within error of, and significantly refines, the prior cosmogenic burial date of 0.88 +/- 0.44 Ma on paleochannel cobbles. Assuming steady incision at 138 m/m.y., the age of Surprise Valley landslide is estimated to be ca. 2.1 Ma; Poncho's runup is estimated to be ca. 610 ka; and diversion of Deer Creek to form modern Deer Creek Falls is estimated to be ca. 400 ka. The age of the most recent slide, Backeddy slide, is estimated to be ca. 170 ka based on its near-river-level position. Our proposed triggering mechanism for Surprise Valley landslides involves groundwater saturation of a failure plane in the weak Bright Angel Formation resulting from large volumes of Grand Canyon north-rim groundwater recharge prior to establishment of the modern Deer, Thunder, and Tapeats springs. Poncho's and Piano landslides may have been triggered by shale saturation caused by 600-650 ka lava dams that formed 45 river miles (73 river km; river miles are measured along the Colorado River downstream from Lees Ferry, with 1 river mile = 1.62 river kms) downstream near Lava Falls. We cannot rule out effects from seismic triggering along the nearby Sinyala fault. Each of the inferred landslide dams was quickly overtopped (tens of years), filled with sediment (hundreds of years), and removed (thousands of years) by the Colorado River, as is also the potential fate of modern dams.

J	Fer, I; Lemmin, U; Thorpe, SA				Fer, I; Lemmin, U; Thorpe, SA			Observations of mixing near the sides of a deep lake in winter	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass, epsilon, vertical eddy diffusivity, K(z), and the rate of dissipation of temperature variance, X, are estimated over the sloping sides of Lake Geneva both far from and near the bed, using temperature data from horizontal tracks of a submarine during periods of winter cooling. The estimated values are about one order of magnitude greater near the slope than those distant from it. The mean dissipation rate per unit mass averaged over the epilimnion varies between O(10(-10)) m(2) s(-3) in calm weather to O(10(-8)) m(2) s(-3) in winds of 8 m s(-1), for surface buoyancy fluxes of 6 x 10(-9) m(2) s(-3) and 1.1 x 10(-8) m(2) s(-3), whereas near the slope e has an average value of 3 x 10(-8) m(2) s(-3). The relation between K(2) and epsilonN(-2) (where N is the buoyancy frequency) is examined. Values of the mixing efficiency, Gamma = epsilonN(-2)K(z)(-t), of 0.15 +/- 0.1 and 0.16 +/- 0.1 are obtained in the upper 10-m layer for calm and windy conditions, respectively. Near the slope, Gamma is found to be 0.22 +/- 0.2, slightly larger than in surface layers under windy conditions. Different mixing mechanisms in different regions, near the slope and in the surface waters of the epilimnion and relatively calm deeper layers, can be identified in the diagram of overturn Froude number versus overturn Reynolds number. Mixing near the slope in the epilimnion appears to be related to the gravitational winter cascading of cold water down the sloping sides of the lake.

J	MURTAUGH, PA				MURTAUGH, PA			VERTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF ZOOPLANKTON AND POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF DAPHNIA IN A MEROMICTIC LAKE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Vertical distributions of zooplankton were studied in relation to profiles of temperature, O2 and chlorophyll a in Roi Lake, a small meromictic lake in central Alberta [Canada]. Zooplankton were distributed fairly evenly through the oxygenated part of the water column in early summer, but a gradual descent of several species became evident in June. The vertical distribution of chlorophyll was dominated by a huge peak at the 8- to 9-m-deep chemocline the location of a plate of photosynthetic S bacteria. Ambient concentration of chlorophyll was a poor predictor of the numbers of zooplankton and the fecundity of D. pulicaria at different depths, and per capita birth rates of Daphnia were usually highest in the surface waters. The reproductively disadvantageous restriction of daphnids to deep water by late summer and their catastrophic decline in the face of high ambient concentrations of chlorophyll suggest that factors other than temperature and food supply are important in influencing the dynamics and distribution of zooplankton in this lake.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1985	123	1					47	57		10.1007/BF00006614	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006614													WOS:A1985AGE3600002

For the continent or urban aerosol model does not fit the needs for more accurate retrieval,. and the user defined aerosol model may be more near to the realistic condition in Taihu region. A method has been developed for retrieving the aerosol model and optical properties including polarization, i.e., scattering coefficient, asymmetry factor, single scattering albedo, scattering phase function and polar phase function. In Lake Taihu, the study area of our two combined remote sensing observations in the winter and summer 2006, we got water surface spectral data of ASD (Analytical Spectral Devices) by the ship, atmospheric data of CE318 sunphotometer on the shore, and the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spcectroradiometer) image data on the TERRA Satellite. By using the nearly synchronous measurements of the data from surface spectrum and the sunphotometer with the image, and by use of the radiative transfer model 6S(Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum), varying the components of the aerosol type, a LUT (look up table) is made for the radiance on the satellite. When the total relative error of the new defined parameter for relative error is getting to the least, the aerosol type will be decided. Then, based on the determination of aerosol model, the atmospheric aerosol properties over Lake Taihu have been computed by using Mie theory and analyzed with the typical continental and urban aerosol models available in 6S. These results show that the user-defined aerosol model is a mix model of continent and urban which corresponds with previous studies. Moreover, they may be useful for resolving the vector RTE (radiative transfer equation).

In the present study in the Strait of Gibraltar, we analyse internal soliton signals recorded in different locations in their eastward propagation from their release point (Camarinal Sill) to the continental slope of the northwestern Alboran Sea. Moreover, the effect of subinertial forcing on the release of solitons is also explored. The internal soliton activity was assessed from different approaches: (i) in-situ data (i.e., current and temperature measurements or High Frequency Radar), (ii) numerical modelling, and (iii) an analytical approach. The arrival of solitons over the continental slope of the north-western Alboran Sea showed fortnightly variability in both number (occurrence) and amplitude during spring tides when compared with during neap tides. The observed arrival times of the solitons oscillated between 14 (spring tides) and 20 h (neap tides). Nevertheless, to provide a comprehensive explanation for the fluctuations in travel times, it is necessary to consider the subinertial variability driven by atmospheric forcing, which impacts both the flow in the Strait of Gibraltar and the mesoscale patterns in the Alboran Sea (e.g., the Coastal Cyclonic Gyre).

Histopathology of brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus), smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) in relation to polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination in the Hudson River	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												From the 1940s through 1977, at least 590,000 kg of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were released into the Hudson River from General Electric manufacturing plants located in Hudson Falls and Fort Edward, New York. In 1984, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designated a nearly 322 km reach as the Hudson River PCBs Superfund Site. Here we describe a Fish Health Assessment study, part of a Natural Resource Damage Assessment, that evaluated the prevalence of toxicopathic lesions in adult brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus), smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), and yellowperch (Perca flavescens). In fall 2001, 29-51 fish of each species were collected in fall 2001 from highly contaminated areas below the plants (Thompson Island Pool (TIP) and Stillwater Dam Pool (STW)), an upriver reference area (Feeder Dam Pool (FDP)), and a reference lake, Oneida Lake (ODA). The focus was on histopathologic lesions and observations associated with contaminant exposure: liver-neoplasms, foci of cellular alteration, bile duct hyperplasia; testes-ovotestis (testicular oocytes), germ cell degeneration, altered developmental stage; ovaries-atresia and altered developmental stage. Lesions associated with PCB exposure were defined as those with significantly greater prevalence and/or severity in TIP and STW compared with ODA and FDP. For brown bullhead and smallmouth bass, no lesions or changes in gonadal development met those criteria. In yellow perch, ovarian atresia was the only lesion associated with PCB exposure. Prevalence was 53% in FDP, 75% in ODA, and 100% in both STW and TIP; severity increased from mostly minimal to mild-moderate. Because of the high prevalence of atresia in reference collections, it is likely that factors other than PCBs are also involved. As part of a post-dredging monitoring plan, we recommend assessing gonad structure and function in yellow perch collected at the time of spawning in locations with a range of PCB contamination.

Hydro-climatic Characteristics of Yarlung Zangbo River Basin since the Last Glacial Maximum	ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												Global climate changes significantly impact the water condition of big rivers in glacierized high mountains. However, there is a lack of studies on hydrological changes within river basins caused by climate changes over a geological timescale due to the impossibility of direct observations. In this study, we examine the hydro-climatic variation of the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin in the Tibet Plateau since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) by combining delta O-18 proxy records in Indian and Omani caves with the simulated Indian summer monsoon, surface temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration and runoff via the Community Climate System Model and the reconstructed glacier coverage via the Parallel Ice Sheet Model. The mean river runoff was kept at a low level of 145 billion cubic meters per year until an abrupt increase at a rate of 8.7 million cubic meters per year in the Bolling-Allerod interval (BA). The annual runoff reached a maximum of 250 billion cubic meters in the early Holocene and then reduced to the current value of 180 billion cubic meters at a rate of 6.4 million cubic meters per year. The low runoff in the LGM and Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1) is likely attributed to such a small contribution of precipitation to runoff and the large glacier cover. The percentage of precipitation to runoff was only 20% during the LGM and HS1. Comparison of glacier area among different periods indicates that the fastest deglaciation occurred during the late HS1, when nearly 60% of glacier area disappeared in the middle reach, 50% in the upper reach, and 30% in the lower reach. The rapid deglaciation and increasing runoff between the late HS1 and BA may have accelerated widespread ice-dam breaches and led to extreme outburst flood events. Combining local geological proxy records and regional simulations could be a useful approach for the study of paleo-hydrologic variations in big river basins.

The results showed that the main behavior of oriental white stork were resting (40.07 +/- 3.21%) and foraging (35.44 +/- 2.42%), followed by moving (13.46 +/- 1.01%) and preening (9.05 +/- 0.62%). The patterns of time budgets were similar in early and later wintering periods. Daily minimum temperature showed a significant linear relationship with foraging and resting. Foraging was significantly positively correlated with daily minimum temperature, and resting was significantly negatively correlated with daily minimum temperature, which indicated that minimum temperature was the key factor affecting stork behavior in winter. Foraging behavior peaked at 7:00-7:59 and 16:00-16:59 hours and resting peaked at 11:00-11:59 hour. Oriental white stork foraging habitats varied in different months and gradually shifted from shallow water to grassland. Their average moving rate was 17.86 +/- 0.61 steps/min, pecking rate was 8.31 +/- 0.25, and pecking success rate was 1.03 +/- 0.04 pecks/min. In shallow water, average pecking rate was significantly positively correlated with moving rate and pecking success rate. In mudflats and grasslands, moving rate was significantly negatively correlated with pecking success rate. We argued that oriental white stork use different foraging methods and prey capture techniques in different habitats, possibly because food resources in mudflats and grasslands differ from those in shallow water. The oriental white stork mainly preyed on fish in shallow water, and it handled large-sized fishes (>15 cm) for 201.07 +/- 35.31 sec (n=23), and small-sized fishes (<15 cm) for 85.22 +/- 20.86 sec (n=14).																			0030-9923					FEB	2015	47	1					71	78																WOS:000350843000010

Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) and water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes) hit the Great Lakes: playing with fire?	AQUATIC INVASIONS												The Laurentian Great Lakes have been successfully invaded by at least 182 nonindigenous species. Here we report on two new species, water hyacinth Eichhornia crassipes and water lettuce Pistia stratiotes, that were found at a number of locations in Lake St. Clair and Detroit River during autumn 2010. Both species are commonly sold in the water garden and aquarium trade in southern Ontario and elsewhere. While it is not clear whether these species arc established or can establish in the Great Lakes, the historic assumption that neither of these subtropical to tropical plants pose an invasion risk must be questioned in the light of changing environmental conditions associated with climate warming that may render Great Lakes' habitats more suitable for these species and increase the likelihood of their successful establishment.

J	Horppila, J; Köngäs, P; Niemistö, J; Hietanen, S				Horppila, Jukka; Kongas, Petrina; Niemisto, Juha; Hietanen, Susanna			Oxygen flux and penetration depth in the sediments of aerated and non-aerated lake basins	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												The effects of hypolimnetic aeration on oxygen penetration depth and oxygen flux into the sediment (DOU) were studied during two successive years. The study was conducted by comparing data from the aerated Enonselka basin with the non-aerated Kajaanselka basin of Lake Vesijarvi (southern Finland). Aeration increased the average O-2 concentration in near-bottom layers. This was mainly due to shortened stratification period in the aerated basin, which was again attributed to the positive effect of aeration on hypolimnetic water temperature. Aeration did not prevent hypoxia during summer stratification and oxygen penetration depth in the sediment and DOU did not increase. During summer stratification DOU was even lower at the aerated than at the non-aerated basin. The weak effect of aeration on DOU and oxygen penetration was mostly due to the minor effect on hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations. The positive effect of aeration on hypolimnetic O-2 concentration was negated by the positive effects of aeration on hypolimnetic temperature and turbulence that increase oxygen consumption in the water column.

In glacier-dominated systems, previous studies have focused on the distance from glaciers as the primary control on stream temperature and chemistry. However, other watershed attributes including groundwater, lakes, topography, and vegetation may also have a strong impact. Here, we quantified the watershed properties that most influence stream temperature and specific conductivity over a summer season. We used spatially distributed 15-minute observations of stream temperature and conductivity in the glaciated Dinwoody Creek watershed in the Wind River Range in western Wyoming. Though the amount of perennial ice and snow was an important predictor for all variables, it was not significant in mid-summer. However, the percentage of the watershed with gneiss bedrock was significant for mean temperature and the terrain ruggedness near the stream channel was significant for conductivity. These results indicate that lithology and topography, both indicators of surface water-groundwater interaction, are important for predicting alpine stream water quality. These findings highlight the need for a broad understanding of how the landscape mosaic influences critical water quality parameters in rapidly changing mountain ecosystems.																			1523-0430	1938-4246				DEC 31	2025	57	1							2560144	10.1080/15230430.2025.2560144	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15230430.2025.2560144													WOS:001593159400001

Environmental change inferred from multiple proxies from an 18 cal ka BP sediment record, Lake Barrine, NE Australia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Lake Barrine (17.25 degrees S, 145.64(degrees)E), on the Atherton Tablelands in tropical northeast Australia, was formed as a maar lake in the late Pleistocene. The 65 m-deep stratified lake provides a detailed sediment record of climate and environmental change on the Tablelands. We reconstruct hydroclimate and vegetation change over the last similar to 18,000 years from a 7.2 m long sediment core at 20-year resolution using multiple paleoenvironmental proxies (mu-XRF elements, delta C-13(TOC), TOC and C:N ratio). The data series are supported by a chronology based on 22 accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) radiocarbon dates. The results suggest a distinct period of intense but highly seasonal rainfall coincident with the Antarctic Cold Reversal (14.7-13.0 cal ka BP). This period was followed by a trend into the early Holocene toward wetter, less seasonal conditions that allowed the progressive establishment of tropical forest in the catchment. The catchment was completely covered by closed forest by 7.3 cal ka BP. The inferred precipitation changes at Lake Barrine are consistent with other records on the Tablelands and in phase with the changes in tropical SE Africa, NW Australia and anti-phase with the East Asian summer monsoon region in the Holocene but not before that. This result supports previous conclusions that precipitation variations correlate (in phase or anti-phased) in these regions. This correlation results from a dynamic balance among intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Management of such mobile populations is often hindered by lack of knowledge of the patterns and rates of movement among the areas. In northern Wisconsin, spring population estimates (PEs) of walleyes Stizostedion vitreum are used in managing the joint tribal-sport angler fishery. Many lakes in this region are interconnected by streams or waterways that allow movement of walleyes among lakes. Because the movement of fish among lakes complicates the interpretation and use of PEs, we estimated postspawning movement rates of walleyes among interconnected lakes in four different lake chains (of two, two, four, and five lakes). Walleyes were captured and released on three occasions in each chain, with marks to indicate in which lake within the chain they were originally captured. We used Akaike's information criterion to select among four stratified capture-recapture models, with or without mortality and with constant or variable capture rates. We assumed that recaptures followed a Poisson distribution. In all lake chains, a model with mortality and constant capture rates fit approximately as well as one with no mortality and variable capture rates. These two models generated similar estimates of movement rates for surviving fish. Walleyes moved among lakes in all chains as they left spawning areas and apparently moved to feeding areas. In some lakes, model estimates indicated that at least half of all walleyes present at spawning might leave the lake within 1 week. Results for these chains suggested that although spring PEs are appropriate for setting quotas for harvest activities done at or just after spawning, such as spearing, individual lake PEs may be misleading for managing activities that occur throughout the year, such as sport angling.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV	2002	131	6					1020	1032		10.1577/1548-8659(2002)131<1020:EPMOWA>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2002)131<1020:EPMOWA>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000180881100002

The occurrence and removal of algae (including cyanobacteria) and their related organic compounds from source water in Vaalkop Dam with conventional and advanced drinking water treatment processes	WATER SA												Cyanobacterial bloom formation in freshwaters, such as rivers, lakes and dams, is known to occur throughout the world. The Vaalkop Dam, which serves as source to the Vaalkop drinking water treatment works (DWTW), is no exception. Blooms of cyanobacteria occur annually in Vaalkop Dam as well as in dams from which Vaalkop is replenished during low-rainfall periods. These blooms during the summer months are associated with the production of cyanotoxins and taste and odour compounds such as geosmin and MIB. The Vaalkop DWTW uses a combination of conventional and advanced water treatment processes to deal with the cyanobacteria and their related organic compounds in the source water. The overall objectives of this study were to: (i) investigate the occurrence of algae (including cyanobacteria) and cyanotoxins in the Vaalkop Dam; (ii) establish which environmental variables are responsible for the development and onset of algae, and (iii) determine whether the Vaalkop DWTW is able to eliminate the influence that algae (including cyanobacteria) may have on the drinking water. Multivariate statistical analyses revealed seasonal variation in algal assemblages in the raw water. The risk of cyanobacteria bloom formation proved to be especially high during the summer months as the nutrients needed for cyanobacterial growth are available and the temperature range is optimal, causing the production of geosmin, MIB and microcystin. The presence of Ceratium hirundinella (O.F.Muller) Dujardin, in the source water appears to exacerbate the negative effect that cyanobacteria have on the drinking water treatment process. When Ceratium hirundinella is present, floc formation is inhibited, causing more of the problematic algae to penetrate into the drinking water. Even though advanced treatment options such as ozone and granular activated carbon filters are used at Vaalkop DWTW, the effects of the organic compounds produced by cyanobacteria are not entirely eliminated during the treatment process.																			0378-4738	1816-7950				JAN	2017	43	1					67	80		10.4314/wsa.v43i1.10	http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/wsa.v43i1.10													WOS:000396502100010

The effective accumulated water temperature (EAWT) in months from March to June was calculated with daily monitoring data from the Taihu Laboratory for Lake Ecosystem Research (TLLER). The concentrations of Chl-a and nutrients significantly decreased from Meiliang Bay to Central Lake. Annual averages of the total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and Chl-a concentrations, and EAWT generally increased in the nine years. In Meiliang Bay, the concentration of Chl-a was significantly correlated with EAWT, ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N ), TN, the soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), TP, and SS. In Central Lake, however, the concentration of Chl-a was only correlated with EAWT, TP, and SS. Multiple stepwise linear regression revealed that EAWT, dissolved total phosphorus (DTP), and TP explained 99.2% of the variation of Chl-a in Meiliang Bay, and that EAWT, NH4+-N , and TP explained 98.7% of the variation of Chl-a in Central Lake. Thus EAWT is an important factor influencing the annual change of phytoplankton biomass. Extreme climate change, such as extremely hot springs or cold springs, could cause very different bloom intensities in different years. It is also suggested that both nutrients and EAWT played important roles in the growth of phytoplankton in Taihu Lake. The climate factors and nutrients dually controlled the risk of harmful algal blooms in Taihu Lake. Cutting down phosphorus and nitrogen loadings from catchments should be a fundamental strategy to reduce the risk of blooms in Taihu Lake.

J	Pang, Y; Zhou, B; Ma, CM; Jiang, JW; Taylor, D; Lu, YH				Pang, Yang; Zhou, Bin; Ma, ChunMei; Jiang, JiaWei; Taylor, David; Lu, YueHan			Alkane variation in peat reveals palaeohydrological changes since the Little Ice Age in eastern China	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) system plays a crucial role in regulating climatic and hydrological variability in East Asia. The hydrological effects of the EASM in eastern China during the Little Ice Age (LIA) remains controversial, however. Here, we established a relatively high-resolution palaeohydrological record over the last 700 years in East China via analyzing n-alkanes from a peat core. Mid- and long-chain (C-21-C-25 and C-27-C-31) n-alkanes account for more than 95% of the total odd-carbon-numbered n-alkanes, with short-chain n-alkanes (C-17-C-19) accounting for only 2.3% on average, suggesting that organic matter in the peat core originated primarily from vascular plants. Organic geochemical indices, including P-aq (an indicator of contributions from aquatic plants), the average chain length (ACL) of long-chain n-alkanes, and C-31/C-27 and C-23/C-29 n-alkane ratios, suggest a transition from dry conditions during the middle LIA to wet conditions in the late LIA. Comparing P-aq records from the study profile with previous records from the EASM region, we found that the northern and southern parts of eastern China showed contrasting changes in humidity during the LIA. Specifically, the southern part shifted from mid-LIA dry conditions to late-LIA wet conditions, whereas the northern part shifted from mid-LIA wet conditions to late-LIA dry conditions. This spatial heterogeneity in hydroclimate could be attributed to La Nina-like conditions and intense summer monsoons during the middle LIA and El Nino-like conditions and weak summer monsoons during the late LIA. Our study demonstrates the importance of understanding spatial heterogeneity of hydroclimatic changes to probe the mechanisms whereby EASM modulates regional climatic changes during the LIA.

J	Lowenstein, TK; Risacher, F				Lowenstein, Tim K.; Risacher, Francois			Closed Basin Brine Evolution and the Influence of Ca-Cl Inflow Waters: Death Valley and Bristol Dry Lake California, Qaidam Basin, China, and Salar de Atacama, Chile	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Diagenetic-hydrothermal brines, here called "hydrothermal Ca-Cl brines," have compositions that reflect interactions between groundwaters and rocks or sediments at elevated temperatures. Hydrothermal Ca-Cl brines reach the surface by convection-driven or topographically driven circulation, and discharge as springs or seeps along fault zones to become important inflow waters in many tectonically active closed basins. Case studies from (1) Qaidam Basin, China, (2) Death Valley, California, (3) Salar de Atacama, Chile, and (4) Bristol Dry Lake, California illustrate that hydrothermal Ca-Cl inflow waters have influenced brine evolution in terms of major ion chemistries and mineral precipitation sequences. All four basins are tectonically active; three (Death Valley, Salar de Atacama, and Qaidam Basin) have well-documented Ca-Cl spring inflow and Holocene faulting. Bristol Dry Lake has young volcanic deposits and Salar de Atacama has an active stratovolcano on its eastern margin, indicating subsurface magma bodies. A midcrustal magma chamber has been identified in southern Death Valley. Volcanism and faulting in these closed basins provides the heat source for hydrothermal-diagenetic processes and the energy and pathways to deliver these waters to the surface.																			1380-6165	1573-1421				FEB	2009	15	1-2					71	94		10.1007/s10498-008-9046-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10498-008-9046-z													WOS:000264831200004

Larval Lake Whitefish abundance, diet and growth and their zooplankton prey abundance during a period of ecosystem change on the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Studies to examine larval Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) abundance, diet composition and growth, and the abundance of their zooplankton prey were conducted during eight years (1991-1993, 1995-1996 and 2003-2005) over the course of two decades that spanned a period of major ecosystem change-primarily dreissenid mussel related impacts-on the Bay of Quinte, northeastern Lake Ontario. Larval fish were captured in shallow, nearshore waters (0.2-2.0 m) from early April to mid-May each year. Larval Lake Whitefish fed primarily on cyclopoid copepods and small-bodied cladocerans. The key finding of our studies was that prey abundance declined by 89% from the earlier (1991-1993, 1995-1996) to the later (2003-2005) sampling years. Larval fish growth during spring was significantly correlated with prey availability. Recruitment to the juvenile stage in August was correlated with spring prey availability and larval fish growth. The observed decline in larval Lake Whitefish prey in the Bay of Quinte may be contributing to poor stock performance during and following a period of significant ecosystem change.																			1463-4988						2011	14	1					66	74		10.1080/14634988.2011.548730	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2011.548730													WOS:000288197500008
J	Beltaos, S				Beltaos, Spyros			Using Logistic Regression to Identify the Key Hydrologic Controls of Ice-Jam Flooding near the Peace-Athabasca Delta: Assessment of Uncertainty and Linkage with Physical Process Understanding	WATER												The Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) in northern Alberta is one of the world's largest inland freshwater deltas and is home to many species of fish, mammals, and birds. Over the past five decades, the PAD has experienced prolonged dry periods in between rare floods, accompanied by a reduction in the area comprised of lakes and ponds that provide a habitat for aquatic life. In the Peace sector of the PAD, this likely resulted from a reduced frequency of spring flooding caused by major ice jams that form in the lower Peace River. There is debate in the literature regarding the factors that promote or inhibit the formation of such ice jams, deriving from physical process studies, paleolimnological studies, and-recently-statistical analysis founded in logistic regression. Logistic regression attempts to quantify ice-jam flood (IJF) probability, given the values of assumed explanatory variables, involve considerable uncertainty. Herein, different sources of uncertainty are examined and their effects on statistical inferences are evaluated. It is shown that epistemic uncertainty can be addressed by selecting direct explanatory variables, such as breakup flow and ice cover thickness, rather than through more convenient, albeit weak, proxies that rely on winter precipitation and degree-days of frost. Structural uncertainty, which derives from the unknown mathematical relationship between IJF probability and the selected explanatory variables, leads to different probability predictions for different assumed relationships but does not modify assessments of statistical significance. The uncertainty associated with the relatively small sample size (number of years of record) may be complicated by known physical constraints on IJF occurrence. Overall, logistic regression corroborates physical understanding that points to breakup flow and freezeup level as primary controls of IJF occurrence. Additional influences, related to the thermal decay of the ice cover and the flow gradient during the advance of the breakup front towards the PAD, are difficult to quantify at present. Progress requires increased monitoring of processes and an enhanced numerical modelling capability.

Winter severity, fish community, and availability to traps explain most of the variability in estimates of adult sea lamprey in Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Animal populations are assessed to estimate rates of artificial and natural mortality at ecologically relevant spatial and temporal scales to develop exploitation quotas. But how the population's natural mortality rate and how the ability to observe the population changes through time are poorly understood in most invasive fishes, despite efforts to control their populations. By investigating a 30-year abundance index of invasive sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) in Lake Superior, we found that the index was highly correlated (R-2 = 0.75) with biotic and abiotic factors hypothesized to influence sea lamprey natural mortality and their availability to index traps. The index was lowest in years (1) following winters with above average ice cover on Lake Superior, (2) when stream discharge during sea lamprey migration was below average, (3) when adult sea lamprey were smaller than average, and (4) when adult sea lamprey were more likely to be distributed in tributaries on the east side of Lake Superior. These results highlight the need for policy makers to consider invasive species abundance indexes not just in the context of control effort, but also in the context of biotic and abiotic conditions because they could markedly influence natural mortality or the ability to observe highly suppressed populations.

Core MD77-169 covers the last 280 kyr and core MD77-180 covers the last 160 kyr. In both cores, rock magnetic parameters indicate that the magnetic assemblage is dominated by pseudo-single domain titanomagnetite grains, with grain-size variations following a strong 23 kyr periodicity. Smaller magnetic grain sizes are observed during periods characterized by a strong summer monsoon. In addition, in core MD77-180, we observe a correlation between magnetic grain size and a chemical index of alteration. This suggests that these magnetic grain-size changes are related to chemical weathering driven by summer monsoon rainfall. A comparison of the GISP2 ice core isotopic record and the magnetic grain-size record of the Bay of Bengal shows that rapid temperature variations documented in the ice core (Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles and Heinrich events), during the last glacial period are also present in the magnetic grain-size record. Heinrich events and cold stadial events are characterized by relatively large magnetic grain sizes. Furthermore, Heinrich events are characterized by lower values of the chemical index of alteration implying a lower degree of chemical weathering related to significantly drier conditions on the continent, We suggest that rapid cold events of the North Atlantic (Heinrich events) during the last glacial stages are characterized by a weaker summer monsoon rainfall over the Himalaya via an atmospheric teleconnection.

J	Ohlendorf, C; Niessen, F; Weissert, H				Ohlendorf, C; Niessen, F; Weissert, H			Glacial varve thickness and 127 years of instrumental climate data: A comparison	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Annually laminated sediments (glacial varves) from Lake Silvaplauna, a High Alpine proglacial lake in the Central Swiss Alps, were compared with glacier monitoring data and instrumental climate data from 1864 to 1990. Long-term and short-term responses to climatic change as well as anthropogenic influence can be traced separately in the varve succession. Economic development in the lake catchment has resulted in higher autochthonous production in recent years. Autochthonous components contribute around 10% to the total amount of sediment accumulated annually since 1960 but their contribution is negligible before this date. Decadal-scale varve thickness trends correlate with glacier size-variations. A stepwise, running multiple regression analysis demonstrates that interannual changes in varve thickness are strongly correlated with changes in mean summer temperatures, but cannot be sufficiently explained without considering summer precipitation and the number of days with snow per year. The wide range of observed correlation coefficients reveals the sensitivity of the archive to temporal variability of the climatic forcing factors and makes the development of transfer functions ambiguous.

Significant rises in annual mean values were apparent and broadly followed changes in air temperature. However, especially in relation to seasonal mean values, trends were influenced by catchment characteristics and contrasts were evident between sites located in a headwater tributary, at the outlet of a catchment with a sizeable lake area, and on the mainstream of the Danube. There is evidence that inter-annual variations in water temperature were influenced by the climate pattern of the North Atlantic Oscillation, especially in the winter months.																			0262-6667					FEB	2007	52	1					74	85		10.1623/hysj.52.1.74	http://dx.doi.org/10.1623/hysj.52.1.74													WOS:000244180100006

Such variability at the species level may result from individuals themselves being very variable or, alternatively, variability may arise from differences between individuals. The aim of this study was to explore land use in general and between-subject variability in the local movements and daily activity patterns of Mallards Anas platyrhynchos in central Switzerland during the winter. The Mallard is a common duck species and can be found on almost all types of water bodies. We equipped 24 ducks with VHF radio tags and searched for these ducks 1-3 times per day. We also used nine tags that automatically recorded their location every 30 min as well as acceleration in three dimensions every 2-5 min. These methods yielded information on the activity of the duck with a high temporal resolution both day and night. The 24 ducks were strongly linked to water, and 97% of all localisations were within 50 m of a water body. An affinity to settlements was only observed in the vicinity of the main lake in the area, but not for those ducks on smaller water bodies or fields. Some individuals were very stationary, using only a small area during the study period; others made daily commuting flights between two sites about 8 km apart while still others moved around similar distances but in varying directions. Rain and increasing wind speed correlated with decreasing movement activity. However, the effect of these weather parameters, and especially that of temperature, varied between individuals. Activity was strongly influenced by the sun's movement, with general activity and flight activity being highest around sunrise and sunset. This daily pattern was similar for all individuals. Hence, while the activity pattern was similar for all individuals, the resulting degree of local movements and the response to changing weather parameters were very variable among individuals.					; Fiedler, Wolfgang/AAG-4510-2021	Fiedler, Wolfgang/0000-0003-1082-4161; 													2193-7192	2193-7206				JUL	2012	153	3					713	726		10.1007/s10336-011-0788-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-011-0788-9													WOS:000305232700011

Statewide Assessment Reveals Spatiotemporal Variability of Iron in Iowa Lakes	JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY WATER RESEARCH & EDUCATION												The micronutrient iron has been noted to play a crucial role in regulating phytoplankton growth; however, most studies have focused on large lakes with persistent phytoplankton blooms that are known to undergo iron limitation, such as Lake Erie. Iron abundance in boreal lakes is also known to correlate with dissolved organic carbon and increased iron concentrations causing "browning." To assess the spatial distribution of dissolved Fe (DFe) in lakes throughout Iowa, a landscape once dominated by prairies, DFe was measured in surface waters of 124 lakes distributed across the state over the 2018 summer season. Thirty lakes were selected for 15 weeks of weekly DFe monitoring to assess temporal trends over the summer season. Dissolved Fe concentrations in surface waters ranged from 5 to 1000 mu g L-1. Iowan lakes exhibited temporal trends in DFe, with decreasing concentrations from May to mid-July and an increase into August. Unsupervised learning method (k-means) identified three main groups of lakes based on temporal DFe trends. In this study, surface water temperature was associated with DFe trends in some lakes. This study serves as a baseline for DFe in Iowa's lakes and can provide insights into iron biogeochemical cycling and its role in phytoplankton blooms, which are important to ecosystem and public health.

The strain, IT-7254, used thiosulfate and elemental sulfur as electron donors, oxygen and nitrate as electron accepters, and acetate and other organic compounds as carbon sources, After a few days of growth in the presence of thiosulfate, this strain formed sulfur globules. Comparison of intracellular enzymes and heme proteins of heterotrophically and mixotrophically grown cells showed some differences. The new isolate belonged to Thermus scotoductus because the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene sequence analysis showed 98.6% sequence similarity and 84% DNA:DNA reassociation to Thermos scotoductus NMX2 A.1. It is also close to Thermus antranikianii HN3-7, with 98.3% and 79% SSU rRNA sequence similarity and DNA:DNA reassociation, respectively. It was also found that both Thermus NMX2 A.1 and T. antranikianii HN3-7 were able to oxidize thiosulfate but that the T. scotoductus type strain SE-1 was not. This is the first report of Thermus strains that are capable of mixotrophic growth with sulfur oxidation.

Mammalian metabolic rates in the hottest fish on earth	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The Magadi tilapia, Alcolapia grahami, a small cichlid fish of Lake Magadi, Kenya lives in one of themost challenging aquatic environments on earth, characterized by very high alkalinity, unusual water chemistry, and extreme O-2, ROS, and temperature regimes. In contrast to most fishes which live at temperatures substantially lower than the 36-40 degrees C of mammals and birds, an isolated population (South West Hot Springs, SWHS) of Magadi tilapia thrives in fast-flowing hotsprings with daytime highs of 43 degrees C and night-time lows of 32 degrees C. Another population (Fish Springs Lagoon, FSL) lives in a lagoon with fairly stable daily temperatures (33-36 degrees C). The upper critical temperatures (Ct(max)) of both populations are very high; moreover the SWHS tilapia exhibit the highest Ctmax (45.6 degrees C) ever recorded for a fish. Routine rates of O-2 consumption (MO2) measured on site, together with MO2 and swimming performance at 25, 32, and 39 degrees C in the laboratory, showed that the SWHS tilapia exhibited the greatest metabolic performance ever recorded in a fish. These rates were in the basal range of a small mammal of comparable size, and were all far higher than in the FSL fish. The SWHS tilapia represents a bellwether organism for global warming.

Organic micropollutant removal from wastewater effluent-impacted drinking water sources during bank filtration and artificial recharge	WATER RESEARCH												Natural treatment systems such as bank filtration (BF) and artificial recharge (via an infiltration basin) are a robust barrier for many organic micropollutants (OMPs) and may represent a low-cost alternative compared to advanced drinking water treatment systems. This study analyzes a comprehensive database of OMPs at BF and artificial recharge (AR) sites located near Lake Tegel in Berlin (Germany). The focus of the study was on the derivation of correlations between the removal efficiencies of OMPs and key factors influencing the performance of BF and AR. At the BF site, shallow monitoring wells located close to the Lake Tegel source exhibited oxic conditions followed by prolonged anoxic conditions in deep monitoring wells and a production well. At the AR site, oxic conditions prevailed from the recharge pond along monitoring wells to the production well. Long residence times of up to 4.5 months at the BF site reduced the temperature variation during soil passage between summer and winter. The temperature variations were greater at the AR site as a consequence of shorter residence times. Deep monitoring wells and the production well located at the BF site were under the influence of ambient groundwater and old bank filtrate (up to several years of age). Thus, it is important to account for mixing with native groundwater and other sources (e.g., old bank filtrate) when estimating the performance of BF with respect to removal of OMPs. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to investigate correlations between OMP removals and hydrogeochemical conditions with spatial and temporal parameters (e.g., well distance, residence time and depth) from both sites. Principal component-1 (PC1) embodied redox conditions (oxidation-reduction potential and dissolved oxygen), and principal component-2 (PC2) embodied degradation potential (e.g., total organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon) with the calcium carbonate dissolution potential (Ca(2+) and HCO(3)(-)) for the BF site. These two PCs explained a total variance of 55% at the BF site. At the AR site, PCA revealed redox conditions (PC1) and degradation potential with temperature (PC2) as principal components, which explained a total variance of 56%. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Mueller, GA				Mueller, GA			Predatory fish removal and native fish recovery in the Colorado River mainstem: What have we learned?	FISHERIES												Mechanical predator removal programs have gained popularity in the United States and have benefited the recovery of several native trout and spring fish. These successes have been limited to headwater streams and small, isolated ponds or springs. Nevertheless, these same approaches are being applied to large river systems on the belief that any degree of predator removal will somehow benefit natives. This attitude is prevalent in the Colorado River mainstem where recovery and conservation programs are struggling to reverse the decline of four endangered fish species. Predator removal and prevention are major thrusts of that work but unfortunately, after 10 years and the removal of > 1.5 million predators, we have yet to see a positive response from the native fish community. This leads to the obvious question: is mechanical removal or control in large (> 100 cfs base flow) western streams technically or politically feasible? If not, recovery for some mainstem fishes may not be practical in the conventional sense, but require innovative management strategies to prevent their extirpation or possible extinction. This article examines (1) what has been attempted, (2) what has worked, and (3) what has not worked in the Colorado River mainstem and provides recommendations for future efforts in this critical management area.																			0363-2415					SEP	2005	30	9					10	19		10.1577/1548-8446(2005)30[10:PFRANF]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8446(2005)30[10:PFRANF]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000231777700008

J	Goodman-Elgar, M				Goodman-Elgar, Melissa			The devolution of mudbrick: ethnoarchaeology of abandoned earthen dwellings in the Bolivian Andes	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE												This ethno-geoarchaeological study considers the formation of archaeological deposits through a study of abandoned contemporary mudbrick structures on the Taraco Peninsula, Bolivia. The study site was a domestic compound with rooms for different functions that had been abandoned for over 50 years. Structures were in variable states of decay in terms of roof cover, walling integrity and abandonment fills. Geoarchaeological samples were collected from intact and weathered adobes, earthen hearths, mud plaster, and flooring. Adobes and mud plaster were locally derived from topsoil containing archaeological sediments with added gravel and plant temper. This study found a relatively light anthropogenic signature for decayed earthen houses. Rising damp exfoliated mud plaster despite un-mortared cobble wall foundations. Organic matter from roof fall attracted thriving soil faunal populations, which furthered site destruction through bioturbation, particularly packed earth floors. Sediments derived from weathered mudbrick retained little evidence of prior use as construction materials unless exposed to heat. Sediments exposed to high-temperatures produced the most distinctive rubified features but were structurally compromised. Isolated thermal features from decomposed adobe would not be distinguishable from other hearth types. Adobes exposed to low or moderate heat had few distinctive features in thin section. Intact adobes and floors that were not exposed to heat have fewer pores than natural sediments and distinctive grass inclusions. These adobes disarticulated into loose sediments when exposed to weathering. Adobe fall outside the crumbling structures blended into topsoil. This study sheds light on functional attributes of pre-Columbian construction practices. Thick, fine-textured sterile flooring is commonly encountered in the study region. This Would control bioturbation from roof fall in a previous occupation enabling reconstruction in abandoned dwellings. In contrast to the contemporary dwelling, prehistoric mortared cobble foundations would resist rising damp. Cobbles without mortar may relate more to design and construction than durability. These contrasts between contemporary and prehistory construction practices reflect differences in the design, construction costs and functional use-life of adobe structures. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The percentage of airborne bacteria was markedly higher than that of fungi, and the concentrations of bacteria were much higher in a densely populated area (Guangzhou Medical College) than in a clean area (Guangzhou Liuhua Lake Park) or one with heavy traffic (Dongfengxilu Road). Moreover, the concentrations of bacteria at 8:00 and 23:00 were higher than those at 12:00 and 17:00. Sixteen species of bacteria belonging to eight genera were identified, and all were opportunistic pathogens. Of these, 11 species from four genera were Gram-positive, and five species from four genera were Gram-negative. Staphylococcus, Bacillus, Enterobacter, and Serratia were the dominant bacterial genera, and the most abundant species were Staphylococcus hominis (8-58%) and Staphylococcus lugdunensis (14 to 35%). Size distribution studies showed that 36 to 76% of the microorganisms deposited on stages 3 to 6 of the sampler (0.65-4.7 mu m aerodynamic equivalent diameter), and particles of this size could penetrate the lower respiratory tract of humans.

Terrestrial sites there offer the potential for well-dated, high-resolution, continuous records of environmental change and/or glacier activity. Laminated sediments from the proglacial lake Hvitarvatn provide a continuous record of environmental change and the development of the adjacent Langjokull ice cap for the past 10.2 ka. Replicate lake sediment cores, collected from multiple locations in the basin, are placed in a secure geochronology by splicing a varve chronology for the past 3 ka with a tephra-constrained, paleomagnetic secular variation derived chronology for older sediments. Multiple proxies, including sedimentation rate, bulk density, ice-rafted debris, sediment organic matter, biogenic silica, and diatom abundance, allow annual to multi-decadal resolution and reveal a dynamic Holocene terrestrial climate. Following regional deglaciation of the main Iceland Ice Sheet, summer temperatures were high enough that mountain ice caps had already melted, or were contributing insignificant sediment to the lake. Pronounced increases in sedimentation rate, sediment density, and the influx of terrestrial organic matter, between 8.7 and 7.9 ka suggest early Holocene warmth was interrupted by two distinct pulses of cold summers leading to widespread landscape destabilization and possibly glacier growth. The Holocene thermal maximum (HTM; 7.9 to 5.5 ka) was characterized by high within-lake productivity and ice-free conditions in the watershed. Neoglaciation is recorded as a non-linear transition toward cooler summers, landscape destabilization, and the inception and expansion of Langjokull beginning ca 5.5 ka, with notable increases in ice cap size and landscape instability at 4.2 and 3.0 ka. The past two millennia are characterized by the abrupt onset of sustained cold periods at ca 550 and 1250 AD, separated by an interval of relative warmth from ca 950 to 1150 AD. The greatest Holocene extent of Langjokull occurred in the nineteenth century and is coincident with peak landscape instability, followed by ice recession throughout the twentieth century.

J	Blenckner, T; Chen, DL				Blenckner, T; Chen, DL			Comparison of the impact of regional and North Atlantic atmospheric circulation on an aquatic ecosystem	CLIMATE RESEARCH												Atmospheric circulation is important in affecting surface climate and ecosystems. In this study, we compared the impact of North Atlantic and regional atmospheric circulation, as represented by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index and a set of regional circulation indices on local air and water temperature, ice phenology and the phytoplankton spring bloom in a Swedish lake. All these variables were significantly correlated to both circulation indices, except for the water temperature due to the insulation effects of ice and snow cover. These relationships were more powerful using the regional circulation indices, implying that the regional indices explained the variability of the lake variables with a higher power compared with the NAO index. Additionally, the application of regional indices allowed the determination of underlying processes. For example, the timing of the ice break-up could be explained with 73 % by the regional index associated with total wind speed from January to March. This example suggests that regional circulation indices are very useful tools, in addition to global circulation, to improve the understanding of the interaction between ecosystem processes and climate.

Sr-85-labelled individuals constituted 96% of the 0+year pike catch from late summer electrofishing in the stocked littoral areas of the heavily regulated Lokka Reservoir. The density of 0+year pike reached 2.1 individuals 100 m(-2) in the stocked areas in comparison to 0.3 individuals 100 m(-2) in the reference areas. In the three other stocked lakes the proportion of labelled pike in the catch ranged from 0 to 42% in late summer. The results suggest that pike stockings are profitable in filling empty or nearly empty 0+year pike habitats of regulated lakes or other waterbodies, where the natural reproduction of pike has declined due to human activities.

This study presents new high-resolution (similar to 25 years) records of elements and stable isotopes of <38-mu m calcites from a sediment core from Dali Lake in order to investigate the climatic change in the EASM margin at the last glacial-interglacial transition. The <38-mu m calcites in the Dali Lake sediments are cubical or rhombohedral, implying that they are predominated by endogenic calcites precipitated within the water body of the lake. High values of Ca and Mg concentrations of the endogenic calcites are interpreted as strong evaporation and low dissolved CO2 concentration of the lake water related to high regional temperature. Concurrent increases in C-13 and O-18 values of the endogenic calcites are interpreted as the result of intensified evaporation associated with high temperature or low precipitation in the region. These data indicate that the climate in the Dali Lake region was relatively warm and wet from 15,500 to 12,800 and from 11,550 to 10,000 cal. yr BP, and cold and dry from 12,800 to 11,550 cal. yr BP, which was generally supported by the evidence from the data of sedimentary organic matter from the same sediment core. In addition, the abruptness of the temperature change in the Dali Lake region from 12,800 to 11,550 cal. yr BP could be corresponded, within age uncertainties, to the YD cold reversal occurring over northern high latitudes. The atmospheric coupling between the North Atlantic region and the EASM margin was proposed as the dominant pattern influencing the climatic change in the Dali Lake region during the YD event.

Impacts of microtopographic snow redistribution and lateral subsurface processes on hydrologic and thermal states in an Arctic polygonal ground ecosystem: a case study using ELM-3D v1.0	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												Microtopographic features, such as polygonal ground, are characteristic sources of landscape heterogeneity in the Alaskan Arctic coastal plain. Here, we analyze the effects of snow redistribution (SR) and lateral subsurface processes on hydrologic and thermal states at a polygonal tundra site near Barrow, Alaska. We extended the land model integrated in the E3SM to redistribute incoming snow by accounting for microtopography and incorporated subsurface lateral transport of water and energy (ELM-3D v1.0). Multiple 10-year-long simulations were performed for a transect across a polygonal tundra landscape at the Barrow Environmental Observatory in Alaska to isolate the impact of SR and subsurface process representation. When SR was included, model predictions better agreed (higher R-2, lower bias and RMSE) with observed differences in snow depth between polygonal rims and centers. The model was also able to accurately reproduce observed soil temperature vertical profiles in the polygon rims and centers (overall bias, RMSE, and R-2 of 0.59 degrees C, 1.82 degrees C, and 0.99, respectively). The spatial heterogeneity of snow depth during the winter due to SR generated surface soil temperature heterogeneity that propagated in depth and time and led to similar to 10 cm shallower and similar to 5 cm deeper maximum annual thaw depths under the polygon rims and centers, respectively. Additionally, SR led to spatial heterogeneity in surface energy fluxes and soil moisture during the summer. Excluding lateral subsurface hydrologic and thermal processes led to small effects on mean states but an overestimation of spatial variability in soil moisture and soil temperature as subsurface liquid pressure and thermal gradients were artificially prevented from spatially dissipating over time. The effect of lateral subsurface processes on maximum thaw depths was modest, with mean absolute differences of similar to 3 cm. Our integration of three-dimensional subsurface hydrologic and thermal subsurface dynamics in the E3SM land model will facilitate a wide range of analyses heretofore impossible in an ESM context.

For example, disease outbreaks may happen on the breeding grounds, the wintering grounds, or during migration and are expected to accelerate under climate change. The ability to identify the geographic origins of impacted individuals, especially outside of breeding areas, might make it possible to predict demographic trends and inform conservation decision-making. However, such an effort is made more challenging by the degraded state of carcasses and resulting low quality of DNA available. Here, we describe a rapid and low-cost approach for identifying the origins of birds sampled across their annual cycle that is robust even when DNA quality is poor. We illustrate the approach in the common loon (Gavia immer), an iconic migratory aquatic bird that is under increasing threat on both its breeding and wintering areas. Using 300 samples collected from across the breeding range, we develop a panel of 158 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) loci with divergent allele frequencies across six genetic subpopulations. We use this SNP panel to identify the breeding grounds for 142 live nonbreeding individuals and carcasses. For example, genetic assignment of loons sampled during botulism outbreaks in parts of the Great Lakes provides evidence for the significant role the lakes play as migratory stopover areas for loons that breed across wide swaths of Canada, and highlights the vulnerability of a large segment of the breeding population to botulism outbreaks that are occurring in the Great Lakes with increasing frequency. Our results illustrate that the use of SNP panels to identify breeding origins of carcasses collected during the nonbreeding season can improve our understanding of the population-specific impacts of mortality from disease and anthropogenic stressors, ultimately allowing more effective management.					; Sorenson, Michael/D-8065-2011; , Tom Smtih/JXX-5281-2024	Larison, Brenda/0000-0002-0264-7276; Sorenson, Michael/0000-0001-5375-2917; 													1752-4571					JUN	2021	14	6					1646	1658		10.1111/eva.13231	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eva.13231		APR 2021						34178110					WOS:000638597300001

The plot soils were acidic iron podzols (sensu Kubiena), with a significant content of secondary aluminium (Al), forming a potential major source of toxic Al in streams and lakes. Rain and mist inputs contain small amounts of anthropogenic sulphate, with ammonium inputs being enhanced during the summer months. Vegetation canopy interactions, including sorption and leaching, change input water chemistry before it reaches the soil, in which organic interactions increase, especially during the summer. Amphibole in the soil parent material is probably responsible for the large mineral weathering rate determined and this source of base cations, allied with the small anthropogenic inputs, results in Al concentrations in the streamwater being small in comparison with impacted sites.

This assumption may be violated if individuals in poor body condition are disproportionately vulnerable to hunting. Thus, we used body mass and band-recovery data from 1,412 mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) trapped at Lake St. Clair, Ontario, during August-September of 1989 and 1990 to test the hypothesis that individuals in relatively poor condition before the hunting season subsequently are at a disproportionately high risk of being shot. Supporting this hypothesis, binary regression analysis revealed negative relationships (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) between preseason condition (body mass corrected for structural size) and direct recovery probability in 3 of 8 separate analyses (by year, sex, and age), and overall. Our data support the position that condition biases may be widespread in hunter-shot samples of waterfowl, indicating a need for caution when using band-recovery data to estimate hunting mortality and other recovery-based parameters.																			0022-541X					APR	1993	57	2					209	215		10.2307/3809415	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3809415													WOS:A1993LA01200002

Tundra and boreal forest of interior Alaska during terminal MIS 6 and MIS 5e	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY												Two sites within the boreal forest of interior Alaska shed light on the climate and vegetation of terminal marine isotope stage (MIS) 6 (ca. 140-130 kyr ago) and MIS 5e (125-116 kyr ago). The Birch Creek and Koyukuk localities are river-cut exposures with sediments dating from the penultimate glaciation (at least) to the present. Plant macrofossils, pollen, and beetles were analyzed at these sites. Terminal MIS 6-aged samples indicate a cooler than modern climate and the presence of shrub tundra. During MIS 5e, boreal forest grew at the sites and temperatures were similar to modern times. However, the forest may also have been more mesic than today, as indicated by relatively abundant ferns. Winters may have been warmer than today, as suggested by beetle-based climatic reconstructions as well as the presence of two extralimital taxa that today live in regions where winter temperatures are up to 15 A degrees C warmer than at the site localities.

The estimates of discharge, flow depth, and flow velocity are derived from remotely observed water surface area, water surface slope, and water surface height, and demonstrated for two reaches of the Yukon River in Alaska, at Eagle (reach length 34.7 km) and near Stevens Village (reach length 38.3 km). The method is based on fundamental equations of hydraulic flow resistance in rivers, including the Manning equation and the Prandtl-von Karman universal velocity distribution equation. The method employs some new hydraulic relations to help define flow resistance and height of the zero flow boundary in the channel. Estimates are made both with and without calibration. The water surface area of the river reach is measured by using a provisional version of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat based product named Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWE). The water surface height and slope measurements require a self-consistent datum, and are derived from observations from the Jason-2 satellite altimeter mission. At both reach locations, the Jason-2 radar altimeter non-winter heights consistently tracked the stage recorded at USGS streamgages with a standard deviation of differences (error) during the non-winter periods of less than 7%. Part of the error may be due to differences in the gage and altimeter crossing locations with respect to the range of stage change and the response to changes in discharge at the upstream and downstream locations. For the non winter periods, the radar derived slope estimates (mean = 0.0003) were constant over the mission lifetime, and in agreement with previously measured USGS water surface slopes and slopes determined from USGS topographic maps. The accuracy of the mean of the uncalibrated daily estimates of discharge varied between reaches, ranging from 13% near Stevens Village (N = 90) to 21% at Eagle (N = 246) based on the absolute error, and 5% to 6% based on the error of the log of the estimates. Calibrating to the mean of USGS daily discharge estimates from the streamflow rating for the same period of record at each streamgage resulted in mean absolute errors ranging from 1% to 2%, and log errors ranging from 1% or less. The error pattern of the estimates shows that without calibration, even though the mean is well simulated, the high and low end values over the range of estimates may have significant bias.					; Garambois, Pierre-Andre/I-5612-2019; Rover, Jennifer/AAB-3509-2021	Jones, John/0000-0001-6117-3691; Fulton, John/0000-0002-5335-0720; Rover, Jennifer/0000-0002-3437-4030; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				JUN	2018	561						1000	1018		10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.04.005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.04.005													WOS:000439401800076

This reservoir has its basin located mainly in a mountain area,affected by the organic, physical, and residue pollution from an old pyrite mine. From September 2006 through November 2007 samples were collected at meter intervals from the surface to bottom near water withdrawal site. The reservoir was polymictic during wet summers, and monomictic during dry summers. During thermal stratification it had a clinograde oxygen distribution pattern, a pH between 7.0 and 8.1 and a negative hypolimnetic Eh during thermal stratification. We derived an empiric model relating Eh, DO and T. The correlations between the studied indicators were also determined. These results will facilitate the interpretation of highly complex phenomena such as the release nutrients, metals, and organic matter from the sediments.																			0213-8409					JUN	2009	28	1					23	33																WOS:000267630800004

Spatial segregation and habitat partitioning of bobcat and Canada lynx	FACETS												Harvest records suggest that the abundance of bobcats (Lynx rufus) has increased and the leading edge of their distribution has spread northward, while the trailing edge of the Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) range has contracted in Ontario, Canada. There has been a debate about whether these closely related felids might compete in areas of sympatry, but there is little research on sympatric populations of bobcat and lynx. Both species are found on the north shore of Lake Huron in Ontario, Canada, which provided an opportunity to investigate their spatial patterns and habitat use. We surveyed snowmobile routes for snow tracks over three winters and estimated probability of occupancy for the two felid species while accounting for detectability. Bobcat and lynx tracks were never found on the same survey route. Bobcat occupancy increased with habitat heterogeneity, whereas lynx occupancy increased with homogeneity. Our results fit with the common assumption of the generalist and specialist natures of bobcat and lynx, respectively. Our findings suggest that bobcats invaded former lynx territory after these areas became vacant. The story of the bobcat and the lynx is one of the loss of a unique, boreal specialist due to anthropogenic change, and eventual replacement by an adaptable generalist.

Utilization was estimated from the decrease of DC-AA and DFAA concentrations in 1-mum filtrates and compared to the C demand for the net production of bacterial biomass measured from the increase of bacterial abundance. During the phytoplankton spring bloom and the clear-water phase, DFAA accounted for 30-48% and DCAA 5-62% of the bacterial C demand. From August until November use of DFAA comprised <5% and DCAA 50-148% of the bacterial C demand. In aphotic depths, amino acids accounted for a higher fraction of the C demand relative to euphotic depths. From mid-july until early September use of DCAA exceeded the bacterial C and N demand, leading to release of ammonium. During the spring bloom and the clearwater phase, DFAA + DCAA accounted for <100% of bacterial C demand, suggesting that other substrates were also used. Concentrations and utilization rates of DFAA covaried, whereas maxima of DCAA use followed maxima of DCAA concentration with a time-lag of several weeks. Measurements of the extracellular isotope dilution of [H-3]amino acids indicated that after the diatom bloom, bacterial hydrolysis and use of DCAA were closely coupled and release of DFAA accounted for <7% of the DCAA used. During this time, turnover of the DFAA pool could be explained on the basis of release and utilization. Our results show that DCAA and DFAA are important substrates for the growth of planktonic bacteria in the lake.																			0024-3590					NOV	1993	38	7					1521	1531		10.4319/lo.1993.38.7.1521	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1993.38.7.1521													WOS:A1993MR97500014
J	SMITH, MW				SMITH, MW			FERTILIZATION AND PREDATOR CONTROL TO IMPROVE TROUT ANGLING IN NATURAL LAKES	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												A significantly faster growth rate by native and planted eastern brook trout followed the addition of commercial fertilizers in sufficient quantities to provide potential additional concentrations of 0.39 mg P, 0.21 mg N and 0.27 mg K per 1 in Crecy Lake (20.4 ha; mean depth, 2.4 m), New Brunswick. Largely because trout planted as fingerlings attained suitable angling size when yearlings, the rate of capture and the yield by weight to anglers approximately doubled. The improved growth rate, but not yields, persisted into the second and third years after fertilization. Coincident was an increase in predation by fish-eating birds and mammals. With predator control and the same stocking rates, the yield of trout flesh produced in the lake increased from 0.9 to 5.9 kg/ha over the next two-year period. With predator control extended to trapping eels in the lake, a second comparable fertilization with respect to concentrations of P, N and K, and a doubling of the stocking rate, a yield of 9.7 kg/ha was realized. The growth rate was somewhat depressed with the heavier stocking, notwithstanding a second fertilization. Facilities for natural reproduction were poor and planted trout (fingerlings and yearlings) sustained the fishery. Maximum survivals of planted trout (all marked) to anglers'' catches were 20% for fingerlings and 88% for yearlings. Cropping of trout of age II was thorough. For the most part, movements of planted trout (trapped in outlet) from the lake would have occasioned minor losses. Neighbouring Gibson Lake (24.0 ha; mean depth, 4.0 m) was fertilized with one-half of the concentrations of P, N and K applied in Crecy. Stocking with trout was at comparable rates but no predator control was exercised. Little improvement was noted in the growth of the trout. Only when yearlings were planted late in the fall and angled early in the spring was there any improvement in the anglers'' catches.																									1955	12	2					210	237		10.1139/f55-015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f55-015													WOS:A1955WZ51200002

The results reveal that, the FOPE over the longitudinal range of 110 degrees-130 degrees E, near the Stanovoy Mountains and the Okhotsk Sea, is significantly correlated with precipitation over the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLRYR) during summer, particularly in August. The preceding full July (or 1-20 July) mean Balkhash Lake-Caucasus geopotential height index, which measures the combined effect of the Balkhash Lake and Caucasus geopotential height anomalies, is closely related to the August geopotential height anomaly around the Stanovoy Mountains and the Okhotsk Sea, and can therefore reflect the August 110 degrees-130 degrees E FOPE. The predictability based on this preceding atmospheric signal seems to be attributable to slow-varying atmospheric processes on a subseasonal (20-day mean) time scale. On this time scale, the Balkhash Lake and Caucasus geopotential height anomalies occur prior to, and seem to modulate, the geopotential height anomaly around the Stanovoy Mountains and the associated 110 degrees-130 degrees E FOPE through an eastward extension and through exciting a positive-negative-positive pattern in 500-hPa geopotential heights, respectively. As a result of the slow-varying atmospheric processes, this preceding atmospheric signal performs well in predicting the August 110 degrees-130 degrees E FOPE, which also facilitates the prediction of the MLRYR precipitation.

CHANGES IN RESPONSE INDICES AS A FUNCTION OF TIME IN WINTER WHEAT	JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION												Nitrogen (N) responsiveness of crops can change with time as it is strongly influenced by in-season environmental conditions. This study was conducted to determine the relationship of N responsiveness using a response index (RI) as a function of time at five locations (Efaw, Stillwater, Lake Carl Blackwell, Perkins and Lahoma, Oklahoma) over a three-year period. Subplots of 4 m2 were established at each experimental site that employed a randomized complete block design. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) readings were taken using a Greenseeker (NTech Industries, Inc., Ukiah, CA, USA) handheld sensor at various growth stages. The N responsiveness (RINDVI) was determined as the ratio of NDVI readings from a non-N limiting strip and the farmer practice. Then, RI was plotted against days where growing degree days (GDD = (Tmin + Tmax)/24.4 degrees C) were zero (DGDD 0). At all sites, RINDVI increased with advancing stage of growth. Excluding Perkins 2005 and Stillwater 2006, the relationship between RINDVI and DGDD 0 was positive and highly correlated. When the number of days from planting to sensing where DGDD 0 was less than 60, it is unlikely that a reliable estimate of RINDVI could be obtained since values were all small (close to 1.0), consistent with limited growth at the early stages of growth. Averaged over years and sites for all growth stages, the correlation of RINDVI and RIHarvest was positive and increased up to the Feekes 9 growth stage. Our results further suggested that once RINDVI is collected, it should be adjusted using the Equation RINDVIadj = RINDVI x [1.87/(DGDD 0 * 0.00997) + 0.5876].

The phytoplankton community of this lake was largely dominated by this diatom, which formed 80-95% of the phytoplankton biomass in the meta- and hypolimnion during the study period. Sedimentation of living Melosira was observed; 40-60% of the cells reaching the hypolimnion were viable. The spatial and temporal changes of the biochemical composition of this community suggest that Melosira utilized reserve products during sedimentation, essentially carbohydrates and secondarily also lipids. The increase of the protein/carbohydrate ratio with depth and a stable adenylate energy charge level clearly showed the prevalence of catabolic over anabolic reactions for the cells leaving the euphotic zone. Assays of inorganic carbon incorporation into macromolecules suggest that the settling Melosira adapt to the changing environmental conditions by increasing the synthesis of rapidly catabolisable polymers (polysaccharides and lipids) and by decreasing synthesis of proteins and incorporation into low mol. wt compounds.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				MAY	1990	12	3					645	660		10.1093/plankt/12.3.645	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/12.3.645													WOS:A1990DB70400014

This study was performed in 15 watercourses situated in NW Poland in 2014-2015. Characteristics of the age stages were determined on the basis of 728 modules and phenological data were collected from permanent plots. In the study area, the plant appeared in week 12 of the calendar year, when water temperature in the streams was 5.4 +/- 0.16 degrees C. At that time, the first leafy juvenile shoots developed from winter buds. In week 22 (water temperature 13.9 +/- 0.85 degrees C), juvenile shoots became mature, whereas the first flowers were formed in week 24 (15.6 +/- 1.04 degrees C). The generative phase lasted twelve weeks with water temperature from 15.6 +/- 1.04 degrees C to 18.9 +/- 3.23 degrees C. Between weeks 37 and 44 (water temperature from 13.7 +/- 0.77 degrees C to 6.3 +/- 1.05 degrees C), senile shoots dominated in the population. From week 45 until week 11 of the next year (water temperature < 5.4 +/- 0.16 degrees C), the plants were in the winter resting stage. In our view, climate warming might disturb the phenology of P. alpinus, decreasing the probability of sexual reproduction of the species and the phenological distance between the Central European Plain and the Scandinavian populations.					; Chmara, Rafał/ABF-2811-2020	Szmeja, Jozef/0000-0002-1834-9468; Chmara, Rafal/0000-0002-9267-5085; BANAS, KRZYSZTOF/0000-0002-2131-8400; Robionek-Selosse, Alicja/0000-0002-6865-7901; 													1730-413X	1897-3191				MAR	2018	47	1					41	49		10.1515/ohs-2018-0005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/ohs-2018-0005													WOS:000427681400005
J	Sullivan, TP; Sullivan, DS; Reid, DG; Leung, MC				Sullivan, TP; Sullivan, DS; Reid, DG; Leung, MC			Weasels, voles, and trees: Influence of mustelid semiochemicals on vole populations and feeding damage	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The role of predators, particularly small mustelids, in regulating vole (Microtus spp.) populations has been the subject of much scientific inquiry over the past several decades. From a management perspective, voles cause economic damage by feeding on seedlings planted on cutover forest land in temperate and boreal zones. Because of the close relationship between small weasels (Mustela erminea and M. nivalis) and voles, could the indirect effect of weasel scent disrupt vole populations and reduce their damage to forest plantations? This study was designed to test the hypotheses that synthetic weasel odor would: (1) reduce abundance, reproduction, survival, and movement of montane (Microtus montanus) and meadow (M. pennsylvanicus) vole populations; (2) enhance the activity of small weasels; and (3) reduce feeding damage by voles to tree seedlings. Study areas were located near Summerland and Gavin Lake in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Vole populations were intensively live-trapped on replicate sites from April 1994 to May 1995 during a peak year in abundance. Synthetic weasel odor was continually present on treatment sites from early summer 1994 to spring 1995. Weasel activity was measured by the number of individuals captured in live-traps and by the number of snow tracks on control and treatment sites. Overwinter mortality to planted lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) seedlings from vole feeding was measured on all sites in May 1995. Mean vole abundance (n = 4) was similar between control (32-121 voles/ha) and treatment (37-118 voles/ha) sites. Montane voles declined by 17-36% on treatment sites during early Summer when trappability of this species declined dramatically at Surnmerland. This pattern was not observed for meadow voles at Gavin Lake. Recruitment of new voles was generally similar between control and treatment sites. Weasel odor had no effect on reproduction, in terms of number of successful pregnancies and index of early juvenile survival, or on total survival, movements, or body mass of voles. Activity of small weasels appeared to be higher on treatment than control sites at Gavin Lake. Weasel odor did not reduce mortality of tree seedlings caused by vole feeding. This study is the first investigation of the population responses of free-living voles to synthetic odor of the short-tailed weasel, a principal predator of Microtus spp. Our results demonstrate that by the time voles have reached highs densities, it is too late to reduce numbers or curtail feeding damage, regardless of weasel odor-induced antipredatory behavior or enhanced activity of predators. Application of weasel odor during the low phase of the vole population cycle would be a critical test of the hypothesis that small mustelids could lengthen the period of low vole numbers and potentially protect forest plantations from vole damage.																			1051-0761					AUG	2004	14	4					999	1015		10.1890/02-5284	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/02-5284													WOS:000223156600005

Comparison of growth and survival of sea-run and landlocked strains of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar in the Lake Ontario watershed	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In managing Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, New York fisheries agencies have historically stocked both landlocked and sea-run strains. The objective of this study was to compare young-of-year survival and growth among a variety of strains in both the laboratory and in streams. Atlantic salmon fry of four strains (sea-run: Merrimack River and Penobscot River; landlocked: West Grand Lake and Lake Memphremagog) were stocked for four years in five central New York streams. Laboratory experiments compared growth rates at six temperatures (12, 15, 18, 20, 23, and 25 degrees C) experienced in New York streams during the summer. Comparisons among monthly survival and specific growth rates at all stream sites and years resulted in no obvious trends; survival ranged from 0 to 81% and growth rates were between 0.02 and 0.04 g.g(-1).d(-1). There were no significant differences in growth or survival observed between sea-run versus landlocked strains. Within the five study streams, the Lake Memphremagog strain had the highest growth rates, while growth rates were similar in the laboratory between Lake Memphremagog and Merrimack River strains. Based on laboratory and field assessments, Atlantic salmon specific growth rate was greatest at approximately 18 degrees C during the summer months. Future research in Lake Ontario should include further assessment of the Lake Memphremagog strain, especially on direct tributaries with access for returning adults, as well as continuing to establish a Lake Ontario specific strain.

Many of the major tributaries to the lake are on North Carolina's 303(d) list for impaired streams, and in 2008, the lake was added to that list because of high values of turbidity, likely sourced from tributary streams. Suspended sediments were collected from four streams with a time-integrated sampler during high-flow events. In addition, composite sediment samples representing potential sources were collected from stream banks, forests, pastures, construction sites, dirt and paved roads, and road cuts within tributary basins. Radiocarbon dating and magnetic susceptibility measurements were used to determine the origin of stream bank alluvial deposits. Sediment samples were analyzed for the concentrations of 55 elements and two radionuclides in order to identify tracers capable of distinguishing between potential sediment sources. The relative sediment source contributions were determined by applying a Monte Carlo simulation that parameterized the geochemical tracer data in a mixing model. Radiocarbon and magnetic susceptibility measurements confirmed the presence of "legacy" sediment in the Ellerbe and New Light Creek valley bottoms. Mixing model results demonstrate that stream bank erosion is the largest contributor to the suspended sediment load in New Light Creek (62%), Ellerbe Creek (58%), and Little Lick Creek (33%), and is the second largest contributor in Lick Creek (27%) behind construction sites (43%). We find that stream bank erosion is the largest nonpoint source contributor to the suspended sediment load in three of the four catchments and is therefore a significant source of turbidity in Falls Lake. The presence of legacy sediment appears to coincide with increased contributions from stream bank erosion in Ellerbe and New Light creeks. Active construction sites and timber harvesting were also significant sources of suspended sediment. Water quality mitigation efforts need to consider nonpoint-source contributions from stream bank erosion of valley bottom sediments aggraded after European settlement.					; Osburn, Chris/A-9339-2010	Wegmann, Karl William/0000-0001-8489-554X; Osburn, Christopher/0000-0002-9334-4202													1439-0108	1614-7480				DEC	2013	13	10					1692	1707		10.1007/s11368-013-0758-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-013-0758-3													WOS:000326700800004

However, evidence from lacustrine records in South America suggests that tropical latitudes experienced significant water balance variability during the Holocene, rather than quiescence. For example, a tight coupling between insolation and carbonate delta 18O records from central Andean lakes (e.g., Lakes Jun & iacute;n, Pumacocha) suggest water balance is tied directly to South American summer monsoon (SASM) strength. However, lake carbonate delta 18O records also incorporate information about temperature and evaporation. To overcome this ambiguity, clumped and triple oxygen isotope records can provide independent constraints on temperature and evaporation. Here, we use clumped and triple oxygen isotopes to develop Holocene temperature and evaporation records from three central Andean lakes, Lakes Jun & iacute;n, Pumacocha, and Mehcocha, to build a more complete picture of regional water balance (P-E). We find that Holocene water temperatures at all three lakes were stable and slightly warmer than during the latest Pleistocene. These results are consistent with global data assimilations and records from the foothills and Amazon basin. In contrast, evaporation was highly variable and tracks SASM intensity. The hydrologic response of each lake to SASM depends greatly on the physical characteristics of the lake basin, but they all record peak evaporation in the early to mid-Holocene (11,700 to 4,200 years BP) when regional insolation was relatively low and the SASM was weak. These results corroborate other central Andean records and suggest synchronous, widespread water stress tracks insolation-paced variability in SASM strength. Lake carbonate Delta ' 17O and Delta 47 constrain lake temperature and water balance histories in ways that delta 18O records alone cannot resolve Carbonate Delta ' 17O records from three Andean lakes indicate that lake hydrology and regional water balance track insolation across the Holocene Low Delta ' 17O for reconstructed lake water indicates that greater evaporative conditions correspond to weakened early and mid-Holocene South American summer monsoon					; Levin, Naomi/B-4124-2010; Passey, Benjamin/F-9644-2010	DeLuca, Nicole/0000-0001-6206-7890; Katz, Sarah/0000-0001-6084-6858; Rodbell, Donald/0000-0002-9269-5967; Levin, Naomi/0000-0001-5703-3717; Abbott, Mark/0000-0002-0299-928X; 													2572-4517	2572-4525				MAY	2024	39	5							e2023PA004827	10.1029/2023PA004827	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023PA004827													WOS:001228685200001

NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												We critically evaluate the prevailing view that the species composition of zooplankton communities in New Zealand lakes, and the abundance and size distribution of the zooplankton, are more commonly controlled by food and temperature than by predation. We conclude that predation may play a far more important role than was hitherto thought. This conclusion is based first on the seasonal zooplankton dynamics of several New Zealand lakes being similar to those in Danish lakes, in which fish predation has been shown to have major effects. Second, the indigenous planktivorous fish fauna in New Zealand lakes is dominated by larvae of benthic fish with a long breeding season (bullies) and other small potent zooplanktivores such as smelt and larvae of galaxiids. Patterns of diurnal vertical migration of zooplankton in several New Zealand lakes during summer are also consistent with it being a mechanism to escape from predation. Third, the dominant piscivorous fish (brown trout and rainbow trout) are only facultative piscivores and are therefore probably weaker predators on the planktivores than the more obligate piscivores in many north-temperate lakes. Although various other explanations have been offered for the low ratio of zooplankton-to-phytoplankton biomass observed in New Zealand lakes, this phenomenon is equally consistent with high rates of predation. Re-analyses of data from earlier investigations in Tomahawk Lagoon No. 2, provide evidence for a periodically high predation pressure on zooplankton during summer, which was further supported experimentally. We call for further investigation of top-down control of zooplankton in New Zealand lakes. It is important not only for scientific understanding, but potentially also for lake management.

J	Marshall, WA; Clough, R; Gehrels, WR				Marshall, William A.; Clough, Robert; Gehrels, W. Roland			The isotopic record of atmospheric lead fall-out on an Icelandic salt marsh since AD 50	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												We report a record of atmospheric Pb deposition at a coastal site in western Iceland that spans the last two millennia. The elemental concentrations of Pb, Al, Li and Ti are determined using ICP-MS from a sediment monolith collected from a salt marsh. Multicollector (MC) ICP-MS analysis is used to obtain isotopic ratios of stable Pb. The Pb/Ti and Pb/Li ratios are used to separate natural Pb background concentrations from Pb derived from remote anthropogenic sources. The pollution record in western Iceland is subdued in comparison with Pb records from the European mainland, but the isotopic character, profile and timing of Pb deposition show good agreement with the atmospheric Pb fall-out reported from sites in Scandinavia and northwestern Europe. At the bottom of the sequence we isolate a low-level (0.1-0.4 mg kg(-1)) Pb enrichment signal dated to AD 50-150. The isotopic signature and timing of this signal suggest Roman metal working industries as the source. In the subsequent millennium there was no significant or very low (i.e. elemental concentrations <0.01 mg kg(-1)) anthropogenic Pb deposition at the site up to, and including, the early Medieval period. Above a pumice layer, dated to AD 1226-1227, a small increase in Pb deposition is found. This trend is maintained until a more substantive and progressive increase is signalled during the late 1700s and early 1800s. This is followed by a substantial enrichment signal in the sediments (>3.0 mg kg(-1)) that is interpreted as derived from industrial coal burning and metal working during the 19th and 20th centuries in northern Europe. During the late 20th century, significant fall-out from European fuel additives reached Iceland. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we report atmospheric nutrient, sulfate and spheroidal carbonaceous particle (SCP) deposition rates, based on snowpack analyses of a formerly unexplored Siberian mountain region. Then, we discuss their potential effects on lake phytoplankton biomass limitation. We estimate that the nutrient depositions observed in the late-season snowpack (40 +/- 16 mgNO(3)-Nm(-2) and 0.58 +/- 0.13 mg TP-Pm-2; TP for total phosphorous) would correspond to yearly depositions lower than 119 +/- 71 mgNO(3)-Nm(-2) yr(-1) and higher than 1.71 +/- 0.91 mg TP-Pm-2 yr(-1). These yearly deposition estimates would approximately fit the predictions of global deposition models and correspond to the very low nutrient deposition range, although they are still higher than world background values. In spite of the fact that such a low atmospheric nitrogen deposition rate would be enough to induce nitrogen limitation in unproductive mountain lakes, phosphorus deposition was also extremely low, and the resulting lake water N: P ratio was unaffected by atmospheric nutrient deposition. In the end, the studied lakes' phytoplankton appeared to be split between phosphorus and nitrogen limitation. We conclude that these pristine lakes are fragile sensitive systems exposed to the predicted climate warming, increased winter precipitation, enhanced forest fires and shifts in anthropogenic nitrogen emissions that could finally couple their water chemistry to that of atmospheric nutrient deposition and unlock temperature-inhibited responses of phytoplankton to nutrient shifts.

Distribution of branched GDGTs in surface sediments from the Colville River, Alaska: Implications for the MBT/CBT paleothermometer in Arctic marine sediments	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Significant climate fluctuations in the Arctic over the recent past, and additional predicted future temperature changes, highlight the need for high-resolution Arctic paleoclimate records. Arctic coastal environments supplied with terrigenous sediment from Arctic rivers have the potential to provide annual to subdecadal resolution records of climate variability over the last few millennia. A potential tool for paleotemperature reconstructions in these marine sediments is the revised methylation index of branched tetraethers (MBT)/cyclization ratio of branched tetraethers (CBT) proxy based on branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs). In this study, we examine the source of brGDGTs in the Colville River, Alaska, and the adjacent Simpson Lagoon and reconstruct temperatures from Simpson Lagoon sediments to evaluate the applicability of this proxy in Arctic estuarine environments. The Colville catchment soils, fluvial sediments, and estuarine sediments contain statistically similar brGDGT distributions, indicating that the brGDGTs throughout the system are soil derived with little alteration from in situ brGDGT production in the river or coastal waters. Temperatures reconstructed from the MBT/CBT indices for surface samples show good agreement with regional summer (June through September) temperatures, suggesting a seasonal bias in Arctic temperature reconstructions from the Colville system. In addition, we reconstruct paleotemperatures from an estuarine sediment core that spans the last 75years, revealing an overall warming trend in the twentieth century that is consistent with trends observed in regional instrumental records. These results support the application of this brGDGT-based paleotemperature proxy for subdecadal-scale summer temperature reconstructions in Arctic estuaries containing organic material derived from sediment-laden, episodic rivers.

An invasion record for the swimbladder nematode Anguillicoloides crassus in European eel Anguilla anguilla in a deep cold-monomictic lake, from invasion to steady state	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												This study is the first account of the establishment and development of the neozoic nematode parasite Anguillicoloides crassus in its host, the European eel Anguilla anguilla, in a deep, cold-monomictic lake. A 21 year study of A. crassus took place in Upper Lake Constance (ULC), Europe's second largest pre-alpine lake. The study included two extensive surveys, one in 1991 during the initial parasite invasion phase and the second in 2006 when the infection was well established. The subtropical swimbladder nematode A. crassus was first recorded in A. anguilla in ULC in 1989. Prevalence reached 60% in 1992 and remained at this level until 2007. In 2008, prevalence decreased to 48%. Infection intensity peaked in 1993 at a mean value of 16 adult parasites per host fish. Around 90% of all A. anguilla examined displayed swimbladder lesions, with a significant trend to increasing severity over time. Moreover, heavy swimbladder lesions were seen in c. 10% of A. anguilla ready to migrate to their spawning habitat. Both ruffe Gymnocephalus cernuus and sunfish Lepomis gibbosus serve as paratenic hosts for A. crassus in ULC. Gymnocephalus cernuus seems to be the main vector, and infection is especially frequent in spring possibly caused by reduced immune system efficacy of G. cernuus during winter. In 1991, hypochromic anaemia was prevalent in ULC A. anguilla acutely infected with A. crassus, whereas in 2006 blood values were indicative of chronic infection. The growth and survival rates of A. anguilla during their continental phase were not noticeably altered in infected fish, but damage to the swimbladder probably impairs migration potential and thus the subsequent breeding success of the oceanic phase.

J	Boyd, WS; Jehl, JR				Boyd, WS; Jehl, JR			Estimating the abundance of Eared Grebes on Mono Lake, California, by aerial photography	COLONIAL WATERBIRDS												We used an aerial photography protocol to estimate the number of fared Grebes (Podiceps nigricollis) staging on Mono Lake in the fall of 1996 and 1997. Three analytical techniques, a non-stratified and two stratified ones, generated similar abundance values for any given date. The stratified by-quartiles method resulted in the lowest percent SEs but this method and the non-stratified one are sensitive to the quantity and quality of photo coverage. The stratified-by-density method was more time/effort consuming and resulted in intermediate percent SEs but is more robust than the other methods. Total abundance differed by < 3% across consecutive days: in October, 1997, which suggests that the photo protocol is reliable. Our data indicate that a minimum of 1.5 to 1.6 million grebes were present on the lake in October of each year. When these estimates ale corrected for submerged birds, they increase to 1.8 to 2.0 million birds, confirming that Mono Lake is die most important fall staging site fbr fared Grebes in North America.																			0738-6028						1998	21	2					236	241		10.2307/1521912	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1521912													WOS:000078143800014
J	SOMMER, U				SOMMER, U			POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF 3 PLANKTONIC DIATOMS IN LAKE CONSTANCE	HOLARCTIC ECOLOGY												A population dynamics analysis for planktonic diatoms is presented that allows estimates of the net rate of increase (k), the death rate (.delta.), the sedimentation rate (.sigma.) and, in absence of grazing, the growth rate (.mu.). It requires counts of live and dead cells suspended in the euphotic part of the water column and accumulated in sedimentation traps. The application of the model is demonstrated for the 3 dominant summer diatom species in Lake Constance, Asterionella formosa Hass, Fragilaria crotonensis Kitton and Stephanodiscus binderanus Krieger. Only during the first 2 wk of the summer bloom of diatoms the loss rates were unimportant in comparison to the growth rates. Thereafter diatom population dynamics was strongly influenced by sedimentation and mortality, which sometimes led to a decrease in population density even when cell division continued at high rates. There were 2 periods of extraordinarily high death rates, which were associated in the case of A. formosa with Si depletion and in the case of F. crotensis with fungal parasitism.																			0105-9327						1984	7	3					257	261																WOS:A1984TM48400002

Six significantly different chironomid assemblage zones indicate that maximum precipitation and water depth occurred in the mid-Holocene (8270-2700 cal a BP) and the minimum period was the past 1250 years. A modern dataset of 44 lakes near Gonghai Lake was sampled to calibrate the response of chironomid assemblages to precipitation. Our results demonstrate that mean annual precipitation is the most significant environmental variable influencing modern chironomid assemblages in this monsoonal region. Maximum EASM precipitation in the mid-Holocene, indicated by chironomid assemblages in the monsoon fringe, contrasts with the early Holocene EASM maximum suggested by stalagmite delta O-18 data from southern China, but is consistent with other evidence. Our findings are compatible with the proposal that the stalagmite delta O-18 variations in southern China may not reliably reflect the evolution of EASM since the last deglaciation.

Isotopic Structure of Lake Whitefish in Lake Huron: Evidence for Regional and Local Populations Based on Resource Use	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Lake Whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis is the most commercially valuable species in Lake Huron. The fishery for this species has historically been managed based on 25 management units (17 in Canada, 8 in the USA). However, congruence between the contemporary population structure of LakeWhitefish and management units is poorly understood. We used stable isotopes of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15), food web markers that reflect patterns in resource use (i.e., prey, location, habitat), to assess the population structure of spawning-phase Lake Whitefish collected from 32 sites (1,474 fish) across Lake Huron. We found large isotopic variation among fish from different sites (ranges: delta C-13 = 10.2 parts per thousand, delta N-15 = 5.5 parts per thousand) and variable niche size and levels of overlap (standard ellipse area = 1.0-4.3 parts per thousand(2)). Lake Huron contained spawning-phase fish from four major isotopic clusters largely defined by extensive variation in delta C-13, and the isotopic composition of fish sampled was spatially structured both within and between lake basins. Based on cluster compositions, we identified six putative regional groups, some of which represented sites of high diversity (three to four clusters) and others with less (one to two clusters). Analysis of isotopic values from Lake Whitefish collected from summer feeding locations and baseline prey items showed similar isotopic variation and established spatial linkage between spawning-phase and summer fish. Our results show that summer feeding location contributes strongly to the isotopic structure we observed in spawning-phase fish. One of the regional groups we identified in northern Georgian Bay is highly distinct based on isotopic composition and possibly ecologically unique within Lake Huron. Our findings are congruent with several previous studies using different markers (genetics, mark-recapture), and we conclude that current management units are generally too small and numerous to reflect the population structure of Lake Whitefish in Lake Huron.					; Somers, Christopher/AAE-6390-2019; Simpson, Gavin/KFQ-1110-2024	Simpson, Gavin/0000-0002-9084-8413; Wissel, Bjoern/0000-0001-6312-149X; Wilson, Joanna/0000-0003-4245-1304													0275-5947	1548-8675					2017	37	1					133	148		10.1080/02755947.2016.1245225	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2016.1245225													WOS:000394648700014

Furongian (late Cambrian) brachiopods and associated conodonts from the Takaka Terrane in the Springs Junction - Maruia area, South Island, New Zealand	CAMBRO-ORDOVICIAN STUDIES V	Memoirs of the Association of Australasian Palaeontologists											The Sluice Box Formation, exposed in the Maruia - Lake Daniels - Springs Junction area at the southernmost extension of the Takaka Terrane west of the Alpine Fault in New Zealand's South Island, ranges in age from late Cambrian (early to middle Furongian) to Middle Ordovician (late Darriwilian). Linguliformean brachiopods described from Furongian exposures include Maruia castellum new genus and species, and the new species Mirilingula antipodes and Akmolina? tubulus, associated with Broeggeria sp., Experilingula sp., Notiobolus? sp. and an unnamed new species of Quadrisonia. The linguliformean brachiopods show strong biogeographic affinities to Kazakhstan, specifically the Malyi Karatau region. Conodonts from the lower Sluice Box Formation are assigned to the Furnishina quadrata-Prooneotodus muelleri assemblage, Cordylodus proavus assemblage, and the Juanognathus variabilis-Bergstroemognathus extensus assemblage. These are respectively of early to middle Furongian (Paibian to Jiangshanian) age, basal Datsonian (equivalent to the middle of the unnamed Stage 10 of latest Cambrian age), and early Floian (Early Ordovician) age.																			0810-8889		978-0-949466-43-3				2014	45						55	70																WOS:000339450700004
J	Csato, I; Kendall, CGS; Nairn, AEM; Baum, GR				Csato, I; Kendall, CGS; Nairn, AEM; Baum, GR			Sequence stratigraphic interpretations in the southern Dead Sea basin, Israel	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												A chronostratigraphic framework has been developed to date the late Tertiary and Pleistocene fill of the southern Dead Sea basin. This framework is based on a sequence stratigraphic interpretation of seismic data tied to eustatic sea-level curves. The limited biostratigraphic data available for the Dead Sea basin stratigraphy make this chronostratigraphy tentative, but nine third-order sequence boundaries have been identified and related to climatically driven lake-level falls that appear to correlate with eustatic events. In contrast, higher-order sequence boundaries were interpreted to reflect changes in both climate and local tectonics and the consequent sediment supply. The seismic stratigraphic interpretation indicates that fan-delta sediments accumulated at the southern and northern ends of the basin, while lacustrine elastic sediments filled the rest, Interfingering of southern and northern source sediments has been recognized in the northern part of the basin. The changing position of interfingering was interpreted as a response to lake-level changes, the lake-level falls inducing increased sediment flux from the northern source, and lake-level highstands favoring the influx and progradation of sediments from the south.																			0016-7606					NOV	1997	109	11					1485	1501		10.1130/0016-7606(1997)109<1485:SSIITS>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606(1997)109<1485:SSIITS>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1997YF86600007

In this study, using the genome resolved metagenomics approach; we have deciphered the taxonomic diversity as well as the functional insights of the gene pools specific to this region. Initially, a total of 113 Metagenome Assembled Genomes (MAGs) were recovered from the two predominant seasons, that is, rainy (n = 50) and winter (n = 63). After bin refinement and de-replication, 27 MAGs (18 from Winter season and 9 from Rainy season) were reconstructed. These MAGs were either of high-quality (n = 10) or of medium quality (n = 17) that was determined based on genome completeness and contamination. These 27 MAGs spanning across 6 bacterial phyla and the most predominant ones were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Cyanobacteria regardless of the season. Functional annotation across the MAGs suggested the existence of all known types of arsenic resistance and metabolism genes. Besides, important secondary metabolites such as zoocin_A, prochlorosin, and microcin were also abundantly present in these genomes. The metagenomic study of this lake provides the first insights into the microbiome composition and functional classification of the gene pools in two predominant seasons. The presence of arsenic metabolism and resistance genes in the recovered genomes is a sign of adaptation of the microbes to the arsenic contamination in this region. The presence of secondary metabolite genes in the lake microbiome has several implications including the potential use of these for the pharmaceutical industry.

Ammonium uptake rates ranged from 0.01 to 3.69 mumol l-1 h-1 with three distinct seasonal maxima in the surface water. Nitrate uptake rates varied from <0.01 to 1.76 mumol l-1 h-1 and were independent of ambient NO3- concentrations. Relative preference indices for NH4+ and NO3- averaged 1.5 and 0.5, indicating that NH4+ was the principal N nutrient for phytoplankton utilization. Ammonium accounted for 79 % of the DIN utilized by phytoplankton in surface waters, while NO3- and N2 accounted for only 16 and 5 %. The turnover time for NH4+ averaged 5.8 h in surface water during the ice-free period, pointing to rapid regeneration of NH4+ within stratified waters. Nitrogen fixation rates varied from <0.01 to 1.29 mumol l-1 h-1, with a maximum during the spring bloom. Nitrogen fixation contributed 2.0 g N m-2 yr-1 to the lake, with the 3-week spring bloom accounting for approximately 60% of the annual N2 fixation. Seasonal variations in DIN uptake rates were correlated with changes in Chl-a concentration, water temperature and day length. No significant differences in lake N cycling dynamics were found when the present study was compared with work conducted in 1964.																			0003-9136					JAN	1993	126	3					273	288																WOS:A1993KN29800002
J	Fiore, M				Fiore, Massimiliano			The Neglected Campaign: The Italian Navy Contribution to the Siege of Leningrad	WAR IN HISTORY												German and Finnish forces encircled Leningrad in the fall of 1941, but were unable to complete the siege. A passage across Lake Ladoga, through which the Soviets sustained the defence of the city, remained open. To enforce the siege, the German Maritime Warfare Command ordered that light naval forces be transferred to Lake Ladoga. However, the Germans did not have those boats at their disposal and asked the Italians to provide them. Based on a critique of archival sources, this article analyses this largely neglected aspect of the Leningrad campaign and argues that, although the performance of the Regia Marina was excellent, its activity was not decisive in breaking Soviet resistance and forcing the fall of Leningrad. Even though circumstances prevented the Regia Marina from making the impact that its planners had wanted - a naval guerrilla force on Lake Ladoga could never have achieved a tight blockade of Leningrad - the campaign on Lake Ladoga offers an important and enlightening example of Axis wartime collaboration.

The Miage lake is a typical periglacial lake that is found on the right hydrographical side of the glacier. The glacier high dynamics produces frequent falls of huge ice blocks into the lake representing an important tourist draw. On August 9, 1996, after a long period of heavy rain, a big ice block, with estimated volume in the range 7,000-16,000 cubic meters, fell into the lake provoking an anomalous water wave that involved many tourists, causing some persons to be seriously wounded. The main goal of this work is to stress that for alpine glaciers a correct policy of natural hazard mitigation must be founded both on a good scientific understanding of the glacier dynamics and on rigorous measures of prevention, that in case of conflict must have anyhow priorities on touristic activities.

These multi-millennial long chronologies have mainly been built from tree remains found in lakes (subfossil wood from lake-shore trees). We used a unique dataset of Scots pine tree-ring data collected from wood remains found on a mountain slope in the central Scandinavian Mountains, yielding a chronology spanning over much of the last 1200 years. This data was compared with a local subfossil wood chronology with the aim to (1) describe growth variability in two environments during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and the early Little Ice Age (LIA), and (2) investigate differences in growth characteristics during these contrasting periods. It was shown that the local tree-line during both the MCA and early LIA was almost 150 m higher that at present. Based on living pines from the two environments, tree-line pine growth was strongly associated with mid-summer temperatures, while the lake-shore trees showed an additional response to summer precipitation. During the MCA, regarded to be a period of favorable climate in the region, the tree-ring data from both environments showed strong coherency and moderate growth variability. In the early LIA, the two chronologies were less coherent, with the tree-line chronology showing more variability, suggesting different growth responses in the two environments during this period of less favorable growing conditions. Our results indicate that tree-ring width chronologies mainly based on lake-shore trees may need to be re-evaluated.

The bacterial clones from three clone libraries were classified into 182 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), most of which were affiliated with bacterial divisions commonly found in freshwater ecosystems. Based on the identified classes, the bacterial communities on eelgrass and Hydrilla were distinct, such that Planctomycetes, Cyanobacteria, Bacilli and Actinobacteria were found on eelgrass and in the water column but not on Hydrilla. On the other hand, Deltaproteobacteria and Verrucomicrobiae were found on Hydrilla and in the water column but not on eelgrass. Further distinctions observed were that Armatimonadia and Deinococci were found only on Hydrilla while Gemmatimonadetes was found only on eelgrass. Our results indicated differences between the epiphytic bacterial community on the two plants and the water column at the species level, but an even representation of the most abundant phylogenetic taxa (classes) in all three libraries was revealed. Statistical comparison of the retrieved sequences confirmed that the three libraries did not differ significantly at the community level (LIBSHUFF, p<0.05).

These new records increased the number of counties where this parasite has been found by 42%, to a total of 51 counties in eight states. No permanent establishments of P. digoneutis have been found south of New York City, which suggests that high summer temperatures are limiting its spread southward. A good agreement was found between the parasite's southernmost establishment locations and a maximum summer temperature/duration of 30 degreesC (86 degreesF) for 14 to 30 days. This temperature limit suggests that P. digoneutis can disperse westward both north and south of Lake Erie, across southern Ontario and northern Ohio, to Michigan and Wisconsin.

Bacterial biomass production (BPP-C) was measured by the leucine method and bacterial cell multiplication (BCM) by the thymidine method. During the spring bloom a consistent diel pattern of BPP-C and BCM occurred with high rates from the evening until midnight. In July and August, no consistent diel pattern occurred although diel fluctuations were detectable. The diel variability of BPP-C, as well in single depths as in depth-integrated hourly values, was more pronounced than that of BCM. Integrated daily rates of both parameters, however, closely agreed. The ratio of BPP-C/BCM, the biomass per newly produced cell, indicated periods of unbalanced growth. The results suggest that grazing by vertically migrating crustacean zooplankton, mainly by daphnids, was the main controlling factor for the diel variability of bacterioplankton growth.																			0003-9136					MAY	1994	130	3					283	302																WOS:A1994NQ45700003

PACIFIC SILVER FIR NEEDLE DECOMPOSITION IN THE ASH-FALL ZONE	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE												The influence of air-fall tephra (ash) from the May 18 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens on decomposition of Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis (Dougl.) Forbes) needles was studied at two sites along the ash-fall plume northeast of the mountain, Elk Pass and Chambers Lake (20 and 60 km from the crater, respectively). Ash depths beneath the canopy of the old-growth stands at Elk Pass and Chambers Lake were 18 and 5 cm, respectively. Objectives of the study were to determine: (i) the decomposition rates of needles on the ash surface, buried under ash, and in control plots with ash removed; (ii) the effect of site on decomposition rates; and (iii) the influence of ash on forest floor temperature, moisture, and oxygen levels. Ash had considerable influence on litter decomposition. After 3 years, needles buried under ash had faster decomposition rates at both sites (k = 0.34 and 0.29/year at Elk Pass and Chambers Lake, respectively) than needles on the ash surface or in cleared control plots. There was a trend for needles on the ash surface to have slower decomposition (k = 0.18-0.23/year) than needles on control plots (k = 0.22-0.28/year). Site had little influence on buried needle decomposition; rates at Elk Pass and Chambers Lake were not significantly different, despite differences in ash texture and depth. Ash apparently did not reduce oxygen levels enough to reduce decomposition, but instead increased decomposition by influencing substrate moisture and temperature. Fastest decomposition occurred under the ash where conditions were moist and cool; slowest decomposition occurred on the ash surface where conditions were drier and warmer.

J	GREEN, RH				GREEN, RH			ROLE OF A UNIONID CLAM POPULATION IN THE CALCIUM BUDGET OF A SMALL ARCTIC LAKE	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Growth rate and morphometric parameters were estimated for the Anodonta grandis (Pelecypoda, Unionidae) population in Shell Lake, [Northwest Territories, Canada] (68.degree. N), based on sampling during the summer of 1972. Variation in density and size of Anodonta within the lake as a function of varying depth and slope of bottom was estimated by scuba during the summer of 1973. Predictive models based on the data estimate total Ca in shells of the Anodonta population to be 10.1 Mg, which is approximately half the amount of Ca dissolved in Shell Lake water. The youngest 4 or 5 yr-classes are missing from the estimated age distribution, and recent pollution may be a factor. Independent estimates of Ca used for shell growth, and of Ca released by death of individuals and subsequent shell dissolution, approximate 50% (of the Ca in the Anodonta population) per year. This implies a mean residence time in the Anodonta population of approximately 2 yr.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1980	37	2					219	224		10.1139/f80-028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f80-028													WOS:A1980JG86500010

The climate is semi-arid: precipitation is approximate to 700 mm year(-1), and evapotranspiration is approximate to 2500 mm year(-1). Some of the wetland water is currently used for irrigation. An interdisciplinary study was conducted on the geology, hydrology, pedology and biology of the wetland to determine its origin and history and to assess its longevity under present hydrological conditions. Sedimentary records from two piston cores (1.8 and 4 m long) indicate that the present wetland developed during the late Holocene on a low-relief alluvial plain. Floodplain deposits (sandy silts) are capped with wetland sediments (organic-rich clay and peat), which began to form at approximate to 700 BP. The swamp is dominated by Typha domingensis Pers. (approximate to 80%) and floating Cyperus papyrus L. (20%). It is fed by warm springs (T approximate to 35 degreesC; pH approximate to 6.4-6.9) emanating from grid faults of the rift floor. Water compositions suggest that sources are dominated by shallow meteoric water, with little contribution from deeper geothermal fluids. Siderite concretions in the floodplain silts reflect the Fe-reducing conditions that developed as the surface became submerged beneath the water table. The pollen record captured both local and more regional vegetation, showing the prevailing dry rift valley climate despite development of the wetter conditions on the valley floor. The diatom record also suggests a dramatic change in local hydrology. The combined biological records of this semi-arid wetland indicate an abrupt change to wetter conditions, most probably as a result of a regional change in climate. Rift tectonics provided accommodation space, maintained the wetland at or below the water table and enabled spring recharge. The size of the modern wetland has been reduced by about 60% since 1969, which suggests that the system may now be under hydrological stress due to anthropogenic impacts from land-use change.

Climate change impacts on human health at an actionable scale: a state-level assessment of Indiana, USA	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Climate change is already being felt on local levels, with historical records from the State of Indiana (USA) revealing warmer winters and more extreme precipitation events. To refine our understanding of climate change impacts on human health, we conducted a state-level assessment of future climate change impacts on human health using outputs from advanced climate model projections for this century. Future projections show a steep increase in extreme heat events, leading to greater potential vulnerability to heat disasters for Indiana communities. Additionally, a 2- to 4-fold increase in days with "uncomfortable night" conditions by the end of the century will strongly impact the cardiopulmonary health of more vulnerable populations (i.e., elderly, those with pre-existing conditions, children, and those with inadequate access to cooling). Continued trends for warmer winters and more flooding suggest a much greater risk for the expansion and virulence of a number of vector-borne diseases, such as Lyme disease, West Nile Virus, and "tropical" diseases for which the mosquito vectors will thrive. Higher temperatures will also drive more frequent and severe harmful algal blooms in lakes and reservoirs, with implications for human and animal health. Food systems will also be impacted, particularly with increased risk of contamination by bacteria and mycotoxins due to elevated heat and humidity.					; Filippelli, Gabriel/R-6009-2019; Freeman, Jennifer/L-3838-2019	Moreno-Madrinan, Max/0000-0001-7154-0707; Freeman, Jennifer/0000-0002-3669-9111; Wells, Ellen/0000-0002-7293-1395; 													0165-0009	1573-1480				DEC	2020	163	4			SI		1985	2004		10.1007/s10584-020-02710-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-020-02710-9		APR 2020											WOS:000528135800001
J	Sardella, BA; Brauner, CJ				Sardella, Brian A.; Brauner, Colin J.			Cold temperature-induced osmoregulatory failure: The physiological basis for tilapia winter mortality in the Salton Sea?	CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME												The Salton Sea is a large saline lake in southeastern California that has been plagued by large-scale mortality among the fishes that once comprised a robust recreational fishery. In addition to very high salinity (43-47g/I), other stressors such as large fluctuations in temperature exist that when combined with salinity can result in a severe physiological challenge to resident fishes. Fish kills during winter months are predominantly comprised of 'California' Mozambique tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus x O. urolepis hornorum, so we investigated the effects of temperature and salinity interaction as a cause of the mortality. Tilapia acclimated to 43 g/I were transferred from 25 degrees C to 15 or 35 degrees C in order to assess the effect on osmoregulatory ability. There were significant increases in plasma osmolality and [Na+] 24 h after tilapia were transferred to 15 degrees C that recovered to pre-transfer values by 120 h. In order to demonstrate the additive effects of temperature and salinity, we transferred tilapia from 35 g/I salinity at 25 degrees C to 43 g/I salinity at 15,25, and 35 degrees C. The combined temperature and salinity challenge significantly affected plasma osmolality and branchial Na+, K+-ATPase (NKA) activity, with fish in the 15 degrees C group experiencing mortality after 12 h. Branchial NKA activity was significantly increased 3 h following transfer, but was reduced by 6h in the 15 and 35 degrees C groups. The ability of this species to effectively osmoregulate as well as tolerate salinity transfer was impaired following a reduction in ambient temperature. Based on these experimental findings, we concluded that cold-induced tilapia mortality during winter months at the Salton Sea is due to osmoregulatory failure.																			0008-1078					FAL	2007	93	4					200	213																WOS:000251775300002

The assessment metrics for a hydrological drought were established according to the exposed wetlands associated with ecological impacts, and used to determine the characteristic water level for the occurrence and severity of drought. The causal effects of a hydrological drought were analyzed based on the hydrological regimes across lake areas, and the drought impact from the flow regulation in the TGD was evaluated by using a neural network model. The hydrological systems analysis indicates that: 1) the frequency, severity and causes of hydrological droughts varied for different lake areas and seasons due to the specific basin morphology and the deviation of water regimes; 2) the water storage in the Three Gorges Reservoir has advanced the exposed time of wetlands, and has prolonged the autumn drought by approximately 30 %. However, the modeling also reveals that the regular operation of the TGD did not change the natural drought trends at Dongting Lake, and it is not deemed as the primary cause of recent hydrological droughts.

J	NIHLGARD, B				NIHLGARD, B			RELATIONSHIP OF FOREST DAMAGE TO AIR-POLLUTION IN THE NORDIC COUNTRIES	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												In the Nordic countries, the bedrock is largely slowly weathered gneisis and granite with low amounts of nutrients. The soils are easily disturbed by acid rain; very low pH values and base saturation is found in the exposed areas of south Norway and southwest Sweden. Events with high levels of sulphur dioxide and/or other pollutants transported from Central Europe are common. Ozone continuously reaches concentration levels that damage vegetation during the summer. The total sulphur and nitrogen input to forests exceeds the tolerance limits of nature in the mentioned areas, and causes soil acidification and nutrient imbalance in the soil and in the forest trees. Low summer temperatures during recent years have affected large areas of the northern parts of the Nordic countries. The negative effects of air pollutants have been amplified by some dry years, affecting mainly the southern parts of the Nordic countries. In Sweden, 5000 out of 16 000 acidified lakes are limed today. Liming and mineral nutrient addition in the forests are also discussed as countermeasures.																			0168-1923	1873-2240				APR	1990	50	1-2					87	98		10.1016/0168-1923(90)90141-R	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0168-1923(90)90141-R													WOS:A1990CX92100007

Four diatom zones are recognized from a core taken at Fallen Leaf Lake (FLL), a site moderately impacted by human activities: (1) Pre-Little Ice Age Zone (840-1385), (2) Little Ice Age Zone (1385-1810) characterized by Stephanodiscus alpinus and Aulacoseira subarctica, (3) Transitional Zone (1810-1950) of warming and anthropogenic influence with increased Lindavia rossii-ocellata group and Discostella stelligera and decreased Pseudostaurosira brevistriata, and (4) Anthropogenic Zone (1950-2010) characterized by a rapid increase of mesotrophic diatoms of the Fragilaria tenera-nanana group, Tabellaria flocculosa strain IIIP, and Nitzschia gracilis. The Transitional Zone increases in elemental Co, Zn, and Sn that may be attributed to an increase in coal burning and smelting activities in California and Nevada. Beginning around 1910 and accelerating in the 1940s, increased building, land-use, and recreation around FLL caused an increase in terrestrial sedimentary input. Down core proxies for atmospheric N deposition in the FLL watershed are, at best, weakly expressed and appear to be overshadowed by stronger signals. Lack of support for N deposition includes the asynchrony in the appearance of the N-sensitive diatom Asterionella formosa in FLL and a lower impact site at Gilmore Lake, and an uninformative delta N-15 record. Asterionella formosa is a dominant component in the FLL water column today, but has been present in similar abundances for at least the last 1200 years. Asterionella formosa is present in the water column at Gilmore Lake and absent from the sediment, indicating a very recent appearance. The data collected show that the FLL record is sensitive to climatic cooling during the Little Ice Age and to anthropogenic activities commencing in the 1800s that increased throughout the latter half of the twentieth century; however the effects of anthropogenic N deposition in these lakes could not be substantiated.

MIF is a powerful tool in understanding the Hg transformations and reaction mechanisms. Here we look into the MIF of the two odd isotopes of mercury (Hg-199 and Hg-201) in sediment samples collected from lakes and springs of Florida, Lake Erie, and Yucatan Peninsula. The Delta Hg-199 and Delta Hg-201 of the sediments range from +0.52 parts per thousand to -0.48 parts per thousand. From the isotopic signature we interpret the possible source of Hg in the Yucatan Peninsula carbonate to be Hg(II) from the water column. Hg in the Florida lakes and spring sediments primarily comes from litterfall. Lake Erie appears to have an anthropogenic source. This study suggests that the MIF signature of Hg isotopes can be used to qualitatively determine the primary source(s) of Hg in sediments. (C) 2015 The Authors.

They are based on data from pollen analyses of lakes and peat-bogs, plant macrofossils, archaeobotanical finds and radiocarbon dating. During the early Holocene, after 7900 cal. b.p. (5950 cal. b.c.) the climate changed to cooler summers, milder winters and higher precipitation resulting in the formation of a coniferous belt dominated by Pinus sp. and Abies alba. These favorable environmental pre-conditions had a positive influence on the Neolithisation of the Balkans after the 8200 cal. b.p. (6250 cal. b.c.) cold event, which caused drought in the Eastern Mediterranean. Direct evidence from wood charcoal records from the Neolithic settlement layers in the study area shows a slight modification of the surrounding woodlands and an increase of the light-demanding components, probably expressed through larger forest border zones and thinning out of the wood stands. The increase in the number of settlements in the valleys of southwestern Bulgaria intensified the human activity visible in the palaeobotanical record from 6950 cal. b.p. (5000 cal. b.c.) onwards. Between ca. 5700-5100 cal. b.p. (3800-3200 cal. b.c.) signs of anthropogenic influence on the vegetation are virtually absent. The intensity of human impact increased notably after 3200 cal. b.p. (1400-1250 cal. b.c., approx. Late Bronze Age), documented by a rise of pollen anthropogenic indicators. The final transformations in the natural forest cover after 2750 cal. b.p. (800 cal. b.c. onset of the Iron Age) marked the reduction of the coniferous forests dominated by Abies alba and Pinus sp. and the expansion of Fagus sylvatica and Picea abies. These vegetation changes are contemporaneous with increase of the palaeofire activities and the next peak of anthropogenic indicators. The changes in the landscape during the Roman period and the medieval period reflect regional environmental features and were forced by the diversification of anthropogenic activity.

J	Steckenreuter, A; Möller, L; Harcourt, R				Steckenreuter, Andre; Moeller, Luciana; Harcourt, Robert			How does Australia's largest dolphin-watching industry affect the behaviour of a small and resident population of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins?	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The small, genetically distinct population of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in Port Stephens, New South Wales (NSW), is the target of the largest dolphin-watching industry in Australia and is located within the Port Stephens Great Lakes Marine Park that was created in 2005. The effects of this industry have been identified as of significant management importance by the Marine Parks Authority NSW. Accordingly, the impact of commercial dolphin-watching boats was investigated from boat-based surveys from August 2008 to August 2009. Presence of dolphin-watching boats altered both the dolphins' behavioural states and activity budgets. Dolphins spent 66.5% less time feeding and 44.2% less time socialising, spent four times more milling, and were never observed to rest in the presence of dolphin-watching boats. Moreover, dolphin groups were more cohesive during dolphin-watching boat encounters and dolphins tended to avoid tour boats. These effects were exacerbated as the number of boats increased and the distance from boats decreased. The rate of approach was high with boats approaching each dolphin group three times per day in winter and six times in summer. Moreover, groups of dolphins with newborns were approached closer than state regulated minimum approach distances in nine out of ten encounters. Globally, dolphin-watching industries frequent small resident groups of coastal dolphins and effects are likely to be similar. We suggest that existing controls are inadequate and that these together with additional regulations be enforced by a regular presence of authorities. We suggest no more than one dolphin-watching boat within 50 m of a group of dolphins, or 100 m if calves are present. Operating times of dolphin-watching boats should be restricted in numbers after 1 pm, i.e., during preferred foraging times for dolphins. Additionally, exclusion zones should be considered to reduce pressure on dolphins undertaking critical activities such as feeding and resting. We recommend monitoring the effectiveness of new regulations that are incorporated in the reviewed marine park management plan in 2012 for a period of three years. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this scope, the questionnaire survey conducted by Turkish Statistical Institute in 2004 to investigate annual amount of water abstracted to drinking water networks by type of resources in 81 provinces was evaluated. In the questionnaire, sources were grouped under five categories as spring, (artificial) lake, river, reservoir and well. Due to the complex and multivariate characteristics of the data sets, to replace a large collection of variables with a smaller number of factors the statistical method "factor analysis" was performed. Results revealed that, water supply systems in the country were mainly governed by groundwater sources (well and/or spring). However, in the northeastern part of the country, rivers were allocated for drinking water supply. On the other hand, reservoir dependent cities were densely located in Marmara, Central Anatolia and Southeast Anatolia Regions.

J	Carrington, ME; Mullahey, JJ				Carrington, Mary E.; Mullahey, J. Jeffrey			Effects of burning season and frequency on saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) flowering and fruiting	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Medicinal use of saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) fruits in treating benign prostatic hypertrophy has driven a recent sharp increase in fruit harvesting. At the same time, saw palmetto often is considered a keystone species, serving as habitat or a food source for several hundred mammal, bird, reptile, amphibian and insect species. Due to harvesting pressure on this ecologically important, non-cultivated species, land management practices that produce environmentally sustainable harvests are needed. As part of research focusing on use of controlled burning as a management tool, we investigated effects of burning season and frequency on saw palmetto flowering and fruiting in 32 pine flatwoods sites in central and southwest Florida from 1997 to 1999. The study was conducted as two repeated measures experiments, each involving 16 sites. Each experiment included two among-subjects factors - burning season and past burning frequency - and one within-subjects factor -year- with four replications of each treatment combination. For both experiments, growing season (i.e., April-July) burns had high flowering levels the first year after burning (mean proportion of saw palmettos flowering = 0.49, n = 16 sites), but decreased the second year after burning (mean proportion flowering = 0.15, n = 16 sites), while winter (i.e., November-February) burns had intermediate levels of flowering during both the first and second years after burning (mean proportions flowering = 0.21 and 0.28 for first and second years after burning, n = 16 sites). Although most flowering occurred during April and May, flowering occurred 2-5 months after winter burns, but did not occur until 9-12 months after growing season burns. During the 1997-1998 experiment, fruit infection by the fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporioides caused a fruiting failure in all sites. During the 1998-1999 experiment, fruit yields were higher in growing season burns only in infrequently burned (i.e., burned less often than every 5 years) sites, and only in 1998 (mean fruit yields = 325 kg/ha and 0.25 kg/ha for growing season, infrequently burned sites and winter, infrequently burned sites; n = 4 sites in each group). Frequently burned (i.e., burned every 2-3 years) sites generally had low fruit yields (mean fruit yields = 163 kg/ha and 242 kg/ha for frequently burned sites in 1998 and 1999; n = 8 sites).

Recent mapping of the resident trout populations detected the presence of brown troutSalmo trutta(sensu stricto) of the Atlantic (AT) mtDNA lineage introduced into populations of both tentative Danubian troutSalmo labraxand of tentative Adriatic troutSalmo farioidesbelonging to the Danubian (DA) and Adriatic (AD) mtDNA lineages, respectively. Introduction of the tentative Macedonian troutSalmo macedonicusof the AD lineage was also detected in a native population of the tentativeS. labrax. In almost all recipient nonmigratory trout populations, a cross-breeding between native and introduced trout was detected by heterozygosity in either only theLDH-Cnuclear locus or theLDH-Cand specific microsatellite loci. The only exception was a population where both resident and migratory, lake-dwelling individuals of the tentative Adriatic trout spawned in a downstream section of a stream in Montenegro, as no microsatellite alleles of Atlantic brown trout that had been introduced upstream were detected. The occurrence of cross-breeding between Adriatic and brown trout was evident in the isolated, upstream section. It appears that migrating, lake-dwelling Adriatic trout in combination with their resident, stream-dwelling conspecifics suppress the introgression of genes from those situated upstream. In this regard, consideration should be given to the occurrence of the migratory brown trout in the Danube River at the broader Iron Gate Gorge area. They migrate in late summer and early fall from the Iron Gate One reservoir to the lower sections of tributaries devoid of any trout fish. However, some of these streams house very special native trout of the DA lineage in their short-extending upper sections. These native trout populations are, so far, still out of contact with the reservoir-dwelling trout. However, given the resilience of trout and their migratory life history, the outcome of this introduction could be deleterious for those native fish that are very precious in the conservation sense.

There is a magma chamber beneath Cheonji, and variations in the magma chamber cause volcanic antecedents such as changes in the temperature and water pressure of hot spring water. Consequently, there is an abnormal region in Cheonji where ice melts quicker than in other areas, freezes late even during the freezing period, and has a hightemperature water surface. The abnormal area is a discharge region for hot spring water, and its ice gradient may be used to monitor volcanic activity. However, due to geographical, political and spatial issues, periodic observation of abnormal regions of Cheonji is limited. In this study, the degree of ice change in the optimal region was quantified using a Landsat -5/-7/-8 optical satellite image and a Modified U-Net regression model. From January 22, 1985 to December 8, 2020, the Visible and Near Infrared (VNIR) band of 83 Landsat images including anomalous regions was utilized. Using the relative spectral reflectance of water and ice in the VNIR band, unique data were generated for quantitative ice variability monitoring. To preserve as much information as possible from the visible and near-infrared bands, ice gradient was noticed by applying it to U-Net with two encoders, achieving good prediction accuracy with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 140 and a correlation value of 0.9968. Since the ice change value can be seen with high precision from Landsat images using Modified U-Net in the future may be utilized as one of the methods to monitor Baekdu Mountain's volcanic activity, and a more specific volcano monitoring system can be built.																			1225-6161	2287-9307				DEC	2022	-38	6	2				1691	1707		10.7780/kjrs.2022.38.6.2.10	http://dx.doi.org/10.7780/kjrs.2022.38.6.2.10													WOS:001227382200001

Extremely 'vanadiphilic' multiply metal-resistant and halophilic aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs, strains EG13 and EG8, from hypersaline springs in Canada	EXTREMOPHILES												Two pinkish peach-colored strains of obligately aerobic phototrophic bacteria, EG13 and EG8, were isolated from a saline spring effluent stream in west central Manitoba, Canada. The strains possessed bacteriochlorophyll a incorporated into a typical purple bacterial light-harvesting complex 1 (870 nm) and reaction center (801 nm). Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated 100 % identity among the isolates and 99 % similarity to Roseovarius tolerans EL-172(T). The strains were physiologically well adapted to high salinity (0-22 %), fluctuating pH (7-12) and temperature (7-40 A degrees C) of the exposed hypersaline stream of East German Creek. EG8 and EG13 were also highly resistant to the toxic metal(loid) oxyanions tellurite, selenite and metavanadate (a parts per thousand yen1000 mu g/ml each). Most intriguingly, growth and pigment production of EG13 on glutamate minimal medium was stimulated by 1000-10000 mu g/ml of sodium metavanadate compared to metal-free conditions. Phylogenetic analysis and phenotypic properties such as pigment composition and morphology indicate close relatedness to Roseovarius genus.

Interglacial history of a palaeo-lake and regional environment: A multi-proxy study of a permafrost deposit from Bol'shoy Lyakhovsky Island, Arctic Siberia	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Chironomid, pollen, and rhizopod records from a permafrost sequence at Bol'shoy Lyakhovsky Island (New Siberian Archipelago) document the development of a thermokarst palaeo-lake and environmental conditions in the region during the last Interglacial (MIS 5e). Open Poaceae and Artemisia associations dominated vegetation at the beginning of the interglacial period. Rare shrub thickets (Salix, Betula nana, Alnus fruticosa) grew in more protected and wetter places as well. Saalian ice wedges started to melt during this time, resulting in the formation of an initial thermokarst water body. The high percentage of semi-aquatic chironomids suggests that a peatland-pool initially existed at the site. A distinct decrease in semi-aquatic chironomid taxa and an increase in lacustrine ones point to a gradual pooling of water in the basin, which could in turn induce thermokarst and create a permanent pond during the subsequent period. The highest relative abundance of Chironomus and Procladius reflects unfrozen water remaining under the ice throughout the ice-covered period during the later stage of palaeo-lake development. The chironomid record points to three successive stages during the history of the lake: (1) a peatland pool; (2) a pond (i.e., shallower than the maximum ice-cover thickness); and (3) a shallow lake (i.e., deeper than the maximum ice-cover thickness). The trend of palaeo-lake development indicates that intensive thermokarst processes occurred in the region during the last Interglacial. Shrub tundra communities with Alnus fruticosa and Betula nana dominated the vegetation during the interglacial optimum. The climate was moister and warmer than present. The results of this study suggest that quantitative chironomid-based temperature reconstructions from Arctic thermokarst ponds/lakes may be problematic due to other key environmental factors, such as prolonged periods of winter anoxia and local hydrological/geomorphological processes, controlling the chironomid assemblages.

The most abundant species was Peridinium cinctum f. westii (Lemm) Lef. (Pyrrophyta) which blooms during March-April, sometimes forming over 95% of the phytoplankton biomass. Peridinium was found in the guts throughout the year, even in autumn, when this algal species is not generally found in phytoplankton samples, indicating selective feeding in T. galilaea. Being a consumer of phytoplankton and part of the second link in the trophic chain in the lake, the growth of this fish ensures the least possible loss of energy. The efficiency of this fish in Lake Kinneret is emphasized.																			0044-8486	1873-5622					1976	9	1					47	59		10.1016/0044-8486(76)90047-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0044-8486(76)90047-8													WOS:A1976CH25500004

Lesser scaup collected on the IHC had higher concentrations of cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), selenium (Se), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), selected organchlorine pesticides, polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, polychlorinated dibenzofurans, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and aliphatic hydrocarbons than reference birds. Of the scaup collected on the IHC, 44% had Cd concentrations in the liver considered above background for freshwater waterfowl (> 3 mu g/g dry wt.), 50% had Se concentrations in the liver above a level possibly harmful to the health of young and adult birds (> 33 mu g/g dry wt.), and 88% of the scaup carcasses exceeded the PCB human consumption guidelines for edible poultry in the USA (> 3.0 mu g/g lipid wt.). The ratio of pristane:n-heptadecane concentrations in 47% of lesser scaup collected on IHC was elevated above 1.0, which is indicative of chronic exposure to petroleum hydrocarbons.

However, in recent years, the irrational land use situation of occupied wetlands has occurred frequently, resulting in the destruction of the breeding of the Hooded Crane population and the destruction of the wintering habitat. The paper takes Xinqing Wetland and Shengjin Lake Wetland as the research area, and uses landscape ecology and geostatistics as the theoretical basis to reveal the changes of land landscape in the study area, and analyze the main breeding and wintering habitat types of Hooded Crane. The landscape ecological risk assessment model is constructed by the landscape pattern index method, and the ecological risk in the study area is divided into five levels: extremely low ecological risk, low ecological risk, medium ecological risk, high ecological risk and extremely high ecological risk. The landscape ecological risk of the study area is analyzed from the aspects of single landscape type, spatial distribution characteristics and time series changes. Overall, from 1986 to 2018, the landscape ecological risks of Xinqing Wetland and Shengjin Lake Wetland all showed an upward trend, both from the low ecological risk level in 1986 to the middle ecological risk level in 2018. The ecological risk value of Xinqing Wetland increased from 0.3777 in 1986 to 0.5882 in 2018; the ecological risk value of Shengjin Lake wetland landscape increased from 0.2706 in 1986 to 0.5709 in 2018. The growth rate of the Shengjin Lake wetland is higher than that of the Xinqing Wetland. In order to better protect the ecological environment of the wetland and protect the habitat of the Hooded Crane, this paper will propose corresponding suggestions and countermeasures.

Culture Independent Genomic Comparisons Reveal Environmental Adaptations for Altiarchaeales	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												The recently proposed candidatus order Altiarchaeales remains an uncultured archaeal lineage composed of genetically diverse, globally widespread organisms frequently observed in anoxic subsurface environments. In spite of 15 years of studies on the psychrophilic biofilm-producing Candidatus Altiarchaeum hamiconexum and its close relatives, very little is known about the phylogenetic and functional diversity of the widespread free-living marine members of this taxon. From methanogenic sediments in the White Oak River Estuary, NC, USA, we sequenced a single cell amplified genome (SAG). WOR_SM1_SCG, and used it to identify and refine two high-quality genomes from metagenomes, WOR_SM1_79 and WOR_SM1_86-2, from the same site. These three genomic reconstructions form a monophyletic group, which also includes three previously published genomes from metagenomes from terrestrial springs and a SAG from Sakinaw Lake in a group previously designated as pMC2A384. A synapomorphic mutation in the Altiarchaeales tRNA synthetase 8 subunit, pheT, caused the protein to be encoded as two subunits at non-adjacent loci. Consistent with the terrestrial spring clades, our estuarine genomes contained a near-complete autotrophic metabolism, H-2 or CO as potential electron donors, a reductive acetyl-CoA pathway for carbon fixation, and methylotroph-like NADP(H)-dependent dehydrogenase. Phylogenies based on 16S rRNA genes and concatenated conserved proteins identified two distinct subclades of Altiarchaeales, Alti-1 populated by organisms from actively flowing springs, and Alti-2 which was more widespread, diverse, and not associated with visible mats. The core Alti-1 genome suggested Alti-1 is adapted for the stream environment with lipopolysaccharide production capacity and extracellular hami structures. The core Alti-2 genome suggested members of this clade are free-living with distinct mechanisms for energy maintenance, motility, osmoregulation, and sulfur redox reactions. These data suggested that the hamus structures found in Candidatus Altiarchaeum hamiconexum are not present outside of stream-adapted Altiarchaeales. Homologs to a Na+ transporter and membrane bound coenzyme A disulfide reductase that were unique to the brackish sediment Alti-2 genomes, could indicate adaptations to the estuarine, sulfur-rich environment.

Spatial variation of nitrogen fixation in lakes of the northern Great Plains	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Cyanobacterial blooms are a regular feature of lakes in central North America, but little is known of their importance to the nitrogen (N) cycle and nutrition of aquatic food webs. We hypothesized that N-2-fixing cyanobacteria constitute a significant source of N to prairie lakes, that fixed N is effectively transferred to primary and secondary consumers, and that the importance of fixed N is structured on a landscape scale due to spatial gradients of lake chemistry and catchment characteristics. These hypotheses were tested using stable isotope analyses and mass budgets in six chained lakes of the northern Great Plains that were sampled biweekly during summers of 1994-2004. Mean annual N isotope signatures of particulate organic matter (delta N-15-POM) were highly correlated to the abundance of N-2-tixing cyanobacteria (r(2) = 0.75, p < 0.001), but exhibited no marked spatial organization. Instead, the temporal variability of delta N-15-POM was greatest in downstream lakes where N-2-fixing cyanobacteria were abundant. Furthermore, Seasonal declines in delta N-15-POM were correlated with reductions in delta N-15 of individual zooplankton taxa (Daphnia spp., Diacyclops thomasi, Leptodiaptomus siciloides, Leptodora kindtii), especially in downstream eastern lakes. N mass balances revealed that the importance of biological N-2 fixation relative to total N inputs (up to 77%) and initial N standing stock (up to 201 %) were significantly linearly correlated with landscape position (0.59 <= r(2) <= 0.83, p <= 0.07) and effective drainage area (0.61 <= r(2) <= 0.98, p <= 0.07), as were volumetric and areal estimates of N-2 fixation during summer (r(2) <= 0.87, p <= 0.007). These patterns demonstrate that fixed N is spatially structured, highly predictable based on landscape position, and readily assimilated into aquatic food webs.

Effect of Beaver on Brook Trout Habitat in North Shore, Lake Superior, Streams	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis is a native salmonid that provides a valued and productive sport fishery in northeastern Minnesota. Revival of North American beaver Castor canadensis (hereafter, "beaver") populations since their near extermination and concern over their impacts on Brook Trout habitat prompted a reexamination of the complex ecological relationship where the two taxa interact. Suitable Brook Trout habitat is characterized by cold, spring-fed water with silt-free rocky substrate and abundant cover, all of which beaver may directly or indirectly affect. Data collection occurred on 79 stream sections (200 m each) and 21 beaver ponds spanning the North Shore of Lake Superior during the summer in 2017 and 2018. Habitat suitability index (HSI) models determined the average HSI and quantity of suitable Brook Trout habitat (m(2)/100 m(2)) at stream and beaver pond sites, and a bioenergetics model calculated Brook Trout growth availability (m(2)/100 m(2)) and mean growth (g/d) at stream sites. Classification regression trees identified significant thresholds at which beaver activity (e.g., number of dams upstream of sampled sites and beaver pond age) influenced the quantity or quality of Brook Trout habitat and growth. No significant variables were identified as affecting Brook Trout habitat or growth rates in stream sites. Alternatively, the quantity and quality of Brook Trout habitat in this region appeared to be influenced by microhabitat variables (depth, velocity, and temperature) that are eminent at individual stream sites. Brook Trout growth was strongly influenced by velocity (m/s) and mean prey concentration (mg dry mass/m(3)). Results indicated that 12 of the 21 sampled beaver ponds contained suitable Brook Trout habitat, with dissolved oxygen (mg/L) identified as a threshold. This study recommends focusing on individual stream characteristics and beaver pond dissolved oxygen concentrations to achieve desired Brook Trout habitat and aid in the development of management strategies pertaining to these two taxa in Lake Superior's North Shore streams.

In Sweden's largest lakes, Vanern and Vattern, the breakup of ice has occurred considerably earlier since 1979 and ice-free winters have become more frequent. Comparison between the years when the lakes were ice covered with those when they remained ice-free in terms of 37 lake variables revealed significant differences in water temperatures, sulphate concentrations and the biomass of diatoms in May after ice breakup (P < 0.01). In particular, the biomass of the genus Aulacoseira increased significantly, which may explain increasing complaints about algae that clog fishing-nets, filter-beds and micro-strainers in waterworks in Vanern and Vattern. We assume that Aulacoseira is mainly affected by changes in climate-driven water circulation patterns. In contrast, other observed water quality changes such as changes in sulphate concentration might rather be attributed to changes in atmospheric deposition. To explain water quality changes in Sweden's largest lakes it is important to consider changes in both climate and atmospheric deposition as well as catchment measures.

S.; Popov, S., V; Pryakhina, G., V			Hydrological characteristics of lakes in the eastern part of the Broknes Peninsula, Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												Broknes Peninsula (the area of the Progress station, Larsemann Hills, Princess Elisabeth Land, East Antarctica) is characterized by the presence of well developed hydrographic network consisting of reservoirs located not only in the bedrock, but also inside the glacier thickness and on its surface. As a rule, most of them are dammed by natural snow-ice weirs, which are often destroyed during the Antarctic summer. As a result of this process, glacial water outburst may occur. In the course of the summer season of the 63-th Russian Antarctic Expedition (RAE) intensive hydrological field observations were carried out for identification and comprehensive investigation of potentially outburst prone reservoirs located in close proximity to Russian and foreign stations and field bases (area of the Progress station and the field base Law-Racovita). The works included: the organization of temporary pile and depth-stick water gauge stations, mapping positions of the shoreline of lakes (reservoirs), bathymetric surveys of them, as well as field hydro-chemical express analyses. Based on the results of the level measurement, it was found that most of the lakes of the oasis are characterized by a sharp drop in the height of the water surface level associated with the breakthroughs. In particular, the authors witnessed the breakthrough of the Discussion Lake, which occurred on January 22, 2018. This resulted in decrease of the water level by 0.95 m. Based on the data of the bathymetric surveys, the morphometric (hydrometric) characteristics of the lakes were calculated and detailed grids (regular net of rectangular matrices, in the nodes of which some effective values of the mapped values are located) were formed for the following numerical modeling of hypothetical and real breakthroughs of water bodies and construction of estimated hydrographs.					; Popov, Sergey/IYJ-2371-2023; Boronina, Alina/U-1830-2018	Prahina, Galina/0000-0003-3684-4638; Popov, Sergey/0000-0002-1830-8658; Boronina, Alina/0000-0002-3486-5243													2076-6734	2412-3765					2019	59	1					39	48		10.15356/2076-6734-2019-1-39-48	http://dx.doi.org/10.15356/2076-6734-2019-1-39-48													WOS:000461805000003
J	Brady, VJ; Cardinale, BJ; Burton, TM				Brady, VJ; Cardinale, BJ; Burton, TM			Zebra mussels in a coastal marsh: The seasonal and spatial limits of colonization	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We investigated the seasonal cycles and spatial distribution of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in a coastal marsh in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, from 1993 to 1995. This marsh was characterized by a sandy substrate and ice scour which removes emergent vegetation each winter Due to this lack of permanent substrates, we expected that populations in the marsh would only be maintained during the ice free season, with recruitment from open waters responsible for recolonization each year. Instead, we found that substrate independent clusters over-wintered in the zone of emergent vegetation and were the source of recruitment to the marsh. Peak larval production occurred during July of both years with greatest densities between 300 and 350 m from shore. Settlement of these larvae onto Scirpus stems occurred by late August, accounting for the greatest numbers of mussels attached to stems. Mussel abundance was highest between 300 and 450 m from shore, but was very low inshore of 300 m. Losses of attached mussels from Scirpus stems reduced abundances by as much as 80% by the end of September 1994 despite the fact that the stems were still intact and healthy. The greatest losses occurred between 300 and 400 m from shore, while mussel abundance was increasing at the bayward edge of the emergent vegetation. The high abundance of larvae and attached juveniles near the center of the marsh, as well as the high loss of attached mussels in this area, may be related to a recently described form of horizontal stratification in coastal wetlands.					; Cardinale, Bradley/I-7076-2013	Cardinale, Bradley/0000-0002-5591-6206; Brady, Valerie/0000-0002-2575-1017; 													0380-1330						1995	21	4					587	593		10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71069-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71069-3													WOS:A1995TP51700016

Pers on the total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in the eutrophic lake landscape in winter, and compared that to the aquatic plant-Eichhornia crassipes Mart as well as the control water sample, in which only floating plates are added. The result of the study shows that after water cultivation, Trifolium repots and Erigeron annuus (L.) have some removing effect toward the TN and TP in the eutrophic water body landscape, and respectively, the removal percentages in TN are 21%,22% and the percentages in TP are 82%,21%. The test to paired samples shows that the purification effect of these two xerophyte towards TN and TP is obviously better than that of the control water sample (TN:15.6%, TP:-6%) and the difference was significant(P<0.05). Compared the purification effect of these two terrestrial plants with that of Eichhornia crassipes (TN 20%, TP 53%), the difference on purification effect to TN was not obvious while that to TIP is significant. Between these two terrestrial plants, Trifolium repens has far better purification effect than Eichhornia crassipes,and the difference was particularly significant. Erigeron annuus (L.), however, had less purification effect than Eichhornia crassipes. and the difference was also significant. The results of this study provide new plant resources to ecological restoration of the eutrophic water bodies in winter, especially those polluted by phosphorus.					yu, jiang/IQT-1529-2023																978-1-935068-16-7				2010							1043	+																WOS:000289700000234

Isopods from Pauline Cove, Yukon Territory, showed quantitiative differences in total lipid and carbohydrate compared with those of simialar body size from Dolomite Lake, Northwest Territories. Total chitin, ash, and protein were similar in isopods from both sites. A seasonal accumulation of protein and lipid was observed in isopods from Dolomite Lake prior to the onset of winter. The roles of ecological habitat, season, parasitism, nutritional and reproductive cycles in the organic composition of M. entomon are discussed.																			0722-4060	1432-2056				JUN	1989	9	6					391	395		10.1007/BF00442530	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00442530													WOS:A1989AA69500007
J	Whan, K; Zwiers, F				Whan, Kirien; Zwiers, Francis			The impact of ENSO and the NAO on extreme winter precipitation in North America in observations and regional climate models	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												The relationship between winter precipitation in North America and indices of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is evaluated using non-stationary generalized extreme value distributions with the indices as covariates. Both covariates have a statistically significant influence on precipitation that is well simulated by two regional climate models (RCMs), CanRCM4 and CRCM5. The observed influence of the NAO on extreme precipitation is largest in eastern North America, with the likelihood of a negative phase extreme rainfall event decreased in the north and increased in the south under the positive phase of the NAO. This pattern is generally well simulated by the RCMs although there are some differences in the extent of influence, particularly south of the Great Lakes. A La Nia-magnitude extreme event is more likely to occur under El Nio conditions in California and the southern United States, and less likely in most of Canada and a region south of the Great Lakes. This broad pattern is also simulated well by the RCMs but they do not capture the increased likelihood in California. In some places the extreme precipitation response in the RCMs to external forcing from a covariate is of the opposite sign, despite use of the same lateral boundary conditions and dynamical core. This demonstrates the importance of model physics for teleconnections to extreme precipitation.					; Zwiers, Francis/AFN-4089-2022	Whan, Kirien/0000-0002-1935-7267; 													0930-7575	1432-0894				MAR	2017	48	5-6					1401	1411		10.1007/s00382-016-3148-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-016-3148-x													WOS:000395060900001

The driving forces for the change are still not entirely clear. This study examined the area change of the lakes greater than 1 km(2) in the endorheic basins of the Tibetan Plateau (EBTP) using Landsat images from 1990 to 2019, and analysed the relationships between lake area and local and large-scale climate variables at different geographic scales. The results show that lake area in the EBTP has increased significantly from 1990 to 2019 at a rate of 432.52 km(2)center dot year(-1). In the past 30 years, lake area changes in the EBTP have mainly been affected by local climate variables such as precipitation and temperature. At a large scale, Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) has correlations with lake area in western sub-regions in the Inner Basin (IB). While Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) has a significant connection with lake area, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) does not. We also found that abnormal drought (rainfall) brought by the El Nino/La Nina events are significantly correlated with the lake area change in most sub-regions in the IB.					; Wang, Liuming/IQR-7889-2023; She, Jiangfeng/AAK-9038-2020; Zhu, Liping/AAC-4284-2022; LI, MENGYAO/AAY-8923-2021; 李, 海星/ABE-6456-2021	She, Jiangfeng/0000-0001-8536-8645; Zhu, Liping/0000-0002-4234-8748; Wang, Junxiao/0000-0001-8450-7658; Wang, Liuming/0000-0001-9158-765X														2072-4292				DEC	2021	13	24							5125	10.3390/rs13245125	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13245125													WOS:000737505900001
J	Beutel, MW; Horne, AJ; Roth, JC; Barratt, NJ				Beutel, MW; Horne, AJ; Roth, JC; Barratt, NJ			Limnological effects of anthropogenic desiccation of a large, saline lake, Walker Lake, Nevada	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Walker Lake is a monomictic, nitrogen-limited, terminal lake located in western Nevada. It is one of only eight large (Area>100 km(2), Z (mean)>15 m) saline lakes of moderate salinity (3-20 g l(-1)) worldwide, and one of the few to support an endemic trout fishery (Oncorhynchus clarki henshawi). As a result of anthropogenic desiccation, between 1882 and 1996 the lake's volume has dropped from 11.1 to 2.7 km(3) and salinity has increased from 2.6 to 12-13 g l(-1). This study, conducted between 1992 and 1998, examined the effects of desiccation on the limnology of the lake. Increases in salinity over the past two decades caused the extinction of two zooplankton species, Ceriodaphnia quadrangula and Acanthocyclops vernalis. Recent increases in salinity have not negatively affected the lake's dominant phytoplankton species, the filamentous blue-green algae Nodularia spumigena. In 1994 high salinity levels (14-15 g l(-1)) caused a decrease in tui chub minnow populations, the main source of food for Lahontan cutthroat trout, and a subsequent decrease in the health of stocked trout. Lake shrinkage has resulted in hypolimnetic anoxia and hypolimnetic accumulation of ammonia (800-2000 mug-N l(-1)) and sulfide (15 mg l(-1)) to levels toxic to trout. Internal loading of ammonia via hypolimnetic entrainment during summer wind mixing (170 Mg-N during a single event), vertical diffusion (225-500 Mg-N year(-1)), and fall destratification (540-740 Mg-N year(-1)) exceeds external nitrogen loading (<25 Mg-N year(-1)). Increasing salinity in combination with factors related to hypolimnetic anoxia have stressed trout populations and caused a decline in trout size and longevity. If desiccation continues unabated, the lake will be too saline (>15-16 g l(-1)) to support trout and chub fisheries in 20 years, and in 50-60 years the lake will reach hydrologic equilibrium at a volume of 1.0 km(3) and a salinity of 34 g l(-1).																			0018-8158					DEC	2001	466	1-3					91	105		10.1023/A:1014569521381	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1014569521381													WOS:000174354200009
J	Räsänen, ME; Auri, J; Ovaskainen, J				Rasanen, Matti E.; Auri, Jaakko; Ovaskainen, Juha			Revised Middle and Late Pleistocene interglacial and interstadial records from the glaciated eastern Fennoscandia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Middle to Late Pleistocene palaeoenvironmental record from the repeatedly glaciated central and eastern Fennoscandia is poorly known. The majority of the glacial and warm interval records have been interpreted to represent only the last, Weichselian, glacial cycle (119-11.7 ka). We have revised the crucial part of the existing stratigraphic documentation in central and southern Finland. Our findings show that a considerable part of the depositional record extends further back in time and is more complete than previously thought. One record may reach the Middle Pleistocene Holsteinian Interglacial (approximate to MIS 11), 424-374 ka ago, and a large number of records are tentatively attributed to the Middle Pleistocene Ropersdorf-Schoningen Interglacial (approximate to MIS 7) 243-191 ka ago. During this possible Ropersdorf-Schoningen Interglacial, the Gulf of Bothnia hosted larger alkaline and smaller dystrophic lakes surrounded by boreal pine forests in a continental climate with warmer summers and colder winters than today. The Eemian (approximate to MIS 5e) 131-119 ka sea coastal records show detailed evidence of the widespread intermixing of continental fresh and marine waters. During the Early Weichselian Brorup Interstadial (approximate to MIS 5c) 109-96 ka, central and southern Finland seem to have supported open birch forest tundra, later invaded by spruce; not boreal pine forest as earlier thought. The early birch vegetation faced a tundra phase which may be the Montaigu cooling event c. 103 ka ago. The revised palaeoenvironmental interpretation shows that the development during the three discussed warmer intervals is well in line with the central European vegetational development. Our palaeoenvironmental interpretations concerning Ropersdorf-Schoningen and Brorup warm intervals are preliminary and will need further investigations. No indisputable Middle Weichselian (approximate to MIS 3, 57-29 ka) sedimentary record seems to have been recorded in the studied area. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	HENDRY, GS; TOTH, A				HENDRY, GS; TOTH, A			SOME EFFECTS OF LAND-USE ON BACTERIOLOGICAL WATER-QUALITY IN A RECREATIONAL LAKE	WATER RESEARCH												A study was conducted to detect the source of fecal indicator bacteria and the resulting degree of bacteriological water quality impairment of Mississippi Lake, a shallow eutrophic lake in southern Ontario, Canada. The lake was intensively sampled during two 5-day periods in late May-early June, and in July of 1976. The main detectable fecal coliform sources were cattle watering sites, farms, public beaches, some flooded and substandard septic tanks and a bird sanctuary. The impairment of water quality was localized to shoreline locations near the suspected source of the input of bacteria. After rainfall, about a 10-fold increase was noted in the levels of fecal coliforms [FC] and fecal streptococci in all lake surface water sampled. The effect was short-lived, lasting only 2 or 3 days after the main rainfall. The levels of indicator bacteria were low and did not exceed maximum levels set down for Water Quality Management in Ontario, of 1000 total coliforms/100 ml and 100 FC/100 ml at recreational areas. For this lake and 6 others in southern Ontario, the log of spring densities of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria correlated significantly with the log of mean summer chlorophyll a concentration (r = 0.80). Cottagers on Mississippi Lake were surveyed for their swimming habits and for the incidence of disease associated with swimming. The largest cause of disease associated with bathing, 57 of 67 reported infections, was infection of the ear; 3.28% of bathers at shoreline cottages suffered ear infections. The frequency of ear infections in the population of swimmers was significantly associated with the amount of swimming in the lake. Males and females were infected at equal rates. Young people suffered a significantly higher rate of ear infections than adult bathers. Frequency of water contact was probably greater in young people than in adults and may explain the greater number of ear infections in young swimmers. These studies provided the basis for recommendations designed to improve lakewater quality.

Facies analysis for the Neoarchean Itchen and Sherpa formations of the Winter Lake greenstone belt, Slave craton, Northwest Territories, Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												There are numerous Neoarchean metasedimentary rock packages in the Slave craton, and they serve as important archives of tectonic processes. Little is documented on the Neoarchean sedimentary packages of the Winter Lake greenstone belt of the central Slave craton, however, and their interpretation can aid in the understanding of the final stages of Slave craton amalgamation. This project investigates the depositional environments and tectonic settings of the Itchen Formation and Sherpa Formation of the Winter Lake greenstone belt. Our study provides constraints for reconstructing the Neoarchean evolution of the central Slave craton through bedrock mapping and facies analysis. The Itchen Formation consists of submature mudstone, siltstone, and sandstone, with preserved graded bedding, planar bedding, and flame structures. Unconformably overlying the Itchen Formation is the Sherpa Formation, which is dominated by polymictic conglomerates and coarse-grained sandstones with preserved cross-bedding, imbricated clasts, and scour surfaces. The Itchen Formation is interpreted to have been deposited in a convergent basin (i.e., retro-arc foreland basin), where two facies associations outline turbidite and suspension sedimentation consistent with submarine fan deposition on a continental slope and a basin floor environment. By contrast, the Sherpa Formation has three facies associations representing dominantly alluvial-fluvial environments in terrestrial- marine-lacustrine settings deposited in pull-apart basins resulting from transtensional forces associated with the Beniah fault zone.

J	ENGEL, S				ENGEL, S			EURASIAN WATERMILFOIL AS A FISHERY MANAGEMENT TOOL	FISHERIES												Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.) poses new challenges to fishery managers as it continues to spread and multiply in North American waters. Some of its effects can be detrimental to fisheries. When dense, the plant obstructs swimming space of pelagic fishes, shelters too many juvenile fishes, and disrupts foraging movements of piscivores. In replacing native plants that harbor a diverse array of invertebrates, watermilfoil creates food shortages for fishes. By blocking sunlight penetration and water movements, it depletes dissolved oxygen inshore that can cause fish kills when shoots decay in autumn. Therefore, lakes with healthy native plants should be left undisturbed and guarded against infestations of Eurasian watermilfoil. But the same plant in other lakes can improve fish production, especially in waters too turbid to support native plant growth. By increasing the surface area for invertebrate colonization, Eurasian watermilfoil expands the food base for benthivores and protects emerging year classes from piscivores. Through seasonal growth and senescence, it creates a dynamic littoral zone where openings in plant beds appear and disappear, cruising lanes for piscivores come and go, and edge effect for crappies expands and shrinks.																			0363-2415					MAR	1995	20	3					20	27		10.1577/1548-8446(1995)020<0020:EWAAFM>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8446(1995)020<0020:EWAAFM>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1995QK57000005
J	Head, RM; Jones, RI; Bailey-Watts, AE				Head, RM; Jones, RI; Bailey-Watts, AE			Vertical movements by planktonic cyanobacteria and the translocation of phosphorus: implications for lake restoration	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. Vertical movements of cyanobacteria during summer stratification were studied in Cauldshiels Loch, a small dimictic temperate lake. 2. Filaments of the three species of cyanobacteria dominant in the summer phytoplankton were recorded moving vertically in both directions, by simple traps deployed just below the thermocline. 3. These phytoplankters could potentially exploit opposing ends of the vertical light/nutrient gradient that existed in the water column during stratification. 4. The hypolimnion and water overlying the sediments were enriched by phosphorus released from the sediments. This internal loading to the lake provides a source of phosphorus available to migrating cyanobacteria to sustain production and growth in the epilimnion. 5. In this study, cyanobacteria filaments moving from the hypolimnion were found to be translocating phosphorus to the epilimnion. 6. Following reduction of external phosphorus loading, utilization of such internal phosphorus sources may delay expected reductions of bloom-forming cyanobacterial communities, and consequent improvements in other aspects of water quality.

In waste cornfields, diet was established by examining the esophageal contents of birds shot while feeding, whereas in grasslands, diet was determined by microhistological analysis of plant fragments found in droppings. Corn accounted for >95% of the diet of both species when feeding in cornfields. Grasses, especially Phleum pratense, dominated the diet of both species in all grassland habitats (>86%), whereas legumes represented <5%. The relative proportions of some food items differed between the species but constituted only a small portion of the overall diet. The high degree of similarity in the diets of these two species when feeding in the same habitats suggests that there is little ecological segregation and, thus, potential for competition. Feeding by geese in cornfields has no impact on the subsequent crop yield. Although grazing can decrease harvestable biomass, this is presently unlikely in the Lake St. Pierre area because of the pattern of habitat use by geese.

Oxygen decay rates were functions of macrophyte biomass, percentage littoral area, and total phosphorus and ranged from 0.006 to 0.216 mg O-2 m(-3) d(-1). Oxygen decay rates were similar to4 times higher in shallow polymictic lakes compared to deep, stratified lakes. Within shallow lakes, those classified as turbid had decay rates similar to1.5 times higher than those classified as clear. Chlorophyll a was not a predictor of the oxygen decay rate in shallow lakes; however, macrophyte-derived carbon averaged similar to150 times more than phytoplankton-derived carbon in the shallow lakes we examined. Reasons that lakes frequently or never become anoxic are related to productivity and morphometry; however, processes explaining occasional anoxia appear not to be related to factors we measured.																			0024-3590					JUL	2003	48	4					1633	1642		10.4319/lo.2003.48.4.1633	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2003.48.4.1633													WOS:000184247900027
J	Okan, ÖÖ; Güven, A				Okan, Ozlem Oztekin; Guven, Atahan			Hydrochemistry of groundwaters from alluvial and fractured igneous aquifers at the western region of Lake Hazar (Elaz, Turkey)	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The study area is located at Eastern Anatolian Fault Zone and at the western shore of Lake Hazar (Elazig, Turkey). This study aims to identify the hydrochemical features of groundwaters from fractured igneous aquifers and to correlate them with the alluvial aquifer's groundwaters. The water samples were collected in April and September during the rainy and dry periods, respectively. As a result of active tectonism in this region, hard rocks have gained secondary porosity and permeability. According to major ion composition, the fractured igneous and alluvial aquifer groundwaters can be grouped into the Ca-Mg-HCO3 type, whereas the groundwaters emerging very close to the thrust fault locations can be classified as the Mg-Ca-HCO3 type. The water-rock interaction process represents the primary factor controlling the hydrochemistry of the investigated groundwaters. Generally, the alluvial aquifer's groundwaters are characterized by low pH values. Clay minerals in the alluvial material may act as H+ buffers and cause decreased pH values. According to the isotopic tracers of O-18, H-2, and H-3, the spring water discharging at higher altitudes from the fractured igneous aquifer reflects rapid circulation and recharging from recent precipitation compared to alluvial aquifer groundwater. The groundwaters' major ions fall well within the permissible limits for drinking water in Turkey. In contrast, the NO3- and NH4+ concentrations from groundwaters, especially those recharging from fractured igneous aquifers, are very close to or in excess of the limit values. The high concentrations of NO3- and NH4+ in groundwaters presumably result from landfills and the use of agricultural fertilizers in the study area. The surface waters (Lake Hazar and man-made wetland (MMW)) also are investigated within the scope of the hydrochemistry studies. Higher TDS, Cl-, and Na+ concentrations in the MMW reflect salinity that could result from lake water intrusion and evaporation processes.

This biodiversity-rich lake supports many aquatic and terrestrial species, including some globally threatened species. The lake is important to the livelihood of the local population as it provides opportunities for fishing and collection of other wetland biological resources. As a consequence, quality of water in this lake is important both economically and environmentally. In the present study, therefore, water quality of Deepor Beel was assessed with different Water Quality Indices in each month for 3 years. Qualitative and quantitative water quality trends of the lake were assessed from those data. The overall water quality of the lake was evaluated as fair (NSF WQI 55-76) with some deterioration during summer (NSF WQI 55-69). The lake was found to be somewhat turbid (11-34 NTU) and eutrophic (Nitrate 1.46-5.75 ppm, Phosphate 0.08-0.47 ppm) throughout the study period. This study also indicated a slight gradual deterioration of the lake every year during summer and post monsoon. Water quality of Deepor Beel was found to deteriorate with time from this study. Better management plan of this lake should be implemented for its sustenance.

J	Romare, P				Romare, P			Growth of larval and juvenile perch: the importance of diet and fish density	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												In August, growth rate of young-of-the-year (YOY) perch in lake enclosures could be explained by both YOY density and mean cladoceran biomass, suggesting that in a lake where YOY perch are dominant, growth may be density dependent in late summer and mediated through top-down control on daphnid biomass. In June, growth rate of YOY perch could not be fully explained by YOY density or by mean cladoceran biomass, suggesting that growth and survival during the first part of the summer is negatively affected by a diet of Bosmina and cyclopoid copepods only. The experiments also suggest why YOY perch have a slow growth and a low abundance in eutrophic lakes where small zooplankton dominate. The June experiment also indicated that growth of late larval or early juvenile perch improved when a larger cladoceran became available and was included in the diet.

J	Xu, J; Huang, C; Huang, X				Xu, Jin; Huang, Chao; Huang, Xin			Holocene East Asian Summer Monsoon Variation Recorded by Sensitive Grain Size Component from the Pearl River-Derived Mud in the Northern South China Sea	LITHOSPHERE												To better understand the environmental significance of sediment grain size in continental shelf of the South China Sea (SCS), we carried out a detailed grain size study of sediments from the YJ Core, derived from the mud deposits of the northern SCS. Based on the grain size-standard deviation method, two sensitive grain size components were identified, namely, component 1 (8.2 similar to 9.3 mu m) and component 2 (106.8 similar to 120.7 mu m), respectively. The results indicate that the sensitive component 1 is likely to derive from fine-grained materials of the Pearl River. These fine-grained materials could be transported by the southwestward coastal current during the wet season, with the domination of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). Accordingly, the sensitive component 1 could be sensitive to climate change and has a great potential to reconstruct details of EASM variations. During the period of 7500-6800 cal yr BP, the sensitive component 1 may be controlled by both sea level change and EASM intensity. Besides, the curve of the sensitive component 1 in the YJ Core presents a strong EASM during the interval 68003500 cal yr BP and a weak EASM during the period of 3500-2000 cal yr BP, which is synchronous with other paleoclimate records in southern China. In the past 2000 years, the sensitive component 1 may reflect the increasing of human activities. It is essential to carry out more studies with higher resolution in mud areas to clarify a detailed historical evolution of EASM intensity over the whole Holocene.					; Huang, Chao/KXR-5743-2024	Xu, Jin/0000-0002-6985-9038; 													1941-8264	1947-4253				AUG	2022	2022				9				6064591	10.2113/2022/6064591	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/2022/6064591													WOS:000891894100001

Hydrochemical compositions and B isotope characteristics of different waters were collected around the GHSL, including the river water, stream water, spring water, salt-lake brine, intercrystalline brine, well water, drilling brine, and solar pond brine. The hydrochemical signatures suggest that silicates, carbonates and evaporates are the main B-bearing rocks during the water dynamic. The reservoir estimation of B resources shows that the Kulamulekesay River (KLMR) and the Atekan River (ATKR) contribute annually 18.3 tons and 22.84 tons of B, respectively, with a total amount of 11.72 x 10(4) tons of B during the past 5.7 ka. In comparison with the known B reservoir (32.96 x 10(4) tons) in the GHSL, a significant amount of B in the GHSL was probably recharged from deep fluids and sediments around the GHSL. The B concentration and B-enrichment degree are shaped by the evaporation process, which are highly elevated at the carnallite and bischofite stages.

Palaemonetes argentinus is omnivorous, feeding mainly on members of littoral benthic communities. The bulk of the stomach contents comprised algae, plant remains, oligochaetes, dipteran larvae, and a variety of organisms ranging from Rotifera to Palaemonidae. Zooplankton (rotifers, copepods, and cladocerans) were an alternative food source in winter, at low water, when macrophyte abundance had declined. In general, Oligochaeta and dipteran larvae were positively selected, Rotifera and microcrustaceans negatively, and algae indifferently, but with some variations depending on the seasons.

J	Liao, MN; Li, K; Sun, WW; Ni, J				Liao, Mengna; Li, Kai; Sun, Weiwei; Ni, Jian			Different facets of dry-wet patterns in south-western China over the past 27 000 years	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Frequently occurring mega-droughts under current global climate change have attracted broad social attention. A paleoclimatic perspective is needed to increase our understanding of the causes and effects of droughts. South-western (SW) China has been threatened by severe seasonal droughts. Our current knowledge of millennial-scale dry and wet phases in this region is primarily based on the variability of the Indian summer monsoon. However, water availability over land does not always follow patterns of monsoonal precipitation but also depends on water loss from evaporation and transpiration. Here, we reconstructed precipitation intensity, lake hydrological balance and the soil water stress index (SWSI) for the last 27 000 years. Grain size, geochemical and pollen records from Yilong Lake reveal the long-term relationships and inconsistencies of dry-wet patterns in meteorological, hydrological and soil systems in the central Yunnan region, SW China. Our results show that the long-term trends among precipitation, hydrological balance and soil moisture varied through time. The hydrological balance and soil moisture were primarily controlled by temperature-induced evaporation change during periods of low precipitation such as the Last Glacial Maximum and Younger Dryas. During periods of high precipitation (the early to late Holocene), intensified evaporation from the lake surface offset the effects of increased precipitation on the hydrological balance. However, abundant rainfall and the dense vegetation canopy circumvented a soil moisture deficit that might have resulted from rising temperature. In conclusion, the hydrological balance in the central Yunnan region was more sensitive to temperature change while soil moisture could be further regulated by vegetation changes over millennial timescales. Therefore, under future climate warming, the surface water shortage in the central Yunnan region may become even more serious. Our study suggests that reforestation efforts may provide some relief to soil moisture deficits in this region.

J	Bergström, AK; Blomqvist, P; Jansson, M				Bergström, AK; Blomqvist, P; Jansson, M			Effects of atmospheric nitrogen deposition on nutrient limitation and phytoplankton biomass in unproductive Swedish lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We used chemical data (3,907 lakes) and phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) data (225 lakes) from Swedish lake monitoring programs to assess the effects of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition on nutrient limitation and phytoplankton biomass in unproductive Swedish lakes. There was a clear north-south gradient of increasing lake concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, which was related to the pattern of atmospheric N input. On the basis of positive relationships between total phosphorus (P) concentrations and phytoplankton biomass we conclude that lakes in areas of enhanced N deposition are mainly P limited during summer. This relationship was not detected in lakes in pristine areas with low N deposition, which, together with experimental evidence from the literature, suggest possible N limitation. During summer, lakes in high N-deposition areas had clearly higher phytoplankton biomass relative to the total phosphorus concentrations compared to lakes in low N-deposition areas. Thus, in Swedish unproductive lakes, high atmospheric N input is reflected by increased lake concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and, possibly, by a shift from natural N limitation of phytoplankton to P limitation. Our results also reveal that increased N input has caused a eutrophication with higher phytoplankton biomass as the result.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	2005	50	3					987	994		10.4319/lo.2005.50.3.0987	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2005.50.3.0987													WOS:000229243700023
J	Hines, NA; Brezonik, PL				Hines, Neal A.; Brezonik, Patrick L.			Mercury inputs and outputs at a small lake in northern Minnesota	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Storages and cycling of total mercury (Hg-T), methylmercury (MeHg), and Hg-0 are described for Spring Lake, a small bog lake in the Marcell Experimental Forest in north-central Minnesota. We quantified photoredox transformations, MeHg photolysis, burial to the sediments, and internal and external loadings of Hg-T and MeHg. Atmospheric deposition was the main input of Hg-T; MeHg was supplied by a combination of atmospheric, near-shore wetland, and biotic ( methylation) sources. Hg-T outputs were dominated by burial (67%), and Hg-0 evasion accounted for 26% of Hg-T outputs. The watershed of Spring Lake is small (3.7 x lake surface area), and accordingly, bog and upland runoff were minor contributors to both Hg-T and MeHg inputs. Wet deposition was similar to 9% of total MeHg input, and other external inputs ( runoff, sediment porewater) provided only an additional 7%, indicating that internal production of MeHg was occurring in the lake. Photolysis of MeHg, measured in the field and laboratory, removed similar to 3 x the lake mass of MeHg ( 20 mg) annually, and was the dominant sink for MeHg. Residence times of MeHg and Hg-T in the lake were 48 and 61 days, respectively, during the open-water season, compared with only 8 days for the residence time of MeHg on settling particles ( seston). Photoreduction of Hg2+ to Hg-0 was greater than the reverse reaction (Hg-0 photooxidation), and the residence time of Hg-0 in the photic zone was short ( hours). Data from this study show active cycling of all the measured species of mercury (Hg-T, MeHg, and Hg-0) and the importance of MeHg photolysis and photo-redox processes.

Statistical correlation and principle analysis were applied to find the connection between tracer metals in water bodies and the various environmental factors. The percentage of soil particle size (5-50 mu m), which can reflect the intensity of the freeze-thaw process in the permafrost soil, influenced the soil and water As and Pb trace metal concentrations differently in the permafrost area. New hydrological insights for the region: In April, the average As concentrations were 23.4 +/- 16.7, 39.4 +/- 32.6, 26.5 +/- 24.4 mu g/L, respectively in river, lake and spring water samples, and Pb concentrations were 34.9 +/- 27.1, 47.4 +/- 38 and 48.9 +/- 33.4 mu g/L. While the As concentrations in waters in July all decreased by 2 or 3 times compared with those in April, Pb concentrations slightly increased. Permafrost thawing enhanced the weathering of As and Pb, but the high As adsorption on fine soil particles, resulting from the seasonal freeze-thaw cycles, leaded to the significant decrease in the water As concentration in July, in addition to the rainfall dilution. The slight increase in Pb water concentration in July suggesting the effects of enhanced weathering and dilution were equally important. The higher As and Pb concentrations around the large Gyaring and Ngoring lakes than other SAYR area, shaping the spatial distribution of As and Pb, might be due to evaporative enrichment and the high phosphate content in the lakes. Results are helpful in assessing the ecological impact of trace metals in the permafrost area with climate change.

However, there has been limited discussion and evaluation regarding how the elevated shoreline indicates the formation of mega-paleolakes and the effects of glacial meltwater on rising lake levels. In this study, we conducted an investigation into the well-preserved paleoshorelines of Rinqen Shubtso, a closed-basin lake system located on the southern TP. By utilizing 14C dating and analyzing shoreline elevations, the Holocene lake-level fluctuation history of Rinqen Shubtso was reconstructed. Through examining strontium (87Sr/86Sr) and oxygen isotopes (delta 18O), as well as Rb/Sr ratios in tufa samples from the shoreline, we evaluated the relative contribution of glacial meltwater and East Asian Monsoon precipitation to the lake-level expansion throughout this period. Our findings indicate that prior to 8.5 cal ka BP, the lake level reached its highest elevation before experiencing a rapid drop by approximately 44 m within a short timeframe. Subsequently, maintaining a stable highstand between 8.5 and 5.8 cal ka BP before gradually declining to its present elevation thereafter. We argue that the glacial meltwater induced by rising temperature due to solar insolation likely played a significant role in contributing to these large amplitude high lake levels prior to 8.5 cal ka BP, whereas the maximum East Asian Monsoon precipitation was responsible for sustaining high water levels during 8.5-5.8 cal ka BP when the mean latitudinal position of the summer Inter-tropical Convergence Zone shifted northward until reached its northernmost point at 8.5 cal ka BP. Following 5.8 cal ka BP, with the weakening of summer monsoon precipitation observed, gradually decreased lake level occurred accordingly. Our results provide valuable insights into understanding past changes in lake level, which are of great importance to predicting future lake variations on the TP.

J	Riding, R				Riding, R			Microbial carbonates: the geological record of calcified bacterial-algal mats and biofilms	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Deposits produced by microbial growth and metabolism have been important components of carbonate sediments since the Archaean. Geologically best known in seas and lakes, microbial carbonates are also important at the present day in fluviatile, spring, cave and soil environments. The principal organisms involved are bacteria, particularly cyanobacteria, small algae and fungi, that participate in the growth of microbial biofilms and mats. Grain-trapping is locally important, but the key process is precipitation, producing reefal accumulations of calcified microbes and enhancing mat accretion and preservation. Various metabolic processes, such as photosynthetic uptake of CO2 and/or HCO3- by cyanobacteria, and ammonification, denitrification and sulphate reduction by other bacteria, can increase alkalinity and stimulate carbonate precipitation. Extracellular polymeric substances, widely produced by microbes for attachment and protection, are important in providing nucleation sites and facilitating sediment trapping. Microbial carbonate microfabrics are heterogeneous. They commonly incorporate trapped particles and in situ algae and invertebrates, and crystals form around bacterial cells, but the main component is dense, clotted or peloidal micrite resulting from calcification of bacterial cells, sheaths and biofilm, and from phytoplankton-stimulated whiting nucleation. Interpretation of these texturally convergent and often inscrutable fabrics is a challenge. Conspicuous accumulations are large domes and columns with laminated (stromatolite), clotted (thrombolite) and other macrofabrics, which may be either agglutinated or mainly composed of calcified or spar-encrusted microbes. Stromatolite lamination appears to be primary, but clotted thrombolite fabrics can be primary or secondary. Microbial precipitation also contributes to hot-spring travertine, cold-spring mound, calcrete, cave crust and coated grain deposits, as well as influencing carbonate cementation, recrystallization and replacement. Microbial carbonate is biologically stimulated but also requires favourable saturation state in ambient water, and thus relies uniquely on a combination of biotic and abiotic factors. This overriding environmental control is seen at the present day by the localization of microbial carbonates in calcareous streams and springs and in shallow tropical seas, and in the past by temporal variation in abundance of marine microbial carbonates. Patterns of cyanobacterial calcification and microbial dome formation through time appear to reflect fluctuations in seawater chemistry. Stromatolites appeared at similar to 3450 Ma and were generally diverse and abundant from 2800 to 1000 Ma. Inception of a Proterozoic decline, variously identified at 2000, 1000 and 675 Ma, has been attributed to eukaryote competition and/or reduced lithification. Thrombolites and dendrolites mainly formed by calcified cyanobacteria became important early in the Palaeozoic, and reappeared in the Late Devonian. Microbial carbonates retained importance through much of the Mesozoic, became scarcer in marine environments in the Cenozoic, but locally re-emerged as large agglutinated domes, possibly reflecting increased algal involvement, and thick micritic reef crusts in the late Neogene. Famous modern examples at Shark Bay and Lee Stocking Island are composite coarse agglutinated domes and columns with complex bacterial-algal mats occurring in environments that are both stressed and current-swept: products of mat evolution, ecological refugia, sites of enhanced early lithification or all three?																			0037-0746	1365-3091				FEB	2000	47			1			179	214		10.1046/j.1365-3091.2000.00003.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3091.2000.00003.x													WOS:000087107300007

In addition, interpreting lake sediment records in terms of paleohydrology is complicated by human presence during Roman and Medieval settlements, which increased soil erosion and lake eutrophication. Here, we present a similar to 4440-year long sediment record from Schliersee, Bavaria, where we applied compound-specific delta H-2 on leaf waxes, geochemical and diatom analyses to reconstruct hydrology and lake productivity. The terrestrial delta H-2(n-C31) records the isotopic composition of precipitation and is similar to leaf wax delta H-2 from Lake Ghirla, southern Alps, and delta O-18 from Spannagel cave in Austria. This provides evidence that, on millennial time scales, changes in moisture sources associated with shifts in the position of the Westerlies are one potential explanation regarding the isotope signals across the region. However, doubts remain whether the North Atlantic Oscillation as a winter signal can explain variations in summer-sensitive biomarker delta H-2 records. The aquatic delta H-2(n-C25) records the isotopic composition of lake water and its isotopic offset to delta H-2(n-C31) (Delta(aq-terr)) is applied as a proxy for lake evaporation. We find increased evaporation during the Medieval Climate Anomaly in line with a drought reported from tree-ring studies, whereas lower evaporation prevailed during the Little Ice Age, likely due to solar forcing. Lake productivity was higher during the Roman period and Middle Ages, concomitant with land use resulting in higher nutrient inputs into the lake. The intensified use of industrial fertilizers and the drainage of untreated wastewater after the Second World War caused eutrophication during the 1950s. Despite its paleoclimatic significance, this study emphasizes that multi-proxy approaches combining assemblages of geochemical and biological proxies allow robust reconstructions of climate-landscape interactions and human impact.

These studies rely upon chronic, averaged measures of air pollution, which fosters a static conception of exposure disparities. This paper examines PM2.5 exposure disparities in Salt Lake County (SLC), Utah public schools under three different PM2.5 scenarios-relatively clean air, a moderate winter persistent cold air pool (PCAP), and a major winter PCAP-with respect to race/ethnicity, economic deprivation, student age, and school type. We pair demographic data for SLC schools (n = 174) with modelled PM2.5 values, obtained from a distributed network of sensors placed through a community-university partnership. Results from generalized estimating equations controlling for school district clustering and other covariates reveal that patterns of social inequality vary under different PM2.5 pollution scenarios. Charter schools and schools serving economically deprived students experienced disproportionate exposure during relatively clean air and moderate PM2.5 PCAP conditions, but those inequalities attenuated under major PCAP conditions. Schools with higher proportions of racial/ethnic minority students were unequally exposed under all PM2.5 pollution scenarios, reflecting the robustness of racial/ethnic disparities in exposure. The findings speak to the need for policy changes to protect school-aged children from environmental harm in SLC and elsewhere.					; Mullen, Casey/GVS-4214-2022; Xing, Wei/K-4970-2014; Goffin, Pierre/AAW-2722-2021	XING, WEI/0000-0002-3177-8478; Mullen, Casey/0000-0002-4217-272X; 													0013-9351	1096-0953				JUL	2020	186								109543	10.1016/j.envres.2020.109543	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.109543								32348936					WOS:000548186300073

Paleomonsoonal shifts during ∼13700 to 3100 yr BP in the central Ganga Basin, India with a severe arid phase at ∼4.2 ka	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												We present a multiproxy record of grain size and stable carbon isotope from the Lilaur lake, Ganga Basin, India to understand the history of lake formation linked to changes in Indian monsoon precipitation during similar to 13714 to 3073 calibrated year before Present (cal yr BP). A comparison is made between Lilaur lake proxy record with those from other parts of South Asia as well as North Atlantic to understand extent and causes of monsoon variability and its influence on the fauna and flora of the region. Chronology of lake core was constrained using AMS C-14 and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates. This study suggests a transition from river to lake during similar to 5800 to 5189 cal yr BP which is supported by reduced precipitation with weakening of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM). This river to lake transition culminated in a severe arid phase during 4250 to 4050 cal yr BP (4.2 ka event), corresponding to enhanced El Nino activity, southward shift of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone, and aridification of India when the ISM was weak.					; Kumar, Pankaj/AAD-2135-2019; Kumar, Pankaj/M-8612-2015; Bhaumik, Ajoy K/N-6343-2019	Bhaumik, Ajoy K./0000-0002-6217-8061; Kumar, Pankaj/0000-0001-7050-582X; 													1040-6182	1873-4553				AUG 20	2022	629						65	73		10.1016/j.quaint.2021.01.015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2021.01.015		JUN 2022											WOS:000833419900002
J	Turner, AM; Cholak, EJ; Groner, M				Turner, Andrew M.; Cholak, Emily J.; Groner, Maya			Expanding American Lotus and Dissolved Oxygen Concentrations of a Shallow Lake	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Lakes and reservoirs often experience sudden increases in macrophyte biomass. These changes have the potential to alter the abiotic environment in ways that affect other species. The American lotus (Nelumbo lutea) is expanding its distribution across portions of North America. N. In lea forms a dense canopy over the shallow margins of lakes and may influence the abiotic properties of the littoral zone, but this hypothesis has not been tested. Here we investigate the effects of a growing bed of N. lutea on water quality in Pymatuning Reservoir. In summer 2007 we deployed remote logging sensors to measure dissolved oxygen and temperature inside of a N. lutea bed and in adjacent open water. Dissolved oxygen concentrations were consistently lower in the lotus bed than in open water and oxygen concentrations within the N. lutea bed declined over the course of the summer. In Jul. and Aug. the N. lutea beds experienced hypoxia while oxygen concentrations remained high in open water. Low dissolved oxygen levels in N. ham beds may affect the distribution of fish and invertebrates and alter biochemical processes in the epibenthos.

One of the lakes, Hymenjaure, was fertilized with P in 1972-1974 and with both P and N in 1975. The emergent vegetation in the lakes consisted mainly of C. rostrata Stokes and E. fluviatile L. The maximum shoot biomass of C. rostrata varied between 12-25 g dry wt. m-2 during the investigation years, corresponding figures for E. fluviatile were 10-21 g dry wt. m-2. The yearly shoot production of the emergent macrophytes ranged from 6-21 g dry wt. m-2 during the study. The natural variations in growth of both species between the years were mainly regulated by summer temperature. C. rostrata was able to benefit from increased P supply, when more shoots were produced within its stands. Growth of individual shoots, though, was still regulated by summer temperature. E. fluviatile increased its P uptake as an effect of the fertilizations, but production was not affected.																			0304-3770	1879-1522					1983	15	4					349	366		10.1016/0304-3770(83)90003-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(83)90003-7													WOS:A1983QQ63500003
J	Chow-Fraser, P				Chow-Fraser, P			Seasonal, interannual, and spatial variability in the concentrations of total suspended solids in a degraded coastal wetland of Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A 4-year (1993 through 1996) monitoring program examined the distribution of total suspended solids (TSS) in Cootes Paradise Marsh, a shallow (mean depth of 70 cm), degraded drowned-rivermouth marsh of Lake Ontario. Monthly meteorological and hydrographical data from 1986 through 1996 revealed a hydrologically dynamic system that exhibited large seasonal and interannual variation with respect to precipitation amount, discharge volume, and water levels; the prevailing winds were shown to be oriented along the length of the marsh. Interannual variation in TSS concentrations was inversely related to mean seasonal water levels that fluctuated 45 cm over the II years. In a stepwise regression analysis, planktonic chlorophyll-a concentration only explained 2% of the variation in TSS, while inorganic and non-algal organic solids explained 70% and 18%; respectively. Mean seasonal water turbidity increased significantly with mean seasonal wind speed at 17 sampling stations during 1993 and 1994. Runoff from a summer rainstorm more than doubled water turbidities at the mouth of all three creeks over the first 36 hours. In enclosure experiments, water turbidity increased proportionately with biomass of benthivorous fish (especially common carp, Cyprinus carpio). When wind and carp disturbance were compared simultaneously in the field, wind speed accounted for 41% of the variation in turbidity while presence of carp explained an additional 21%. The overall temporal and spatial distribution of TSS in the marsh reflect ed changes in water level, wind activities, onset of Min events, and fish disturbance that acted in concert to keep Cootes Paradise Marsh extremely turbid throughout the summer.																			0380-1330						1999	25	4					799	813		10.1016/S0380-1330(99)70778-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(99)70778-1													WOS:000085976300016
J	Sanders, G; HamiltonTaylor, J; Jones, KC				Sanders, G; HamiltonTaylor, J; Jones, KC			PCB and PAH dynamics in a small rural lake	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Sediment traps were deployed for periods of 4-5 weeks between May 1990 and September 1991 at depths of 6.5 and 12.5 m in a 15 m deep, rural U.K. lake. Trap material was quantitatively analyzed for 14 PAH compounds, 43 PCB congeners, particle mass, and C and N contents. Derived depositional fluxes of total PAHs (11.7 mg m(-2) yr(-1)) and total PCBs (289 and 463 mu g m(-2) yr(-1) at 6.5 and 12.5 m, respectively) are at the upper ends of the ranges reported in other comparable studies. The annual fluxes of individual PAH compounds are generally similar to accumulation rates determined for surface sediments at the same location, indicating the absence of significant recycling. The ratios of annual depositional fluxes to surface sediment accumulation rates are substantially greater than 1 in the case of phenanthrene (2.5) and PCBs (6.5-23). These relatively elevated fluxes combined with a consideration of particle dynamics in the lake suggest significant recycling between the sediments and water column, involving remobilization into solution accompanied by diffusive release. Recycling of PCBs tends to increase with increasing aqueous solubility. The depositional fluxes of PAHs and particle mass showed a similar seasonal dependence with the highest fluxes occurring in winter, when the water column was well-mixed. The high winter fluxes appear to be due to combination of high catchment-derived inputs (PAHs and particle mass) and atmospheric inputs (PAHs) and to sediment resuspension.					; Jones, Kevin/F-4296-2014	Jones, Kevin Christopher/0000-0001-7108-9776; 													0013-936X					OCT	1996	30	10					2958	2966		10.1021/es9509240	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es9509240													WOS:A1996VL04600031

The future of upland water ecosystems of the UK in the 21st century: A synthesis	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Upland waters are located upstream of the areas of direct human disturbance and intensive land use through industry, agriculture and urbanisation and are valued particularly as sources of potable water and as biodiverse freshwater habitats. Nonetheless, the impact of human activity can be detected even in some of the most remote lakes on the planet due to the effects of long-range transport of air pollutants and global climate change. In the UK, upland waters are threatened by a range of pressures including not only atmospheric deposition of acidic compounds, trace metals and organic pollutants, but also climate change, nutrient enrichment by deposited nitrogen and changing land-use or land management regimes. The threat from acid deposition has declined sharply since the 1980s but its legacy remains a major concern; recovery is taking place but even assuming a complete chemical and biological recovery to a pre-industrial baseline were possible, dynamic models suggest that this could take another 100 years. However, current climate change projections suggest that by then, UK upland waters will become much warmer, with lower summer streamflows, higher winter streamflows and a much reduced or even absent influence of snowfall and lake ice-cover. Hence there is no rationale for aspiring to the return of pre-industrial "reference" conditions because climate change is likely to shift the climatic baseline at an unprecedented rate. Meanwhile, expansion of forest planting, changing grazing regimes and management measures for peatland restoration, among other land-use pressure, will affect upland catchments in the UK with potentially major repercussions for aquatic ecosystems, both positive and negative. The challenge for scientists, policymakers and other stakeholders in the uplands is to determine not only the trajectory of change in upland waters, but also to define the ecological endpoints needed to provide the optimum range of ecosystem services for society. Integrated monitoring of the kind exemplified by the papers in this volume is a fundamental prerequisite in this regard. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The lake was sampled 19 times during 1990 and 1991. We first determined which populations contributed significantly to total summer biomass. Then, we determined the trophic role of these populations by several independent approaches, and aggregated the community into functional groups. The binary food web obtained indicated that Me structure of Me food web in Lake Ciso was similar to that found in other systems. Finally, we quantified Me trophic fluxes among populations using a simple algorithm which considers the vertical distribution of organisms and the functional responses of the different predators. The trophic food web obtained revealed 2 interesting properties. First, the compartments with larger biomass were relatively stable during stratification and presented slow growth and low predatory losses. Second, there was a very inefficient transfer of organic matter from the lower levels (bacteria, algae and protozoans) to the higher levels (rotifers and zooplankton) of the food web. Both properties could be explained by the fact that most biomass of the system accumulated in the metalimnion, along opposite gradients of oxygen and sulfide, which determined an environment with reduced competition and predation. We postulate that metalimnetic communities above anaerobic hypolimnia can be regarded as sinks of organic matter off the epilimnion.

Dissolved Mn(III) is a key redox intermediate in sediments of a seasonally euxinic coastal basin	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Manganese (Mn) is an essential micronutrient and key redox intermediate in marine systems. The role of organically complexed dissolved Mn(III) (dMn(III)-L) as an electron acceptor and donor in marine environments is still incompletely understood. Here, we use geochemical depth profiles of solutes and solids for the sediment and overlying waters and a reactive transport model to reconstruct the seasonality in sedimentary dMn(III)-L dynamics and benthic Mn release in a eutrophic, seasonally euxinic coastal basin (Lake Grevelingen, the Netherlands). Our model results suggest that dMn(III)-L is a major component of the dissolved Mn pool throughout the year. According to the model, there are three major sources of pore water dMn(III)-L when oxygen (O2) is present in the bottom water, namely reduction of Mn oxides coupled to the oxidation of Fe(II), reduction of Mn oxides coupled to organic matter degradation, and oxidation of Mn(II) with O2. Removal of pore water dMn(III)-L is inferred to primarily take place through reduction by dissolved Fe(II). When bottom waters are euxinic in summer, model-calculated rates of sedimentary Mn cycling decrease strongly because of a lower supply of Mn oxides. The dMn(III)-L transformations in summer mostly involve reactions with Fe(II) and organic matter. Modeled benthic release of Mn mainly occurs as dMn(III)-L when bottom waters are oxic, as Mn(II) upon initial bottom-water euxinia and as both Mn(II) and dMn(III)-L when the euxinia becomes persistent. Our model findings highlight strong interactions between the sedimentary Fe and Mn cycles. Dissolved Mn(III)-L is a relatively stable and mobile Mn species, compared to Mn(II), and is therefore more easily transported laterally throughout the coastal zone and possibly also to open marine waters.					; Slomp, Caroline/A-9406-2012; Klomp, Robin/HNS-2915-2023; Jetten, Mike/B-8834-2011	Zygadlowska, Olga/0000-0003-1457-4454; van Helmond, Niels/0000-0003-0024-7217; Lenstra, Wytze/0000-0003-0979-5594; Klomp, Robin/0009-0008-3588-6792													1726-4170	1726-4189				FEB 11	2025	22	3					751	765		10.5194/bg-22-751-2025	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-22-751-2025													WOS:001417430800001

Spatial variability of ice thickness on stormwater retention ponds	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												As integrated components of urban drainage networks, stormwater ponds receive runoff year-round. In cold regions, flow beneath ice covers transports heat and influences ice processes such that the spatial variability in ice thickness cannot be assumed to be similar to that of natural lakes. To evaluate the variability in ice thickness, four stormwater ponds were monitored over two winter seasons, including both direct measurements of ice thickness and indirect spatial surveys of ice thickness using ground penetrating radar (GPR). The 18 GPR surveys of ice thickness confirmed significant spatial variability in the ice thickness at all 4 study sites, with coefficients of variation in ice thickness ranging from 0.046 to 0.163. Pond bathymetry, the locations of inlets and outlets, and the locations of cleared ice rinks were found to be associated with changes in ice thickness. In 3 of the 4 study sites, ice covers at inlet basins were found to be significantly thinner than elsewhere in the ponds by up to 35.1%, whereas ice covers over outlet forebays were generally thicker, by up to 25.3%, than the pond average. Cleared ice rinks were found to have increased local ice thickness by 5-10 cm. Mid-winter thaw events were found to decrease the mean ice thickness and increase the spatial variability, with the change in ice thickness variability found to be positively correlated to the extent of bedfast ice preceding the thaw event. GPR was found to be an effective tool to map ice thickness on stormwater ponds; however, impurities and liquid water in the ice covers presented challenges and reduced the accuracy of the measurements. Values of relative permittivity ranging between 3.2 and 8.5 were calculated at locations where direct measurements of ice thickness were made, with the higher values consistently associated with thaw events.

The lacustrine sediment record from Torfdalsvatn, north Iceland, is the longest known in Iceland (similar to 12 000 cal yr BP), and along with its high sedimentation rate, it provides an opportunity to develop high-resolution quantitative records that address these challenges. In this study, we use two sediment cores from Torfdalsvatn to construct a detailed age model derived from marker tephra layers, paleomagnetic secular variation, and radiocarbon (20 age control points). We then apply this robust age constraint to support a complete tephrochronology (> 2200 grains analyzed in 33 tephra horizons) and sub-centennial geochemical (MS, TOC, C / N, delta 13C, and BSi) and algal pigment records (chlorins, lutein, diatoxanthin, and canthaxanthin). Along with previously published proxy records from the same lake, these records demonstrate generally stable terrestrial and aquatic conditions during the Early and Middle Holocene, except for punctuated disturbances linked to major tephra fall events. During the Late Holocene, there is strong evidence for naturally driven algal productivity decline beginning around 1800 cal yr BP. These changes closely follow regional Late Holocene cooling driven by decreases in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation and the expansion of sea-ice-laden Polar Water around Iceland. Then at 880 cal yr BP, similar to 200 years after the presumed time of human settlement, a second shift in the record begins and is characterized by a strong uptick in landscape instability and possibly soil erosion. Collectively, the Torfdalsvatn record highlights the resilience of low-elevation, low-relief catchments to the pre-settlement soil erosion in Iceland, despite a steadily cooling background climate. The precisely dated, high-resolution tephra and paleoenvironmental record from this site can serve as a regional template for lowland regions of north Iceland.

The large field of view of these instruments dictates that the observed brightness temperature can originate from heterogeneous land cover, with different vegetation and surface properties. In this study, we assess the influence of freshwater lakes on the observed brightness temperature of AMSR-E in winter conditions. The study focuses on the geographic region of Finland, where lakes account for 10% of the total terrestrial area. We present a method to mitigate for the influence of lakes through forward modeling of snow covered lakes, as a part of a microwave emission simulation scheme of space-borne observations. We apply a forward model to predict brightness temperatures of snow covered sceneries over several winter seasons, using available data on snow cover, vegetation and lake ice cover to set the forward model input parameters. Comparison of model estimates with space-borne observations shows that the modeling accuracy improves in the majority of examined cases when lakes are accounted for, with respect to the case where lakes are not included in the simulation. Moreover, we present a method for applying the correction to the retrieval of Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) in lake-rich areas, using a numerical inversion method of the forward model. In a comparison to available independent validation data on SWE, also the retrieval accuracy is seen to improve when applying the influence of snow covered lakes in the emission model.

Comparative studies of morphology revealed that the body shapes of the three polar diatoms were nearly identical to the known morphology of each species; however, they were considerably shorter in body length than previously described identical species from other locations. The 18S rDNA sequences of the diatoms were nearly identical to the same species from temperate and other regions. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the polar diatoms each formed a clade with their identical species and genera according to their taxonomic positions. This suggests that the polar diatoms may possess little or no genetic or morphological variation compared to more temperate strains.

Despite this fact, very little is known about use of dissolved carbohydrates by planktonic bacteria. We studied use of total dissolved carbohydrates (TDCHO) by planktonic bacteria in mesotrophic Lake Constance, Germany, from April until August 1992. We examined the decrease of TDCHO over time together with the increase of bacterial numbers in 1-mu m filtered lake water incubated at in situ temperature in the dark. TDCHO analyses were done after hydrolysis by sulfuric acid as free monosaccharides and oxidation by periodate to formaldehyde with 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone-hydrazon-hypochloride (MBTH). Preliminary tests showed that hydrolysis by sulfuric acid gave higher yields than hydrolysis by HCl. Our results show that TDCHO are readily used by bacteria and compose substantial fractions of the C requirements for their growth. Concentrations of TDCHO varied between 1.7 and 5.5 mu M (glucose equivalents), and use rates varied between 0.47 and 3.43 mu g C liter(-1) h(-1) Highest rates of TDCHO use occurred during the phytoplankton spring bloom, during the clear-water phase in June, and during a phytoplankton bloom in August. Ratios of use of TDCHO/bacterial biomass production varied between 0.17 and 3.05. During the spring bloom, TDCHO and total dissolved amino acids (TDAA) were used in equal amounts. During the clear-water phase at chlorophyll alpha concentrations <3 mu g liter(-1), however, bacteria only consumed TDCHO and excreted amino acids. The growth efficiency based on the consumption of TDCHO and TDAA varied between 16 and 21% during the phytoplankton spring bloom and was 35% during the clear-water phase.																			0095-3628					JAN-FEB	1996	31	1					41	55											24185635					WOS:A1996TG94000004

These maps are the first of their kind, and use data derived from 22 Lateglacial sites and 34 early Holocene sites. The isotherms are generated by weighted spatial interpolation (kriging). The major patterns of chironomid-inferred summer temperatures are spatially well-resolved in both the Lateglacial and early Holocene. The isotherm maps indicate that there was a strong west to east gradient during the Lateglacial Interstadial (GI-1) due to the influence of thermohaline circulation in the regions bordering the north Atlantic, which diminishes eastwards. A strong north to south temperature gradient is also apparent, particularly in eastern regions, influenced by the extent of the Scandinavian ice-cap. Peak temperatures are achieved early in the Interstadial in the south of the region but occur towards the end of the Interstadial in the north. Holocene warming varies spatially and temporally and is earliest in the south and east, but later in the north and west. During the period covered in our study maximum warmth is reached ca. 10 ka BP. The chironomid-based Lateglacial isotherm maps are compared with previously published isotherm maps from the same region based on beetle-inferred temperatures. While the trends shown in the two datasets are similar, beetle-inferred temperatures are often warmer than chironomid-inferred temperatures. This is especially marked in GI-1e and may be due to microclimatic effects causing the chironomids to underestimate air temperatures and/or the beetles to over-estimate air temperatures. The spatial coherence between sites in both the Lateglacial and early Holocene suggest that the chironomid-based temperature estimates are largely reliable, although data testing suggests that estimates from southern Scandinavia may be less reliable perhaps due to high topographical relief influencing local climate. More data points are required, particularly from northwest Scotland, southwest England and Wales, northeast France, Denmark, Finland and the Baltic States, to confirm trends and provide even coverage and a denser network of sites.

GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												To gain insights into the mechanisms of abrupt climate change within interglacials, we have examined the characteristics and spatial extent of a prominent, climatically induced vegetation setback during the Holsteinian interglacial (Marine Isotope Stage 11c). Based on analyses of pollen and varves of lake sediments from Dethlingen (northern Germany), this climatic oscillation, here termed the "Older Holsteinian Oscillation" (OHO), lasted 220 years. It can be subdivided into a 90-year-long decline of temperate tree taxa associated with an expansion of Pinus and herbs, and a 130-year-long recovery phase marked by the expansion of Betula and Alnus, and the subsequent recovery of temperate trees. The climate-induced nature of the OHO is corroborated by changes in diatom assemblages and delta O-18 measured on biogenic silica indicating an impact on the aquatic ecosystem of the Dethlingen paleolake. The OHO is widely documented in pollen records from Europe north of 50 degrees latitude and is characterized by boreal climate conditions with cold winters from the British Isles to Poland, with a gradient of decreasing temperature and moisture availability, and increased continentality towards eastern Europe. This pattern points to a weakened influence of the westerlies and/or a stronger influence of the Siberian High. A comparison of the OHO with the 8.2 ka event of the Holocene reveals close similarities regarding the imprint on terrestrial ecosystems and the interglacial boundary conditions. Hence, in analogy to the 8.2 ka event, a transient, meltwater-induced slowdown of the North Atlantic Deep Water formation appears as a plausible trigger mechanism for the OHO. If correct, meltwater release into the North Atlantic may be a more common agent of abrupt climate change during interglacials than previously thought. We conclude that meltwater-induced climate setbacks during interglacials preferentially occurred when low rates of summer insolation increase during the preceding terminations facilitated the persistence of large-scale continental ice-sheets well into the interglacials.

Habitat analyses indicated summer temperatures and dissolved oxygen concentrations were stressful to striped bass in Lake Anna and nonstressful to striped bass in Smith Mountain Lake. Summer ovary weights, condition factors, and body lengths and weights were significantly lower for Lake Anna striped bass than for Smith Mountain Lake fish. Total vitellolipid and total vitelloprotein concentrations did not differ significantly between the two samples, but concentrations of vitellotriglyceride and other esters and of certain component vitelloproteins were significantly greater in ovaries of Smith Mountain Lake striped bass. These data indicate bioenergetic stresses in Lake Anna did not significantly affect the quantity of vitellolipids and vitelloproteins sequestered by Lake Anna striped bass, but did significantly affect vitellolipid and vitelloprotein composition.																			0002-8487					JUL	1993	122	4					636	641		10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0636:NVAVPO>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0636:NVAVPO>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1993LW05400012

The ways in which primary productivity and the dynamics of planktonic algae species composition are related to these hydrochemical changes remains unclear, especially in karst waters with high pH and high concentrations of Ca2+ and dissolved inorganic C. In this study, we used the Shawan Karst Test Site, Puding, SW China to analyze the influences of the NO3-, PO43-, and CO2(aq) concentrations on the primary productivity and dynamics of planktonic algae species composition in five spring-fed ponds under different land use patterns at the site during 2018. Our results show the following. (1) Agricultural farming increased the input of NO3-, PO43-, and CO2(aq) from springs to the ponds (i.e., surface waters); meanwhile, shrub and grass lands reduced the input of NO3- and PO43-, but significantly increased the input of CO2(aq) to the water. (2) The total number of planktonic algal cells was mainly related to CO2(aq) in January (i.e., the dormant period), but mainly related to NO3- and PO(4)(3- )in July (i.e., the growth period); this possibly due to the seasonal succession of phytoplanktonic algae species sensitivity of different nutrient elements. (3) In the dormant period, the system is dominated by the phytoplanktonic algal cells sensitive toCO(2(aq)), especially in grass and shrub ponds. In the growth period, the system is dominated by the planktonic algal cells sensitive to NO3- and PO43-; however, they are far less than others in grass and shrub ponds. Thus, we predict that groundwaters with relatively high CO(2(aq) )and low NO3- and PO43- concentrations (resulting from natural afforestation in karst areas) may help alleviate eutrophication and increase C sequestration in the corresponding surface waters, indicating the importance of land-use adjustment in the management of water quality and carbon cycle.

We found 740 birds, of which 685 (92.6%) were at Lake Ellesmere/Te Waihora. We calculate that 15.8% of the estimated effective wrybill breeding population were displaced from breeding rivers by floods at this time. Our findings support the evaluation by Dowding & Moore (2006) that the network of wetlands along the Canterbury coast appears to be of critical importance to wrybill as breeding season flood refugia.																			0029-4470	1177-7680					2020	67	4			SI		765	771																WOS:000605722400020
J	Hansen, AM; Andersen, FO; Jensen, HS				Hansen, AM; Andersen, FO; Jensen, HS			Seasonal pattern in nutrient limitation and grazing control of the phytoplankton community in a non-stratified lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The relative importance of zooplankton grazing and nutrient limitation in regulating the phytoplankton community in the non-stratified Lake Kvie, Denmark, were measured nine times during the growing season. 2. Natural phytoplankton assemblage bioassays showed increasing importance of nutrient limitation during summer. Growth rates at ambient nutrient concentrations were continually below 0.12 per day, while co-enrichment with nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to above concentration-saturated conditions enhanced growth rates from May to the end of July. 3. Stoichiometric ratios of important elements in seston (C:N, C:P, N:P), in lake water (TN:TP) in external loading (TN:TP) and in internal loading (DIN:DIP) were measured to determine whether N or P could be the limiting nutrient. TN:TP molar ratio of both lake water, benthic fluxes and external loading suggested P limitation throughout the growing season. However, seston molar ratios suggested moderate P-deficiency only during mid-summer. 4. Abundance and community structure of the zooplankton varied considerably through the season and proved to be important in determining the responses of algal assemblages to grazing. High abundance of cladocerans and rotifers resulted in significant grazing impact, while cyclopoid copepods had no significant effect on the phytoplankton biomass. 5. Regeneration of ammonium and phosphate by zooplankton were periodically important for phytoplankton growth. A comparison of nutrient regeneration by zooplankton with nutrient inputs from sediment and external sources indicated that zooplankton may contribute significantly in supplying N and P for the growth of phytoplankton.

J	GURIJALA, KR; ALEXANDER, M				GURIJALA, KR; ALEXANDER, M			EXPLANATION FOR THE DECLINE OF BACTERIA INTRODUCED INTO LAKE WATER	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The sizes of the populations of individual bacterial species diminished following their addition to water from lakes with different trophic levels at temperatures of 5, 10, 15, and 30-degrees-C. Some species persisted after their initial reduction in cell numbers, but others were undetectable after 3 to 15 days. The decline of these introduced bacteria was not a result of their inoculation at higher densities than are found in nature. The death of most of the test species was not the result of starvation, abiotic factors, bdellovibrios, or bacteriophages. Despite the presence of lytic bacteria, the lake water did not have lytic activity against the test species. Protozoan predation was a significant factor in the fall in bacterial population sizes because protozoa increased in numbers as the bacterial density fell, the suppression of protozoa led to the elimination or delay of the decline of the bacteria, and the addition of protozoa to lake water in which indigenous protozoa were suppressed produced the same pattern of bacterial elimination as in untreated lake water.																			0095-3628						1990	20	3					231	244		10.1007/BF02543879	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02543879								24193976					WOS:A1990EQ56700002
J	RIDGWAY, MS; FRIESEN, TG				RIDGWAY, MS; FRIESEN, TG			ANNUAL VARIATION IN PARENTAL CARE IN SMALLMOUTH BASS, MICROPTERUS-DOLOMIEU	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												An eight year field study is summarized outlining variation in parental care in a northern population of smallmouth bass. Nesting males ranged in age from 4 to 12 + years old and ranged in size from 21 cm to 40 + cm in fork length. The age and size distributions were skewed right when strong year-classes entered the nesting stock. Larger males had more offspring in their nests than smaller males. The year-to-year variation in the duration of care was large and appears to be related to two general effects of water temperature. First, there was a significant positive relationship between the variation in spring spawning date and variation in the duration of parental care prior to swim-up of the larvae. This reflects the general effect of spring warming rate on the timing of nesting in each year. Second, in most years, there was a significant positive relationship between male size and the duration of parental care prior to swim-up. This reflects the consistent inverse relationship between male size and the seasonal timing of spawning in this population. The offspring of large males spawning early in a season take longer to develop than offspring of males nesting late in season. There is no relationship in most years between male size and duration of care after swim-up. Other factors unrelated to water temperature may be important in determining the duration of care after swim-up. In particular, ontogenetic changes in juvenile behaviour and energy depletion in nesters may be two important factors affecting care duration.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				NOV	1992	35	3					243	255		10.1007/BF00001890	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00001890													WOS:A1992JW38300004
J	Hancock, PL; Chalmers, RML; Altunel, E; Çakir, Z				Hancock, PL; Chalmers, RML; Altunel, E; Çakir, Z			Travitonics:: using travertines in active fault studies	JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY												Late Quaternary travertines deposited from hot springs can reveal much about the neotectonic attributes and histories of structures. On the basis of field studies in the Aegean region (Turkey and Greece), the northern Apennines (Italy) and the Basin and Range province (USA) we conclude that the following relationships are of predictive value: (i) travertine deposits are preferentially located along fracture traces, either immediately above extensional fissures or in the hanging walls of normal faults; (ii) the locations of many travertine fissure-ridge deposits coincide with step-over zones (relay ramps) between fault segments; networks of intersecting tensional fissures reflecting the complex strains experienced in such settings are probably responsible for enhancing hydrothermal flow; (iii) the morphology of travertine deposits overlying extensional fissures is controlled by the rheology of the underlying materials; tufa cones (towers, pinnacles) form on former and present lake hoots where fissures underlie unconsolidated sediments, whereas fissure-ridges develop where fissures cut bedrocks at the surface; (iv) fissure-ridges comprise outwardly dipping bedded travertine flanking a central tensional fissure filled by vertically banded travertines; fissures can be used to infer local stretching directions; (v) where there are travertines datable by the U-series method it is possible to calculate time-averaged dilation and lateral propagation rates for individual fissures; (vi) most fissures cutting fissure-ridges comprise self-similar angular segments with fractal dimensions in the range 1.00-1.12, the properties of bedded travertine combined with stress perturbations at fissure tips probably being responsible for such similar fractal dimensions being inferred from such a wide range of locations. Fissures gradually increasing in width with depth are products of continuous fracture dilation in contrast to those that form during episodic dilation which display stepped increases of width with depth; (vii) travertine deposited from springs along fault zones accumulate in terraced-mounds sited down slope of the spring line; (viii) many post-depositional fractures cutting travertine deposits are locally oriented at right angles to deposit margins; and (ix) systematic joints in travertines are restricted to those parts of eroded sheet deposits that have been exhumed.

J	Willett, CS; Leben, RR; Lavín, MF				Willett, Cynthia S.; Leben, Robert R.; Lavin, Miguel F.			Eddies and Tropical Instability Waves in the eastern tropical Pacific:: A review	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Mesoscale eddies and tropical instability waves in the eastern tropical Pacific, first revealed by satellite infrared imagery, play an important role in the dynamics and biology of the region, and in the transfer of mass, energy, heat, and biological constituents from the shelf to the deep ocean and across the equatorial currents. From boreal late autumn to early spring, four to 18 cyclonic or anticyclonic eddies are formed off the coastal region between southern Mexico and Panama. The anticyclonic gyres, which tend to be larger and last longer than the cyclonic ones, are the best studied: they typically are similar to 180-500 km in diameter, depress the pycnocline from similar to 60 to 145 m at the eddy center, have swirl speeds in excess of 1 m s(-1), migrate west at velocities ranging from 11 to 19 cm s(-1) (with a slight southward component), and maintain a height signature of up to 30 cm. The primary generating agents for these eddies are the strong, intermittent wind jets that blow across the isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico, the lake district in Nicaragua and Costa Rica, and the Panama canal. Other proposed eddy-generating mechanisms are the conservation of vorticity as the North Equatorial Counter Current (NECC) turns north on reaching America, and the instability of coastally trapped waves/currents. Tropical Instability Waves (TIWs) are perturbations in the SST fronts on either side of the equatorial cold tongue. They produce SST variations on the order of 1-2 degrees C, have periods of 20-40 days, wavelengths of 1000-2000 km, phase speeds of around 0.5 m s(-1) and propagate westward both north and south of the Equator. The Tropical Instability Vortices (TIVs) are a train of westward-propagating anticyclonic eddies associated with the TIWs. They exhibit eddy currents exceeding 1.3 m s(-1), a westward phase propagation speed between 30 and 40 km d(-1), a signature above the pycnocline, and eastward energy propagation. Like the TIWs, they result from the latitudinal barotropically unstable shear between the South Equatorial Current (SEC) and the NECC with a potential secondary source of energy from baroclinic instability of the vertical shear with the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC). This review of mesoscale processes is part of a comprehensive review of the oceanography of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Cao, ZH; Xu, Q; Zhang, DL				Cao, Zuohao; Xu, Qin; Zhang, Da-Lin			Impact of Cyclone-Cyclone Interaction on Lake-Effect Snowbands: A False Alarm	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												In this study, the impacts of two cyclone interactions with the environmental flow and with each other on a heavy winter snowfall event over the Great Lakes region are examined by applying a recently-developed diagnostic tool to a lake-effect snowstorm. This winter snowfall event was a false alarm by the Canadian operational model, in which the predicted lake-effect snowfall at the lee side of Lake Erie doubles the observed. The false alarm involves the interactions of two cyclones, whose relative locations are poorly predicted, leading to inaccurate prediction of their induced winds and interactions over Lake Erie at both low and upper levels. In particular, at 1,000 hPa, the cyclone-induced winds and their interactions over Lake Erie caused colder and drier air over warm-moist open-water lake surface that is favorable for more latent heat flux deriving from the lake in the model than in the real atmosphere. At 500 hPa, the location errors of the model predicted cyclones reversed the cyclone-induced winds over Lake Erie from mainly southerly to northerly, especially during the intense snowfall period. An analysis of the conditional symmetric instability (CSI) index over Lake Erie reveals that the operational model systematically over-predicts CSI, more significantly during the intense snowfall period. As a result, the operational model prediction makes a false alarm of a lake-effect snowfall event with large errors in precipitation intensity. Future improvements in operational model predictions are also suggested.

An analysis of the conditional symmetric instability (CSI) index over Lake Erie reveals that the operational model systematically over-predicts CSI, more significantly during the intense snowfall period. Because of the above reasons, the false alarm of lake-effect snowfall results.

In this study, a pollen record covering the last deglaciation and Holocene from Lake Tangra Yumco on the central TP is presented. A regional vegetation and climate history on the TP during the late glacial period is inferred, corresponding to long-term variations in the atmospheric circulation systems. Prior to 16,100 cal a BP, most areas of the TP are covered by treeless vegetation, mostly affected by the Westerlies. After that three major vegetation shifts to more humid-preferring vegetation types on the TP are detected during 16,100-14,600, 13,600-13,000, 12,400-10,400 cal a BP. These shifts should indicate three rapid intensifications in the ISM. During the Holocene (11400-3000 cal a BP), alpine steppe persists in the Tangra Yumco basin. Moistest conditions with strongest ISM occur prior to 8600 cal a BP. After 8600 cal a BP, climate is probably drier with a weakened ISM. Moreover, drought events at 9600-9300, 8200-7400, 5500, 4700-3700, 3200 cal a BP indicate the weakening events of ISM. Vegetation and climate changes on the central TP are mainly insolation driven, but are also associated with the influence of Holocene abrupt cold events in the North Atlantic region.

Previous studies have mainly focused on decadal lake changes, yet their rapid evolutions at short temporal intervals and the associated atmospheric origins remain elusive. Here, we produce a new lake area change dataset at monthly sampling over 2015-2020 from 16,801 satellite images. Our estimates achieve an accuracy of <30 m, as evidenced by in-situ GPS field survey validations of representative lake shorelines. We found contrasting patterns in recent rapid area changes: deaccelerating in the north and accelerating in the south. Such contrasting pattern was unprecedented in the last two decades and is likely caused by recent precipitation anomalies, indicating that lakes in TP may experience a tipping point. Lakes are found to store only a small portion (<5 %) of net precipitation in summer, increased to-11 % for years with heavy precipitation, which helps understand the water mass budget for lakes over there. Our study highlights the importance of investigating short-term lake area changes as a climate proxy to study their rapid responses to intra-and inter-annual climate variability.

Dynamics of the West African monsoon under mid-Holocene precessional forcing: Regional climate model simulations	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												The African Humid Period (AHP), about 14 800 yr ago [ 14.8 - 5.5 ka ( ka 1000 yr ago)], was a time of increased humidity over Africa. Paleoclimate evidence suggests that the West African summer monsoon was stronger and more extensive 6 ka than today, and that the Saharan Desert was green. Here, a regional climate model that produces an excellent simulation of today's climate over northern Africa is used to study the dynamics of the monsoon 6 ka. Changes in insolation, atmospheric CO2, and vegetation are used to impose 6-ka conditions, and the role of each forcing is isolated. Vegetation is not interactive, and the large-scale circulation and SSTs are fixed at present-day values for the 6-ka simulations. The regional model produces precipitation increases across the Sahel and Sahara that are in good agreement with the paleodata. However, unobserved drying is simulated over the Guinean coast region where paleodata are sparse. Precipitation increases in the Sahel are related to a northward shift of the monsoon, the elimination of the African easterly jet, and an intensification and deepening of the low-level westerly jet on the west coast. The thermal low - Saharan high system of the present-day climate is replaced by a deep thermal low. When this system becomes fully developed in midsummer, cyclonic circulations transport moisture north into the Sahara, and rainfall increases there. Surface temperatures decrease despite the increased solar forcing 6 ka because of an increase in cloudiness. A moist static energy budget analysis shows that increased low-level moisture dominates the cooling to destabilize the vertical column and enhance convection. Even though solar forcing is the ultimate cause of the AHP, the model responds more strongly to the vegetation forcing, especially early in the summer season, emphasizing the importance of vegetation in maintaining the intensified monsoon system.					; Patricola, Christina/L-9902-2016; Cook, Kerry/B-4998-2011	Cook, Kerry/0000-0001-9270-4395; Patricola, Christina/0000-0002-3387-0307; 													0894-8755	1520-0442				FEB	2007	20	4					694	716		10.1175/JCLI4013.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI4013.1													WOS:000244102100006

Most published lake level histories of Qinghai Lake are interpreted from drill-core proxies. Here we combine geomorphic shoreline investigations with optically stimulated luminescence dating to constrain lake level variations since the last deglacial. The results indicate that two periods of highstands occurred during the last deglacial (approximate to 16-14.9 and approximate to 12.6-12.2 ka), and that lake levels were 6-7.4m higher than at present. Lake levels dropped abruptly during the Younger Dryas, and were generally low with frequent fluctuations during the early Holocene. Qinghai Lake reached its highest Holocene level, 9.1m higher than modern, at approximate to 5 ka, and has regressed during the past 2 ka. We propose that high lake levels during the last deglacial were due mainly to melting glacial and permafrost waters, supplemented by enhanced Westerlies precipitation and decreased evaporation during Heinrich Event 1 (approximate to 16-14.9 ka) and increased ASM rainfall during the BOlling-Allerod warm period (approximate to 14-12 ka). Lake level fluctuations during the Holocene were generally in accordance with moisture variations in the marginal monsoon zones of inland China.

It is located next to a freshwater source, Lake Michigan, and surrounded by productive agricultural land and diverse natural habitats. This study explores the sensitivity of mesoscale urban heat island (UHI) simulations to urban parameterizations, focusing on the Chicago metropolitan area (CMA) and its environs. For this purpose, a series of climate downscaling experiments using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at 1 km horizontal resolution. A typical summer hot day in Chicago was considered, which is imitative of a summer day in the late 21st century. This study utilizes National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2006 classifications to test UHI sensitivity for CMA. Among different urban parameterization schemes, BEP+BEM best reproduces the urban surface temperatures in comparison to other urban schemes. Results show that UHI is more pronounced with BEP and BEP+BEM schemes due to explicit accounting of anthropogenic heat (AH). The study also investigates the effects of urbanization on regional climate by replacing Chicago metropolitan area by agricultural landscape, which yielded increased surface wind speeds due to reduced mechanical and thermal resistance.

Results show that the lake surface temperature (LST) biases produced by BCC_AVIM2.0 with the default lake scheme can be largely reduced by adopting the CoLM-Lake scheme in winter due to much more realistically simulated vertical water temperature profiles over the Great Lakes region. The spatial distributions and seasonal variations of the LST simulations can also be significantly improved by the CoLM-Lake scheme within BCC_AVIM2.0. The performances of BCC_AVIM2.0 in simulating the lake ice in winter can be largely improved by replacing the default lake scheme with the CoLM-Lake scheme. The improvements in the LST simulated by BCC_AVIM2.0 with the CoLM-Lake scheme further lead to reduced biases in the simulated ground surface temperature. The simulations of air temperature and precipitation in the coupled model are also improved by adopting the CoLM-Lake scheme over the Great Lakes region, which indicates the improvements in simulating the energy and water exchange between the atmosphere and lakes. This study highlights the importance of a more realistic lake scheme in simulating the ground surface temperature and the energy exchanges between the atmosphere and lakes.					黄, 安宁/K-7473-2019; ling, xiaolu/E-2764-2013; dai, yongjiu/D-6261-2014; Fu, Zhipeng/JPL-5535-2023; Dai, Yongjiu/D-6261-2014; LI, WEI/ISS-1208-2023; Huang, Anning/K-7473-2019; Guo, WD/G-4592-2010	Guo, Weidong/0000-0003-0299-6393; dai, yongjiu/0000-0002-3588-6644; Wei, Nan/0000-0002-0494-0038; Huang, Anning/0000-0001-9872-440X; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				MAY 16	2020	125	9							e2019JD031272	10.1029/2019JD031272	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JD031272													WOS:000536605500009
J	Leroy, SAG				Leroy, Suzanne A. G.			Vegetation cycles in a disturbed sequence around the Cobb-Mountain subchron in Catalonia (Spain)	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												A 52-m-long lacustrine sequence was recovered from the basin of Bobila-Ordis, near Banyoles (N-E Spain). The presence of Early Biharian rodent teeth (Early Pleistocene) and of a c. 9-ka-long palaeomagnetic reversal (Cobb-Mountain subchron) suggests an age centred on 1.2 Ma, making this sequence one of the very few well-dated terrestrial sequences of that age in Europe. The first 22.5 m (with an interglacial character) are very homogenous owing to sedimentation affected by underwater springs. In the middle part of the sequence, palynological analyses, supported by sediment visual description, ostracod and mollusc assemblages, allow the reconstruction of one glacial-interglacial cycle, with vegetation succession. A second incomplete climatic cycle is recorded in the top part, within a shallower lake. These brief interruptions in the two climatic cycles are possibly linked to lake bank collapse caused by Hippopotamus amphibius or faulting linked to karst. The succession is likely to correlate to MIS 36-33. The Bobila-Ordis lacustrine series (including two other nested lakes) covers altogether some sections of four glacial and four interglacial periods, not all contiguous.

C-14 AMS dating brackets the age of paleosols between 40 and 19.6 ka and suggests loess to be > 40 ka. Our study shows that a cold/dry climate prevailed at >40 ka (Late Pleistocene), during which the loess accumulation took place, and a warm/humid climate after that led to the development of soil units, with a prominent warm/humid phase around 35 ka. The range of Chemical Index of Alteration (72-78) and significant amounts of illite and chlorite in the section indicate moderate weathering. High kaolinite content, low chlorite, increased K/C, I/C, K/ (I + C) ratio, and presence of poorly crystalline and Al-rich illite by similar to 36 ka indicates increasing weathering intensity, likely due to an enhanced Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). High magnetic susceptibility during 35-32 ka indicates enhanced pedogenesis due to a warm-humid climate. Paleotemperature estimates reveal a relatively warmer (by similar to 7 degrees C) climate during pedogenesis than that at >40 ka. delta C-13(SOM) values (-17 parts per thousand to -22.2 parts per thousand) suggest C-3 plants dominated the Kashmir Valley through the Late Pleistocene, however, a short period of enhanced summer monsoon at similar to 35 ka favored C-4 plant growth. The paleoclimate variability in the loess-paleosol sequence presented here agrees with the Guliya Ice Core delta O-18 record and high lake water levels in the Tibetan Plateau.

However, these emissions are poorly constrained at the regional (10(2)-10(6)km(2)) and seasonal scales. Here we use a combination of tall tower CO2 mixing ratio and carbon isotope ratio observations and inverse modeling techniques to constrain anthropogenic CO2 emissions within a highly heterogeneous agricultural landscape near Saint Paul, Minnesota, in the Upper Midwestern United States. The analyses indicate that anthropogenic emissions contributed 6.6, 6.8, and 7.4mol/mol annual CO2 enhancements (i.e., departures from the background values) in 2008, 2009, and 2010, respectively. Oil refinery, the energy industry (power and heat generation), and residential emissions (home heating and cooking) contributed 2.9 (42.5%), 1.4 (19.8%), and 1.1mol/mol (15.8%) of the total anthropogenic enhancement over the 3-year period according to a priori inventories. The total anthropogenic signal was further partitioned into CO2 emissions derived from fuel oil, natural gas, coal, gasoline, and diesel consumption using inverse modeling and carbon isotope ratio analyses. The results indicate that fuel oil and natural gas consumption accounted for 52.5% of the anthropogenic CO2 sources in winter. Here the a posteriori CO2 emission from natural gas was 79.04.1% (a priori 20.0%) and accounted for 63% of the total CO2 enhancement including both biological and anthropogenic sources. The a posteriori CO2 emission from fuel oil was 8.43.8% (a priori 32.5%)suggesting a more important role of residential heating in winter. The modeled carbon isotope ratio of the CO2 source (delta C-13(s), -29.3 +/- 0.4%) was relatively more enriched in C-13-CO2 compared to that derived from Miller-Tans plot analyses (-35.5 parts per thousand to -34.8 parts per thousand), supporting that natural gas consumption was underestimated for this region.					xiao, ke/HSB-5863-2023; Millet, Dylan/G-5832-2012; Griffis, Timothy/A-5707-2011; Chen, Zichong/MBV-3571-2025	Griffis, Timothy/0000-0002-2111-5144; Baker, John/0000-0002-7937-9839													2169-897X	2169-8996				MAY 16	2018	123	9					4674	4694		10.1029/2017JD027881	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2017JD027881													WOS:000434132400017
J	Neil, K; Lacourse, T				Neil, Karen; Lacourse, Terri			Diatom responses to long-term climate and sea-level rise at a low-elevation lake in coastal British Columbia, Canada	ECOSPHERE												Diatom assemblages from Lake Stowell, a low-elevation lake in coastal British Columbia, were used to assess limnological responses associated with changes in relative sea level (RSL) and climate over the past 14,500 yr. Marine diatom taxa dominated the early record and disappeared abruptly by 14,000 cal yr BP in response to glacio-isostatic uplift and an ensuing decrease in RSL. A brackish-freshwater phase from 14,200 to 13,400 cal yr BP was marked by increases in several diatom taxa with tolerance for low-to-moderate salinity, after which assemblages became strictly freshwater. Biostratigraphic changes in both diatom and chironomid assemblages from Lake Stowell occurred more or less simultaneously throughout the record in response to long-term changes in climate forcings, such as temperature. Increases in cold-adapted diatom (Staurosirella pinnata, Staurosira construens, Staurosirella dubia) and chironomid (Sergentia) taxa between 12,900 and 11,700 cal yr BP coincided with Younger Dryas cooling, suggesting a direct link with summer temperature. Shifts in aquatic biota also reflected indirect mechanisms through which climate affected the Lake Stowell ecosystem, for example, by altering thermal stratification, disturbance regimes, and nutrient concentrations. For instance, high summer insolation and warm summer temperatures from 11,700 to 8500 cal yr BP were associated with greater abundances of Stephanodiscus hantzschii and especially Aulacoseira subarctica. A concurrent opening of the forest canopy triggered by warming would have exposed the lake to strong winds and enhanced mixing, favoring these more heavily silicified taxa as an indirect consequence of climatic changes. Diatom assemblages appear to have been impacted by the deposition of Mount Mazama tephra at 7600 cal yr BP; a notable increase in Aulacoseira tenella suggests a response to increased silica availability in association with tephra deposition.					; Lacourse, Terri/G-5647-2012	Lacourse, Terri/0000-0002-7559-5374; 													2150-8925					SEP	2019	10	9							e02868	10.1002/ecs2.2868	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2868													WOS:000490766500025

Flood routings from the Mojave River headwaters to its terminal playa. and water balance calculations for the resulting lakes. indicate that floods comparable in magnitude to the largest floods in the modern record must occur almost annually to generate and maintain perennial lakes. In contrast, the modern floods of this magnitude have recurrence intervals greater than 18 years. Such an increase in flood frequency is required even if lake evaporation is reduced by as much as 50%. Modern extreme floods of the Mojave River are related to meridional atmospheric circulation and a southeastward shift in the winter low pressure center over the North Pacific Ocean. causing vigorous storms over the headwaters in the San Bernardino Mountains of southern California. This winter pattern probably occurred more frequently to induce the large number of storms and floods needed to form the middle and late Holocene lakes in Silver Lake playa.

J	Tonetta, D; Staehr, PA; Schmitt, R; Petrucio, MM				Tonetta, Denise; Staehr, Peter Anton; Schmitt, Rafael; Petrucio, Mauricio Mello			Physical conditions driving the spatial and temporal variability in aquatic metabolism of a subtropical coastal lake	LIMNOLOGICA												We investigated the importance of meteorological and lake physical conditions for temporal, horizontal and vertical differences in the concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) and water temperature, and the derived daily estimates of gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R) and net ecosystem production (NEP). Our study was conducted in a subtropical and polymictic lake in Southern Brazil, during a spring-summer transition. Metabolic rates were determined from two sites using the open water oxygen technique. At the central deep site, oxygen sondes were deployed at three depths to assess patterns in vertical variability. During 10 days, an additional DO and temperature sonde was placed near the shoreline allowing us to compare metabolic differences in the surface layers between the central pelagic and littoral site, While GPP was similar, R was significantly higher at the shallower littoral site, causing NEP to be lower, although NEP was still positive. The littoral site had less diel changes in DO and higher daily variability in all metabolic rates. Variability in GPP and R at the littoral site was related to temperature, wind speed and rainfall suggesting that short-term variability in metabolic rates in shallow areas are sensitive to resuspension of sediments caused by a less stable water column. A clear vertical gradient was furthermore found for the metabolic rates at the central deep part of the lake, related to the light extinction, with highest GPP around 0.3 m and decreasing with depth, while respiration showed the inverse pattern. Below subsurface, respiration prevailed at 5.0 m depth and was uncoupled to primary production. Under conditions with high light and temperature, and low wind speeds, the mixing depth became shallower, in turn increasing the water column stability at the deep pelagic site, which resulted in higher mean light available and higher GPP in the water column. Our results confirm that deployment of sensors in different sites and depths allows for spatially, as well as temporally more representative estimates of lake metabolism. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Mitigation of lampricide toxicity to juvenile lake sturgeon: the importance of water alkalinity and life stage	CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY												The pesticide, 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM), is used to control invasive sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) populations in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Applied to infested tributaries, it is most toxic to larval sea lamprey, which have a low capacity to detoxify TFM. However, TFM can be toxic to lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), whose populations are at risk throughout the basin. They are most vulnerable to TFM in early life stages, with the greatest risk of non-target mortality occurring in waters with high alkalinity. We quantified TFM toxicity and used radio-labelled TFM (C-14-TFM) to measure TFM uptake rates in lake sturgeon in waters of different pH and alkalinity. Regardless of pH or alkalinity, TFM uptake was 2-3-fold higher in young-of-the-year (YOY) than in age 1-year-plus (1+) sturgeon, likely due to higher mass-specific metabolic rates in the smaller YOY fish. As expected, TFM uptake was highest at lower (pH 6.5) versus higher (pH 9.0) pH, indicating that it is taken up across the gills by diffusion in its unionized form. Uptake decreased as alkalinity increased from low (similar to 50 mg L-1 as CaCO3) to moderate alkalinity (similar to 150 mg L-1 as CaCO3), before plateauing at high alkalinity (similar to 250 mg L-1 as CaCO3). Toxicity curves revealed that the 12-h LC50 and 12-h LC99.9 of TFMto lake sturgeon were in fact higher (less toxic) than in sea lamprey, regardless of alkalinity. However, in actual treatments, 1.3-1.5 times the minimum lethal TFM concentration (MLC = LC99.9) to lamprey is applied to maximize mortality, disproportionately amplifying TFM toxicity to sturgeon at higher alkalinities. We conclude that limiting TFM treatments to late summer/early fall in waters of moderate-high alkalinity, when lake sturgeon are larger with lower rates of TFM uptake, would mitigate non-target TFM effects and help conserve populations of these ancient, culturally important fishes.

J	Jones, B; Renaut, RW; Konhauser, KO				Jones, B; Renaut, RW; Konhauser, KO			Genesis of large siliceous stromatolites at Frying Pan Lake, Waimangu geothermal field, North Island, New Zealand	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Lilypad stromatolites, up to 3 m long and 1.5 m wide, were found to be actively growing in the shallow marginal waters of Frying Pan Lake and its outflow channel. These stromatolites, composed of Phormidium (> 90%), Fischerella, and a variety of other microbes, develop through a series of distinct growth stages. Dark green microbial mats cover the floor of the outflow channel and give rise to columns of various sizes and shapes in the shallower marginal waters. Once the columns reach the water level, the mats spread laterally to form a lilypad stromatolite. The lilypads are characterized by a raised, dark green rim, 4-5 mm high, that encircles a flat interior covered with a distinctive orange-red mat. The microbes forming the columns and lilypad plate are being actively silicified. The stromatolites are formed of: (i) flat-lying Phormidium filaments (P-laminae), (ii) upright filaments of Phormidium that are commonly associated with Fischerella (U-laminae), and (iii) mucus, diatoms and pyrite framboids (M-laminae). P-laminae dominate most of the columns, with tripartite cycles of P-, U-, to M-laminae being found mostly in the upper parts of the stromatolites. The transition from the P- to U-laminae is marked by a change in the growth pattern of the Phormidium and branching of Fischerella, which was probably triggered by a change in environmental conditions. In the Frying Pan Lake outflow channel, this change may be related to fluctuations in water level and flow rates that are caused by periods of heavy rain, seasonal changes, long-term variations in rainfall, and/or the unique 40-day hydrological cycle that exists between Frying Pan Lake and Inferno Crater, which is a nearby hydrothermal crater lake.

However, the source of magnetic minerals in the surface sediments of this lake is unknown, still needing further exploration. Due to simple hydrological systems, the Hugunagyan Lake provides a unique record for investigating the magnetic property of sediments and surface processes. In this study, based on the magnetic properties of 43 surface sediment, 12 surface soil, and 7 volcanic rock samples from the catchment, we demonstrate that the magnetic minerals in sediments were dominated by fine super paramagnetic magnetic particles, with coexistence of pseudo-single-domain states minerals. There are no signatures showing the presence of biogenic and authigenic magnetite. The magnetic properties of surface sediments display significant differences between the potential sources of aeolian dust from the loess in North China and modern surface soils in Central Asia, suggesting that the magnetic minerals mainly originate from the weathered materials in the catchment, and there are no further signals of winter monsoon-driven aeolian dust input.					shang, shang/IYS-8177-2023; Wei, Zhiqiang/KDN-1700-2024; 陈, 元翰/JXN-0032-2024; tang, xiaowen/KIE-6786-2024														1569-4445	1873-0604				DEC	2021	19	6					661	676		10.1002/nsg.12175	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nsg.12175		SEP 2021											WOS:000695123200001

Results indicate that changes in climatic conditions had a significant effect on Hg concentrations (Hg-C) and accumulation rates (Hg-AR). Multi-proxy records including dry density, grain size, geochemical elements, organic matter and pollen indicators were compared with Hg accumulation. The results revealed that the contributions of detrital input and atmospheric deposition were minor, and Hg accumulation in the sediments was closely related to changes in climatic conditions: relatively drier and colder climate would result in shrinkage of the lake water body thus favoring increased formation of organic-rich peat or gyttja and leading to enhanced absorption of Hg by organic matter and result in increases of Hg-C and HgAR in sediments, and vice versa. Our results indicate that variations of Hg accumulation in Dahu Swamp were greatly impacted by climate under the influences of solar insolation changes and shrinkage or expansion of ice sheets in high latitudes to the north. The results of this study provide an insight into the response of Hg accumulation to low latitude climate processes in the East Asian summer monsoon region.

Because of this recent input, DDT residues concentrations rose more quickly in zooplankton than in fish during 2009. In autumn 2010 the ratio drastically dropped to one-two for all the compounds indicating that the glacial DDT load should have been ceased. The situation was different for PCBs that were released to a much lower extent from glaciers. The PCB 138 ratio between zooplankton and fish was always around one-two in both years. As the zooplankton response to pollution changes resulted particularly prompt, our research highlights the importance of this component as an early warning bioindicator of hydrophobic pollutants.					; Quadroni, Silvia/T-1972-2019; Bettinetti, Roberta/AAD-7072-2019	Bettinetti, Roberta/0000-0001-7481-6190; Quadroni, Silvia/0000-0003-1295-2108; LEONI, BARBARA/0000-0001-9448-9457; 													1129-5767						2012	71	2					335	339		10.4081/jlimnol.2012.e36	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2012.e36													WOS:000313475300011

Estimation of ground-water exchange with semi-arid playa lakes (Antequera region, southern Spain)	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Playa lakes occur in and and semi-arid climates and have a significant economic, ecological and cultural value. They are particularly vulnerable to changing hydrologic regimes due to climate change or human activities. We determined the hydrological regime of 10 playa lakes in southern Spain based on water budgets for a 5-year period (1997 2001). Surface runoff was measured in the watersheds, precipitation and evaporation/evapo-transpiration estimated using local meteorological data and ground-water flows assessed using a network of wells and piezometers. The examination of seasonal variations in the lakes' water levels and the water budgets indicated that ground-water discharge plays a key role in the hydrological dynamics and the maintenance of the playa ecosystems. Major inorganic ions and stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in lake water, ground-water and springs were measured. Water samples from the lakes and ground-water were a mixture of cations -SO42-. and -Cl- type due to the aridity of the climate and lithologies of the basin. The high TDS (63.4 g/l) content of some ground-water samples indicates regional geologic control on water quality and the dissolution of gypsum and halite. Stable oxygen isotope ratios for lake water (-3.6 to 9.8 parts per thousand delta O-18(SMOW)) were different from those of ground-water and springs (-6.8 to 1.1 parts per thousand delta O-18(SMOW)) suggesting different evolutional patterns. The results of this study provides evidence that the combination of water budgets, hydrochemistry and stable isotope hydrology can lead to a better understanding of wet playa's hydrology. This approach could, thus, prove helpful to establish hydrological regimes in this type of semi-arid environments. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we explore the relative importance of this directional spatial effect. Specifically, we construct a wind connec-tivity diagram for modern pollen sample sites according to the prevailing monsoon direction, and extract latent spatial variables representing the directional process of the ASM, using the method of asymmetric eigenvector maps. We fit redundancy analysis models using both spatial variables and local climate factors, and conduct variation partitioning to quantify the effect of directional spatial effect by the ASM. Taking into account the joint effect with local climate, the directional spatial process induced by the ASM significantly explains the variation of pollen assemblages on the TP. The effect is detected in pollen groups with contrasting functional types and dispersal modes; for example, the composition of arboreal pollen and non-arboreal pollen are both significantly affected by the ASM, yet best explained by models assuming different monsoon directions. Anemophilous pollen shows a higher percentage of variation explained by the ASM than non-anemophilous pollen. Our results indicate that directional processes induced by the monsoon is an important influence on pollen assemblages in the TP and support the idea that deposition patterns of pollen, especially arboreal pollen is a useful proxy for studying monsoon evolution. A similar approach can also be applied to paleomonsoon simulations using fossil pollen records. The role of directional dispersal in affecting fossil pollen composition and abundance by prevailing winds deserves further investigation when undertaking Quaternary paleoenvironmental reconstructions using pollen.

These deposits include well-sorted aeolian sand, paleosols and/or loess. Aeolian sand represents dune-field expansion and/or dune buildup, whereas paleosols indicate stabilization of dunes, accompanying ameliorated vegetation cover. On the basis of 25 dates by optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), it appears that aeolian activities occurred episodically at 33.5, 20.3, 13.9, 11.8-11.0, 9.4, 7.8, and 5.7 (5.5) ka, which is largely consistent with the recent findings from the adjacent semi-arid areas. Aeolian sand mobility occurring during the early to mid Holocene conflicts with a climatic optimum inferred from lacustrine records in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. This inconsistency may be resolved by interpreting aeolian activity as a response to decreased effective moisture due to enhanced evaporation, induced by higher summer insolation at that time, together with local terrain and its effects on moisture. Our results suggest that aeolian sand and paleosol cannot be simply ascribed to regional dry and wet climates, respectively, and they most likely reflect changes in effective moisture.

We have studied the variation of rainy-season (April-September) precipitation in eastern China during 1961-2016. Overall, we found that rainy-season precipitation increased in the south and decreased in the north during 1992-2016 (PII) compared to 1961-1991 (PI). By defining rainfall-belt indices of intensity and central location, we found that the southern rainfall-belt during the main rainy-season tends to produce much more-intense precipitation during PI relative to PII, in contrast to the northern rainfall-belt, which tends to have less-intense precipitation during PII. Despite some fluctuations, the central positions of neither the northern nor the southern rainfall-belts exhibit a statistically significant difference between the two periods. Unlike during PI, during PII, there is an obvious anticyclone over the Lake Baikal region. This anticyclone has caused anomalous north winds flowing from north-central to southwestern China, leading to weakening of the northward moisture transport. Also, regions such as northeastern, north-central, and southwestern China have been controlled by negative geopotential height anomalies and weak vertical air-motion anomalies, resulting in drying from north to southwestern China. At the same time, the enhanced water-vapour convergence in the southeastern coastal region of China favours increased precipitation there. These processes working in concert created the drying-north-wetting-south pattern in the main rainy-season during 1961-2016. The change in rainfall-belt intensity in eastern China has also shown a close relationship with the change in vapour transport from low latitudes. The weakened land-sea thermal difference in the East Asia-Northwest Pacific region, which has weakened water-vapour and atmospheric circulation, has also played a role in the change of rainfall-belt intensity.

J	Iqbal, MZ				Iqbal, M. Z.			Short-term variability in isotopic composition of precipitation: A case study from the Midwestern United States	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Oxygen and deuterium isotopes in precipitation were analysed to define local isotopic trends in Iowa, US. The area is far inland from an oceanic source and the observed averages of delta(18)O and delta D are -6.43 parts per thousand and -41.35 parts per thousand for Ames. -7.53 parts per thousand and -51.33 parts per thousand for Cedar Falls, and -6.01 parts per thousand and -38.19 parts per thousand fir Iowa City, respectively. Although these data generally follow global trends, they are different when compared to a semi-arid mid-continental location in North Platt, Nebraska. The local meteoric water lines of Iowa are delta D = 7.68 delta(18)O + 8.0 for Ames, delta D = 7.62 delta(18)O + 6.07 for Cedar Falls, and delta D = 7.78 delta(18)O + 8.61 for Iowa City. The current Iowa study compares well with a study conducted in Ames, Iowa. 10 yeats earlier. The difference between Iowas and Nebrasks studies are attributed to a variable climate across the northern Great Plains ranging from sub-humid to humid climate fed by the the tropical air stream from the Gulf of Mexico. The average d-excess values are 10.06 parts per thousand for Ames, 8.92 parts per thousand for Cedar Falls and 9.90 parts per thousand for Iowas City. Eighty seven percent of the samples are within the global d-excess range of 0 parts per thousand and 20%. The results are similar to previous studies, including those by National Atmospheric Deposition Programs and International Atomic Energy Agency. It appears that the impct of recycled water or secondary evaporation delta(18)O values of area precipitation is minimal.

Phytoplankton appeared to aggregate at daytime while be uniformly distributed at nighttime in the monitoring period, based on Morisita's index (MI) and the mean residence depth (MRD). Statistical analysis showed phytoplankton performed Diel vertical migration on July 1 and 2-3, but not on July 7. The results showed that solar irradiance was significantly correlated with MI and MRD (R-2>0.6, p<0.001) while relative water column stability accounted for more variations of both parameters (R-2>0.7, p<0.001). It indicated that solar irradiance and relative water column stability greatly affected vertical distribution patterns of phytoplankton in the Microcystis bloom period of Xiangxi Bay.

Cercarial dermatitis of bathers in northern Argentine Patagonia	MEDICINA-BUENOS AIRES												The cercarial dermatitis is a zoonotic, summer, skin-disease, caused by a swimming larva (cercaria) of a schistosomatid trematode. This larva accidentally penetrates the skin of people in the water, causing an allergic reaction, which is not always reported in health centers, so it is difficult to determine its incidence. Cases have been registered worldwide, including Argentina, although the epidemiological studies were performed only in the Northern Hemisphere.

The risk factors were analyzed and grouped in "personal characteristics", "use of the recreational resource", and "prevention measures". At the Pellegrini Lake, the people's sensitivity included in "personal characteristics" was the only determining factor for the occurrence of this zoonosis, mean while in Mari Menuco Lake, the bathing time and distance from the coast, and the use of lotions would affect the occurrence of swimmer's itch.

A comparison of results from two summers before treatment and three summers after treatment indicates that migration of cyanobacteria was unaffected. Migration of Gloeotrichia echinulata continued to be highly variable from year-to-year which made isolation of the effects of treatment difficult. Migration of other species of cyanobacteria, particularly Coelosphaerium naegelianum, increased after treatment. The colonial phosphorus content of migrating G. echinulata was also unaffected by the treatment, indicating that alum did not interfere with phosphorus uptake from the sediments. Experimental results revealed that illumination at the sediment surface did not regulate migration of cyanobacteria under the study conditions. Although alum treatment did not affect the migration of cynobacteria, sediment phosphorus release in anoxic cores was reduced to one-third of the pre-treatment rate.																			0003-9136					SEP	1997	140	3					373	392																WOS:A1997YG77000006

It constitutes about 60 to 70% of waterfowl inhabiting this area. Average nesting density in preferable habitats was estimated as 2 pairs per 1 sq. km. The total number estimated for Markov's Depression was about 12 000 pairs and more. Vigeon inhabits rivers rather than lakes. Vigeons' nourishment consists mostly of horsetails. These ducks are ecologically plastic choosing the nesting sites. The choice depends on current seasonal state of flood regime. The terms of the initiation of nesting are not early and can be stretched. The influence of unfavourable meteorological conditions on the breeding success in insignificant, while the influence of carnivorous mammals and birds eliminates about 60% of youngs. Thus, less than three young birds per one breeding female survive by the time of autumn departure. Such mortality is common to vigeon populations in the middle Anadyr floodplain.

The peak inflow to Lake Powell of 111,500 ft(3)/s (3,158 m(3)/s) occurred on June 29th and required operation of both spillways in addition to the powerhouse and outlet works for two months with a maximum release of 92,600 ft3/s (2,623 m3/s) to the Colorado River below Glen Canyon Dam. A large aeration slot was designed, laboratory tested, and installed in the tunnel spillways before the 1984 runoff season. At the time of the high releases, three fearless river guides illegally launched a small dory at Lee's Ferry for an unforgettable adventure to set a new time record for the 277-mile (446 km) journey through the Grand Canyon. The story of the illegal river runners was juxtaposed in time with the Glen Canyon Dam engineers' race to avoid a spillway catastrophe during the 1983 spring runoff. The dam engineers and operators had different opinions of the dam than that of the river guides-they felt the dam was a living monolith, pulsating with energy and dynamism and the river runners felt the dam was an offense against nature. The 1983 flow emergency at Glen Canyon is a story of success by both groups, but only after overcoming huge challenges. The story will be summarized in this paper.																					978-0-7844-8299-5				2020							23	33																WOS:000623522900003

Glacial lakes of the usual types are found in the glaciated southern part of the region. The lakes freeze to a depth of almost 2 m in winter and warm without stratifying to about 13[degree]C in summer. Of the annual heat budget of some 28,000 cal/cm2 only 6000 cal is wind distributed. Total dissolved solids are known to range from 32 to 159 ppm, and the water is of a calcium bicarbonate type except where sea-spray influence is strong. The silica content is very low. A shore community is poorly-developed or absent, apparently because of ice-push, and the standing crop of benthos varies from an indetectable amount to 89.4 kg/ha. Remains of the midge Dryado-tanytarsus are found throughout the sedimentary column of 1 lake, indicating that this genus, which is known only as a late-Pleistocene fossil, lives there today. The sediments of lakes receiving the products of the widespread processes of arctic weathering are very inorganic, with few and poorly-preserved microfossils. Computations based on a radiocarbon-dated pollen chronology suggest a net community productivity averaging less than 2 mg of organic matter/cm2/yr, and Bosmina and tendipedid productivities of less than 10/cm2/yr during the past 6000 years. Further computations involving the data of other authors suggest that of the solar energy fixed by a temperate or arctic lake about one-quarter is preserved in the sediments, one-half is dissipated by the decomposing organisms and one-quarter is dissipated by all the other plants and animals. The arctic environment appears to influence lakes principally through physiographic processes affecting origin, sedimentation, and drainage.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1958	3	2					192	214		10.4319/lo.1958.3.2.0192	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1958.3.2.0192													WOS:A1958WY35900008

Our data indicate that the Dali Lake was significantly diluted to a freshwater lake (0.8 +/- 0.4 g/L) during-11.4-3.8 cal ka BP, relative to the modern brackish state. From the early Holocene (before 8.0 cal ka BP) to the middle Holocene (8.0-5.0 cal ka BP), the average salinity value of Dali Lake decreased by-0.3 g/L (ca. 30%), but our reconstructed temperature record shows an increase of-2.1 degrees C. In the context of climate warming, the evaporation was enhanced, and thus the decline in salinity is attributed to the increased precipitation, indicating a mid-Holocene EASM rainfall maximum. After comparing our reconstruction with vegetation data, we proposed that the stable and abundant EASM rainfall promoted the forest expansion and vegetation recovery over northern China during the mid-Holocene, suggesting the coupling of ecosystems and EASM rainfall in North China.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Song, G; Wang, HL; Shi, LF				Song, Gao; Wang, Hailei; Shi, Linfeng			Climate evolution since 9.32 cal ka BP in Keluke Lake, northeastern Qaidam Basin, China	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Core sediments from Keluke Lake in transitional zone between arid central Asia and monsoon Asia, provide insights into the advance-retreat history of the summer monsoon and the Westerlies. Sediment grain size and delta C-13 of authigenic carbonate reveal paleoclimatic evolution since 9.32 cal ka BP: a dry-cold climate in the early Holocene, a wet-cold climate in the early stage of mid-Holocene, a relatively dry-warm climate in the late stage of mid-Holocene and, a moderately wet and frequently oscillating climate after 2.5 cal ka BP. Keluke Lake was mainly controlled by the Westerlies from 9.32 to 5.8 cal ka BP, and was dominated by the East Asia monsoon during 5.8-2.5 cal ka BP. While in the late Holocene, this area was re-controlled by the Westerlies since 2.5 cal ka BP. The boundary line between the Westerlies controlled arid central Asia and monsoon Asia varied during the Holocene. When the Westerlies strengthened and the East Asian summer monsoon weakened, the boundary line may be pushed southeastward, and vice versa. Generally, the climate in this area showed a wet-cold and dry-warm variation.

Hypolimnetic oxygenation effects on trout condition and growth in North Twin Lake, Washington	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Cross BK, Moore BC, Skinner MM. 2017. Hypolimnetic oxygenation effects on trout condition and growth in North Twin Lake, Washington. Lake Reserve Manage. 33:74-83.Summer stratification can restrict coldwater fish habitat, but we did not observe increases in trout growth or body condition when hypolimnetic oxygenation was applied to improve habitat conditions. Our study investigated the effects of hypolimnetic oxygenation in North Twin Lake (oxygenated 2009-2015 from May through Sep) on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) preferred habitat availability, abundance, body condition, and growth while using adjacent South Twin Lake as an unoxygenated reference. When assessing rainbow trout preferred habitat (dissolved oxygen 5mg/L and temperature 13-19C), oxygen levels were not limiting prior to oxygenation, and oxygenation did not increase preferred habitat availability. Trout abundance in both lakes remained comparable throughout oxygenation, but trout were able to move between lakes outside of summer months. Regardless of oxygenation, North Twin Lake had higher brook trout relative weights (i.e., body condition index) compared to South Twin (P = 0.0002), averaging 89.8 and 86.0, respectively. Rainbow trout relative weight differences were not observed between lakes before or during oxygenation (P = 0.1873). Prior to oxygenation, summer growth rates of rainbow trout were similar between North Twin and South Twin lakes (P = 0.9958). In 2012, growth rates of rainbow trout and brook trout in North Twin were not significantly different from South Twin (P = 0.8210 and P = 0.1474, respectively). Our results suggest that hypoxic conditions were not limiting trout growth or condition in North Twin Lake because preferred habitat volume and prey availability were not enhanced by hypolimnetic oxygenation.

The Ichkeul lake basin is situated in the North of Tunsia. Exposed to domestic sewages along with industrial, municipal, recreational discharges and the old (Pb-Zn) Jalta mine, the lake receives metal concentrations that risk provoking harmful and irreversible disruptions on the fauna and flora. The assessment of trace metals in surface water showed that the maximum values of Fe, Mn, Pb, Zn, Cu and Ni were all below the national and international standard, except for Fe in Hammam Ben Abbes thermal spring and Pb in Wadi Tinja as a result of the solid mining accumulation wastes after the processing of the Pb-Zn and the mineral paragenesis associated with hydrothermal metalliferous conditions of Jebel Ichkeul, added to these the uncontrolled releases of domestic, industrial and agricultural waste water. These factors contribute to the environmentally degradation of the lake water quality.

The release of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from these ponds is often high and significant on the landscape scale. We measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes in a temperate peatland in southern Ontario, Canada, in summer 2014 along a transect from the open water of a small pond (847aEuro-m(2)) towards the surrounding floating mat (5993aEuro-m(2)) and in a peatland reference area. We used a high-frequency closed chamber technique and distinguished between diffusive and ebullitive CH4 fluxes. CH4 fluxes and CH4 bubble frequency increased from a median of 0.14 (0.00 to 0.43)aEuro-mmolaEuro-m(-2)aEuro-h(-1) and 4aEuro-eventsaEuro-m(-2)aEuro-h(-1) on the open water to a median of 0.80 (0.20 to 14.97) mmolaEuro-m(-2)aEuro-h(-1) and 168aEuro-eventsaEuro-m(-2)aEuro-h(-1) on the floating mat. The mat was a summer hot spot of CH4 emissions. Fluxes were 1 order of magnitude higher than at an adjacent peatland site. During daytime the pond was a net source of CO2 equivalents to the atmosphere amounting to 0.13 (-0.02 to 1.06) gaEuro-CO2 equivalents m(-2)aEuro-h(-1), whereas the adjacent peatland site acted as a sink of -0.78 (-1.54 to 0.29) g CO2 equivalents m(-2)aEuro-h(-1). The photosynthetic CO2 uptake on the floating mat did not counterbalance the high CH4 emissions, which turned the floating mat into a strong net source of 0.21 (-0.11 to 2.12) gaEuro-CO2 equivalents m(-2)aEuro-h(-1). This study highlights the large small-scale variability of CH4 fluxes and CH4 bubble frequency at the peatland-pond interface and the importance of the often large ecotone areas surrounding small ponds as a source of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.																			1726-4170	1726-4189					2016	13	12					3777	3791		10.5194/bg-13-3777-2016	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-3777-2016													WOS:000379427700017
J	Cáceres, CE; Tessier, AJ				Cáceres, CE; Tessier, AJ			Incidence of diapause varies among populations of Daphnia pulicaria	OECOLOGIA												Dormancy is a common way in which organisms survive environmental conditions that would be lethal to the active individual. However, while dormant, individuals forgo reproduction. Hence theory suggests an optimal time in which to enter dormancy, depending on risks associated with both remaining active and entering dormancy. When these relative risks differ among habitats, dormancy strategies are predicted to vary as well. For freshwater zooplankton, it has been suggested that sensitivity to the cues that initiate dormancy should be selected against when females have the opportunity to remain in the water column year round. We tested this prediction with 12 populations of lake-dwelling Daphnia pulicaria (Crustacea: Cladocera). Differences among lakes in basin morphometry, predators and resources create a gradient of risk for Daphnia in the water column. Some populations persist in high numbers year round while others are abundant only in spring. We used this difference in persistence ability as an estimate of risk in the water-column. For 3-years of field sampling we found consistent differences among the lake populations in the incidence of dormancy. In some populations, only a small fraction of females switched to producing dormant eggs each year whereas in others the majority of eggs produced in the late spring were dormant. In general, populations that experienced predictably low abundances in the active form exhibited higher incidence of dormancy than did populations that persisted in high abundance year round, but there were exceptions. Our results confirm that the incidence of dormancy varies considerably among populations in a fashion consistent with general theory, but suggest that persistence in the water column is not the sole predictor of the diapause strategy found in any particular lake.																			0029-8549	1432-1939				NOV	2004	141	3					425	431		10.1007/s00442-004-1657-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-004-1657-5								15375690					WOS:000224557300007
J	Chapman, CG; Jones, TA				Chapman, Colin G.; Jones, Tucker A.			First Documented Spawning of White Sturgeon in the Lower Willamette River, Oregon	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												White sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) in the lower Columbia River system were previously known to spawn in only one area; within the 12 km of mainstem Columbia River downstream of Bonneville Dam. Our work provides the first documentation of white sturgeon spawning in the Willamette River, Oregon, a major tributary of the lower Columbia River. We used artificial substrates to sample for white sturgeon eggs downstream of Willamette Falls from 18 May to 20 May 2009 and collected a total of 22 fertilized eggs. Embryonic developmental stages ranged front pigmentation change (Stage 2) to early epithelial (Stage 8), corresponding to fertilization times of approximately 5-17 hours prior to collection. We estimated that spawning occurred between 2100 hours on 19 May and 0900 hours on 20 May 2009, and that a minimum of three independent spawning events took place during that time. Results suggest that the area immediately downstream of Willamette Falls may be important white sturgeon spawning habitat, and that the lower Willamette River is likely an additional source of production for the white sturgeon population in the lower Columbia River system.																			0029-344X					FAL	2010	84	4					327	335		10.3955/046.084.0402	http://dx.doi.org/10.3955/046.084.0402													WOS:000285797800002

However, due to the lack of a well-defined relationship between aeolian deposits and climatic factors in this region, there are few quantitative palaeoclimate reconstructions from these deposits. This deficiency prevents a comprehensive understanding of the precipitation history of the alpine and arid/semi-arid intermontane basins in this region, although the regional landscape is dominated by deserts/dunefields. We studied the relationship between two geochemical indices, C (the ratio of (Fe + Al + Mn + Cr + Co + Ni) to (Ca + Mg + Na + K + Sr + Ba)) and Re (the ratio of (CaO + MgO + K2O + Na2O) to (Fe2O3+MnO2)) of the aeolian topsoils and potential modern climatic variables across the Gonghe Basin in the northeastern QTP. We found that the mean annual precipitation (MAP) is the dominant climatic control of the variations of C and Re in the surface aeolian deposits, accounting for 70.9% and 53.1% of the total explained variances, respectively. Accordingly, we established two climofunctions based on C and Re to quantitatively reconstruct the MAP evolution during the Middle-Late Holocene, from the alternating aeolian sand-palaeosol sequences in the Gonghe Basin. The results revealed five intervals of enhanced MAP, with similar results obtained from the two sections, which document millennial-centennial-scale climatic fluctuations during the Middle-Late Holocene. These fluctuations are consistent with climate records from tree rings and lake sediments in this region, within the dating errors. This consistency supports the reliability of our methodology of quantitative reconstruction based on geochemical climofunctions for aeolian deposits. Our findings demonstrate a robust approach for the quantitative reconstruction of palaeo-precipitation using geochemical parameters from aeolian topsoils in an alpine and arid/semi-arid intermontane basin, and they provide new evidence for understanding significant Holocene environmental events recorded in different geological archives within the transitional region of the monsoon and the westerlies.

J	Park, SJ; Lee, S; Lee, CW				Park, Sung-Jae; Lee, Seulki; Lee, Chang-Wook			Baekdu Volcano Lake "Chun-ji" Ice Dynamic Monitoring Using TerraSAR-X Satellite Imagery	KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The caldera lake "Chun-ji" is located at the summit of Baekdu volcano, which is in the border of China and North Korea. Chun-ji Lake has altitude 2,189 m above sea level. The Chun-ji is freezing in the winter when the water temperature goes down to zero for a year, and it melts in the season when the water temperature goes up again. However, since it is located at a high altitude, there are many cloudy days, and it is difficult to observe with optical images. For this reason, radar images, which are less influenced by weather than optical images, are more effective for observing the ice of heaven and earth. In this study, 75 TerraSAR-X images from chun-ji area were used for analysis from 2015 to 2017, and the calculated ice area and temperature changes were analyzed. As a result, the ice of the caldera lake formed was formed in early December and slowly melted until mid-April. During this period, temperatures in the Samjiyeon area were about -10 degrees C when ice was produced, and the temperature was about 0 degrees C in mid-April when it was thawing. Correlation coefficients between ice surface area and temperature in winter 2015 and 2016, where global ice is produced, show a high correlation of -0.82 and -0.75. In addition to the results of this study, it can be used as an indicator to monitor the volcanic activity by comparing the result of the recent volcanic activity with the result of the increase in water temperature using various imagery.																			1225-6161	2287-9307				APR	2019	35	2					327	336		10.7780/kjrs.2019.35.2.11	http://dx.doi.org/10.7780/kjrs.2019.35.2.11													WOS:000466179900011

In recent years, the anthropogenic impact on the ecosystem of Lake Baikal has been increasing due to the development of industry in the region, the expansion of tourist infrastructure and recreational areas of the coastal zone of the lake. In addition, one of the significant sources of atmospheric pollution in the Baikal region is the emissions of smoke aerosol and trace gases from forest fires, the number of which is increasing in the region.

Competitive ligand equilibration-cathodic stripping voltammetry (CLE-CSV) with APDC( ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate) was used to measure the ligand complexation by Zn2+ and anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) for complexation of Cd2+. In all lakes, the total dissolved cadmium concentration [Cd-T] averaged 0.040 nM ( standard deviation sigma = 0.114), while the average concentration of Cd-binding ligands [L-Cd] was 5.17 +/- 1.79nM (1 sigma), with conditional stability constants relative to free Cd2+, logK '(2+)(/)(Cd)(L), that ranged from 7.92 at depth to 10.58 at the surface. Calculated concentrations of the free aquo ion [Cd2+] averaged 0.0147 +/- 0.0616 nM (1 sigma), and showed a higher percentage of Cd complexed by strong ligands in the summer and in surface waters. The selectivity of cadmium-binding organic ligands was low, and ligand-bound Cd2+ was easily displaced by Zn2+ and Cu2+. Total dissolved zinc concentrations [Zn-T] were highly variable, and ranged from 1.04 to 10.94 nM. The corresponding ligand concentrations of strong zinc-binding ligands [L-Zn] were between 2.14 and 15.52 nM, with conditional stability constants logK '(2+)(/)(Zn)(L) as low as 8.78 in deep water collected in summer from Lake Hauroko, up to a maximum of 12.41 at a depth of 5m in Lake Hayes.

Its purpose was to determine aluminium bioaccumulation in the aquatic environment by testing water, bottom sediments and aquatic plants. Samples were taken in the summers of 2008-2011. pH, electrolytic conductivity and aluminium concentration were determined in water samples, while the sediment and plant samples were submitted to analyses of the aluminium content. The water pH oscillated between 6.04 and 8.95, while the electrolytic conductivity ranged from 440 to 1598 mu S cm(-1). The aluminium concentration in the river water was up to 0.138 mg Al dm(-3) in the Czerwona and up to 0.425 mg Al dm(-3) in the Grabowa. The maximum aluminium content in the bottom sediments was 47.01 mg Al kg(-1) in the Czerwona River and 26.15 mg Al kg(-1) in the Grabowa River. The maximum aluminium content in the aquatic plants sampled from the Czerwona was 91.63 mg Al kg(-1), and from the Grabowa -1,077 mg Al kg(-1). The bioconcentration factor (BCF) of aluminium for the Czerwona River ranged from 5.06 to 24,052, and for the Grabowa River - from 1.10 to 70,132. The concentration factor (CF) of aluminium in the bottom sediments oscillated between 66.72 and 23,492 in the Czerwona River and between 14.81 and 2,763 in the Grabowa. The aluminium content in the two rivers was relatively low in the water, sediments and aquatic plants, which is typical of environments without strong anthropopressure. The values fell within the limits set by environmental water quality standards. The low aluminium accumulation degrees in the biotic and abiotic components indicate that the environments of the two rivers have a low load of aluminium compounds.

The main characteristic separating pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons in Lake Soyang is the dramatic difference in hydrologic inflow. Pre-monsoon C-13-POM (range -32.4 to -21.8 parts per thousand) was lower than post-monsoon C-13-POM (range -25.5 to -19.9 parts per thousand). Epilimnetic C-13-POM was higher post-monsoon compared to pre-monsoon, except in 2007. In the metalimnion, pre-monsoon C-13-POM varied among years, while the variation in C-13-POM post-monsoon was small and was related to the inflow of organic matter during summer monsoon storms. C-13-zooplankton was lower post-monsoon (range -31.9 to -24.4 parts per thousand) compared to pre-monsoon (range -19.4 to -17.7 parts per thousand), while N-15-zooplankton showed the opposite pattern (pre- and post-monsoon average 6.6 +/- 2.0 parts per thousand and 4.3 +/- 1.5 parts per thousand, respectively). In Lake Soyang, the seasonal variation in C-13-zooplankton was closely related to annual succession in the phytoplankton community and C-13-phytoplankton. Thus, the results of this study provide some insights into the use of C-13 and N-15 measurements for understanding linkages between varying hydrologic characteristics and seasonal variation in the stable isotope composition of zooplankton.

FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Salmonids are introduced in various ecosystems, including mountain lakes characterised by extreme environmental constraints. Although these constraints can affect salmonid body condition through direct and indirect pathways, they remain seldom explored despite their importance for understanding salmonid fitness and long-term establishment.In order to fill this gap, we firstly fitted species-specific weight-length relationships for three salmonid species in nine mountain lakes, and compared their allometric coefficients with those of 362 salmonid populations worldwide to identify potential differences in growth trajectory of salmonids in the studied lakes. We then investigated how thermal characteristics and lake morphometry could influence salmonid body conditions, both directly and indirectly through salmonid density, the presence of forage fish and resource densities. We calculated salmonid relative body condition Kn and used a structural equation model (SEM) to disentangle these direct and indirect effects.The values of allometric coefficients for the three species did not differ from those of most salmonids worldwide although ontogenetic changes in Salvelinus alpinus weight gain was observed. Kn differed significantly among the populations studied. The strongest effects were related to direct and indirect effects of lake morphometry, while thermal characteristics had mostly indirect effects on Kn. The strength and the sign of the indirect effects of morphometry and temperature were mediated by the direct effects of resource and salmonid densities on Kn.Kn estimates were greater in lakes with shallow basin slopes than those with steep slopes. Shallow basin slopes probably provide habitats that support high prey availability and require lower energy expenditure by salmonids compared to lakes with steep slopes dominated by pelagic habitats. Complementarily, higher winter and summer temperatures favour Kn by supporting higher prey densities and longer periods of feeding activity. Our results may help managers to select lakes that optimise sustainability of salmonid populations based on the joint effects of basin morphometry and the expected thermal modifications induced by global change.

THE SPRING MIGRATION OF WATERFOWL IN THE RESERVE OLEKMINSKY	NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH												The species composition of waterfowl that pass through Olekminsky Reserve is represented by 24 species; 9 of them are transient birds. Other species are presented as transient as well as nesting. Widespread species are bean goose, whooper swan, mallard, pintail, teal and tufted duck. The uneven distribution of wetlands and their limited variety determine the presence of only two places where there is a pronounced transition and regular stops of migrants. These are the lake-wetland complexes in the Olekma river valley and, to a lesser degree, the head of the Tuolba river. The total number of waterfowl transiting through the territory of the reserve during seasonal migrations has been estimated at 10000-20000 individuals. However, the wetlands nature reserve attracts, as a place of rest and foraging, an average of only 5% of the migrants. Dynamics and time of bird transition were almost the same as in the area of the Lena-Amga interfluve and relevant sections of the river valley Lena. Some differences can be traced in abundance of some species. The span whooper swan, e.g., accounted for up to 4.5-5.5 thousands individuals per season. Long-term dynamics of the migratory population of several species of geese, swans and ducks have opposite tendencies ( the apparent rise, cyclical fluctuations, the decline). However, the total number of waterfowl migrating through the territory of reserve << Olekminsky >> tends to decrease, which can be concluded at the observation data of the spring migration.																			2500-008X						2016	1	2					79	89																WOS:000431418000007

Four short episodes of substantial pH depression occurred at the spawning site. Observed sac fry mortalities (18%) occurred primarily during the longest depression (5 d [days] at pH 4.5-5.0), which coincided with maximum surface runoff and peaks in concentrations (.apprx. 50 .mu.g/l) of inorganic (monomeric) Al. Although most mortalities were coincident with low pH and elevated inorganic Al concentrations, the high survival (82%) demonstrated that under natural conditions most sac fry could tolerate pH < 5.0 and inorganic Al concentrations of 40-50 .mu.g/l for at least 5 d. Substantially higher concentrations of inorganic Al (.apprx. 80 .mu.g/L) were observed in the interstitial waters of the spawning rubble than in ambient waters, which indicated that fry within a spawning substrate may be subjected to more toxic conditions than test fry in incubators above the substrate surface.

We hypothesized that due to differential size-selective predation risk by YOY fish and invertebrates, the large-sized and the small-sized Daphnia species would show different morphological responses to predation threats. We followed changes in two morphological traits (relative length of the tail spine in D. pulicaria and of the helmet in D. mendotae) among different periods during summer according to YOY fish and invertebrate predation. We defined four YOY fish predation periods based on the presence of YOY perch in the pelagic zone of the lake and the relative abundance of Daphnia preys in their gut contents, and two invertebrate predation periods based on exclusive or mutual occurrence of the invertebrate predators. The large-sized (D. pulicaria) and the small-sized (D. mendotae) species showed different morphological responses to YOY fish and invertebrate predators, respectively. The tail spine ratio of the juveniles and adults of D. pulicaria did not change in response to YOY fish predation or to invertebrate predation. A gradual increase in the helmet ratio was observed in the small-sized D. mendotae over the summer period. This change was related to the co-occurrence of the invertebrate predators (Chaoborus and Leptodora) and to YOY fish predation. The warmer temperature cannot be accounted for helmet elongation since it was constant across depths, and not related with the co-occurrence of D. mendotae and YOY perch.

Total mercury in two distinct snowpacks averaged 1.25 and 4.21 ng L-1; the discharge-weighted concentration of influent streams averaged 0.76 ng L-1. The recent and pre-industrial Hg-T fluxes in atmospheric deposition to the catchment were estimated to be 0.57 and 0.23 μ g m(-2) but through retention within the catchment and/or re-volatilization from the melting snowpack, these decreased by 69% in the lake inflow. The spring freshet was the prime conduit for transporting Hg-T into Amituk Lake. Because of limited mixing of surface runoff with the lake water column during snowmelt, 59% of the Hg-T input was directly discharged through the outflow, 16% entered the lake water column where concentrations increased from 0.23 to 0.33 ng L-1 from June to August and 25% was deposited to the bottom sediments producing a sediment Hg-T flux of 3.1 μ g m(-2) © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Development of a Stock-Recruitment Model and Assessment of Biological Reference Points for the Lake Erie Walleye Fishery	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We developed an updated stock-recruitment relationship for Lake Erie Walleye Sander vitreus using the Akaike information criterion model selection approach. Our best stock-recruitment relationship was a Ricker spawner-recruit function to which spring warming rate was added as an environmental variable, and this regression model explained 39% of the variability in Walleye recruitment over the 1978 through 2006 year-classes. Thus, most of the variability in Lake Erie Walleye recruitment appeared to be attributable to factors other than spawning stock size and spring warming rate. The abundance of age-0 Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum, which was an important term in previous models, may still be an important factor for Walleye recruitment, but poorer ability to monitor Gizzard Shad since the late 1990s could have led to that term failing to appear in our best model. Secondly, we used numerical simulation to demonstrate how to use the stock recruitment relationship to characterize the population dynamics (such as stable age structure, carrying capacity, and maximum sustainable yield) and some biological reference points (such as fishing rates at different important biomass or harvest levels) for an age-structured population in a deterministic way.

J	Doyle, C; Schröder, S; Corella, JP; Garces, BV				Doyle, Connor; Schroder, Stefan; Pablo Corella, Juan; Valero Garces, Blas			Facies variability and depositional settings of Laguna Salada de Chiprana, an Iberian hypersaline lake	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Hypersaline lakes are unique depositional environments that are highly sensitive to climatic changes and anthropogenic pressures. Strong physicochemical gradients and the interplay of physical, chemical and biological depositional processes coupled to variable preservation potential associated with these environments generate highly complex sedimentary sequences. This study aimed to investigate spatio-temporal variations throughout the last three centuries in the sedimentary sequence of Laguna Salada de Chiprana, a small, permanent hypersaline lake situated in Northeast Spain. Short sediment cores reveal a complex sedimentary sequence influenced by detrital, chemically-induced and biogenically-influenced depositional processes. Nine facies associated with six sedimentological units represent six periods of environmental change beginning from approximately pre-1800 ad to the present day. They include: (i) a shallow, permanent saline lake that experienced brief periods of anoxia and drawdown between pre-1800 ad and ca 1850 ad. This was succeeded by: (ii) increased lake levels and detrital input to the lake from ca 1850 to 1900 ad; and (iii) a fall in lake levels and the establishment of microbial mats within bottom waters fluctuating between oxic and anoxic conditions from ca 1900 to 1950 ad. (iv) From ca 1950/1960 ad, a minor increase in lake levels and colonization of the littoral and sub-littoral zones by macrophytic vegetation occurred; followed by (v) falling lake levels and increasing salinity between 1960 and 1970 ad leading to widespread encrustation of macrophytes in the littoral zones by carbonate-evaporite precipitates. Finally (vi), from ca 1970 ad to the present day, falling lake levels, elevated salinity and widespread colonization of the lake by microbial mats characterize the sedimentary environment. Climate reconstructions and documentary evidence indicate that depositional evolution was mostly controlled by changes in farming practices and irrigation policies. Understanding Laguna Salada de Chiprana's depositional evolution contributes to future definitions of high-resolution palaeoenvironmental models, not only within the Iberian Peninsula but also in other locations where saline-hypersaline lakes act as a key source of palaeoenvironmental information.

Reproductive aspects of Galaxias platei (Pisces, Galaxiidae) in a deep lake in North Patagonia	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Reproductive characteristics of the native fish Galaxias platei were studied in Lake Moreno, an ultra-oligotrophic deep lake in North Patagonia. According to histological analysis of ovaries, G. platei presents synchronous oocyte development typical of a group-synchronous spawner. Mature oocyte diameter ranged from 1031 to 1419m. Based on the gonadosomatic index, annual spawning occurs between April and June (austral autumn) and is directly related to the water temperature of deeper strata (below 30m) where this species lives, but not with photoperiod. Female G. platei acquire sexual maturity at a length of 105mm, whereas males acquire sexual maturity at a length of 177mm. Delaying maturity to obtain higher fecundity, as well as maximum body size and longevity, indicates that G. platei is more specialised than the other South American Galaxias, G. maculatus, in terms of lifestyle. These specialised features are related to the stable environment G. platei lives in and indicate that it could eventually become a vulnerable species in unstable environments, such as the Patagonian lakes dominated by salmonids.

J	Melezhik, VA; Fallick, AE				Melezhik, VA; Fallick, AE			Palaeoproterozoic travertines of volcanic affiliation from a 13C-rich rift lake environment	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												The ca. 2.2 Ga Kuetsjarvi Sedimentary Formation (KSF) of the Pechenga Greenstone Belt, the north-east Fennoscandian Shield, contains the oldest travertines so far reported in the literature. The travertine-hosting succession is composed of flat-laminated, dolomitic stromatolites, micritic and allochemical dolostones, all formed in coastal plains of a rift-related playa lake system in an arid/semiarid climate. The travertines are categorised as thermal, autochtonous, spring travertine crust and spring orifice travertine mounds formed from hot water springs issuing at the playa lakeshore. The travertines are represented by crusts and small-scale mounds, both composed of a series of 1-5-mm thick dark-light couplets of fibrous dolomite crystals with compromise boundaries and radiating dolomite crystals. Travertines are composed of dolomite (Mg/Ca = 0.42-0.47), exhibiting a general lack of replacement textures. Travertines exhibit several phases of growth separated by dissolution processes and accompanied by precipitation of SiO2. The upper surface of crusts and mounds are often affected by desiccation joints and covered with thicker SiO2 veneer (delta O-18 = +18.6 parts per thousand). The host dolostones are characterised by delta C-13(carb) of +6.1-+8.8 parts per thousand (V-PDB) and delta O-18 values ranging from 11 parts per thousand to 19 parts per thousand (V-SMOW). Microcored samples of travertine dolomite exhibit delta C-13 and delta O-18 values ranging from -6.1 parts per thousand to + 7.7 parts per thousand and from 12.0 parts per thousand to 21.5 parts per thousand, respectively. The C-13-rich nature of the background stratified dolostones is caused by the 2.4-2.06 Ga global shift in C-13/C-12 carbonate carbon, associated with enhanced accumulation of C-org and perturbation of the global carbon cycle. The source of CO2 for the travertines is considered to be of volcanogenic origin with an initial delta C-13 value of ca. - 6.0 parts per thousand. Several processes contributed to carbon and oxygen isotope composition of travertine dolomite: (i) an initial CO2 loss at the spring orifice, (ii) water cooling and rapid CO2 loss during water transit, (iii) persistent evaporation from thermal water ponds/pools, and (iv) mixing with CO2 of ambient lake water enriched in C-13. Silica is thought to have been dissolved by groundwater from underlying sediments and been transported upwards by a mechanism of capillary rise due to dry climatic condition.

Size-specific growth and mortality of juvenile yellow perch in southwestern Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Yellow perch have experienced widespread recruitment failure within Lake Michigan since the early 1990s. Efforts to explain annual recruitment variability have primarily focused on the first year of growth, while the juvenile life stage has largely been neglected. juvenile yellow perch, age-0 through age-2, were collected annually from 2006-2010 in Illinois waters of Lake Michigan to assess temporal variability of size-at-age and size-selective mortality. Age-0 and age-2 total length at capture differed significantly between years with a maximum difference of 4.4 mm and 11.2 mm, respectively. First winter size-selective mortality was not observed for any year-class, however size-specific growth, with larger individuals growing faster than smaller counterparts, occurred during the first winter for all year-classes but 2006. Size-selective mortality was documented between age-1 and age-2 of the 2006 year-class with yellow perch less than 70 mm at age-1 not surviving through age-2. Though population level effects remain unknown, size-specific growth and mortality during the juvenile life stage may influence the size structure and year-class strength of yellow perch in southwestern Lake Michigan. Identification of size-selective mortality occurring beyond the first growing season highlights the significance of rapid growth during early life and the importance of investigating whole life stages to identify factors influencing year-class strength.

In boreal streams, juvenile salmonids spend substantial amounts of time sheltering in the streambed and in stream wood, presumably as a means of protection against the physical environment and from terrestrial endothermic predators. Relatively little is known about sheltering by salmonids in response to instream ectothermic predators. 2. We tested the effects of burbot (Lota lota) on the winter sheltering behaviour of PIT-tagged 0+ brown trout (Salmo trutta) in daylight and darkness. Sheltering in the streambed by trout was studied in the presence and absence of fine wood bundles. 3. We found that the use of streambed and fine wood was lower in darkness than in daylight. Availability of fine wood significantly decreased sheltering in the streambed, and this effect was more pronounced in daylight than in darkness. The presence of a burbot significantly decreased sheltering in the streambed, had no effect on use of fine wood and resulted in a higher number of exposed trout. 4. Our results indicate that juvenile brown trout decrease streambed sheltering in response to a burrowing, ectothermic predator.

There is no relationship between crude data on water temperature, conductivity, or aquatic vegetation and the relative abundance of the two species, but there is a striking correlation with presence or absence of trees. The absence of A. abbreviatum from heavily treed areas is associated with the paucity of suitable day time perching sites, and there may be competitive pressure exerted by A. vivida for the perching sites that are available. Argia vivida does not live at open sites because it requires trees for night-time roosts. Argia vivida roosted higher than A. abbreviatum in cages and held the body at a greater angle from the cage wall. The roosting posture of A. vivida is probably related to interception of solar radiation in the morning, and the body positions of both species possibly provide defence against predation.																			0008-347X	1918-3240				JUL-AUG	1997	129	4					733	743		10.4039/Ent129733-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.4039/Ent129733-4													WOS:A1997YB08100014

Denitrification and the nitrogen budget of a reservoir in an agricultural landscape	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Denitrification is an important process in aquatic sediments, but its role has not been assessed in the N mass balance of upper-Midwestern (USA) reservoirs that receive large agricultural riverine N inputs. We used a 4400-ha reservoir to determine the role of denitrification in the N mass balance and effectiveness in reducing downstream transport of NO3-N. Sediment denitrification was (1) measured monthly (March 2002 March 2003) at eight sites in the Lake Shelbyville reservoir in central Illinois using the acetylene inhibition, chloramphenicol technique, (2) scaled to the overall reservoir and compared to N not accounted for in a mass balance, and (3) estimated indirectly using long-term (1981-2003) mass balances of N in the reservoir. Denitrification rates in the reservoir were high during spring and early summer of 2002, when maximum NO3-N concentrations were measured (1014 mg NO3-N/L). We estimated that denitrification for the year was between 2580 and 5150 Mg N. Missing N from the mass balance was 3004 Mg N, suggesting that sediment denitrification was the sink. Areal rates of sediment denitrification in the reservoir ranged from 62 to 225 g N.m(-2).yr(-1), with rates a function of both denitrification intensity (mu g N.g dry mass.h(-1)) and the overall mass of sediment present. From 1981 to 2003 the average NO3-N inlet flux was 8900 Mg N/yr. About 58% of the total NO3-N input was removed, and annual NO3-N removed as a percentage of inputs was significantly related to reservoir retention time (average = 0.36 yr for the 23 years, range = 0.21-0.84 yr). By scaling denitrification in Lake Shelbyville to other reservoirs in Illinois, we estimated a sink of 48900 Mg N/yr. When combined with estimated in-stream denitrification, 60900 Mg N/yr was estimated to be removed by sediment denitrification. This reduces riverine export from Illinois to the Gulf of Mexico, where the flux during the 1990s was about 244000 Mg N/yr, and illustrates the importance of reservoir denitrification as an N sink in Midwestern agricultural landscapes.																			1051-0761	1939-5582				DEC	2006	16	6					2177	2190		10.1890/1051-0761(2006)016[2177:DATNBO]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/1051-0761(2006)016[2177:DATNBO]2.0.CO;2								17205896					WOS:000242849300010

Open water evaporation estimation for a small shallow reservoir in winter using surface renewal	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Evaporation is one of the main components of the energy and water balance of reservoir water behind dams and is a major component of water loss. Measurements in winter of sensible heat (H) for the small and shallow reservoir of Midmar Darn, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa were made using the Surface renewal (SR) method, a renewal model method that uses the average cubic air temperature structure function and eddy covariance (EC). The small magnitude of H during winter makes it difficult to test the reliability of the H estimates obtained using instruments and sensors mounted above the water Surface using the SR, renewal model and EC methods. Latent energy flux was estimated as a residual of the energy balance using additional measurements of net irradiance R-n above the water surface and the water-stored heat flux. The SR sensible heat flux (H-SR) Was estimated for heights of 1.0, 1.3, 1.9 and 2.5 m above the water surface using two air temperature time lags r of 0.4 and 0.8 s of the 10-Hz measurements. The SR method depends on a weighting factor alpha which represents the capability of the atmospheric turbulence to mix the scalar, within the air parcel to be renewed. The factor alpha was determined for each measurement height and time lag from the slope of a linear regression relationship forced through the origin of measured EC sensible heat flux (H-EC) values on the y-axis vs. H-SR or renewal model 14 on the x-axis All alpha values. obtained using the renewal model method were not statistically different from that obtained using the SR method for z = 1.0 in for both time lags. Using a calibration dataset. an average alpha value for the 1.0- and 1.3-m heights of 0.198 for r = 0.4 s and 0.245 for r = 0.8 s for the SR and renewal model methods was obtained. The 30-min H-SR, renewal model and H-EC estimates were often the smallest component of the energy balance (generally -40 to 40 W m(-2)) and compared reasonably well for the validation dataset. The heat storage flux G was larger in magnitude (0-200 W m(-2)) compared to the sensible heat flux. The SR, renewal model and EC latent energy fluxes, each Calculated as residuals of the energy balance, were almost the same in magnitude as the available energy flux R-n - G due to the relatively small magnitude of the sensible heat flux during the winter measurement period. The daily evaporation Fanged between 1.0 and 3.9 mm. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	HAIG, SM; ORING, LW				HAIG, SM; ORING, LW			DISTRIBUTION AND DISPERSAL IN THE PIPING PLOVER	AUK												Individually marked Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) were studied from 1981-1987 in Manitoba [Canada] and Minnesota [USA] relative to dispersal patterns of age and sex classes. Unlike monogamous passerines, males returned to former breeding sites only slightly more often than females. Dispersal distances did not differ between the sexes. Across North America, 24-69% of adults exhibited breeding-site fidelity, a variability equivalent to that among species of migratory shorebirds. Distribution of Piping Plover habitat across the species range accounts for some of this variability: birds used local sites if they were available, rather than disperse long distances. Similar to most migratory shorebirds, few (1.6-23%) Piper Plover chicks returned to natal sites to breed. No difference was found in return patterns between first-year males and females, nor in distances either sex dispersed from natal sites. First-year birds were found in the vicinity of their natal sites when habitat was available. During winter, birds from the Northern Great Plains and Great Lakes were seen primarily in mixed population flocks on the Gulf of Mexico. Piping Plovers from Atlantic coast breeding areas wintered further south on the Atlantic.																				1938-4254				OCT	1988	105	4					630	638		10.1093/auk/105.4.630	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/auk/105.4.630													WOS:A1988R209000003

The hills are rather steep, the slopes are short, and the fields have small contours. There are many lakes and rivers. The yield of plants is by 30-50% lower, and expenditure of labor input is twice as bigger than that of average value for the Republic. The field experiment was carried out during 1960-1997 on soddy - podzolic slightly and moderately eroded and moderately podzolized loam soils. The soil was poor in humus ( 14 g kg(-1) by Tiurin), and sufficiently rich in phosphorus and potassium (140 and 190 mg kg(-1) respectively). The trial was set up on Southern ( steppness 2degrees43' - 7degrees45') and Northern (5degrees45' - 8degrees10') hillsides with permanent experimental plots - bands. Different methods of soil management have been investigated : 1) Fallow; 2) Growing of perennial legumine - spiked grasses; 3) Growing of annual crops ( winter and spring annual crops, while farming systems consisting of using chemical means in a field rotation were started in 1993); 4) Permanent bare fallow while lucerne was sown in 1990. At the foot of each research plot there were reservoirs, insttalled to collect soil and run-off water. The data of long - term field experiment showed, that the perennial grasses protected soils of hilly relief from erosion very well. Here the losses of soil were least 0.05 t ha(-1) year. Grasses produced high yield ( on average 58.7 GJ ha(-1)), and increased amount of humus content by 7 g kg(-1). Annual crops produced amount of yield, on average, 26% lower than that obtained from the perennial legumine - spiked grasses sward, and soil and nutrients losses were also higher than that from the sward.																									2000							31	37																WOS:000177681500005

Estimating Wetland Connectivity to Streams in the Prairie Pothole Region: An Isotopic and Remote Sensing Approach	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Understanding hydrologic connectivity between wetlands and perennial streams is critical to understanding the reliance of stream flow on inputs from wetlands. We used the isotopic evaporation signal in water and remote sensing to examine wetland-stream hydrologic connectivity within the Pipestem Creek watershed, North Dakota, a watershed dominated by prairie-pothole wetlands. Pipestem Creek exhibited an evaporated-water signal that had approximately half the isotopic-enrichment signal found in most evaporatively enriched prairie-pothole wetlands. Groundwater adjacent to Pipestem Creek had isotopic values that indicated recharge from winter precipitation and had no significant evaporative enrichment, indicating that enriched surface water did not contribute significantly to groundwater discharging into Pipestem Creek. The estimated surface water area necessary to generate the evaporation signal within Pipestem Creek was highly dynamic, varied primarily with the amount of discharge, and was typically greater than the immediate Pipestem Creek surface water area, indicating that surficial flow from wetlands contributed to stream flow throughout the summer. We propose a dynamic range of spilling thresholds for prairie-pothole wetlands across the watershed allowing for wetland inputs even during low-flow periods. Combining Landsat estimates with the isotopic approach allowed determination of potential (Landsat) and actual (isotope) contributing areas in wetland-dominated systems. This combined approach can give insights into the changes in location and magnitude of surface water and groundwater pathways over time. This approach can be used in other areas where evaporation from wetlands results in a sufficient evaporative isotopic signal. Plain Language Summary Connectivity of wetlands within watersheds is critical to wetland function at local-to-landscape scales. However, actual measures of connectivity between wetlands and streams at the watershed scale are difficult to make, but critical for quantifying these functions, and for supporting policy and decision making. In this manuscript, we combine and compare direct field measurements of connectivity using stable isotopes of water, and remotely sensed measurements of connectivity using Landsat data. We found that prairie-pothole wetlands contributed significant amounts of water to the perennial stream from high to low-flow conditions. This wetland water flowed through surface water connections and not through groundwater flow paths. Hydrologic connectivity between prairie-pothole wetlands and the stream was dynamic, fluctuating with streamflow. Combining the isotopic and Landsat approaches to estimating contributing area appears to be a promising technique for determining potential and actual contributing areas in these flat wetland-dominated systems.

We analyzed biotic and isotopic paleolimnological proxies to reconstruct past climate from a lacustrine sediment core, with a basal age of similar to 5500aBP, in southern Spitsbergen (77 degrees N). We used fossil Chironomidae assemblages to quantitatively reconstruct past mean July air temperatures and stable oxygen isotope values (delta O-18) of these fossils to estimate changes in mean annual air temperature. These proxy records are strikingly similar and show that the coldest anomaly since the mid-Holocene occurred between 350 and 50calaBP, during the 'Little Ice Age', whereas the warmest period in the summer temperature record occurred between 5500-5000 and similar to 2000calaBP. Our findings indicate that the natural long-term air temperature dynamics in our study area are most likely connected to solar minima and positive feedback mechanisms from sea-surface temperature maxima. The results also highlight that the recent temperature increase is unprecedented in its rate with a similar to 2 degrees C increase in the summer temperatures during the past similar to 50 years.

The late summer crustacean zooplankton in western U.S.A reservoirs reflects ecoregion, temperature and latitude	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												We tested whether the crustacean zooplankton species composition and size structure (which are important determinants of energy flow in plankton food webs) during late summer in reservoirs would be related to ecoregional designations, catchment land use, temperature and latitude. We also examined whether the predictions of decreasing cladoceran body size with decreasing latitude (as observed for natural lakes) would be valid for reservoirs. Zooplankton samples were collected in late summer 2010 from 102 western U.S. reservoirs distributed over three major ecoregions from 32.5 to 48.6 degrees N latitude. Large-bodied cladocerans (Daphnia pulex complex) and cyclopoid copepods (Diacyclops thomasi) were found in deeper, cooler reservoirs with forested catchments (Northwestern Forested Mountains). Small-bodied cladocerans (Daphnia retrocurva, Diaphanosoma spp. and Chydorus sphaericus) and cyclopoid copepods (Tropocyclops prasinus) were more common in productive reservoirs in catchments influenced by agriculture (Great Plains). Small-bodied cladocerans (Bosmina longirostris) dominated the otherwise modest crustacean zooplankton in reservoirs located in catchments dominated by evergreen shrub vegetation with limited forestation (Western Xeric). Calanoid copepods also displayed clear distribution by ecoregion. Increasing water temperature and decreasing latitude were associated with smaller mean Daphnia and cladoceran body lengths and lower absolute biomass of daphniids. Daphniids were rare or absent in warm waters (i.e. below 36(o) N latitude and/or from sites located <500m altitude). Species composition and mean body size of the cladoceran zooplankton were consistent with the feeding habits of the common planktivorous fish - salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) and lake trout (Salvelinus spp.) in the Northwestern Forested Mountains, gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) in the Great Plains and threadfin shad (Dorosoma petenense) in the Western Xeric ecoregion. Our study indicates that the taxonomic composition and size structure of the cladoceran zooplankton in reservoirs are highly connected to ecoregional attributes such as catchment land use, temperature and latitude as has been observed for natural lakes.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	2014	59	6					1173	1186		10.1111/fwb.12338	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12338													WOS:000333964700006

Eight sites were selected over a 54 km reach between Lock 1 and Nildottie and growth rates estimated by monitoring mean cell density in time-aligned 'parcels' of water as they travelled downstream. Discharge at Lock 1 during the period of study (3000-5000 ML day(-1)) typified summer entitlement flows to South Australia. A large, shallow floodplain lake (lagoon), with an hydraulic connection to the river, supported a large population of cyanobacteria in summer, but inputs to the main channel did not substantially affect the abundance and composition of river phytoplankton. Mean net growth rates of Anabaena circinalis and A. flos-aquae f. flos-aquae were 0.132 and 0.176 day(-1), respectively, although individual rates varied from positive to negative. In contrast, the mean growth rate of the filamentous diatom Aulacoseira granulata was -0.15 day(-1), reflecting a decrease in population size with advection downstream. Mean cell densities of the three species did not exceed 5000 cells mL(-1) throughout the study. Growth bioassays conducted in the laboratory indicated that nitrogen was often the nutrient limiting algal growth, although it was not established whether nitrogen was limiting in situ. A conceptual model is presented, linking these findings with those of other work on the lower River Murray, to summarize the physical and chemical environmental factors governing the abundance of cyanobacteria in this reach of the river.

Interannual variations in the areas of thermokarst lakes in Central Yakutia	WATER RESOURCES												At present, close attention is given to studies of thermokarst lakes from the standpoint of cryolite zone response to global climate warming. However, other factors, which have an effect on the variation in areas of lakes, in particular, the atmospheric precipitation, receive little attention, while the atmospheric precipitation is one of the main sources of water recharge for many water objects. In this connection, interannual variations in the areas of lakes as a function of precipitation were analyzed on the territory of Central Yakutia. The studies were based on the analysis of space images taken at different time. As the result, it was shown that precipitation has a considerable effect on variations in the areas of thermokarst lakes; there is a direct relationship between variations in lake areas and precipitation; only some single high-water or low-water years have no effect on these variations. Variations in areas of lakes during summer were also analyzed with a view to use the results in choosing the images for studies of interannual variations. It has been revealed that the areas of thermokarst lakes decrease from June to August; this means that the images obtained within a short period at the end of the summer period should be used.																			0097-8078	1608-344X				MAR	2013	40	2					111	119		10.1134/S0097807813010107	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0097807813010107													WOS:000316200900002

A low level of numbers and small proportions of larger forms, found in this lake, especially of crustaceans, seem to indicate an impact of the intensive feeding of the phytophagous fish. Narrow variation in zooplankton numbers during the season and an early appearance of summer forms in the rotifer community indicate that the abundance and structure of the zooplankton of the lake are intensively affected by higher water temperatures.																			0070-9557						1988	36	1-2					245	260																WOS:A1988U315900013
J	Little, JL; Smol, JP				Little, JL; Smol, JP			A chironomid-based model for inferring late-summer hypolimnetic oxygen in southeastern Ontario lakes	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Hypolimnetic oxygen depletion has been accelerated in many lakes due to cultural eutrophication. However, the extent and magnitude of environmental change is difficult to ascertain due to the lack of historical records. Larval Chironomidae (Diptera) are useful proxy indicators of oxygen, as they show a wide range of tolerances to oxygen conditions and their chitinous head capsules preserve well in lake sediments. Using paleolimnological techniques, chironomid assemblages from the surface sediments of 42 southeastern Ontario lakes were related to environmental conditions. Hypolimnetic oxygen conditions, measured as the average end-of-summer hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (AvgDO((Summ))), explained the most variation in the chironomid assemblages, whereas dissolved inorganic carbon, the Anoxic Factor, max. depth and total phosphorus concentrations were also correlated with assemblage composition. Based on the relative abundances of 45 chironomid taxa, a robust, partial least squares (PLS) regression transfer function for AvgDO((Summ)) was constructed (r(2) = 0.74, r((jack))(2) = 0.58, n = 40). This new transfer function should allow paleolimnologists to directly track past trends in hypolimnetic oxygen levels.

The phenomenon of global warming has led to the formulation of predictions in relation to changes in the distribution of species, in the latitudinal dimension, both at intralacustrine, or small streams levels. The aim of the present work includes three main objectives: a) to compose general and updated picture of the latitudinal distribution range of native and alien fishes, b) to analyze the historical changes in the relative abundance of Percichthys trucha, Odontesthes sp., and salmonids in lakes and reservoirs, and c) to relate the diversity and relative abundance of native and salmonid fishes to the environmental variables of lakes and reservoirs. We analysed previous records and an ensemble of data about new locations along the northern border of the Patagonian Province. We compared current data about the relative abundance of native fishes and salmonids in lakes and reservoirs, with previous databases (1984-1987). All samplings considered were performed during spring-summer surveys and include relative abundance, as proportions of salmonids, P. trucha, and Odontesthes sp. For the first time, we found changes in fish assemblages from twenty years back up to the present: a significant decline in the relative abundances of salmonids and an increase of P. trucha. We studied the association between the diversity and relative abundance of native and salmonid fishes and the environmental variables of lakes and reservoirs using Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Relative abundance showed mainly geographical cues and the diversity relied largely on morphometric characteristics. Relative abundance and diversity seem to have a common point in the lake area, included into the PAR concept. Native abundance and alien diversity were negatively related with latitude. Greater native diversity was observed in lakes with high PAR compared with salmonids. Historical changes such as southward dispersion, relative abundance changes, and geographical patterns for relative abundance and diversity are basic concepts needed not only in future research but also in management design for Patagonian fish populations.

During the summer of 2018, the ichthyofauna of lower Estreito stream was sampled by beach hauls applied in 17 random points distributed in a stretch of ca. 2km. Measurements at the sampled stretch revealed salinities between 19.3 to 31.3 ppt, characterizing the studied system as polyhaline/euhaline during summer. The sample of 4,533 specimens revealed the occurrence of 20 species, being the great majority marine-dwelling. The most abundant species were the anablepid Jenynsia lineata (70.3%), the cichlid Geophagus brasiliensis (19.3%) and the the mugilid Mugil curema (7.5%). The highest relative biomass was recorded for J. lineata, followed by M. curema and G. brasiliensis. The dominance of marine-dwelling species in the assemblage composition and the high abundance of limnic-estuarine J. lineata corroborate previous studies conducted in other washouts of Rio Grande do Sul.					; Gava, Adriana/I-2900-2015	Quintela, Fernando/0000-0002-8652-0642; Gava, Adriana/0000-0002-2650-4069													1676-0603						2019	19	1							e20180585	10.1590/1676-0611-BN-2018-0585	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1676-0611-BN-2018-0585													WOS:000448805400001

In addition to the geologic structure of the basin, Harmancik Chromium Mines are one of the most important inorganic pollution sources for the basin and also for Uluabat Lake. In the present study, water, sediment and fish (Squalius cii, Capoeta tinca and Barbus oligolepis) samples were collected seasonally from eight stations (one of them was on the Kinik Stream where the Harmancik Chromium Mines is located on and one of them was on the Dursunbey Stream) on the Emet Stream Basin. Some limnological parameters (pH, conductivity and total hardness) in water and Cr, Ca, Mg, Ni and Mn levels in biotic (muscle, gill, liver and kidney tissues of fishes) and abiotic (water and sediment) components of basin were determined to evaluate the effects of Harmancik Chromium Mines on the system. Cluster Analysis, Factor Analysis, Pearson Correlation Index, One Way Anova Tests, Scatter dot Comparing and Matrix plot Distribution Diagrams were applied to the results in order to estimate the data properly. Water samples were evaluated according to the water quality criteria for Turkey and sediment samples were evaluated according to the sediment quality criteria. According to data obtained, statistically significance differences were identified between Kinik and Emet Streams according to Cr and Ni accumulations in water and sediment. Chromium levels of Kinik Stream were extremely higher an average of 153 times for water and 10 times for sediment than uncontaminated stations. Water and sediment quality of Emet Stream were decreasing after falling the Kinik Stream and increasing after falling the Dursunbey Stream. It was also determined that, the amount of chromium in muscle tissues of three fish species were much higher than the limit value of 0.15 mg kg(-1) that FAO identified.					; Tokatlı, Cem/AAN-3814-2021	tokatli, cem/0000-0003-2080-7920; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				MAR	2014	71	5					2185	2197		10.1007/s12665-013-2624-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-013-2624-4													WOS:000330992400017

The relationship between summer temperatures and melt is found to be exponential near the melting temperature. We propose a variety of simple models that are calibrated using measured discharge from a number of streams draining from ten glaciers in Taylor Valley. The surface melting rate is constrained by mass-balance measurements from four of the glaciers. A model based solely on temperature produced good results (coefficient of determination, r(2) = 0.71) for the south-facing glaciers, but poor results for the north-facing glaciers (r(2) < 0). The inclusion of a solar radiation index increased the modeled melt from the north-facing glaciers and thus improved the results (r(2) = 0.73) for the north-facing glaciers, with little change from the south-facing glaciers. Including a wind index did not improve the correlation between modeled and measured runoff.

J	Aydin, F; Erlat, E; Türkes, M				Aydin, Fulya; Erlat, Ecmel; Turkes, Murat			Impact of climate variability on the surface of Lake Tuz (Turkey), 1985-2016	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												Lake Tuz is a hypersaline lake located on the Central Anatolia plateau. The lake is one of the most important wetlands in Turkey, due to its unique ecosystem and biota, but it has been degraded due to the loss of most of its water-covered area. This study analyzes the changes at the surface of Lake Tuz over the past 32 years and discusses the relationship between this change and climatic factors. This study was made in two parts: (1) surface changes of the lake during the period 1985-2016 were evaluated based on satellite images, and (2) the relationship between surface change and climatic factors was studied using standardized precipitation index (SPI), Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), and Erinc aridity index (EAI). Even though standardized spring precipitation at Lake Tuz Basin have not revealed any statistically significant long-term trend during the study period, it tended to decrease apparently during a long period from the year 2001 to 2013. This drought period was also evident in the series of 12-month PDSI during the 2002-2009 periods along with the years of 2012 and 2013. It is detected a statistically significant negative relationship between the salt-covered areas and EAI (r = - 0.63) in the long term (1985-2016). For the first period prior to the 2000s, the relationship between EAI and the salt-covered area was weaker (r = - 0.46), mostly because the lake was not significantly affected by the lack of precipitation yet due to the sufficient groundwater level. Since about 2000, groundwater withdrawals, rising temperatures, and severe and more frequent droughts strengthened the relationship between the lake's salt-covered area and EAI (r = - 0.88). Precipitation records of Lake Tuz Basin showed a significant negative relationship with the indices of North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Arctic Oscillation (AO), and winter North Sea Caspian Pattern during the study period. The persistence of NAO and AO indices in a positive phase over the last 20 years has partly explained the decrease in the water-covered area observed in the lake.					; Aydin-Kandemir, Fulya/AAQ-1166-2021; Türkeş, Murat/JUF-2348-2023; Erlat, Ecmel/JXW-7398-2024	Aydin Kandemir, Fulya/0000-0001-5101-6406; 													1436-3798	1436-378X				JUN 1	2020	20	2							68	10.1007/s10113-020-01656-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-020-01656-z													WOS:000538060200001

Chemical evolution of thermal waters and changes in the hydrothermal system of Papandayan volcano (West Java, Indonesia) after the November 2002 eruption	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Papandayan is a stratovolcano situated in West Java, Indonesia. Since the last magmatic eruption in 1772, only few hydrothermal explosions have occurred. An explosive eruption occurred in November 2002 and ejected ash and altered rocks. The altered rocks show that an advanced argillic alteration took place in the hydrothermal system by interaction between acid fluids and rocks. Four zones of alteration have been defined and are limited in extension and shape along faults or across permeable structures at different levels beneath the active crater of the volcano. At the present time, the activity is centered in the northeast crater with discharge of low temperature fumaroles and acid hot springs. Two types of acid fluids are emitted in the crater of Papandayan volcano: (1) acid sulfate-chloride waters with pH between 1.6 and 4.6 and (2) acid sulfate waters with pH between 1.2 and 2.5. The water samples collected after the eruption on January 2003 reveal an increase in the SO4/Cl and Mg/Cl ratios. This evolution is likely explained by an increase in the neutralization of acid fluids and tends to show that water-rock interactions were more significant after the eruption. The evolution in the chemistry observed since 2003 is the consequence of the opening of new fractures at depth where unaltered (or less altered) volcanic rocks were in contact with the ascending acid waters. The high delta S-34 values (9-17 parts per thousand) observed in acid sulfate-chloride waters before the November 2002 eruption suggest that a significant fraction of dissolved sulfates was formed by the disproportionation of magmatic SO2. On the other hand, the low delta S-34 (-0.3-7 parts per thousand) observed in hot spring waters sampled after the eruption suggest that the hydrothermal contribution (i.e. the surficial oxidation of hydrogen sulfide) has increased.

Our study examined the amount of floating debris and actual conditions experienced during the summer each year in an artificial lake located in the temperate region for 26 y. In particular, the rainfall and inflow characteristics were compared with the main influential factors for transporting floating debris to the reservoir. The maximum daily rainfall and inflow were important variables in the meteorological and hydrological characteristics of the reservoir operation during the summer. When these factors were influenced, most of the floating debris that was widely scattered in the watershed was supplied by the rapid flow of streams and rivers. The range and mean value of the floating debris weight accumulated within the reservoir were 421.0-34,137.0 m(3) y(-1) - and 8,758.4 m(3) y(-1), respectively, and the difference between the years was very large. The maximum daily inflow was positively correlated with maximum daily rainfall (r = 0.843, p < 0.05). Based on linear regression, the regression between the floating debris and the maximum daily inflow (r(2) = 0.9092, p < 0.001) showed a better fit than that between the floating debris and the maximum daily rainfall (r(2) = 0.8250, p < 0.001). They showed an almost linear relationship, and the floating debris distribution above and below 20,000 m(3) y(-1) was contrasted. In addition, the frequency distribution of the event was relatively dense below 120 mm d(-1) of rainfall and below 3,000 m(3) d(-1) of inflow, and the event was rare as the maximum daily rainfall and inflow increased. Finally, the average load of floating debris per unit area of the watershed was approximately 2.1 m(3) km(-2), and further details on the loading should be understood in terms of effective pollutant management.

Given their sensitivity to climate change, it is crucial to understand the underlying mechanisms of these hazards in the context of global warming to mitigate mountain disaster risk. This study focuses on the Rangda catchment along the CL (-Tibet) Railway on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, a region prone to various snow- and ice-related hazards. Through field investigations, remote sensing analyses, and numerical simulations, we characterized the spatial distributions and potential impacts of snow, glaciers, and glacial lakes in the catchment. The catchment hosts 28 glaciers covering 53.05 km2 and five glacial lakes, with Zala Lake and Dalong Lake being prominent. Notably, Zala Lake has undergone significant expansion over the past three decades. The entire catchment is snow-covered to varying depths during winter and spring, contributing to frequent snow avalanches and icefalls, particularly those originating from the Zangburi Glacier. These events have affected the makeshift road that is used for construction and pose a potential threat to the auxiliary tunnel exits and the Rangda Bridge. Although no current debris flows have been observed, the potential for glacial lake outburst floods exists due to ongoing climate warming and glacial retreat. Further simulations and exposure analyses indicate that the primary disaster-causing patterns of snow- and ice-related hazards in the catchment are snow avalanches, icefall-dam-outburst-debris chains, and glacial lake outburst debris flows. The study also examined the risks faced by engineering facilities along the ST railway in the catchment and proposes disaster reduction strategies. This research enhances the understanding of snow- and ice-related hazards in the region and provides insights for disaster mitigation strategies along the ST Railway.

MINERAL, CHEMICAL, AND ISOTOPIC EVIDENCE OF SALT SOLUTION AND CRYSTALLIZATION PROCESSES IN OWENS LAKE, CALIFORNIA, 1969-1971	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												As a consequence of the 1969-70 flooding of normally dry Owens Lake, a 2.4-m-deep lake formed and 20% of the 2-m-thick salt bed dissolved in it. Its desiccation began August 1969, and salts started crystallizing September 1970, ending August 1971. Mineralogic, brine-composition, and stable-isotope data plus field observations showed that while the evolving brine composition established the general crystallization timetable and range of primary and secondary mineral assemblages, it was the daily, monthly, and seasonal temperature changes that controlled the details of timing and mineralogy during this depositional process. Deuterium analyses of lake brine, interstitial brine, and hydrated saline phases helped confirm the sequence of mineral crystallizations and transformations, and they documented the sources and temperatures of waters involved in the reactions. Salts first crystallized as floating rafts on the lake surface. Natron and mirabilite, salts whose solubilities decrease greatly with lowering temperatures, crystallized late at night in winter, when surface-water temperatures reached their minima; trona, nahcolite, burkeite, and halite, salts with solubilities less sensitive to temperature, crystallized during the afternoon in summer, when surface salinities reached their maxima. However, different temperatures were generally associated with crystallization (at the surface) and accumulation (on the lake floor) because short-term temperature changes were transmitted to surface and bottom waters at different rates. Consequently, even when solubilities were exceeded at the surface, salts were preserved or not as a function of bottom-water temperatures. Halite, a nearly temperature-insensitive salt, was always preserved. Monitoring the lake-brine chemistry and mineralogy of the accumulating salts shows: (1) An estimated 0.9 .times. 106 tons of CO2 was released to the atmosphere or consumed by the lake''s biomass prior to most salt crystallization. (2) After deposition, some salts reacted in situ to form other minerals in less than one month, and all salts (except halite) decomposed or recrystallized at least once in response to seasons. (3) Warming in early 1971 caused solution of all the mirabilite and some of the natron deposited a few months earlier, a deepening of the lake (though the lake-surface lowered), and an increase in dissolved solids. (4) Phase and solubility-index data suggest that at the close of desiccation, Na2CO3 .cntdot. 7H2O, never reported as a mineral, could have been the next phase to crystallize.																			0016-7037	1872-9533				APR	1987	51	4					811	827		10.1016/0016-7037(87)90095-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(87)90095-0													WOS:A1987G912300005

Since then it has been found within four different river catchments including four localities along Ireland's largest river, the Shannon. While three of these Shannon occurrences may have been due to introductions with angling equipment or leisure craft, subsequent expansions will have resulted from natural spread. The dispersal of this clam within two temperate lakes of > 100 km(2) was examined over a six year period to the autumn of 2016. Downriver and down lake water flow and currents generated by wind result in young clams being distributed by means of a byssal dragline that would appear to explain the distributions obtained.																			2242-1300					SEP	2018	7	3					259	268		10.3391/bir.2018.7.3.06	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/bir.2018.7.3.06													WOS:000451023700006

Beach nourishment response and recent morphological evolution of Minnesota Point, Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Beach nourishments are a popular nature-based alternative to armoring for shoreline erosion mitigation, but nourishments have been criticized due to their environmental impacts and uncertain sustainability. Monitoring is often nonexistent or insufficient to constrain nourishment longevity and inform the renourishment interval required to maintain shoreline protection. This study uses a combination of topobathymetric surveys, high-resolution satellite-derived shorelines, and coastal engineering analyses to investigate the recent evolution of Minnesota Point and the fate of three beach nourishments constructed adjacent to littoral barriers. We use semi-empirical formulations for sediment compatibility, wave runup, and longshore sediment transport to inform the observed nourishment behavior. Minnesota Point experienced widespread foredune retreat averaging 7 +/- 2.8 m from 2009-2019 and 130,000 (70,000-140,000) m(3) of sediment was eroded during this interval. The 2019 nourishment at the Superior Entry was rapidly eroded by strong storms, losing >80% of the added beach width by the following spring. The 2020 and 2021 nourishments at the Duluth Entry retained >80% of the nourishment material at the time of the last topobathymetric survey in the fall of 2022, and satellite-derived shorelines indicate that the beach remained 10 m wider than pre-nourishment conditions at the end of 2023. Modeled longshore transport rates over the period 2009-2022 averaged 11,400 m(3) yr(-1) northwestward at the Superior Entry, nearly 3x greater than the 4000 m(3) yr(-1) southeastward transport modeled at the Duluth Entry. These observations show that differences in shoreline orientation, littoral sediment supply, and grain size compatibility can lead to contrasting beach nourishment longevities, and this study provides additional measurements of Minnesota Point's long-term morphological change which can help inform coastal resiliency efforts.																			0380-1330					AUG	2025	51	4							102459	10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102459	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102459													WOS:001540922200003
J	Brown, RJ; Bonadonna, C; Durant, AJ				Brown, R. J.; Bonadonna, C.; Durant, A. J.			A review of volcanic ash aggregation	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												Most volcanic ash particles with diameters <63 mu m settle from eruption clouds as particle aggregates that cumulatively have larger sizes, lower densities, and higher terminal fall velocities than individual constituent particles. Particle aggregation reduces the atmospheric residence time of fine ash, which results in a proportional increase in fine ash fallout within 10-100 s km from the volcano and a reduction in airborne fine ash mass concentrations 1000 s km from the volcano. Aggregate characteristics vary with distance from the volcano: proximal aggregates are typically larger (up to cm size) with concentric structures, while distal aggregates are typically smaller (sub-millimetre size). Particles comprising ash aggregates are bound through hydro-bonds (liquid and ice water) and electrostatic forces, and the rate of particle aggregation correlates with cloud liquid water availability. Eruption source parameters (including initial particle size distribution, erupted mass, eruption column height, cloud water content and temperature) and the eruption plume temperature lapse rate, coupled with the environmental parameters, determines the type and spatiotemporal distribution of aggregates. Field studies, lab experiments and modelling investigations have already provided important insights on the process of particle aggregation. However, new integrated observations that combine remote sensing studies of ash clouds with field measurement and sampling, and lab experiments are required to fill current gaps in knowledge surrounding the theory of ash aggregate formation.

Understanding the origin, frequency, amplitude, duration, and field behaviour associated with excursions is a forefront research area within solid Earth geophysics. Excursion events typically last a few thousand to tens of thousands of years; unlike full reversals, excursions are gen-erally not recorded around the globe. We present here a new palaeomagnetic record (Geomagnetic excursions) from a lacustrine sediment sequence (at times, punctuated by undersized horizons of the gravels) with extraordinarily stable sig-nals. Palaeomagnetic and rock magnetic investigations were performed on a 17-m-thick profile of unconsolidated sediments from Bagwalipokar palaeolake (Lat. 29 degrees 43'18''; Long. 79 degrees 28'42''; altitude 4167 ft), Binta Basin in the Kumaun Lesser Himalaya, situated in the zone of the active North Almora Thrust (NAT). A total of 540 oriented palaeomagnetic samples from 108 horizons (five samples per horizon) were collected from the section. The extrapolation of the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) date indicates that the whole section was depos-ited between 45 and 2.5 ka. Magnetic remanence is predominantly carried by magnetite alone. Virtual Geomagnetic Pole (VGP) latitudes were determined using mean declinations and inclinations. Two geomagnetic excursions were observed at younger levels [11.6-10 .5 m (15.5-14. 7 ka) and 15-11.7 m (8.0-2.85 ka)]. These geomagnetic excursions correlate with the recently reported younger Hawaiian lava flow excursions.

Myxomycete diversity and ecology in arid regions of the Great Lake Basin of western Mongolia	FUNGAL DIVERSITY												A systematic survey for myxomycetes in winter-cold deserts and steppes of western Mongolia resulted in a total of 333 records belonging to 36 species from 13 genera and 7 families. Physarum notabile as the most common species was recorded 72 times, but about one third of all species was classified as rare for the whole study area. Due to the very arid climate of the region, all specimens were obtained by applying the moist chamber culture technique. Maximum values for diversity and species richness were recorded in dry steppe/shrub and mountain steppe/tall shrub communities. whereas extrazonal grasslands and alpine steppes had the most depauperate myxomycete biota. Among three different groups of substrata (bark of shrubs, ground litter, and dung of herbivores) diverging trends in species richness and substrate specificity of the species were found: bark had the richest but least specific, dung the poorest but most specific myxomycete assemblage. A hierarchical cluster analysis carried out on the incidence-based Chao-Soerensen index clearly indicates a separation between myxomycete biotas of Eurasian, western North American and South American deserts, supporting the moderate endemieity model postulated for various other groups of microbes and protists.

A thunderstorm caused complete overturn of stratified water masses and substantially increased oxygen exchange across the air-water interface. Mixing reaerated bottom waters which stimulated benthic and near-bottom pelagic respiration by a factor of 4. Total community nighttime respiration increased from 8.4 to 15.1 g O2 .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. d-1 following storm passage, while community gross production increased 93 percnet. A net effect of storm-induced mixing was to decrease the level of heterotrophy in the lake. Analysis of storm data for coastal Louisiana indicates a high frequency of occurrence of summer storms of sufficient magnitude to completely mix shallow estuarine water bodies. Periodic mixing and reaeration of bottom waters may be an important mechanism that increases the habitat value of shallow water bodies to commercially important fishery species.

HYDROBIOLOGIA												Tropical macrophytes sold in the live garden trade are perceived as unlikely to invade temperate regions owing to climate mismatches. Here we study two tropical macrophytes (Pistia stratiotes and Eichhornia crassipes) not previously considered an invasion risk but which were recently discovered in the Great Lakes, and determine mechanisms that may be responsible for their continued presence including human introduction, reproduction through viable seeds and tolerance of winter conditions. Surveys conducted in 2011 and 2012 revealed recurrent presence of one or both species at some sites. Macrophytes in in situ enclosures failed to survive winter conditions, with plant health declining progressively prior to mortality. Water hyacinth seeds were field-collected, identified using Sanger sequencing, and germinated at 28 degrees C with or without scarification. Germination was highest for scarified versus non-scarified seeds. Human introduction was observed at two sites, one involving both species, the other only water hyacinth. These species likely persist through a combination of annual reintroduction (both species) and possibly by production of viable seed (water hyacinth). Macrophytes, particularly water hyacinth, that were not previously viewed as a threat to the Great Lakes owing to environmental incompatibility may need to be reassessed.					macisaac, hugh/AAE-3742-2020														0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2016	767	1					165	174		10.1007/s10750-015-2491-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-015-2491-y													WOS:000369001000013

Spring viremia of carp virus: A RT-qPCR assay and surveillance in Ontario from 2008 to 2012	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Spring viremia of carp (SVC) is a reportable contagious disease of fish that produces high economic losses in several species of fish, primarily in members of the family Cyprinidae. It is caused by a single-stranded negative sense RNA virus. In 2006, SVC was first reported in Canada at Hamilton Harbour, Ontario; this remains the only report of SVC virus (SVCV) in Canada. A one-step reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was validated and used to test samples collected for surveillance between years 2008 and 2012. The assay was demonstrated to be specific and had a sensitivity of 50 copies of RNA or 1 x 10 exp 3 PFU/ml from spiked tissue samples. A total of 1432 fish, representing 31 different species, from 35 locations around Ontario were examined using the RT-qPCR assay. SVCV was not detected using RT-qPCR in any wild-caught fish examined.

J	Fang, JY; Rao, S; Zhao, SQ				Fang, JY; Rao, S; Zhao, SQ			Human-induced long-term changes in the lakes the Jianghan Plain, Central Yangtze	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT												The Jianghan Plain, located in the Central Yangtze area of China, is famous for its freshwater lakes, but these have undergone dramatic changes in area and number as a result of increasing human activity. We analyze the changes in lakes with an area >= 1 km(2) from the 1950s to 1998, using historical land-cover information and remote sensing data. The changes showed two distinct periods: the 1950s-1978 and 1978-1998. During the former period, the number of lakes fell from 414 to 250 (-39.6%) and total area decreased from 3885.4 km(2) to 1839.1 km(2) (-52.7%). During the latter period, the number of lakes rose, from 250 to 258 (+3.2%), while the area covered increased from 1839.1 km(2) to 2144.4 km(2) (+16.6%). The rapid fall in numbers of lakes from the 1950s to 1978 was largely attributed to extensive impoldering (land reclamation through draining techniques), resulting in substantial negative ecological consequences, such as increased flooding and a decline in biodiversity. In contrast, the increase in lake numbers and area from 1978 to 1998 was mainly due to the implementation of government policy prohibiting impoldering along the Yangtze River, and the return of inundated arable lands for aquaculture by local people.

J	Leister, C; Hügler, M				Leister, Carolin; Huegler, Michael			Genome Analysis of Enterobacter asburiae and Lelliottia spp. Proliferating in Oligotrophic Drinking Water Reservoirs and Lakes	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Surface waters are one of the main sources for drinking water production, and thus microbial contamination should be as minimal as possible. However, high concentrations of coliform bacteria were detected in reservoirs and lakes used for drinking water production during summer months due to autochthonous proliferation processes. Here, we present the genomic analyses of 17 strains of Enterobacter asburiae and Lelliottia spp. proliferating in reservoirs and lakes with special focus on the hygienic relevance, antibiotic resistance, and adaptations to the oligotrophic environments. The genomes contain neither genes for the type III secretion system nor cytotoxins or hemolysins, which are considered typical virulence factors. Examination of antibiotic resistance genes revealed mainly efflux pumps and beta-lactamase class C (ampC) genes. Phenotypically, single isolates of Enterobacter asburiae showed resistance to fosfomycin and ceftazidime. The genome analyses further suggest adaptations to oligotrophic and changing environmental conditions in reservoirs and lakes, e.g., genes to cope with low nitrate and phosphate levels and the ability to utilize substances released by algae, like amino acids, chitin, alginate, rhamnose, and fucose. This leads to the hypothesis that the proliferation of the coliform bacteria could occur at the end of summer due to algae die-off. IMPORTANCE Certain strains of coliform bacteria have been shown to proliferate in the oligotrophic water of drinking water reservoirs and lakes, reaching values above 10(4) per 100 mL. Such high concentrations challenge drinking water treatment, and occasionally the respective coliform bacteria have been detected in the treated drinking water. Thus, the question of their hygienic relevance is of high importance for water suppliers and authorities. Our genomic analyses suggest that the strains are not hygienically relevant, as typical virulence factors are absent and antibiotic resistance genes in the genomes most likely are of natural origin. Furthermore, their presence in the water is not related to fecal contamination. The proliferation in reservoirs and lakes during stable summer stratification is an autochthonic process of certain E. asburiae and Lelliottia strains that are well adapted to the surrounding oligotrophic environment.					; Hugler, Michael/A-9155-2018; Hügler, Michael/A-9155-2018	Leister, Carolin/0000-0002-6940-0024; Hugler, Michael/0000-0002-2820-0333; 													0099-2240	1098-5336				JUL 26	2022	88	14								10.1128/aem.00471-22	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/aem.00471-22		JUL 2022						35862664					WOS:000829999400001

AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												We analyse trends and dynamics in time-series of recruitment in Smelt and Vendace in the Swedish large Lakes Vanern and Vattern, with particular emphasis on the importance of climate variability. Climate-related predictor variables in our analyses were air temperature, water temperature, ice coverage and duration of ice winters. The variation between years with successful recruitment and years with low recruitment was considerable in both species and especially for Vendace. Ultra-oligotrophic Lake Vattern was characterized by strong pulses in Vendace recruitment, occurring mainly in four year intervals. Smelt recruitment was positively related to recruitment pulses of Vendace. In meso-oligotrophic Lake Vanern, Vendace pursuit was more successful in years with long ice winters that lasted until the middle of March or longer. Smelt recruitment in Lake Vanern was positively correlated to the air temperature in April. There was no obvious synchrony in recruitment patterns between the two lakes. Recruitment of Smelt in Lake Vanern's two main basins was, however, positively correlated. The results indicated that climate factors may influence the recruitment of important pelagic species, but that the effects may differ between lakes, even though the systems are adjacent and situated at the same latitude.

J	LEHMANN, R				LEHMANN, R			SEDIMENTATION IN AN OLIGOTROPHIC ALPINE LAKE (KONIGSSEE) DURING SUMMER STAGNATION	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												In the oligotrophic Konigssee (Zm = 190 m, .hivin.Z = 98 m) sedimentation of particulate matter was measured during summer stagnation in 7 depth intervals between 10 and 170 m. Parameters to be tested for were dry weight, chlorophyll, organic matter and carbonates. The wind-protected site of the lake, which is almost free of human influence, the relatively small allochthonous inputs, the absent resuspension and the low trophic state determined sedimentation in a decisive manner. Measured sedimentation rates were 5-10 times less than in meso- and eutrophic lakes. Sedimentation in Koenigssee is due to autochthonous material and represents significant losses of phytoplankton biomass produced in the trophogenic layer. Investigations on mineralization of organic matter during sinking showed that the rate of decomposition is dependent on depth. It is greatest in the trophogenic layer (0-20 m) and is evident only down to 75 m depth. About 1/5 of the organic matter is still sinking to the bottom of the lake and serves as nutrient source for the benthos communities.																			0003-9136						1983	96	4					486	495																WOS:A1983QQ32400006

Gabriel			Neogene aridification and lake development in the Issyk-Kul basin, Kyrgyzstan	BASIN RESEARCH												Uplift of the Tian Shan range modified regional climate during Cenozoic aridification in Central Asia. This study presents facies analyses and Neogene oxygen and carbon isotopic records from magnetostratigraphically dated terrestrial sedimentary sections on the southern side of the intermontane Issyk-Kul basin in the Kyrgyz Tian Shan and Al-26/Be-10 isochron burial ages from the southern and eastern sides of the basin. The delta O-18 and delta C-13 data show a positive ca. 2 & PTSTHOUSND; shift in values between ca. 8 and 7 Ma and a change from a negative to a positive trend. This change is attributed to the upwind growth of the Kyrgyz, Kungey and Trans Ili (Zaili) ranges, which diverted the westerlies, thereby changing the Issyk-Kul basin from a windward to a leeward position, enhancing aridification and establishing the modern-day spring and summer precipitation regime within the basin. Two 4 to 5 Ma Al-26/Be-10 isochron burial ages constrain the onset of Sharpyl Dak deposition on the eastern side of the basin; southward paleocurrent directions there suggest the eastward growth of the Kungey range in the Pliocene. Increased subsidence on the southern side of the basin and local tectonically induced river system reorganization led to the commencement of lake formation at ca. 5 Ma, followed by a ca. 2 Ma local depositional hiatus. The transition from sandstones of the Chu sedimentary group to conglomerates of the Sharpyl Dak group, marking a change from fluvial-alluvial deposits to a proximal alluvial fan, is dated at 2.6-2.8 Ma by Al-26/Be-10 isochron burial dating on the southern side of the basin, driven either by tectonics or Northern Hemisphere glaciation. This study concludes that the late Miocene-Pliocene northward growth of Tian Shan significantly altered environmental conditions within the range, preventing the moisture-bearing westerlies from reaching the intermontane Issyk-Kul basin and promoting lake formation and expansion.					; Codilean, Alexandru/F-5285-2010; Meijers, Maud/LZH-5557-2025; fink, david/A-9518-2012; fink, David/A-9518-2012	Codilean, Alexandru/0000-0003-1895-5633; Wilcken, Klaus/0000-0002-6870-2047; Kudriavtseva, Anna/0000-0002-8710-9919; Hoke, Gregory/0000-0002-3720-3245; fink, david/0000-0001-7156-4602; Fulop, Reka-Hajnalka/0000-0002-3237-0319; Meijers, Maud J.M./0000-0003-2724-4980; 													0950-091X	1365-2117				JUN	2023	35	3					1193	1227		10.1111/bre.12751	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bre.12751		JAN 2023											WOS:000921636300001

An evaluation of a spectral fluorometer for monitoring chlorophyll a in New York State lakes	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Prestigiacomo AR, June SG, Gorney RM, Smith AJ, Clinkhammer AC. 2022. An evaluation of a spectral fluorometer for monitoring chlorophyll a in New York State lakes. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXX-XXX. The quantification of chlorophyll a in surface waters through sampling and laboratory extraction methods has limitations, including the lack of phytoplankton composition analysis and delayed analysis time. Recently, automated instruments have been developed to quickly provide estimation of total chlorophyll a and characterize phytoplankton composition into functional groups. Here, we analyzed a dataset of paired, laboratory-extracted chlorophyll a samples (Chl-a) and chlorophyll a estimated from a spectrofluorometer (FluoroProbe, bbe Moldaenke; FPChl-a) for comparability at several time scales. We found that FPChl-a was highly correlated to Chl-a (r > 0.8) but overestimated Chl-a by 1.5-2 times on average. Summer average FPChl-a was higher than summer average Chl-a, resulting in incorrect lake evaluations against selected thresholds. Linear least squares regression of Chl-a/FPChl-a was highly significant (P < 0.01) and demonstrated a good fit (r(2) > 0.75) but had high variability, consistent with FPChl-a performance values reported in the scientific literature. Factors such as FPChl-a magnitude and algal dominance were statistically important factors affecting the Chl-a/FPChl-a relationship. We developed a multiple linear regression method for postcalibrating FPChl-a to equivalent Chl-a values (adjusted FPChl-a) and applied it to the FPChl-a dataset. Adjusted FPChl-a values were unbiased and compared well with Chl-a (mean residual equal to 0 mu g/L). Adjusted FPChl-a summer averages resulted in correct waterbody evaluation in more than 90% of lakes. We propose that the FluoroProbe, properly postcalibrated to adjusted FPChl-a, can be used as a surrogate of Chl-a in open water monitoring applications, reducing the need for traditional laboratory Chl-a samples for lake monitoring and management.

In this study, we present a well-dated, ca. 9.4 kyr geochemical and grain size record derived from Lake Ximenglongtan, southwestern China. The record depicts the Holocene ISM evolution and multi-decadal to centennial abrupt precipitation change events superimposed on the long-term climate changes. The results indicate that precipitation was high during the first half of the Holocene from ca. 9.4 to 4.5 cal kyr B.P. but decreased over the later Holocene. On the multi-decadal to centennial time scale, our results show that a pronounced and prolonged drought event occurred between 7.6 and 7.0 cal kyr B.P. In addition, several other low precipitation events occurred at about 8.9, 6.3, 5.2, 4.2, 3.7, 2.5 and 1.7 cal kyr B.P., which correspond well with reported intervals of abrupt ISM weakening events. Our findings suggest that changes in solar activity may have primarily controlled the fluctuations of ISM intensity on the multi-decadal to centennial time-scale. Cooling of the North Atlantic climate and the interactions between tropical-ocean and atmosphere may have amplified the solar signal.

Relationships between hydrological and limnological conditions in lakes of the Slave River Delta (NWT, Canada) and quantification of their roles on sedimentary diatom assemblages	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Water chemistry and surface sediments were analyzed from 41 shallow lakes representing three previously-defined hydrological categories in the Slave River Delta, Northwest Territories, Canada, in order to identify relationships between hydrological and limnological conditions and their associations with recently deposited diatom assemblages. Evaporation-dominated lakes are physically removed from the influence of the Slave River, and are characterized by high alkalinity and high concentrations of nutrients and ions. In contrast, flood-dominated lakes tend to receive a pulse of floodwater from the Slave River during the spring thaw and have low alkalinity and low concentrations of most nutrients and ions. Exchange-dominated lakes are variably influenced by floodwaters from the Slave River and seiche events from Great Slave Lake throughout the spring thaw and open-water season, and are characterized by a broad array of limnological conditions that are largely dependent on the strength of the connection to these sources of floodwater. Specific diatom 'Cyindicator' taxa have been identified that can discriminate these three hydrological lake categories. Evaporation-dominated lakes are associated with high relative abundance of common epiphytic diatom taxa, while diatoms indicative of flood- and exchange-dominated lakes span a wide range of habitat types (epiphytic, benthic) but also include unique planktonic diatoms (Stephanodiscus and Cyclostephanos taxa) that were not found in surface sediments of evaporation-dominated lakes. The planktonic diatom taxa originate from the Slave River, and thus are indicative of river influence. In complex, remote, freshwater ecosystems like the Slave River Delta, integration of results from hydrological and limnological approaches provides a necessary foundation to assess present, past and future hydroecological responses to changes in river discharge and climate.

The aim of the present review is to discuss the phenomenon of wide pH range tolerance possessed by these microorganisms as a hidden character in perspective of their habitats, possible mechanisms, phylogeny, ecological and biotechnological relevance, and future perspectives. It is believed that the genome is a probable reservoir of the hidden variations. The extremophiles have the ability to adapt against the environmental change that is probably through the expression/regulation of the specific genes that were already present in the genome. The phenomenon is likely to have broad implications in biotechnology, including both environmental (such as bioremediation, biodegradation, and biocontrol), and industrial applications (as a source of novel extremozymes and many other useful bioactive compounds with wide pH range tolerance).

CARBONATE DEPOSITS IN THE LOWER JURASSIC NAVAJO SANDSTONE, SOUTHERN UTAH AND NORTHERN ARIZONA, USA	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												Carbonate strata constitute a minor proportion of the widespread eolian Lower Jurassic Navajo Sandstone but are vital for understanding the hydrological and paleoecological dynamics of the erg system. The carbonate lithologies are in the form of tufa (carbonate spring) mounds and lacustrine beds, predominantly limestone and/or dolomite with minor constituents of chert and clastics. The tufa mounds and lacustrine carbonate beds occur separately or together; where together, the springs are interpreted to have sourced water to the lakes. Where they are not associated with tufa mounds, the lacustrine carbonate beds may have formed where the water table intersected the topographic surface through seepage. Many of the deposits exhibit three common characteristics: (1) clastic facies in the carbonate beds that indicate proximity to the lake margin; (2) deformation of the lower beds of the carbonate units by catastrophic dewatering events; and (3) a variety of weathering features and evaporite crystal molds that indicate periodic subaerial exposure. These deposits were also the habitats of a rich terrestrial biota, including vertebrates, aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, and plants, including large trees. In addition to the tufa mounds, several other mound-like structures occur in the carbonate beds as stromatolite mounds, carbonate beds draped over primary topography, tepee structures, and accumulations around tree trunks.																			1527-1404	1938-3681				JUL	2017	87	7					740	762		10.2110/jsr.2017.42	http://dx.doi.org/10.2110/jsr.2017.42													WOS:000406236700005

However, other studies argue that the highest C accumulation in China's lakes occurred in the early Holocene, influenced by high summer insolation. The pattern and driving forces behind Holocene lacustrine C accumulation in eastern China remain controversial. In this study, carbon accumulation rate (CAR) records from eleven lakes in northern China and eight lakes in southern China were synthesized to examine variations in CAR between the two regions and to understand the factors driving these variations. The results reveal that CAR in northern China increased between 11 and 6 thousand calendar years before present (cal ka BP), as the strengthening summer monsoon resulted in increased precipitation, promoting the growth of vegetation in the lake's catchments and subsequently increasing terrestrial sediment and C input into lakes. Conversely, CAR in southern China decreased due to reduced precipitation, leading to a decline in sedimentation rate and C inputs in the lakes. After 6 cal ka BP, decreased precipitation and increased human activities in northern China reduced the forest cover, resulting in a decline in C input into lakes without reducing sediment inputs, which consequently led to a decrease in CAR. In southern China, higher precipitation and intensified human activities significantly increased sediment inputs without affecting C inputs, resulting in an increasing trend in CAR. Thus, human activities and the dipole pattern of precipitation created an inverse phase of C accumulation between northern and southern China in lakes throughout the Holocene. The study also highlights the importance of terrestrial C from the catchment in contributing to lacustrine C accumulation on large regional scale, as C in lake sediments was found to be closely associated with forest cover in the catchment.

GEOMORPHOLOGY OF THE LAKE SHEWA LANDSLIDE DAM, BADAKHSHAN, AFGHANISTAN, USING REMOTE SENSING DATA	GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Lake Shewa in northeastern Badakhshan, Afghanistan, was dammed sometime in antiquity when a large rock avalanche (sturzstrom) from the fault-shattered and strongly weathered Archean gneisses of the Zirnokh peaks to the north moved into the Arakht River valley. This rock avalanche dammed up the river and its tributaries to a dam thickness of c. 400 m, producing a 12-km-long lake that is as much as 270 m deep, leaving c. 80 m of freeboard to the top of the dam. At least four separate instances of slope failure have been mapped at the site of the landslide dam, as well as a rock glacier, using remotely sensed data, historical maps, and Google Earth (TM). Spring seepage through the dam face has caused several recent subsidiary debris slides, which if continued at a large enough scale for long enough, or with additional seismicity from the active strike-slip faults that cross beneath the landslide dam, could threaten its integrity. Otherwise the clean water that emerges from the dam face could be the source of an unvarying mini-hydroelectric power source, in addition to the agricultural irrigation that it provides at the present time.

Eyed eggs were imported from the Alsea River Trout Hatchery, Oregon, USA (latitude 44-degrees-N), to the Lake Rupanco Experimental Hatchery in Chile (latitude 41-degrees-S). This transfer of eggs resulted in a notable variation in the age and size at which fish smolted. A minimum smolting size of about 10 cm was observed in the first southern spring of life, when fish were 7-8 months old. Fish that did not reach this size smolted in the second spring of life at age 20 months. Based on our current understanding of the effects of environmental variations on smolt physiology, we offer guidelines for increasing the efficiency of smolt production for this anadromous salmonid in the Southern Hemisphere.																			0033-0779					JAN	1995	57	1					78	83		10.1577/1548-8640(1995)057<0078:SOHRST>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8640(1995)057<0078:SOHRST>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1995QG59200010
J	SUTER, W				SUTER, W			THE EFFECT OF PREDATION BY WINTERING CORMORANTS PHLACROCORAX-CARBO ON GRAYLING THYMALLUS-THYMALLUS AND TROUT (SALMONIDAE) POPULATIONS - 2 CASE-STUDIES FROM SWISS RIVERS	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. The effect of cormorant predation on one trout and two grayling populations was examined in two rivers in north-eastern Switzerland, the only sites in the country at present where both bird and fish data are sufficient for such an analysis. Cormorant densities were among the highest recorded on Swiss rivers. Fishery yield was used as a means of detecting fish population changes, because population size could not be measured directly. Two hypotheses were tested: strong cormorant predation results either in lower yields, without affecting long-term population dynamics (compensatory mortality), or destabilizes the prey population, with effects observed in over-fished populations (additive mortality). 2. No evidence was found to support predictions of a negative effect on fish population dynamics by cormorants. Predation intensity on grayling was positively correlated with yield in the largest grayling population of Switzerland. In the other river, grayling yield was unusually low after a cormorant influx in one winter. This had been taken widely as evidence of population depredation, but yield variation was mainly a function of angling effort and age structure in the grayling population. However, some compensatory effect between angling success and bird predation is possible. At the same time, a sudden decrease in trout yield was caused primarily by altered regulations for trout fishing. 3. Variations in growth rate, age structure and age at first maturity in the large grayling population were not related to cormorant predation, but to the strength of the recruiting cohort (age class 2). The biomass of young grayling also explained the intensity of cormorant predation pressure. Among the surviving grayling of any one winter, 10-16% bore marks of a recent cormorant attack, but to date no evidence exists for negative implications of such injury rates on grayling population dynamics.																			0021-8901					FEB	1995	32	1					29	46		10.2307/2404413	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2404413													WOS:A1995QL81700004

Intense seiche-like temperature oscillations developing after the ice-on have been encountered in a thin water layer above the sediments. The oscillations were initiated immediately after lake freezing by the release of the potential energy of the thermocline slope and existed for several weeks without appreciable external forcing. The oscillations were associated with a basin-scale internal waves existing in the lower stratified part of the water column. The weakness of the density stratification under ice ensured the long wave periods, exceeding the period of geostrophic inertial oscillations at the lake's latitude. As a result, two frequency peaks were present in the oscillations corresponding to two rotational waves, one of Kelvin-wave type and another of Poincar, type wave. The rotational character provided long dissipation times of the waves and allowed the oscillations to persist in lake several weeks. Temperature measurements in the upper several centimeters of the sediment demonstrated that oscillations of the near-bottom temperature produced vertical density instability and pore-water convection in the upper sediments.

J	Lund, S; Acton, G; Clement, B; Okada, M; Keigwin, L				Lund, Steve; Acton, Gary; Clement, Brad; Okada, Makoto; Keigwin, Lloyd			On the relationship between paleomagnetic secular variation and excursions-Records from MIS 6 and 7-ODP Leg 172	PHYSICS OF THE EARTH AND PLANETARY INTERIORS												This paper summarizes the pattern of paleomagnetic secular variation (PSV) and excursions within MIS 6-7 (130-243 ka) from the western North Atlantic Ocean - ODP Sites 1060-1063. Composite high-resolution PSV records (both directions and relative paleointensity) have been developed for each site and inter-compared. There are 65 correlatable inclination features, 67 correlatable declination features, and 15 correlatable paleointensity features in the four PSV records. We have used the results of Grutzner et al. (2002), who compared the calcium carbonate records of ODP Leg 172 sediments and tuned them with Milankovich cyclicity, to date our records. We also dated our PSV records by comparing our paleointensity variability with the study the PISO-1500 global paleointensity record. The two methods agree well. We use the Grutzner phase-shifted chronology to date and analyse our cores because it has lower age uncertainties (-+/- 2 ka). We noted two excursions in our PSV records - Excursions 7 alpha and 7 beta. These are equivalent to the Iceland Basin and Pringle Falls Excursions. Our revised age estimate for the Iceland Basin Excursion is 196 +/- 3 ka. Our revised age estimate for the Pringle Falls Excursion is 215 +/- 2 ka. Both are Class I excursions noted by 2-3 cycles of high-amplitude oscillatory inclinations and declinations. We note a strong similarity in the oscillatory kinematic pattern of the two excursions. We also note evidence for similar but lower amplitude directional PSV between and after the excursions. This complex pattern suggests that the dynamics of the regional dynamo process responsible for these excursions is a continuing process for more than 35 ky. We have carried out a statistical study of the PSV records over the interval 120-250 ka after removing all true excursional directions. We have averaged directions and paleointensity in 3 ka and 9 ka overlapping intervals to evaluate the space/time character of PSV and its geodynamo cause(s). We see significant PSV directional variability over 104 yr time scales that is regionally correlatable among the four sites. There is a notable pattern of angular dispersion variability with most time spent with low (-10 degrees) dispersion, with four shorter intervals of high (-25 degrees) dispersion. There are also four notable intervals of low paleointensity in all four records. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the four low paleointensity intervals and the four intervals of high angular dispersion. The Blake Event (123 +/- 3 ka) and Excursion 8a (238 +/- 2 ka) occur in two of the low intensity/high dispersion intervals that bound MIS 6/7. The two magnetic field excursions within MIS 7 (Iceland Basin and Pringle Falls Excursions) occur in one distinctive long (-35 ka) interval of low paleointensity/high dispersion interval.

Asbjorn			Biotic and abiotic effects on cohort size distributions in fish	OIKOS												Intraspecific variation in body size is common in animals and plants. Body size affects trophic interactions like foraging ability and vulnerability to predation, which in turn affect individual fitness as well as population stability and extinction risk. Experimental and theoretical work has shown that the size distribution of individuals within cohorts is strongly influenced by intraspecific competition for resources, often leading to skewed frequency distributions. However, little is known about the effects of environmental factors such as climate and eutrophication on the cohort size-structure of natural populations. We use a long-term time series of scientific monitoring of a freshwater fish (European perch Perca fluviatilis) to investigate the effects of density dependence, predation, nutrient availability, climate and the timing of spawning on the cohort size distributions. We find that the mean length of the fish is best predicted by the extrinsic factors phosphorus concentration and summer temperature, and the densities of the different age-classes, whereas the skewness of the length distribution is best predicted by phosphorus concentration, summer temperature, abundance of small fish, and the timing of spawning. Higher nutrient levels, temperatures and densities of small fish increase food availability and thus reduce competition, which is reflected in increased mean length and decreased skewness. The timing of spawning affects skewness presumably through changes in the initial size variation of the cohort and the length of the first growth season. Our results indicate that higher temperatures increase the mean length and decrease skewness due to the concurrent eutrophication of the lake. The study thereby highlights the potential impact of human-induced environmental change on the size structure of fish populations. More studies are needed to understand better the complex mechanisms through which these factors alter the intensity of intraspecific competition in fish communities.

In this study, a synoptic climatology of severe LES events over Lakes Erie and Ontario was created using an updated methodology based on previous studies with similar research objectives. Principal component analysis (PCA) coupled with cluster analysis (CA) was performed on a case set of LES events from a study domain encompassing both lakes, grouping LES events with similar spatial characteristics into the primary composite structures for LES. Synoptic scale composites were constructed for each cluster using the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR). Additionally, one case from each cluster was simulated using the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model to analyze mesoscale conditions associated with each of the clusters. Three synoptic setups were identified that consisted of discrepancies, mostly in the surface fields, from a common pattern previously identified as being conducive to LES, which features a dipole and upper-level low pressure anomaly located near the Hudson Bay. Mesoscale conditions associated with each composite support differing LES impacts constrained to individual lakes or a combination of both.

Detection of natural barriers to movement of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) within the Namakan River, Ontario	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Many populations of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque, 1817) are below historic population sizes, and migration barriers have likely contributed to some of these population declines. Dams and natural barriers can potentially isolate populations along a single river and can have a strong effect on the ability of lake sturgeon to move upstream. Along the Namakan River in Ontario, Canada, a series of natural rapids could impede movement of lake sturgeon and fragment the sturgeon into several small populations. Movement patterns of lake sturgeon were assessed using genetics and acoustic telemetry. Samples were collected from five locations along the river, each one separated by a rapid or falls, and were analyzed at 12 microsatellite loci. No significant genetic differences were observed between the five segments, indicating that the groups of lake sturgeon are not isolated. There were no significant differences in genetic diversity between the five segments. Therefore, migration is likely occurring both upstream and downstream. The acoustic telemetry study also confirmed bidirectional movement of adult fish. The natural rapids and falls along the Namakan River do not appear to be a significant barrier to movement of lake sturgeon, and the lake sturgeon within this river represent a single population.

J	Light, T				Light, T			Success and failure in a lotic crayfish invasion: the roles of hydrologic variability and habitat alteration	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. This paper examines the distribution, habitat relationships, and potential for spread of non-native signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) in streams of the Truckee River catchment, California, U. S. A. Crayfish associations with natural features and with impoundments and flow alteration were examined in a survey of 33 streams. Abundance changes were followed over 5 years, which included some of the highest and lowest flows on record, in three streams, two unregulated and one regulated. Movement of marked crayfish was studied in one 0.5 km stream reach just upstream from a reservoir. 2. Signal crayfish were most abundant in low-gradient streams and were positively associated with proximity to reservoirs ( both upstream and downstream). Crayfish were more likely to be found in regulated than unregulated sites, and did not occur in sites upstream of barriers, such as culverts, that separated them from reservoirs or lakes. 3. Crayfish declined in abundance in years following particularly intense and prolonged wet-season spates, leading to a negative association between crayfish abundance and both peak discharge and duration of bankfull flows. 4. Crayfish moved distances of up to 277 m, and at rates of up to 120 m day(-1), suggesting significant dispersal ability. Larger crayfish moved greater distances and were more likely to move downstream. Female crayfish showed a pattern of upstream movement in early summer and downstream movement late in the summer, opposite the pattern found in two other studies. 5. These results suggest that natural or artificial gradient barriers and, in regulated systems, management of flow regimes to include bankfull or greater flows may help to control invasive crayfish in streams.																			0046-5070					OCT	2003	48	10					1886	1897		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01122.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01122.x													WOS:000185347900015

Our results show relatively warm sea-surface temperatures before 2600 BP, about 2 degrees C higher than at present in summer, in addition to higher salinity suggesting relatively low freshwater inputs, thus low precipitation over the watershed. After 2400 years BP, an abrupt drop in sea-surface temperatures was recorded, followed by a decrease in salinity particularly pronounced until similar to 2000 years BP. After 1600 years BP, summer sea-surface temperatures and salinity stabilized around current values. The changes recorded in surface waters during the late Holocene can be associated with a regional shift in the hydroclimatic regime that led to a gradual decline of spruce (Picea) in pollen assemblages.					de Vernal, Anne/D-5602-2013														0277-3791	1873-457X				SEP 1	2024	339								108862	10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108862	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108862		JUL 2024											WOS:001286434100001

Low-water events in the south forebay of the dam adversely affected the operation of an industrial water intake in 2019. To elucidate the causes, records of measured water levels in the forebay were analyzed, and events threatening intake operations were identified. For each of the events, recorded water levels in Rainy Lake and the forebay, and dam operations were reviewed to identify underlying factors and conditions. A TELEMAC-2D numerical hydrodynamic model was then used to explore a broader range of hydraulic conditions potentially resulting in low water level events at the intake location. The results were used to characterize the complex inter-relationships between water levels in Rainy Lake, dam gate configurations and discharges, and water levels in the dam forebay. Recommendations for dam operators to reduce the risk of low-water level events at the intake were developed.																					978-1-032-34614-4; 978-1-003-32303-7; 978-1-032-34613-7				2024							672	679		10.1201/9781003323037-89	http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/9781003323037-89													WOS:001329507800089
J	Pendleton, WR; Taylor, MJ; Gardner, LC				Pendleton, WR; Taylor, MJ; Gardner, LC			Terdiurnal oscillations in OH Meinel rotational temperatures for fall conditions at northern mid-latitude sites	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												High-precision (similar to 0.5 K) measurements of OH Meinel (M) (6,2) rotational temperatures above the Bear Lake Observatory, UT (42 degrees N, 112 degrees W) during October 1996 have revealed an interesting and unexpected mean nocturnal pattern. Ten quality nights (>100 h) of data have been used to form a mean night for autumnal, near-equinoctial conditions. The mean temperature and RMS variability associated with this mean night were 203 +/- 5 K and 2.4 K, respectively, and compare very favorably with expectations based on Na-lidar measurements of mean tidal temperature perturbations over Urbana, IL (40 degrees N, 88 degrees W) during the fall 1996. Furthermore, this comparison shows that the 8-h tide was the dominant source of the mean nocturnal temperature variability in the OH M region during this period. Additional data, obtained at Fort Collins, CO (41 degrees N, 105 degrees W) in November 1997, illustrate the occurrence of an g-h component of OH temperature variability about two months after the equinox and show that daily amplitudes as high as congruent to 15 K are possible.																			0094-8276					JUN 15	2000	27	12					1799	1802		10.1029/2000GL003744	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2000GL003744													WOS:000087658000030

An Exploratory Survey of Summer Water Chemistry and Plankton Communities in Lakes near the Sutton River, Hudson Bay Lowlands, Ontario, Canada	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												We provide the first assessment of regional water chemistry and plankton (phytoplankton and crustacean zooplankton) for a suite of lakes near the Sutton River region of the north-central Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL). We use ordination analyses to examine the spatial variation in water chemistry and plankton across lakes, and to explore the factors that may explain this variation. Based on data collected during summer from 2009 to 2011, we found that in addition to geology, water chemistry was strongly influenced by a lake's proximity to salt water and the degree of permafrost development within its catchment. Phytoplankton composition varied across lakes based on differences in Water depth and nutrient concentrations, with non-filamentous cyanobacteria and chlorophytes more common in shallow lakes, and deeper lakes dominated by planktonic diatoms or filamentous cyanophytes. Crustacean zooplankton community composition and richness in the HBL lakes was similar to communities found in Ontario lakes in more temperate regions within the Precambrian Shield. These baseline data provide a foundation upon which future surveys in this climatically sensitive region may be compared.

Gross photosynthesis and lake community metabolism during the spring phytoplankton bloom	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Daily productivity determinations of linear photosynthetic electron transfer and of net and gross inorganic CO2 uptake were determined in situ throughout a 6-week sampling period of the spring phytoplankton bloom in Esthwaite Water in the English Lake District. Photosynthetic electron transfer rates, expressed as gross O-2 evolution, were determined from fast repetition rate (FRR) fluorometry and discrete laboratory measurements of the photosynthetic unit size. These gross O-2 evolution determinations were also made free from contemporaneous dark-adapted FRR measurements and the need for sample blanks. Net and gross CO2 uptake was determined from changes in total inorganic carbon calculated from in situ pH measurements. Two phases to the bloom were observed. An initial bloom was dominated by the diatom Asterionella formosa, while a secondary phase was characterized by an increase in flagellates and cyanobacteria. For both phases, daily FRR-based gross O-2 evolution and pH-based gross CO2 uptake were tightly coupled, suggesting that daily gross O-2 production was driving daily changes in CO2 assimilation and thus in community metabolism. This is the first investigation to show closely related rates of gross O-2 production and CO2 uptake measured in situ.					; Suggett, David/G-9212-2017; Maberly, Stephen/J-3361-2012	Geider, Richard/0000-0003-3276-047X; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2006	51	5					2064	2076		10.4319/lo.2006.51.5.2064	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2006.51.5.2064													WOS:000240673800011

MORPHOGENESIS OF HOLLOW BULBOUS GYPSUM STRUCTURES ALONG A BRINE SPRING IN NORTHEAST ALBERTA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MINERALOGY AND PETROLOGY												The stromatolite tufa mound at La Saline Lake developed along the Athabasca River Valley in northeast Alberta consist s of a 30 m-high structure with a multi-meter thick caprock of strati fi ed gypsum. The gypsum caprock developed when the meteoric-charged groundwater channeled along shallowly buried Upper Devonian limestone was redirected deeper and encountered anhydrite beds of the Middle Devonian Prairie Evaporite Formation, only 175-200 m below. Discharge of the sulfate-saturated brine from the central vent of the gypsum caprock eventually ceased and the flow was redirected to the western lakefront bank of the tufa mound. This active brine spring, characterized by total dissolved solids level of similar to 79,000 mg/L, is channeled along a 25 m gully toward La Saline Lake. The bottom sediment in each of the interconnected brine pools along the gully consists of a 2-4 cm-thick calcite-gypsum thrombolite and an overlying gypsum crust. This sulfate crust developed as densely packed arrays of hollow botryoidal to hemispheroidal and bulbous gypsum protuberances, each 0.5-1.5 cm long, that extend upward into the brine. This is the fi rst documented example of bulbous protuberances of gypsum that developed within brine pools with hollow interiors. The unusual hollowness of these bulbous gypsum protuberances resulted from the rapid encasement of gas bubbles that ascended from the underlying thrombolite ooze and were trapped within the overlying microbial mats and meshwork of gypsum crystallites on the surface of the bottom pool sediment. Nanoscale biomineralization of gypsum developed along the parallel arrays of microbial stalks within the enveloping mat, resulting in a meshwork of parallel aligned crystallites that encased the surfaces of the trapped bubbles. Continued abiotic gypsum precipitation transitioned the abiotic crystallites into enlarged needle-form crystallites distributed as parallel arrays along curvilinear growth surface laminae. Suf fi cient rigidity on the bubble surfaces precluded implosion-collapse or detachment. Strontium adsorption widely stabilized the acicular crystals, inhibiting complete coalescence as gypsum spar.																				2817-1713				MAR	2024	62	2					225	251		10.3749/2300012	http://dx.doi.org/10.3749/2300012													WOS:001238968500002

Snow Pollution in Lake Baikal Water Area in Nearby Land Areas	WATER RESOURCES												The extent of the effect of technogenic sources in the Baikal Natural Territory on Lake Baikal water area and coastal zone is assessed. Regional pollution from sources remote from the lake migrates over tens of kilometers in accordance with wind rose and transforms into local in the water protection zone of Lake Baikal. Snow pollution in lake water area has been recorded near the coastal populated localities Listvyanka, Kultuk, Baikal'sk, Slyudyanka, Ust'-Barguzin, Severobaikal'sk, Nizhneangarsk, and at Selenga R. mouth and found to have a local character. The southern depression ranks first in terms of the input of NO2, NO3, NH4, PO4, F, Al, Na, Ba, Mo, Mn, Pb, Cu, Zn, Sr, Hg, and oil products onto lake water area through the atmosphere. However, larger amounts of SO4, H2CO3, Cl, Ca, Mg, and K falls onto the northern depression, and more Be, V, Cr, and Co falls onto the middle part, because of the operation of coastal enterprises, boilerhouses, TPPs, stove heating, motor-car emissions, and natural transport of dust in low-snow areas. Data on the past 15 years show the pollution to drop by half in the late 1990s and early 2000s because of industrial decline. However, a small increase in regional pollution by individual components could be seen in the recent 5 years.

J	Martin, AJ; Pedersen, TF				Martin, AJ; Pedersen, TF			Alteration to lake trophic status as a means to control arsenic mobility in a mine-impacted lake	WATER RESEARCH												The relationship between lake trophic status, sedimentary redox conditions and As mobility was examined in mine-impacted Balmer Lake, Canada. Under the current redox regime, the reductive dissolution of As-bearing Fe(III) oxyhydroxides occurs in close proximity to the sediment-water interface, resulting in the remobilization of dissolved As in the shallow porewaters to values as high as 8.5 mg L-1. The shallow depth of the oxic zone limits the extent to which As can be re-sorbed in the interfacial horizons, and as a result, a proportion of the remobilized As escapes into the water column where it poses a water quality concern. Examination of the relationship between summer average chlorophyll a and total P at spring overturn in the lake water column demonstrates that Balmer Lake is currently eutrophic as a result of mining-derived inputs of P (domestic waters) and N (blasting residues and cyanide breakdown products). The results suggest that actively pushing the system towards oligotrophy by reducing non-natural P loadings to the system will decrease rates of in situ production and associated sediment oxygen demand, which will in turn result in increased thickness of the aerobic zone and enhanced As scavenging. Such conclusions are supported by porewater data which indicate that the flux of As to the water column is significantly reduced when the Fe(III) redox cline is situated at deeper sediment depths, In the absence of detailed P-loading data, it is recommended that P inputs be reduced to similar to10% of the estimated pre-mining P loading of similar to200 kg yr(-1). This implies reducing the collective P-loadings from the two mine sites adjacent to the lake from the approximate current value (similar to150 kg yr(-1)) to similar to20 kg yr(-1). It is proposed that establishment of oligotrophy in the lake should significantly mitigate the current level of dissolved As in lake waters. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Water samples were collected from Lake Vistonis, four major rivers and various small streams and agriculture drainage canals. The concentration of 302 compounds was determined after solid-phase extraction of the water samples and subsequent LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS analysis of the extracts. Overall, herbicides were the most frequently detected pesticides (57%), followed by insecticides (28%) and fungicides (14%). In Lake Vistonis 11 pesticides were detected. Specifically, fluometuron was detected in the 75% of the samples (maximum concentration 0.088 mu g/L) whereas lambdacyhalothrin was detected in all the samples of spring 2011 and alphamethrin in all the samples of spring 2012 (maximum concentration 0.041 and 0.168 mu g/L, respectively). In the rivers and drainage canals 68 pesticides were detected. Specifically, fluometuron was detected in the 53% of the samples (maximum concentration 317.6 mu g/L) followed by chlorpyrifos and prometryn (16 and 13% of the samples respectively). An environmental risk assessment was performed by employing the Risk Quotient (RQ) method. The risk assessment revealed that at least one pesticide concentration led to a RQ N 1 in 20% of the samples. In Lake Vistonis, alphamethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin concentrations resulted in RQ N 1, whereas in the other water bodies this was mainly the result of chlorpyrifos-methyl and alphamethrin exposure. In contrast, herbicide and fungicide concentrations contributed substantially less to environmental risks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Zhang, YW; Xu, BQ; Xu, WL; Hou, M				Zhang, Yuwei; Xu, Baiqing; Xu, Wanlong; Hou, Mei			New insight into pattern divergence of the Indian summer monsoon during the Holocene	HOLOCENE												As one of the paramount components of Asian monsoon and global atmospheric circulation system, the ISM (Indian summer monsoon) plays a vitally important role in the natural environment, ecological balance, and cultural development. Moreover, understanding the ISM could provide valuable insights into global hydrological, atmospheric, and carbon cycles. In recent decades, many ISM records based on different archives have been established within the Holocene, however, issues still remain: the TP (Tibetan Plateau) and the Indian subcontinent are often analyzed separately, despite the both are strongly influenced by the ISM, impeding comprehensive understanding of the monsoon and its object relationship with the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). Here, covering the both regions, 65 published paleoclimate records within the Holocene have been collected, and conclusions are drawn as follow: (I) There are two evolution patterns of the ISM during the Holocene. The first pattern with the Holocene Optimum (HO) at similar to 10-6 ka BP, mainly distributing in the Arabian Sea and its surrounding areas, the Indian subcontinent, western central TP, northern TP, and southern China. The second pattern with the HO at similar to 8-3 ka BP, mainly distributing in the Bay of Bengal and its surrounding areas and southern TP. (2) The delay between the optimum of the second pattern and insolation maximum may be caused by the variation of high-latitude ice cover, although the underlying mechanism concerning the spatial distribution of the two patterns is still unclear. (3) The ISM and the EASM evolve synchronously, and share similar pattern divergence. Arguments over this issue mainly owe to the selected records originating from different patterns. This study makes up the gap in the pattern divergence of monsoon evolution, deepening the understanding of the ISM, even entire Asian monsoon system, and therefore is of great significance for future climate prediction.

The total body length of sampled fish ranged from 248 to 440 mm, while the body weight ranged from 139 to 889 g. Five age classes (from 4+ to 8+) were present in the sample, with predominance of individuals aged 6+. Back-calculated annual length growth was the highest in the first year of life. The total body length defined according to the parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth curve could be calculated at any given time t using 75.07 x (1-e(-0.06x(t+1.73))), and the length-weight relationship - using LogW = 0.010 + 3.02 x logTL. The asymptotic standard body length was SL infinity = 63.86 cm and the phi-prime growth performance index was phi'= 2.53. The highest mean values of Fulton's condition factor were observed in spring of 2016, followed by spring of 2017, and in individuals aged 7+. The seasonal and age-related differences in condition were statistically significant. The lack of data, the degree of endangerment in some European countries, the status of important species for the river continuity restoration and commercial exploitation of this species, emphasise the need for future research.																			0324-0770					JUN	2021	73	2					261	267																WOS:000671548400013

These midden floras show considerable stability throughout the Holocene, with slightly more mesophytic plant assemblages in the middle Holocene. Unlike the southwestern United States, rodent middens of mid-Holocene age are common. In the Arequipa area, the midden record does not reflect any effects of a mid-Holocene mega drought proposed from the extreme lowstand (100 in below modern levels, > 6000 to 3500 yr B.P.) of Lake Titicaca, only 200 km east of Arequipa. This is perhaps not surprising, given other evidence for wetter summers on the Pacific slope of the Andes during the middle Holocene as well as the poor correlation of summer rainfall among modern weather stations in the central Andes-Atacama Desert. The apparent difference in paleoclimatic reconstructions suggests that it is premature to relate changes observed during the Holocene to changes in El Nino Southern Oscillation modes.

Systematic studies of geoheritage have been conducted in the district through some general phases including of inventory, characterization, classification, assessment, and evaluation in some potential geoheritage resources such as Gunung Reng (mogote hill), Jeli Hot Spring, Pergau Lake (dam), gold deposits in Kampung Kalai, Lata Janggut (cascade), Sungai Rual (river), Lata Renyok (waterfall), Lata Chenai (cascade), and Setir Cave complex. Detailed characterization and classification showed that potential geoheritage resources in Jeli district are based on landform/landscape features (geomorphological sites), such as river, waterfall, cascades, limestone hills and caves (speleological sites), and lake, and their distinctive rocks (petrological sites). Other features are the hot spring (hydrogeological site), the gold deposits (mineralogical site), and important structural features (structural sites). These geological sites range between small to medium scales. For the assessment, these resources have some geoheritage values such as scientific, educational, aesthetic, recreational, cultural, economic, and functional values, with the local to state levels of significance. Geoheritage evaluation was conducted in this area to determine the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of its potential geoheritage resources as well as to propose some types of geoheritage conservation such as geosite and geomorphosite. All these sites should be conserved and developed, not only for research and education but also to support geotourism development in the state of Kelantan.

There are hot springs and craters beneath Lake Qiezishan, which lies at 24 degrees 32'33" north latitude and 98 degrees 47'44" east longitude. Using the acoustic method, the temperature fields are recovered with the computed tomography of the measured time-of-flight data. Regarding the measuring system, hydrophones are used as transmitters and receivers. The signal correlation analysis is performed to obtain accurate acoustic wave transit time from the transmitted and received acoustic signals. Both the transmitter emission start time and the receiver capture start time are also estimated using a novel algorithm based on the time-of-flight measurements at different water temperature. The reconstruction of the 2-D temperature field which is an ill-posed problem, is conducted by total least-squares method. The reconstructed temperature distributions are rather approximations to the actual distributions measured with thermocouples. The preliminary results show that the potential of underwater acoustic imaging will be useful for the in situ monitoring of temperature distributions around sea-floor hydrothermal vents.

J	Jonas, JL; Kraft, CE; Margenau, TL				Jonas, JL; Kraft, CE; Margenau, TL			Assessment of seasonal changes in energy density and condition in age-0 and age-1 muskellunge	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The objectives of this study were to evaluate seasonal changes in the energy density of age-0 and age-1 muskellunge Esox masquinongy and to compare energy density to various estimates of condition. Three treatment groups of muskellunge were evaluated to determine temporal changes in energy density (J/g wet weight [ww]), water content, condition factor (K-TL; K = W/L(3), where W = weight and L = total length in centimeters), and relative weight (W-r; ratio of actual to ''standard'' weight) through the first year following hatching. Treatment groups were (1) hatchery (muskellunge reared and maintained in hatchery ponds), (2) stocked (hatchery-reared muskellunge stocked in lakes), and (3) natural (muskellunge naturally produced in lakes). Energy levels and relative condition were compared for fish 3 and 11 months old. Differences in energy density were observed between all three treatment groups. An average overwinter reduction of 494 +/- 192 J/g WW in energy density was observed over all treatment groups combined. Natural fish lost less energy (8%) over winter than either hatchery (12%) or stocked fish (15%). A simple linear model effectively relates energy to indices of condition for muskellunge. A weak positive relation (P < 0.0001, r(2) = 0.39, 0.40, and 0.43) was observed between dry weight energy density and three indicators of fish condition (percent water, K, and W-r). Our results show that condition indices may not be the best indicators of seasonal fluctuations in total energy within and between fish populations. Seasonal fluctuations in energetic values for a population can be more accurately determined through assessment of percent water in individual fish.																			0002-8487					MAR	1996	125	2					203	210		10.1577/1548-8659(1996)125<0203:AOSCIE>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1996)125<0203:AOSCIE>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1996UA76600005

Thus, irrigation with the goal of increasing water use efficiency and the productivity of rainfed agriculture is vital to address climate effects, water scarcity, and food security. This study is aimed at assessing the sustainability of winter wheat production under climate change, and irrigation as an adaptation measure to improve yield, crop water productivity (CWP), and irrigation water productivity (IWP) in the CRV of Ethiopia. AquaCrop is applied to evaluate the effects of climate change and simulate irrigation as an adaptation measure. The analysis covers the baseline (1981-2020) and future (2026-2095) periods with each period categorized into three rainfall years (wet, normal, and dry). The future period is described using two representatives' concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and PCP8.5) scenarios. The results under rainfed and future climate conditions show that the winter wheat yield and CWP are projected to be lowered as compared to the baseline period. Most importantly, a significant reduction in wheat yield and CWP is noticed during the dry years (-60% and -80%) compared to the wet years (-30% and -51%) and normal years (-18% and -30%), respectively. As compared to rainfed agriculture, irrigation significantly reduces the risk of wheat yield decline and improves the CWP. Irrigation is also able to improve the CWP of rainfed wheat production ranging from 0.98-1.4 kg/m(3) to 1.48-1.56 kg/m(3). A projected CWP improvement of 1.1-1.32 kg/m(3) under irrigation is possible from 0.87-1.1 kg/m(3) under rainfed conditions. The study concludes that optimizing irrigation as a climate-change-adapting strategy in the CRV has a more pronounced positive impact to the rainfed production system, especially for the dry and normal years.

Here we explore how the NAO and other atmospheric circulation modes operated over the longer timescales of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and Little Ice Age (LIA). High-resolution palaeolimnological evidence from opposite ends of the Mediterranean basin, supplemented by other palaeoclimate data, is used to track shifts in regional hydro-climatic conditions. Multiple geochemical, sedimentological, isotopic and palaeoecological proxies from Estanya and Montcortes lakes in northeast Spain and Nar lake in central Turkey have been cross-correlated at decadal time intervals since AD 900. These dryland lakes capture sensitively changes in precipitation/evaporation (PIE) balance by adjustments in water level and salinity, and are especially valuable for reconstructing variability over decadal-centennial timescales. Iberian lakes show lower water levels and higher salinities during the 11th to 13th centuries synchronous with the MCA and generally more humid conditions during the 'LIA' (15th-19th centuries). This pattern is also clearly evident in tree-ring records from Morocco and from marine cores in the western Mediterranean Sea. In the eastern Mediterranean, palaeoclimatic records from Turkey. Greece and the Levant show generally drier hydro-climatic conditions during the LIA and a wetter phase during the MCA. This implies that a bipolar climate see-saw has operated in the Mediterranean for the last 1100 years. However, while western Mediterranean aridity appears consistent with persistent positive NAO state during the MCA. the pattern is less clear in the eastern Mediterranean. Here the strongest evidence for higher winter season precipitation during the MCA comes from central Turkey in the northeastern sector of the Mediterranean basin. This in turn implies that the LIA/MCA hydro-climatic pattern in the Mediterranean was determined by a combination of different climate modes along with major physical geographical controls, and not by NAO forcing alone, or that the character of the NAO and its teleconnections have been non-stationary.

Here, we present a detailed early to mid-Holocene record of environmental changes in the Turtul hanging spring-fed fen, northeastern Poland, to test whether the well preserved and accurately subsampled alternating peat and tufa sediments allow us to recognise short-duration local and regional climatic changes. Our reconstructions are based on a loss-on-ignition analysis of the sediment, carbon and oxygen stable isotope values of tufa, and biotic proxies: plant macrofossil and malacological analyses. A detailed environmental reconstruction was possible due to the combination of detailed sampling (1 cm intervals) and high sediment accumulation rates. The two sediment sequences collected from the fen revealed the congruent palaeoenvironmental history; however, the temporal shift associated with the distance of the coring site from the water outflow was also apparent, stressing the need for careful selection of the coring site in palaeoenvironmental research. Peat deposition at Turtul started at 10,300 cal yr BP; however, tufa precipitation did not begin before 9250 cal yr BP. During the most active tufa deposition, from 7850 to 6100 cal yr BP, a high sedimentation rate was observed (0.11-0.25 cm yr(-1)). We found several abrupt and short-duration declines in carbonate deposition corresponding to climatic fluctuations recorded in geological archives from the southeastern Baltic region. The carbonate drops at 8200-8130, 7900-7850, 7400-7300, 6600-6500, 5980-5870 and 5400 cal yr BP were associated with climate cooling or drying, whereas those at 10,200-9250, 8450-8340 and 6160-6100 cal yr BP can be attributed to drying with no cooling. We conclude that the evident sensitivity of the Turtul fen to climatic shifts that emerge from our high-resolution (one sample every 17 years on average) reconstruction complements the still rare high-resolution palaeoenvironmental records in the area.					; Gałka, Mariusz/ABB-1744-2020; Apolinarska, Karina/AAZ-3588-2020	Galka, Mariusz/0000-0001-8906-944X; Apolinarska, Karina/0000-0002-3507-5139; Kielczewski, Rafal/0000-0003-4900-3846; Pleskot, Krzysztof/0000-0002-3724-1700; Marzec, Magdalena/0000-0002-8366-6099													0959-6836	1477-0911				AUG	2022	32	8					764	779	09596836221095975	10.1177/09596836221095975	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836221095975		MAY 2022											WOS:000799816000001

To examine this, the interactions between temperature, photoperiod and light exposure (LE) (integral daily light supply) on specific growth rates were analysed for Limnothrix redekei, Planktothrix agardhii (cyanobacteria), Nitzschia acicularis and Stephanodiscus minutulus (diatoms). A model of factor interactions was developed based on new (P. agardhii and St. minutulus) and previously published laboratory studies. It describes the measured data with high precision. Temperature and photoperiod affect the parameters of the light-growth response curve differently, but these effects are the same for all species. The link between functions for temperature and photoperiod is more species-specific. Using meteorological data, the model developed here was used to study the interplay of these factors during a spring bloom in Lake Muggelsee (Berlin). It was found that while all three factors influenced phytoplankton growth, temperature and photoperiod were more important than LE. Both the intensities of the factors and the interactions between them influenced each species to a different degree. The results may help improve our understanding and ability to predict shifts in phytoplankton communities caused by weather patterns and climate change.

One consequence has involved the degradation of lake water environments. Lake surface water temperatures (LSWTs) significantly shape water ecological environments and are highly correlated with the watershed ecosystem features and biodiversity levels. Analysing and predicting spatiotemporal changes in LSWT and exploring the corresponding impacts on water quality is essential for controlling and improving the ecological water environment of watersheds. In this study, Dianchi Lake was examined through an analysis of 54 water quality indicators from 10 water quality monitoring sites from 2005 to 2016. Support vector regression (SVR), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Back Propagation Artificial Neural Network (BPANN) methods were applied to form a hybrid forecasting model. A geospatial analysis was conducted to observe historical LSWTs and water quality changes for Dianchi Lake from 2005 to 2016. Based on the constructed model, LSWTs and changes in water quality were simulated for 2017 to 2020. The relationship between LSWTs and water quality thresholds was studied. The results show limited errors and highly generalized levels of predictive performance. In addition, a spatial visualization analysis shows that from 2005 to 2020, the chlorophyll-a (Chia), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total nitrogen (TN) diffused from north to south and that ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and total phosphorus (TP) levels are increases in the northern part of Dianchi Lake, where the LSWT levels exceed 17 degrees C. The LSWT threshold is 17.6-18.53 degrees C, which falls within the threshold for nutritional water quality, but COD and TN levels fall below V dass water quality standards. Transparency (Trans), COD, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and Chla levels present a close relationship with LSWT, and LSWTs are found to fundamentally affect lake cyanobacterial blooms.

Can hot temperatures limit disease transmission? A test of mechanisms in a zooplankton-fungus system	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												Thermal ecology theory predicts that transmission of infectious diseases should respond unimodally to temperature, that is be maximized at intermediate temperatures and constrained at extreme low and high temperatures. However, empirical evidence linking hot temperatures to decreased transmission in nature remains limited. We tested the hypothesis that hot temperatures constrain transmission in a zooplankton-fungus (Daphnia dentifera-Metschnikowia bicuspidata) disease system where autumnal epidemics typically start after lakes cool from their peak summer temperatures. This pattern suggested that maximally hot summer temperatures could be inhibiting disease spread. Using a series of laboratory experiments, we examined the effects of high temperatures on five mechanistic components of transmission. We found that (a) high temperatures increased exposure to parasites by speeding up foraging rate but (b) did not alter infection success post-exposure. (c) High temperatures lowered parasite production (due to faster host death and an inferred delay in parasite growth). (d) Parasites made in hot conditions were less infectious to the next host (instilling a parasite 'rearing' or 'trans-host' effect of temperature during the prior infection). (e) High temperatures in the free-living stage also reduce parasite infectivity, either by killing or harming parasites. We then assembled the five mechanisms into an index of disease spread. The resulting unimodal thermal response was most strongly driven by the rearing effect. Transmission peaked at intermediate hot temperatures (25-26 degrees C) and then decreased at maximally hot temperatures (30-32 degrees C). However, transmission at these maximally hot temperatures only trended slightly lower than the baseline control (20 degrees C), which easily sustains epidemics in laboratory conditions and in nature. Overall, we conclude that while exposure to hot epilimnetic temperatures does somewhat constrain disease, we lack evidence that this effect fully explains the lack of summer epidemics in this natural system. This work demonstrates the importance of experimentally testing hypothesized mechanisms of thermal constraints on disease transmission. Furthermore, it cautions against drawing conclusions based on field patterns and theory alone. A plain language summary is available for this article.

The Pere David's deer (Elaphurus davidianus) population was established from only a small number of individuals. Their genetic diversity is therefore relatively low and transmissible (parasitic) diseases affecting them merit further attention. Parasitic infections can affect the health, survival, and population development of the host. However, few reports have been published on the gastrointestinal parasites of Pere David's deer. The aims of this study were: (1) to identify the intestinal parasites groups in Pere David's deer; (2) to determine their prevalence and burden and clarify the effects of different seasons and regions on various indicators of Pere David's deer intestinal parasites; (3) to evaluate the effects of the Pere David's deer reproductive period on these parasites; (4) to reveal the regularity of the parasites in space and time. Methods. In total, 1,345 Pere David's deer faecal samples from four regions during four seasons were tested using the flotation (saturated sodium nitrate solution) to identify parasites of different genus or group, and the McMaster technique to count the number of eggs or oocysts. Results. Four groups of gastrointestinal parasites were found, of which strongyles were dominant; their prevalence and burden were significantly higher than other groups. Significant temporal and spatial effects on gastrointestinal parasitic infection were found. Parasite diversity, prevalence, parasite burden, and aggregation were the highest in summer. Among the four regions, parasite diversity, prevalence, and burden were the highest in the Dongting Lake area. In addition, parasite diversity and burden during the reproductive period of Pere David's deer was significantly higher than during the post-reproductive period. Conclusions. The summer season and the reproductive period of Pere David's deer had great potential for parasite transmission, and there is a high risk of parasite outbreaks in the Dongting Lake area.

Stratification of microbiomes during the holomictic period of Lake Fuxian, an alpine monomictic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												In warm monomictic lakes, the hypolimnion is important for accumulating and decomposing organic matter derived from surface production, and the regenerated nutrients will be supplied to the epilimnion through winter vertical mixing. So far, we know little about microbial community composition and function in the hypolimnion when the significant thermal stratification disappears. In this study, we investigated microbial community compositions and functional gene contents by means of metagenomics along a depth profile in the warm monomictic alpine Lake Fuxian during holomictic period. Overall, bacteria were the dominant microbial group at different water depths, while phages had their high relative abundance in the epilimnion. We observed slight thermal but strong chemical stratification even during this typical winter overturn. The anaerobic respiration with nitrate and sulfate as the terminal electron acceptors was accumulated at bottom of hypolimnionin as indicated through metabolic pathway reconstruction. We were able to get 440 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and unraveled a high genomic diversity of freshwater pelagic microbiomes along this depth profile. We furthermore defined a new class of "Plancto_FXH1" of Planctomycetes from these MAGs, of which a distinct nitrate reduction operon was identified. Representatives of this phylum mainly thrive in the hypolimnion as previously suspected, but few lineages were detected in the epilimnion. In summary, metagenomics enabled us to find a new group of Planctomycetes, probably involved in denitrification in the hypolimnion in Lake Fuxian, which expand our knowledge on denitrifying bacterial diversity and their denitrification potential in deep freshwater lakes.					; li, huabing2001/B-7026-2012; xing, peng/HDM-6843-2022; Li, Biao/KYR-3506-2024; Wu, Qinglong/B-7625-2011	Xing, Peng/0000-0002-4917-5181; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2020	65			1	SI		S134	S148		10.1002/lno.11346	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11346		OCT 2019											WOS:000493036500001

The n-alkane distribution suggests that Lake Xiaolongwan has undergone a shift from an oligotrophic state with low algal production and little emergent/submerged macrophytes in the early Holocene, to a eutrophic state with high algal production and abundant emergent/submerged macrophytes since the middle Holocene. The pattern of variation observed in the biomarker proxies ACL (the n-alkane average chain length), Paq (aquatic macrophyte versus aquatic macrophyte and terrestrial plant ratio), and LPTP (lake productivity/ terrigenous organic production) is throughout the record similar to that of the total organic carbon. The variation of compound-specific carbon isotopic values in the middle- and short-chain alkanes was mainly regulated by lake productivity and the accumulating organic pool through time. In this forested region, where the vegetation is dominated by C-3 plants, the long-chain n-alkanes (C-27-C-31) are predominantly derived from leaf wax lipids. The compound-specific delta C-13(27-31) value is sensitive to effective precipitation, and therefore represents a useful indicator of regional monsoonal precipitation. Spectral analysis on the delta C-13(27-31) time series reveals significant periodicities of 87-89, 205-212, 1020-1050 and 1750-2041 years. On the centennial timescale, the quasi-periodicities around 88 and 210 years suggest a strong link between solar activity and monsoon rainfall. The millennial monsoon cycle in northeastern China is associated with sea surface temperature (SST) variations in two active centers of the summer monsoon, the western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) and the Okhotsk High. Increasing SST in the subtropical sea may cause a northwards shift of the WPSH, which extends the monsoon rain band (Meiyu) to northeastern China, and thus increasing rainfall in that region. Meanwhile, decreasing SST in the Okhotsk Sea may strengthen the Okhotsk high, bringing more moisture into northeastern China. We suggest that the Pacific Ocean is a main regulator for summer monsoon rainfall in northeastern China at present and at different time scales during the Holocene. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Yulong region, southeastern Tibetan Plateau	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Microparticles deposited in snow and ice of glaciers are critical indicators of high-altitude atmospheric environmental conditions. However, limited research on microparticle transport, deposition and cycling in diverse environmental samples hinders a comprehensive understanding of their roles in climate change. This study examines spatiotemporal characteristics of microparticles in glacier, precipitation, meltwater, river water and lake water samples from the Yulong Snow Mountain (Mt. Yulong) region between 2013 and 2015. Results revealed that precipitation samples from Longpan Town exhibited the highest microparticle number concentrations, while samples from Ganhaizi and Lijiang City had the lowest concentrations. Microparticles in precipitation exhibited distinct diurnal variation, i.e. with daytime concentrations higher than nighttime concentrations, primarily driven by local/regional human activities. In surface fresh snow, microparticle concentrations increased significantly with elevation. Snow pit samples showed a peak microparticle concentration layer, suggesting a consistent wet deposition of atmospheric dust during the winter or early spring. Post-depositional processes and leaching likely play significant roles in the redistribution of microparticles within the snowpack. The volume-size distribution of microparticles in various forms of water samples presents unimodal and bimodal patterns, indicating the atmospheric environment in Mt. Yulong region is affected by long-range transport of mineral dust and local human activities. Microparticle concentrations varied across water types, with glacier ice meltwater having the highest concentrations, followed by snow meltwater, while precipitation and snow pit samples exhibited lower concentrations. Our findings suggest that microparticles undergo a series of complex depositional and transport processes in the cryosphere system, contributing to their diverse variabilities in different environmental media. This study highlights the need for further investigation into the microparticles in glaciers and various waters bodies to better understand their dynamics and climatic implications within the cryosphere.					junming, guo/JZC-7672-2024; Kang, Shichang/I-6830-2018; SAJJAD, WASIM/B-5677-2019; Niu, Hewen/AHC-3884-2022	Kang, Shichang/0000-0003-2115-9005; 													0013-9351	1096-0953				NOV 15	2025	285		2						122394	10.1016/j.envres.2025.122394	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2025.122394								40684978					WOS:001543418100003

Palaeoflood activity and climate change over the last 1400 years recorded by lake sediments in the north-west European Alps	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												A high-resolution sedimentological and geochemical study of a high-altitude proglacial lake (Lake Blanc, Aiguilles Rouges, 2352m a.s.l.) revealed 195 turbidites, 190 of which are related to flood events over the last 1400 years. We used the coarsest sediment fraction of each turbidite as a proxy for the intensity of each flood event. Because most flood events at this locality are triggered by localized summer convective precipitation events, the reconstructed sedimentary record reveals changes in the frequency and intensity of such events over the last millennium. Comparisons with other temperature, palaeohydrological and glacier reconstructions in the region suggest that the most intense events occurred during the warmest periods, i.e. during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (AD 8001300) and the current period of global warming. On a multi-decadal time scale, almost all the flood frequency peaks seem to correspond to warmer periods, whereas multi-centennial variations in flood frequency appear to follow the regional precipitation pattern. Consequently, this new Alpine flood record provides further evidence of a link between climate warming and an increase in the frequency and intensity of flooding on a multi-decadal time scale, whereas the centennial variability in flood frequencies is related to regional precipitation patterns.

Combining microscopic analysis with genetic studies enables the identification of biomass, and when paired with the growing field of deep machine learning, these methods could swiftly detect changes in particulate matter and microbial composition, particularly in the context of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats. Conducting such analyses on a large scale holds significant potential for creating a unique database, enabling the comparison of airborne biomass and accelerating the detection of anomalies, such as the intentional or unintentional release of bacteria into the environment.Abstract This study examines the differences in particulate matter (PM) properties and microbial compositions between natural and urban environments, providing foundational data for environmental monitoring and biothreat detection. Air samples were collected during the spring and early summer from two distinct locations: a forest/lake area, and an urban parking lot adjacent to a high-traffic roadway. Quantitative phase imaging microscopy and genomic sequencing were employed to characterize particle size distributions, statistical properties, and microbial community structures in these environments. The results revealed significant differences in PM properties between the two locations. Urban air exhibited higher particle concentrations that reflect pollution sources, whereas the natural environment displayed greater variability in particle size and distribution, correlating with diverse biological content. Genomic sequencing showed a lower diversity of microbial communities compared to the forest/lake area but with greater uniformity. To sum up, by integrating optical microscopy and genomic sequencing, this research demonstrates the feasibility of establishing environmental baselines for PM characteristics and bio-component diversity. The findings underscore the potential of combining real-time optical sensing with genomic tools for early biothreat detection and improved environmental monitoring in diverse settings.

J	LAMB, HF				LAMB, HF			PALYNOLOGICAL EVIDENCE FOR POSTGLACIAL CHANGE IN THE POSITION OF TREE LIMIT IN LABRADOR	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												The postglacial history of the forest-tundra zone in Labrador is inferred from the pollen stratigraphy of sediment cores from 4 lakes which differ considerably in the size and relative relief of their hydrologic catchments. Local pollen-assemblage zones are established independently for each pollen sequence by numerical methods. The relative pollen stratigraphies, interpreted through multivariate statistical comparison with modern pollen spectra from the region, show an overall increase in the tundra component of the forest-tundra vegetation since .apprxeq. 3000 BP. Decreasing absolute frequencies of Picea pollen in the sediments are interpreted as evidence of the decline in tree numbers within the lake catchments, and therefore as a potential record of lowering of the altitudinal tree limit. The records show diachronous changes between sites because of differences in catchment elevation and relief. Tree limit has apparently fallen at least 40 m between 3000 and 1000 BP. A further fall of 30 m may have taken place by 250 BP. High ground in northern Labrador makes it unlikely that any equivalent southward displacement of latitudinal tree line can be identified.																			0012-9615	1557-7015					1985	55	2					241	258		10.2307/1942559	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1942559													WOS:A1985AJF3600005

Following initial impoundment behind Sanford Dam in the early 1960s, local residents observed the first of multiple uncontrolled lake draining events that would occur during the dam's nearly 60 years of service. During Hurricane Florence in September 2018, Sanford Dam breached due to overtopping. The City elected to reconstruct, which afforded an opportunity to evaluate the dam and its foundation. A review of historical records and the performance of additional subsurface investigations revealed conditions which present a risk to the dam's safety. This paper will include a review of historical accounts of unexpected losses of the lake, a summary of the local geology and subsurface conditions revealed during subsurface investigations, an explanation of the failure mode considered most critical to the dam, and a description of the measures designed to address the threat posed by the site conditions.																			0895-0563		978-0-7844-8403-6				2022	333						260	271																WOS:000775850000027
J	Middleton, GV				Middleton, GV			J.W. Spencer (1851-1921): his life in Canada, and his work on Preglacial River Valleys	GEOSCIENCE CANADA												J.W. Spencer, born and buried in Dundas, Ontario, was a pioneer Canadian geomorphologist. After attending school in Dundas, he moved to Hamilton where he worked in a pharmacy, and was encouraged by local amateur geologists. He attended McGill University from 1871 to 1874, studied under William Dawson and Bernard Harrington, and graduated in the newly reorganized Applied Sciences program. He spent the summer of 1874 working as Robert Bell's assistant in Manitoba, and the following summer working in the Michigan copper mines as an assistant to a mine engineer, Luther Emerson. He obtained a position as science teacher at Hamilton Collegiate Institute (Fig. 1) in 1876. In 1877 he submitted his thesis on Michigan copper deposits to the university at Gottingen, Germany and that summer he visited the university, passed his oral examinations and was awarded the Ph.D., becoming the second Canadian to earn a doctorate in geology. In 1880 he became Professor at King's College, Windsor, Nova Scotia. He concentrated his geological studies on the region around his birthplace at the head of Lake Ontario: at first mainly Paleozoic geology and paleontology, but by 1880 he had switched decisively to surficial geology, particularly the preglacial drainage of Lakes Erie and Ontario. In 1880 he travelled extensively in the United States and attended the AAAS meeting in Boston, where he met J.P. Lesley, who encouraged him to continue his studies of preglacial rivers. In 1882 he accepted a position as Professor and Director of the Museum of Natural History at the University of Missouri.																			0315-0941					JUN	2004	31	2					49	56																WOS:000222746000001

The records reveal variations in vegetation, fire and climate history since 18 500 cal a BP. The results show that seven significant vegetation changes are recorded, which are responses to climate changes and/or fire events. Frequent and intensive fires occurred during the periods 17 900-15 000, 13 000-11 500 and 4280-980 cal a BP, corresponding to relatively dry climatic conditions. Combined with the climatic record from Tiancai Lake, the regional climatic changes since 18 500 cal a BP in western Yunnan Province are reconstructed. Namely, the Heinrich Event 1, the Bolling-Allerod warm period and the Younger Dryas event during the last deglaciation are ubiquitous in western Yunnan Province. The start of the Holocene is recorded at 11 500 cal a BP. The Holocene climatic optimum occurred between 8450 and 4280 cal a BP. After 4280 cal a BP, the climate deteriorated, accompanied by evidence for human impact. Based on this study, we consider that vegetation and climatic changes since 18 500 cal a BP in south-western Yunnan Province are primarily driven by September and average summer solar insolation, with some associated influence from regional sea-surface temperature and sea-level rise.

Relationships among round gobies, Dreissena mussels, and benthic algae in the south nearshore of Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) populations are established in all the Great Lakes, subsequent to the success of the Dreissena mussel invasion. Additionally, localized resurgence of the nuisance alga, Cladophora glomerata, also has been reported across several of the Great Lakes post-Dreissena. We examined the relationship among round goby size and population density and Dreissena mussel metrics and Cladophora biomass in three regions of the nearshore environment of U.S. waters of Lake Ontario during summer 2008. We also estimated the size of the round goby population in these regions. Correlations between round goby population metrics and Dreissena mussel metrics suggest a low potential for lakewide control of mussel populations by round gobies. In August but not June, fish density was positively correlated with Dreissena density, biomass, and size, suggesting round gobies did not depress mussel numbers, but may selectively remove some smaller mussel size classes. Round goby length was positively correlated with Cladophora biomass, which probably is best explained as a sampling artifact. Seasonal changes in the round goby population density with depth were suggestive of an offshore migration in late summer. Fish were generally smaller but equally abundant, moving west-to-east along the nearshore environment of the lake. We estimated that the nearshore population size of round gobies was 0.7 billion fish, equivalent to 2.2 fish/m(2). This translated into approximately 1287 tonnes of round gobies or about 40 kg/ha. Coupled with the broad diet selection of this invasive fish, results suggest that round gobies will have a substantial impact on the structure of the nearshore benthic community.

Lakes in the middle and lower Yangtze River floodplains are irreplaceable wintering grounds for waterbirds on the East Asia - Australasian Flyway. However, more and more lakes in this region have become isolated from the main channel of the Yangtze River and the hydrological connectivity between these lakes and the Yangtze River is deteriorating. This study aims to verify whether herbivorous waterbirds abundance is associated with lake connectivity using synchronous survey data in 23 lakes for the period of 2004-2015. The habitat diversity index, the irreplaceability index and waterbird density were used to evaluate the impact of lake connectivity on herbivorous waterbirds distribution. Our results showed that herbivorous waterbirds distribution was restricted to several better connected lakes although the total numbers of herbivorous waterbird in this region increased over this period. The irreplaceability index of herbivorous waterbirds in connected lakes was significantly higher than that in medium-to-highly isolated lakes. The density of herbivorous waterbirds was lower in highly isolated lakes; but there was an increasing gradient towards the well-connected lakes. Our study demonstrated that hydrological isolation had a significantly negative effect on herbivorous waterbirds.					; Yu, Xiubo/A-5875-2016	Liu, Yu/0000-0002-1692-1811; 													0277-5212	1943-6246				FEB	2017	37	1					79	88		10.1007/s13157-016-0841-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-016-0841-9													WOS:000394134600007

Miocene tectonics and climate in the Lake Mead region recorded by Horse Spring Formation carbonates	MIOCENE TECTONICS OF THE LAKE MEAD REGION, CENTRAL BASIN AND RANGE	Geological Society of America Special Papers											The Oligocene-Miocene Horse Spring Formation consists of sedimentary strata that record the onset and evolution of Miocene extensional tectonics in the Lake Mead region. The sedimentary basins of this formation hold critical clues for evaluating and testing competing models that attempt to explain the tectonic evolution of this important part of the Basin and Range. Detailed sedimentology, stratigraphy, isotope geochemistry, and new geochronology of carbonates of the Horse Spring Formation shed light on the details of middle Miocene depositional systems and provide important paleoclimatic and paleotopographic data that further our understanding of the geological evolution of this area. We investigated four carbonate sections in detail, two from the Bitter Ridge Limestone Member (Slot Canyon section, near the Gale Hills, and the West Longwell section, at the Bitter Ridge), one from the Thumb Member (East Longwell section, near the Bitter Ridge), and one from the Rainbow Gardens Member (Rainbow Gardens Recreation Area section), to understand the evolution of carbonate lake systems, to extricate paleoclimatic from tectonic signals in the sedimentary record, and to develop a more clear picture of the evolution of Horse Spring sedimentary basins. New 40Ar/39Ar dates from the Bitter Ridge Limestone, combined with dates in the published literature, suggest that the Bitter Ridge Lake may have evolved time-transgressively from the White Basin area in the east to the Rainbow Gardens area in the west. Possibly contemporaneous with this evolution, the lake gradually shifted from an open to a closed lake system, most likely due to tectonic partitioning of the basin or the creation of a tectonic sill that cut off the overflow for the lake. Stable isotope and lithofacies analyses provide one of the first detailed proxy records of paleoclimate for the Miocene of the Basin and Range and show strong evidence for an orbitally forced climate signal that represents changes in the precipitation/evaporation ratio for the Bitter Ridge Lake system. Because we can effectively show a climatic signal in the Bitter Ridge Limestone units over 100 k.y. and, likely, 40 k.y. time cycles, longer time-scale shifts in isotopic ratios are more likely due to tectonic processes. Based on a strong negative shift in oxygen isotopic ratios, previous researchers have suggested that the Lake Mead region experienced an increase in paleoelevation during Horse Spring time, while the remainder of the central Basin and Range to the north experienced a decrease in elevation for the same time period. Our data, when compared with data from the Pliocene Hualapai Limestone and those presented by previous researchers, appear to constrain the timing of this isotopic shift to between 15 and 13 Ma, coincident with the timing of the onset of rapid extension in this part of the Basin and Range. We hypothesize that this isotopic shift was due not to a change in paleoelevation due to magmatic activity alone, but was influenced by either (1) longer travel distances of air masses and the development of increased topographic corrugation as the Lake Mead region experienced accelerated rates of extension or (2) drainage reorganization of the early Colorado Plateau and the infusion of isotopically lighter waters from this emergent source.

Analysis of the meristic, morphometric and electrophoretic data indicates no statistical evidence of genetic differnces between basin populations. Significant differences in size and growth data between basin populations occur and are attributed to differences in limnological conditions between basins which affect the time of spawning, length of growing season and growth rate.

Here we present a highresolution ice-core isotopic record from the central Tibetan Plateau (TP), where the climate is sensitive to the meltwater forcing, and explore possible signals of the climate response to potential LIS meltwater discharges in the early to mid-Holocene. The record shows four abrupt large fluctuations during the 7-9 ka BP (kiloannum before present), reflecting large shifts of the mid-latitude westerlies and the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) over this period, and they corresponded to possible LIS freshwater events documented in other paleoclimate records. Our study suggests that multiple rapid meltwater discharge events might have occurred during the final stage of LIS. The finding implies the possibility of rapid sea level rise and unstable climate in the transition zone between the mid-latitude westerlies and the ISM due to fast polar ice retreat under the anthropogenic global warming.

Scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was employed to characterize the elemental composition of salt after dry-evaporating a predetermined volume of each collected sample. The results indicated that the salt concentration in the brines ranged from 0.1% to 41.3%, with the highest concentration found in wells and natural saline springs. The dominant component was sodium chloride, but several sites had high concentrations of potassium chloride, which is essential for human health. Over 95% of the analyzed samples also contained other minerals like calcium and magnesium, further highlighting the health benefits of these brine sources. However, two sites were slightly contaminated with heavy metals, posing potential health risks if consumed. The DRASTIC index, a standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential, gave scores between 99 and 208, indicating moderate to very high intrinsic pollution potential. Similarly, the DRASTIC-LU index, which takes into account and the land use aspects, showed scores ranging from 114 to 258, suggesting low to very high vulnerability to contamination. These findings provide valuable information on the elemental composition of salt and the vulnerability of these brine sources, which are still used by rural communities for traditional practices like meat and fish preservation, milk curdling, and pickling. The study has important implications for sustainable management from both ethnoarchaeological and economic perspectives.

For the same purpose the study was conducted for the samples of water of Sambhar lake city and its adjoining areas. The standard methods of APHA were used to analysis 15 samples collected from hand pumps and tube wells of the specified area. The analytical results show higher concentration of total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity sodium, nitrate, sulfate, and fluoride, which indicate signs of deterioration but values of pH, calcium, magnesium, total hardness, and carbonate are within permissible limits as per WHO standards. From the Hill-piper trilinear diagram, it is observed that the majority of groundwater from sampling stations are sodium-potassium-chloride-sulfate type water. The values of sodium absorption ratio and electrical conductivity of the groundwater were plotted in the US salinity laboratory diagram for irrigation water. Only the one sample fall in C3S1 quality with high salinity hazard and low sodium hazard. Other samples fall in high salinity hazard and high sodium hazard. Chemical analysis of groundwater shows that mean concentration of cation is in order sodium > magnesium > calcium > potassium while for the anion it is chloride > bicarbonate > nitrate > sulfate.																			0167-6369					MAR	2011	174	1-4					547	554		10.1007/s10661-010-1477-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-010-1477-5								20559718					WOS:000286830200041

Depending on the year, 550-700 fields (56% cereals) along roadside transects were observed up to twice daily from mid-August to late October. (2) Over 95% of the cranes observed were on cereal fields. Excluding crops other than cereals, 65% were on awnless hard spring wheat, 21% on soft durum wheat and 11% on barley. Some preference was shown for durum wheat, which comprised 10% of the cereal crops. (3) Cranes tended to use harvested cereal fields in preference to swathed (windrowed) cereal. Use of harvested barley and hard spring wheat (but not durum wheat) fields was directly related to abundance of waste grain. (4) Most foraging occurred within 8 km of roosting sites. (5) Scaring or hunting cranes had no appreciable effect on their use of fields. (6) Cranes were tolerant of a wide range of landscape and crop variables. Where cranes are a potential threat to cereal crops, harvesting the standing crop (foregoing swathing) has the greatest promise for preventing damage.																			0021-8901	1365-2664				APR	1988	25	1					111	124																WOS:A1988M919900009

Ruby			Climate change will reduce North American inland wetland areas and disrupt their seasonal regimes	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Climate change can alter wetland extent and function, but such impacts are perplexing. Here, changes in wetland characteristics over North America from 25 degrees to 53 degrees North are projected under two climate scenarios using a state-of-the-science Earth system model. At the continental scale, annual wetland area decreases by similar to 10% (6%-14%) under the high emission scenario, but spatiotemporal changes vary, reaching up to +/- 50%. As the dominant driver of these changes shifts from precipitation to temperature in the higher emission scenario, wetlands undergo substantial drying during summer season when biotic processes peak. The projected disruptions to wetland seasonality cycles imply further impacts on biodiversity in major wetland habitats of upper Mississippi, Southeast Canada, and the Everglades. Furthermore, wetlands are projected to significantly shrink in cold regions due to the increased infiltration as warmer temperature reduces soil ice. The large dependence of the projections on climate change scenarios underscores the importance of emission mitigation to sustaining wetland ecosystems in the future.

River water entering the reservoir during summer was the main driver defining hypolimnetic oxygen and nutrient concentration. Thus, volume-normalized hypolimnetic oxygen concentration was highly correlated with the river DOC, but not significantly correlated with surrogates of the epilimnetic primary production or with in-lake features. Also, the areal extent of anoxia and nitrate concentration controlled total phosphorus content in the hypolimnion, suggesting that the river DOC and nitrate inputs control internal load of phosphorus. Because improvement of the river water quality was the consequence of implementation of advanced wastewater treatment plants in the reservoir watershed, we advocate these solutions to manage reservoir eutrophication problems. Our results should prompt reservoir limnologists to always take into account the probable, direct effect of allochthonous sources in the hypolimnetic oxygen content and nutrient dynamics, especially in human-impacted systems.

Predicting the effect of climate change on temperate shallow lakes with the ecosystem model PCLake	HYDROBIOLOGIA					5th International Symposium on Shallow Lakes	JUN 05-09, 2005	Dalfsen, NETHERLANDS					Global average surface temperatures are expected to rise by about 1.4-5.8 degrees C from the present until the year 2100. This temperature increase will affect all ecosystems on earth. For shallow lakes-which can be either in a clear water or a turbid state-this climate change will expectedly negatively affect water transparency though the prediction is far from conclusive and experimental investigations elucidating the potential climatic effects on shallow lakes are still rare. The aim of this study was to further shape and sharpens hypotheses on the impact of climate change on shallow lakes by applying an existing and well-calibrated ecosystem model, PCLake. We focused on asymptotic model behaviour for a range of temperature and loading scenarios in a factorial design. We conclude that climate change will likely lead to decreased critical nutrient loadings. Combined with an expected increase in the external nutrient loading, this will increase the probability of a shift from a clear to a turbid state. As the model predicts a higher summer chlorophyll-a concentration, a stronger dominance of cyanobacteria during summer and a reduced zooplankton abundance due to climate change, the turbid state itself is likely to become even more severe.

The impact of seepage influx on cation content of a Central Amazonian floodplain lake	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												We give the first report on seepage dynamics in an Amazonian floodpiain take, by directly quantifying seepage influx, and qualifying its impact on the hydrochemical seasonality of Lake Camaleao, an island channel take, which is subject to the 10 m floodpulse of the lower Solimoes/Amazon River. The take shows a distinct seasonal pattern in cation concentrations, with a rise and maximum during its low-water (isolation) phase. To quantitatively and qualitatively clarify the significance of seepage influx, a series of hydrological and hydrochemical variables was recorded in 1998. The observed seasonal pattern in the content of solute cations was similar to results reported for 1995 [G.E. Weber, Causes of hydrochemical seasonality of major cations in Lago Camaleao, a Central Amazonian floodplain take, Ver. Int. Verein. Limnot. 26 (2) (1997) 408-411.]; when first qualitative evidence for the largely seepage driven process of cation loading was found. Concentration of the monitored Ca, Na, Mg and K, in Lake Camaleao and Solimoes were similar during high water. Solute cation content in the groundwater around Lake Camaleao was up to 20 times higher than in take and river water. With the beginning of falling water, cation concentrations started to rise slightly in Lake Camaleao. Starting with isolation from Solimoes River the content of solute cations in the take rose by approximately 150% within 14 days, then the concentrations had reached their maximum values. This falls in with 14 days of cation rich seepage influx into take Camaleao. Mean seepage influx rate during this period was 1.45 mm/h, which equals a total influx into Lake Camaleao of 9.7 m(3)/min. After 14 days seepage stopped to enter the take, take water began to seep into the sediment, (seepage flux inversion), and the rise in cation concentrations in Lake Camaleao came to an end. Based on the water budget and measured cation concentrations of the contributing water fluxes we predicted cation concentrations at the end of the 14 days period of seepage influx into the isolated Camaleao. Observed and expected cation concentrations are fairly close. The coincidence of seepage influx and the solute cation increase in the isolated Camaleao, observed twice in 1998 and 1995, gives us strong evidence that cation loading by seepage is the main cause for the take's characteristic peak of cation concentration during falling water. Our field measurements correspond to values calculated by [K. Furch, Evaluation of groundwater input as major source of solutes in an Amazon floodpiain take during the low-water period, In: Verh. Int. Verein. Limnot. 27, Stuttgart, Germany, 1999.] considering changes in ion concentrations which also point to groundwater as major ion source for Camaleao Lake at low-water period.

The model uses only daily air temperature, snow depth, and precipitation data. These data are available from a relatively dense network of observing stations, permitting the development of a national climatology of extreme soil freezing levels. A set of adjustment factors is also presented that allows conversion between the mapped base-soil freezing depths and those associated with other soil conditions. Surface cover characteristics of bare soil with and without ambient snow cover and turf are analyzed. The deepest soil freezing levels within the United States are found across the Dakotas, where persistent subfreezing winter temperatures, and relatively little soil moisture and snow cover combine to maximize soil freezing. Ample winter snow cover mitigates soil freezing extremes in the Great Lakes, northern New England, and western mountains. Soil freezing is unlikely south of northern Florida and the immediate Gulf Coast, along the California coast, and in southern Arizona.																			0887-381X					JUN	2002	16	2					51	71		10.1061/(ASCE)0887-381X(2002)16:2(51)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0887-381X(2002)16:2(51)													WOS:000175653200001
J	Rodrigo, MA; Vicente, E; Miracle, MR				Rodrigo, MA; Vicente, E; Miracle, MR			The role of light and concentration gradients in the vertical stratification and seasonal development of phototrophic bacteria in a meromictic lake	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The seasonal population dynamics of phototrophic sulphur bacteria and their vertical stratification in Lake La Cruz were studied over two consecutive summers. Development of purple sulphur bacteria occurred just below the oxic-anoxic boundary (the plate located at 14-15 m depth). The principal constituent was a species of Amoebobacter, containing okenone as its main carotenoid and which reached maximal densities at the end of summer (2.2 x 10(6) cells/ml and BChl.-a concentrations of 111 mu g/l in September 1987). Green phototrophic bacteria developed below the Amoebobacter layer at a mean depth of 16 m. Pelodicyton clathratiforme was the dominant species, reaching maximal cell concentrations of 3.1x10(6) cells/ml and BChl.-d concentrations of 362 mu g/l, also in September. Growth of these purple and green sulphur bacteria was light-limited, and sulphide was also present in very low concentrations owing to the low sulphate content of the lake. The two thermal stratification periods under study differed noticeably as a consequence of altered meteorological conditions and structural differences in the water column, with a shallower oxic-anoxic boundary and a major development of algal populations in the upper oxic layer during the second period. This reduced the light available to deep phototrophic bacteria, which were unable to attain the biomass achieved in the earlier period. The monimolimnion of Lake La Cruz acts as a refuge for phototrophic bacteria during the mixing period and this is considered to be a key factor in understanding the ecology of these microorganisms.

A gradient of species richness (121-34), of numbers (4622-1120/m2), of diversity (5.62-2.42 bits), and of equitability (0.81-0.48) extended from the shore to the open water. Also recognized was a seasonal succession of early synchronized species, many of which completed a second generation by late summer, and of more dispersed summer species. This pattern was best exemplified in the shore station, whereas in deeper sites, the assemblages were increasingly less structured and dominated by fewer species. Chaoborus punctipennis. a benthic insect feeding in the water column at night, tended to predominate in the outer stations and to impose its particular seasonal dynamics on the assemblage there. Chronological clustering revealed distinctive early- and late-season assemblages in all sites. A succession of distinct and temporally structured mid-season assemblages was evident at the shore station, but this pattern was obscured in other stations because of the recurrence and dominance of the same species throughout. Though these particular patterns may be restricted to the one lake studied, this approach based on a taxonomical and temporal analysis offers promise for generalizations once it has been applied to a variety of lake systems.																			0071-075X					SPR	1993		165					243	256																WOS:A1993LN49000011

Hydro-morphological characteristics and hydrogeological functioning of a wetland system:: a case study in southern Spain	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												The analysis and interpretation of physical and limnological parameters combined with hydrochemical (major ions and stable isotopes) analyses enabled us to evaluate the hydrogeological functioning and the hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater in two adjacent lakes related to a karstic aquifer (Archidona, southern Spain). Lake water, groundwater and the outflow from a spring, were monitored periodically from 1998 to 1999 and sporadically from 2000 to 2006. The evolution of groundwater chemistry from recharge (dolines) to discharge areas (spring) showed an increment of 20% in magnesium and 15% in sulphate, and such higher increments were recorded for the water from the lakes, suggesting the existence of different hydrogeological paths. A simple water budget model, together with morphological interpretation, suggests that groundwater discharge into the lakes is of relative importance to the input into these systems. Finally, we believe that the development of a new typology for hydro-morphological elements, by means of several hydrological factors and the assessment of pressures and impacts will be useful for the correct management of these lakes and other semi-arid aquatic ecosystems.

The ecological tolerances and optimum values for environmental variables of 15 species were analyzed. Accordingly, maximum numbers of species were found between 700 and 800 m. Ostracod species and sampling sites along with seven environmental variables were ordinated with canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The first axis of CCA explained 72% of the relationship between species and environmental variables. Of these, water temperature, redox potential and altitude were the most influential (P < 0.05) factors for species. Based on habitat similarities, an unweighted pair group mean average dendrogram divided species into four clustering groups. Among the species, Potamocypris arcuata, Candona neglecta and Psychrodromus fontinalis had the highest optimum estimates for altitude, whereas P. arcuata, Herpetocypris brevicaudata and P. fontinalis exhibited the highest tolerances to altitude. While most species revealed unique tolerances and optimum values for different ecological variables, species with cosmopolitan characteristics had wider ranges of ecological tolerances and distribution amid the variety of habitats along elevational gradients.

In addition, hazardous avalanches, rock falls and debris flows have occurred during periods between eruptions. A future eruption of the Tianchi volcano is likely to involve explosive interaction between magma and the caldera lake. The volume of erupted magma is almost in a range of 0.1-0.5 km(3). Tephra fallout may damage agriculture in a large area near the volcano. If only 1% of the lake water were ejected during an eruption and then precipitated over an area of 200 km(2), the average rainfall would be 100 mm. Moreover, lahars are likely to occur as both tephra and water ejected from the caldera lake fall onto flanks of the volcano. Rocks avalanching into the caldera lake also would bring about grave hazards because seiches would be triggered and take water with the volume equal to that of the landslide would spill out of the existing breach in the caldera and cause flooding downstream.

However other exogenous processes including geomorphic activity can affect substantially the rate of tree growth. Currently little is known on how human activity such as trampling affects tree growth along hiking trails. We analyzed annual growth variation in 42 Scots pine trees (Pinus sylvestris L.) subjected to what is known as tourist pressure on a heavily used hiking trail in the Brodnica Lakeland located in Northeastern Poland and compared them with 45 pin. trees growing under natural conditions. Specifically, we compared the climate sensitivity of pine trees growing under trampling pressure with a pine reference site using climate variables such as mean, minimum and maximum monthly air temperature and monthly precipitation. Positive and negative pointer years for two sites were designated using the Becker algorithm and compared. Results revealed that Scots pine annual growth at both sites was highly correlated with winter (January, February) and spring (March) air temperatures and February precipitation. However, both the response function analysis and pointer year analysis revealed higher climatic sensitivity of trees subjected to trampling. It was revealed that thermal and pluvial conditions play an important role for Scots pine growth at the trampling site (PRES), especially in June and July when cambium is probably most active. At the same time, these are the months during which tourist activity is the most intense. Tree growth on a hiking trail was positively correlated with higher precipitation and lower maximum air temperature in June and July. This may indicate that pine trees subjected to trampling are threatened by a potential moisture limitation that occurs within and around the studied hiking trail due to an increase in soil compaction. Additionally, the study revealed growth reduction in pine trees subjected to trampling pressure starting from the late 1970s, i.e., right at a time when a strong increase in tourist traffic was noted across the Brodnica Lakeland. The study shows that human impact associated with trampling on hiking trails significantlly affects the growth of Scots pine and should be taken into account in future dendroecological studies.					; Buchwal, Agata/F-5516-2013	matulewski, pawel/0000-0002-5670-3579; Buchwal, Agata/0000-0001-6879-6656; 													1125-7865	1612-0051				APR	2019	54						78	86		10.1016/j.dendro.2019.02.008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dendro.2019.02.008													WOS:000462163400010

The study reveals nine climate-driven shifts in vegetation over the last 15.2 ka and provides a comprehensive picture of the evolution of the lake sequence. During 15.2-14.5 ka, lower delta C-13 values, relatively higher TOC/TN ratios and xlf values suggest increasing contribution of C(3 )plant-derived organic matter into the lake and enhanced hydroclimatic conditions in the northern Gangetic Plain. Subsequently, a warm and humid phase corresponding to the B phi lling-Aller phi d interstadial is inferred during 14.5-12.8 ka, followed by evidence of a waning of the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) during the Younger Dryas from 12.8-11.7 ka. Despite a strong ISM regime during the early-Greenlandian (11.7-11.0 ka), vegetation shifted from a mixed C-3 -C-4 to a C-4 dominated composition as inferred from higher delta C-13 values, TOC/TN ratios and xlf values. However, a weakened ISM phase is noted between 11.0 and 10.2 ka. On return of warm and humid climatic conditions during 10.2-8.3 ka, tall C-4 Panicoideae grasses flourished around the lake. Two weaker hydroclimatic phases between 8.3 and 6.5 ka and 4.2-2.5 ka favoured C-4-short Chloridoideae grasses over C-4-tall Panicoideae members. Moderate hydroclimatic conditions after 0.6 ka favoured C-4-tall moist-loving grasses. This study shows that before shifting to a C-4-dominated vegetation during the early-Greenlandian to early-Northgrippian, C-3 plants used to dominate the northern Gangetic Plain throughout the late-Pleistocene period. We infer that temperature and rainfall jointly influenced the diversity and distribution of C-4 plants in the northern Gangetic Plain.					ali, sheikh'nawaz/NRY-7735-2025; Bajpai, Sunil/E-8416-2010														0031-0182	1872-616X				APR 1	2022	591								110890	10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.110890	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.110890		FEB 2022											WOS:000792509300002

Lake water level control during the wintering period in 2021-2022 was different than that in 2022-2023. We collected waterbird data from two wintering periods, based on functional alpha and beta diversity and waterbird functional groups, we analyzed the impact of water level regulation on wintering waterbird communities. By remote sensing data of foraging habitats we further analyzed the effects of changes in habitat structure to waterbird communities at different water levels. The results showed that during high lake water level, the numbers of deep water swimmers feeding on fish (G3) and swimmers feeding on seeds (G7) increased significantly, the number of large wading birds feeding on fish (G2) decreased significantly. And high lake water level decreased functional richness indices (FRic), functional evenness indices (FEve) and functional divergence indices (FDiv). Among them, in January and February 2023, the functional divergence indices significantly decreased. Functional beta diversity analysis showed that the total dissimilarity among communities decreased significantly in 2022-2023, with the functional nestedness component increasing significantly in October and February and the functional turnover component decreasing significantly in October, December, and February. Generalised linear mixed models (GLMM) showed that high lake level expanded the water area and favored the habitat of swimming birds, while decreased mudflat area, limiting the habitat space for wading birds. In contrast, lake water level decreased to increase the mudflat area and promoted the differences among communities. This study analysis a coupling relationship among water levels, habitats, and waterbirds, the results show that appropriate lake level regulation is an effective method to protect waterbirds. It provides scientific information for the lake wetland management and waterbird conservation.					xianglin, ji/AAI-2277-2019; Zhou, Lizhi/AAF-4535-2021	zhouZhou, li zhiLizhi/0000-0002-5702-4658; 													1617-1381	1618-1093				MAR	2025	84								126826	10.1016/j.jnc.2025.126826	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2025.126826		JAN 2025											WOS:001409239600001

Dilution plating was done on three types of media with varying nutrient levels. Relatively nutritionally poor medium supported growth of highest number of bacteria (4.98 x 10(3) ml(-1)) compared to nutritionally rich media. On the basis of different morphological features on the plate, 62 aerobic and heterotrophic bacterial strains were isolated and their 16S rRNA genes were sequenced and analyzed. On the basis of sequence similarity these isolates were found to be distributed in 21 different genera belonging to Proteobacteria (58%) followed by Firmicutes (26%), Actinobacteria (13%) and Bacteroidetes (3%). Amplification of 16S rRNA gene of the community DNA using eubacterial primers, followed by cloning and sequencing revealed that predominant members of the habitat belong to the phylum Cyanobacteria (60%) followed by Proteobacteria (19.5%), Bacteroidetes (6.67%), Actinobacteria (4.4%) and Firmicutes (2.2%) and small ribosomal subunit of a plastid (of Chlorophyta, 2.2%).																			0343-8651	1432-0991				JAN	2011	62	1					7	15		10.1007/s00284-010-9663-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-010-9663-9								20461383					WOS:000285927200002

After developing a 21-year loading data set, we used a P mass balance model expressed as a difference equation with an annual time step indexed from mid-April. We defined and estimated a loss parameter lambda as the proportion of the lake's April P concentration lost through sedimentation and outflow during the following year. Using the distribution of annual lambda's and input loadings, we predicted the steady-state distribution of April P concentrations that would result from scenarios of altered inputs due to changes in management practices. These results were then linked to the probability of summer blue-green algal blooms. For no load reduction, the probability of a bloom (>2 mg algae . L-1) on any summer day is about 60%. This probability decreases to 20% with a load reduction of 50%. Our approach illustrates how managers can consider reducing the frequency of extreme events like algal blooms, which may correspond more to the public's perception of lake water quality than average conditions.

It is agriculturally diverse and contributes much to the Indian economy. The region has housed numerous ancient and mediaeval empires. This study presents a continuous record of the paleomonsoon from the Chandrika Devi lake, Lucknow district of Uttar Pradesh, India which is linked with paleo vegetational shifts over the last similar to 6000 years (5871-75 cal yr BP). The chronology of the lake core is based on three accelerated mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon and two Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dates. The multiproxy data (grain size, major and trace element ratio, total organic carbon (TOC wt%), carbon isotopes (delta C-13(org)parts per thousand) and pollen), suggest that the lake was initially a part of the Gomti river that began to transform into a lake at similar to 5000 cal yr BP with weakening of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) in the Central Ganga Basin. The lake formation was completed at similar to 4100 cal yr BP under the influence of the 4.2 ka arid event. This phase marks the beginning of human presence as well as agricultural activities in the lake region with the appearance of Cerealia pollen and other agricultural taxa. The agricultural activity surrounding the lake catchment peaked at similar to 3000 cal yr BP. The lake gradually shrank and became a marshy lowland at similar to 75 cal yr BP. Our study is significant because it is the first comprehensive multiproxy study from the Lucknow region in the Central Ganga Basin on paleomonsoonal variability and its relationship to human activity, agricultural practices during the Late-Holocene with a focus on the 4.2 Ka arid event. Also, pollen record suggests that the changes in agriculture and human activity began just after 4.2 ka arid event in the study area.

To support watershed management for an iconic migratory fish group, we assessed juvenile salmon growth outcomes across habitat use strategies and characterized how these life histories may be impacted by stream connectivity loss. Juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in the Big Lake drainage, Alaska, USA, were individually tracked over 2012-2013 and categorized into habitat use behaviors, with fish either remaining in streams throughout freshwater residency or migrating seasonally to overwinter in lake habitats. Size, growth rate, and body condition of smolts (n = 1113) were compared across habitat use strategies. Juvenile coho salmon that moved seasonally to lake overwintering habitats, the most frequently observed strategy, grew faster and were significantly larger as smolts compared to their counterparts who remained in streams exclusively (spring Age 1 fish: 18% larger by weight, 9% faster growth rate; spring Age 2+ fish: 26% heavier, 11% faster growth). Environmental data from a subset of overwinter lakes indicate that greater foraging opportunity and lower energy costs may be implicated in growth advantages conferred by lentic overwintering strategies. Habitat use strategies requiring seasonal migrations, however, increased exposure to stream connectivity loss, and fish blocked from accessing a potential overwinter headwater lake by a culvert and dam had lowest body condition among study groups. Stream network fragmentation restricts access to preferred overwinter habitats, and our findings suggest this may constrain freshwater rearing strategies associated with strong juvenile coho salmon growth. As size at smolt has been implicated as a driver of salmon survival through ocean residency, reduced freshwater habitat connectivity during juvenile stages may have deleterious impacts on later marine life stages. Consequently, conservation of stream connectivity across lentic and lotic habitats represents an important watershed management priority for juvenile salmon.					; CuervoRestrepo, Felipe/MSX-3066-2025; Carey, Michael/G-9516-2012	Carey, Michael/0000-0002-3327-8995; 													2150-8925					AUG	2022	13	8							e4192	10.1002/ecs2.4192	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4192													WOS:000835280500001

However, the processes of palaeosol development, and their response to climate change, remain controversial due to the complex land-atmosphere interactions within different bioclimatic zones. Here, we review the patterns of palaeosol development, precipitation/moisture (P/ M) evolution, and lake level fluctuations across different sub-regions of the ASMB. With the aid of typical temperature and vegetation records, we qualitatively and quantitatively distinguish the contributions of different climatic factors to palaeosol development since 20 ka (1 ka = 1000 cal yr BP) and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Our results indicate an asynchronous pattern of palaeosol development, with optimum develop-ment during 10-4, 8-4, and 6-2 ka in northeastern (NE) China, north central (NC) China, and on the NE Qinghai -Tibetan Plateau (QTP), respectively. This implies a transmeridional asynchronous pattern of palaeosol devel-opment on the scale of the ASMB. Our qualitative and quantitative analysis of the contributions of climatic variables elucidates the various relationships between palaeosol development and the climatic background across different sub-regions of the ASMB. The results demonstrate that temperature and precipitation are the dominant factors for palaeosol development in NE and NC China, respectively; whereas effective moisture, rather than temperature and precipitation alone, controls palaeosol development on the NE QTP, demonstrating different pedogenic responses against the same overall climatic background. These mechanisms are supported by the results of multiple studies of Holocene vegetation evolution and the associated climatic conditions. We conclude that the asynchronous pattern of palaeosol development across the ASMB was caused by variations in different dominant climatic factors, highlighting the diverse and complex interactions of climate change and Earth surface processes, even within the relatively uniform climatic environment of semiarid northern China. Our findings emphasize the differing responses of palaeosol development to regional climate change and provide new insights into the interactions of the land-atmosphere system in the critical zone of northern China.																			0012-8252	1872-6828				NOV	2022	234								104232	10.1016/j.earscirev.2022.104232	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2022.104232		NOV 2022											WOS:000883825900001

The biomass and production of picophytoplankton, large phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacterioplankton were measured in humic Lake Ortrasket, northern Sweden during four consecutive summers. 2. High flow episodes, carrying fresh dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the lake, always stimulated heterotrophic bacterial production at the expense of primary production. Primary production never exceeded bacterial production for approximately 20 days after such an episode had replenished epilimnial DOC. We suggest that allochthonous DOC is an energy source that stimulates bacterioplankton that, because of their efficient uptake of inorganic nutrients, are then able to outcompete phytoplankton. After the exhaustion of readily available DOC, phytoplankton were able to dominate epilimnion production in Lake Ortrasket. 3. Biomass production was higher when dominated by phytoplankton than by bacterioplankton, despite a similar utilization of nutrients in the epilimnion throughout the summer. We propose that different C : N : P ratios of bacterioplankton and phytoplankton permit the latter to produce more carbon (C) biomass per unit of available inorganic nutrients than bacterioplankton.

J	Pinkham, C				Pinkham, Chris			REBUILDING A LAKE HOUSE COTTAGE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE	JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING												I built my first "green" structure when I was ten years old-a multilevel tree house with views of my backyard and the woods beyond. The whole thing was built from lumber cast off (with permission, honestly) from a construction site down the road and hauled in by kids with wagons. Old nails straightened with hammers, a rusty handsaw for the cuts and a rickety ladder borrowed from some kid's father got us that fort in the sky-and my first experience in recycling and reuse. Actually, I had the privilege of growing up around talented people with solid skills. My grandfather worked on the Old Ironsides renovations at the shipyard in Boston. My father taught me his renovation skills. I worked on a house build when I was fourteen with a man who was a natural at creating beautifully engineered trusses and carriers. When I was a twenty-year-old UConn student, I spent my weekends in New Hampshire helping friends build their summer home out of salvaged materials. Did the experience stick? Who knows? But this dyed-in-the-wool Yankee has always considered material reuse and recycling to be an important part of any build or renovation project. Today, I can look back on thirty-five years as a careful renovator, a thirty-year career as a DHW solar designer and installer, a solar thermal educator for the New Hampshire community college system, and a green builder long before it became fashionable. I belong to that group of "pioneers" that back in the seventies began pushing alternatives to our enormous energy appetites, despite the frustrating knowledge that what we were so right about was falling on deaf ears. Practical alternative solutions to our old ways have always been intriguing and have influenced my philosophy about building, renovating, and solar work over the years.

North American rock glaciers are estimated to contain the third largest water volume equivalent globally, and over 3800 rock glaciers have been mapped in Colorado alone. However, these features are often overlooked in alpine water budgets. In this study, we present initial results using geophysical, hydrochemical, and repeat structure from motion data to investigate the ice presence, downslope movement, and influence on stream chemistry of the Lake Agnes rock glacier in the northern Front Range, Colorado, USA. We measured an average velocity of 23 +/- 4 cm year(-1) in the upper 400 m of the rock glacier, with maximum velocities up to 36 +/- 4 cm year(-1). Rock glacier-fed streams (n = 2) near the spring remained below 2.5 degrees C throughout the summer, mixed-source streams (n = 3) remained below 3.5 degrees C, and a non-rock glacier stream (n = 1) reached 13.5 degrees C. Rock glacier streams additionally recorded elevated ion concentrations and pH relative to the mixed-source and lake-fed streams. Geophysical surveys suggest that the rock glacier has an internal structure consisting of a similar to 3-m-thick active layer, underlain by an ice-poor layer up to 10 m thick and by an ice-rich layer up to 18 m thick, with total rock glacier thickness between 20 and 30 m. This study supports the presence of ice within the Lake Agnes rock glacier and documents the rock glacier's influence on basin hydrochemistry. In many basins, including Lake Agnes, the reduced climate sensitivity of rock glaciers and their sustained cold-water input to mountain streams will likely provide a refuge for cold-water species in a warming climate.

Algoflora of Lakes in the Kurgalsky Nature Reserve (Leningrad Oblast)	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												Various algocenoses were studied in the brackish-water Lake Lipovskoe and ultraoligotrophic Lake Beloe in May and July 2019. In the algal flora of the lakes, 291 taxa from nine phylums were found. Both lakes were characterized by high species richness; 179 and 181 algae taxa were identified in Lake Lipovskoe and Lake Beloe, respectively. The phytoplankton in Lake Lipovskoe was dominated by Cyanophyta (Cyanoprokaryota), Cryptophyta and Dinophyta, among which brackish-water and marine species were present. Brackish-water diatoms and green algae dominated in periphyton of the lake. In Lake Beloe, phytoplankton was dominated by Dinophyta, Bacillariophyta, and Chlorophyta; blue-greens, diatoms, and green algae dominated in the periphyton of the lake. Despite the proximity of the lakes, their algal flora is quite different: the Sorensen similarity index between the two lakes was only 38%. The phytoplankton biomass in both lakes was low, increasing from spring to summer. In Lake Lipovskoe, the phytoplankton biomass varied from 0.45 to 1.9 mg/L, chlorophyll a fluctuated from 3.9 to 7.1 mu g/L. In Lake Beloe, the phytoplankton biomass varied from 0.3 to 1.4 mg/L and chlorophyll a fluctuated from 0.45 to 1.3 mu g/L. The periphyton biomass was 20 g/m(2) (chlorophyll a, 22 mg/m(2)) and 17 g/m(2) (chlorophyll a, 17 mg/m(2)) in the Lipovskoe and Beloe lakes, respectively. At present, the ecological status of both the lakes can be considered satisfactory because with regard to the trophic conditions and species composition they belong to water bodies of clean and satisfactory clean conditions (classes II-III of water quality). To preserve the unique flora of the lakes in the Kurgalsky Nature Reserve, the nature-protective measures should be strengthened.

J	Aigars, J				Aigars, J			Seasonal variations in phosphorus species in the surface sediments of the Gulf of Riga, Baltic Sea	CHEMOSPHERE												The redox-dependent variations in concentrations of phosphorus at two different accumulation bottom areas were investigated in the Gulf of Riga (Baltic Sea) between December 1993 and January 1995. The sediment samples from nine sampling occasions were analyzed for phosphorus forms and redox potential. The average concentrations of total phosphorus measured in 0-1 cm (65 and 89 mu mol P g(-1) for sites G5 and T3, respectively) were among the highest reported from the entire Baltic Sea. Redox-dependent "mobile" phosphorus (MP) contributed more than 50% of total in the uppermost-oxidized centimeter, whereas in reduced layers it was 16-18% throughout the year. The significant differences (ANOVA, P <0.01) among months of inorganic phosphorus (IP) concentration at 0-1 cm were observed at site G5 due to temporary accumulation of mobile phosphorus mediated by redox-dependent bacteria activity during summer. On the contrary no accumulation was observed at T3 probably as a result of low redox potential caused by high accumulation rates and low bioturbation. Although the water column above sediments remained oxic throughout the investigation period, the redox potential at site T3 was close to the redoxcline (i.e., +230 mV) during summer. Further increase of eutrophication might lead to development of anoxic conditions at sediment-water interface and that in turn will result in rapid release of redox-dependent phosphorus stored in surface sediments. The availability of excess phosphorus will further enhance eutrophication in partly phosphorus-limited Gulf of Riga. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The non-profit trail advocacy group, Friends of the Mountains to Sea Trail, is responsible for the trail's upkeep and maintenance. For this study, use and user characteristics were examined along with trail appeal factors, users' motivations for utilizing the trail, and their satisfaction while there. Another important objective was to examine potential problems relative to hiker interactions with hunters. Hunting is permitted along approximately 20 miles of the trail. Although few trail users reported encountering hunters during their visit, approximately one third reported being "not at all comfortable" sharing the trail with hunters. There was a modest degree of discomfort overall.																									2006		P-14					152	+																WOS:000250664700020

Therefore, a 5,000 m(2) vertical flow wetland system was constructed in 1998 to reduce the phosphorus discharge from combined sewer overflows without reducing the water supply to the lake. During dry periods the constructed wetland is used to remove phosphorus from the lake water. The system is designed as a 90 m diameter circular bed with a bed depth of c. 2 m. The system is isolated from the surroundings by a polyethylene membrane. The bed medium consists of a mixture of gravel and crushed marble, which has a high binding capacity for phosphorus. The bed is located within the natural littoral zone of the lake and is planted with common reed (Phragmites australis). The constructed wetland is intermittently loaded with combined sewer overflow water or lake water and, after percolation through the bed medium, the water is collected in a network of drainage pipes at the bottom of the bed and pumped to the lake. The fully automated loading cycle results in alternating wet and dry periods. During the initial two years of operation, the phosphorus removal for combined sewer overflows has been consistently high (94-99% of inflow concentrations). When loaded with lake water, the phosphorus removal has been high during summer (71-97%) and lower during winter (53-75%) partly because of lower inlet concentrations. Effluent phosphorus concentrations are consistently low (0.03-0.04 mg/L). Ammonium nitrogen is nitrified in the constructed wetland, and total suspended solids and COD are generally reduced to concentrations below 5 mg/L and 25 mg/L, respectively.

This wetland water could be possibly contributing to this lake's ageing. Thus, as an initial investigation, an on-site potential remediation of this wetland water discharge using a non-woven geotextile filtration technique is proposed. The method was based on a tank located near the lakeshore with a floating geotextile filtration system in continuous mode (i.e., 0.5-day retention time). On deployment, wetland water was pumped into the tank using a calibrated peristaltic pump (inlet), filtered by a selected set of non-woven geotextiles with distinct apparent opening sizes, and then returned to the lake (outlet) by gravity. This experiment ran throughout the summer and mid-fall of 2021. Samples from both the inlet and tank were taken every 2 days, and filter layers were changed upon clogging. The objective of this study was to improve the quality of this discharge before entering the lake by filtration. The water quality parameters monitored during the experiment from both inlet and tank samples were total phosphorus, total nitrogen, nitrate, chemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids, particle size, and turbidity. The non-woven geotextile filters removed nutrients, organic matter, and suspended particles at levels of 32%, 17%, and 29% for total phosphorus, COD, and turbidity removals, respectively, when the tank inlet and outlet were compared during the entire experiment. In addition, it was proven that the proposed method is easy to install, deploy, and quickly adapt to water quality changes. Even though the results have pointed out that additional investigation is needed, the treatment improved the quality of a portion of this wetland water. Thus, the feasibility of treatment has been shown for this possible remediation.																			2366-2557	2366-2565	978-3-031-34595-1; 978-3-031-34593-7; 978-3-031-34592-0				2023	363						1043	1056		10.1007/978-3-031-34593-7_67	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-34593-7_67													WOS:001267355200067
J	Lindenschmidt, KE; Sereda, J				Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich; Sereda, Jeff			The impact of macrophytes on winter flows along the Upper Qu'Appelle River	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL												The Upper Qu'Appelle River conveys water from Lake Diefenbaker to Buffalo Pound Lake, which is a major source of water for domestic, industrial, agricultural and recreational use in southern Saskatchewan. Water demand continues to increase with time and additional conveyance capacity may be required during the winter months. Flows in the Upper Qu'Appelle are usually below 2 m(3) s(-1) from December to March; however, an increase in this flow rate will be needed to meet future water demands. A numerical modelling study was carried out to simulate the degree of ice cover thickening and backwater staging during freeze-up at various discharge scenarios (up to 6 m(3) s(-1)). The Monte Carlo framework was used to capture the variability of possible parameter ranges within various freeze-up scenarios. A bottleneck to flow conveyance is a short 4-km stretch along the river (between the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration [PFRA] and Tugaske Bridges) which is infested with macrophyte growth. Results show that the probability of overbank flow greatly increases with the presence of macrophytes in the channel, even at freeze-up conditions. Dredging was deemed the best mitigation option to reduce macrophyte density and remove nutrient-rich sediment to increase flow capacity.

The variation of water surface temperature with time for different areas of the lake is discussed using temperature measurements obtained by means of an aircraft-mounted IR-radiometer. Maximum values of water surface temperature in these areas, as well as the time lags between the areas are determined. Mean rates of temperature variation for the periods of warming and cooling of the lake are also determined. A formula for determining the location of the spring frontal zone at different stages of water warming is suggested. The peculiarities of the interaction of stratified and isothermal waters in the frontal zone, the slope of the frontal zone and the thermal balance components are discussed on the basis of specialized field measurements by using ships and aeroplane. The scales of temperature inhomogeneities are obtained based on computation of 2D spatial correlation functions.

The carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta C-13, delta N-15) of sources (epiphytes, macrophytes, suspended particulate matter _SPM) and of macroinvertebrate consumers were measured in a fluvial lake with extensive macrophyte beds (emergent and submerged). To determine the relative contribution of each OM source to macroinvertebrate diets we used the IsoSource model that examines all possible combinations of solutions for each source. Total and MeHg concentrations of consumers were also measured. Results show that epiphytes and macrophytes are dominant in the diet of macroinvertebrates, especially in early summer (July). In mid-summer (August), SPM constitutes a non-negligible OM source to the primary consumers. Hg concentrations were higher in epiphytes than in the other OM sources. The proportion of epiphytes in macroinvertebrate diet was positively correlated with the percentage of MeHg in their tissues. There was no relationship between SPM assimilation and Hg concentration in macroinvertebrate consumers. These results suggest that epiphytes and macrophytes constitute the main pathway of Hg bioaccumulation in littoral food webs.					; Cremona, Fabien/D-1385-2013	Lucotte, Marc/0000-0002-6360-2979; Planas, Dolors/0000-0003-0901-2887; Cremona, Fabien/0000-0002-0559-6259													0168-2563	1573-515X				MAY	2009	94	1					81	94		10.1007/s10533-009-9309-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-009-9309-9													WOS:000266733200006
J	Dyukarev, YA				Dyukarev, Yegor A.			DIURNAL AMPLITUDE OF PEAT SOIL TEMPERATURE	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL												The results of monitoring of peat soil temperature in an oligotrophic pine-shrubsphagnum community at the field station "Vasyugan" in Bakchar district of Tomsk Region are given. Monitoring of soil temperature at depths of 2, 5, 10, 15, 25, 40, 60 and 80 cm was carried out by autonomous temperature logger from June 28, 2005 to September 6, 2010 with a time step of 15 minutes in summer and 1 hour in winter. The results of observation reflect the general patterns of input and output of solar radiation coming onto the active surface. In the warm season diurnal fluctuations of temperature penetrate to a depth of 25 cm. The amplitude of the diurnal temperature variation is 5.9-10.2 degrees C at the surface layer, and 0.3-0.5 degrees C at a depth of 25 cm. The diurnal variation of soil surface temperature is usually characterized by a maximum in the middle of the day and a minimum just before sunrise. The maximum soil temperature at a depth of 2 cm is observed at about 4 pm local time in May-June, and at a depth of 5 cm the maximum is observed at 5 pm, at a depth of 10 cm - at 6 pm, at a depth of 15 cm - at 8 pm. At a depth of 25 cm from the surface the maximum temperature is weak, and it is 5 hours later than at a depth of 2 cm. In June and July the minimum soil temperature in the diurnal course at a depth of 2 cm is observed at 6 am. At a depth of 5 cm the time lag is 40 min, at a depth of 10 cm - 1 hour and 30 minutes, at a depth of 15 cm - 2 h 30 min, and at a depth of 25 cm - more than 5 hours. Thermal fluctuations in peat soil are effectively neutralised: in the upper layer due to the high insulating ability of moss, in the lower layers because of the saturation of peat by water and the absence of convective motions. Variations of temperature fluctuations amplitude with a known period allow us to determine the coefficient of effective diffusivity. The effective thermal diffusivity of the upper layer of moss is 8 - 9 cm(2)/hr from June to September. Low values of thermal diffusivity (5.05 cm(2)/hr) are observed in May due to low humidity of mosses.																			1561-7793	1561-803X				DEC	2012		365					201	+																WOS:000421517100040

J	Nuruzzama, M; Rahaman, W; Mohan, R				Nuruzzama, Mohammad; Rahaman, Waliur; Mohan, Rahul			Sources, distribution and biogeochemical cycling of dissolved trace elements in the coastal lakes of Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Coastal lakes in Antarctica receive an enormous amount of ions and trace elements (its) during the austral summer. Some of these TEs and ions are utilised as essential nutrients in primary productivity. In the present study, selected dissolved TEs (Ba, Mn. Cu, Co, Cd, Mo and U) along with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and Chlorophyll-a were studied in ten coastal lakes of the Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica to decipher their (TEs) sources, understand geochemical behaviour and assess their role on nutrient dynamics. Dissolved concentrations of these TEs are in sub-nanomolar range; almost an order of magnitude lower than the average seawater and global river concentrations. Sea-salt spray and chemical weathering in the catchments of these lakes are dominant sources for these TEs and ions. Though most of the Antarctic lakes have been reported for their oligotrophic character, however, a significant amount of DOC and Chlorophyll-a, and occurrence of algal mats in some of the LH lakes indicate seasonal (austral summer) productivity with the availability of sunlight and nutrients. Our investigation reveals that phosphate (PO43-) and Mo act as limiting nutrients because of their lower concentrations in the water column. Dissolved Cu plays an important role in bacterial-induced organic matter decompositions and release of organic carbon to lake water. We also found Ba excess (non-terrigenous) in the lake and catchment sediments varying from 26 to 63%. The higher Ba-excess in the catchment sediments could be due to significant removal of dissolved Ba during the solute transport and later supplied to these lakes. The geochemical data sets presented in this study were found at a natural background level and therefore, would be useful for comparison with other global aquatic environments. Findings of the present study improve our understanding about the biogeochemical cycling of trace elements and their critical role in oligotrophic lakes of Antarctica. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Contrasting Effects of Sorghum Biochars and Sorghum Residues on Soil Chemical Changes of Coastal Plains Ultisols With Winter Wheat	SOIL SCIENCE												Although most soil properties were improved following application of crop residues and/or pyrolyzed crop residues, there is still a need to pursue additional research that will improve our understanding of the impact of soil fertility enhancement because the effect could vary greatly between uncharred sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) residues and pyrolyzed sorghum residues (SR). We hypothesized that sorghum biochars (SB) would deliver more significant impact on soil chemical changes than SR. The objective of this study was to evaluate the contrasting effects of SR and SB with or without supplemental inorganic P on soil chemical changes of Coastal Plains Ultisols with winter wheat. The application rates for SR and SB based on 13.5 Mg ha(-1) yield goal for wheat were 13,000 and 5,200 kg.ha(-1), respectively. Inorganic P was added at the rate of 40 kg P.ha(-1). Our results fully support our hypothesis that SB would deliver more positive effect on the changes of soil chemical properties than the SR. Most of the chemical properties of soils were significantly affected by sorghum treatments (SB + SR) and also varied widely between soil types. Overall, application of SB had small, but significant effects on soil pH, soil electrical conductivity, total carbon, and total nitrogen. Quite notably was the significant difference of these soil properties between soil types. Other aspects of soil chemical changes including extractable P, K, Ca, Mg, Al, and Fe were significantly affected by sorghum treatments. Our results have demonstrated widely differing and contrasting effects between SB and SR on changes in soil chemical properties of Coastal Plains Ultisols.

Dune formation on late Holocene sandy bay barriers along Lake Michigan's Door Peninsula: The importance of increased sediment supply following the Nipissing and Algoma high lake-level phases	COASTLINE AND DUNE EVOLUTION ALONG THE GREAT LAKES	Geological Society of America Special Papers											This study focuses on the geomorphology and geochronology of dunes formed on three sandy barrier systems at Clark, Europe and Kangaroo Lakes in Wisconsin's Door Peninsula. The Lake Michigan shoreline in the peninsula contains abundant evidence for fluctuations in lake level with paleo-shoreline features that lie up to similar to 7 m above the present shoreline. Dunes are not very common along the Lake Michigan shoreline in Wisconsin, but the three bay barriers studied contain beach ridges that were buried by varying depths of eolian sand in the form of low relief sandsheets as well as parabolic and transverse dunes that have relief of up to 21 m. The purpose of this study was to document when the barriers formed and when the subsequent eolian activity occurred. The chronology presented here for barrier emplacement and dune development is based on 65 optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) samples which were collected from littoral sediment in the barriers (n = 17) and the overlying eolian sand (n = 48). Sediment samples were collected using bucket augers or a vibracoring device at depths ranging from 0.5 to 4.1 m below the ground surface. The OSL ages show that barriers in each of the study sites were constructed between similar to 5.9 and 3.9 ka, corresponding closely to the Nipissing high lake phase. OSL ages falling between 3.3 and 2.5 ka at the Kangaroo Lake site suggest the portion of the barrier closest to Lake Michigan formed during the Algoma phase. The majority of the eolian ages fall into two primary groups that overlap with or are slightly younger than the ages acquired from the barriers. These results suggest eolian activity ended between 4.5 and 3.7 (n = 20 ages) and 2.5 and 1.8 (n = 11 ages) ka. Both geomorphic and geochronological evidence suggests that dune development occurred rapidly when sand supply increased as lake levels fell following these two transgressive events.																			0072-1077		978-0-8137-2508-6				2014	508						65	83		10.1130/2014.2508(05)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2014.2508(05)	10.1130/9780813725086												WOS:000342837200006

The nets were set at depths of approximately 15-45 m (nearshore stations, < 4 km offshore) and more than 55 m (offshore stations, 4-24 km offshore). Salmonids were concentrated near shore, where they partitioned available habitat and, thus, food resources. Horizontal habitat was partitioned with respect to distance from shore; vertical habitat was partitional in relation to temperature and the thermocline. Salmonids foraged for the most available prey items within their habitat. Overlaps in both food use and horizontal habitat use were inversely related to overlap in use of vertical habitat. There was increased habitat separation between sexes of those species caught farther from shore. At the salmonid stocking and prey density levels existing during our study, lake trout, brown trout, and chinook salmon appeared to partition resources and minimize deleterious trophic interactions during thermal stratification.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV	1988	117	6					552	559		10.1577/1548-8659(1988)117<0552:RPISBS>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1988)117<0552:RPISBS>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1988U731400005

Bioindicator "fingerprints" of methane-emitting thermokarst features in Alaskan soils	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Permafrost thaw increases the bioavailability of ancient organic matter, facilitating microbial metabolism of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon dioxide, and methane (CH4). The formation of thermokarst (thaw) lakes in icy, organic-rich Yedoma permafrost leads to high CH4 emissions, and subsurface microbes that have the potential to be biogeochemical drivers of organic carbon turnover in these systems. However, to better characterize and quantify rates of permafrost changes, methods that further clarify the relationship between subsurface biogeochemical processes and microbial dynamics are needed. In this study, we investigated four sites (two well-drained thermokarst mounds, a drained thermokarst lake, and the terrestrial margin of a recently formed thermokarst lake) to determine whether biogenic VOCs (1) can be effectively collected during winter, and (2) whether winter sampling provides more biologically significant VOCs correlated with subsurface microbial metabolic potential. During the cold season (March 2023), we drilled boreholes at the four sites and collected cores to simultaneously characterize microbial populations and captured VOCs. VOC analysis of these sites revealed "fingerprints" that were distinct and unique to each site. Total VOCs from the boreholes included > 400 unique VOC features, including > 40 potentially biogenic VOCs related to microbial metabolism. Subsurface microbial community composition was distinct across sites; for example, methanogenic archaea were far more abundant at the thermokarst site characterized by high annual CH4 emissions. The results obtained from this method strongly suggest that similar to 10% of VOCs are potentially biogenic, and that biogenic VOCs can be mapped to subsurface microbial metabolisms. By better revealing the relationship between subsurface biogeochemical processes and microbial dynamics, this work advances our ability to monitor and predict subsurface carbon turnover in Arctic soils.

Based on satellite and field data, we developed a mathematical model incorporating fuzzy logic and probabilistic methods to directly estimate the biomass of seven different phytoplankton species in Huating Lake. Water surface temperature (WST) and chlorophyll-a concentration ([Chl-a]) were selected as input parameters for this model. The WST data were processed using a single-channel algorithm that combined the brightness temperature conversion model and land surface emissivity algorithm. Inversion of [Chl-a] was conducted using an empirical approach to compare the four models developed for the two sensitive reflectance bands. The [Chl-a] values obtained from these models were significantly correlated with the field data (R > 0.8). The optimal model was selected based on validation results. After obtaining the inversion results for the WST and [Chl-a], we applied a fuzzy probabilistic model to determine the PCCs in Huating Lake from 2013 to 2023. A comparison with the measured data confirmed that this method reliably estimated PCC biomass (R > 0.65). However, the modeling accuracy was not particularly high for Bacillariophyta and Euglenophyta with high biomass. We analyzed the spatial and temporal distribution of PCCs in Huating Lake over 10 years from 2013 to 2023 and found that the results were reasonable. The results demonstrate that the fuzzy probabilistic approach offers a novel methodology for estimating the biomass of seven phytoplankton species. This method facilitates the expansion of remote-sensing technology for monitoring PCC changes in mountainous reservoirs and provides scientific data support for understanding algal bloom mechanisms and developing prevention strategies.					qiu, yixuan/AAF-8393-2021														1574-9541	1878-0512				NOV	2025	89								103153	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2025.103153	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2025.103153		APR 2025											WOS:001485145700001

This will pose severe problems for Arctic and sub-Arctic infrastructure dependent on maintaining low temperatures for structural integrity. This is the case for the economically important Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road (TCWR)-the world's busiest heavy haul ice road, spanning 400 km across mostly frozen lakes within the Northwest Territories of Canada. In this study, future climate scenarios are developed for the region using statistical downscaling methods. In addition, changes in lake ice thickness are projected based on historical relationships between measured ice thickness and air temperatures. These projections are used to infer the theoretical operational dates of the TCWR based on weight limits for trucks on the ice. Results across three climate models driven by four RCPs reveal a considerable warming trend over the coming decades. Projected changes in ice thickness reveal a trend towards thinner lake ice and a reduced time window when lake ice is at sufficient thickness to support trucks on the ice road, driven by increasing future temperatures. Given the uncertainties inherent in climate modelling and the resultant projections, caution should be exercised in interpreting the magnitude of these scenarios. More certain is the direction of change, with a clear trend towards winter warming that will reduce the operation time window of the TCWR. This illustrates the need for planners and policymakers to consider future changes in climate when planning annual haulage along the TCWR.					; Swindles, Graeme/AAU-4321-2020	galloway, jennifer/0000-0002-4548-6396; Mullan, Donal/0000-0002-6363-3150; Pisaric, Michael/0000-0003-3806-8986; Macumber, Andrew L/0000-0001-6212-0655; Swindles, Graeme/0000-0001-8039-1790													0177-798X	1434-4483				AUG	2017	129	3-4					1089	1108		10.1007/s00704-016-1830-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-016-1830-x													WOS:000406123400027

Modeling diverse environmental responses of reservoirs to floating photovoltaic systems	LIMNOLOGICA												Floating photovoltaic (FPV) systems are emerging as a promising strategy for large-scale clean energy production worldwide. However, by altering key physical drivers such as solar radiation and wind mixing, FPV installations may have also unintended consequences for lakes and reservoirs. Given the wide diversity of freshwater systems globally, understanding the consistency in direction and magnitude of environmental responses to FPV deployment is critical for informed regulatory oversight and sustainable energy development. Here, we used process-based models to simulate the effects of FPV coverage on 11 reservoirs across the United States. This is the first multi-reservoir analysis using a laterally averaged 2D process-based modeling framework to systematically evaluate FPV impacts across diverse climatic and morphometric contexts, enabling direct comparison of magnitude and direction of responses among systems. Specifically, we evaluated changes in (1) surface and outflow temperature, (2) thermocline depth, (3) water column stability, (4) dissolved oxygen concentrations, and (5) potential suitable habitat availability for warm-and cold-water fishes. We quantified changes in these response variables by an iterative approach that simulates increases in FPV coverage and compares them with reference conditions. We summarized responses for winter (January-February) and summer (July-August). As expected, our simulations show that increasing FPV coverage consistently cooled surface waters and altered thermal stratification patterns, but the magnitude and environmental implications of these changes varied among reservoirs. Notably, greater FPV coverage led to increased variability in habitat suitability for aquatic species, with some reservoirs exhibiting distinct and sometimes divergent responses. These findings underscore the importance of considering local environmental contexts when assessing FPV impacts. While large-scale FPV systems offer potential benefits for climate mitigation, their ecological effects, particularly on thermally sensitive biota, require careful site-specific evaluation to avoid unintended consequences to local freshwater biodiversity.																			0075-9511	1873-5851				NOV	2025	115								126293	10.1016/j.limno.2025.126293	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2025.126293													WOS:001593228000001

The Impacts of an AMOC Slowdown on Southern Hemisphere and Australian Climates at 8.2 ka in ACCESS-ESM1.5 Model	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Greenland ice cores reveal an abrupt cooling of up to 3.3 degrees C 8.2 kyr ago (8.2 ka), lasting for roughly 160 years. The event was likely caused by a weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) due to freshwater drainage into the North Atlantic. It was associated with a global-scale climate change but is recorded in very few high-resolution paleoclimatic time series from the Southern Hemisphere (SH). In this study, we investigate the 8.2 ka event in the SH, particularly the Australian climate response to a weakened AMOC. Five North Atlantic meltwater experiments are conducted with the Australian Earth System Model, ACCESS-ESM1.5, to evaluate the sensitivity of AMOC responses to freshwater perturbations under early Holocene conditions as well as their climate impact. Our results suggest a 100 year freshwater pulse reproduces a global climate change that best matches existing proxy records for the 8.2 ka event. Australian surface air temperatures show significant cooler conditions in the northern half of the continent but warmer anomalies in the south in response to a weakened AMOC. Australian hydroclimate displays a more complex response at 8.2 ka. Northern Australian precipitation is influenced by a southward shift in the mean position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and a strengthened Indo-Australian summer monsoon, while the southern part of the continent is more sensitive to weakening of the winter westerly winds. These results highlight the importance of understanding the Australian climate response to a weakened AMOC under different background climate in order to better predict potential future impacts.

Stable isotope variations in stalagmites from northwestern Sweden document changes in temperature and vegetation during the early Holocene: a reply to Hammarlund and Edwards	HOLOCENE												In a comment on the paper by Sundqvist et al. (2007a), Hammarlund and Edwards suggest that the oxygen isotope signal of the speleothem records K1 and L4 from northwestern Sweden as well as for the earlier published stalagmite SG93 from northern Norway should mainly reflect variation in the delta(18)O of mean annual precipitation. The main argument used by the authors is that the SG93 delta(18)O record should show remarkable similarities with the lacustrine carbonate delta(18)O record from Lake Tibetanus. The similarities between SG93 and Lake Tibetanus are mainly seen for the period between 10 and 9 ka BP, which is a period where both records have higher delta(18)O values compared with later in the Holocene. If true, this would indicate that temperatures in northern Scandinavia would have reached their Holocene maximum between 10 and 9 ka BP, which is contrary to what has been reported from other archives in the region which place the Holocene climatic optimum somewhere between 8 and 5 ka BP. Several factors affect the delta(18)O of speleothems and definitely also by annual mean delta(18)O of the local precipitation. However, for Holocene speleothems from northern Scandinavia as well as from the Alps this signal seems to be overridden by other factors, such as variable mixing of summer and winter precipitation of cave drip water as well as the temperature-dependent fractionation between calcite and water. But the relative importance of the factors can differ between different timescales, caves and even speleothems from the same cave, depending on hydrological pathways. To better understand the factors controlling the stable oxygen isotopes in precipitation and proxy archives back in time there is a need for more highly resolved records as well as for more atmospheric and hydrological modelling.

J	Rossetti, C; Pomati, F; Calamari, D				Rossetti, C; Pomati, F; Calamari, D			Microorganisms' activity and energy fluxes in lake varese (Italy): A field method	WATER RESEARCH												Microorganisms are fundamental components of energy fluxes in aquatic ecosystems. Interest in plankton production and respiration has recently stimulated exploration of the use of electron transfer system (ETS) activity in oceanography and limnology. If we consider microorganism production (MP) and microorganism respiration (MR), due to aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, microorganism growth efficiency can be defined as MGE=MP/(MP+MR). In order to calculate MGE, we measured independently the two components of ETS (photosynthesis electron transfer system activity (PETS) and respiration electron transfer system activity (RETS)) during an annual cycle using a portable biosensor microorganisms amperometric detector system (MiDAS) on the site. MGE was calculated in samples collected from the photic and aphotic zones and the superficial sediment and ranged between 0.60 and 0.45 and dropped to 0.15 at the end of the summer. This substantial decrease is probably due to the prevalence of the anaerobic-heterotrophic metabolism after a pronounced state of anoxia during the summer algal bloom. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A multi-proxy analysis was performed along a 58 cm long sediment core and two training sets were used for quantitative July air temperature reconstructions: the Eastern-European (EE, 212 lakes) and the Finnish-Polish-Carpathian (FPC, 273 lakes). The transfer functions had a coefficient of determination (r(2)) 0.88 and 0.91 with a root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) 0.88 degrees C and 1.02 degrees C. Despite possible biases resulting from methodological problems and the ecological complexity of the chironomid response to both climatic and environmental changes, the agreement of the temperature reconstruction of Lake Latori.ei with other alpine records suggests that the transfer function successfully reconstructed past summer temperatures between 750 and 1830 CE. Biases in the temperature reconstruction in the period before 750 and after 1830 CE were likely caused by increased abundance of rheophilic and semi-terrestrial chironomid species related to increased inflow activity before 750 CE and local land use changes after 1830 CE, which was also indicated by increasing deforestation and increasing lake productivity in the pollen and diatom records. Our results suggest that the region experienced a warm period between 750 and 1360 CE, and a cold period between 1360 and 1600 CE followed by fluctuating summer temperatures until 1830 CE. These events were associated with the so-called 'Mediaeval Warm Period' (MWP) and the 'Little Ice Age' (LIA), respectively. The inference models reconstructed a decrease in July air temperatures by 0.7 degrees C-1.1 degrees C during the LIA relative to the warmer MWP. We also demonstrated that the FPC training set gives better results, supporting that local/continental training sets are efficient to detect weak amplitude summer temperature changes in the Late-Holocene.

J	Shrader, TM; Weldon, M				Shrader, TM; Weldon, M			Growth dynamics of smallmouth bass in Lake Billy Chinook, Oregon	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												During May-October, 200 1, we analyzed the growth patterns and diet overlap of different ages of smallmouth bass in Lake Billy Chinook, Oregon to identify periods within the growing season when temperature or competition for food might limit growth. Bass of various ages were sampled during three 6-wk periods with a boat-mounted electroshocker from nearshore sites in two separate habitat types. Age 0 bass consumed smaller prey items, while older and larger fish were able to consume an increasingly wider size range of prey, predominantly crayfish. Bass consumed fewer crayfish through the study. Age I smallmouth bass consumed only age 0 crayfish, while older bass were not as limited. Diets of age 3 and age 4 smallmouth bass were similar with crayfish constituting at least 70% of the diets by volume, although amphipods and other invertebrates were important prey items to individual fish. During all periods of the study, realized consumption, defined as actual consumption divided by theoretical metabolic maximum consumption and indexed by the P-value generated from bioenergetic modeling, was generally higher for smaller fish than for larger bass. Consumption rates for juvenile and adult bass dropped dramatically in the fall demonstrating potential food limitation during this period. Our study suggests that during the fall, high densities of age 0 bass may affect the availability of alternative prey (chironomids and amphipods) and consequently, the growth of older age classes of smallmouth bass.																			0029-344X					SUM	2004	78	3					250	260																WOS:000224512100009

This EAS Cherenkov array started data acquisition in the Tunka Valley (50 km from Lake Baikal) in autumn 2009. Tunka-133 provides a measurement of the EAS maximum depth (X,,) with an accuracy of about 30 g/cm(2). Further mass composition analyses at the highest energies (10(17) - 10(18) eV) will be based on the comparison of primary energy measured by the radio method and the densities of charged particles measured by shielded and unshielded detectors. The high duty cycle of the common operation of the new scintillation array (Tunka-Grande) and the radio extension of the experiment (Tunka-REX) will provide a high statistics of events.

Natural radioactivity in various water samples and radiation dose estimations in Bolu province, Turkey	CHEMOSPHERE												The level of natural radioactivity for Bolu province of north-western Turkey was assessed in this study. There is no information about radioactivity measurement reported in water samples in the Bolu province so far. For this reason, gross alpha and beta activities of 55 different water samples collected from tap, spring, mineral, river and lake waters in Bolts were determined. The mean activity concentrations were 68.11 mBq L-1, 169.44 mBq L-1 for gross alpha and beta in tap water. For all samples the gross beta activity is always higher than the gross a activity. All value of the gross alpha were lower than the limit value of 500 mBq L-1 while two spring and one mineral water samples were found to have gross beta activity concentrations of greater than 1000 mBq L-1. The associated age-dependent dose from all water ingestion in Bolu was estimated. The total dose for adults had an average value exceeds the WHO recommended limit value. The risk levels from the direct ingestion of the natural radionuclides in tap and mineral water in Bolu were determinated. The mean Po-210 and Ra-228 risk the value of tap and mineral waters slightly exceeds what some consider on acceptable risk of 10(-4) or less. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Seasonal change in the intensity of fish predation affects succession in lake zooplankton communities. Predation affects not only the zooplankton prey, but also their parasites. Because the ability of a parasite to spread depends in part on the death rate of the hosts, seasonal reductions in the intensity of predation on zooplankton could lead to parasite epidemics. We examined seasonal population dynamics, mortality rate, and incidence of parasitism in lake populations of Daphnia to determine whether parasitism displayed seasonality and synchrony among lake populations and whether any such patterns are consistent with seasonal changes in predation rates. Infections of a bacterial parasite (Spirobacillus cienkowskii) in Daphnia dentifera populations were seasonal with epidemics in many lakes occurring synchronously in autumn. In situ foraging behavior of the dominant fish planktivores, bluegill sunfish, is highly selective on infected Daphnia. Mortality rates on the Daphnia drop just prior to the initiation of epidemics. An epidemiological model shows that this magnitude of decrease in mortality rate, if driven largely by a reduction in predation, can account for the seasonal occurrence of epidemics in our Daphnia populations. Together, these results suggest that parasitism in Daphnia populations may be seasonally restricted by fish predation.

In this study, a detailed geochemical investigation, combined with sedimentological characterization, was conducted on the Wugonglilu siliceous deposit, a Cretaceous (106 Ma) sinter in NE China, to examine its genesis. The deposit is inferred as a siliceous hot spring deposit (sinter) owing to its geological setting in an epithermal gold-mining district, its morphologically variable microbial textures typical of subaerial sinters, and nearly pure silica composition. Three lithofacies were recognized in this study, including laminated to thinly bedded sinter, silica-cemented breccia, and epithermal vein, which represent deposits from three contrasting hydrothermal environments. The 87Sr/86Sr ratios of the sinter are similar to the bedrock through which the geothermal fluids passed, namely the Upper Triassic Dajiahe Formation (T3dj), a marine siliceous rock unit, and the Lower Cretaceous Datashanlinchang Formation (K1d), a rhyolite unit. Results indicate that both underlying units are possible Sr sources of the silica in the Wugonglilu sinter. The REE + Y (rare-earth elements and yttrium) patterns of the sinter exhibit significant variability, primarily due to terrestrial detrital contamination. Differential REE + Y contamination by terrestrial detritus was striking in the white and dark laminae/beds of the laminated to thinly bedded sinter. The white laminae/beds, generally less contaminated, were probably formed during the dry season, whereas the dark laminae/beds exhibiting greater detrital contamination were likely formed during the wet season. When excluding the samples strongly contaminated by detritus, the sinter exhibits Y anomalies comparable to Post-Archean Australian Shale (PAAS), and to the adjacent underlying K1d rhyolite and T3dj siliceous rock samples, indicating that these anomalies were not inherited from rocks dominating the reservoirs. Furthermore, the sinter shows a (Ce/Ce*)N range close to that of the underlying marine siliceous rock and rhyolite samples, reflecting that the (Ce/Ce*)N of the sinter is largely inherited from the reservoir rock(s). The overall REE + Y patterns of the sinter range from nearly flat to LREE-depleted, similar to some samples of the K1d rhyolite and T3dj siliceous rock units. However, most samples of the K1d rhyolite and T3dj siliceous rock display (Pr/Tb)N and (Pr/Yb)N higher than many studied sinter samples. This is likely because of the formation of strong HREE-carbonate complexes during groundwater migration. Based on these results, a generalized formation model of the studied sinter system was constructed. This study suggests that integrated sedimentological and geochemical investigations can aid in interpreting the genesis of sinter deposits, in particular the link between sinter deposits and corresponding reservoir rocks.

Distribution of the grappletail dragonfly (Octogomphus specularis), a lake outlet stream specialist at its northern range limit	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												The grappletail dragonfly Octogomphus specularis (Gomphidae) reaches the northern end of its range in Canada and has only seven known occurrences within British Columbia, where its larvae are known only from lake outlet streams. Lake outlet streams provide a unique lotic environment with water from lakes providing high qual-ity seston to filter feeders, favourably warmer water in summer, buffering from variation in discharge, and more stable substrates, in comparison to streams uninfluenced by lakes. We investigated factors that might explain why the distribution of larval grappletails appears to be restricted to lake outlet streams. We sampled the larvae from two outflow streams over one summer to determine their number of age classes and estimate their abundances relative to distance from the lake outlets. We characterized the thermal regime of each lake outlet stream, and quantified the temperature differences between lake outlets and inflow streams. The two lake outlet streams were on average 37 % warmer (4.4 degrees C and 7.2 degrees C) higher than the inflow streams. We found three groupings of larval sizes, indicating a life cycle of three years. In one stream, larval abundance decreased with increasing distance from the lake, but in the other stream there was no pattern of decrease. Our results are consistent with the theory that warmer thermal conditions throughout summer at lake outflow streams provide sufficient degree-days to support development of this species' larvae at the northern end of their global range.

J	Brzáková, M; Hejzlar, J; Nedoma, J				Brzáková, M; Hejzlar, J; Nedoma, J			Phosphorus uptake by suspended and settling seston in a stratified reservoir	HYDROBIOLOGIA					4th International Conference on Reservoir Limnology and Water Quality	AUG, 2002	CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZECH REPUBLIC					Total and abiotic P-uptake rates and P-uptake capacities of seston suspended in the water column and of entrapped settling seston were measured by a radiotracer method in the moderately eutrophic Rimov Reservoir. The study was carried out over one seasonal cycle to investigate whether the settling seston was a sink or a source of dissolved orthophosphate. Total P-uptake rate and P-uptake capacity of both types of seston increased in the epilimnion during the summer months when dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) concentrations <3 μg l(-1) and sestonic C:P ratios > 180 (molar) indicated P-deficiency of phytoplankton. The P-uptake capacity within the flux of particles sinking from the epilimnion in this period corresponded to the removal of 1-4 mg P m(-2)d(-1) from the lower, DRP-rich layers. During the remaining parts of the year and at other depths, the P-uptake rates and capacities were low but always positive. Abiotic uptake represented < 10% of the total uptake in the summer epilimnion samples but nearly 100% in all others. This indicates that biotic P-uptake (apparently by living phytoplankton cells with a depleted cellular P-quota within the settling seston) was dominant in the epilimnion and upper metalimnion while abiotic processes prevailed in the lower layers. Based on these results and on information from the literature we suggest that settling seston possesses this biotic P-uptake capacity generally in all P-limited lakes and that this largely accounts for the observed decrease of sestonic C:P ratios with depth.

Average ice dates in early winter became later: first appearance of ice along shore 2.3 days decade(-1) and complete ice cover 1.2 days decade(-1) while complete ice cover disappeared earlier (5.6 days decade(-1)) as did last ice at the shore (4.3 days decade(-1)). The duration of ice cover decreased by 5.6 days decade(-1) and average ice thickness declined by 6.1 cm decade(-1). The magnitude of these values for individual lakes decreased from eastern to western Poland. This geographic gradient is likely related to regional atmospheric circulation because in winter this part of Europe is strongly affected by continental air, an influence that is greater in the east. A multivariate redundancy analysis (RDA), used in order to examine the dependence of ice measures on lake physical properties and location, indicated longitude and altitude as key factors explaining lake ice dynamics such as the disappearance of ice and ice cover, ice cover duration and thickness. Lake volume and average depth influenced mostly the appearance of ice and ice cover. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Meru, Northern Tanzania	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Climate change and population growth around Mt. Meru experienced lower availability of water for domestic and agricultural uses. Reduction in quantity of water is compounded by lack of information on water quality which could lead to undesired health risks and agricultural effects when such water is used for irrigation. Thus, major ions from 54 different water types (springs, streams, dug wells, boreholes, and lakes) were used to assess hydrogeochemical characteristics and suitability of water for domestic and agricultural purposes. Results showed dominance of the major cation and anion in the order of Na+>K+>Ca2+>Mg2+ and HCO3->CO32->Cl->SO42->NO3->F-, respectively. It is revealed that Mt. Meru is the recharge zone. Geology, water-rock interaction time, and climatic conditions control water chemistry. Major freshwater aquifers were found to be fractured mafic volcanics, breccia, and tuff. Lahars, due to their susceptibility to weathering, were found to host groundwater of low quality. The suitability of water for domestic and irrigation purposes was moderate, in order of lakes<dug wells<boreholes<streams<springs. Fluoride was found to be the major natural contaminant affecting water quality for domestic purposes with mean value of 17.6mg/L, while elevated Na+ (mean=118mg/L), K+ (mean=59mg/L) and HCO3- (mean=390mg/L) relative to other ions were found to affect water quality for irrigation purposes.

Evaluating the Gradual Entrainment Lake Inverter (GELI) artificial mixing technology for lake and reservoir management. Lake Reserv Manage. 00:00-00.Thermal stratification is important to the structure and function of lake and reservoir ecosystems. Yet when lakes undergo eutrophication, thermal stratification can exacerbate water quality problems. As a result, lake management has sometimes involved artificial mixing and destratification, though the available technologies are few and costly. It is therefore important to test the efficacy of new technologies when they arise. Here, we evaluate a lake mixing technology, the Gradual Entrainment Lake Inverter (GELI), which was used to mix Crystal Lake, Wisconsin, a 34ha, 21m deep, dimictic lake during the summer months of 2012 and 2013. To assess the effect of the GELI treatment on thermal regime, we used DYRESM to model thermal conditions in the 2 treatment years but in the absence of treatment. We found GELI treatment slowly reduced stratification and the temperature range of the lake to 4.2 and 5.3 C in each treatment year, on average. Full destratification and oxygenation of the water column prevented fall hypoxia and anoxia. We found efficiency of the GELI averaged 1.9% during treatment, which is higher than efficiencies reported from field applications of bubble plume aeration. We used DYRESM to simulate bubble plume aeration to match the observed destratification from our GELI treatment and estimate aeration would have required 1.4-1.8 times the airflow and power costs of the GELI. Though considerable limitations of the current iteration of this technology exist, these may be reduced in future versions, possibly leading to a practical lake and reservoir management tool.

In the present study, the delta O-18 of shells from the ostracode Bicornucythere bisanensis from Lake Nakaumi, Japan, were examined to identify the bottom salinity changes caused by EASM variations over the past 1700 yr. Four weak EASM periods were identified in Lake Nakaumi: at A.D. 600, 1000, 1350, and 1900. We detected discordance among the centennial-scale EASM variations in Japan and the delta O-18 of stalagmites (delta O-18 stalagmite) in southern China. Furthermore, both total solar irradiance and atmospheric C-14 concentration, which were previously considered to be linked with the centennial-scale EASM variations, were asynchronous with the EASM variations. Conversely, we observed significant positive and negative correlations between the EASM from Japan and the delta O-18(stalagmite) in north-central China, and the relationship was associated with the Asia-Pacific Oscillation (APO) index: centennial-scale EASM periods dominated during the high APO period. These synchronous variations imply that the strength of the EASM variations is tied to temperature gradients between East China and the north-central Pacific Ocean.																			0091-7613	1943-2682				APR	2016	44	4					255	258		10.1130/G37535.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G37535.1													WOS:000372901100006

One core was taken from the upper Salmon River reservoir on the Tug Hill Plateau and the other from Rice Creek near the lake at Oswego. In both instances, portions of the cores containing PCBs and other organochlorines (OCs) lack excess radiogenic Pb-210 and (SC)-S-137, implying depositional ages predating widespread OC commercial production, use, and release. Within each core there is little vertical variation in PCB composition and highly chlorinated congeners dominate the pattern. In addition, the PCB signature is analytically indistinguishable between cores despite collection over 50 km apart. This argues against local sources, and implies deposition and accumulation by processes operating over a substantial area and time period. Transport and introduction of a residual fraction of colloidal-bound PCBs to the sands via tannin-rich riverine waters is proposed. The PCB congener-specific pattern of air samples collected during the spring and summer of 1999 downwind of the lake at two locations (Rice Creek and Sterling) are similar to the sediments and display anomalous concentrations and chlorination with respect to other air sampling localities in the Great Lakes. A link between the residual fraction of PCBs observed in the sediment and air patterns via volatilization from the terrestrial surface is proposed. Elevated PCB concentrations and chlorination in non-radiogenic fluvial sands and air may reflect regional accumulation and weathering processes operating over many decades and/or enhancement of contaminant deposition and partitioning downwind of the lake related to lake-effect precipitation.

This chronology in calendar years, in combination with palynology, enables us to determine the timing. and the magnitude of Lateglacial and Early Holocene environmental changes on land (from 13838 to 10930 vy BP). The palynological diagram has a mean time resolution of 27 vy between samples. This paper establishes for the first time the biozonation for Lake Holzmaar below the Leacher see Tephra. Fifteen pollen subzones grouped in four biozones are defined by cluster analysis. After a period disturbed by microturbidites, only a parr of the Belling is present. Three cold periods have been evidenced by pollen analyses: the Older Dryas (96-vy-long), the Younger Dryas (654-vy-long) and the Rammelbeek phase (237-vy-long). The Allerod (883-vy-long) is bipartite with a first Betula-dominated period followed by a Pinus-dominated one. The Younger Dryas is also bipartite, with first a decrease of winter temperatures along with a change to a more continental climate. It is followed by a drier phase with a second decrease in temperatures. probably this time also affecting summer temperatures. The Preboreal is 702-yr-long. The duration of most phases corresponds to published records, except for that of the Younger Dryas. Cluster and rare-of-change analyses indicate a sharp change in the terrestrial vegetation assemblages that may be caused by a sedimentary hiatus of erosive origin during this cold and dry period. As a result the chronology of Holzmaar has to be revised most likely below the middle of the Younger Dryas. Comparison with the varve record of Meerfelder Maar, a neighbour maar lake, suggests adding 320 vy below 12025 vy.

Lake sediments from a surface and a longer similar to 4 m core contain the sedimentary rhythms of rhodochrosite laminae and volcanic deposits which were identified by nondestructive micro-XRF fluorescence analyses. The three tephra ash layers from the Hokkaido-Komagatake volcano, characterized by peaks of Al, Si, K, Ca, and Ti, correspond to regionally recognized tephras (1640, 1929 and 1996 CE) based on ashfall isopachs and Cs-137, Pb-210 and C-14 ages determined from the two cores. The sedimentation rate showed a drastic change around 1929 CE; similar to 0.3 cm/yr for 1640-1929 CE and similar to 2.7 cm/yr for 1929-2012 CE. The Mn content record of Lake Ohnuma sediments, composed of rhodochrosite laminae, showed a periodic variation with a decadal-centennial scale over the interval 1640-2012 CE. Sediment petrography and hydrochemical measurements suggest that the metastable phase of rhodochrosite was deposited during summer after being precipitated, followed by the crystal growth of rhodochrosite within the anoxic sediments. On the basis of these results, high Mn content is interpreted as an indicator of strengthened summer stratification associated with reduced rainfall runoff. The Ti/Si ratios are representative of the relative abundance of detrital inputs from the watershed. The combined signals of elevated Mn content and Ti/Si ratio for 1935-2012 CE indicate eutrophication and hypoxia in the lake and enhanced land erosion in the watershed, associated with the post-1970s intensive land use such as livestock farming. For 1640-1935 CE, the Lake Ohnuma record shows an antiphase relationship between the Mn content and Ti/Si ratio, which implies that the detrital inputs reflected the strength of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), and the reduced rainfall runoff resulted in weaker mixing, followed by depleted O-2 in the water column. The antiphase variation in Mn content and Ti/Si ratio suggest weak EASM during the Little Ice Age (similar to 1850 CE), followed by strong EASM between 1860 and 1929 CE. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The highest rate of NH3 mineralization occurred at the end of an algal bloom. Total uptake (U) was always less than mineralization (M) mean U/M value 0.02. Total uptake data indicated turnover time for the PN pool was about 4-5 days in June and July but 18-53 days in late July and Aug. Total uptake was highest during early summer when algal biomass was low and specific rates of photosynthesis was highest. Dinitrogen fixation was important only in early summer, and it accounted for 2-90% of total uptake. In Aug. rates of NH3 mineralization was probably high enough to meet the demand of the phytoplankton for N. Input of NH4+ by sewage effluent was 16-150% of the rate of NH4+ uptake.																			0003-9136						1980	88	1					9	23																WOS:A1980JP97900002
J	Rydberg, J; Martinez-Cortizas, A				Rydberg, J.; Martinez-Cortizas, A.			Geochemical assessment of an annually laminated lake sediment record from northern Sweden: a multi-core, multi-element approach	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												We used seven annually laminated (varved) sediment cores from Nylandssjon, a lake in northern Sweden, to assess between-core variation and diagenetic changes at annual resolution. By using several cores, multiple elements and employing principal components analysis (PCA), we also studied how the geochemical composition changed over time, and assessed to what extent these changes were related to variations in the weather. There are between-core differences for aluminum, silica, lead, titanium, zirconium and dry-mass accumulation rate. Diagenesis causes a decrease in bromine, as well as carbon, nitrogen and varve thickness, as reported in previous publications. In spite of anoxic bottom waters phosphorus is not lost from the sediment. In fact, there is an increase in phosphorus concentrations with time. The PCA identified four principal components (PCs). PC-1 accounts for the relative content of mineral and organic material; PC-2 represents mineral-particle grain size; PC-3 reflects phosphorus loading and PC-4 reflects atmospheric pollution. Variations in the weather partly explain the temporal patterns in PC-1 and PC-2: cold winters, i.e. more accumulation of snow, resulted in more mineral than organic matter (i.e. higher PC-1 scores), and increased the relative amount of coarse-grained mineral particles in the sediment (i.e. lower PC-2 scores). Increased spring precipitation had a weak positive effect on the PC-2 scores by promoting the transport of fine-grained material. However, the influence of weather is weak, explaining at most 30 % of the variance, and hence, other factors, e.g. land use and its effect on soil erosion, seem to be more important for the sediment geochemical composition. The importance of land use is also exemplified by an increase in PC-3 scores in the late 1970s, which can be attributed to a shift in agricultural practices that resulted in increased phosphorus loading to the lake. In summary, our findings show that down-core trends are reproducible between cores, but between-core variability and diagenesis need to be considered when interpreting some elements. We also conclude that there is a need to constrain temporal changes in land use before using lake sediments to study changes in weather or climate.

Lake quality monitoring was conducted for 10 months from April 2010 to January 2011 in Lake Hongfeng, southwestern China. Destratification generated strong mixing from surface to bottom waters in the early autumn. The lake water was well-mixed vertically within 3 days and became anoxic within next few months. Total phosphorus concentrations of the whole water column increased by 15-20% as a result of high surface sediment concentrations of total phosphorus and reactive phosphorus. In seasonally stratified lakes, high reactive phosphorus content in sediments may form a larger flux of dissolved phosphorus in the sediment water interface following turnover. Technical measures should be taken to increase dissolved oxygen concentration and control the water circulation in this lake, especially during the cooling period, to weaken the effect of destratification and prevent sediment phosphorus release.																			1660-9336		978-3-03785-912-4				2014	448-453						299	305		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.448-453.299	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.448-453.299													WOS:000338796300059

We present high-resolution, well-dated records of the grain size and carbonate mineralogy from Lake Bayanchagan, northern China, spanning the last 11.5 ka. Grain-size endmember (EM) analysis distinguished four EMs, each linked to different sediment transport processes. EM1 (0.4-0.6 mu m) and EM3 (14-102 mu m) reflect the strength of regional dust activity, whereas EM2 (1.3-31 mu m) represents variations in local hydrodynamic conditions related to lake-level changes and EM4 (68-500 mu m) is associated with local dust activity. Our results show that a high lake level and weakened dust activity occurred during 10-5.8 ka, as indicated by increased EM2 and decreased EM3, respectively. After 5.8 ka, EM2 decreased as the three other EMs increased, and dolomite appeared in the sediments while calcite decreased-indicating both a decline in lake level and strengthened dust activity. The fluctuations in lake level and dust activity are in good agreement with precipitation variations reconstructed from other records, which are in turn correlated to movement of the EASM rainfall belt, in response to temperature changes.

Overlooked importance: The supporting roles of satellite wetlands for waterbirds around the Yangtze-connected lakes, China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Core-satellite wetland networks are widespread in large floodplains, but whether these satellite wetlands provide valuable alternatives for the core wetland remains often unknown in the context of global degradation and loss of natural wetlands. During the wintering season of 2022-2023, we conducted field surveys for waterbirds in two core wetlands (Shengjin Lake and Chao Lake located in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, China) and their surrounding satellite wetlands (aquaculture ponds, paddy fields, reservoirs and natural ponds). The supporting contribution of each satellite wetland was quantified using ratios in terms of individual numbers (SIInd), species richness (SISR), Shannon-Wiener index (SIH) and compositional similarity (SISim) relative to the corresponding core wetland. Differences in supporting contribution were analysed in relation to multi-scale environmental variables. A large number of waterbirds used these satellite wetlands, but the wetlands differed in species compositions. These supporting indices increased with area proportion of open water, landscape connectivity and wetland area, with SISR and SIH also increasing with habitat diversity. SIInd also decreased with shape index. All supporting indices were higher in aquaculture ponds and natural ponds. Generally, the supporting contributions were higher in satellite wetlands surrounding Chao Lake than those of the same types surrounding Shengjin Lake. This study suggests that satellite wetlands provide important compensatory habitats for waterbirds. The core-satellite wetland network operates as an integrated system, and therefore requires attention in management efforts aimed at preserving waterbirds and their habitats.

Phytoplankton population density exhibited a wide seasonal fluctuation with the minimum during monsoon and the maximum during summer, suggesting the possible differential influence of various environmental factors.																			0018-8158					NOV 20	1992	247	1-3					77	86		10.1007/BF00008206	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008206													WOS:A1992KJ25300009
J	Harvey, FE				Harvey, FE			Use of NADP archive samples to determine the isotope composition of precipitation: Characterizing the meteoric input function for use in ground water studies	GROUND WATER												Stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes have been used in ground water studies to investigate recharge, mixing, ground water/surface water interaction, advective-diffusive transport, paleohydrogeologic interactions and to estimate ground water ages. Such studies require that the isotopic composition of precipitation be known, as precipitation is a major input to ground water and surface water systems. As oxygen-18 and deuterium data for precipitation are lacking across much of the United States, there is need to establish additional local meteoric water lines as isotope input functions across the region, as well as to develop better understanding of the isotopic climate linkages that control oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios in precipitation. In the absence of long-term monitoring stations, one possible solution to this problem is to determine the delta O-18 and delta H-2 values of precipitation using archive samples collected at monitoring stations managed by the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP), This study describes and interprets the seasonal delta O-18 and delta H-2 composition of archived precipitation samples collected in eastern Nebraska near the town of Mead during the years 1992-1994. Values for delta O-18 range from -23.6 to -0.7 parts per thousand. Values for delta H-2 range from -172 to 0 parts per thousand. Yearly arithmetic mean delta O-18 and delta H-2 values for the Mead station are -8.1 parts per thousand and -53 parts per thousand, respectively. Weighted yearly means for delta O-18 and delta H-2 were -7.4 parts per thousand and -48 parts per thousand respectively. Mead values show a strong isotopic enrichment between winter and summer precipitation, and a strong delta O-18-T correlation (r(2) = 0.91) for mean monthly values of about 0.5 parts per thousand per degree Celsius. The local meteoric water line for the Mead site is delta H-2 = 7.40 delta O-18 + 7.32. Deuterium excess values suggest that most of the moisture across the region is derived primarily from a Gulf of Mexico source. The results of this study demonstrate that in the absence of long-term monitoring stations such as those operated globally by the International Atomic Energy Association, NADP archive samples can be used to determine the isotopic composition of precipitation, to characterize the local meteoric water line and establish the various climatic relationships, and define the meteoric input function for use in ground water studies.																			0017-467X					MAY-JUN	2001	39	3					380	390		10.1111/j.1745-6584.2001.tb02322.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2001.tb02322.x								11341004					WOS:000168446500010

This event, in which participants swim an estimated 30 km, is very popular; the total number of spectators and participants at the 2002 festival was 15,189. This study, the first pertaining to the LDSMG, aimed to review the effect of the environmental factors at this particular mass gathering event, with mass being defined here as more than 1,000 people, upon the event's patient presentation rate (PPR). This was done to provide improved medical services at this event in future years The study also aimed to collect patient data from the two medical stations (one upstream and one downstream) and analyze the differences between them. In 2002, the number of patients requiring first aid treatment was determined from data gathered on-site. A total of 63 presented at on-site medical stations (PPR, 4.15 per 1,000 attendees), where 14 patients presented to a downstream medical station and 49 to an upstream medical station. The mean age of the patients was 35.46 +/- 15.14 years; ages ranged from 1 to 65 years. Forty-nine of the patients (78%) were male. Fifty-nine patients were treated with medication (3.88 per 1,000 attendees), and two were taken to hospital (0.13 per 1,000 attendees). Injuries sustained included trauma (71%), such as impact, fall, sprain, stabbed laceration and burn, hypothermia (5%), and foreign bodies (3%). The PPR at the LDSMG was related to factors including the presence or absence of seating, whether the event was outdoors or indoors, mobility of the crowd, whether the activity was contained within a boundary, attendance figures, and humidity level. The weather, particularly the relative humidity (81%), was also positively correlated with an increase in the number of presentations at the medical stations.

J	Lloyd, JE				Lloyd, JE			On research and entomological education III:: Firefly brachyptery and wing "polymorphism" at Pitkin Marsh and watery retreats near summer camps (Coleoptera: Lampyridae;: Pyropyga)	FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST												The origin, evolutionary malleability, and sometimes loss of insect wings, gossamer structures whose existence has reshaped the natural world, is one of the moat interesting and enigmatic dramas of insect biology. Lampyridae have long been known for the reduced wings that occur in females of some genera, but in all previously known examples it is a fait accompli, with little or no intraspecific variation. Such variation occurs in and among populations of the little daytime firefly Pyropyga nigricans, and also, among these populations there appears to be variation in sexual involvement in the phenomenon, with brachypterous males also occurring at some localities. This firefly provides an opportunity for students, both in summer classes and as solitary individuals, to study the evolutionary biology of wings, from adaptive significance to sexual selection and population ecology and genetics, to speciation, and in a variety of habitats from strands on northern glacier lakes to southwestern montane stream sides and beyond, to west-coast marshes.																			0015-4040					JUN	1999	82	2					165	179		10.2307/3496569	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3496569													WOS:000081475700002

All the species tested were freezing susceptible and individuals died at their supercooling points. Aquatic species generally exhibited poor supercooling ability (-5.degree. to -9.degree. C) compared with the terrestrial arthropods (-8.degree. to -12.degree. C), of which 4 spp. were high capacity supercoolers (< -20.degree. C). Potential cryoprotectants were in lower concentrations (mostly < 0.1% of fresh weight) in aquatic species than in terrestrial forms, where a 4-component (glycerol, myo-inositol, glucose and trehalose) profile was identified. Summer levels of cryoprotectants were not thought to influence individual supercooling in any species. Considering the annual temperature range for each of the habitat categories (.apprx. 3.degree. for inshore marine, .apprx. 5.degree. for freshwater lakes and .apprx. 62.degree. (-26.5.degree. to +35.8.degree. C) for terrestrial sites), it is unlikely that any of the aquatic invertebrates tested would be at risk from freezing in maritime Antarctic conditions. Most of the terrestrial species avoid lethal freezing by extensive supercooling, but nucleation by food retained in the gut will increase the probability of freezing even in summer acclimatized animals. The high incidence of freezing susceptibility in the Antarctic fauna, especially that of the land, may indicate that supercooling confers a selective advantage on potential colonists over freezing tolerance.																			0007-0262						1984		64					67	76																WOS:A1984TG37200006
J	Zeug, SC; Winemiller, KO; Tarim, S				Zeug, SC; Winemiller, KO; Tarim, S			Response of Brazos River oxbow fish assemblages to patterns of hydrologic connectivity and environmental variability	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Three oxbow lakes with different connection frequencies and an adjacent reach of the middle Brazos River, Texas, were surveyed quarterly from summer 1993 to summer 1996 to examine the effects of hydrology and physicochemical attributes on fish assemblage structure. During flood events, oxbows usually were colonized by about 20 fish species from the river channel, and several fluvial specialists were rarely or never sampled from oxbows. Multivariate analyses of seine samples revealed divergent patterns of assemblage structure during periods of isolation that also were associated with a gradient of maximum water depth, temperature, and conductivity. In contrast, analysis of gill-net samples that targeted large fishes revealed low between-site and temporal variation in assemblage structure among oxbow lakes but significant differences in the structure of oxbow versus channel assemblages. The shallowest oxbow (which dried out with greatest frequency) had the most variable fish assemblage across seasons and was dominated by small colonizing species, whereas deeper oxbows and the river channel tended to have higher species richness and more stable assemblages. Despite large differences in connection frequency and distance from the river channel, the deepest oxbows had the most similar fish assemblage structure across all seasons. Multiple regression analysis suggested that the timing and frequency of flood events (yielding colonization) in the most frequently connected oxbow interact with predator abundance (yielding mortality) to influence the abundance of common lotic-adapted minnows (red shiner Cyprinella lutrensis and bullhead minnow Pimephales vigilax) that periodically dominated the species assemblage of that oxbow after floods. Our results suggest that current hydrologic and geomorphologic dynamics in the middle Brazos River produce oxbow lakes with a range of physical characteristics yielding different disturbance and colonization regimes that strongly influence fish species assemblages.

Holocene temperature history of northern Iceland inferred from subfossil midges	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Holocene temperature history of Iceland is not well known, despite Iceland's climatically strategic location at the intersection of major surface currents in the high-latitude North Atlantic. Existing terrestrial records reveal spatially heterogeneous changes in Iceland's glacier extent, vegetation cover, and climate over the Holocene, but these records are temporally discontinuous and mostly qualitative. This paper presents the first quantitative estimates of temperatures throughout the entire Holocene on Iceland. Mean July temperatures are inferred based upon subfossil midge (Chironomidae) assemblages from three coastal lakes in northern Iceland. Midge data from each of the three lakes indicate broadly similar temperature trends, and suggest that the North Icelandic coast experienced relatively cool early Holocene summers and gradual warming throughout the Holocene until after 3 ka. This contrasts with many sites on Iceland and around the high-latitude Northern Hemisphere that experienced an early to mid-Holocene "thermal maximum" in response to enhanced summer insolation forcing. Our results suggest a heightened temperature gradient across Iceland in the early Holocene, with suppressed terrestrial temperatures along the northern coastal fringe, possibly as a result of sea surface conditions on the North Iceland shelf.

Generally, SO42-, alkalinity, Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations were reduced by runoff and rain then recovered to intermediate levels after the major inputs declined. As expected, a range in responses was evident with lower alkalinity systems showing the greatest changes. The observed changes, however, were consistent with acid loading have depleted alkalinity. In calculating an input-output budget for each lake, we found that changes in Cl-, Na+, and K+ were consistent with atmospheric inputs being the major source as the difference between the expected input and the actual contribution from rain and snow had a mean near zone. There appears to be a significant, .simeq. 45%, watershed source of sulphate that we hypothesize is from dry deposition occurring prior to snowfall and is eluted with the melting process. With refinements to a mass balance approach explaining the watershed source of SO42- and Al, we feel it is possible to predict springtime lake changes given a few chemical and simple morphometric variables.

J	Mahfouzi, M; Hamidian, AH; Kaboli, M				Mahfouzi, Mohsen; Hamidian, Amir Hossein; Kaboli, Mohammad			Edaphic Drivers Influencing Forage Grasslands in Bujagh National Park, Iran	RESOURCES-BASEL												The edaphic and environmental changes in Bujagh grasslands have led to a gradual decline in the wintering waterbird populations in the associated national park. This has particularly affected forage habitats for birds, especially migratory geese. Our aim was to identify the reasons for the loss of habitat quality by examining the structure of the plant community and the edaphic factors that have been instrumental in shifting the grass community pattern to a Rush-Rubus type along the succession route. Bujagh National Park is surrounded by marine, riverine fresh water, and lagoon habitats, and the seasonal floodings of the Sefidrud and Ushmak rivers impact the grassland area along the deltaic pathway to the Caspian Sea. We used the TWINSPAN classification function to extract plant groups and their dominant species. Subsequently, we analyzed land cover changes in the study area over two times (2010 and 2020) to identify alterations in the coverage of main plants and land uses. Following the evaluation of unconstrained ordination methods and the selection of NMDS ordination, we compared the dominant species of groups to the main edaphic predictors. The results indicated that the chemicals and heavy metals in the soil did not play a direct role in the shift from grassland to Rush-Rubus plant type. However, these elements could have a significant impact on the evolution of the structure and the competitive capability among the main dominant species of the grass group. In conclusion, the dominance of the Rush-Rubus type is likely related to other unmeasured environmental and anthropogenic factors that support and enhance their reproductive attributes and herbal proliferation in the grassland territory.

The study included isothermal evaporation at 25 A degrees C in the laboratory and solar evaporation in the ponds at GSL field. Brines increased in density and became moderately acidic (pH ae 5.30) while major ion geochemistry and precipitate mineralogy all showed broad agreement between both systems. Four salt assemblages were identified in the isothermal evaporation experiment: halite -> halite + hexahydrite -> halite + bischofite + carnallite -> bischofite. Alternately, three salt assemblages were recognized in the solar evaporation: halite -> halite + epsomite + carnallite -> halite + carnallite + bischofite. The key difference in salt assemblages between the two systems is attributed to differences in relative humidity and temperature conditions. Although the GSL has deep spring inflow recharge, the high abundance of MgSO4 salts demonstrates that the salt assemblages are similar to normal seawater evaporation. Thus, different proportions of deep spring inflow and river water could form both MgSO4-deficient potassium evaporite and normal seawater potassium evaporites. Therefore, nonmarine water may form diverse potassium evaporite deposits in continental basins when the geological structure as well as hydrogeological and climatic conditions is appropriate.

Drought and management effects on biophysicochemistry in a rapidly-flushed reservoir	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Bellinger BJ, Richter A, Porras A, Davis SL. 2017. Drought and management effects on biophysicochemistry in a rapidly flushed reservoir. Lake Reserv Manage. 34:182198.During a recent drought period, a municipal reservoir was affected by increased duration and magnitude of cyanobacterial blooms, deep water hypoxia, and abundant Hydrilla verticillata growth. We analyzed over 20 yr of water quality data from sources monitoring Lake Austin, Texas, USA, to relate changing hydraulic pulsing rates during periods of water surplus and deficit to system biophysicochemistry. During the drought period, average daily discharges through the reservoir system were significantly reduced to conserve water supply. In response, growing season hydraulic residence times in Lake Austin, typically a run-of-river system with residence of about 10 d, increased 2- to 8-fold. Nutrient loadings to Lake Austin decreased during low discharge, but only total phosphorus (TP) concentrations declined appreciably in the reservoir. Late summer lower flows across years created epilimnetic conditions conducive to cyanobacteria blooms because of stable stratification, water temperatures exceeding 25 C, and nitrate concentration minima with TP and ammonia maxima. Drought-induced discharge reductions promoted earlier onset of warm, stratified waters, and lower hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations. The physicochemical changes coupled with longer hydraulic residence altered the timing of algal bloom initiation, duration, and peak, and quadrupled the probability of cyanobacterial bloom occurrence. The largest cyanobacteria blooms were observed when growing season discharges were consistently below 20 m(3)/s (i.e., hydraulic residence time >2 weeks). Concomitantly, the nonnative macrophyte hydrilla rapidly spread in the warm, reduced flow conditions. By linking flushing rates to reservoir stratification and potential phytoplankton bloom magnitude, our results will allow managers to anticipate summer water quality conditions.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2018	34	2					182	198		10.1080/10402381.2017.1384770	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2017.1384770													WOS:000434445700007
J	Yu, YL; Xue, LH; Yang, LZ				Yu, Yingliang; Xue, Lihong; Yang, Linzhang			Winter legumes in rice crop rotations reduces nitrogen loss, and improves rice yield and soil nitrogen supply	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												Intensive irrigated rice-wheat crop systems have caused serious soil depletion and nitrogen loss in the Tai Lake region of China. A possible solution is the incorporation of legumes in rice because legumes are a source of nitrogen. There is actually little knowledge on the impact of legumes on rotation, soil fertility, and nitrogen loss. Therefore, we studied the effect of five rice-based rotations, including rice-wheat, rice-rape, rice-fallow, rice-bean, and rice-vetch, on soil nitrogen, rice yield, and runoff loss. A field experiment was conducted in the Tai Lake region from 2009 to 2012. Crop residues from rape, bean, and vetch were used to partially replace chemical fertilizer in rice. Results show that replacing 9.5-21.4 % of mineral nitrogen fertilizer by residues maintained rice yields of rice-rape, rice-bean, and rice-vetch rotations, compared to the rice-wheat reference. Moreover, using legumes as a winter crop in rice-bean and rice-vetch combinations increased rice grain yield over 5 %, and increased rice residue nitrogen content by 9.7-20.5 %. Nitrogen runoff decreased 30-60 % in rice-rape, rice-bean, and rice-vetch compared with rice-wheat. Soil mineral nitrogen and microbial biomass nitrogen content were also improved by application of leguminous residues.																			1774-0746	1773-0155				JUL	2014	34	3					633	640		10.1007/s13593-013-0173-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-013-0173-6													WOS:000337089100008

The aim of this study was to evaluate the dynamics of the limnological conditions of Catalao Lake, an Amazon floodplain lake. Thus, some of the main limnological environment variables (O-2, temperature, pH, nutrient, electrical conductivity) of the Catalao Lake were analyzed under temporal and spacial scales. The study was conducted between November/2004 and August/2005. Sampling excursion were carried out every three months; one excursion for each of the four different hydrological periods (low water, rising water, high water and falling water). Sampling points were chosen so that it could be obtained a gradient of the distance from Negro River. Limnological profiles in Catalao Lake showed generally acidic to slightly alcaline water, with low levels of dissolved oxygen and low concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorous. The Negro River seems to exert the main influence during the rising water period, while the Solimoes River is the principal controlling river during peak water. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) grouped the seasonal collections by hydrological period, showing the formation of a north-south spatial gradient within the lake in relation to the limnological variables. Multivariate dispersion analysis based on distance-to-centroid method demonstrated an increase in similarity over the course of the hydrological cycle, as the lake was inundated in response to the flood pulse of the main river channels. However, the largest spatial homogeneity in the lake was observed in the epilimnion layer, during the falling water period. The daily analysis of variation indicated an oligomitic pattern during the years in which the lake was permanently connected to the Negro River. Although Catalao Lake receives large quantities of both black water from the Negro River and sediment-filled water from the Solimoes River, the physical and chemical characteristics of the lake are more similar to those of the Solimoes (varzea lake) than the Negro (blackwater lake).

Metazooplankton of the plain reservoir during climate warming: Biomass and production	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												The structure and dynamics of biomass and production of various trophic groups of metazooplankton in the Rybinsk Reservoir before climate warming (until 1977) and during the warming period have been analyzed on the basis of long-term (1956-2010) observations. In 2004-2010, the values of biomass (0.9 g/m(3)) and production (54 kcal/m(2)) in the reservoir pelagial were lower than at the peak of metazooplankton development in the 1980s-1990s (1.2 g/m(3) and 73 kcal/m (2), respectively). However, the former values were higher by a factor of 1.5 (0.6 g/m(3) and 37 kcal/m(2), respectively) than before climate warming. As of recently, the productivity of metazooplankton in the reservoir corresponds to the level of eutrophic waterbodies. As a result of warming, the duration of the period of mass development of summer zooplankton has increased for about 2 weeks, and the maxima of biomass and production are registered in the second half of summer (August). The efficiency of the energy transfer from the phytivorous to predatory plankton and the rate of the matter cycling in zooplankton of large plain reservoirs in relation to changes in the trophic status of their ecosystems under climate warming are discussed.

J	Cyr, H				Cyr, Helene			Wind-driven thermocline movements affect the colonisation and growth of Achnanthidium minutissimum, a ubiquitous benthic diatom in lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Benthic algae form a major component of primary production in shallow waters and are an important component of lake food webs. I tested the effects of thermocline movements and bathymetric slope on the colonisation and population development of a ubiquitous and often dominant benthic diatom, Achnanthidium minutissimum. 2. Sampling sites were positioned along the upwind and downwind shorelines of an elongated 22 km 2 lake basin, on a range of bathymetric slopes (1-16%). A first set of substrates was deployed at eight sites during early stratification (June 19, 2004) and were sampled after 4, 11 and 20 days and 5.5 and 11 weeks to compare colonisation, establishment, early growth rate and density of mature populations. The second set of substrates was deployed at 16 sites in mid-summer (July 26) and was sampled after 5.5 weeks. The density of A. minutissimum and their average cell length were measured in all samples. Thermocline movements were calculated using a 3D hydrodynamic model, which was calibrated offshore in the lake basin and validated at each sampling site. 3. Achnanthidium colonised the open substrates very rapidly. Initial cell densities increased with increasing thermocline movement, especially along shallow bathymetric slopes. These results suggest an inverse relationship between thermocline-induced nearshore turbulence and bathymetric slope. 4. The density of early colonisers was reduced by 30-95% during the establishment period (411 days after substrate deployment), suggesting that Achnanthidium needs time to attach firmly to the substrate and is vulnerable to disturbances during that period. Achnanthidium established most efficiently at upwind nearshore sites exposed to more thermocline movement. 5. The early growth rate of Achnanthidium in nearshore areas was negatively related to mean water temperature, a likely surrogate for nutrient availability at the sediment-water interface. 6. The density of Achnanthidium in mature populations was positively related to thermocline movements and showed a negative interaction with bathymetric slope early in the stratification period, but not later in summer. These results suggest that physical forces associated with thermocline movements interact differently with the bottom in nearshore areas as the season progresses and as the water-column stabilises. 7. The size of Achnanthidium cells increased during settlement and early population growth, peaked in early July at most sites and decreased over the rest of the summer. This common pattern of seasonal change in Achnanthidium cell sizes suggests a strong factor synchronising its life cycle across the whole lake basin. 8. Thermocline movements over nearshore substrates clearly affect the colonisation and population development of A. minutissimum. These results support the idea that wind-driven physical forces are a major factor structuring nearshore habitats in lakes, even in the lower littoral zone, and that benthic organisms should distribute themselves in a predictable way around lake basins.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				OCT	2016	61	10					1655	1670		10.1111/fwb.12806	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12806													WOS:000386021300004
J	Hatch, JJ				Hatch, JJ			Changing populations of Double-crested Cormorants	COLONIAL WATERBIRDS												The Double-crested Cormorant (Phalanocorax auritus) has a wider range in North America than any of the five other breeding cormorants and is the only species to occur extensively in the interior as well as on the coasts. Breeding birds are currently known in 40 of the 50 States of the United States, all 10 Canadian Provinces, and in Mexico, Cuba and the Bahamas. There are six more-or-less distinct populations, and five subspecies have been described but their significance is unclear because measurements overlap substantially and the distributions of crest characters are poorly known. Scattered archeological and historical accounts indicate that numbers in the Interior and Atlantic populations declined during the 19th century, and subsequent increases have been facilitated, but not fully explained, by dam-building and by declines in persecution. Numbers increased front the 1920s into the 1950s when pesticides had major impacts. The Interior populations fell to low points about 1970 and the Atlantic population ceased growing. The species was recognized as of ''Special Concern'' in several states during this period. For the past 20 years numbers have been increasing rapidly in most areas, although information on nonbreeding birds is very sparse. Particularly large increases are reported for the subspecies auritus, both the Interior population centered in the Canadian Prairie Provinces and Great Lakes (220,000 pairs) and the Atlantic population on the Northeast Coast (96,000 pairs). These birds migrate to winter in the South, chiefly in coastal areas from Texas to North Carolina, where there is considerable overlap of birds from diverse breeding areas. The numbers of the resident populations in Florida and the Caribbean comprising subspecies floridanus and heuretus (14,000 pairs) are poorly known and are probably declining. The status of the small population in Alaska (cincinatus) (3,000 pairs) is not known. On the West Coast (albociliatus) (31,000 pairs) the numbers in Canada and the United States are increasing rapidly, but the status of Mexican populations is unclear. The migrations of the populations in the Pacific are not well characterized.																			0738-6028						1995	18				1		8	24		10.2307/1521520	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1521520													WOS:A1995TM97000002

Cold curation of pristine astromaterials: Insights from the Tagish Lake meteorite	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												The curation and handling of volatile-bearing astromaterials is of prime importance in current and future plans for sample return missions to targets containing organic compounds, ices, or other volatile components. We report on the specific curation constraints required for the preservation of the Tagish Lake meteorite, a C2 ungrouped chondrite that contains significant concentrations of organic matter, including compounds of prebiotic interest or volatile in character, and which was recovered from a frozen lake surface a few days after its fall. Here, we review the circumstances of the meteorite's handling, its complement of intrinsic and contaminant organic compounds, and an unusual reaction between some of the specimens and the Al foil in which they were enclosed. From our results, we derive the requirements for curation of the meteorite, and describe a specialized facility that enables its curation and handling. The Subzero Facility for Curation of Astromaterials consists of a purified Ar glove box enclosed within a freezer chamber, and enables investigations relevant to curation of samples at or below -10 degrees C. We provide several recommendations based on insights obtained from the commissioning and initial use of the facility that are relevant to collection of freshly fallen meteorites, curation of volatile-bearing meteorites and other astromaterials, and planning and implementation of curation plans for future sample return missions to volatile-bearing targets.					; Herd, Christopher/IYJ-9105-2023	Herd, Christopher/0000-0001-5210-4002; Simkus, Danielle/0000-0002-8272-623X; 													1086-9379	1945-5100				MAR	2016	51	3					499	519		10.1111/maps.12603	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.12603													WOS:000372556800004
J	Zhang, DE				Zhang, De'er			Test Calibration of the Paleoclimatic Proxy Data with Chinese Historical Records	ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH												The calibration of paleoclimate proxies is one of the key problems in the study of paleoclimate at present. Historical documentary records of climate are suitable for calibration on dating and the climatic implication of the proxy data in a climatological sense. A test calibration on correcting the Delingha tree ring precipitation series using Chinese historical documentary records shows that among the 44 extreme dry cases in 1401-1950 AD, 42 cases (or 95.5%) are believable. Thus the long series of Delingha rings-denoted precipitation is highly reliable. Another test to validate the monsoon intensity proxy data based on the Zhanjiang Huguangyan sediments using historical records indicates that the years of Lake Maar Ti content series-designated winter monsoon intensities are entirely opposite to historical documents depicted years of harsh winters in 800-900 AD. As a result, serious doubt is raised about the climatic implication of this paleo-monsoon proxy series.																			1674-9278					MAR 25	2011	2	1					38	42		10.3724/SP.J.1248.2011.00038	http://dx.doi.org/10.3724/SP.J.1248.2011.00038													WOS:000434523000005

Comparison with a survey from 1932, showed vegetation cover is similar to the past, maintaining high cover to depths of 2.8 m despite a period of eutrophication between about 1960 and 1990. Species dominance shifted, however, from small charophytes to larger species like Potamogeton pectinatus. We explain interannual vegetation changes by weather conditions. Such changes were observed in several species, most notably in Chara canescens. This annual species seems to be favoured by extensive winter ice cover. The diaspore reservoir and the germination success of submerged macrophytes do not mirror their frequency in the vegetation, but rather reflect life form strategies. Small oospores, mainly of annual charophytes, represented > 97% of all diaspores but very few Chara oospores germinated. The numerous Tolypella oospores probably originated from a discrete period with high abundance during the 1950s and have completely failed to germinate. Angiosperm seeds are larger and less frequent but have higher germination success, especially Ruppia seeds. In conclusion, charophytes are outcompeted by larger angiosperms due to the combined effect of moderate eutrophication and climate change.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2016	778	1					121	136		10.1007/s10750-016-2655-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-016-2655-4													WOS:000379645500010

Increase imperviousness and the setup of various networks (drinking water, sewer systems) lead to the modification of the hydrological cycle components and of water pathways in those catchments. In this paper, we assess the relevance of the The Peri-Urban Model for landscape MAnagement (PUMMA) to represent the hydrological cycle in the Mercier sub-catchment (6.8 km(2)), located close to Lyon city, France, with 10% of artificialized areas. The model is tested in more rural conditions than in a previous application to the Chaudanne neighbour sub-catchment (2.2 km(2)), characterized by 24% of artificialized areas. The model mesh is based on an object-oriented approach. It is composed of polygons, as derived from a detailed land use map (forest, agricultural fields, urban cadastral units and lakes). The river network is composed of the natural river, ditches and the rain water network. All the units are interconnected for surface and sub-surface flow transfer, and river routing. Model parameters are specified using in situ information or the results of previous studies, without any calibration, in order to assess the relevance of various functioning hypotheses. The model is run for two contrasted years: 2008 (wet) and 2009 (dry) with a variable time step for rainfall and an hourly time step for reference evapotranspiration. Simulated discharge is compared to measurements at the outlet and statistical performance criteria are computed. The model is able to represent the contrast between higher values of base flow in winter and very low flow in summer. Annual runoff volume underestimated (-21%) in 2008 and overestimated (+10%) in 2009.																					978-90-824846-0-1				2015							5553	5560																WOS:000398996205078

Extreme daily loads: role in annual phosphorus input to a north temperate lake	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Changes in fertilizer use, manure management or precipitation may alter the frequency of episodes of high nutrient runoff and thereby affect annual nutrient loads and total nutrient concentrations of lakes. We developed an empirical, stochastic model for daily P loads and used the model to project annual P loads and summer total P concentrations in Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, USA. Daily P loads (8,250 daily observations) were fit closely by a three-part gamma distribution composed of days with low, intermediate, and high P loads. High P load days happen when heavy rains or snowmelt occur on soil with abundant P, often as a result of manure or inorganic fertilizer application. In Lake Mendota, on average 29 days per year accounted for 74 % of the annual load. Simulations showed that median annual P loads increased linearly with the frequency of high P load days. However, the upper quantiles of the annual P load distribution increased more steeply than the median. Increases in the number of high P load days per year also increased summer concentrations of P in the lake. Thus increases in the frequency of high P load days due to larger precipitation events or increased application of fertilizers and manure may worsen widespread problems caused by P pollution of lakes in this agricultural watershed.					; Carpenter, Stephen/AAQ-6404-2020	Booth, Eric/0000-0003-2191-6627; Kucharik, Christopher/0000-0002-0400-758X; 													1015-1621	1420-9055				JAN	2015	77	1					71	79		10.1007/s00027-014-0364-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-014-0364-5													WOS:000347149700007

Evaluation of water quality is normally based on time consuming and expensive in situ measurements. Remotely sensed data is an efficient alternative for field monitoring because of its spatial and temporal coverage. In this study, remote sensing imagery combined with in situ measurements of water quality were used to estimate an empirical relationship between water surface reflectance and water quality parameters including water turbidity and Total Suspended Sediment (TSS). Surface reflectance values is obtained from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Aqua satellite. The empirical equations were derived from data over summers 2011-13 and show high correlation coefficients of equal to 0.83 and 0.87 for TSS and turbidity respectively. The validity of the proposed equations was tested for summer 2014 data. The NRMSE for prediction of measured data by the proposed equations are 0.36 and 0.3 for TSS and turbidity. Remotely sensed data was also used to produce water quality maps to improve our understanding of the spatiotemporal variations of Fox River turbid plume. The proposed approach can be extended to other coastal regions of Great Lakes and provide a framework to study pollution transportation in coastal areas.

J	Lehtonen, H				Lehtonen, H			Does global warming threat the existence of Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus (Salmonidae), in northern Finland?	ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Predicted global warming is expected to raise the water temperatures 2-6 degrees C after doubling of atmospheric CO2. As an extreme coldwater fish species the Arctic charr appear to avoid water temperatures above 16-18 degrees C. Arctic charr lives in Finland only in the mountain lakes of northernmost parts of the country and in some deep lakes of eastern Finland. Charr is most abundant at high altitudes. The global warming is expected to threaten first populations living in low altitude shallow lakes in which no thermal summer stratification occurs. Climatic warming will increase duration of high temperatures and thermal stratification in deep lakes. This indicates that Arctic charr will spend longer periods in minimum thermal habitats. Assuming that no factors other than temperature will change in future climates, reductions in summer habitat will probably lead to noticeable reductions in many charr populations. Populations living in deep lakes will survive better than those living in shallow lakes provided that the water quality of these lakes does not deteriorate.																			1125-0003	1748-5851					1998	65			S			471	474		10.1080/11250009809386868	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11250009809386868													WOS:000079306600082

In this study we use data from the KTYX WSR-88D, ERA5 reanal-ysis, New York State Mesonet, and Ontario Winter Lake-effect Systems (OWLeS) field campaign to examine how these factors influence lake-effect characteristics with emphasis on the region downstream of Tug Hill. During an eight-cool-season (16 November-15 April) study period (2012/13-2019/20), total radar-estimated precipitation during lake-effect periods increased gradually from Lake Ontario to upper Tug Hill and decreased abruptly where the Tug Hill escarpment drops into the Black River valley. The axis of maximum precipitation shifted poleward across the northern Black River valley and into the northwestern Adirondacks. In the western Adirondacks, the heaviest lake-effect snowfall periods featured strong, near-zonal boundary layer flow, a deep boundary layer, and a single precipitation band aligned along the long-lake axis. Airborne profiling radar observations collected during OWLeS IOP10 revealed precipitation en-hancement over Tug Hill, spillover and shadowing in the Black River valley where a resonant lee wave was present, and precipitation invigoration over the western Adirondacks. These results illustrate the orographic modulation of inland-penetrating lake-effect systems downstream of Lake Ontario and the factors favoring heavy snowfall over the western Adirondacks.

Apart from the influence of food, both vertebrate and invertebrate predation pressures seem to have an effect on D. hyalina population dynamics. Enclosure experiments were designed to assess the relative importance of both types of predation. After the summer crash, D. hyalina reached higher numbers in the fishless enclosures than in the lake despite of high predation pressure upon juveniles by Acanthocyclops robustus. Fish predation upon the largest individuals, especially large egg bearing females, was responsible for the lower fertility of the open water population when compared with the enclosure population. In the enclosures an increase in tail spine length was observed. The longer tail spine probably offered protection from copepod predation, allowing at least some of the juveniles to coexist with their potential predator and reach the adult stage, less susceptible to copepod predation.

Third, a Bayes factor hypothesis test was used to quantify the evidence for the null hypothesis against a default one-sided alternative. Only seven out of 60 Bayes factors indicated non-anecdotal support in favour of the alternative hypothesis (BF10 > 3), whereas 51 Bayes factors indicated at least some support for the null hypothesis.

ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Introgression might be exceptionally common during the evolution of narrowly endemic species. For instance, in the springs of the small and isolated Cuatro Cienegas Valley, the mitogenome of the cichlid fish Herichthys cyanoguttatus could be rapidly introgressing into populations of the trophically polymorphic H. minckleyi. We used a combination of genetic and environmental data to examine the factors associated with this mitochondrial introgression. A reduced representation library of over 6220 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the nuclear genome showed that mitochondrial introgression into H. minckleyi is biased relative to the amount of nuclear introgression. SNP assignment probabilities also indicated that cichlids with more hybrid ancestry are not more commonly female providing no support for asymmetric backcrossing or hybrid-induced sex-ratio distortion in generating the bias in mitochondrial introgression. Smaller effective population size in H. minckleyi inferred from the SNPs coupled with sequences of all 13 mitochondrial proteins suggests that relaxed selection on the mitogenome could be facilitating the introgression of "H. cyanoguttatus" haplotypes. Additionally, we showed that springs with colder temperatures had greater amounts of mitochondrial introgression from H. cyanoguttatus. Relaxed selection in H. minckleyi coupled with temperature-related molecular adaptation could be facilitating mitogenomic introgression into H. minckleyi.					; León, Francisco/AAH-9391-2019; Meyer, Axel/C-9826-2009	Garcia de Leon, Francisco Javier/0000-0003-2323-2560; Meyer, Axel/0000-0002-0888-8193; Hulsey, C.

The year-class strength correlated positively with the mean summer water temperature from June to September during the first year of life. Negative correlations between the year-class strength and wind indices were found with the southerly and southwesterly winds in July. These winds explained 35% (F = 4.53, P = 0.027, n = 20) and the mean temperature alone 40% (F = 9.89, P = 0.007, n = 17) of the total variation in year-class strength. When the exceptionally weak year-class in 1971 was excluded from the analysis, the corresponding values were 62% for the winds (F = 6.50, P = 0.007, n = 19) and 55% for the mean summer temperature alone (F = 16.92, P < 0.001, n = 16). No correlation existed between the year-class strength and water level, water salinity or water transparency.					; Lappalainen, Jyrki/IAM-3496-2023	Lappalainen, Jyrki/0000-0002-4631-3788; 													0003-455X						1995	32	4					411	419																WOS:A1995TP62800006
J	Robichaud, A				Robichaud, Andrew			Frozen Over: Making Ice and Knowing Nature in Nineteenth-Century America	ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY												In the nineteenth century, the United States became the center of an emerging international ice trade and industry, which created new forms of labor in cultivating and harvesting ice on ponds, lakes, and rivers. The emergence of inexpensive commoditized ice shaped markets and commerce in numerous ways, as ice became valuable as both ballast and as a source of cooling and refrigeration. But developing this commodity, and creating elements of this cold chain, required new knowledge of ice. The workers who harvested and cultivated ice in the 1800s knew winter nature through their labor. Over time, large-scale harvesters collected this knowledge and developed extensive tools and disassembly-line harvesting systems to create an industry with low wages and high volume by the late 1800s. An in-depth exploration of this labor reveals ways in which nineteenth-century Americans knew ice and cold in distinct ways-including through forms of labor and consumption. Over time, the knowledge that workers and consumers of ice possessed was largely lost in the twentieth century, as "artificial" ice production and refrigeration became divorced from winter landscapes of frozen ponds, lakes, and rivers.																			1084-5453	1930-8892				JUL 1	2022	27	3					519	546		10.1086/720343	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720343													WOS:000830524000008
J	Margaryan, VG				Margaryan, V. G.			ASSESSMENT OF THE FEATURES OF EXTREME LOW TEMPERATURES OF THE SURFACE AIR LAYER IN THE LAKE SEVAN BASIN (ARMENIA)	PROCEEDINGS OF THE TULA STATES UNIVERSITY-SCIENCES OF EARTH												The study is aimed to assess the patterns of spatio-temporal distribution of the extreme low temperatures of the Lake Sevan basin, their impact on the surrounding natural landscape landscape. As the source material, observations of daily data on the extremes of the minimum temperatures of the surface air layer at seven meteorological stations of the basin for the entire period (1891-2018). The methods used are mathematical- statistical, extrapolation, analytic, correlation, cartographic. A correlation was obtained between the average annual and annual absolute minimum values, as well as between the annual absolute minimum temperatures and the height of the area above sea level. The obtained relationships can be used to assess the thermal conditions of unexplored or little studied territories. As a result, a map of the spatial distribution of the annual absolute minimum temperatures of the surface air layer in the lake Sevan basin was compiled. Main conclusions. An analysis of the trend lines of temporary changes in the absolute minimum air temperatures shows that, at all weather stations currently operating in the basin, the absolute minimum temperatures tend to increase both monthly and annual. Moreover, the smallest temporary changes are observed in the summer months. It also turned out that in the basin, the annual number of days with temperatures below -20 degrees C tends to decrease. This natural dynamics indicates that in the studied territory, softening of winters is recorded in terms of temperatures. As a result, it turns out that it is possible to grow more heat-loving crops that were not previously grown in the basin. On the other hand, as a result of this, there is a decrease in the water supply in the snow, which in turn leaves its mark on water resources.

J	Sun, WW; Zhang, EL; Chen, R; Shen, J				Sun, Weiwei; Zhang, Enlou; Chen, Rong; Shen, Ji			Lacustrine carbon cycling since the last interglaciation in northeast China: Evidence from n-alkanes in the sediments of Lake Xingkai	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Organic carbon mineralization and storage in the inland water bodies is an important component of global carbon cycling. However, the mechanisms influencing carbon cycling in the inland water bodies remain uncertain. In this study, n-alkane data from a sediment core spanning the last glacial-interglacial cycle from Lake Xingkai in northeast China, were analyzed to determine response of regional carbon cycling to climate change. Prior to MIS 1 the sedimentary n-alkanes were mainly derived from terrigenous higher plants and helophytes in the wetland. By contrast, non-photosynthetic bacteria are probable major alternating source of sedimentary n-alkanes during MIS 1. The n-alkanes in the sediments are mainly influenced by the variations of lake level and deposition of mineral dust. The total organic carbon content (TOC) and TOC-normalized middle- and long-chain n-alkane concentrations increased during glacial times and decreased during interglacial periods, reflecting higher rates of organic matter decomposition under warmer climatic conditions. The temperature dependence of lacustrine organic matter mineralization suggests that the carbon burial potential of lakes in northeast China will decrease in the future as global warming intensifies.					sun, weiwei/GQG-8925-2022														1040-6182	1873-4553				JUL 20	2019	523						101	108		10.1016/j.quaint.2019.07.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2019.07.004													WOS:000486450700011
J	Sillitoe, RH				Sillitoe, Richard H.			Epithermal paleosurfaces	MINERALIUM DEPOSITA												Many active volcanic-hydrothermal and geothermal systems are characterized by distinctive surface and near-surface landforms and products, which are generated during discharge of a spectrum of fluid types under varied conditions. Remnants of most of these products are preserved in some of their less-eroded, extinct equivalents: epithermal deposits of high-sulfidation (HS), intermediate-sulfidation (IS), and low-sulfidation (LS) types. Steam-heated alteration occupying vadose zones and any underlying silicified horizons formed at paleogroundwater tables characterize HS, IS, and LS deposits as do hydrothermal eruption craters and their subaerial or shallow sub-lacustrine breccia aprons and laminated infill. Although rarely recognized, HS, IS, and LS systems can also contain finely laminated, amorphous silica sediments that accumulated in acidic lakes and mud pots and, exclusive to HS systems, in hyperacidic crater lakes. In contrast, silica sinter and more distal carbonate travertine are hot spring discharge products confined mainly to LS and IS settings, as both form from near-neutral-pH liquids. Hydrothermal chert deposition and sediment silicification can take place in shallow, lacustrine rift settings, also largely restricted to LS and IS deposits. These surface and near-surface hydrothermal products are typically metal deficient, although mercury concentrations are relatively commonplace and were formerly exploited in places. Nonetheless, sinters, hydrothermal eruption craters, and silicified lacustrine sediments may contain anomalously high precious metal values; indeed, the last of these locally constitutes low-grade, bulk-tonnage orebodies. The dynamic nature of epithermal paleosurfaces, caused by either syn-hydrothermal aggradation or degradation, can profoundly affect deposit evolution, leading to either eventual burial or telescoping of shallower over deeper alteration +/- precious metal mineralization. Formational age, tectonic and climatic regime, hydrothermal silica content and texture, and post-mineralization burial history combine to determine the preservation potential of paleosurface products. Proper identification and interpretation of paleosurface products can facilitate epithermal precious metal exploration. Proximal sinters and hydrothermal eruption craters may mark sites of concealed epithermal mineralization, whereas paleogroundwater table silicification and steam-heated blankets can be more widely developed and, hence, less diagnostic. Epithermal precious metal deposits may immediately underlie paleosurface features but are commonly separated from them by up to several hundred vertical meters, especially in the case of IS deposits. Furthermore, the tops of concealed, particularly IS epithermal orebodies in any particular district, irrespective of whether or not paleosurface features are preserved, can also vary by several hundred vertical meters, thereby imposing an additional exploration challenge. Precious metal contents of paleosurface products are unreliable but nonetheless potentially useful guides to concealed deposits. However, sub-paleosurface geochemical anomalism, particularly for arsenic and antimony, may indicate proximity to subjacent ore.																			0026-4598	1432-1866				OCT	2015	50	7					767	793		10.1007/s00126-015-0614-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00126-015-0614-z													WOS:000362288800001

The data are used to describe long-term environmental and climatic changes. The focus is on reconstructing the Holocene conditions particularly in the Zackenberg area. In addition, this chapter provides an overview of the archaeological evidence for prehistoric occupation of the region. The Zackenberg area has been covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet several times during the Quaternary. At the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, about 22,000 years BP), temperatures were much lower than at present, and only very hardy organisms may have survived in the region, even if ice-free areas existed. Marked warming at around 11,700 years BP led to ice recession, and the Zackenberg area was deglaciated in the early Holocene, prior to 10,100 years BP. Rapid early Holocene land emergence was replaced by a slight transgression in the late Holocene. During the Holocene, summer solar insolation decreased in the north. Following deglaciation of the region, summer temperatures probably peaked in the early to mid-Holocene, as indicated by the occurrence of a southern beetle species. However, the timing for the onset of the Holocene thermal maximum is rather poorly constrained because of delayed immigration of key plant species. During the thermal maximum, the mean July temperature was at least 2-3 degrees C higher than at present. Evidence for declining summer temperatures is seen at around 5500, 4500 and 3500 years BP. The cooling culminated during the Little Ice Age that peaked about 100-200 years ago. The first plants that immigrated to the region were herbs and mosses. The first dwarf shrubs arrived in Northeast Greenland prior to 10,400 years BP, and dwarf birch arrived around 8800 years BP. The first people arrived about 4500 years BP, but the region was depopulated several times before the last people disappeared some time after 1823 AD, perhaps as a consequence of poor hunting conditions during the peak of the Little Ice Age.

J	Pearson, C; Moore, P; Edwards, S				Pearson, Christopher; Moore, Philip; Edwards, Stuart			GNSS assessment of sentinel-3A ECMWF tropospheric delays over inland waters	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH												Over land and inland waters satellite radar altimetry is being used in numerous applications including polar mass change, ice topography, river and lake heights and soil moisture. To achieve high accuracy altimetric range measurements, geophysical corrections are applied including the Zenith Total Delay (ZTD) which varies spatially, temporally and with altitude. Over oceans, the wet tropospheric component of the ZTD is usually derived from onboard radiometers. However, over land, the radiometer return is saturated and the zenith wet and dry tropospheric delays are derived separately as output of a meteorological model such as that processed by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations located near Sentinel-3A ground tracks and correcting for any height difference the ECMWF model is compared to the ZTD estimated from GNSS data, quantifying the likely error for inland water and land applications. We found that, globally, there is a median bias of -3 mm between the ECMWF model and GNSS values with median absolute deviation (MAD) of 7.3 mm but with clear spatial and temporal variations. Spatially, ZTD differences are greatest within the tropics with MAD values exceeding 11 mm, over double that of points within the Arctic Circle (<5 mm). Temporally, the ECMWF model differs from GNSS values more during summer months. Northern Hemisphere summer (June-August) has an approximately 60% larger MAD than December-February with the summer MAD approximately 20% smaller in the Southern Hemisphere. Assessment of the tropospheric error is quantified for the largest river catchments for application to inland water heights. The close proximity of altimetric data, GNSS receiver and inland water gauges on the Amazon and Orange rivers and Lake Ontario confirms the preference for GNSS derived ZTD. Overall, the altimetric community can be reassured that the tropospheric contribution to the error budget for inland water applications is less generally than 20 mm at 1 sigma in all major catchments.

J	VINER, AB; KEMP, L				VINER, AB; KEMP, L			THE EFFECT OF VERTICAL MIXING ON THE PHYTOPLANKTON OF LAKE ROTONGAIO (JULY 1979 - JANUARY 1981)	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The seasonal succession of the major phytoplankton species is described for Lake Rotongaio, a small crater lake which flows into Lake Taupo via a short channel. The dynamics of only the 4 most abundant species are described. Expressed as cell numbers, Anabaena oscillarioides dominated in the warmer and stratified periods from Nov. 1979 to April 1980 and again from Sept. 1980, to the end of the observation period in Jan. 1981. During destratification the diatoms Synedra ulna and Cyclotella meneghiniana attained maximum numbers. The green alga Chlorella vulgaris peaked immediately before the Sept. 1980 stratification. When expressed as cell volumes, the diatoms were always greater than Anabaena. These seasonal changes can largely be explained as being long-term versions of short-term population fluctuations seen during thermal stratification. These are interpreted to have been responses to vertical mixing with resulting changes in the availability of light for photosynthesis in the epilimnion. During thermal stratification, Anabaena is buoyed upwards; the diatoms sink to the hypolimnion. To compensate for such losses the growth rates of the diatoms must have been of an approximately similar magnitude to the growth rates leading to their winter maxima. The Synedra population decline may hve been influenced by low temperature in mid-winter. Nutrient recirculation did not appear to be an important factor for phytoplankton biomass. There is little evidence for any important resources; the phytoplankton dynamics and biomass appear to be mediated directly by external events and not, in any important way, by internally generated conditions.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1983	17	4					407	422		10.1080/00288330.1983.9516016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1983.9516016													WOS:A1983SM09400007
J	SANFORD, BV				SANFORD, BV			STRATIGRAPHIC AND STRUCTURAL FRAMEWORK OF UPPER MIDDLE ORDOVICIAN ROCKS IN THE HEAD LAKE-BURLEIGH FALLS AREA OF SOUTH-CENTRAL ONTARIO	GEOGRAPHIE PHYSIQUE ET QUATERNAIRE												Field investigations in the Head Lake-Burleigh Falls area of south-central Ontario, that focused mainly on the Covey Hill(?), Shadow Lake, Gull River and Coboconk formations along the Paleozoic escarpment, provided clear evidence of faulting. Observed and inferred structural deformation, coupled with facies changes within the Shadow Lake and lower Gull River, point to a succession of basement movements during the Phanerozoic. These range from Hadrynian-Early Cambrian, through Middle Ordovician to post-late Middle Ordovician times. Some of the earlier movements (Hadrynian-Early Cambrian to late Middle Ordovician) appear to be coincident with, and probably related to, plate tectonic events and the associated Taconian orogeny that were in progress along the southeastern margins of the North American continent. Post-Middle Ordovician block faulting, on the other hand, may have been triggered by any number of epeirogenic events related to late stage Taconian, Acadian or Alleghanian orogenies in Late Ordovician to Carboniferous times, or possibly to rifting associated with continental break-up and initiation of seafloor spreading processes in the early Mesozoic.																			0705-7199						1993	47	3					253	268		10.7202/032956ar	http://dx.doi.org/10.7202/032956ar													WOS:A1993MY44400002

The middle Miocene Horse Spring Formation and red sandstone unit allow for detailed stratigraphic, chronostrati-graphic, and structural analysis for better understanding the geologic history of extension in this region. We present new data from the White Basin and Lovell Wash areas (Nevada) to interpret the evolution of faulting, basin fill, and paleogeography. We conclude that tectonics strongly influenced sedimenta-tion and hypothesize that climate may have played a secondary but important role in creating stratigraphic variations. Deposited from 14.5 to 13.86 Ma, the microbialitic Bitter Ridge Limestone Member of the Horse Spring Formation, the stratigraphically lowest unit in this study, records a widespread shallow and uniform lake which had moderate and steady sedimentation rates, both of which were controlled by a few faults. The persistent lake was broken up by fault reorganization followed by deposition of the highly variable fluvial-lacustrine facies of the Lovell Wash Member from 13.86 to 12.7 Ma. During this time, faulting shifted from the northeast-trending, oblique normal left-lateral White Basin fault to the northwest-trending, normal Muddy Peak fault and other smaller northwest-trending faults. The lower and middle portions of the red sandstone unit, 12.7-11.4 Ma, record an increase in the sedimentation rate of basin fill near the Muddy Peak fault as well as the return to widespread lacus-trine conditions. Sedimentation and faulting slowed during deposition of the uppermost red sandstone unit, but some deformation occurred post-11.4 Ma. This study records basin-fill evolution including variations in depositional environments laterally and vertically, documents changes in the location and magnitude of faulting, supports earlier work that hypothesized faulting pro-ceeded in discrete westward steps across the Lake Mead area, and helps constrain the paleogeographic and tectonic evolution of the region.

Navigating snowscapes: scale-dependent responses of mountain sheep to snowpack properties	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Winters are limiting for many terrestrial animals due to energy deficits brought on by resource scarcity and the increased metabolic costs of thermoregulation and traveling through snow. A better understanding of how animals respond to snow conditions is needed to predict the impacts of climate change on wildlife. We compared the performance of remotely sensed and modeled snow products as predictors of winter movements at multiple spatial and temporal scales using a data set of 20,544 locations from 30 GPS-collared Dall sheep (Ovis dalli dalli) in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, Alaska, USA from 2005 to 2008. We used daily 500-m MODIS normalized difference snow index (NDSI), and multi-resolution snow depth and density outputs from a snowpack evolution model (SnowModel), as covariates in step selection functions. We predicted that modeled snow depth would perform best across all scales of selection due to more informative spatiotemporal variation and relevance to animal movement. Our results indicated that adding any of the evaluated snow metrics substantially improved model performance and helped characterize winter Dall sheep movements. As expected, SnowModel-simulated snow depth outperformed NDSI at fine-to-moderate scales of selection (step scales <112 h). At the finest scale, Dall sheep selected for snow depths below mean chest height (<54 cm) when in low-density snows (100 kg/m(3)), which may have facilitated access to ground forage and reduced energy expenditure while traveling. However, sheep selected for higher snow densities (>300kg/m(3)) at snow depths above chest height, which likely further reduced energy expenditure by limiting hoof penetration in deeper snows. At moderate-to-coarse scales (112-896 h step scales), however, NDSI was the best-performing snow covariate. Thus, the use of publicly available, remotely sensed, snow cover products can substantially improve models of animal movement, particularly in cases where movement distances exceed the MODIS 500-m grid threshold. However, remote sensing products may require substantial data thinning due to cloud cover, potentially limiting its power in cases where complex models are necessary. Snowpack evolution models such as SnowModel offer users increased flexibility at the expense of added complexity, but can provide critical insights into fine-scale responses to rapidly changing snow properties.					hebblewhite, mark/G-6164-2013; Gurarie, Eliezer/AGI-0958-2022; Nolin, Anne/KHX-9645-2024; Brinkman, Todd/B-3578-2013; boelman, natalie/K-9789-2015	Boelman, Natalie/0000-0003-3716-2372; Eitel, Jan/0000-0003-1903-3833; Hebblewhite, Mark/0000-0001-5382-1361; Wells, Adam/0000-0001-9675-4963; LaPoint, Scott/0000-0002-5499-6777													1051-0761	1939-5582				OCT	2018	28	7					1715	1729		10.1002/eap.1773	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eap.1773								30074675					WOS:000446009900004

During the rainy season it collects stormwater from the surrounding catchment areas as well as other urban runoff water. During summer, Loch Logan frequently experiences algal blooms. The system can be classified as eutrophic due to high dissolved reactive phosphate (PO4-P) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations. Nitrogen is probably the limiting factor to algal growth. The consequences of the eutrophication are algal blooms, oxygen depletion, fish kills, excessive macrophyte growth, odour problems and extreme oscillations occur in physical and chemical parameters.																			0378-4738	1816-7950				JUL	2005	31	3					385	392																WOS:000231086100014

Zabuye Salt Lake is the only one in Tibet, China that has so far realized the industrialization of lithium extraction from the salt lake brine. The green and low-cost lithium extraction technology by using the salinity-gradient solar pond (SGSP) adopted has always been paid much attention by lithium-related practitioners and researchers. In order to improve the lithium yield and grade of a single crystallization pond, the cross-year brine mixing method can be used to increase the initial temperature and CO32- concentration of the raw brine for making the SGSP. The premise is to ensure that the summer brine with low Li+ and high CO32- prepared in the previous year could be stored safely for overwintering with a minimal change in brine composition, for use in brine mixing in February and March of the next year, which can be realized by using the SGSP. In this paper, two experiments of brine storage for overwintering were carried out in the Zabuye mining area, Tibet in 2020 and 2021 by using the large-scale SGSP with an area of nearly 4000 m2. The results show that during the operation of the SGSP in winter, the brine temperature in the lower convective zone (LCZ) can still rise to more than 20 degrees C and remain relatively stable, indicating that the coverage of surface ice layer not only has an effect of heat preservation and insulation on the SGSP, but also plays a positive role in the thermal storage capacity of the SGSP. The vertical distributions of brine temperature, density and salinity in the pond showed the ideal gradient curves increasing from top to bottom, and the concentrations of Li+ and CO32- in the brine only decreased slightly. The structure of the salinity-gradient layer tended to stabilize faster when the brine filling depth was larger, but the boundary between the upper convective zone (UCZ) and the non-convective zone (NCZ) was relatively blurred. It is completely feasible to store the brine for overwintering by using the SGSP in the Zabuye mining area, and the experimental results could be directly scalable to larger industrial applications. It can not only provide high-quality raw brine for cross-year brine mixing, but also reduce the pressure of brine production, and a small amount of lithium mixed salt collected is helpful to increase the output of a single crystallization pond. Additionally, the potential challenges of maintaining the SGSP system during extreme winter conditions are described, and effective measures and suggestions are proposed to make the technology feasible in diverse climates.

In this study, observed temporal temperature distributions in shallow sediment of Lake Taihu (Eastern China) based on three-depth sensors at 14 sites throughout 2016 were used to assess temporal water exchange patterns. Results show that temporal temperature in shallow sediments differed with sampling sites and depths and the temperature amplitudes also clearly shrunk as the offshore distance increasing. Exchange fluxes estimated using the VFLUX 2 model based on temperature amplitude show that alternating-direction temporal flow exists in the eastern zone of Lake Taihu with averages of -13.0, -0.6, and 3.4 mm day(-1) (negative represents discharging into the lake) at three nearshore sites (0.5, 2.0, and 6.0 km away from the shoreline, respectively). Whereas downwelling flow occurred throughout almost the entire year with averages of 37.7, 23.5, and 6.6 mm day(-1) at the three southern nearshore sites, respectively. However, upwelling flow occurred throughout almost the entire year and varied widely in the western zone with averages of -74.8, 45.9, and -27.0 mm day(-1) and in the northern zone with averages of -76.2, -55.3, and -51.1 mm day(-1). The estimated fluxes in the central zone were relatively low and varied slightly during the entire year (-15.1 to 22.5 mm day(-1) with an average of -0.7 mm day(-1)). Compared with the sub sensor pair (at 5 and 10 cm), the estimated hyporheic fluxes based on the top sensor pair (at 0 and 5 cm) varied within wider ranges and exhibited relatively larger values. Effects of upwelling flow at the western and northern zones need to be paid attention to on nearshore water quality particularly during winter and spring seasons. Estimated flow patterns at the four zones summarily reflect the seasonal water interaction near the sediment surface of Lake Taihu and are beneficial to improve its comprehensive management. Thermal dispersivity usually used for estimating the thermal diffusivity is more sensitive for upward hyporheic flux estimating even if with a low flux. Temperature amplitude ratio method can be used to estimate the exchange flux and suitable for low flux conditions (either upwelling or downwelling). A better evaluation of the exchange flux near inclined nearshore zones might need an optimized installation of temperature sensors along with the potential flow path and/or a vertical two-dimensional model in the future.

Exclusion of Ring-billed Gulls (Larus delawarensis) from recreational beaches using canid harassment	CONDOR												Ring-billed Gull (Larus delawarensis) populations have dramatically increased throughout their geographic range with the largest concentrations in the Great Lakes region of Canada and the United States. Large populations of gulls cause conflict with humans at recreational beaches, where their effects on human health and safety include bacteria contamination from gull feces. We used border collies to harass and exclude gulls from beaches in summer 2012 and 2013, then measured gull numbers and Escherichia coll. Dogs were effective at reducing gull numbers by 56-76% during continuous and noncontinuous dog treatment periods. Levels of E. coli were lower on dog-treated beaches, but only during the first half of the summer. Mixed modeling analysis showed presence of dogs was a strong predictor of gull numbers and E. coil levels, with variation among dogs, possibly related to age. Noncontinuous use of dogs, applied within an integrated beach management framework, can provide a nonlethal method for reducing gull use and E. coli levels at recreational beaches.

The Yenisei River provides the largest river inflow to the Arctic Ocean, heavily affected by the cold climate. Data on the ice cover in the Arctic great rivers are insufficient due to the absence of a river ice database with high spatiotemporal resolution. In this study, the daily river ice coverage (RIC, defined as the fraction of river ice pixels to river pixels in a grid cell) in the Yenisei River was estimated from 2002 to 2021 in a 12.5 x 12.5 km grid, by utilizing a cloud removal method for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Based on Landsat imagery reference, the RIC correlations (Pearson's R) were 0.77, 0.84, and 0.97 for three separate validation regions. Over the past 20 years, 82.8 % of the grid cells experienced a decreasing ice cover, with 21.9 % significant at the 0.05 level. The mean winter air temperature was the key predictor (R-2 = 0.48, P < 0.01), better than the accumulated negative air temperature (R-2 = 0.42, P < 0.01). The spatial distribution of winter RIC exhibited a latitudinal gradient (R-2 = 0.64, P < 0.01). River ice responded to temperature variation in a non-linear way, depending on latitude, with high sensitivity in the southern part of the watershed. In Lake Baikal in the river basin, the distribution of ice cover was also affected by stream inflows. The results provide a comprehensive insight into the spatial-temporal variations of the Yenisei River and explore the key factor of changes in river ice, enhancing our ability to understand the response of Arctic great rivers to climate change.

Trace Organics in Arizona Surface and Wastewaters	CONTAMINANTS OF EMERGING CONCERN IN THE ENVIRONMENT: ECOLOGICAL AND HUMAN HEALTH CONSIDERATIONS	ACS Symposium Series				238th National Meeting of the American-Chemical-Society (ACS)/American-Chemical-Society (ACS) Symposium on Emerging Contaminants, Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs), and Organohalogens in Wastewater and Municipal Biosolids	AUG 16-20, 2009	Washington, DC	Amer Chem Soc, Div Chem Toxicol, Amer Chem Soc, Env Chem Inc				To investigate the occurrence of trace organic compounds (TrOCs) in waters throughout Arizona, 26 compounds (pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), and artificial sweetener) were analyzed in samples from surface waters, drinking water treatment plants (WTPs), wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and a groundwater recharge site during September 2007 to July 2009. Samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). TrOCs were prevalent during this study, as they were found in 95% of the samples collected (n>100). The most frequently detected compounds in surface waters were oxybenzone, caffeine, and sucralose. The total concentration of TrOCs varied seasonally with the highest concentration detected during summer. For WTPs, the majority of TrOCs detected in surface water were also identified in WTP raw waters and sedimentation effluent. High TrOC concentrations were detected in raw wastewater, and certain compounds (e.g. oxybenzone, ibuprofen, DEET, etc.) exhibited an increasing trend during summer. WWTP processes were shown to remove 11 of 26 compounds with up to 98% efficiency. Sucralose and sulfamethoxazole were dominant compounds (>60%) in WWTP effluent. Pharmaceuticals were also present in the ground water system of the Phoenix water supply area (<5 ng/L). Overall, the top six compounds detected were a) by frequency: oxybenzone, caffeine, sucralose, DEET, sulfamethoxazole, and acetaminophen; and b) by concentration: oxybenzone, caffeine, sucralose, DEET, sulfamethoxazole, and dilantin. Results of this study demonstrate the occurrence of TrOCs in the Phoenix drinking water system. Other sources of TrOCs that might impact drinking water, such as lakes, WWTP recharging sites, and landfill sites, need to be investigated for overall water resource management in Arizona.

Northward expansion of the westerlies over glacial southeastern Australia: evidence from semi-arid lunette dunes, temperate basalt plains, and wind modelling	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												It has long been hypothesized that the last glacial maximum (LGM) oversaw cold, arid, windy climates across southern Australia, and that these were driven by intensification and northward expansion of mid-latitude westerly circulation. Moreover, it was recently suggested that Australia experienced an extended LGM which began several millennia before the global peak. Aeolian sedimentary deposits provide key evidence for these hypotheses, and climate modelling an alternative means to test them. As yet, however, combined approaches to reconstructing glacial environments on the continent are scarce. Here we provide new evidence for westerly wind regimes across glacial southeastern Australia. We confirm active transverse lunette deposition at c. 29 ka and c. 23-19 ka in the semi-arid Willandra Lakes, and identify aeolian sand incursions to Spring Creek on the temperate Western Victorian Volcanic Plains from c. 29 ka. The Spring Creek deposits contain a surprising quantity of sand-sized quartz given the basalt setting, which we propose to be allochthonous and likely transported some distance. The site lies more than 50 km east and south of dunefields which were active at the same time and may have contributed sediment via long distance transport. We investigate the hypothesis for northward glacial expansion of westerly winds by combining our sediment records with aeolian particle transport simulations. We find that LGM near-surface winds were dominated by stronger, more focussed westerly air flow across southeastern Australia, compared with presently more diffuse wind regimes. Our results suggest stronger potential for LGM eastward distal sand transport onto the basalt plains, coeval with enhanced aeolian activity in the semi-arid Australian dunefields. Our combined reconstruction of aeolian deposition and trajectory modelling confirms the extended LGM hypothesis and indicates a northward migration of westerly winds over southeastern Australia during this period.

Cores were incubated in a continuous flow system at variable temperatures. After the experiments, the cores were segmented and phosphorus was fractionated to determine the origin of the released phosphorus. Phosphorus release rates were temperature dependent; in the order of 100-200 mg P m-2 day-1 at typical summer temperatures. These gross release rates have been supported by other investigations. Phosphorus was released from the loosely sorbed and the iron bound fractions. Organic bound phosphorus is also considered to be important for the overall flux of phosphorus in the sediment, especially during the summer when a large proportion of the released phosphorus due to algal sedimentation is returned to the sediment as organic bound phosphorus. Phosphorus was mainly released from 2-6 cm depth; the upper 1-2 cm of the sediment seem to be in a state of equilibrium and did net not release phosphorus.

Ecological Risk Assessment and Metal Pollution in Water and Fish in a Mediterranean Lagoon: A Case Study of Edku Lake, Egypt	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												In the current study, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) was utilized to assess the presence of heavy metals (HMs) in the water of Edku Lake and their accumulation in the muscles of edible fish, primarily Nile tilapia. The results obtained from LIBS were validated using the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) technique, specifically on iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al). The average concentrations of various metals, including Fe, Al, manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), chromium (Cr), and cadmium (Cd) as determined by ICP, during winter and summer were found to be in the following ranges (in mu g/l): Fe (266.67-474.44), Al (333.33-1184.44), Mn (7.11-8.23), Zn (9.00-8.66), Cr (5.00-23.23), and Cd (2.49-1.20, 1.26-0.52). For the fish muscle samples, the average metal content (in mu g/g) was ranked in the following order: Al (9.43-5.57) > Fe (8.37-6.51) > Zn (0.9) > Mn (0.5-0.57) > Cr (0.08-0.1) > Cd (0.01-0.007). The obtained analytical results demonstrated good consistency between the LIBS and ICP methods. However, for the very low-concentration metals, such as Mn, Cr, and Cd in water, as well as all metals in fish, this level of agreement was not observed. The results of the present work revealed that Edku Lake faces challenges with poor water quality due to heavy metal pollution; however, the levels of metals in Nile tilapia remain within safe limits for human consumption. The LIBS technique is promising for monitoring heavy metals in water samples, but its sensitivity needs further improvement to effectively detect low concentrations of elements in biological tissues.

Lawrence; Cheng, Hai; Wang, Xianfeng			Paleoclimate and growth rates of speleothems in the northwestern Iberian Peninsula over the last two glacial cycles	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Speleothem growth requires humid climates sufficiently warm to stimulate soil CO2 production by plants. We compile 283 U/Th dates on 21 stalagmites from six cave systems in the NW coast of Spain to evaluate if there are patterns in stalagmite growth that are evidence of climatic forcing. In the oldest stalagmites, from marine oxygen isotope stage (MIS) 7-5, growth persists through the glacial period. Hiatuses and major reductions in growth rate occur during extreme minima in summer insolation. Stalagmites active during the last interglaciation cease growth at the MIS 5-4 boundary (74 ka), when regional sea-surface temperature cooled significantly. During MIS 3, only two stalagmites grew; rates were highest between 50 and 60 ka during the maximum in summer insolation. One stalagmite grew briefly at 41 ka, 36.5 and 28.6 ka, all during warm phases of the Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles. A pronounced Holocene optimum in stalagmite growth occurs from 9 to 6 ka. The cessation of most growth by 4.1 ka, coincident with broad increases in aridity over the Mediterranean and areas influenced by the North African Monsoon, suggest that regions such as NW Spain, with dominant Atlantic moisture sources, also experienced increased aridity at this time.

J	Habermehl, MA				Habermehl, M. A.			Review: The evolving understanding of the Great Artesian Basin (Australia), from discovery to current hydrogeological interpretations	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												The Great Artesian Basin (GAB) in Australia underlies semi-arid and arid regions across 1.7 million km(2) or one-fifth of Australia. The basin's groundwater resources were discovered around 1880 and their development allowed pastoral activities, homestead and town water supplies, and petroleum and mining ventures to exist. The GAB is a multi-layered confined aquifer system, with aquifers in Jurassic and Cretaceous continental sandstones and intervening confining beds of siltstone and mudstone of the constituent Eromanga, Surat and Carpentaria sedimentary basins. The basin is up to 3,000 m thick and forms a large synclinal structure, uplifted and exposed along its eastern margin and tilted southwest. Recharge to the exposed aquifers occurs in the eastern margin, an area of relative high rainfall. The western margin in Australia's arid centre receives minor recharge. Regional groundwater flow is towards the southern, south-western, western and northern margins. Flowing artesian springs discharge in the southwest margin and have produced carbonate mounds. Although lateral groundwater movement dominates, vertical upwards leakage is considered important. Potentiometric surfaces of the Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous aquifers are still above ground level throughout most of the basin, though pressure drawdowns of up to 100 m have been recorded in recent decades in highly developed areas, and consequently some artesian water boreholes and springs have ceased flowing. Government borehole rehabilitation programs have led to groundwater pressure recovery in some areas. This paper outlines the history of GAB exploration, scientific investigations (hydrogeology, hydrochemistry, isotope hydrology, groundwater modelling) and management, summarising the recent knowledge on the GAB.																			1431-2174	1435-0157				FEB	2020	28	1			SI		13	36		10.1007/s10040-019-02036-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-019-02036-6													WOS:000512005300002
J	Pandey, G; Venkatram, A; Arunachalam, S				Pandey, Gavendra; Venkatram, Akula; Arunachalam, Saravanan			Accounting for plume rise of aircraft emissions and shoreline meteorology enhances AERMOD's description of concentrations measured around Los Angeles airport	JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION												The Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT), developed by the FAA, is used to analyze the environmental impact of airport activities on air quality and noise near airports. AEDT incorporates AERMOD to estimate concentrations resulting from aircraft emissions, which possess horizontal momentum as well as buoyancy. The current version (v23132) of AERMOD incorporates plume dynamics associated with such emissions as an ALPHA option. AERMET, AERMOD's meteorological processor does not account for the meteorology of the land-water interface that is likely to be important for airports located on the shorelines of lakes or oceans. An approach to include these effects in AERMOD was previously developed. This study examines the impact of including plume rise and shoreline effects in AERMOD by evaluating model estimates of NOX and SO2 with corresponding measurements made during the Los Angeles Airport Air Quality Source Apportionment Study (AQSAS) in the winter and summer of 2012. The performance statistics resulting from this model evaluation suggest that the inclusion of plume rise of aircraft emissions and shoreline effects on meteorological inputs is likely to improve AERMOD's ability to estimate the impact of airport emissions on surrounding air quality.Implications: Because airport emissions, particularly those from aircraft, affect local air quality, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the use of dispersion models such as AERMOD to assess compliance of air quality regulations when potential expansions of airport activity are planned. The current regulatory version of AERMOD does not include aircraft-specific plume rise and shoreline-related meteorological processes, which affect the dispersion of airport emissions. The preliminary evidences presented in our previous work suggest that the incorporation of these effects will enhance AERMOD's ability to estimate NOX and SO2 concentrations associated with airport emissions. These enhancements are beneficial not only for policy-making and regulatory compliance but also for promoting sustainable development near airports and protecting public health.

All groups of zooplankton responded to prolonged summer elevated temperatures by increasing their abundance. During the breakdown of the stable stratification of Lake Shira (2015-2016), zooplankton abundance increased on average by a factor of two and amounted to 9x10(5) inds./m(2) in the water column for copepods. That increase coincided with similar responses of other components of the lake's mixolimnion ecosystem, whose biomasses increased approximately two-fold during that period. After the reestablishment of the meromixis, the abundance of zooplankton decreased to previous values. Thus, the abundance of zooplankton is largely determined by weather (the effect of temperature) and ecological factors (mixing regime).

We evaluated the influence of hepatic Se concentrations on lipid and protein reserves, organ masses, tissue health, and oxidative stress of greater scaup wintering at western Lake Ontario during December-March, 2006-2007. Although we detected Se at elevated levels, all greater scaup with physical abnormalities (13 of 73 birds) had Se concentrations below the acute health problem threshold established formallards (33 mu g/g). Neither organ masses, protein reserves, nor measures of oxidative stress were influenced by hepatic Se concentrations, whereas lipid reserves varied positively with hepatic Se concentrations. Results suggest that hepatic Se concentrations at levels recorded in our study do not affect body condition or physical health of greater scaup. (C) 2012 The Wildlife Society.

While gut microbiota is believed to play a role in helping birds adapt to environmental changes, research on how extreme weather impacts their gut microbiota and how these microbial communities respond to such conditions has been limited.Methods 16S rRNA gene sequencing was utilized to investigate the gut microbiota of common cranes (Grus grus) wintering at Poyang Lake from 2020 to 2023, with a particular focus on their response to extreme drought conditions on both inter-annual and monthly timescales.Results The results revealed that extreme drought conditions substantially impact gut microbiota, with inter-annual water-level fluctuations exerting a more pronounced impact on microbial community structure than that of inter-monthly fluctuations. Notably, a significant decline in bacterial diversity within the gut microbiota of common cranes was observed in the extreme drought year of 2022 compared with other years. Monthly observations indicated a gradual increase in gut microbial diversity, coinciding with relatively minor water-level changes. Key taxa that responded to drought included the Enterobacteriaceae family and Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species. Additionally, functional genes related to carbohydrate metabolism, the phosphotransferase system, and the two-component systems were significantly enriched during the extreme drought year. These functions may represent adaptive mechanisms by which the gut microbiota of common cranes respond to drought stress.Discussion This research provides novel insights into the temporal variability of gut microbiota in wintering waterbirds, underscoring the significant impact of climatic fluctuations on microbial communities. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the ecological and functional responses of gut microbiota to extreme weather events, which is crucial for the conservation and management of migratory bird populations in the face of climate change.

However, a lack of high-resolution paleoclimate archives and effective climate proxies has hitherto limited reconstruction of the spatiotemporal evolution of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). In this study, the ratio of the meteoric cosmogenic Be-10 (Be-10(met)) to silicate-weathered Be-9 in annually laminated sediments from Maar Lake Xiaolongwan (NE China) was utilized to reconstruct EASM precipitation over the past two millennia. We find two apparent humid periods during the transitions of the Dark Age Cold Period-Medieval Climate Anomaly (DACP-MCA, -700 CE) and MCA -Little Ice Age (MCA-LIA, -1250 CE). The interval of these two humid periods is consistent with previous proposition of similar to 500-yr oscillations of EASM in Northeast Asia. Although there are some phase variabilities, the pattern of temporal variation from 400 to 1600 CE are synchronous with other regional climate records from the EASM region. However, the spatial pattern shows an anti-phase synchronization between the EASM and the transition zone between the EASM and the Indian summer monsoon (ISM), revealing a "dry northeastern and wet southwestern" mode during the MCA. The climate change fluctuations derived here from Be-10(met)/Be-9 in maar lake sediments are more straightforward than Chinese cave delta O-18 records and global temperature anomalies, providing a unique climate proxy for detecting variations of paleo-precipitation flux in specific regions. The overall slight weakening of EASM is consistent with a long-term cooling trend, which is likely regulated by solar irradiance. The apparent decrease of EASM during the transition from MCA to LIA is interpreted as the main control of explosive volcanic eruptions. The internal fluctuations and the spatiotemporal variability of precipitation are likely associated with the integrated effect of ISM and El Nino-Southern Oscillation. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

We estimated the recruitment of Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis), one of the most important species in coastal fisheries in northern Baltic Sea, and examined the factors that determine perch recruitment success. We hypothesized that perch spawning population biomass and summer water temperature would increase perch recruitment, with potential density dependence, while the effect of the population size of pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) would be negative. Different forms of general stock-recruitment functions, with and without density dependence, and with and without water temperature and pikeperch population size as environmental factors were fitted to long-term (1981-2014) stock assessment data of perch and pikeperch in the Archipelago Sea, southwestern coast of Finland. Perch spawning stock biomass (ages 5-14), water temperature in June-July and pikeperch stock size (ages >= 1) at spawning year best explained variation in perch recruitment. The results supported the predictions: perch recruitment increased with spawning stock in density-dependent manner, pikeperch effect on perch recruitment was negative and summer temperature effect was positive suggesting environmentally affected competitive interaction between these two percids.

Pb is a contaminant released during cassiterite extraction, and it stands out for its high toxicity. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of flood pulse on Pb dynamics in four fish species with different feeding habits (Cichlapleiozona: carnivorous, Mylossomaduriventre: herbivorous, Prochilodus nigricans: detritivorous, and Serrasalmus rhombeus: piscivorous) over four hydrological periods in Puruzinho Lake (Brazilian Amazon), which receives water from the Madeira River. The risk assessment for daily Pb intake through the consumption of these fish by the local riverside population was also carried out. Fish species were sampled during four Amazonian hydrological periods: rising water, high water, falling water, and low water. Pb and stable isotopes (delta N-15 and delta C-13) measurements were carried out on fish muscle. The flood pulse had the same effect on Pb concentrations of all the fish species regardless of their feeding habits, as we found a nonsignificant interaction between these variables. The Pb in fish muscle increased in the flood season (rising and high water) and decreased in the dry season (falling and low water). The Pb concentration in fish increased significantly with their trophic level (delta N-15), evidencing the occurrence of biomagnification of the element along the trophic chain (R-2 = 0.24). The main food source of the herbivorous fish (delta C-13) was very distinct from that of the others, which had a large overlap in their values. Regarding risk assessment, the daily Pb intake through consumption of the herbivorous species during high water (17.82 +/- 19.68 mu g.day(-1)) exceeded the limit determined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of 12.5 mu g.day(-1), representing a health risk to the riverside population of Puruzinho Lake.

J	Hart, RC				Hart, RC			Phytoplankton dynamics and periodicity in two cascading warm-water reservoirs from 1989 to 1997 - taxonomic and functional (C-S-R) patterns, and determining factors	WATER SA												The composition and abundance of distinctive planktonic autotrophs ( ca 60 taxa) were examined at roughly fortnightly intervals in two sizeable reservoirs ( Midmar and Albert Falls) on the uMngeni River, KwaZulu- Natal, between 1989 and 1997. The dynamics of community structure and abundance were examined in both taxonomic and functional ( C- S- R) terms in relation to physical abiotic variables ( thermal stratification, light climate, water level) and biotic influences of predation (zooplankton abundance). Annual periodicity was exhibited by most taxa apart from Cryptomonas, although patterns tended to be indistinct and inter-annual repeatability was generally weak - in line with year-to- year and between-system environmental variability. Water level fluctuation, with concomitant change in stratification intensity and hydraulic mixing and accompanying changes in water clarity associated with suspended sediment levels was clearly a major ( direct and indirect) determinant of phytoplankton composition and abundance. The influence of top-down controls as inferred from phytoplankton- zooplankton relationships was fundamentally different in the two reservoirs - potentially stimulatory in Midmar, but clearly regulatory in Albert Falls, where episodic collapses of Daphnia populations resulted in chlorophyll values well into the eutrophic level range. In addition to annual patterns, changes in chlorophyll content implied progressive long-term changes in trophic status, especially in Albert Falls, with the emergence of various 'new' taxa (and/ or higher peak densities of others). Consideration of phytoplankton dynamics in terms of functional groups offers certain advantages over conventional phyletic taxonomic analyses, although algal response forecasting by either approach appears potentially constrained by hydrological variability. Site-specific bio-monitoring, possibly using new rapid technologies, is likely to be necessary for ongoing management purposes until predictive capabilities under regionally characteristic conditions improve. Despite limitations, functional classification proffers faster advances to this end than conventional taxonomic appraisal.																			0378-4738					JAN	2006	32	1					81	92																WOS:000235130000011

To clarify the role of migratory birds in viruses spread in Poyang Lake, we investigated the microbiome of 250 wild bird samples from 19 species in seven orders. The bacterial and viral content abundance and diversity were preliminarily evaluated by Kraken2 and Bracken. After de novo assembly by Megahit and Vamb, viral contigs were identified by CheckV. The reads remapped to viral contigs were quantified using Bowtie2. The bacterial microbiome composition of the samples covers 1526 genera belonging to 175 bacterial orders, while the composition of viruses covers 214 species belonging to 22 viral families. Several taxonomic biomarkers associated with avian carnivory, oral sampling, and raptor migration were identified. Additionally, 17 complete viral genomes belonging to Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Dicistroviridae, Picornaviridae, and Tombusviridae were characterized, and their phylogenetic relationships were analyzed. This pioneering metagenomic study of migratory birds in Poyang Lake, China illuminates the diverse microbial landscape within these birds. It identifies potential pathogens, and uncovers taxonomic biomarkers relevant to varied bird habitats, feeding habits, ecological classifications, and sample types, underscoring the public health risks associated with wintering migratory birds.

F.; Chen, Deliang			Performance of the WRF Model at the Convection-Permitting Scale in Simulating Snowfall and Lake-Effect Snow Over the Tibetan Plateau	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												This study investigated the performance of the Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) model at 4-km horizontal grid spacing in simulating precipitation, 2 m air temperature (T2), snowfall, and lake-effect snow (October 4-8, 2018) over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Multiple simulations with different physical parameterization schemes (PPSs), including two planetary boundary layer schemes (Yonsei University and Mellor-Yamada-Janjic), no cumulus and multi-scale Kain-Fritsch, two land surface models (Noah and Noah-MP), and two microphysics schemes (Thompson and Milbrandt), were conducted and compared. Compared with gauge observations, all PPSs simulate mean daily precipitation with mean relative errors (MREs) of 27.7%-53.6%. Besides, spatial correlation coefficients (SCCs) between simulated and observed mean daily precipitation range from 0.56 to 0.71. For simulations of T2, all PPSs perform similarly well, even though the mean cold biases are up to about 3 degrees C. Meanwhile, all PPSs exhibit acceptable performance in simulating spatial distributions of snow depth, snow cover, and snowfall amount, with SCCs of 0.37-0.65 between simulations and observations. However, the WRF simulations significantly overestimate snow depth (similar to 0.4 cm mean error) and snowfall amount (MREs >372%). The Milbrandt scheme slightly outperforms the other PPSs in simulating snow-related variable magnitudes. Due to their inaccurate temperature and airflow modeling over the lake surface and its surroundings, none of the WRF simulations well reproduce the characteristics that more snow occurs over the lake and downwind area. Overall, this study provides a useful reference for future convection-permitting climate modeling of snow or other extreme events when using the WRF model in the TP and other alpine regions. Plain Language Summary Snow falls frequently in cold seasons, especially in alpine regions. When there is a lake, a very interesting snowfall phenomenon named lake-effect snow may happen, that is, more snow occurred over the lake and downwind areas. However, the lake-effect snow caused by large lakes over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) may induce snow disaster events. Thus, conducting reliable simulations of lake-effect snow events are essential for understanding the mechanism of these particular events over the TP. This study investigated the performance of the numerical model in simulating precipitation, 2 m air temperature (T2), snowfall, and lake-effect snow (October 4-8, 2018) over the TP. The results show that the simulated precipitation and T2 perform reasonably well, although wet and cold biases are observed. However, the investigated numerical model fails to reproduce the characteristics of this event well, which may be due to the inaccurate temperature and airflow modeling over the lake surface and its surroundings. Continued improvement is needed for future modeling. Hence, this study provides some suggestions for future numerical modeling of lake-effect snow or other snow events over the TP and other alpine regions.

Warming-Induced Shrub Expansion and Lichen Decline in the Western Canadian Arctic	ECOSYSTEMS												Strong evidence for a pan-Arctic expansion of upright shrubs comes from analysis of satellite imagery, historical photographs, vegetation plots, and growth rings. However, there are still uncertainties related to local-scale patterns of shrub growth, resulting interactions among vegetation functional groups, and the relative roles of disturbance and climate as drivers of observed change. Here, we present evidence that widespread and rapid shrub expansion and lichen declines over a 15,000 km 2 area of the western Canadian Arctic have been driven by regional increases in temperature. Using 30 m resolution Landsat satellite imagery and high resolution repeat color-infrared aerial photographs, we show that 85% of the land surface has a positive 1985-2011 trend (P < 0.05) in NDVI, making this one of the most intensely greening regions in the Arctic. Strong positive trends (>0.03 NDVI/decade) occurred consistently across all landscape positions and most vegetation types. Comparison of 208, 1: 2,000 scale vertical air photo pairs from 1980 and 2013 clearly shows that this greening was driven by increased canopy cover of erect dwarf and tall shrubs, with declines in terricolous lichen cover. Disturbances caused by wildfires, exploratory gas wells, and drained lakes all produced strong, yet localized increases in NDVI due to shrub growth. Our analysis also shows that a 4 degrees C winter temperature increase over the past 30 years, leading to warmer soils and enhanced nutrient mineralization provides the best explanation for observed vegetation change. These observations thus provide early corroboration for modeling studies predicting large-scale vegetation shifts in low-Arctic ecosystems from climate change.

Paleoenvironmental proxy records from Lake Hovsgol, Mongolia, and a synthesis of Holocene climate change in the Lake Baikal watershed	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Here we discuss palcoenvironmental evolution in the Baikal region during the Holocene using new records of aquatic (diatom) and terrestrial vegetation changes from Hovsgol, Mongolia's largest and deepest lake. We reconcile previous contradictory Baikal timescales by constraining reservoir corrections of AMS dates on bulk sedimentary organic carbon. Synthesis of the Holocene records in the Baikal watershed reveals a northward progression in landscape/vegetation changes and an anti-phase behavior of diatom and biogenic silica proxies in neighboring rift lakes. In Lake Baikal, these proxies appear to be responsive to annual temperature increases after 6 ka, whereas in Lake Hovsgol they respond to higher precipitation/runoff from 11 to 7 ka. Unlike around Lake Baikal, warmer summers between 6 and 3.5 ka resulted in the decline, not expansion, of forest vegetation around Lake Hovsgol, apparently as a result of higher soil temperatures and lower moisture availability. The regional climatic proxy data are consistent with a series of 500-yr time slice Holocene GCM simulations for continental Eurasia. Our results allow reevaluation of the concepts of 'the Holocene optimum' and a 'maximum of the Asian summer monsoon', as applied to palcoclimate records from continental Asia.

Holocene climate inferred from glacier extent, lake sediment and tree rings at Goat Lake, Kenai Mountains, Alaska, USA	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Lake sediment, glacier extent and tree rings were used to reconstruct Holocene climate changes from Goat Lake at 550m asl in the Kenai Mountains, south-central Alaska. Radiocarbon-dated sediment cores taken at 55 m water depth show glacial-lacustrine conditions until about 9500 cal. yr BP, followed by organic-rich sedimentation with an overall increasing trend in organic matter and biogenic silica content leading Lip to the Little Ice Age (LIA). Through most of the Holocene, the northern Outlet of the Harding Icefield remained below the drainage divide that currently separates it from Goat Lake. A sharp transition from gyttja to inorganic mud about AD 1660 signifies the Journal of Quaternary Science reappearance of glacier meltwater into Goat Lake during the LIA, marking the maximum Holocene (postglacial) extent. Meltwater Continued to discharge into the lake until about AD 1900. A 207 yr tree-ring series from 25 Mountain hemlocks growing in the Goat Lake watershed correlates with other regional tree-ring series that indicate an average summer temperature reduction of about 1 degrees C during the 19th century compared with the early-mid 20th century. Cirque glaciers around Goat Lake reached their maximum LIA extent in the late 19th century. Assuming that glacier equilibrium-line altitudes (ELA) are controlled solely by summer temperature, then the cooling of 1 degrees C combined with the local environmental lapse rate would indicate an ELA lowering of 170 m. In contrast, reconstructed ELAs of 12 cirque glaciers near Goat Lake average only 34 +/- 18 m lower during the LIA. The restricted ELA lowering can be explained by a reduction in accumulation-season precipitation caused by a weakening of the Aleutian low-pressure system during the late LIA.

Most of the northern landscapes were presented in the sample, which are between the High Arctic (Tiksi area) and the Low Arctic/Subarctic (Chersky area). All limnic waters were supersaturated significantly with respect to the atmospheric pressure of CO(2) and CH(4). The content of CH(4) in High Arctic lakes ranged usually between 10(-1) and 10(-2) mu M in the surface layer and between 100 and 10(-2) mu M in the bottom layer. These values are about 10(2) times lower than in Low Arctic/Subarctic lakes. The partial pressure of CO(2) (PCO(2)) ranged usually between 400 and 6000 ppm in the Tiksi site and between 4000 and 20,000 ppm in the Chersky site, although extreme values of PCO(2) reached up to 27,000 ppm in the bottom layer of subarctic thaw lakes. The fall-winter shipboard measurements show that the value of PCO(2) varied significantly from the Bering Sea to the Laptevs Sea. The surface waters of the Laptevs Sea were undersaturated by CO(2), whereas other arctic seas east of the Laptevs seas were slightly supersaturated. The shallow coastal waters from the Laptevs Sea to the Bering Sea were usually 1.5-3-fold supersaturated by CO(2). The shipboard measurement of CH(4) in the arctic seas shows that the concentration of CH(4) was usually less than 0.015 mu M. It confirms the previous air-flight data that show a 10-15% increase of CH(4) over land. The analysis of up-to-date experimental results and glaciological data concerning air palaeovariations of CH(4) and CO(2) shows that evolution of the northern lakes might be a significant factor in the present and the past.					; Pipko, Irina/IUQ-6340-2023; Zimov, Sergey/JCD-7517-2023; Pipko, Irina/K-7217-2017; Semiletov, Igor/B-3616-2013; Davydov, Sergei/S-9906-2018	Semiletov, Igor/0000-0003-1741-6734; Pipko, Irina/0000-0002-2480-9563; Zimov, Sergey/0000-0002-0053-6599; Davydov, Sergei/0000-0003-0820-9426													1352-2310					MAY	1996	30	10-11					1657	1671		10.1016/1352-2310(95)00426-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/1352-2310(95)00426-2													WOS:A1996UH17900015

Quilotoa volcano - Ecuador: An overview of young dacitic volcanism in a lake-filled caldera	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH					4th Cities on Volcanoes Conference 2006	JAN, 2006	Quito, ECUADOR	Inst Geofis Escuela Politecn Natl				Quilotoa volcano, an example of young dacitic volcanism in a lake-filled caldera, is found at the southwest end of the Ecuador's volcanic front. It has had a long series of powerful plinian eruptions of moderate to large size (VEI=4-6), at repetitive intervals of roughly 10-15 thousand years. At least eight eruptive cycles (labeled Q-I to Q-VIII with increasing age) over the past 200 ka are recognized, often beginning with a phreatomagmatic onset and followed by a pumice-rich lapilli fall, and then a sequence of pumice, crystal, and lithic-rich deposits belonging to surges and ash flows. These unwelded pyroclastic flows left veneers on hillsides as well as very thick accumulations in the surrounding valleys, the farthest ash flow having traveled about 17 km down the Toachi valley. The bulk volumes of the youngest flow deposits are on the order of 5 km(3), but that of Q-I's 800 yr BP ash-fall unit is about 18 km(3). In the last two eruption cycles water has had a more important role. Upon Quilotoa's low-relief volcanic edifice, three calderas are recognized; the formation of the oldest one predates the Q-IV cycle and the others occurred during the Q-II and Q-I cycles. Dacite lava domes are common along the present caldera rim and most were emplaced at the end of the Q-II cycle; older domes of dark dacite belong to the Q-III and IV cycles. The explosive onset of the Q-I cycle expulsed as much as 250 million m(3) of the lake's water, resulting in large debris flows that scoured the eastern flanks of the edifice and descended the Toachi river. Little variation in the mineralogy and chemistry of Quilotoa's eruptive products is observed, suggesting that the source is a homogeneous magma body at shallow depth.

J	WARD, DM; OLSON, GJ				WARD, DM; OLSON, GJ			TERMINAL PROCESSES IN THE ANAEROBIC DEGRADATION OF AN ALGAL-BACTERIAL MAT IN A HIGH-SULFATE HOT-SPRING	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The algal-bacterial mat of a high-sulfate hot spring (Bath Lake) provided an environment in which to compare terminal processes involved in anaerobic decomposition. Sulfate reduction dominated CH4 production, as indicated by comparison of initial electron flow through the 2 processes, rapid conversion of [2-14C]acetate to 14CO2 and not to 14CH4, and the lack of rapid reduction of NaH14CO3 to 14CH4. Sulfate reduction was the dominant process at all depth intervals, but a marked decrease of sulfate reduction and sulfate-reducing bacteria was observed with depth. Concurrent methanogenesis was indicated by the presence of viable methanogenic bacteria and very low but detectable rates of CH4 production. A marked increased in CH4 production was observed after sulfate depletion despite high concentrations of sulfide (> 1.25 mM); methanogenesis was not inhibited by sulfide in the natural environment. Although a sulfate minimum and sulfide maximum occurred in the region of maximal sulfate reduction, the absence of sulfate depletion in interstitial water suggests that methanogenesis is always severely limited in Bath Lake sediments. Low initial methanogenesis was not due to anaerobic CH4 oxidation.																			0099-2240	1098-5336					1980	40	1					67	74		10.1128/AEM.40.1.67-74.1980	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.40.1.67-74.1980								16345597					WOS:A1980KA46700011

A more integrated approach at the watershed scale may improve our understanding of the conditions that lead to bloom formation, such as assessing the physico-chemical and biological factors that influence the lake microbial community, as well as identifying the linkages between Lake Erie and the surrounding watershed. Within the scope of the Government of Canada's Genomics Research and Development Initiative (GRDI) Ecobiomics project, we used high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize the spatio-temporal variability of the aquatic microbiome in the Thames River-Lake St. Clair-Detroit River-Lake Erie aquatic corridor. We found that the aquatic microbiome was structured along the flow path and influenced mainly by higher nutrient concentrations in the Thames River, and higher temperature and pH downstream in Lake St. Clair and Lake Erie. The same dominant bacterial phyla were detected along the water continuum, changing only in relative abundance. At finer taxonomical level, however, there was a clear shift in the cyanobacterial community, with Planktothrix dominating in the Thames River and Microcystis and Synechococcus in Lake St. Clair and Lake Erie. Mantel correlations highlighted the importance of geographic distance in shaping the microbial community structure. The fact that a high proportion of microbial sequences found in the Western Basin of Lake Erie were also identified in the Thames River, indicated a high degree of connectivity and dispersal within the system, where mass effect induced by passive transport play an important role in microbial community assembly. Nevertheless, some cyanobacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) related to Microcystis, representing less than 0.1% of relative abundance in the upstream Thames River, became dominant in Lake St. Clair and Erie, suggesting selection of those ASVs based on the lake conditions. Their extremely low relative abundances in the Thames suggest additional sources are likely to contribute to the rapid development of summer and fall blooms in the Western Basin of Lake Erie. Collectively, these results, which can be applied to other watersheds, improve our understanding of the factors influencing aquatic microbial community assembly and provide new perspectives on how to better understand the occurrence of cHABs in Lake Erie and elsewhere.

Summer warmth between 15,500 and 15,000 years ago enabled human repopulation of the northwest European margin	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION												High-magnitude decadal to centennial-scale abrupt changes in climate had a transformative effect on many past human populations. However, our understanding of these human/climate relationships is limited because robust tests of these linkages require region-specific quantified palaeoclimatic data with sufficient chronological precision to permit comparisons to the archaeological record. Here we present new high-resolution palaeoclimatic data and combine these with radiocarbon inventories of archaeological and faunal material, to test the relationship between abrupt warming and the ability of humans to rapidly repopulate the northwest margins of Europe (>50 degrees N and encompassing the area of Britain, Ireland, the surrounding islands and the North Sea basin) after regional abandonment during the Last Glacial Maximum. We address the timing of this process and the relevance of the abrupt climate changes recorded in the Greenland ice cores. We use the IntCal20 radiocarbon calibration curve to show that the earliest human repopulation in this region occurred up to 500 years before the climate of Greenland warmed. However, our analyses show that parts of the northwest European margin had already experienced substantial summer warming by this time, probably driven by changes of sea-ice area in the eastern North Atlantic. The associated warming influenced the distribution of key hunter-gatherer prey species such as reindeer, which were a key resource for humans. Accordingly, this study highlights asynchrony in seasonal warming across the North Atlantic region during the last deglaciation and shows that this asynchrony permitted human exploitation of northwest European margin paraglacial landscapes by similar to 15,200 years before the present.

Restoration objectives were directed towards reducing phosphorus levels in the system to minimize chronic summer fish kills. Previous studies had identified a critical phosphorus level of 0.4 mg l-1, below which no fish kills had been observed in this system. Above this level the kill frequency was a uniform 3.0%. Water quality data, consisting of 13 parameters, were collected over a four and one-quarter year period, representing conditions before, during and after the isolation. Evaluation of total phosphorus data indicated an approx. 90% reduction in estimated risk of summer fish kills as a result of the isolation. A general reduction in nutrient levels, as well as an increase in system stability, was also observed. Isolation of the lake proved to be a simple and economical means of attaining management objectives.																			0043-1354	1879-2448				APR	1987	21	4					385	393		10.1016/0043-1354(87)90185-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(87)90185-0													WOS:A1987H521800001

Sequences are known to form at millennial timescales, but whether they can form at scales as short as centuries (seventh-order, sensu Vail et al., 1991) was previously unconfirmed. This study maps lithofacies and sequence-stratigraphic surfaces from a ca 35 m high outcrop of the post-1500 ad part of the Holocene falling-stage wedge, and adjacent subaerial environments, along the Nahal Darga of the western Dead Sea coast, using drone images. The study also produces the first maps of subaqueous delta environments from remotely operated vehicle photographs. Comparison of outcrop and remotely operated vehicle data show that delta foresets form by debris-flow lobes accreting onto the delta face. Debris lobes increase in size with depth, have sorted cobble heads, and stack compensationally. Debris lobes dewater to form mostly erosive turbidity currents that cut channels and obstacle scours down slope. Topsets comprising fluvial, beach-ridge and lagoonal deposits prograde over these foresets. Surfaces separating foreset and topset elements of this Gilbert-delta system bind systems tracts and record downstep and upstep of the shoreface associated with base-level rises and falls. These surfaces match known lake-level changes in the Dead Sea in magnitude, timing and direction. They confirm Medieval (ca 600 to 1300 ad) and Modern (ca 1300 ad to Modern) century-scale sequences. These microsequences form in the Dead Sea because this climate-sensitive lake can generate metres-scale lake-level cycles on century timescales, and because depositional systems can, as shown here, reestablish sufficiently rapidly (& LE;10(1) years) to record century-scale cycles with complete systems tracts. Although conditions for generating microsequences are optimal in the Dead Sea, they are not unique. These microsequences pose a challenge to sequence stratigraphy because they typically fall below seismic resolution, may geometrically resemble higher-order composite sequences and complicate defining of anchor sequences within a sequence hierarchy.

Mercury export from glacierized Alaskan watersheds as influenced by bedrock geology, watershed processes, and atmospheric deposition	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Mercury (Hg) export from glacierized watersheds is poorly understood, with very few studies worldwide on Hg concentration and speciation in glacier snow, ice, and meltwater, and on Hg fluxes to downstream freshwater and coastal ecosystems. In addition to bedrock-derived geogenic Hg, glaciers may be releasing legacy accumulations of natural and anthropogenically-sourced Hg trapped in glacier ice melt each summer season. Our prior work showed that a glacierized stream in southeast Alaska had the highest reported flux of inorganic mercury of all known non-mining impacted streams, highlighting the strong ability of glaciers to mobilize the trace metal. Here we present data on Hg concentrations, speciation, partitioning, and fluxes from two more glacierized watersheds (Herbert and Mendenhall Rivers), and we compare them to an adjacent non-glacierized, forested-wetland stream (Peterson Creek). Results show that the glacierized streams carried Hg largely in the particulate form, whereas the forested-wetland stream carried it largely in the filtered fraction, at 20 fold higher concentration than in the glacierized streams, and with a higher percent of Hg in its methylated form. Yet, considering the higher water and sediment yields (as mass per watershed area per year) of the glacierized streams during the summer melt season, the yield of total Hg (unfiltered) from the Mendenhall glacier was approximately 80 times higher than from the Herbert glacier and 50 times higher than in Peterson Creek and presents the highest watershed yields of total Hg and methyl-Hg reported in the literature to date. Incongruous yields out of the two glacierized streams can likely be explained by differences in underlying bedrock geology. Based on the sediments entrained in Mendenhall meltwater, the late Paleozoic to Paleocene metasedimentary and volcanic rocks being eroded in the terminal 3 km of the Mendenhall are elevated above mean crustal concentrations by at least 4-17 fold. Differences in speciation between the glacierized and non-glacierized streams are likely accounted for by glacial and watershed geochemical conditions that variably promote Hg methylation.

At the same time, an ichthyoplankton trawl was used to identify acoustical targets. During the day, fish performed extensive shoaling behaviour in depths between 2 and approximately 40 m and were not accessible for trawling. By evening, with decreasing light intensity, shoals started to disintegrate and at night fish were relatively homogeneously distributed in the water column from the surface down to a depth of 40 m. Juvenile maraena whitefish could be caught by trawl as the only fish species at night. Shoaling behaviour started again approximately 1.5 h before sunrise. The data showed steep decreases in fish density between the two surveys in spring which indicates significant mortality of early juvenile coregonids as a result of poor availability of zooplankton in a highly oligotrophic post-mining lake.

SEXUAL DIFFERENCES IN THE ECOLOGY AND HABITAT SELECTION OF WESTERN TOADS (BUFO BOREAS) IN NORTHEASTERN OREGON	HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY												Several species of toads (family Bufonidae), including the Western Toad (Bufo boreas) have declined in the western United States. Information on toad ecology and habitat use is essential to determine potential causes for population declines, as is the potential relationship between this information and disturbance events. Aspects of western toad survival, mortality, movements, habitat selection, and diet were investigated at five study areas in northeastern Oregon during summers of 2002-2005. Of 100 radio-tagged toads monitored for one summer during these years, 32% survived until September, 29% were killed by predators, 10% died of other causes, and 29% were missing or had lost transmitters. At four study areas sampled in 2005, 24% of 37 males and 44% of 32 females sampled during the breeding season, and three dead male toads found after the breeding season tested positive for Bairachochytrium dendrobatidis. Females traveled significantly farther than males, and the maximum distances traveled by female and male toads were 6230 m and 3870 m, respectively. Toads with transmitters selected habitats: (1) with little or no canopy; (2) on south-facing slopes; (3) near water; and (4) with high densities of potential refugia (e.g., burrows, rocks, logs). Males were more closely associated with water than females. Twenty-six toads overwintered in rodent burrows (38%), under large rocks (27%), under logs or root wads (19%), and under banks adjacent to streams or a lake (15%). Diet consisted of 82% ants (Formicidae), 13% beetles (Coleoptera), and <1% in 8 additional orders of insects with no differences detected between male and female toads. Disturbance events, such as wildfire, can influence refugia and prey of toads, and climatic conditions may influence a toad's susceptibility to B. dendrobatidis.																			2151-0733	1931-7603				SEP	2006	1	1					27	38																WOS:000207830300006

We conducted boat electrofishing surveys in four tidal lakes of California's Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (SSJD) from 2010 to 2011 to describe introduced LMB recruitment dynamics. We evaluated growth, proximate composition, and health indices of young-of-the-year (YOY) LMB among tidal lakes and developed an integrated count model to determine how factors known to affect LMB recruitment shape SSJD population structure. Our results show a mismatch among growth, nutrition, and YOY abundance, where the tidal lake with the most abundant and fastest-growing LMB had the poorest nutritional status. The warm winter water temperatures and lack of a hatching-cohort growth advantage suggests overwinter starvation plays a less important role in SSJD LMB recruitment than in many native LMB habitats. Collectively, our results suggest that habitat characteristics (submerged aquatic vegetation) and not overwinter mortality shapes SSJD LMB population structure, a mechanism consistent with contemporary hypotheses about the altered fish community structure of the SSJD.					; Young, Matthew/LPP-2173-2024	Huntsman, Brock/0000-0003-4090-1949; Mahardja, Brian/0000-0003-0695-3745													0706-652X	1205-7533				MAY	2021	78	5					505	521		10.1139/cjfas-2020-0241	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2020-0241													WOS:000648462100001
J	Hawley, N; Lee, CH				Hawley, N; Lee, CH			Sediment resuspension and transport in Lake Michigan during the unstratified period	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Instrumented moorings were deployed during the winter of 1994-95 at three depths (28, 58 and 101 m) in southern Lake Michigan. Storms during the observation period were not unusually severe, so the processes observed are typical of those that occur during an average winter. Time series observations of water temperature, beam attenuation coefficient (a measure of water transparency) and current velocity show that local resuspension of bottom sediment occurred frequently after the breakdown of the thermocline. Resuspension was most frequent close to the shore but was also observed at the 58 m station, Local resuspension did not occur at the 101 m station, but advection to the site of material resuspended at shallower sites was observed. These observations do not support the hypothesis proposed by previous investigators that local resuspension at depths of 100 m or greater occurs during the unstratified period. It is more likely that fine-grained material resuspended by storm action in intermediate water depths (approximate to 30-60 m) is transported into the deeper parts of the lake by the general lake circulation.																			0037-0746					OCT	1999	46	5					791	805		10.1046/j.1365-3091.1999.00251.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3091.1999.00251.x													WOS:000083535300002

Walleye Introduction Eliminates Predation Refuge for Adfluvial Cutthroat Trout and Rainbow Trout	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												A predation refuge allowed Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri and Rainbow Trout O. mykiss to coexist with Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush in Buffalo Bill Reservoir, Wyoming. Recently, Walleye Sander vitreus appeared prompting concern about the persistence of Oncorhynchus populations. Study objectives were to (1) understand how environmental conditions have contributed to the coexistence of Lake Trout and Oncorhynchus populations, and (2) determine habitat use, diet, and per capita consumptive demand of Walleyes. While Walleye population expansion is difficult to predict, we compared consumptive demand of Lake Trout to biomass and production of Oncorhynchus populations to evaluate if additional predation demand by Walleyes could be sustained by prey populations. We measured limnological variables and sampled fishes monthly during April-October in 2012 and 2013 to determine habitat use and collect growth and diet samples. Low Secchi depth (1.6 m) and warm (19 degrees C) epilimnetic temperatures in summer appear to have inhibited Lake Trout predation and provided Oncorhynchus spp. with a thermal refuge from predation, but this refuge was eliminated with the introduction of Walleyes. Prior to thermal stratification, Lake Trout and Oncorhynchus spp. co-occurred at depths less than 18 m, but during summer, Oncorhynchus spp. remained in shallow water and Lake Trout retreated to the hypolimnion. Unlike Lake Trout, Walleyes always co-occurred with Oncorhynchus spp. Only large (>= 600 mm TL) Lake Trout consumed Oncorhynchus spp. and only during the unstratified period; in contrast, 64% of Walleye diet was Oncorhynchus spp., regardless of season. Per capita consumption of Oncorhynchus spp. by Walleyes (13.43 kg) was similar to that by Lake Trout (17.46 kg), despite the longer Lake Trout life span. Thus, although Lake Trout consumed only about 18% (462 kg) of the August biomass (2,624 kg) and 9% of annual production (5,049 kg) of young Oncorhynchus spp., expansion of the Walleye population could threaten Oncorhynchus populations in the future.

Denitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, and nitrogen fixation along a nitrate concentration gradient in a created freshwater wetland	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Wetlands are often highly effective nitrogen (N) sinks. In the Lake Waco Wetland (LWW), near Waco, Texas, USA, nitrate (NO3-) concentrations are reduced by more than 90% in the first 500 m downstream of the inflow, creating a distinct gradient in NO3- concentration along the flow path of water. The relative importance of sediment denitrification (DNF), dissimilatory NO3- reduction to ammonium (DNRA), and N-2 fixation were examined along the NO3- concentration gradient in the LWW. "Potential DNF" (hereafter potDNF) was observed in all months and ranged from 54 to 278 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1). "Potential DNRA" (hereafter potDNRA) was observed only in summer months and ranged from 1.3 to 33 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1). Net N-2 flux ranged from 184 (net denitrification) to -270 (net N-2 fixation) mu mol N m(-2) h(-1). Nitrogen fixation was variable, ranging from 0 to 426 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1), but high rates ranked among the highest reported for aquatic sediments. On average, summer potDNRA comprised only 5% (+/- 2% SE) of total NO3- loss through dissimilatory pathways, but was as high as 36% at one site where potDNF was consistently low. Potential DNRA was higher in sediments with higher sediment oxygen demand (r(2) = 0.84), and was related to NO (3) - concentration in overlying water in one summer (r(2) = 0.81). Sediments were a NO (3) - sink and accounted for 50% of wetland NO3- removal (r(2) = 0.90). Sediments were an NH4+ source, but the wetland was often a net NH4+ sink. Although DNRA rates in freshwater wetlands may rival those observed in estuarine systems, the importance of DNRA in freshwater sediments appears to be minor relative to DNF. Furthermore, sediment N-2 fixation can be extremely high when NO3- in overlying water is consistently low. The data suggest that newly fixed N can support sustained N transformation processes such as DNF and DNRA when surface water inorganic N supply rates are low.

Helminth Infracommunities of the Common Snapping Turtle (Chelydra serpentina serpentina) From Westhampton Lake, Virginia	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												Patterns of infracommunity similarity were examined for 27 male and 6 female common snapping turtles, Chelydra serpentina serpentina, collected from Westhampton Lake on the campus of the University of Richmond in Richmond, Virginia, during the summer months of 1979 and 1980. Patterns of infracommunity similarity based on parasite abundance emphasized differences between years and between host sexes. Patterns of similarity based on parasite presence or absence emphasized differences among the months sampled. This suggests that there were consistent seasonal changes across both years in terms of which parasites were present, but that there were differences between years in terms of the abundances of those parasites.

InSAR detects possible thaw settlement in the Alaskan Arctic Coastal Plain	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has proven to be an effective tool for monitoring surface deformation from volcanoes, earthquakes, landslides, and groundwater withdrawal. This paper seeks to expand the list of applications of InSAR data to include monitoring subsidence possibly associated with thaw settlement over the Alaskan Arctic Coastal Plain. To test our hypothesis that InSAR data are sufficiently sensitive to detect subsidence associated with thaw settlement, we acquired all Japanese Earth Resources Satellite-1 (JERS-1) L-band data available for the summers of 1996, 1997, and 1998 over two sites on the Alaska North Slope. The least amount of subsidence for both study sites was detected in the interferograms covering the summer of 1996 (2-3 cm), interferograms from 1997 and 1998 revealed that about 3 cm of subsidence occurred at the northern Cache One Lake site, and about 5 cm of subsidence was detected at the southern Kaparuk River site. These preliminary results illustrate the capacity of the L-band (24 cm) wavelength JERS-1 radar data to penetrate the short Arctic vegetation to monitor subsidence possibly associated with thaw settlement of the active layer and (or) other hydrologic changes over relatively large areas.					; Lu, Zhong/MZQ-2483-2025	Lu, Zhong/0000-0001-9181-1818; 													0703-8992	1712-7971				APR	2008	34	2					100	112		10.5589/m08-018	http://dx.doi.org/10.5589/m08-018													WOS:000259200800007

In cold climates, lake ice phenology-the timing and duration of ice cover during winter-is a key control on ecosystem function. Ice phenology is likely driven by a complex interplay between physical characteristics and climatic conditions. Under climate change, lakes are generally freezing later, melting out earlier, and experiencing a shorter duration of ice cover; however, few long-term records exist for large, high-elevation lakes which may be particularly vulnerable to climate impacts. Here, we quantified ice phenology over the last century (1927-2022) for North America's largest high-elevation lake-Yellowstone Lake-and compared it to seven similar lakes in northern Europe. We show that contrary to expectation, the ice phenology of Yellowstone Lake has been uniquely resistant to climate change. Indeed, despite warming temperatures in the region, no change in the timing nor duration of ice cover has occurred at Yellowstone Lake due to buffering by increased snowfall. However, with projections of continued warming and shifting precipitation regimes in the high Rocky Mountains, it is unclear how long this buffering will last.

The superstorm led to the formation of a storm-emplaced barrier, isolating a lagoonal marine embayment on Eleuthera Island, The Bahamas, resulting in the creation of a hypersaline lake basin. Originally, the area was a coastal mangrove swamp before the installation of the barrier. The lake basin developed on antecedent topography, with Pleistocene headlands bounding the embayment. Georadar surveys indicate that the barrier's origin was a single event, likely an intense storm. Shore-normal images reveal landward-sloping bounding surfaces and point-source reflections consistent with a surge barrier, in contrast to multiple beach-ridge sets of adjacent paleoshorelines. The recorded event falls within a global period of heightened storminess between 4100-3700 YBP, serving as a southern datapoint that complements Atlantic seaboard records. The preserved barrier suggests that its installation was followed by a sea-level stillstand after the postglacial rise, aligning with regional and global sea-level records. Post-impoundment, the saline coastal pond preserves a finely detailed hydroclimatic and hurricane record. These records indicate increased wetness in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic after 1300 cal BP, with a relatively stable period in the Bahamas from 1300 cal BP to approximately 300 cal BP. Hurricane proxy indicators reveal heightened activity between 3900 and 2000 cal BP, with additional spikes between 1100-1000 and 900-500 cal BP, coinciding with the Medieval Climate Anomaly. This study highlights the integration of geophysical and sedimentological data to reveal both stochastic and gradual processes shaping the evolution of coastal geomorphology.																			0272-7714	1096-0015				OCT 15	2025	324								109454	10.1016/j.ecss.2025.109454	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2025.109454		JUL 2025											WOS:001544066400003
J	WATSON, S; MCCAULEY, E				WATSON, S; MCCAULEY, E			CONTRASTING PATTERNS OF NETPLANKTON AND NANOPLANKTON PRODUCTION AND BIOMASS AMONG LAKES	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The relative contribution of nanoplankton to total algal biomass was shown to be negatively correlated with total phosphorus during summer over a wide range of lakes. We hypothesize that this pattern can be explained either by changes in the relative growth rates of net- or nanoplankton with increased nutrient levels, or through the regulation of the nanoplankton biomass by herbivores, allowing disproportionate increases in netplankton biomass in more eutrophic systems. These explanations were tested by examining the relationships between net primary production (grams of carbon per cubic metre per year) and biomass (micrograms per litre) of these size fractions and total phosphorus concentrations (micrograms per litre) using literature data from lakes throughout the world. The production of the net- and nanoplankton vary similarly with total phosphorus, while the biomasses (and thus the ratios of production to biomass) of the two groups show significantly different relationships. Our results support the hypothesis that changes in the size distribution of summer phytoplankton with enrichment seem to be influenced more by herbivores than by changes in the relative growth rates of the two size fractions.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAY	1988	45	5					915	920		10.1139/f88-112	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f88-112													WOS:A1988N748600020

The dynamic flux chamber is made of quartz glass, and has low blanks. Water samples were collected, and dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM), reactive and total mercury concentrations in water were measured using gold trap pre-concentration and AFS detection method. Meanwhile meteorological parameters, such as wind speed, wind direction, intensity of solar radiation, air and water temperature, and relative humidity were monitored using a portable weather station. Water surface is a net atmospheric mercury emission source even at cold season (autumn), and the average mercury emission rate is 3.0 ng m(-2) h(-1). We observed a strong correlation between wind speed and mercury emission rate, suggesting that strong wind facilitate mercury evaporation process from the water system during cold season. No significant correlations between Hg emission rate and solar radiation, water and air temperature were obtained.

Totally, 14 C-14 dates and 6 optically simulated luminescence (OSL) dates are obtained from the QTH01 and QTH02 sections. The proxies of grain-size, total organic carbon content (TOC), C/N and delta C-13 are used for wavelet analysis, and the results show obvious similar to 256, similar to 512 and similar to 1024-year climate cycles, which are consistent with the Holocene millennial and centennial scale climate cycles in the typical Asian summer monsoon domain. In different parts of the Zhuye Lake, the Holocene sediments show variable climate cycles that are affected by the lake basin topography. In the Zhuye Lake, the Holocene climate cycles are mainly correlated with the solar-related Asian summer monsoon variability and the North Atlantic ice-rafting events.

J	Camur, MZ; Mutlu, H				Camur, MZ; Mutlu, H			Major-ion geochemistry and mineralogy of the Salt Lake (Tuz Golu) basin, Turkey	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												In the Salt Lake basin of Turkey, chemical composition of inflow surface waters defines a continuous trend from Ca-HCO3-rich spring waters to Na-SO4-Cl-rich brines. Considerable compositional variation exists among the surface waters. Water-rock interaction governs compositional variations in springs, streams and rivers, and is enhanced by evaporation and precipitation of calcite and protodolomite. Solute concentrations of the streams and the rivers are partially controlled by the mineralogy of the playa deposits. The concentration increase from inflow surface waters to a Na-Cl-type lake surface brine is not accessible to direct observation. The principal cause of the evolution from SO4-rich brine to Cl-rich brine in the lake is interpreted as the recycling of solutes through the differential dissolution of efflorescent crusts. In the lake, major-ion concentrations generally exhibit an evaporation-dependent evolution trend that is further modified by precipitating halite, gypsum, aragonite and calcite. Sediments of the lake are predominantly composed of gypsum, dolomite, huntite, magnesite, and subordinately of polyhalite minerals. Magnesite and huntite are mostly early diagenetic minerals that have been formed by the transformation of dolomite in the presence of pore fluids with a high Mg/Ca ratio.

Runners who complete the round and wish to have their achievement recognized must submit a detailed timetable of their progress. From an analysis of these submissions we have: (a) tested an elaboration to the well-known Naismith Rule for predicting progress in mountainous country; (b) tested the conjecture that successful athletes in stamina events apply a constant work rate; (c) estimated the effect of such additional factors as darkness or fatigue. The objective of our work is threefold. First, to help runners planning an attempt on the round. Secondly, (as the Lake District mountains are so well known and accessible) to provide any readers who are mountain walkers with an opportunity to check our estimates against their own experience and judgement. This can of course be done for any section of the route, and does not require the whole round to be tackled. Thirdly, to make our findings applicable for mountainous areas other than the Lake District.																			0160-5682					OCT	1994	45	10					1123	1130																WOS:A1994PK18200003

At a regional scale, assessing recent trends and anticipating impacts requires data from a number of lakes, but long term in situ monitoring programs are scarce, particularly in mountain areas. In this work, we propose the combined use of satellite-derived temperature with in situ data for a five-year period (2017-2022) from 5 small (<0.5km(2)) high altitude (1880-2680 masl) Pyrenean lakes. The comparison of in situ and satellite-derived data in a common period (2017-2022) during the summer season showed a notably high (r = 0.94, p < 0.01) correlation coefficient, indicative of a robust relationship between the two data sources. The root mean square errors ranged from 1.8 degrees C to 3.9 degrees C, while the mean absolute errors ranged from 1.6 degrees C to 3.6 degrees C. We applied the obtained in situ-satellite eq. (2017-2022) to Landsat 5, 7 and 8/9 data since 1985 to reconstruct the summer surface temperature of the five studied lakes with in situ data and to four additional lakes with no in situ monitoring data. Reconstructed LSWT for the 1985-2022 showed an upward trend in all lakes. Moreover, paleolimnological reconstructions based on sediment cores studies demonstrate large changes in the last decades in organic carbon accumulation, sediment fluxes and bioproductivity in the Pyrenean lakes. Our research represents the first comprehensive investigation conducted on high mountain lakes in the Pyrenees that compares field monitoring data with satellite-derived temperature records. The results demonstrate the reliability of satellite-derived LSWT for surface temperatures in small lakes, and provide a tool to improve the LSWT in lakes with no monitoring surveys.

It is shown that the wind variations less than 30 days are the main component of total intraseasonal signal. The intraseasonal variations in this time period are associated with two distinctive wave trains over Eurasia starting from the North Atlantic Ocean. One wave train propagates along the polar front jet eastward over Europe and Siberia and then southeastward after passing the Lake Baikal. The other wave train propagates along the subtropical jet southeastward through the Mediterranean region and the Arabian Peninsula to north India and then eastward to southern China. The East Asian wind and temperature anomalies are determined by the combination of the two wave trains. An anomalous cyclone forms over East Asia with large extent and intensity when the two wave trains work coherently, resulting in strong lower-level northerly wind anomalies with a large meridional extent. More cold air is transported southward from high latitudes by anomalous northerly winds, causing widespread and large temperature decrease in East Asia. When only a single wave train exists, lower-level wind and temperature anomalies are reduced. When there is a destructive interference of the two wave trains, the lower-level wind and temperature anomalies are weak in East Asia. Observational analyses and barotropic model experiments indicate that the formation of the two wave trains may be related to the combination of disturbances at different locations over the North Atlantic Ocean.

In the acidified lake (total alkalinity .ltoreq. 0.0 .mu.eq L-1) the mean pH decreased from 5.5 in 1981 to 4.2 in 1983. Chironomidae comprised 71.3% of the MZB numbers and 19.6% of the wet weight. Over the study period the wet weight of Chironomidae increased (p < 0.04) as did the total numbers of Chironomidae in general (p < 0.01) and Tanytarsini (p < 0.01) in particular. Total numbers of MZB also increased (p < 0.02) in the acidified lake, but there was no significant change in the number of taxa, diversity or total wet weight. In the moderately sensitive lake (total alkalinity 47.4 .mu.eq L-1, mean pH 6.1). Chironomidae were numerically (43%) dominant but Odonata (18.6%)and Mollusca (12.7%) dominated wet weight.

However, direct evidence and knowledge of the mechanisms of the effects of heatwaves on harmful cyanobacteria blooms are limited and un-clear. In 2022, we measured chlorophyll-a (Chla) at 20-s intervals based on a novel ground-based proximal sensing sys-tem (GBPSs) in the shallow eutrophic Lake Taihu and combined in situ Chla measurements with meteorological data to explore the impacts of heatwaves on cyanobacterial blooms and the potential relevant mechanisms.

The daily Chla significantly increased with increasing MAT and photosynthetically active ra-diation (PAR) and decreasing wind speed, revealing a clear promotion effect on harmful cyanobacteria blooms from the heatwaves.

J	Jacoby, JM; Collier, DC; Welch, EB; Hardy, FJ; Crayton, M				Jacoby, JM; Collier, DC; Welch, EB; Hardy, FJ; Crayton, M			Environmental factors associated with a toxic bloom of Microcystis aeruginosa	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Environmental factors associated with the occurrence of toxic cyanobacterial blooms and toxin production were investigated during the summers of 1994 and 1995 in Steilacoom Lake, Washington. A pronounced and prolonged toxic bloom of Microcystis aeruginosa occurred during summer 1994 but not during 1995. Lake characteristics that were associated with the toxic bloom in 1994 were higher total phosphorus, decreased water transparency, high water column stability, high surface water temperature and pH, and decreased lake flushing. Decreased water transparency during 1994 may have been due to significantly lower zooplankton abundance. We hypothesize that this decreased transparency was caused by increased planktivory by higher numbers of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) fingerlings during 1994 and (or) inhibition of zooplankton grazing by Microcystis. The success of Microcystis over other cyanobacteria was associated with low nitrogen to phosphorus ratios and low nitrate-nitrogen with sufficient ammonium-nitrogen concentrations. Toxin production (i.e., micrograms of microcystin per gram of plankton biomass) was not constant over the duration of detectable toxicity; hence, no relationship was found between Microcystis abundance and microcystin concentration. However, microcystin concentration was positively correlated with increasing soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations between 1 and 10 mu g.L-1, indicating that toxin production may have been limited by phosphorus.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	2000	57	1					231	240		10.1139/cjfas-57-1-231	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-57-1-231													WOS:000084870600024

A Tibetan lake sediment record of Holocene Indian summer monsoon variability	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Sedimentological data and hydrogen isotopic measurements of leaf wax long-chain n-alkanes (delta D-wax) from an alpine lake sediment archive on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau (Paru Co) provide a Holocene perspective of Indian summer monsoon (ISM) activity. The sedimentological data reflect variations in lake level and erosion related to local ISM rainfall over the Paru Co catchment, whereas delta D-wax reflects integrated, synoptic-scale ISM dynamics. Our results indicate that maximum ISM rainfall occurred between 10.1 and similar to 5.2 ka, during which time there were five century-scale high and low lake stands. After 5.2 ka, the ISM trended toward drier conditions to the present, with the exception of a pluvial event centered at 0.9 ka. The Paru Co results share similarities with paleoclimate records from across the Tibetan Plateau, suggesting millennial-scale ISM dynamics were expressed coherently. These millennial variations largely track gradual decreases in orbital insolation, the southward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), decreasing zonal Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) gradients and cooling surface air temperatures on the Tibetan Plateau. Centennial ISM and lake-level variability at Paru Co closely track reconstructed surface air temperatures on the Tibetan Plateau, but may also reflect Indian Ocean Dipole events, particularly during the early Holocene when ENSO variability was attenuated. Variations in the latitude of the ITCZ during the early and late Holocene also appear to have exerted an influence on centennial ISM rainfall. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Water level history for Lake Turkana, Kenya in the past 15,000 years and a variable transition from the African Humid Period to Holocene aridity	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Relict beaches adjacent to Lake Turkana, Kenya provide a record of water level variability for the Late Quaternary. This study focused on deciphering the geomorphology, sedimentology, stratigraphy and C-14 chronology of strand plain sequences in the Kalokol and Lothagam areas, at the western margin of the Lake. Nine >30 m oscillations in water level were documented between ca. 15 and 4 ka. The earliest lake level oscillation between ca. 14.5 and 13 ka is not well constrained with water level to at least 70 m above the present surface and subsequently fell to at least 50 m. Lake level increased to at least 90 m between ca. 11.2 and 10.4 ka, post Younger Dryas cooling. Water level fell by >30 m by 10.2 ka, with another potential rise at ca. 8.5 ka to >70 m above current level. Lake level regressed by >40 m at 82 ka coincident with cooling in the equatorial eastern Atlantic Ocean. Two major >70 m lake level oscillations centered at 6.6 and 5.2 ka may reflect enhanced convection with warmer sea surface temperatures in the western Indian Ocean. The termination of the African Humid Period occurred from ca. 8.0 to 4.5 ka and is characterized by highly variable lake level ( >40 m), rather than one monotonic fall in water level. This lake level variability reflects a complex response to variations in the extent and intensity of the East and West African Monsoons near geographic and topographic limits within the catchment of lake Turkana. Also, for this closed lake basin excesses and deficits in water input are amplified with a cascading lake effect in the East African Rift Valley and through the Chew Bahir Basin. The final regression from a high stand of >90 m above the present lake began at 5.2 ka and water level was below 20 m by 4.5 ka; and for the remainder of the Holocene. This sustained low stand is associated with weakening of the West African Monsoon, a shift of the mean position of Congo Air Boundary west of the Lake Turkana catchment and with meter-scale variability in lake level linked to Walker circulation across the Indian Ocean.

The viability of PPR wetlands depends on hydrological connectivity and the degree of connectivity has been described as a product of both regional and localized groundwater flow systems. In this study, we evaluated the hydrogeology and groundwater flow system at the hummocky Spring Run wetland complex within the Iowa Great Lake (IGL) watershed in northwest Iowa over a two-year period. Spring Run serves as a microcosm for understanding groundwater flow pathways within the larger IGL region. Using a network of 16 shallow monitoring wells installed into upland glacial till and interspersed organic-rich wetlands, groundwater flow within the upland till primarily was found to follow local topography and discharge to local wetlands at the till-wetland interface. Interspersed wetlands intercept the water table and provide areas for local groundwater discharge. Once groundwater flows into the wetlands, the wetlands direct water flow laterally out of the area or downward into regional sand aquifers. Spatial patterns in groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration (ET) were observed with recharge and ET much higher in the wetland areas than in the uplands. Groundwater flow from upland glacial till areas helps to subsidize elevated ET in the wetlands and direct shallow water back to the atmosphere. Study results from Spring Run suggest that within a representative hummocky pothole complex, groundwater flow appears to be highly localized. Regional export of water from these areas may occur if underlain by subsurface drainage or deeper sand aquifers.

Preliminary examination of sounds produced by Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) during their fall spawning migrationa)	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												A preliminary description of sounds produced by three species of Pacific salmon was conducted to address the lack of quantified call characteristics in previous studies. Wild Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), pink salmon (O. gorbuscha), and coho salmon (O. kisutch) were diverted from a natural spawning migration in the Big Qualicum River located on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada and held in the adjacent hatchery during the 2017 fall migration. Underwater sounds were opportunistically recorded continuously over four week in holding raceways containing Chinook only, coho only, or mixed pink and Chinook salmon, and examined for sounds. All groups produced sounds in three categories based on mechanism: hydrodynamic (surface splash), air movement (miscellaneous and 7 named types), and unknown mechanism (pulse). Pulse, gill-bubble fast repetitive tick air movement sounds, and miscellaneous air movement sounds occurred in all groups and differences in some characteristics of sounds were found between the species groups. Additionally, even though pink salmon were not recorded separately, data suggest they produce a very fast repetitive tick air movement sound more often compared to Chinook salmon. Our results represent the first detailed description of the types and characteristics of sounds produced by wild Pacific salmon.

J	Bailey-Watts, AE; Kirika, A				Bailey-Watts, AE; Kirika, A			Poor water quality in Loch Leven (Scotland) in 1995 in spite of reduced phosphorus loadings since 1985: the influences of catchment management and inter-annual weather variation	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Eight tonnes of phosphorus in all forms (total phosphorus, TP) entered Loch Leven from its catchment in 1995, compared to 20 t in 1985. Diffuse run-off from the land, and waste from over-wintering geese contributed 59% of the total loading in 1995 cf. 42% in 1985. Point-sources of sewage, and waste-water from fish-rearing ponds, produced the rest. Inputs of phosphorus in soluble reactive form (SRP) totalled 5 t, i.e. 63% of the TP loading in 1995, as compared with 1985 values of 11.8 t and 59%. Point-sources of SRP contributed 54% of the total SRP input in 1995 cf. 69% in 1985. Loadings from three sewage treatment works (STW) totalled 3.1 t TP in 1995 as compared with 5.3 t in 1985; this included 2.6 t SRP (cf. 3.6 t). Daily per capita outputs of the upgraded Kinross North and Milnathort STWs were 0.68 g and 0.81 g TP, respectively, compared with pre-upgrade values of 1.77 g and 2.03 g. Nett reductions in TP and SRP loadings between 1985 and 1995, are 55% and 59% respectively. These values are attributable as much to the lower rainfall of 890 mm over the period of study in 1995, compared to 1250 mm in 1985, as to 'managed' elimination of P usage at a major industrial source, and upgrades of STWs. In spite of these cutbacks, a combination of the lower rainfall and an extraordinarily hot summer in 1995 negated the expected reduction in lake phosphorus and chlorophyll levels. The lowered specific areal loading of ca. 0.7 g P m(-2) estimated for 1995 still considerably exceeds the ideal maximum for the loch. These statistics nevertheless ignore the significance of a reduction of ca. 7 t in P entering the system in bio-available form, a recently completed upgrade of a major STW and channelling of effluent from a small works out of the catchment.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	1999	403						135	151		10.1023/A:1003758713050	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003758713050													WOS:000083279700011
J	RENMAN, G				RENMAN, G			FROST FORMATION IN THE ECOTONAL ZONE AND ITS ROLE FOR RELEASE OF NUTRIENTS	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In winter, the littoral substrate of ecotonal zones along north Swedish rivers and lakes freezes. Even if the littoral is flooded at freeze-up, the ice freezes solid to the shore substrate due to low temperature combined with a gradual decrease in water level during winter. Frost conditions were studied during an 8-year period along eight littoral transects in the River Vindelalven and adjacent riverside lagoons. Heavy frost heave with formation of needle ice was observed in several places. Nutrient release was suggested to take place due to the frost process. Sediment was taken to a laboratory experiment where samples with sediment and water were kept under unfrozen and frozen conditions during six months. N (total-N) and Ca were significantly released to the water, while P (total-P) did not show any clear movement from the frozen sediment. The results indicate that frost processes in ecotonal zones are involved in the movement of nutrients between sediment and water.

This study investigated the influences of microenvironmental factors around a waterbody on thermal perceptions, using questionnaires and meteorological measurements at the Central Lake of Southwest University of Science and Technology (SWUST) in Mianyang. Microenvironmental factors included sky view factor (SVF) and distance from the lake (DFL). It was found that people felt most comfortable in the shade of trees although some volunteers voted artificial canopy as their preferred thermal adaptation element. In addition, a linear regression yielded an NT of 28.44 & DEG;C in Mianyang during the summer of 2022. There were NT variations among different measurement sites (e.g., on the east shore, it was 28.18 & DEG;C on the waterside, 27.11 & DEG;C away from the lake, and 25.53 & DEG;C far from the lake; while it was 27.57 & DEG;C under the tree crown, 25.11 & DEG;C on the lawn, and 29.13 & DEG;C in the square). This variation may be due to human adaptation towards microenvironmental factors and their effects on microclimate. The variation in thermal responses owing to microenvironmental differences (different NTs at various types of sites) might be a novel finding in the field of OTC. This study provides important directions for microenvironment design in the future for OTC improvement.

Using them as such, however, requires a comprehensive understanding of the variables that affect their accumulation rates and properties. Here, we conduct a spatial and temporal study of sediment samples collected at the head of Martinez Channel (Chilean Patagonia, 48 degrees S), to understand how the fjord's sediments register changes in the hydrology of Baker River, Chile's largest river in terms of mean annual discharge. We apply end-member modeling to particle-size distributions of: (a) river suspended sediments, (b) surface sediments collected along a proximal-distal transect at the fjord head, and (c) fjord sediments collected in a sequential sediment trap at 15-day resolution during two consecutive years. We then validate the use of the grain-size end members for hydrological and climate reconstructions, using a sediment core that covers the last 35 years. Results show that the river suspended sediments and fjord sediments are consistently composed of two grain-size subpopulations. The finest end member (EM1; mode 4.03 mu m) reflects the meltwater contribution, which dominates in all but the winter season. The coarser end member (EM2; mode 18.7 mu m) dominates in winter, when meltwater contribution is reduced, and is associated with rainfall. We show that the fluxes of EM1 and EM2 provide quantitative estimates of baseflow (r = 0.87, p < 0.001) and quickflow (r = 0.86, p < 0.001), respectively. Additionally, we propose that log (EM1/EM2) can be used to reconstruct meltwater production (r = 0.67, p < 0.001) and temperature (r = 0.81, p < 0.001) in the lower Baker River watershed. These results support the use of fjord sediments for quantitative reconstructions of hydrological and climate variability in partially glacierized watersheds.					; Alvarez Garreton, Camila/M-1232-2016; Alvarez-Garreton, Camila/M-1232-2016; Bertrand, Sebastien/G-9744-2011	Amann, Benjamin/0000-0002-0101-0433; Reid, Brian/0000-0002-4274-3350; Alvarez Garreton, Camila/0000-0002-5381-4863; Bertrand, Sebastien/0000-0003-0374-4040													2169-9003	2169-9011				FEB	2022	127	2							e2021JF006391	10.1029/2021JF006391	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JF006391													WOS:000763468400010
J	Rushmer, EL				Rushmer, E. Lucy			Physical-scale modelling of jokulhlaups (glacial outburst floods) with contrasting hydrograph shapes	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Jokulhlaups (glacial outburst floods) are hazards in many glaciated environments. Jokulhlaups generated by different trigger mechanisms have different hydrograph shapes. Field evidence indicates that jokulhlaups with different hydrograph shapes produce different impacts. However, little attention has been paid to understanding the controls on jokulhlaups with differing hydrograph shapes and their subsequent impacts. Historically, flume studies have been used to investigate fluvial processes under controlled laboratory conditions. Nevertheless, few flume studies have replicated scaled hydrographs, and none have attempted to model field jokulhlaups. This study documents the technical procedure by which field prototype jokulhlaups were replicated using physical-scale modelling techniques: an 'exponentially rising' jokulhlaup characterized by a prolonged rising stage and a rapid falling stage, and a 'linearly rising' jokulhlaup characterized by a rapid rising stage and a prolonged falling stage. The parameters of water discharge, time, discharge acceleration and deceleration rate, sediment size and sediment discharge were scaled to a 1:20 ratio. Better-sorted sediment, more uniform downstream sediment thickness and more gradual aggradation and deposition rates resulted from the prolonged rising stage of the exponentially rising hydrograph. More time was available during the prolonged rising stage of the exponentially rising hydrograph for bedload sheets to migrate, and for sand ripples to develop. Rapid rising stage deposition during the linearly rising hydrograph produced thick proximal deposits, limited bedload sheet migration, massive sand sheets and structureless and poorly sorted sediments. During the prolonged falling of the linearly rising hydrograph, sufficient time was available to support sand ripple development. The study highlights that jokulhlaup hydrograph shape is important for controlling rates of sediment acquisition, transport, deposition, erosion and bedform development. The outcomes of these experimental investigations indicate that modelling of high magnitude floods is feasible in a laboratory flume. This technical approach has proved very beneficial for developing a greater understanding of flood impacts and the processes that operate during jokulhlaups.

Intermittent instability is widespread in plankton communities	ECOLOGY LETTERS												Chaotic dynamics appear to be prevalent in short-lived organisms including plankton and may limit long-term predictability. However, few studies have explored how dynamical stability varies through time, across space and at different taxonomic resolutions. Using plankton time series data from 17 lakes and 4 marine sites, we found seasonal patterns of local instability in many species, that short-term predictability was related to local instability, and that local instability occurred most often in the spring, associated with periods of high growth. Taxonomic aggregates were more stable and more predictable than finer groupings. Across sites, higher latitude locations had higher Lyapunov exponents and greater seasonality in local instability, but only at coarser taxonomic resolution. Overall, these results suggest that prediction accuracy, sensitivity to change and management efficacy may be greater at certain times of year and that prediction will be more feasible for taxonomic aggregates.

Yulong	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES												The accumulation and ablation of a glacier directly reflect its mass income and wastage, and ice temperature indicates glacier's climatic and dynamic conditions. Glaciological studies at Baishui Glacier No.1 in Mt. Yulong are important for estimating recent changes of the cryosphere in Hengduan Mountains. Increased glacier ablation and higher ice temperatures can cause the incidents of icefall. Therefore, it is important to conduct the study of glacier mass balance and ice temperature, but there are few studies in relation to glacier's mass balance and active-layer temperature in China's monsoonal temperate glacier region. Based on the field observations of mass balance and glacier temperature at Baishui Glacier No.1, its accumulation, ablation, net balance and near-surface ice temperature structure were analyzed and studied in this paper. Results showed that the accumulation period was ranged from October to the following mid-May, and the ablation period occurred from mid-May to October, suggesting that the ablation period of temperate glacier began about 15 days earlier than that of continental glaciers, while the accumulation period began about 15 days later. The glacier ablation rate was 6.47 cm d(-1) at an elevation of 4600 m between June 23 and August 30, and it was 7.4 cm d(-1) at 4800 m between June 26 and July 11 in 1982, moreover, they respectively increased to 9.2 cm d(-1) and 10.8 cm d(-1) in the corresponding period and altitude in 2009, indicating that glacier ablation has greatly intensified in the past years. The temperature of the main glacier body was close to melting point in summer, and it dropped from the glacier surface and reached a minimum value at a depth of 4-6 m in the ablation zone. The temperature then rose to around melting point with the depth increment. In winter, the ice temperature rose gradually with the increasing depth, and close to melting point at the depth of 10 m. Compared with the data from 1982, the glacier temperature has risen in the ablation zone in recent decades.					; Niu, Hewen/AHC-3884-2022	Niu, Hewen/0000-0001-7804-217X; 													1009-637X					AUG	2013	23	4					668	678		10.1007/s11442-013-1036-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11442-013-1036-4													WOS:000320754100007

Residue levels of organochlorine pesticides in some ecosystem components of Manzala Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												To evaluate the organochlorine pesticide (OCP) contamination of Manzala Lake, its ecosystem was investigated during the winter season (December to March). The studied ecosystem components were water, sediment, aquatic weeds, and fishes in four locations. The samples were analyzed by gas chromatography with electron capture detector. Pollutant levels of total OCPs showed significantly high levels in the water areas of Round road (46.253 ng/ml), Port-Said Damietta road (19.301 ng/ml), followed by Bughas El-Rasoah (5.539 ng/ml), then Ashtoum El Gamel (natural reserve area now) (0.289 ng/ml). Organochlorines were detected in sediment only in Round road (3.359 mu g/kg) and Port-Said Damietta road (0.171 mu g/kg) by significant order while they were undetectable in Ashtoum El Gamel and Bughas El-Rasoah. Total OCPs in aquatic weeds ranged between 0.194 mu g/kg in Port-Said Damietta and 0.026 mu g/kg in Ashtoum El Gamel. While OCPs were 0.160 and 0.153 mu g/kg in Round road and Bughas El-Rasoah, respectively. Concerning fish muscles OCPs were significantly higher in the Round road area (0.397 mu g/kg) followed by the Port-Said Damietta road (0.258 mu g/kg), and finally, Ashtoum El Gamel samples (0.126 mu g/kg). The results revealed the direct relation for the accumulation of OCPs between studied ecosystem parameters at the Manzala Lake during the winter season. Results also demonstrated that fish samples collected from the Manzala Lake in the studied areas were contaminated with levels of organochlorines, not higher than the maximum permissible level recorded by FAO/WHO, and that the public is not at risk with fish consumption.

Some gas bubbles beneath the ice contained as much as 11% O2 when the lake water contained < 0.30 mgl-1 dissolved O2. In the field, gas bubbles prolonged survival of all species, especially the mudminnow and stickleback. In the laboratory, brook sticklebacks exhibited the lowest and fathead minnows the highest routine metabolic rate corrected for weight. Rate of gill ventilation of all 3 increased from 20 to 70 beats/min as O2 levels declined from 4.0 to 0.25 mgl-1. At low O2 levels they moved to the upper 1/3 of the test tanks. Small size, low metabolic rate, tolerance of low O2 conditions and reduced activity resulted in reduced demand for dissolved O2.

Carbon release from boreal peatland open water pools: Implication for the contemporary C exchange	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												While peatland ecosystems overall are long-term net carbon (C) sinks, the open water pools that are characteristic of boreal peatlands have been found to be C sources to the atmosphere. However, the contribution of these pools to the ecosystem level C budget is often ignored even if they cover a significant area of the peatland surface. Here we examine the annual CO2 and CH4 ecosystem-atmosphere exchange, including the release following ice melt, from pools in a boreal maritime peatland, in order to estimate the annual loss of C from these water bodies. Over a 16month period, dissolved CO2 and CH4 were measured periodically in five pools while continuous measurements of CO2 were made in one pool using a nondispersive infrared (NDIR) sensor. Fluxes were calculated using the thin boundary layer model and the eddy covariance technique (spring release only). We calculated an annual C release from pools of 103.3g C m(-2)yr(-1) of which 15% was released during the spring ice melt. This release is the same order of magnitude, but with the opposite sign, as the average net ecosystem carbon balance for pool-free northern peatlands (-22 to -70g C m(-2)yr(-1)). We discuss the origin of the released C, as the magnitude of the release could have a significant impact on the contemporary C exchange of boreal peatlands.					; Roulet, Nigel/W-3402-2019	Garneau, Michelle/0000-0002-1956-9243; Strachan, Ian/0000-0001-6457-5530; Roulet, Nigel/0000-0001-9571-1929													2169-8953	2169-8961				MAR	2014	119	3					207	222		10.1002/2013JG002423	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2013JG002423													WOS:000334534500003

Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) stock structure in Lake Michigan: an analysis using mark-recapture data	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												To evaluate the stock structure of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) in the southern basin of Lake Michigan and in Green Bay, we analyzed recaptures from a lake-wide mark-recapture study implemented from 1996 to 2001 to infer the range and pattern of movement and spawning-site fidelity. Yellow perch generally moved south along the western shoreline, west along the southern shoreline, and north along the eastern shoreline during summer and non-summer months; the magnitude of movement was greater after spawning. Spawning yellow perch frequently returned to the same site, with 35%-80% of recaptured individuals returning to their marking site. Results from multiple tagging sites within Illinois indicated that spawners may return to larger areas rather than to specific sites, suggesting that large spawning complexes exist. Despite strong fidelity in some areas, straying was evident from all sites during spawning, resulting in mixing throughout the southern basin. Such mixing could promote gene flow and diminish stock differentiation. Dispersal of yellow perch within the southern basin of Lake Michigan occurred regularly across adjacent management boundaries. Therefore, adjacent jurisdictions may wish to consider re-examining their regulations based on this information to ensure consistent, complementary regulations that incorporate the movement patterns of yellow perch.

They are at the headwaters of the Nelson River in northern Manitoba at approximately 55[degree] N. longitude, 101[degree] W. latitude. The lakes are each about 1 square mile in area and are all under 30 feet in depth. For 4 years physical and chemical studies have been conducted as part of the Trianenophorus investigation. During 6 months of the year the lake is ice-covered. No summer thermal or oxygen stratification is evident. Oxygen concentrations remain at a high level throughout the year. Summer water temperatures follow very closely changes in air temperature. The pH remains close to neutrality and the dissolved mineral content is about 60 ppm. The mineral content of these 3 soft water lakes is similar. Flora and fauna identified from Heming Lake include 41 genera of phytoplankton, 35 species of zooplankton, 17 genera of bottom organizms, 13 species of fish and 9 species of fish parasites.																									1958	15	2					203	218		10.1139/f58-011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f58-011													WOS:A1958WZ01100004

Decreasing Hospital Length of Stay for Bronchiolitis by Using an Observation Unit and Home Oxygen Therapy	JAMA PEDIATRICS												Importance: Pediatric observation units (OUs) offer the opportunity to safely and efficiently care for common illnesses previously cared for in an inpatient setting. Home oxygen therapy (HOT) has been used to facilitate hospital discharge in patients with hypoxic bronchiolitis. It is unknown how implementation of a hospitalwide bronchiolitis treatment protocol promoting OU-HOT would affect hospital length of stay (LOS). Objective: To test the hypothesis that using OU-HOT for bronchiolitis would decrease LOS. Design and Setting: Retrospective cohort study at Primary Children's Medical Center, Salt Lake City, Utah. Participants: Uncomplicated bronchiolitis patients younger than 2 years admitted during the winter seasons of 2005 through 2011. Interventions: Implementation of a new bronchiolitis care process encouraging use of an OU-HOT protocol. Main Outcome Measures: Mean hospital LOS, discharge within 24 hours, emergency department (ED) bronchiolitis admission rates and ED revisit/readmission rates, and inflation-adjusted cost. Results: A total of 692 patients with bronchiolitis from the 2010-2011 bronchiolitis season were compared with 725 patients from the 2009-2010 season. Implementation of an OU-HOT protocol was associated with a 22.1% decrease in mean LOS (63.3 hours vs 49.3 hours, P<.001). Although LOS decreased during all 6 winter seasons, linear regression and linear quantile regression analyses for the 2005-2011 LOS data demonstrated a significant acceleration in the LOS decrease for the 2010-2011 season after implementation of the OU-HOT protocol. Discharges within 24 hours increased from 20.0% to 38.4% (P<.001), with no difference in ED bronchiolitis admission or ED revisit/readmission rates. After implementation of the OUHOT protocol, the total cost per admitted case decreased by 25.4% ($4800 vs $3582, P<.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Implementation of an OU-HOT protocol for patients with bronchiolitis safely reduces hospital LOS with significant cost savings. Although widespread implementation has the potential for dramatic cost savings nationally, further studies assessing overall health care use and cost, including the impact on families and outpatient practices, are needed.

We analyzed climate-related changes using direct human observations of ice freeze dates (1443-2014) for Lake Suwa, Japan, and of ice breakup dates (1693-2013) for Torne River, Finland. We found a rich array of changes in ice seasonality of two inland waters from geographically distant regions: namely a shift towards later ice formation for Suwa and earlier spring melt for Torne, increasing frequencies of years with warm extremes, changing inter-annual variability, waning of dominant interdecadal quasi-periodic dynamics, and stronger correlations of ice seasonality with atmospheric CO2 concentration and air temperature after the start of the Industrial Revolution. Although local factors, including human population growth, land use change, and water management influence Suwa and Torne, the general patterns of ice seasonality are similar for both systems, suggesting that global processes including climate change and variability are driving the long-term changes in ice seasonality.					; Batt, Ryan/D-7690-2013	Batt, Ryan/0000-0002-7267-5395; Aono, Yasuyuki/0000-0002-6950-4341; Sharma, Sapna/0000-0003-4571-2768; 													2045-2322					APR 26	2016	6								25061	10.1038/srep25061	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep25061								27113125					WOS:000374830600002
J	Ma, DY; Chen, S; Lu, J; Liao, HX				Ma, Diaoyuan; Chen, Shu; Lu, Jing; Liao, Haoxian			Study of the effect of periphyton nutrient removal on eutrophic lake water quality	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												To study the effect of periphyton on water quality, we chose to start our experiment in the summer, when microorganisms are active. In this study, we constructed six experimental groups to simulate eutrophic lakes and used polyurethane sponges as artificial substrates to support periphyton. We systematically studied the effect of periphyton on water quality and nutrient removal by monitoring water quality indexes, including total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), and established two required attachment area equations of periphyton for TN and TP to calculate the attachment area of periphyton required to decrease the concentration of TN and TP, which can provide effective reference for practical engineering decisions. The results show that periphyton can effectively degrade nutrients in eutrophic lakes. The maximum nutrient degradation that can be achieved is Delta TN = 4.93 mg/L and Delta TP = 2.92 mg/L, which can inhibit harmful algae growth compared with the control group; the highest rate of Chl-a degradation was 85.8%. The coefficients of the required attachment area equation of periphyton under the TN condition are as follows: k(1-TN) is 0.1843, k(2-TN) is 0.0002, and the nutrient removal capacity per unit area of periphyton is alpha(TN) = 1.23 x 10(-5) g/m(2).day. Under the TP condition, the parameters are as follows: k(1-TP) is 0.0910, k(2-TP) is 0.0004, and the nutrient removal capacity per unit area of periphyton is alpha(TP) = 2.46 x 10(-5) g/m(2).day. In summary, periphyton is a potential microorganism for in situ lacustrine remediation; its positive impact cannot be ignored during the treatment of eutrophic lakes. However, considering the effects of season, climate and latitude on the harmful algae blooms and periphyton growth, the above equation is only applicable to the subtropical monsoon climate in the summer. Its practicability in other places and seasons remains to be verified.

Located within a I hour drive of half the population of Ontario, there is currently major concern over the impact of rapid urbanization on the nutrient status of the lake. However, despite a more than doubling of the human population in the Lake Simcoe watershed over the past two decades, average total phosphorus (TP) levels were lower in 2000-2003 compared with 1980-1983 at six of eight lake stations, and declines were significant at the most nutrient-enriched near-shore sites located in Kempenfelt Bay (0.29 mu g/L/year) and Cook ' s Bay (0.31-0.41 mu g/L/year). Total P concentrations varied two-fold across the lake, and phytoplankton bio-volume followed a similar pattern, with greatest phytoplankton abundance occurring at high TP sites, particularly in Cook's Bay. Nevertheless, steep declines in bio-volume occurred at all sites beginning in the mid-1990s, and water clarity (Secchi disk depth) improved concurrently such that Secchi depths were 40-80% greater in 2000-2003 compared with 1980-1983. Zebra mussels, which became established in Lake Simcoe around 1995, likely contributed to decreased phytoplankton bio-volume and related improvements in water clarity, which began during the mid-1990s. Despite major reductions in phytoplankton bio-volume, average rates of dissolved oxygen (DO) depletion (18 m-bottom zone; normalized to 4 degrees C) did not change substantially over time, and were similar in 2000-2003 (average 1.25 +/- 0.21 g O-2/m(3)/month) compared with 1980-1983 (average 1.26 +/- 0.19 g O-2/m(3)/month). In contrast, minimum, end-of-summer DO levels (18 m-bottom) increased slightly over the period of record. Although there has been some improvement in end-of-summer DO availability, DO concentrations continue to decline to levels that are limiting to many fish species (e.g., 3.8 mg O-2/L in 2001) by the end of the summer stratified period.

For interpretation of tritium and carbon-14 data of first group, best fit is generally obtained applying << piston flow >> model with which a mean residence time of about 10-15 years is calculated. The second group seems to correspond to the last << nigero-tchadien >> humid phase of the Quaternary during which the aquifer would have been resplenished. Depending on geomorphological and structural features, springs and wells deliver a mixture of these two types of water in variable proportion. Elsewhere, C-13 content of old water springs could be highly disturbed by volcanic gazes.

Continental-aquatic mollusk hydrochemical occurrence patterns: Implications for population dynamics and paleoenvironmental reconstruction	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					22nd Pacific Climate Workshop	MAR 26-29, 2006	Pacific Grove, CA					Paired water and mollusk samples collected from 90 lakes, springs, and wetlands throughout the northwestern quarter of the United States suggest that, rather than just occupying discrete total dissolved solids (TDS) ranges as is often described, molluscan distribution is also related to solute types produced by solute evolution. This may explain why water bodies having similar environmental characteristics and TDS values have different molluscan assemblages. Therefore, continental-aquatic mollusk occurrences define solute and TDS fields that offer a means to assess past hydrology and climate. These relations also provide new insights into mollusk population dynamics. For example, molluscan distribution on the aquatic landscape is not a uniform continuum, but rather is a solute compositional mosaic, where taxa in adjoining lakes may be as isolated from each other as taxa on opposite sides of the continent. Knowledge regarding the relation of mollusk occurrence and solute composition can assist management decisions in sustaining threatened, sensitive, or endemic taxa, designing conservation programs, resolving wetland and spring mitigation issues, and determining the potential biological impacts from interbasin water transfers or ground water pumping.

Lake water microcystin concentrations were determined at intervals during the summer, using competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and indicated extremely high, localized microcystin concentrations of up to 126,000 ng/ml. Multiple extraction and analysis techniques were used in the determination of free and total microcystins in vomitus and liver samples from the poisoned dog. Vomitus and liver contained microcystins, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and the presence of microcystin-LR was confirmed in vomitus and liver samples using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Major toxic effects in a dog presented for treatment on the day following exposure included fulminant liver failure and coagulopathy. The patient deteriorated rapidly despite aggressive treatment and was euthanized. Postmortem lesions included diffuse, acute, massive hepatic necrosis and hemorrhage, as well as acute necrosis of the renal tubular epithelium. A diagnosis of microcystin poisoning was based on the demonstration of M. aeruginosa and microcystin-LR in the lake water, as well as in vomitus produced early in the course of the poisoning; the presence of microcystin-LR in liver tissue; and a typical clinical course including gastroenteritis and fulminant liver failure.					; Sebbag, Lionel/KZV-1276-2024; Van der Merwe, Deon/D-5326-2011	Sebbag, Lionel/0000-0002-0103-0127; 													1040-6387	1943-4936				JUL	2012	24	4					679	687		10.1177/1040638712445768	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638712445768								22604771					WOS:000307118700005
J	van Poorten, BT; Post, JR				van Poorten, BT; Post, JR			Seasonal fishery dynamics of a previously unexploited rainbow trout population with contrasts to established fisheries	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Although predator-prey interactions between anglers and fish populations are well studied and understood, little is known about whether these interactions differ between lightly and fully exploited populations. Furthermore, within-season shifts in catch rates are poorly understood. These differences have been thought to be due in part to changes in fish behavior after catch and release, which reduces the overall catchability of the population. To address these questions, angling was introduced to a previously unexploited population of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and the within-season fishery dynamics were contrasted with those of fully exploited populations. We found that catch rates rapidly decreased after the introduction of angling; moreover, once this had occurred, angler effort decreased. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) and catchability of the lightly exploited population, were initially quite high compared with most exploited populations but quickly decreased throughout the summer to levels similar to those of fish populations that have been open to angling for decades. Therefore, the differences in catch rates are transitory and the unexploited population quickly becomes indiscernible from fully exploited populations. Seasonality in CPUE was observed in all lakes, with significant decreases in CPUE throughout the summer. These changes in CPUE reflected changes in catchability throughout the season. Although the relative effects of harvest and possible behavioral shifts in fish after catch and release accounted for some variation in catchability, the effects were insufficient to explain total seasonal decreases in catchability in the previously unexploited population. These findings demonstrate that any potential shifts in fish behavior subsequent to catch and release are inadequate to explain seasonal shifts in catch rates. Apparently, seasonal changes in CPUE are driven more by ecological processes than by the fishery.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				FEB	2005	25	1					329	345		10.1577/M03-225.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M03-225.1													WOS:000228031200037
J	Dutkiewicz, A; Herczeg, AL; Dighton, JC				Dutkiewicz, A; Herczeg, AL; Dighton, JC			Past changes to isotopic and solute balances in a continental playa: clues from stable isotopes of lacustrine carbonates	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												In many salt lakes around the world, the relative abundance of preserved authigenic minerals is different from that predicted from solute mass balance calculations. Conventional mass balance models assume that chloride behaves conservatively over long periods of time and fail to take into account the role of diffusion, deflation and fractional crystallisation/dissolution of salts. An alternative approach is to use oxygen isotopes as these reflect directly water molecule rather than solute concentrations and have the added advantage of providing a palaeohydrological record in lacustrine carbonates. We present a steady-state, stable-isotope model, in conjunction with stable isotopic measurements of sub-surface brines, regional groundwaters and carbonate deposits from the Lake Malata-Lake Greenly plays complex in South Australia, to estimate the apparent leakage and palaeoleakage from these superficially closed playa lakes. The steady-state model calculations, using the present delta(18)O and delta(2)H compositions of the lake brines and inflowing groundwater, suggest that the apparent present-day leakage for the complex is 75 to 90% of inflow (similar to 35 times that calculated from Cl- and Br-). Under such conditions, only low magnesian calcite precipitates and the lake water experiences reduced effects of evaporation, gas and vapour exchange and, consequently, reduced isotopic and chemical enrichment. Further, our model shows that calcite becomes increasingly Mg-rich until leakage is reduced to similar to 55 to 70% of inflow - a condition favourable for dolomitisation. delta(18)O and delta(13)C of the lacustrine carbonates show excursions on the order of 5 parts per thousand over the length of a 2.3 m core, indicating thar the lake complex has varied from being throughflow dominated (presence of low Mg-calcite relatively depleted in delta(18)O and delta(13)C) to evaporation dominated thigh Mg-calcite/dolomite relatively enriched in delta(18)O and delta(13)C) throughout late Quaternary. Our estimates of leakage fractions are consistent with the observed mineralogical suite, but there remains a discrepancy between apparent closure indicated by the presence of the highly saline brine reservoir (< 1% leakage) and high rates of throughflow inferred from stable isotope data. We propose that the brine was formed by winter time re-solution of a seasonal halite crust which forms during summer dominated evaporative discharge. Recirculation of the secondary brine, and mixing with regional groundwater may decouple the solute cycle from the water cycle in many playa lakes. The end result is a partially mixed brine characterised by nearly conserved solutes but with isotopic signatures indicative of brine-rainfall-groundwater interactions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The short-term spring emission of methane as ice melts in tundra lakes of the region under consideration is determined with consideration for published estimates of the rate of generation of methane in northern-latitude lakes during the cold season.

The record reveals the persistence of steppic landscapes until 10,340 cal yr BP, prevailing sclerophyll woodland with evergreen Quercus until 6,300 cal yr BP, predominance of montane conifers (Cedrus and Cupressaceae) until 1,300 cal yr BP with matorralization and increased fire activity from 4,320 cal yr BP, and major reduction of forest cover after 1,300 cal yr BP. Detailed comparisons between the pollen record of Lake Sidi Ali (2,080m a.s.l.) and previously published data from nearby Tigalmamine (1,626m a.s.l.) highlight common patterns of vegetation change in response to Holocene climatic and anthropogenic drivers, as well as local differences relating to elevation and bioclimate contrasts between the sites. Variability in evergreen Quercus and Cedrus at both sites supports a Holocene summer temperature maximum between 9,000 and 7,000 cal yr BP in contrast with previous large-scale pollen-based climate reconstructions, and furthermore indicates pervasive millennial temperature variability. Millennial-scale cooling episodes are inferred from Cedrus expansion around 10,200, 8,200, 6,100, 4,500, 3,000, and 1,700 cal yr BP, and during the Little Ice Age (400 cal yr BP). A two-part trajectory of Late Holocene forest decline is evident, with gradual decline from 4,320 cal yr BP linked to synergism between pastoralism, increased fire and low winter rainfall, and a marked reduction from 1,300 cal yr BP, attributed to intensification of human activity around the Early Muslim conquest of Morocco. This trajectory, however, does not mask vegetation responses to millennial climate variability. The findings reveal the sensitive response of Middle Atlas forests to rapid climate changes and underscore the exposure of the montane forest ecosystems to future warming.					; Joannin, Sebastien/C-8324-2012	Fletcher, William/0000-0001-8918-0690; Joannin, Sebastien/0000-0001-8345-9252; Zielhofer, Christoph/0000-0001-9551-4466; Hughes, Philip/0000-0002-8284-0219													2296-701X					SEP 27	2017	5								113	10.3389/fevo.2017.00113	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2017.00113													WOS:000451590100001

Balancing Conservation and Economic Development	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												This study assessed the fish community assemblages and potential threats to fish biodiversity within the Murchison Falls-Albert Delta Wetland System (MFADWS), a biodiversity hotspot in the Murchison Falls National Park, Albertine Graben. The MFADWS, extending from Murchison Falls to the Albert Delta in Uganda, supports diverse species, including fish, birds, reptiles, amphibians and mammals, all of which are vital to the livelihoods of surrounding communities. Sampling was conducted in three sections: upstream (Zipper), midstream (Delta) and downstream (Lake Albert) from April 2013 to March 2014 and October 2017 to September 2018. A total of 52 fish species were recorded, with the Zipper and Delta exhibiting greater diversity compared to Lake Albert. Among the recorded species, 43 were classified as Least Concern, seven as Not Evaluated, two as Data Deficient and one (Lates macrophthalmus), endemic to Lake Albert as vulnerable. The Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H ') was highest in the Zipper (3.4 +/- 009), followed by the Delta (2.94 +/- 0.31) and lowest in Lake Albert (2.19 +/- 0.0). The higher biodiversity in the Zipper and Delta underscores the ecological significance of these protected areas. However, the study identified potential threats to the fish biodiversity, including illegal fishing, invasive aquatic weeds and the expansion of oil and gas developments in the Albertine Graben. To safeguard the region's biodiversity, strict enforcement of existing regulations, strengthened monitoring, control and surveillance measures, implementation of biodiversity action plans and protection of critical fish habitats are proposed, to balance biodiversity conservation with local livelihoods and economic developments.

IonPac AS-23 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was applied as analytical column. For the suppression of baseline electroconductivity, an external mode was applied to reduce the baseline noise of chromatograms. The eluent concentration was reduced to half from the recommended condition for an effective separation of the peak of methylphosphonate from those of major anions (sulfate, phosphate, and nitrate). As the peak area linearly increased with an increase in the sample injection volume up to 5 mL, this volume was applied for the analysis of natural samples. The peak area showed a linear increase from 0 to 10 nmol L-1 (R-2 = 0.9982). The detection limit was 5 pmol L-1 (S/N = 3). Methylphosphonate was clearly detected in samples from anoxic spring water and from that of R. Amano close to that spring with a concentration of 2.9 nmol L-1 and 2.3 nmol L-1, respectively.

N2O fluxes from the littoral zone of a Chinese reservoir	BIOGEOSCIENCES												There have been few studies of greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs, despite the remarkable growth in the number of reservoirs in developing countries. We report a case study that focuses on the littoral zone of a major Chinese reservoir, where we established measurements of N2O fluxes using the static chamber technique at five different water levels (deep water, shallow water, seasonally flooded, control for seasonally flooded, and non-flooded). The "control for seasonal flooded" had similar vegetation to the "seasonally flooded" but was not actually flooded as it was on a higher piece of land. Seasonal, diurnal and spatial variations of N2O flux and environmental factors were monitored throughout the growing season which included a flood event during summer rains. The N2O flux ranged from 136.6 to 381.8 mu g m(-2) h(-1) averaging 6.8 mu g m(-2) h(-1). Seasonal and spatial variation was significant but diurnal variation was not. Non-flooded dry land emitted more N2O than flooded land, no matter whether it was permanently or seasonally flooded. Piecewise correlation was found between N2O flux, air temperature and soil nitrate concentration. Positive correlation was shown between N2O flux and dissolved oxygen in water. There were significantly higher emissions from farmland. We compared these results with our recently published study of CH4 emissions, carried out simultaneously at the same site as those in the present study. Completely different patterns between the two gases are demonstrated. We conclude that the littoral zone is a hotspot for N2O emissions in the summer, especially when the shores of the lake are used for the farming of maize. But in terms of the overall greenhouse gas budget, the fluxes of N2O are not as important as those of CH4.

We measured sizes and overlaps of home ranges and core areas. Average size of home range did not differ greatly between years, and location of individual home ranges remained stable from one year to the next in two of three turtles studied both years. Within individual home ranges, the distribution of locations of most turtles was aggregated, but was not significantly different from Poisson distributions. Home ranges overlapped, but the proportion of areas used intensively by individuals was not different in overlapping and nonoverlapping areas, indicating that the areas of intensive use were not exclusive. However, the turtles spaced themselves farther apart than expected from the geometry of the home ranges, possibly the result of intraspecific aggression. If territory is defined as a fixed, exclusive, defended area, then male snapping turtles are not territorial during the summer, but occupy relatively stable home ranges which overlap, and whole spacing may in part be determined by aggressive interactions.

The results of our study suggest that the sources of the C16 n-FA in the two forms are different, whereas both free and bound C28 n-FA originate from terrestrial plants. The dD of combined (free plus bound) C28 n-FA in the 200?m sediment core shows a large variability, with relatively low and high values during the glacial and interglacial periods, respectively. Based on comparison of our record with other marine and lacustrine paleoclimate data, we found that the sedimentary record of C28 n-FA dD likely reflects the temperature-induced change in dD of summer precipitation. This finding suggests that dD values of C28 n-FA could be used as a proxy for summer paleotemperatures in the sediments of Lake Biwa and other lakes. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Horel, JD; Powell, JT				Horel, John d.; Powell, James t.			Analysis and Prediction of Summer Rainfall over Southwestern Utah	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												While many studies have examined intense rainfall and fl ash fl ooding during the North American monsoon (NAM) in Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico, less attention has focused on the NAM ' s extension into southwestern Utah. This study relates fl ash fl ood reports and Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) precipitation across southwestern Utah to atmospheric moisture content and instability analyses and forecasts from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model during the 2021 - 23 monsoon seasons. MRMS quantitative precipitation estimates over southwestern Utah during the summer depend largely on the areal coverage from the KICX WSR-88D radar near Cedar City, Utah. Those estimates are generally consistent with the limited number of precipitation gauge reports in the region except at extended distances from the radar. A strong relationship is evident between days with widespread precipitation and afternoons with aboveaverage precipitable water (PWAT) and convective available potential energy (CAPE) estimated from HRRR analyses across the region. Time-lagged ensembles of HRRR forecasts (initialization times from 0300 to 0600 UTC) that are 13 - 18 h prior to the afternoon period when convection is initiating (1800 - 2100 UTC) are useful for situational awareness of widespread precipitation events after adjusting for underprediction of afternoon CAPE. Improved skill is possible using random forest classi fl cation relying only on PWAT and CAPE to predict days experiencing excessive (upper quartile) precipitation. Such HRRR predictions may be useful for forecasters at the Salt Lake City National Weather Service Forecast Of fl ce to assist in issuing fl ash fl ood potential statements for visitors to national parks and other recreational areas in the region.																			0882-8156	1520-0434				JUL	2024	39	7					1007	1021		10.1175/WAF-D-24-0018.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/WAF-D-24-0018.1													WOS:001266358000003

Pre-vious mechanic researches have demonstrated the different release rates of nutrients in different stages, e.g., the fast-leaching stage (in initial 4-10 days), the microbe conditioning stage with slow decay rate (from winter to spring with low temperature). Nevertheless, models for predicting these processes are still not available and the conventional used model inherently assumes a constant relative release rate. Here, we conducted a one-year in -situ decomposition experiment using the conventional (net) litterbag technique. The credibility of experimental data is increased by using fresh debris to avoid alternation of material traits caused by the conventional drying pretreatment, which is originally used in experiments for terrestrial debris. Our results demonstrated that the carbon release process showed an obvious three-stage pattern, which can be universally depicted by a piecewise three-stage exponential decaying model (r2 > 0.9). More importantly, contributions of the three key factor (i.e., leaching, microbe and macroinvertebrate) can be explicitly reflected by the corresponding relative release rate (ki, i denote i th decomposition stage), which variate greatly between different stages, with k1/k2 > 11.8 and k3/ k2 > 2.63. More importantly, k3 can be further conveniently decomposed into microbe-induced k3-1 and macroinvertebrate-induced k3-2, correspondingly. Also, k3-2 showed an exponential increase with the number of macroinvertebrate (r2 > 0.95). The contributions of the microbe and macroinvertebrate can then be depicted by these two parameters. In conclusion, our model greatly increases the model realism and generality in simulating the carbon release process; Also, the explicit physical meaning of model parameters make the model mechanism clearer. This not only created the chance to further develop a mechanism-based model, but also facilitate the mechanistic study of the impacts of environmental factors (e.g., pH, dissolved oxygen) on k1, k2, k3-1 and k3-2 concerning different kinds of macrophyte, in which the parameters k1, k2, k3-1 and k3-2 acts as important ecological indicators in depicting the relative release rates caused by specific driving forces. These ecological indicators facilitate the future mechanical researches for the impacts of environmental factors on the carbon release.

Body size and condition, age and catch-and-release injury of ice-angled cisco (Coregonus artedi) from four connected lakes in Saskatchewan, Canada	AQUACULTURE, FISH AND FISHERIES												The lake cisco (Coregonus artedi) is not often caught by recreational anglers in open-water in western Canada but becomes a common component of catch-and-release ice fisheries in the winter. Little is known about the composition of recreational cisco fisheries or factors that affect the success of winter catch and release. We examined the size and body condition of 555 cisco caught by anglers in four interconnected lakes in southern Saskatchewan, Canada. We also examined the influence of length on the probability of hooking injuries and determined the age of a subset of angled fish. Cisco caught by anglers ranged in total length from 24 to 48 cm and 110 to 1370 g mass; however, 60.2% of cisco caught ranged from 37 to 40 cm and 470 to 560 g. The scale ages of cisco caught by anglers ranged from 4 to 10 years, with the most common ages caught being 6-8 years; however, scales likely underestimated age beginning around 8 years. Overall, cisco from our four study lakes had lower body conditions compared to Lake Superior populations based on standard weight comparisons. The length, mass, age and body condition of cisco caught by anglers varied significantly among our four study lakes, following a west-to-east productivity gradient. Of the 555 cisco assessed, 54 (9.7%) experienced gill bleeding and 21 (3.8%) had other visible hooking injuries. Longer cisco had a significantly increased probability of gill bleeding, but length did not affect the probability of other injuries. Cisco are relatively slow growing in our study area and warrant more consideration from a catch-and-release angling perspective.					; Somers, Christopher/AAE-6390-2019	Stewart, Julee/0000-0002-8903-2302; 													2693-8847					JUN	2024	4	3							e181	10.1002/aff2.181	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aff2.181													WOS:001249235200001

Resurgence of Cisco (Coregonus artedi) in Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In recent decades, many factors that were linked with the decline of Great Lakes cisco (Coregonus artedi) populations have subsided. The goal of this study was to investigate where cisco exist in Lake Michigan and evaluate evidence for recovery including when, where, and to what extent it is occurring. We evaluated datasets from several independent monitoring efforts that did and did not target cisco. We also evaluated trends in commercial and recreational catches of cisco. Across these datasets, there was strong evidence of a sustained recovery of cisco stocks that began in Lake Michigan in the mid-2000s. Fall gill net surveys and commercial fisheries provided reasonable indications of a population recovery in the northeast by 2011. Further south, Ludington Pump Storage barrier net monitoring also recorded increasing numbers of cisco starting in 2011. Recreational harvest estimates were valuable in evaluating spatial distributions but were less valuable as an early signal of abundance shifts. Measures of the recreational harvest of cisco most notably increased in 2014. The highest catch rates and harvest occurred in Grand Traverse Bay and northern Lake Michigan as evidenced by recreational, commercial, and fall netting surveys. Observations of cisco are expanding and have increased in intensity along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan south to Muskegon in both fishery dependent and independent surveys. The similarity in trends from all data sources indicate that cisco abundance has increased, and their range within the basin continues to expand.

Differences in growth and survivorship of zebra and quagga mussels: size matters	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and its congener the quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) are both invaders in freshwater, but have very different invasion histories, with zebra mussels attaining substantially faster rates of spread at virtually all spatial scales. However, in waterbodies where they co-occur, D. r. bugensis can displace D. polymorpha. To determine if the mechanisms for this displacement are associated with different survival and growth, we kept mussels in flow-through tanks for 289 days with two temperature regimes that mimicked the natural surface water (littoral zone) and hypolimnion conditions of Lake Erie. For the littoral zone regime, we used water directly from the surface of Lake Erie (range 4-25A degrees C, average 11.9 +/- A 0.6A degrees C). For the profundal zone treatment, Lake Erie surface water was chilled to about 6A degrees C (range 5-8A degrees C, average 6.2 +/- A 0.6A degrees C) for the full duration of the experiment. For each of these temperature regimes, we used three replicate tanks with only zebra mussels present and three replicate tanks with only quagga mussels (150 ind./tank each), and three replicate tanks with both species (75 ind./tank of each species). Quagga mussels had higher survivorship and grew more than zebra mussels in all treatments. For both species, the size of the mussel entering the winter was critical for survivorship. Larger mussels had a higher survival over the winter in all treatments. For both species, there was a survivorship and growth tradeoff. In the warmer littoral zone treatment both species had higher growth, but lower survival than in the colder profundal zone treatment. Surprisingly, although quagga mussels outperformed zebra mussels, zebra mussel survivorship was better when they were faced with competition by quagga mussels than with just intraspecific competition. In addition, quagga mussels suffered size-specific mortality during the growing season only when facing interspecific competition with zebra mussels. Further experiments are needed to determine the possible mechanisms for these interspecific effects.					; Mastitsky, Sergey/E-7668-2010	Burlakova, Lyubov/0000-0002-2995-919X; Padilla, Dianna/0000-0002-5530-9131; Mastitsky, Sergey/0000-0002-1068-4579													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2011	668	1					183	194		10.1007/s10750-010-0533-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0533-z													WOS:000290177300014
J	Niu, FJ; Lin, ZJ; Liu, H; Lu, JH				Niu, Fujun; Lin, Zhanju; Liu, Hua; Lu, Jiahao			Characteristics of thermokarst lakes and their influence on permafrost in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau	GEOMORPHOLOGY												About 250 thermokarst lakes, with an average size of 5580 m(2) and a total size of 139 x 10(4)m(2), are spread between the Kunlun Mountain pass and the Fenghuo Mountain pass along the Qinghai-Tibet railway, where ice-rich and warm permafrost exists. Approximately 56% of the lakes are elliptical and 23% are elongated. The water depth varies between 0.4 and 3 m. Most of the lakes in the Chumarhe High Plain and other mountain regions are shallower than the thickness of winter ice (60 to 80 cm), and are frozen to the bottom during the cold seasons. However, in the Hoh Xil Hill region and Beiluhe basin, the water depth is greater than the thickness of winter ice and the relatively warm lake bottoms can cause considerable disturbance to the surrounding continuous permafrost. The lakes in the Chumarhe High Plain are saltwater or brine lakes; and in other regions, the lakes contain freshwater or brackish water. Ages of formation, enlargement rates, water and lake-bottom temperatures, the configuration of permafrost, and active-layer thickness were measured at a typical thermokarst lake in the Beiluhe basin between 2007 and 2009. The lake formed about 890 years ago and is 150 m long, 100 m wide, with a water depth of 2.5 m now. The size of the lake is growing at a rate of about 1 m/a at some shores. The lakeshores are underlain by permafrost, which terminates almost vertically at their edge. The mean annual temperature measured at lake bottom in the centre was 5.45 degrees C, while the temperature of permafrost at 15 m depth in the lakeshore varied from -0.84 degrees C near the edge of the lake to -1.26 degrees C at 80 m from the edge. The corresponding active layer depths varied from 2.45 to 1.80 m. The configuration of the talik indicates that no permafrost is found beneath the centre of the lake.

J	Jones, JR; Pollard, C; Obrecht, D				Jones, John R.; Pollard, Carol; Obrecht, Daniel, V			Factors influencing phosphorus in midcontinent impoundments (USA) and challenges for detecting abatement	INLAND WATERS												Impoundments in the midcontinent region of the United States provide the beneficial services of lentic waters. These impoundments were constructed long after intensified agriculture was established, and most are eutrophic. Total phosphorus (TP) increases in regional streams and reservoirs, concurrent with the proportion of cropland in the watershed, serve as a surrogate for nutrient loading from agriculture. The potential impact of external loading of TP to these reservoirs is moderated by sedimentation of particulate P and plunging interflows during summer stratification. Hydrology has a strong influence on TP; cross-system analyses show TP more than doubles across the range of flushing rates found in Missouri reservoirs when other factors are held constant. This link between hydrology and TP suggests reservoir placement on the landscape and design criteria strongly influence trophic state. Temporal variation is such that summer mean TP typically ranges 2- or 3-fold in individual reservoirs, suggesting benefits of best management practices to reduce external loading may be masked by inherent variation. Eutrophication of a midcontinent reservoir from poultry litter has been documented. Expansion of industrialized animal production throughout the region suggests legacy P, and resulting eutrophication, will likely increase over time without regulation.

Watershed monitoring showed that levels of total manganese (Mn) and total iron (Fe) were high (Mn 0.14-0.64 mg/L; Fe 5.3-12.4 mg/L) during the first flood of the wet season in river sampling stations near historical pyrite mining operations. Monitoring in the reservoir showed that Mn and Fe were present in bottom waters throughout the year, with peak levels (> 8 mg/L of Mn and > 30 mg/L of Fe) coinciding with low levels of oxygen in summer months. Empirical modeling of Mn concentration in the reservoir water column showed that it correlated significantly with Fe (positive correlation), redox potential (negative correlation) and dissolved oxygen (negative correlation). Statistical evaluation of the temporal cycle of Mn in raw water delivered to the Juan Gonzales Water Treatment Plant showed that Mn accumulation was highly seasonal, peaking annually around September when dissolved oxygen in raw water was at a minimum. Data suggest that during first-flood conditions early in the wet season, mass loading of Mn and Fe from the watershed to the reservoir is high. During the subsequent drier low-flow summer period, external mass loading of metals drops dramatically and the reservoir becomes a large exporter of Mn and Fe as the metals are internally recycled under anaerobic conditions in bottom waters.					; Gebremariam, Seyoum/AAC-6197-2022	Betancourt, Carmen/0000-0002-7977-9517; 													1040-2381	2151-5530					2010	26	3					217	226		10.1080/07438141.2010.519856	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438141.2010.519856													WOS:000288116800007
J	Nicklisch, A				Nicklisch, A			Competition between the cyanobacterium Limnothrix redekei and some spring species of diatoms under P-limitation	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												The nutrient saturated growth and the competition between Limnothrix redekei and some spring diatoms for phosphate were studied in semi-continuous cultures at 10 degrees C with a 6/18 h light/dark cycle and at 15 degrees C with a 12/12 light/dark cycle. Under these conditions in unialgal cultures, the maximum specific growth rate of Limnothrix redekei was two to three time lower than that of the diatoms. However, Limnothrix redekei was the superior competitor for phosphate under both conditions in mixed cultures. The diatoms in mixed cultures from each species with Limnothrix redekei were competitively displaced but at a different rate. This allowed the diatoms to be ranked in terms of their competitive ability for phosphate at 10 OC as follows: Synedra acus > Asterionella formosa > Stephanodiscus minutulus > Nitzschia acicularis > Cyclotella meneghiniana > Stephanodiscus neoastrea > Stephanodiscus hantzschii. The competitive ability of Linnothrix redekei at 15 OC was increased and the rank order of diatoms slightly changed. The hypothesis that cyanobacteria are promoted by phosphate because they are inferior competitors for phosphate is incorrect for Limnothrix redekei.																			1434-2944						1999	84	3					233	241																WOS:000081091900002

Defining and classifying migratory habitats as sources and sinks: The migratory pathway approach	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Understanding and conserving migratory species requires a method for characterizing the seasonal flow of animals among habitats. Source-sink theory describes the metapopulation dynamics of species by classifying habitats as population sources (i.e. net contributors) or sinks (i.e. net substractors). Migratory species may have non-breeding habitats important to the species (e.g. overwintering or stopover habitats) that traditional source-sink theory would classify as sinks because these habitats produce no individuals. Conversely, existing migratory network models can evaluate the relative contribution of non-breeding nodes, but these models make an equilibrium assumption that is difficult to meet when examining real migratory populations. 2. We extend a pathway-based metric allowing breeding habitats, non-breeding habitats and migratory pathways connecting these habitats to be classified as sources or sinks. Rather than being based on whether place-or season-specific births exceed deaths, our approach quantifies the total demographic contribution from a node or migratory pathway over a flexibly defined yet limited time period across an organism's life cycle. As such, it provides a snapshot of a migratory system and therefore does not require assumptions associated with equilibrium dynamics. 3. We first develop a generalizable mathematical notation and then demonstrate how the metric may be used with two case studies: the common loon (Gavia immer) and Yellowstone cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri). These examples highlight how stressors can impact stopover and wintering habitats (loons) and habitat management targeting migratory pathways can improve population status (trout). 4. Synthesis and applications. Each of the two case studies presented describes how effects at one location are felt by populations in another through the seasonal flow of individuals. The contribution metric we present should be helpful in allocating regulatory and management attention to times and locations most critical to migratory species persistence.

Crisis Water Management and Ibis Breeding at Narran Lakes in Arid Australia	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Narran Lakes is a Ramsar site recognised for its importance for colonial waterbird breeding, which only occurs after large highly variable flooding events. In 2008, 74,095 pairs of ibis bred for the first time in seven years, establishing two contiguous colonies, a month apart. Most (97%) of the colony consisted of the straw-necked ibis (Threskiornis spinicollis) with the remainder consisting of glossy ibis (2%, Plegadis falcinellus) and Australian white ibis (1%, T. molucca). Following cessation of river flows, water levels fell rapidly in the colony site, resulting in a crisis management decision by governments to purchase and deliver water (10,423 Ml) to avert mass desertion of the colonies. There were significant differences in the reproductive success of each colony. In colony 1 60% of eggs hatched and 94% of chicks fledged, while in colony 2 40% of eggs hatched with only 17% of chicks fledging. Statistical analyses found that water depth was a significant variable in determining reproductive success. Rapid falls in water level during the chick stage in colony 2 resulted in decreased chick and overall offspring success. The results of this study identify the impact of upstream water resource development on colonial waterbird breeding and have implications for water management policies.

J	Liu, G; Xu, N; Yu, CY				Liu, Gang; Xu, Na; Yu, Chongyang			Comparative analysis of the microbiome of sympatric wintering Bean Geese, Domestic Ducks, humans, and soil at Shengjin Lake of China reveals potential public risk to human health	AVIAN RESEARCH												The gut microbiota of migratory waterbirds is affected by various complex factors, including cross-species transmission, which increases the risk of pathogen spreading among sympatric animals and poses a potential public health risk to humans. In this study, we investigated the microbial communities of wintering Bean Geese (Anser fabalis), Domestic Ducks (A. platyrhynchos domesticus), humans, and soil using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene region in Shengjin Lake, China. In total, 6,046,677 clean reads were obtained, representing 41,119 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) across the four groups. The dominant microbial phyla were the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidota, and Actinobacteriota. The Sorensen similarity index and alpha and beta diversity results showed that the gut microbial communities of Bean Geese and Domestic Ducks were more similar to those of the other pairs. Network analysis revealed that Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Pseudomonas fragi, and Bradyrhizobium elkanii were hubs of the three major modules. Fourteen common microbiomes were identified in Bean Geese, Domestic Ducks, humans, and soil in Shengjin Lake. A total of 96 potential pathogens were identified among the four groups, with 20 specific potentially pathogenic microbiomes found in the gut of Bean Geese. Some of these pathogens are responsible for significant financial losses in the poultry industry and pose risks to human health. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Escherichia coli, and Ralstonia insidiosa are potential core pathogens found in the four groups at Shengjin Lake that can cause diseases in humans and animals and facilitate cross-species transmission through various media. Therefore, humans are at risk of contracting these pathogens from migratory birds because of their frequent contact with domestic poultry. However, further studies are required to explore the potential pathogenic species and transmission pathways among sympatric wintering Bean Geese, Domestic Ducks, humans, and soil.																			2053-7166						2024	15								100175	10.1016/j.avrs.2024.100175	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.avrs.2024.100175													WOS:001228911600001
J	Yang, W; Guo, XF; Wang, YJ				Yang, Wei; Guo, Xiaofeng; Wang, Yongjie			Observational evidence of the combined influence of atmospheric circulations and local factors on near-surface meteorology in Dagze Co basin, inner Tibetan Plateau	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Based on meteorological observations of three automatic weather stations (AWSs), spanning an altitudinal range of 1400 m from 4480 to 5880 m above sea level (m a.s.l.) during August 2015 to August 2016, this study presents a description of the spatio-temporal characteristics of the near-surface meteorology of the Dagze Co (lake) basin in the interior of the Tibetan Plateau. We also investigated the influence of synoptic atmospheric systems and local factors on the meteorological characteristics. We found that the onset and withdrawal of the South Asian summer monsoon triggered seasonal shift in meteorological variables including wind direction, precipitation, and relative humidity. In addition, the magnitude of various meteorological factors during the monsoonal period is clearly associated with the intensity of the South Asian summer monsoon, which subsequently controls the lake water budget of Dagze Co. Moreover, both the local topography and the existence of the lake contribute significantly to the altitudinal variation of several meteorological factors. For example, the orographic precipitation near the glaciated area at 5880 m a.s.l. was about three times greater than in the area adjacent to the lake. The dominating katabatic wind over these glaciated areas weakens the up-valley wind and consequently wind speed tends to decrease with increasing elevation during the monsoonal season. In addition, different levels of cloudiness between the low-altitude lake and the glaciated mountain area contribute to a 40-50% reduction in incoming short-wave radiation receipt. Our observations will hopefully contribute to future glacio-hydrological studies and will help to evaluate statistically/dynamically downscaled climate fields in the interior of Tibetan Plateau which contains numerous lakes and glaciers.

Here, we evaluate the controls of CDOM during two summers with strongly contrasting values of the Palmer drought index (PDI), indicating wet vs. dry conditions. We hypothesized that lake CDOM during a wet summer season is regulated mainly by the surrounding land cover to which the lakes are hydrologically connected, while, during drought, the lakes are disconnected from the catchment and CDOM is regulated by climatic and morphometric factors that govern the internal turnover of CDOM in the lakes. A suite of climate, land cover, and morphometric variables was assembled and used to explain remotely sensed CDOM values for 255 boreal lakes distributed across broad environmental and geographic gradients in Sweden and Norway. We found that PDI explained the variability in CDOM among lakes in a dry year, but not in a wet year, and that severe drought strongly decreased CDOM during the dry year. Large lakes, especially, with a presumed high degree of catchment uncoupling, showed low CDOM during the dry year. However, in disagreement with our hypothesis, climate, land cover, and morphometry all showed a stronger impact on lake CDOM in wet vs. dry years. Thus, drought systematically weakened the predictability of CDOM variations at the same time as CDOM was offset toward lower values. Our results show that drought not only has a direct effect on CDOM, but also acts indirectly by changing the spatial regulation of CDOM in boreal lakes.

J	Park, GS				Park, Gyung Soo			The role and distribution of total suspended solids in the macrotidal coastal waters of Korea	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Spatial and temporal distribution patterns of total suspended solids (TSS) in the shallow and macrotidal regions of the Korean peninsula indicated there were significant changes in TSS concentrations. These were seasonally influenced by the wind, river input and tidal cycle. There were high TSS values at estuarine and river mouth stations and during low tide due to the re-suspension of bottom sediment by strong wind action during winter months, in addition the land input through rivers and strong tidal current during ebbing. Monthly mean values of TSS significantly correlated with wind speed and nitrate concentration (p < 0.01). This indicated that the resuspension of surface sediment was a more important source of TSS than the river input, and that nitrate was introduced into the water column during the resuspension process. TSS were seven times higher at low tide than in high tide. Light penetration was significantly inhibited by TSS; as > 98% of incident light was absorbed within 2 m and zero photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) under 2 m in the estuarine stations during winter. Removal of heavy metals and nutrients by TSS in the water column was evident. Over 80% of the initial concentration of nutrients was removed within 10 min under various concentrations of TSS and also TSS contained significantly higher concentration of heavy metals than surface sediment. The concentration levels of nutrients and chemical oxygen demand in the west coast were comparable with the East and South Sea, even the major rivers in the Korean peninsula flow into the West Sea with major pollutant loadings into the coastal areas. High concentration of TSS is likely to contribute to the removal process of these pollutants, resulting in relatively lower levels of nutrients and organic materials in these coastal waters.																			0167-6369					DEC	2007	135	1-3					153	162		10.1007/s10661-007-9640-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-007-9640-3								17342435					WOS:000250839800016

This eruptive period was characterized by the occurrence of 4 explosive eruptive phases, dominated by low-intensity phreatic activity, which produced almost permanent gas/steam columns (200-800 m height over the active crater). Those columns presented frequently scarce ash, and were interrupted by phreatic explosions that produced ash columns 1,000-3,000 m height in the more intense periods. Eruptive plumes were transported in several directions (NW, N, NE, E and SE), but more than half of the time the plume axis was 130-150 degrees E, and reached a distance up to 638 km from the active crater. Tephra fall deposits identified in the NW, N, NE, E and SE flanks covered an area of 1,265 km(2), thickness variable from 4 m (SE border of active crater) to similar to 0.5 cm 36.8 km SE and similar to 8 km NW from active crater, respectively, corresponding to a minimum volume of 0.0088 km(3). Tephra fall deposit is exclusively constituted of no juvenile fragments including: lithics fragments as main component, quartz and plagioclase crystals, some oxidized lithics, and occasional presence of Fe oxide, and less frequently Cu minerals, as single fragments. We present new field-based measurements data of the geochemistry of gas/water from fumaroles and acid crater lakes, and fall deposit analysis, that integrated with the eruptive record and GOES satellite data, suggests that the eruptive period 2010-2011 has been related to an increasing of heat and mass transfer from hydrothermal-magmatic reservoirs, which would have been favoured by the formation and/or reactivation of cracks after 8.8 Mw Maule earthquake in February 2010. This process also allowed the ascent of fluids from a shallow hydrothermal source, dominated by reduced species as H2S and CH4, during the entire eruptive period, and the release of more oxidizing fluids from a deep magmatic reservoir, dominated by acid species as SO2, HCl and HF, increasing strongly after the end of the eruptive period, probably since October 2011. The eruptive period was scored with a magnitude of 3.36, corresponding to a VEI 1-2.					; Romero, Jorge Eduardo/E-1044-2016; Benavente, Oscar/JMC-6663-2023; F., Francisco/K-7192-2013; Tapia, Rodrigo/O-4251-2015; Romero, Jorge/E-1044-2016; Gonzalez T., Rodrigo/O-4251-2015	Aguilera, Felipe/0000-0003-1135-9978; Romero, Jorge Eduardo/0000-0001-9383-9830; Agusto, Mariano/0000-0001-6037-8492; Gonzalez T., Rodrigo/0000-0001-7553-9404													0718-7106					JAN	2016	43	1					20	46		10.5027/andgeoV43n1-a02	http://dx.doi.org/10.5027/andgeoV43n1-a02													WOS:000369149500002

Integrated ecological and paleolimnological research as a basis for more exact palaeoecological inferences, however, is lacking almost completely so far. Here, we report the Pediastrum concentration and taxon composition in surface sediment samples from 36 large lakes (area >100 ha) and 32 ponds (area <1 ha) covering broad summer temperature and salinity gradients on the Tibetan Plateau, and additionally study 23 assemblages from the large freshwater lake Taro Co. Pediastrum algae are identified as relatively common algal compound of the still pristine alpine freshwater ecosystems. A salinity of similar to 2 g l(-1) TDS seems to inhibit the growth of most of the Pediastrum taxa already. No large overall differences in the taxonomic inventory of ponds and large lakes are detected. The in-lake variation of assemblages in Taro Co is low. Factors driving the species composition of assemblages, however, seem to differ between both ecosystem types. Whereas taxonomic shifts in Pediastrum assemblages from ponds occur along the summer temperature gradient, shifts in taxon composition along the salinity gradient indicate the possible use of the algae group as an indicator for past salinity changes in large lakes.

Checklist of aquatic Diptera (Insecta) of Plitvice Lakes National Park, Croatia, a UNESCO world heritage site	ZOOKEYS												Studies on aquatic Diptera in the Plitvice Lakes National Park (Croatia) conducted in the last 50 years have produced 157 species and 7 taxa of aquatic Diptera placed in 13 families. Samples were collected at 25 sampling sites representing the four main types of karst aquatic habitats: spring, stream, tufa barriers and lakes. All records of all the aquatic families of Diptera in Plitvice Lakes NP are summarized, including previously unpublished data. Twelve species new for Plitvice Lakes NP are recorded for the first time, belonging to the families: Chironomidae - Labrundinia longipalpis (Goetghebuer, 1921), Nilothauma brayi (Goetghebuer, 1921), Ponhastia longimanus Kieffer, 1922, Polypedilum (Polypedilum) nubeculosum (Meigen, 1804), Tanytarsus brundini Lindeberg, 1963; Dixidae - Dixella autumnalis (Meigen, 1838); Scathophagidae - Acanthocnema latipennis Becker, 1894 and Stratiomyidae - Oxycera pardalina Meigen, 1822, Oxycera limbata Loew, 1862, Oxycera turcica Ustuner & Hasbenli, 2004, Nemotelus pantherinus (Linnaeus, 1758), Oplodontha viridula (Fabricius, 1775). The most species-rich family was the Chironomidae with 62 species (and an additional seven taxa), followed by the Empididae with 22 species and Limoniidae with 19 species. The highest number of species was recorded in springs. The relatively low number of species in certain families and the complete absence of some aquatic families shows that further research into the aquatic Diptera in Plitvice Lakes NP is needed.

Vertical distribution of perch cohorts and zooplankton were determined at weekly intervals and growth of perch was followed through the summer. Vertical transition occurred during a 1-2 wk period in late July 1972 and late June 1973. Mean length of perch during this transition was 42.8 mm in 1972 and 27.6 mm in 1973. Perch changed from pelagic to demersal at a time when water temperatures were rising rapidly. Seven species of cladocera were observed in 1972, Daphnia retrocurva were abundant in surface water and D. pulex predominated near the bottom. In contrast, only D. pulex was found in 1973, and they tended to concentrate near the surface. The time of transition was not determined by vertical distribution of food zooplankters. Perch ate about equal numbers of cladocera and copepods in 1972 and mostly D. pulex in 1973 during the pelagic stage. They consumed mostly copepods in the transition period, and after they became demersal, D. pulex was the most important food in both years. As the fish increased in size they fed on larger zooplankters in preference to small ones. Growth rates of pelagic fry in 1972 and 1973 were approximately equal despite marked variation in composition and abundance of zooplankters in lake and in perch stomachs. However, during the demersal stage perch grew more rapidly in 1973. Differences in amount of food consumed in late summer of 1972 and 1973 probably contributed to differences in growth rate.																			0001-3943						1983	22	1					13	24																WOS:A1983QB61800002

However, the distribution of Li resources in the western Qaidam Basin is still unclear, and the enrichment mechanism of Li remains to be explained. In this study, we present new hydrochemical data for all the oil-bearing anticlines in the Qaidam Basin. Oilfield waters in the Nanyishan and Dafengshan oilfields are characterized by Li concentrations ranging from 110.1 to 237.5 mg/L, and Mg concentrations ranging from 0.70 to 1.52 g/L. These concentrations are readily recovered and represent a key target for oilfield water exploitation in the future. In oilfield water samples from the Qaidam Basin, delta Li-7 values show large variation, possibly implying multiple sources of Li, including residual water from ancient lakes, alpine snow water infiltrating along deep faults, springs, and deep hydrothermal fluids. delta Li-7 values of the oilfield waters from Nanyishan and Dafengshan are lower than those of the river and spring water samples, but close to those of volcanic rocks around the world. These results indicate that the oilfield waters with significant Li-enrichment are associated with local hydrothermal activity. This is the first time that the delta Li-7 data of oilfield waters in the Qaidam Basin have been reported. It appears that delta Li-7 is a good tracer for determining the origin and the key controlling factors of Li accumulation processes in oilfield waters.

An evaluation of semidistributed-pipe-network and distributed-finite-difference models to simulate karst systems	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Several different approaches have been developed to model the specific characteristics of karst aquifers, taking account of their inherent complex spatial and temporal heterogeneities. This paper sets out the development of a semidistributed modelling approach for applications in an Irish karst context using urban drainage software. The models have proven to be very useful for different studies, with examples given for the ecohydrology of ephemeral karst lakes, extreme groundwater-flood alleviation, karst network investigation, submarine groundwater discharge, and quantification of different recharge and flow components. The limitations of the approach are also highlighted, in particular not being able to simulate diffuse infiltration and flow paths explicitly across the groundwater catchment. Hence, a more distributed, finite-difference modelling approach using MODFLOW Unstructured Grid (USG) with the newly developed Connected Linear Network (CLN) process is then compared against the semidistributed approach on the same karst catchment. Whilst it has proven difficult to achieve the same levels of model performance in simulating the spring flows in the distributed model compared to the semidistributed model, the ability to interrogate the flow paths at any point on the three-dimensional aquifer is demonstrated, which can give new insights into flows (and potential contaminant transport) through such complex systems. The influence of the proximity of highly transmissive conduits on the flow dynamics through the much-lower transmissive matrix cells in which the network is embedded has been particularly investigated.

Historically, low oxygen concentrations created a benthic zone with reduced fish predation pressures which allowed chaoborids to flourish. Population densities of chironomids and oligochaetes were suppressed by prolonged periods of summer anoxia. Benthic macroinvertebrate community diversity values were indicative of poor water quality and/or habitat quality. Following alum treatment and prior to hypolimnetic oxygenation, chaoborid densities doubled. This was due, in part, to changes in trophic structure which provided an abundant food source for early instar chaoborids. In addition, Newman Lake was stocked with fewer trout in 1990 and 1991 resulting in reduced predation on the invertebrate community. Alum treatment had no effect on chironomid or oligochaete populations. Hypolimnetic oxygenation prevented the formation of the anoxic zone and greatly reduced the extent of the hypoxic zone (less than or equal to 4 mg/l dissolved oxygen). During the first year of oxygenation, average available trout habitat expanded deeper into the hypolimnion to include 97% of the lake's total volume during summer stratification. We hypothesize that the expansion of hypolimnetic trout habitat coupled with an increase in the number of rainbow trout stocked in Newman Lake greatly increased fish predation on selected species of bottom organisms. Consequently, merobenthic chaoborids experienced a 90% decline in abundance following oxygenation. Benthic chironomids and oligochaetes benefited from higher dissolved oxygen concentrations, in spite of increased fish predation pressures, and reached their maximum densities 16 to 23 months after oxygenation began.

The research was carried out for a period of 5 years. The horizontal ground heat exchanger is a ground source for a heat pump with the measured average heating output of 9.53 kW and cooling capacity of 7.8 kW, installed in a single-family house located in the north-eastern part of Poland. A heat exchanger with the area of 253 m(2) is located at a depth of 1.9 m in the groundwater layer being in hydraulic contact with the waters of Lake Elk. During the first four years, each year it can be observed that soil of the ground heat source is chilling at a depth of 1.9 m, due to working heat pump. Between January and April heat pump was working with the ground source frozen, where the temperature ranged from -0.6 to -2.1 degrees C. Subsidence and cooling of the soil was caused by a relatively small active area of ground source of heat which was 253 m2 with the dimensions of 11 m x 23 m, as well as inadequate spacing between sections of the spiral heat exchanger amounting to 0.1 m. After operational testing of the heat pump and the ground source of heat, the "microBMS" a control and optimization system, working independently from the heat pump control was introduced into the building in January 2014. Its introduction has significantly increased that lower minimum flow temperature of the heat exchanger to +0.3-0.9 degrees C. There was also an increase of the minimum temperature of the ground source heat exchanger by the value of +1.33.0 degrees C and decrease in cooling of the soil in August-an increase of temperature by about 0.7 degrees C. Operational tests of heat pump system working with an unusual and original application of horizontal spiral heat exchanger have shown that in the first period introduction of an additional heat exchanger was considered. In subsequent years of heat pump operation and after the introduction of its independent monitoring and optimization, the study showed good properties of ground source and its complete recovery in the summer. Ground source, chilled properly to a temperature of about 0 degrees C became a very good cooling reservoir during periods of spring and summer heat. The use of the Earth's heat helps to improve the environment, while in some way it violates the natural thermal and agrophysical condition of the ground. Operation of ground source heat pump affects the periodic changes of agro-thermal parameters of soil. The delay of the vegetation period above the horizontal heat exchanger of heat pump is about 13 days and is caused by postponed thawing of ground observed at 0.05 m.

The AQUATOX model was first implemented using 12 pelagic-benthic populations came from monitoring data obtained in 20 sampling sites at Dianchi Lake between April 2015 and January 2016. At the meantime, PAHs concentration was simultaneously investigated in surface water. According to the characteristics of trophic state, all of sampling sites can be subdivided into four areas: (1) Area I: algae-dense area; (2) Area II: aquatic organism protection area; (3) Area III: littoral zone damaged area; (4) and Area IV: ecosystem recovery area. The result of sensitivity analysis showed that most of populations were very sensitive to optimal temperature and respiration rate. Through calibration and validation analysis, the value of rB is range from 0.142 to 0.331, and the value of F is range from 0.116 to 0.300, which indicated that the model can describe the seasonal variation of 12 dominant populations in Dianchi Lake. Risk assessment showed that Rotifer and Chironomidae populations showed more sensitive for PAHs pollution. For the Rotifer and Copepoda, the loss of biomass caused by PAHs pollution was showed the highest value in Area II, followed by Area III, Area I, and Area IV. For the temporal variation, Rotifer and Copepoda were showed the highest difference values in winter. In additional, the risk can change according to the temporal variation, for Dianchi Lake, more attention should be pay in winter for the pollutants management. The model was effective in estimating the indirect ecological effects of competition, prey -predatory, biomass dilution or other effects passed through the foodweb. Therefore, our study showed that the importance of ecosystem level studies to predict the ecological risk of pollutants.					liu, yong/AAD-1467-2019; Liu, Yong/B-1826-2008	Liu, Yong/0000-0001-8181-1080													0304-3800	1872-7026				NOV 24	2018	388						31	44		10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.09.019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.09.019													WOS:000451354000005

A total of 29 species were collected and 26 of them are classified as new reports for the region. Species with and without reduced swimming setae on the second antenna showed differences in their habitat preferences. The population density of species with setae did not show a significant (p > 0.05) difference between lentic and lotic habitats. However, species without swimming setae are mostly bottom dependent and appear to prefer lotic habitats more than lentic (p < 0.05). Such preference in lotic habitats may enhance their dispersion ability, increasing survival chance in a wide range of habitats. According to results of Canonical Correspondence Analyses (CCA), water (p = 0.004) and air temperatures (p = 0.042) were found as the most influential variables on species where habitat type did not show significant influence. This also coincided with the Spearman correlation analysis which indicated that species with a wide tolerance range to environmental variables and wide geographical distribution portrayed significant correlation to water temperature. Overall, results suggest that populations of swimming species may have the ability of free movement and show successful distribution in different aquatic habitats because of higher species tolerance levels to a variety of biotic/abiotic factors.					; KÜLKÖYLÜOĞLU, OKAN/A-6441-2018; Akdemir, Derya/B-2635-2019	Yavuzatmaca, Mehmet/0000-0002-0398-6763; Akdemir, Derya/0000-0003-1253-3376; 													1863-9135					MAR	2016	187	4					307	314		10.1127/fal/2016/0665	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/fal/2016/0665													WOS:000371826500004

Eleven diadromous and one river resident (introduced Oncorhynchus masou masou) species were found, but absolutely no fish were detected at the 18 above-waterfall sites. Statistical analyses revealed that the presence of waterfalls (> 5 m in height) below the sites had a significant negative effect on fish distribution, suggesting that waterfalls prevent migration of diadromous fishes. We found Rhinogobius brunneus populations above high waterfalls such as Nunobiki Falls (50 m) and Ohko Falls (88 m). Otolith Sr:Ca ratios and mitochondrial DNA (cyt-b region) were examined to determine the migratory history and genetic properties of these populations; the Sr:Ca ratios indicated that the populations had a landlocked life cycle, whereas the genetic endemism/isolation of landlocked populations was unexpectedly absent. There is no clear explanation for this phenomenon, but fairly infrequent individuals of nonlandlocked type might have migrated beyond the waterfalls with their sucker-like organ and mated with landlocked populations, disrupting the genetic isolation of landlocked populations.					; IIDA, Midori/C-4062-2011; Sato, Tatsuro/ISV-3063-2023	NISHIDA, Shin/0009-0006-5719-6771; IIDA, Midori/0000-0002-0294-1985; Kano, Yuichi/0000-0001-7158-753X; Sato, Tatsuro/0000-0003-2817-3723													1341-8998	1616-3915				NOV	2014	61	4					305	316		10.1007/s10228-014-0400-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10228-014-0400-4													WOS:000344740800001

In this study, data were analyzed for viral and prokaryotic abundance, viral production, and viral decay in a subtropical Danshui estuary in summer 2021. Prokaryotic abundance varied from 2.4 +/- 0.6 x 10(5) to 12 +/- 2.3 x 10(5) cells mL(-1), and viral abundance ranged from 2.3 +/- 0.9 x 10(5) to 6.9 +/- 1.3 x 10(5) viruses mL(-1) during the study period. Viral abundance was significantly correlated with prokaryotic abundance and chlorophyll a concentration. Furthermore, studies of changes in viral to prokaryotic abundance ratio (VPR) ranged from 0.42 +/- 0.11 to 2.0 +/- 0.25. Viral decay values were 2.1 +/- 0.5 and 2.1 +/- 0.3 x 10(4) virus mL(-1)h(-1), and non-significant differences were observed between the inner estuary and coastal water region. Viral decay almost balanced gross viral production in this study. The dilution experiments revealed non-significant net viral production in July; thus, a lower VPR might be explained in this estuarine environment.

Scott; Hu, Feng Sheng; Berg, Edward; Werner, Al			Evidence for a variable and wet Younger Dryas in southern Alaska	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Pollen, macro- and micro-fossils, and sedimentologic indicators in sediment cores from Discovery Pond (DP) in south-central Alaska indicate that the coldest interval of the last deglacation was coincident with the onset of the Younger Dryas (YD), around 12.8 cal ka. The multi-proxy record from DP together with a compilation of recently published YD records from southern Alaska and the adjacent northern Pacific Ocean shows that, during the course of the YD, temperatures increased, then reached a maximum sometime around 11 cal ka. At DP, a pronounced increase in the abundance of Isoetes and Pediastrum, including species associated with oligotrophic lakes and known to respond to increased precipitation, combined with a reduction in wetland aquatics and an increase in the minerogenic component of the sediment, all indicate a shift from wetland to open-water conditions at around 12.2 cal ka. Similar to other evidence from southern Alaska, our proxy record from DP indicates an increase in temperature and effective moisture during the second half of the YD. An increase in winter precipitation might be associated with a deepening of the Aleutian low-pressure system and a northward shift in winter storm tracks, consistent with recent simulations by climate system models.

J	Dienst, M; Schmieder, K; Ostendorp, W				Dienst, M; Schmieder, K; Ostendorp, W			Effects of water level variations on the dynamics of the reed belts of Lake Constance	LIMNOLOGICA					Lake Shores 2003 International Conference	JUN 19-21, 2003	Konstanz, GERMANY					On the basis of different sets of aerial photos the dynamics of the reed bed areas of Lake Constance were investigated in relation to the dynamics of the water levels. The objectives of the study were to quantify the changes of reed areas due to different flood events in the last decades and their recovery in the time periods between these events. The results should give information of the relevance of water level variations on reed bed dynamics and the regeneration times of reed beds after extreme disturbance events. Following the extreme flood at Lake Constance in 1999 the reed belts of Lake Constance lost approximately 30 ha (24%) of the takeside reed beds. The loss is comparable to the situation in the late 1960s, when approximately 40 ha died back due to the extreme flood in 1965 and the high spring water levels in the subsequent years. In the time period between the extreme floods of 1965 and 1999, the reed areas expanded to nearly 85% of the area before 1965. The expansion rates increased with increasing distance to the flood event of 1965. Especially in periods with series of years of low spring water level the expansion rates were high. The damage degrees of the reed areas in the years 2000 and 2002 showed a clear relation to the elevation (i.e. average water level) of the stands. The damage degree increased with decreasing elevation. Furthermore the regeneration process of severely damaged stands was related to the elevation level of the stands. Whereas stands at high elevation regenerate fast, those at low elevation died off completely in the years after the extreme flood. This supports the hypothesis that the water level fluctuations play a major role in the reed dynamics of Lake Constance. As a consequence of climate change an increase in the frequency of high spring water levels is expected. Thus, it seems unlikely that reed stands will ever expand again to the same area as before 1965.																			0075-9511					MAY	2004	34	1-2					29	36		10.1016/S0075-9511(04)80019-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0075-9511(04)80019-7													WOS:000222030800005
J	Leeder, MR; Harris, T; Kirkby, MJ				Leeder, MR; Harris, T; Kirkby, MJ			Sediment supply and climate change: implications for basin stratigraphy	BASIN RESEARCH												The rate of sediment supply from erosional catchment to depositional basin depends primarily upon climate, relief, catchment slope and lithology. It varies in both time and space. Spatial changes in erosion rates due to variations in lithology are illustrated by contrasting rates of drainage divide migration away from faults of known ages. Time variations in relative sediment supply are extremely complex and vary widely according to the direction and magnitude of climate change. In many parts of the Great Basin and south-western USA, glacial maximum climates were characterized by higher effective moisture and the altitudinal downward spread of woods and forests. Sparse data from alluvial fans indicate reduced sediment supply, despite the increased runoff evident from higher lake levels. The situation in Mediterranean areas is less clear, with rival climatic scenarios for vegetation ecotypes predicting contrasting runoff. In order to test these latter we run Cumulative Seasonal Erosion Potential [CSEP] experiments for present-day and a variety of full-glacial Mediterranean candidate climates. The results indicate the likelihood of enhanced sediment supply and runoff compared to the present day during full-glacial times for a cool wet winter climate and a reduction in sediment supply and runoff for a full-glacial cool dry winter climate. We then explore the consequences of such phase differences in sediment supply, and sea and lake levels for the stratigraphy of sedimentary basins. Highstands and lowstands of sea or lake may be accompanied by greater or lesser sediment and water supply, as determined by the regional climate and the direction of climatic change. Thus marine lowstands are not necessarily periods of great transfer of coarse elastic sediments to shelves and deep water basinal environments. Unsteady sediment supply has greatest implications for alluvial systems, in particular the effect that changing relative supplies of water and sediment have upon river and fan channel incision.

J	McKnight, SK; Hepp, GR				McKnight, SK; Hepp, GR			Diet selectivity of gadwalls wintering in Alabama	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The nutritional quality of Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) as a food source for waterfowl has been questioned. We therefore studied dietary preferences of gadwalls (Anas strepera) at Guntersville Reservoir, Alabama, where milfoil is the dominant submerged aquatic plant and large numbers of gadwall occur in winter. Standing crop biomass of submersed aquatic vegetation in the reservoir declined 97% throughout minter (P < 0.05), and milfoil was the most important food (58-99% wet mass) of gadwalls in all months. Composition of foods consumed and available to gadwalls varied by month (P < 0.01), but not by sex or age (P > 0.05). Consumption of large milfoil stems (>2 mm wide) was less than that available (P < 0.01) in all months, and large milfoil stems generally ranked lower than other foods in order of preference. Food preference generally was not related to nutrient content of foods; however, ranks of food preference were positively correlated (r = 0.86, P < 0.02) with protein in January, when protein content of available foods was lowest (14%). Preference also was negatively correlated (r = -0.86, P < 0.02) with nitrogen-free extract (NFE) in January. Because protein and NFE were negatively correlated (r = -0.96, P < 0.01), avoidance of foods with high amounts of NFE in January may have resulted from selecting foods with high protein content. Despite changes in the nutrient content of available foods over time (P < 0.05), the nutrient composition of gadwall diets remained relatively constant (P > 0.05). Various parts of the milfoil plant differed nutritionally, and by selectively feeding on these parts and other foods, gadwalls were able to subsist on a diet dominated by milfoil.																			0022-541X	1937-2817				OCT	1998	62	4					1533	1543		10.2307/3802020	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3802020													WOS:000076722900040

Every year, these phenomena cause abundant and intensive rain fall which in turn provokes floods associated with the formation of destructive flows. This paper aims to deepen the knowledge of such processes and the prediction of their spatial distribution. The work was carried out in the Tzununa basin, taking as reference phenomena Hurricane Stan (2005) and Tropical Storm Agatha (2010). When they passed through the region, maximum rain falls of 383 and 269 mm were registered on two consecutive days. In this work, the geomorphological method was developed and flows were simulated with different rheological properties using FLO-2D software. The geomorphological detailed exploration field work has been essential and has allowed the validation of some of the model results. It has also enabled us to discard others wich are not representative of real conditions. The integration of the results of both methodologies has made possible the creation of a more detailed and validated inundation susceptibility map.

Characterization of L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter from floating and grounded thermokarst lake ice in Arctic Alaska	CRYOSPHERE												Radar remote sensing is a well-established method to discriminate lakes retaining liquid-phase water beneath winter ice cover from those that do not. L-band (23.6 cm wavelength) airborne radar showed great promise in the 1970s, but spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) studies have focused on C-band (5.6 cm) SAR to classify lake ice with no further attention to L-band SAR for this purpose. Here, we examined calibrated L-band single- and quadrature-polarized SAR returns from floating and grounded lake ice in two regions of Alaska: the northern Seward Peninsula (NSP) where methane ebullition is common in lakes and the Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP) where ebullition is relatively rare. We found average backscatter intensities of -13 dB and -16 dB for late winter floating ice on the NSP and ACP, respectively, and -19 dB for grounded ice in both regions. Polarimetric analysis revealed that the mechanism of L-band SAR backscatter from floating ice is primarily roughness at the ice-water interface. L-band SAR showed less contrast between floating and grounded lake ice than C-band; however, since L-band is sensitive to ebullition bubbles trapped by lake ice (bubbles increase backscatter), this study helps elucidate potential confounding factors of grounded ice in methane studies using SAR.					; Grosse, Guido/F-5018-2011	Engram, Melanie/0000-0002-1144-1827; Grosse, Guido/0000-0001-5895-2141													1994-0416	1994-0424					2013	7	6					1741	1752		10.5194/tc-7-1741-2013	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-7-1741-2013													WOS:000328546300006
J	LUECKE, C				LUECKE, C			PREDATION BY CUTTHROAT TROUT ON CHAOBORUS-FLAVICANS AS REVEALED BY A POPULATION BUDGET	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A population budget was constructed for Chaoborus flavicans in Lake Lenore, Washington, during the 1985 spring emergence to estimate the proportion of the population consumed by cutthroat trout. Weekly sampling of the population indicated that all individuals were competent to pupate and emerge and that cutthroat trout preyed heavily on the pupal stage. Field measurements of life-stage transformation rates and rates of fish predation were incorporated into a daily simulation model which indicated that cutthroat trout consumed 33% of all individuals during the spring emergence period. Length of the pupal period shortened as water temperature increased. This decrease in pupal period reduced the probability that individual pupae would be consumed by trout later in the emergence period. The simulation model was used to examine the effect of increased temperature on developmental processes. When lake temperatures were increased 2.degree. and 5.degree. C above measured values, a greater proportion of fourth instar larvae entering an emergence period survived to the adult stage. Consideration of developmental processes may help explain intra-annual variation in recruitment success of C. flavicans in Lake Lenore.

Utilizing sewage through innovative technology of generating electricity from falling wastewater in vertical stack pipes within skyscrapers presents a sustainable and efficient method to harness renewable energy. By installing turbines in these sewage systems, the kinetic energy of wastewater flow is converted into electrical power, offering significant cost savings and reducing reliance on grid electricity. The current renewable energy source aligns with sustainability objectives, diminishes carbon footprints of about 767,319 Tonnes of CO2 emissions per year, and improves sewage system efficiency by decreasing overflows and obstructions. An empirical analysis illustrates the practicality of the system, considering a daily water usage of 218,400 L, a wastewater density of 1006 kg/m3, and a maximum descent velocity of 29.1451 m/s. Utilizing a Permanent Magnet DC (PMDC) generator enables the production of 260 V DC, hence allowing the system to create a significant amount of electrical power to fulfill the energy requirements of a structure. The amount of electricity generated, which is equal to 220 kWh, substantially affects operating expenses and environmental advantages due to a total electrical power usage of 3 MWh. This research has taken into account the limitations and implications related to the practicality and dependability of the proposed system in real-world scenarios, with the development of a prototype design serving as an initial step. This technique signifies a noteworthy advancement in urban sustainability and energy efficiency, providing a pragmatic answer for contemporary towns to diminish their environmental footprint.

Climate-Glacier Dynamics and Topographic Forcing in the Karakoram Himalaya: Concepts, Issues and Research Directions	WATER												Understanding climate-glacier dynamics in High Mountain Asia is of critical importance to address issues including water resources, sea-level rise, mountain geodynamics, natural hazards and ecosystem sustainability. The Karakoram Himalaya is arguably the least understood region, given its extreme topography, climate-system coupling, and advancing and surge-type glaciers that exhibit complex flow patterns. Glacier fluctuations in the Karakoram Himalaya are highly variable in space and time because of numerous controlling factors, including the westerlies, the Indian summer monsoon, various teleconnections, topographic effects, glacier debris-cover characteristics, glacier dynamics, and geological conditions. The influence of the integrative coupling of forcing factors, however, has not been adequately assessed for characterizing the glaciers in the Karakoram Himalaya. Given the scarcity of in-situ data and the difficulty of conducting fieldwork on these glaciers, recent research has focused on utilizing remote sensing, geospatial technologies, and scientific modeling to obtain baseline information about the state of glaciers in the region. This review summarizes our current knowledge of glaciers, climate-glacier interaction, and topographic forcing in the Karakoram Himalaya, and demonstrates the complexities in mountain geodynamics that influence climate-glacier dynamics. Innovative analysis is also presented in support of our review and discussion.

De M.; Araujo-Jesus, Tatiane			Undesirable side-effects of water hyacinth control in a shallow tropical reservoir	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Based on a comprehensive data set collected monthly during 8 years (1997-2004), we evaluated the effects of mechanical removal of Eichhornia crassipes on the limnological characteristics and algal biomass of a polymictic shallow tropical reservoir. 2. Interrupted time series analyses indicated that the limnological responses to macrophyte removal can be classified as an 'abrupt permanent impact' implying that the overall mean of the time-series shifted promptly after intervention. These analyses indicated a significant increase for pH, total phosphorus, total phytoplankton and cyanobacterial biomass, and a decrease in water transparency and CO2 concentrations in the surface water; also, the increase in water stability, increase of bottom soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and decrease in bottom oxygen levels. 3. Cyclic anoxic periods previously observed during springs and summers were replaced by a persistent period of anoxic conditions in the sediment overlying water. Anoxic conditions were suitable for SRP release from sediments. Heavy cyanobacterial blooms became more persistent, maximum biomass (4229 mm(3) L-1) was 30 times larger, the blooms frequently reached 2 m and sometimes the bottom of the reservoir, contrasting to the preremoval period in which it reached at most 1 m deep. 4. The long-term P dynamics in the system, initially driven by allochthonous nutrient loadings were replaced by internal ecological processes. Water hyacinth removal markedly accelerated the process of eutrophication due to internal feedback mechanisms, leading to a switch to a more turbid state. Biological feedback mechanisms were driven by cyanobacterial blooms by enhancing water stability, oxygen anoxia at the bottom and by increasing suitable conditions for P internal loading. These data support the hypothesis of the role of cyanobacterial blooms as an important factor impairing water quality and driving the ecosystem towards a stable degraded state. 5. These findings have important implications for the restoration of shallow stratifying eutrophic lakes, as the alternative degraded state is most likely to occur when compared with their non-stratifying counterparts. Moreover, feedback mechanisms in tropical and subtropical shallow lakes seem to be stronger than in temperate ones, as stratification events are more likely to occur over the year, intensifying system resilience to restorative strategies.

The main objectives of this paper arc defining chemical features of water within six small arctic lakes located in Bellsund (Svalbard) in the area of continuous permafrost occurrence. The unique environmental conditions of the study area offer an opportunity to observe phenomena influencing water chemistry, such as: chemical weathering, permafrost thawing, marine aerosols, atmospheric deposition and biological inputs. In the water samples collected during the summer 2013, detailed tundra lake water chemistry characteristics regarding ions, trace elements, pH and specific electrolytic conductivity (SEC25) analysis were determined. Moreover, water chemistry of the studied lakes was compared to the water samples from the Tyvjobekken Creek and precipitation water samples. As a final step of data analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed. Detailed chemical analysis allowed us to conclude what follows: (1) Ca2+, Mg2+, SO4(2-), Sr are of geogenic origin, (2) NO3(-) present in tundra lakes and the Tyvjobekken Creek water samples (ranging from 0.31 to 1.69 mg L-1 and from 0.25 to 1.58 mg L-1 respectively) may be of mixed origin, i.e. from biological processes and permafrost thawing, (3) high contribution of non-sea-salt SO42- > 80% in majority of studied samples indicate considerable inflow of sulphate-rich air to the study area, (4) high content of chlorides in tundra lakes (range: 25.6-32.0% meq L-1) indicates marine aerosol influence, (5) PCA result shows that atmospheric transport may constitute a source of Mn, Co, Ni. Cu, Ga, Ba and Cd. However, further detailed inter-season and multi-seasonal study of tundra lakes in the Arctic are recommended. Especially in terms of detailed differentiation of sources influence (atmospheric transport vs. permafrost degradation). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	LING, H; DIAMOND, M; MACKAY, D				LING, H; DIAMOND, M; MACKAY, D			APPLICATION OF THE QWASI FUGACITY AQUIVALENCE MODEL TO ASSESSING SOURCES AND FATE OF CONTAMINANTS IN HAMILTON HARBOR	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A QWASI (Quantitative Water Air Sediment Interaction) fugacity/aquivalence mass balance model (Mackay et al. 1983, Mackay 1991, Mackay and Diamond 1989) has been developed for Hamilton Harbour to assess the sources and fate of contaminants in the system. Compartments defined during summer months are epilimnion, hypolimnion, and surficial sediment, and during other seasons a single water column and surficial sediment layer. Processes treated are chemical emissions, advective inflows, atmospheric deposition, diffusion between air and water, and sediment and water, sediment deposition, resuspension, and burial, transformation reactions in water and sediment, mass exchange between epilimnion and hypolimnion, and advective outflows. The model is used to describe the fate of four chemicals, total PCBs, benzo(a)pyrene, lead, and zinc. A complete picture of the steady-state behavior of these chemicals in the harbor is deduced, and the time responses of the system inferred. The relative importance of the various sources of contaminants, including sediment-water transfer, is demonstrated. It is shown that the major sources of contaminants are industrial emissions or wastewater treatment plants and, secondarily, the sediments. Water column stratification in summer results in minimal concentration differences in the epilimnion and hypolimnion because most of these chemicals are transferred within the water column in association with depositing particles. The short response times of the chemicals in the harbor (the water column and a 3 cm layer of active sediment) of less than 4 years suggest that current or recent inputs can account for most of the estimated chemical inventories. It is suggested that mass balance models such as this can play a useful role in remedial action planning.

Hydrographic development of the Aral Sea during the last 2000 years based on a quantitative analysis of dinoflagellate cysts	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The Aral Sea Basin is a critical area for studying the influence of climate and anthropogenic impact on the development of hydrographic conditions in an endorheic basin. We present organic-walled dinoflagellate cyst analyses with a sampling resolution of 15 to 20 years from a core retrieved at Chemyshov Bay in the NW Large Aral Sea (Kazakhstan). Cysts are present throughout, but species richness is low (seven taxa). The dominant morphotypes are Lingulodinium machaerophorum with varied process length and Impagidinium caspienense, a species recently described from the Caspian Sea. Subordinate species are Caspidinium rugosum, Romanodinium areolatum, Spiniferites cruciformis, cysts of Pentapharsodinium dalei, and round brownish protoperidiniacean cysts. The chlorococcalean algae Botryococcus and Pediastrum are taken to represent freshwater inflow into the Aral Sea. The data are used to reconstruct salinity as expressed in lake level changes during the past 2000 years. We quantify and date for the first time prominent salinity variations from the northern part of the Large Aral Sea. During high lake levels, I caspienense, representing brackish conditions with salinities of about 10-15 g kg(-1) or less, prevails. Assemblages dominated by L. machaerophorum document lake lowstands during approximately 0-425 AD (or 100? BC-425 AD), 920-1230 AD, 1500 AD, 1600-1650 AD, 1800 AD and since the 1960s. Because salinity in the Aral Sea is mostly controlled by meltwater discharges from the Syr Darya and Amu Darya rivers, we interpret changes in salinity levels as a proxy for temperature fluctuations in the Tien Shan Mountains that control snow melt. Significant erosion of marine Palaeogene and Neogene deposits in the hinterland, evidenced between 1230 AD and 1400 AD, is regarded as sheet-wash from shore. This is controlled by the low pressure system that develops over the Eastern Mediterranean and brings moist air to the Middle East and Central Asia during late spring and summer. We propose that the recorded environmental changes are related primarily to climate, but perhaps to a lesser extent by humancontrolled irrigation activities. Our results documenting climate change in western Central Asia are fairly consistent with reports elsewhere from Central Asia. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	James, WF; Barko, JW; Butler, MG				James, WF; Barko, JW; Butler, MG			Shear stress and sediment resuspension in relation to submersed macrophyte biomass	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We examined the impacts of macrophyte beds dominated by a canopy-forming (Myriophyllum sibiricum) and a meadow-forming (Chara canescens) species on bottom shear stress (tau) and resuspension in shallow Lake Christina, Minnesota (U.S.A.). Studies were conducted in late summer, 1998, when macrophyte biomass levels exceeded 200 g m(-2), and in early summer, 2000, when biomass was greatly reduced (<20 g m(-2)) in both plant beds. The critical shear stress (tau(c)) of sediments, measured experimentally in the laboratory, was low (1.4 dynes cm(-2)) indicating potential for resuspension in the absence of macrophytes. During 1998, turbidity was low at the M. sibiricum and Chara station, rarely increasing when calculated bottom tau(c) (calculated from wave theory assuming no biomass obstruction) exceeded tau(c), indicating that both beds reduced sediment resuspension at high biomass levels. In situ tau (estimated tau), measured via gypsum sphere dissolution, did not exceed to above the sediment interface in either bed during 1998. In contrast, sediment resuspension occurred in both beds during similar high winds in 2000. However, estimated tau was lower than calculated bottom tau, suggesting that at low biomass., macrophytes were having some impact on tau.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR 1	2004	515	1-3					181	191		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000027329.67391.c6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000027329.67391.c6													WOS:000220784500016

Sections of the core were dated with C-14 data obtained with high resolution mass spectrometry (AMS), and Holocene climate changes were inferred by categorizing predominant tree and fern vegetation identified from pollen and spore counts at various core depths. The temperature increased during 11.9-8.0 cal ka BP, and the warmest period was during 8.0-4.6 cal ka BP. Then, it gradually became cooler during the late Holocene. Our temperature estimates were in good agreement with the previous studies of the Holocene temperature in the Asian monsoon areas. There were two relatively wet periods of 10.7-8.0 cal ka BP and 4.6-2.6 cal ka BP. There was an asynchronous precipitation trend in the south, north and southwest China, which was probably due to the different monsoon impacts. In East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) area, the monsoon precipitation gradually transgressed northward during the early to middle Holocene and regressed southward during the late Holocene. Our results will be useful to improve the understanding of the coherent spatio-temporal patterns of climate evolution in EASM region in China.					; Bao, Kunshan/HGC-3930-2022; Song, Bing/AAA-9421-2020; Peng, Haijun/AAV-2687-2020	Peng, Haijun/0000-0002-2341-3882; Xiong, Kangning/0000-0001-5762-0866; Shen, Weidan/0000-0002-3408-0526; quan, mingying/0000-0003-3972-0841; Bao, Kunshan/0000-0002-7668-1522; Song, Bing/0000-0002-8493-6273													1040-6182	1873-4553				APR 20	2019	513						1	7		10.1016/j.quaint.2019.01.009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2019.01.009													WOS:000469328000001
J	Li, XZ; Yang, H; Yao, Y; Chen, YW; Liu, WG				Li, Xiangzhong; Yang, Hong; Yao, Yuan; Chen, Yuwei; Liu, Weiguo			Precipitation changes recorded in the sedimentary total organic carbon isotopes from Lake Poyang in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River, southern China over the last 1600 years	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Lake Poyang, the largest freshwater lake of China, is well known for its ecological and hydrological importance as a dynamic wetland and lake system. The climatic change and its effect on ecological and hydrological system of the lake has aroused considerable interest in recent years. So, a sediment core from Lake Poyang was analyzed for delta C-13 total organic matter (delta(13)Corg) to study the hydrological changes in the Lake Poyang catchment. By comparing with modern meteorological data (precipitation and temperature) and hydrological data (volume of runoff), the result showed that the delta(13)Corg values in the sediment are negatively correlated with the total runoff of the 5 main rivers supplying water to Lake Poyang and precipitation in this area over the past 50 years. Therefore, the delta(13)Corg values of the Lake Poyang sediment can serve as reliable proxies for reconstruction of river discharge and regional precipitation, with negative delta(13)Corg values representing increased precipitation in the Lake Poyang area. On this basis, the river discharge and regional precipitation variation in the Lake Poyang catchment over the past 1600 years were discussed. The delta(13)Corg values suggest that the precipitation was highest in the period 340-880 AD, and then decreased with fluctuations to the minimum at approximately 1110 AD. During the period of Medieval Warm Period (1110-1350 AD, MWP), the precipitation was generally in the high level except low amount during period of 1140 AD to 1220AD. The precipitation was in low amount during the Little Ice Age (1350-1620 AD, LIA), except for a sudden increase at approximately 1550-1560 AD. The precipitation continuously increased with little fluctuation from 1610 AD until now. In general, changes in regional precipitation and river discharge were dominated by variations in the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM) precipitation in the Lake Poyang area, consistent with other records from the ASM-controlled areas of China.

WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The decomposition of wetland plant litter is pivotal in the functioning of wetland ecosystems in terms of organic matter mineralization progress and nutrient cycling. Aiming to investigate the effects of the droppings of wintering herbivorous waterbirds on the decomposition of Carex cinerascens Kukenth litter a newly designated Ramsar Site, decomposition patterns of three types of samples were characterized and compared by waterbird dropping addition and litterbag in situ experiment. The three types of samples are OCL (only C. cinerascens litter), OWD (only waterbird droppings) and CMD (C. cinerascens litter mixed with waterbird droppings), respectively. A total of 105 decomposition bags were placed and the experiment lasted 150 days. The results showed that the average decay rate of C. cinerascens cellulose increased by approximately 32.12% by the addition of bird droppings, while the C. cinerascens lignin decay rate increased by approximately 83.05%. And the release of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous of C. cinerascens increased by approximately 18.3%, 61.09%, and 66.71%, respectively. We concluded that the addition of waterbird droppings significantly accelerated the decomposition of C. cinerascens litter and the release of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. We have a preliminary deduction that waterbird droppings (1) altered the original stoichiometric ratio of the litter, (2) increased the available nutrient content, (3) increased the colonization ability of the microorganisms, and (4) stimulated the production of a series of extracellular degradation enzymes. This study provides a thinking that the important role of waterbirds should be given full attention in wetland restoration planning and management.					; Zhang, Quanjun/NYT-3493-2025; Yu, Xiubo/A-5875-2016	Zhang, Quanjun/0000-0001-6087-3928; 													0923-4861	1572-9834				AUG	2021	29	4					581	597		10.1007/s11273-021-09804-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-021-09804-w		MAY 2021											WOS:000648195100001

Results showed that the quantity of the AOB decreased in the Typha latifolia CW with the increase of vertical depth, except in the root area where obvious rising was observed, and it was 2-4 times the quantity of the control. Additionally, ORP in the rhizosphere was found to be higher than other areas, which showed that Typha latifolia CW was in an aerobic state in summer when using simulated non-point sewage in rural area of Lake Taihu in China and small town combined sewage.																					7-112-07386-3				2005							945	951																WOS:000233621400114
J	STCYR, L; CAMPBELL, PGC; GUERTIN, K				STCYR, L; CAMPBELL, PGC; GUERTIN, K			EVALUATION OF THE ROLE OF SUBMERGED PLANT BEDS IN THE METAL BUDGET OF A FLUVIAL LAKE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In a study of a large fluvial lake (Lake St. Pierre, St. Lawrence River system, Quebec), we have determined the biomass of the submerged vegetation (dominated by Vallisneria americana and Potamogeton spp) during the peak seasonal biomass (August) and senescence (October), and have estimated the content of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn in the above-ground portions of these plants. Multispectral remote sensing data (MEIS-II) were used to extrapolate from point measures of biomass (g m(-2)) to the entire area of the lake (Lavoie et al., 1991). By combining field information (biomass values and metal concentrations) with the more extensive remote sensing data base of biomass values, and by using geostatistical estimation techniques (kriging), we have estimated the seasonal storage of metals in Lake St. Pierre plants to be: 30 kg Cd, 89 kg Cr, 450 kg Cu, 280 kg Ni, 71 kg Pb and 2200 kg Zn. During the seasonal biomass peak, the quantities of Cd, Pb and Zn stored in the plants were higher than those dissolved in the water column, but much lower than those present in the surficial, recent sediments. Mass balance calculations for the summer months indicated that the 'macrophyte' compartment represented only a small proportion of the metals entering the lake: Cu and Ni, <1%; Cd and Zn, 2%; Pb, 4%. Senescence and the downstream drifting of plant material noted in October suggested that most of the metals associated with the above-ground parts of the submerged vegetation were not recycled within the lake, but instead were exported at the end of the summer.

Field measurements of Secchi disk depths in the summer months by volunteer samplers in several hundred lakes showed a small, statistically significant increase in water transparency during the period 1976 through 2013. A reanalysis of satellite-inferred Secchi depths between 1990 and 2010 showed no trend over time. In addition, diatom-inferred Secchi depths from short sediment cores in a randomly selected group of Maine lakes analyzed by the US Environmental Protection Agency showed no statistically significant difference between the average Secchi depths in a pre-1850 time period and the early 1990s. Lake maximum depth was the most important morphological variable associated with water clarity among Maine lakes. In individual lakes, both water color and chlorophyll were inversely correlated with Secchi disk depths. The statewide annual average Secchi depths for the summer months were inversely correlated with water color and the amount of precipitation for the months of January through June. Drought years led to increased Secchi depths.																			2044-2041	2044-205X					2016	6	1					11	27		10.5268/IW-6.1.864	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-6.1.864													WOS:000371809400002

Epiphytic invertebrate communities may be altered through the replacement of native macrophytes by exotic macrophytes, even when the macrophytes are close relatives and have similar morphology. We sampled an invasive exotic macrophyte, Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum), and native milfoils Myriophyllum sibericum and Myriophyllum alterniflorum in four bodies of water in southern Quebec and upstate New York during the summer of 2005. Within each waterbody, we compared the abundance, diversity, and community composition of epiphytic macroinvertebrates on exotic and native Myriophyllum. In general, both M. sibericum and M. alterniflorum had higher invertebrate diversity and higher invertebrate biomass and supported more gastropods than the exotic M. spicatum. In late summer, invertebrate density tended to be higher on M. sibericum than on M. spicatum, but lower on M. alterniflorum than on M. spicatum. Our results demonstrate that M. spicatum supports macroinvertebrate communities that may differ from those on structurally similar native macrophytes, although these differences vary across sites and sampling dates. Thus, the replacement of native milfoils by M. spicatum may have indirect effects on aquatic food webs.

Implications of hypoxia on the North Branch of the Kawkawlin River	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The North Branch of the Kawkawlin River, a Saginaw Bay tributary, is frequently in a state of non-attainment of the Michigan standard for dissolved oxygen (5 mg/L), as documented in a Total Maximum Daily Load issued by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality in 2007. Analysis of a reach of the North Branch of the Kawkawlin River during the summers of 2011 and 2012 revealed conditions that can adversely affect fish habitat and water quality. Dissolved oxygen levels were found to be below 2 mg/L during summer months, which is too low to sustain warm water fish species. Furthermore, benthic invertebrates were nearly nonexistent in the hypoxic reach of the river. On average, water samples from the river channel near a riparian wetland in the hypoxic reach exhibited unusually low pH (similar to 7), low D.O. (<1 mg/L), elevated phosphorus, and reduced turbidity compared to upstream samples. The hypoxia and low pH in the riparian wetland were consistent with conditions able to reduce sedimentary iron thereby mobilizing bound reactive phosphorus (phosphate-P).

An initial early peak in the mean size of migrating smolts occurred several weeks before the peak in their timing, and in several years when smolt migration was monitored until July, a late peak in size occurred near the end of the smolt migration. Changes in the mean size of smolts were not related to their origin within the watershed, and varying age compositions were only partially responsible for the two peaks in mean size. Fish overwintering in tributary lakes grew faster than fish overwintering in tributary streams. A greater proportion of lake-origin smolts migrated to sea after only 1 yr in freshwater than stream-origin smolts. It appears that fish that wait until their second spring to smoltify are among the first to emigrate that spring. These relatively large 2+ smolts, combined with fast growing 1+ smolts that leave early during their first spring, cause the first peak in size. The small numbers of large smolts leaving the Keogh River at the ends of several of the smolt runs apparently left then because of minor flow increases in the river. As has been found with releases of coho smolts from nearby hatcheries, fish that left the Keogh River early in the smolt run generally had a more northerly marine catch distribution than later migrating smolts. A greater proportion of fish migrating to sea late in the smolt run were caught in the fishery than fish migrating early. Additional work examining the marine survival of early and late migrating wild smolts is recommended to enable detailed comparisons to be made between the optimal timing and size of wild and hatchery smolts.

The presence of phototrophic bacteria was reported for the first time in some lakes. Different types of phototrophic microorganisms were separated in three different clusters, by decreasing values of photosynthetic available radiation (PAR) and redox potential (Eh): (1) cyanobacteria and eukaryotic phytoplankton, (2) Chromatiaceae and multicellular filamentous green bacteria, (3) green sulfur bacteria. Each cluster conformed one different layer of the vertical distribution of the community. At each layer, usually one type of microorganisms outcompeted the others, but at times they were found together in competition. The three layers were mixed at the bottom of the lake at the beginning of the stratification period, before widening and colonising the water column. At the end of summer, the contraction of the metalimnion resulted in overlapping or suppressing some layers. (C) 1998 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

J	Naslund, I; Henricson, J				Naslund, I; Henricson, J			Growth of five landlocked Arctic charr stocks under hatchery conditions	AQUACULTURE INTERNATIONAL												Growth dynamics of five stocks of Arctic charr, were compared from the fry stage in June 1986 until December 1987. Each stock originated from a different lake in Sweden: Hornavan; Nackten; Torron; Rensjon and Visjon. Hornavan charr reached the highest final mean weight (237 g), but they were not significantly heavier than Visjon charr (206 g). Growth of fish of the three remaining stocks was similar but less rapid. The superior growth performance of Hornavan charr was most pronounced during autumn. Coefficients of variation for individual size within stocks was between 30 and 54%, with Hornavan and Nackten charr displaying least variability. Charr from Lake Visjon had a significantly lower proportion of mature males (6%) than the other stocks (19-29%) at the end of the experiment. The results demonstrate that differences in growth potential exist between stocks of charr, and these differences may be related to differential seasonal rhythms in growth. Variations in early growth, size distributions and sexual maturation seemed to be subordinate factors affecting overall growth performance.																			0967-6120					JUN	1996	4	2					105	116		10.1007/BF00140592	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00140592													WOS:A1996VU01800002

Its status is largely a consequence of its abundance in North America where, unique among North American grebes, it is able to exploit the superabundant food resources of hypersaline lakes in the Great Basin. This results in high survivorship of juveniles during the critical first months of independence and of adults through the extended autumn staging period, and ultimately to increased population size. Because the major hypersaline lakes in North America are of post-Pleistocene origin, the Eared Grebe's current preeminence has likely been achieved only in the past several thousand years.																			1524-4695	1938-5390				AUG	2001	24	2					245	249		10.2307/1522037	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1522037													WOS:000170229400014

Antigenic diversity and cross-reactivity of avian influenza H5N1 viruses in Egypt between 2006 and 2011	JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY												Influenza epidemics are a major health concern worldwide. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses in Egypt have been subject to rapid genetic and antigenic changes since the first outbreak in February 2006 and have been endemic in poultry in Egypt since 2008. In this study, 33 H5N1 viruses isolated from avian hosts were antigenically analysed by using a panel of eight mAbs raised against the A/Viet Nam/1203/04 (H5N1; clade 1) and A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai-lake/1A/05 (H5N1; clade 2.2) influenza viruses. Rats were immunized with inactivated whole-virus vaccine produced by reverse genetics with the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of eight antigenically different HPAI H5N1 virus isolates and six internal genes from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) to produce polyclonal antibodies. Cross-reactivity between the obtained polyclonal antibodies and the isolated viruses was assayed. Antigenic cartography of the isolated viruses showed that three antigenic clusters were defined based on haemagglutination inhibition (HI) analysis using mAbs and the majority of viruses isolated in 2010 and 2011 fell into two of these clusters. An antigenic map based on polyclonal rat antisera showed that all virus isolates fell within one extended cluster. Accordingly, continuous surveillance and antigenic characterization will help us determine which virus isolate(s) should be used in poultry vaccine preparation.

J	Robinson, SR; Beckstead, J				Robinson, Scott R.; Beckstead, Julie			Trends in Numbers of Winter Bald Eagles at Lake Coeur d'Alene in Idaho	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												During their winter migration, bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) stop at Lake Coeur d'Alene, Idaho to eat spawned kokanee salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Long-term data on these migrating bald eagles provide a unique opportunity to investigate their trend from 1974 to 2010. We counted bald eagles during 12 weeks from November through February of each year. They arrived in mid-November, peaked in number in late-December, and departed in January. We recorded the fewest bald eagles, latest arrival dates, and slowest rates of arrival (i.e., linear slope between peak numbers of bald eagles with dates of their first and peak occurrences) during the 1980s. Numbers of bald eagles rebounded during the 2000s, with the most bald eagles, earliest arrival dates, and fastest rate of arrival. To explore trends at a regional scale, we utilized data from the Midwinter Bald Eagle Surveys along with available salmon data. We found that Lake Coeur d'Alene had an average 34% more midwinter numbers of bald eagles and an average 74% less biomass of kokanee salmon during the 2000s than the 1980s. Neighboring Lake Pend Oreille had an average 48% fewer midwinter numbers of bald eagles and an average 58% less biomass of kokanee salmon during the same time period. These results indicate that active management of kokanee salmon may increase bald eagles at Lake Pend Oreille but not necessarily at Lake Coeur d'Alene. Numbers of bald eagles at Lake Coeur d'Alene have been largely influenced by a combination of growing nesting populations and shifting migration patterns.

(1963) for marine phytoplankton. However, we found out that in nearly all lakes studied C:P ratios deviate systemtically from this value especially during periods, when phosphorus is growth limiting. Thus, during summer the sestonic C:P ratio generally exceeds 106 in the epilimnion, but decreases with depth in the hypolimnion. Possible mechanisms which may lead to these seasonal and spatial changes in the C:P ratio are discussed.

J	BERGER, C				BERGER, C			INSITU PRIMARY PRODUCTION, BIOMASS AND LIGHT REGIME IN THE WOLDERWIJD, THE MOST STABLE OSCILLATORIA-AGARDHII LAKE IN THE NETHERLANDS	HYDROBIOLOGIA												During the entire period of research from 1971 to 1982 Oscillatoria agardhii Gomont was overwhelmingly present in the Wolderwijd. Six years of measurements of primary production has pointed out that the gross production per day firstly is related to temperature and secondly to irradiation. However, the production per year is neither related to temperature not to irradiation. In a cold summer gross production is as high as in a warm summer due to higher production in the lower part of the euphotic zone. In the discussion attention is focused on production characteristics and light climate in relation to the morphometry of the lake. Up to an average depth of 2.5 m blooming of O. agardhii occurs easily, whilst light saturated production achieves its maximum between 2.0 and 2.5 m depth. Increasing depth leads to photo-inhibition in the upper layers followed by lowering of light saturated production. Only special circumstances such as days with microstratification allow growth, resulting then in a monoculture of the alga.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 29	1989	185	3					233	244		10.1007/BF00036611	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00036611													WOS:A1989CK35300007
J	Heinrich, K; Leslie, DJ; Morlock, M; Bertilsson, S; Jonas, K				Heinrich, Kristina; Leslie, David J.; Morlock, Michaela; Bertilsson, Stefan; Jonas, Kristina			Molecular Basis and Ecological Relevance of Caulobacter Cell Filamentation in Freshwater Habitats	MBIO												All living cells are characterized by certain cell shapes and sizes. Many bacteria can change these properties depending on the growth conditions. The underlying mechanisms and the ecological relevance of changing cell shape and size remain unclear in most cases. One bacterium that undergoes extensive shape-shifting in response to changing growth conditions is the freshwater bacterium Caulobacter crescentus. When incubated for an extended time in stationary phase, a subpopulation of C. crescentus forms viable filamentous cells with a helical shape. Here, we demonstrated that this stationary-phase-induced filamentation results from downregulation of most critical cell cycle regulators and a consequent block of DNA replication and cell division while cell growth and metabolism continue. Our data indicate that this response is triggered by a combination of three stresses caused by prolonged growth in complex medium, namely, the depletion of phosphate, alkaline pH, and an excess of ammonium. We found that these conditions are experienced in the summer months during algal blooms near the surface in freshwater lakes, a natural habitat of C. crescentus, suggesting that filamentous growth is a common response of C. crescentus to its environment. Finally, we demonstrate that when grown in a biofilm, the filamentous cells can reach beyond the surface of the biofilm and potentially access nutrients or release progeny. Altogether, our work highlights the ability of bacteria to alter their morphology and suggests how this behavior might enable adaptation to changing environments. IMPORTANCE Many bacteria drastically change their cell size and morphology in response to changing environmental conditions. Here, we demonstrate that the freshwater bacterium Caulobacter crescentus and related species transform into filamentous cells in response to conditions that commonly occur in their natural habitat as a result of algal blooms during the warm summer months. These filamentous cells may be better able to scavenge nutrients when they grow in biofilms and to escape from protist predation during planktonic growth. Our findings suggest that seasonal changes and variations in the microbial composition of the natural habitat can have profound impact on the cell biology of individual organisms. Furthermore, our work highlights that bacteria exist in morphological and physiological states in nature that can strongly differ from those commonly studied in the laboratory.					; Bloch, Michael/O-7845-2017; Jonas, Kristina/K-4513-2015	Bertilsson, Stefan/0000-0002-4265-1835; Heinrich, Kristina/0000-0001-9150-3217; Jonas, Kristina/0000-0002-1469-4424													2150-7511					JUL-AUG	2019	10	4							e01557-19	10.1128/mBio.01557-19	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mBio.01557-19								31431551					WOS:000493912200004
J	Yang, Y; Yin, XA; Chen, H; Yang, ZF				Yang, Ying; Yin, Xin'an; Chen, He; Yang, Zhifeng			Determining water level management strategies for lake protection at the ecosystem level	HYDROBIOLOGIA												To prevent lake degradation, water level management has been a major focus of research in the past several decades. There are, however, some shortcomings in the traditional studies, and the protection of entire ecosystems is difficult to achieve in practice. In this paper, the framework of a new method for determining ecosystem-based water level regimes (WLRs) for lake protection is proposed. First, historical WLRs are divided into several sub-stages. Then, ecosystem statuses corresponding to different WLRs are quantified and compared. Finally, parameters of optimal and acceptable WLRs are used to determine water level management goals. The proposed method was applied to Baiyangdian Lake, the largest shallow lake in the North China Plain, to test its effectiveness. Results showed that to protect the ecosystem at the optimal status, 50% of the parameter values should fall within the range of the 25th and 75th percentiles of Stage I; and to protect the ecosystem from reverse succession, 50% of the water level parameter values should fall within the range of the 25th and 75th percentiles of Stage II. This method takes ecosystem status into account, and has high practicability in water resources management.

J	Girjatowicz, JP; Swiatek, M; Kowalewska-Kalkowska, H				Girjatowicz, Jozef Piotr; Swiatek, Malgorzata; Kowalewska-Kalkowska, Halina			Relationships between air temperature and ice conditions on the southern Baltic coastal lakes in the context of climate change	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Shallow, lagoonal coastal lakes of the Southern Baltic are exceptionally susceptible to atmospheric factors. This work examines the influence of winter air temperatures on ice parameters (dates of first ice occurrence and last ice disappearance, ice season duration, number of days with ice, and annual maximum ice thickness) on Southern Baltic coastal lakes (Jamno, Bukowo, Gardno, Lebsko), and trends displayed by changes in these parameters over the period spanning 1960/61-2019/20. The research data was retrieved from the archives of Institute of Meteorology and Water Management - National Research Institute. As a first step of the analysis, we investigated the statistical relationships in spatial and temporal variations in winter air temperature and coastal lake ice parameters. Correlation and regression method was employed to determine the influence of air temperature on coastal lake ice conditions. Correlation coefficients were calculated, and linear regression equations were determined. The statistical significance of the observed relationships was assessed using Fisher-Snedecor test. Additionally, linear trend models were constructed. Our analysis indicates that from 1960/61 to 2019/20, the average rate of increase in winter temperature (December-March) equalled 0.04 degrees C-year-1. The correlation coefficients for air temperature versus ice parameters were highly statistically significant (alpha<0.001). The strongest relationships (with correlation coefficients below-0.90) occurred between air temperature and number of days with ice. Ice season duration and number of days with ice are both closely linked with last ice disappearance date and ice thickness. Our analysis shows that a 1 degrees C increase in average seasonal air temperature will result in the number of days with ice on the studied coastal lakes becoming reduced by 16-17 days. All trends in ice parameters indicate a mildening of ice conditions. The assessed trends are statistically significant, except for L (date of last ice disappearance) for Lake Jamno and H (annual maximum ice thickness) on lakes Jamno and Bukowo, at least at alpha=0.05 level. Their correlation coefficients are usually in the range from-0.35 to-0.50. The strongest trends were observed for ice season duration. Ice season duration shortens in an eastward direction by 0.66 day center dot year-1 (Lake Jamno) to 1.16 day center dot year-1 (Lake Lebsko). All correlation coefficients for ice trends were found to increase eastward, which could be explained by an increasing influence of the warming climate over the Southern Baltic in this direction. The strong relationships between air temperature and Southern Baltic coastal lake ice parameters, and the determined rate of changes may have a significance for forecasting, as the shifting dates of ice formation and disappearance on lakes are highly important for the lake hydrodynamics, and the functioning of aquatic ecosystems.

Upon examination of the stomach contents from 116 walleye, we found 43 had food in their stomachs. Of these, pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) represented 34% by weight and 48% by number of the total contents, while yellow perch represented only 29% by weight and 11% by number. After a survey of available forage in the pond, we determined that the walleye were targeting pumpkinseed sunfish over yellow perch both in the fall of 1993 (P < 0.001) and the fall of 1994 (P < 0.025). Our results contrast with that of others suggesting that walleye do not feed heavily on centrarchids. The vulnerability of different centrachids to walleye predation can vary by species but our study suggests that walleye could be introduced to shallow waters to control some species of overabundant centrarchids, particularly pumpkinseed sunfish.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				MAR	1998	13	1					9	14		10.1080/02705060.1998.9663585	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1998.9663585													WOS:000072309100002
J	Oka, N; Hamasoto, H				Oka, N; Hamasoto, H			Nutritional condition and muscular features of wintering Long-billed Murrelets in Japan	CONDOR												We analyzed the nutritional condition and morphological characteristics of wintering Long-billed Murrelets (Brachyramphas perdix) in Japan. These birds were well nourished with an average body mass of 293 g, composed of a mean total body fat of 40.7 g (14%). The fat deposit was equivalent to an average energy reserve of 2.5 days at the estimated energy consumption of 615 kJ day(-1) or 2.1 kJ g(-1) day(-1). Muscle mass consisted mainly of water (73%) and fat-free dry matter (26%), with small amounts of fat. Uropygial glands consisted of 33% fat and 17% fat-free dry matter, with 48% water. Long-billed Murrelets were characterized by large pectoral (26% of fat-free body mass) and small leg muscles (2% of fat-free body mass). We believe that these muscular traits, which contrast with those of alcids breeding at coastal colonies, reflect specific adaptations to inland nesting and long-distance foraging.																				1938-5129				NOV	2001	103	4					874	878		10.1650/0010-5422(2001)103[0874:NCAMFO]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1650/0010-5422(2001)103[0874:NCAMFO]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000172135400025
J	Mihaljevic, M; Novoselic, D				Mihaljevic, M; Novoselic, D			Trophic state of Lake Sakadas (Mature Reserve Kopacki rit, Croatia) in the late autumnal and winter period of 1997/98	PERIODICUM BIOLOGORUM												Background and purpose: Lake Sakadas, the deepest lake in the complex wetland ecosystem of the Kopacki rit Nature Reserve, was under the influence of untreated waste waters during the 1980s. The improvement of water quality and decrease in entrophication were registered in the period from ifs revitalization (controling of waste waters and sediment removal) till the beginning of the war activities (1991). The aim of this paper is to establish the trophic state of Lake Sakadas according to the first post-war hydrobiological research done in the late autumnal and winter period of 1997/98. Material and methods: Sampling was done at monthly intervals from November 1991 till March 1998 (except in Fabruary) at one site in the central part of the lake. Physical and chemical characteristics of the surface and contact zone sediment-wafer were determined according to standard methods, Qualitative and quantitative analyses of phytoplankton and zooplankton, as well as chlorophyll-a analysis were done at three water depths. The Shannon-Weawer diversity and ANOVA were used for the statistical analysis of results. Results: Oxygen depletion in November caused mass fish mortality for a short time but with significant consequences on the lake ecosystem. High concentration of ammonium and nitrate, as well as organic matter and low Secchi transparency were recorded during the entire period. In the extremely abundant phytoplankton community Euglenophyceae were constantly well developed. Mass development of Synura was observed in December and January while in March the predominance was gained by centric diatoms. The absolute dominance of rotifers, namely microfilter feeder populations, was the main characteristic of the zooplankton community: Conclusions: With respect to all data, high eutrophic to hypertrophic condition of Lake Sakadas in the late autumnal and winter period of 1997/98 was proved. In comparison with investigation results obtained before the war the increase in the level of eutrophication is evident.																			0031-5362					OCT	2000	102	3					253	257																WOS:000165990600004

Total biomass was positively and significantly related to sediment potassium content and to sediment texture. 3. Sediment nitrogen and potassium levels are correlated in the spring but not at the end of the growing season. 4.

Nearshore ice-complex morphodynamics within an urban embayment, Southwestern Lake Michigan: Insights from a winter 2021-2022 monitoring study	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Process-based insights into ice-shoreline morphodynamics are generally lacking, yet are critical for modeling and managing cold climate coastlines. In this study, conducted during the winter of 2021-2022 at an engineered Lake Michigan pocket beach, we address this knowledge gap by integrating repeat footage from beach cameras, aerial photographs acquired during sub-weekly drone flights, weather station information, and precision pre- and post-ice topo-bathymetric survey data to document and categorize the geomorphic evolution of a nearshore-ice complex under varying meteorologic and hydrodynamic conditions. While ice-complex formation and collapse were largely temperature-driven, episodes of sudden expansion followed multi-day wave events, with nearshore wave heights >1.5 m. These conditions promoted the accumulation and integration of brash ice and slush ice, brought in from elsewhere, along the ice front. Rapid nearshore ice-complex (re)expansion, following active erosion of the ice front during the high-energy wave events, was promoted by the calmer marine states to follow, during subzero temperature conditions. The cumulative impacts of shore ice on the lake bottom were captured in pre- and post-ice survey datasets. Up to similar to 0.5 m of elevation loss occurred across the nearshore zone of ice advance and retreat, given wave scour along the ice front. Sand losses were roughly balanced by accretion of the lakeward part of the urban embayment. This study offers valuable insights into cross-shore dynamics obscured along more open sections of coast by complex littoral dynamics. Better understanding of ice-shoreline morphodynamics has implications for coastal resiliency planning for anticipated climate change.																			0380-1330					AUG	2025	51	4							102503	10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102503	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102503													WOS:001540922200026

Here we present the first alkenone-based paleotemperature reconstructions for the past 21 kyr from Lake Balikun, central Asia. We show, unlike the initiation of Holocene warm conditions at similar to 11 kyr BP in the monsoon regions, the arid central Asia remained in a glacial-like cold condition prior to 8 kyr BP and experienced abrupt warming of similar to 9 degrees C after the collapse of the Laurentide ice sheet. Comparison with pollen and other geochemical data indicates the abrupt warming is closely associated with major increase in the moisture supply to the region. Together, our multiproxy data indicate-2 thousand years delay of temperature and moisture optimum relative to local summer insolation maximum, suggesting major influence of the Laurentide ice sheet and other high latitude ice sheet forcings on the regional atmospheric circulation. In addition, our data reveal a temperature drop by similar to 4 degrees C around 4 kyr BP lasting multiple centuries, coinciding with severe increases in aridity previously reported based on multiproxy data. In contrast, model simulations display a much less pronounced delay in the initiation of Holocene warm conditions, raising unresolved questions about the relative importance of local radiative forcing and high -latitude ice on temperature in this region.

They provide multiple functions, including irrigation, transportation, food supply, recreation, and water supply. Therefore, evaluations of water quality and pollution sources are of great significance for ecological restoration and management of rivers. In this study, the improved "vusekriterijumska optimizacija i kompromisno rjesenje" (VIKOR in Serbian; in English: Multicriteria Optimization and Compromise Solution), and a geodetector were used to analyze the water quality characteristics and pollution sources of the Maotiao River Basin (Gizhou province, SW China). The results showed that the water quality of the Maotiao River Basin deteriorated significantly during the summer drought period, as was evident in the reservoirs and lakes. It improved in the wet season (i.e., during the summer period) due to runoff dilution. Water quality decreased along the river's course, from upstream to downstream sections. The results of the geographic detector analysis showed that agricultural areas were the primary factor affecting the spatial distribution of water quality in the river basin. In July, August, and November 2020, the influence of agricultural land was 0.72, 0.60, or 0.80, respectively, and the interactions among urban, industrial, agricultural, and forested areas explained 99.2%, 83.2%, or 99.9% of the spatial differentiation of water quality, respectively. Due to the influence of spatial scale, settlements have a small influence on the spatial distribution of water quality. Their impact factors were 0.38, -0.24, and -0.05, respectively. Notably, the negative relationship of water quality and forested areas reflects that topography, types of landscapes, and soil thickness have considerable influences on the Maotiao River Basin's water quality. Based on the findings, we infer that good farmland water conservancy projects and comprehensive management of different types of landscapes, such as forests, agriculture, and urban area and water bodies, are of great significance for improving water quality.					; jiao, shulin/E-4234-2012; Huang, Guojia/T-1867-2018; Li, Haoyu/ACR-0968-2022	Brancelj, Anton/0000-0002-8767-3894; 														2073-4441				FEB	2022	14	3							301	10.3390/w14030301	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14030301													WOS:000757219800001
J	Johnson, DL; Lynch, WE; Morrison, TW				Johnson, DL; Lynch, WE; Morrison, TW			Fish communities in a diked Lake Erie wetland and an adjacent undiked area	WETLANDS												Most (84%) of Ohio's remaining Lake Erie wetlands are diked to maximize food production and habitat for migrating waterfowl. Typically these wetlands are partially drained during spring and refilled the following fall. Fish populations have not been managed extensively, probably because few quantitative data are available on fish communities in diked wetlands and on how water-level manipulations affect these communities. We used trap nets to sample fish monthly (April-August) in diked West Marsh and in the formerly diked Muddy Creek Bay. We compared fish communities on the basis of species richness, composition, and equitability; relative abundance; and mean length and body condition of species common to both areas. We collected 23 species from the diked area and 40 species from the undiked area. Although there were more species collected in the undiked area, species equitability was greater in the diked wetland. The five most abundant species in the diked wetland were white crappie Pomoxis annularis, brown bullhead Amieurus nebulosus, black bullhead A. melas, goldfish Carassius auratus, and common carp Cyprinis carpio. The dominant species in the undiked area were white perch Morone americana, gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum, white crappie, brown bullhead, and yellow perch Perca flavescens. Neither area contained a classical, diverse wetland fish community. Mean lengths of white crappie, common carp, goldfish, and brown bullhead were significantly greater from the undiked area during all months. Body condition indices of > 150 mm white crappies and > 225 mm brown bullheads were significantly greater in the undiked area after June. The large differences in length and condition indices indicate that fish communities in the diked wetland may be biologically isolated from those in the adjacent undiked area. This has management implications given that an almost complete exchange of water occurs annually and could result in extensive movement of fish in and out of the diked wetland. Management strategies compatible with or enhancing existing wildlife management strategies need to be developed for improving fish communities in diked wetlands and enhancing their contribution to Lake Erie.																			0277-5212					MAR	1997	17	1					43	54		10.1007/BF03160717	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03160717													WOS:A1997WQ46800005

The role of N2 fixation in alleviating N limitation in wetland metaphyton:: enzymatic, isotopic, and elemental evidence	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												The role of nitrogen (N-2) fixation in balancing N supply to wetland metaphyton was assessed by comparing primary production with enzymatic, isotopic, and elemental correlates. Primary production, N-2 fixation (acetylene reduction, AR), phosphatase activity, C:N:P ratio, and N isotopic composition of metaphyton were measured along a nutrient gradient in a freshwater marsh during May through September 2004. N-2 fixation and phosphatase activity in metaphyton were negatively correlated with inorganic N and P concentrations, respectively. Although metaphyton N-2 fixation demonstrated a clear spatial pattern along the nutrient gradient, N-2 fixation rates varied monthly and decreased sharply in September. However, the percent contribution of N-2 fixation to N uptake by metaphyton consistently decreased throughout the summer. Furthermore, the decreased contribution of N-2 fixation to N uptake corresponded with an increase in metaphyton N content during the growing season. Nitrogen isotopic data suggested the sustained importance of an atmospheric N-2 source through September at the most downstream (nutrient poor) site even though the percent contribution of N-2 fixition to N uptake was lowest in that month. This suggests that metaphyton were efficiently accumulating and recycling fixed N-2 in support of primary production. Over the course of the summer, metaphyton primary production showed a weak inverse correlation with metaphyton phosphatase activity (r(2) = 0.58). The largest residuals in this regression corresponded to the largest vartiation in metaphyton N content. When metaphyton primary production was normalized to metaphyton N content, production rates for the entire growing season were more strongly inversely correlated with metaphyton phosphatase activity (r(2) = 0.78). Results of the study suggest that N-2 fixation in N poor areas may adequately supplement community N requirements in metaphyton, thereby causing limitation by other elemental resources such as P.

J	Kravchenko, VV				Kravchenko, V. V.			Water Exchange in Small Riversheds With Severe Climatic Conditions During a Cold Period of a Year	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												Presented are the results of experimental studies into the interaction between the surface and subsurface water in 16 mountain river basins of East Sayan and Lake Baikal as carried out by the Irkutskbased Institute of Geography during 1984-1990. The research program included regular measurements of the thickness, area and volume of the surface and underground ice along the entire length of the valleys, pressure in closed lenses of underground waters, daily measurements of water discharges and chemical composition throughout the channel network. It was found that at the end of winter about 80-90% of the area of the valleys of the rivers under study are covered by aufeis and by the seasonal subsurface ice of a different genesis. Furthermore, about half the volume of the seasonal ice corresponds to the surface ice (river ice and aufeis), and the other half to the subsurface segregated and injection ice. It was further shown that the period of formation of the main bulk of ice begins and ends earlier in the sections closer to the mouth. The "wave" of maximum intensity of ice formation gradually moves the river upstream. The ice volume is the last to form in the upstream components of the river network. At this time, the ice formation of the other area of the watershed has terminated or its main part has formed already. A cryogenic barrage phenomenon occurs, as a result of which the channel network receives subsurface water which, under normal conditions, is not drained by the river. The winter river runoff increases from 50% in the sections close to the source to 5-10% at the mouth of the river.																			1875-3728	1875-371X				JUL	2020	41	3					284	292		10.1134/S1875372841030105	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1875372841030105													WOS:000597980800010

QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Despite the widespread application of tephra studies for dating and correlation of stratigraphic sequences ('tephrochronology'), questions remain over the reliability and replicability of tephra records from lake sediments and peats, particularly in sites >1000 km from source volcanoes. To address this, we examine the tephrostratigraphy of four pairs of lake and peatland sites in close proximity to one another (<10 km), and evaluate the extent to which the microscopic (crypto-) tephra records in lakes and peatlands differ. The peatlands typically record more cryptotephra layers than nearby lakes, but cryptotephra records from high-latitude peatlands can be incomplete, possibly due to tephra fallout onto snow and subsequent redistribution across the peatland surface by wind and during snowmelt. We find no evidence for chemical alteration of glass shards in peatland or lake environments over the time scale of this study (mid-to late- Holocene). Instead, the low number of basaltic cryptotephra layers identified in distal peatlands reflects the capture of only primary tephra-fall, whereas lakes concentrate tephra falling across their catchments which subsequently washes into the lake, adding to the primary tephra fallout received in the lake.

Evaporation in a Mediterranean environment by energy budget and Penman methods, Lake Baratz, Sardinia, Italy	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												In Mediterranean environments, evaporation is a key component of lake water budgets. This applies to Lake Baratz in Sardinia, Italy, a closed lake that almost dried up in 2008 after a succession of years with low seasonal rainfall. We used the energy budget method and Penman's equation to estimate evaporation over Lake Baratz. We measured, using a raft station, water temperature at the surface, at 1, 2, 4, 6m depth and at the bottom of the lake, as well as air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and net radiation over a period of 3 years. We also compared Penman's equation and the energy budget method in two other climatic zones using published data. Our results indicate that mean yearly evaporation over Lake Baratz was 950 mm. On an annual scale, evaporation estimated by Penman's method omitting heat storage as is usually done was 18% higher than by the energy budget method that included heat storage, with monthly differences ranging between -38 and +60 %. Including the heat storage term in Penman's equation changed the monthly values but did not change the yearly value significantly. Solar radiation and heat storage were found to be the most important energy fluxes to and from the lake and had the greatest effect on evaporation rates for the energy budget method. The bias between the two methods has a seasonal cycle due to the storage and release of energy from the lake. Energy advected to and from the lake by precipitation, surface water and ground water had minor effect on evaporation rates. Lake Baratz, like other lakes in a Mediterranean environment, is particularly sensitive to the summer hot and dry climate. In contrast, we found that rates of evaporation estimated from Penman and the energy budget methods over tropical African lakes were nearly constant over the entire year and the difference between the two methods smaller. Difference between the two methods for North American lakes is also smaller probably owing to the ice-cover season and to lower radiation and lower temperatures during summer.					; Giadrossich, Filippo/L-3496-2016; Cohen, Denis/P-2015-2016	pirastru, mario/0000-0001-6641-7026; Giadrossich, Filippo/0000-0002-7546-1632; Cohen, Denis/0000-0002-8262-9798													1027-5606	1607-7938					2015	19	5					2451	2468		10.5194/hess-19-2451-2015	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-19-2451-2015													WOS:000355319500020

CRUSTACEANS OF WRANGEL ISLAND (RUSSIA): SPECIES COMPOSITION, COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND VARIABILITY	NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH												High-latitude aquatic ecosystems and the communities inhabiting them are the key sites for environmental research and observations of global climate changes. Due to their specific traits, they are highly sensitive to any external effects and respond immediately to stressors. Monitoring the state of communities of invertebrates of such water bodies is one of the most relevant areas of Arctic research. Wrangel Island is a unique natural area that combines high-latitudinal conditions, endemism and specificity of insular fauna, as well as local features of its biogeographic position in the zone of interaction of Palearctic and Nearctic biota. This kind of research is an integral part of the investigations carried out on the island. However, the composition of the aquatic invertebrates of the island is very poorly studied. The current paper presents new data on the crustaceans of inland water bodies of the Wrangel Island State Nature Reserve (Chukotka, Russia). There are 17 species previously unknown for this territory. Analysis of the influence of environmental factors on the community structure of crustaceans has revealed the most important of them: the type of bottom sediment, size of the water bodies, the area of research and seasonality. Lakes with an area of more than 100 m(2) and with a silt or clay bottom were dominated by large (more than 0.7 mm) Copepoda of the order Calanoida: Diaptomus, Arctodiaptomus, Leptodiaptomus, Heterocope, Eurytemora, and Cladocera: Daphnia cf. middendorfiana. In thermocarst lakes, rich in detritus with size less than 50 m(2), were abundant small (less than 0.5 mm) members of Copepoda orders Cyclopoida and Harpacticoida. The seasonal variability of the zooplankton community structure was clearly expressed. During spring a complex of bento-plankton species with a minimal number of species was prevalent (at average 5 species). At the end of June, the juvenile stages of the copepods dominate, cladocerans appear, and the total species richness increased 4 times (20-24 species). In the middle of the summer in all water bodies there were numerous adult copepods and cladocerans. By the beginning of August, the diversity and abundance of copepods began to decline, against the background of the unchanged composition of mass species of Cladocera. Two main types of communities are allocated that maintain an interannual stability. The first one is dominated by Calanoida and branchiopods, the second one by representatives of Daphnia and Chydorus. It is noted that although the genera composition of crustaceans in water bodies hardly changes from year to year, the composition of species has been subject to significant variability. It is shown that the structure of zooplankton communities in Arctic water bodies is primarily determined by two types of environmental filters: local, related to the specificity of the water body due to the history of its formation, and seasonality.

The analyses are based on diatoms as well as carbon and nitrogen isotopes from bulk sediments in a 7.5-m-long sediment core retrieved from the drained fen of Agios Floros, at the northern banks of the ancient River Pamisos. The sequence consists of fen peat in the uppermost section underlain by lacustrine sediments, which are punctuated by two layers of clay with diatomaceous silt bands. High accumulation rate is recorded in the oldest part of the section (up to 23mm/yr), particularly during two decadal-long periods centered at c. 5700 and c. 5300 cal. BP. The diatom record reveals pronounced peaks in the planktonic taxon Cyclotella distinguenda, which correspond to the laminated sequences, reflecting the rapid development of a deep lake with an open water environment during these two time periods. Another two events with intermediate water levels are inferred at c. 5200 and c. 4600 cal. BP. These short-lived phases were probably, to a large extent, caused by local tectonic processes and the consequent hydrological anomalies of the nearby karst springs, although abrupt climatic changes with enhanced precipitation might have also played a role. At c. 4500 cal. BP, our data suggest the development of terrestrial conditions in this area, which can be attributed to the decreasing activity/dry up of springs, probably associated with more arid climate. After c. 2500 cal. BP, the diatom record infers a return to wetter conditions, probably as a response to more humid climate with marked seasonality and human activities, developing the present-day environment with cultivated and seasonally semi-flooded fields.					; Holmgren, Karin/HTT-0489-2023	Katrantsiotis, Christos/0000-0003-4881-2481; Skelton, Alasdair/0000-0002-3732-7993; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				FEB	2016	26	2					188	204		10.1177/0959683615596838	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683615596838													WOS:000368332200003
J	Geng, XL; Boufadel, MC				Geng, Xiaolong; Boufadel, Michel C.			Impacts of evaporation on subsurface flow and salt accumulation in a tidally influenced beach	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												We coupled a mass-transfer formulation of evaporation to the density-dependent variably saturated finite element model MARUN to predict the salinity under realistic conditions in a beach in the Gulf of Mexico. The results showed that evaporation almost doubled the pore water salt concentration in the intertidal zone in comparison to the case with no evaporation. The results also showed that for the relatively wet atmospheric conditions, the maximum evaporation did not occur from the supratidal zone, rather from the intertidal zone, and it was due to the difference in moisture between pore water and atmosphere. The highest salinity occurred during the spring tide period, and extended into the neap tide period. When the atmospheric condition was assumed to be constant and conducive to large evaporation (high temperature and low air humidity), the maximum salinity region shifted to the supratidal zone and persisted there due to low mixing. The maximum salinity value in the intertidal zone for this case was not larger than that of the variable atmospheric condition case. However, the maximum was more landward than the (more realistic) variable atmospheric condition case, which suggests that accurate characterization of pore water salinity in tidally influenced beaches requires accurate knowledge of atmospheric conditions in addition to beach and hydraulic properties. The constant atmospheric condition simulations suggest that antecedent extreme conditions greatly affect the salinity in the supratidal zone but they are dampened in the intertidal zone.																			0043-1397	1944-7973				JUL	2015	51	7					5547	5565		10.1002/2015WR016886	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015WR016886													WOS:000360080200037

Each sample was subjected to virome analysis using high-throughput sequencing technology. The number of viral reads was the lowest in the live honey bee group sample with 370,503 reads and the highest in the dead honey bee group sample with 42,659,622 reads. Viral contigs were matched with the viral genomes of the black queen cell virus, deformed wing virus, Israeli acute paralysis virus, and sacbrood virus, all of which have been previously reported in Korea. However, Apis rhabdovirus 5, bee macula-like virus, Varroa orthomyxovirus-1, Hubei partiti-like virus 34, Lake Sinai virus 2, 3, and 4, and the Ditton virus, were also discovered in this study, which are the first records in Korea. Plant viral sequences resembling those of Arabidopsis latent virus 1, and a novel viral sequence was also discovered. In the present study 55 complete viral genome sequences were identified. This study is the first virome analysis of domestic honey bees and provides the latest information on the diversity of honey bee viruses in Korea.

The precision of these and five additional published relationships was examined. The 95% confidence interval for the best available TP-CHL model is 30-325% of the calculated CHL value. Analysis of associated Florida monthly nutrient and CHL data indicate that the TP-CHL relationship is sigmoid, although a linear response is found for TP concentrations in the range of 3-160 mu g.L-1. The maximum CHL responses for a sigmoid curve and straight line are similar for TP concentrations of 3-100 mu g.L-1. Both relationships describe P limitation when the CHL response falls on or near the line and provide a benchmark to evaluate other limiting or colimiting factors that are indicated when the CHL response falls below the line. Florida and global data are similar, exhibiting a lessening of slope above a TP concentration of 100 mu g.L-1. A global median line is derived from a large population of lake data for use in general lake management.																			0706-652X					AUG	2000	57	8					1574	1583		10.1139/f00-090	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f00-090													WOS:000088273200005

However, the distribution of TEP, its precursor, and the contribution to the organic carbon pool in the large freshwater lake remain inadequately understood. Here, we focused on the spatial distribution of TEP and dissolved acidic polysaccharides (dAPS) in four typical seasons in Lake Taihu, the third-largest lake in China. TEP concentrations in Lake Taihu ranged from 0.05 to 5.19 mg Xeq/L, with a mean value of 1.31 +/- 1.08 mg Xeq/L. The concentration of dAPS in the lake averaged 3.7 +/- 2.19 mg Xeq/L (range, 0.19-13.12 mg Xeq/L). Higher content of TEP and dAPS was found in summer, and their distributions appeared to be influenced by the cyanobacterial blooms, as they showed significant correlations with chlorophyll-a content in Lake Taihu in summer. In addition, TEP accounted for an average of 24.3% of particulate organic carbon, and dAPS represented 25.9% of dissolved organic carbon. These results provide valuable insights into the contribution of TEP to organic carbon pools in inland waters and highlight the role of TEP in the carbon cycling of large freshwater lakes.

OCCURRENCE AND SEASONAL CHANGES OF N,N-DIETHYL-m-TOLUAMIDE (DEET) PESTICIDE IN MIDDLE SOUTH TURKEY SURFACE WATERS	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) is a widely used insect repellent and a very effective pesticide applied to skin or clothing to remove insects or rodents. It is also among personal care products. DEET can be toxic to birds, fishes and aquatic invertebrates. For this reason, determination of concentrations in surface waters is very important for living things that live in or feed in aquatic environments. This work was carried out in Ivriz, Ayranci, Godet, Sucullu, Uluborlu, Kozan, Mehmetli, Seyhan Dam Lakes, Golbasi, Azapli, Inekli Lakes and Ceyhan River in the Middle South of Turkey. During this study, DEET was detected in all surface water samples taken from lakes and Ceyhan River and the obtained average DEET concentrations are ranged from 0.57 to 80.10 ng/l. The highest concentration obtained was found in the Ceyhan River in summer. When the averages of DEET concentrations are listed, the first three are Ceyhan River, Golbasi Lake and Seyhan Dam Lake, respectively. Higher DEET concentrations were found in summer in most lakes and Ceyhan River. Despite the fact that the measured DEET concentrations in surface waters are well below the acute effect concentrations, but it is not known exactly how their effects will be when DEET behave with the other pollutants.

Hence, a change in timing of the mass-emergence of insects from lakes and wetlands, which is the crucial food source for waterfowl chicks, will likely result in a consumer/resource mismatch in a future climate change perspective. Specifically, we experimentally show that a moderate increase in temperature of 3 degrees C above ambient, expected to occur within 25-75 years, leads to a considerably (2 weeks) earlier, and more pronounced, peak in insect emergence (Chironomus sp). Moreover, by utilizing long-term Citizen Science databases, ranging over several decades, we also show that common waterfowl species are unable to significantly adjust their reproduction to fit future temperature increase. Hence, based on our data we predict a future mismatch between insect emergence and waterfowl species basing their reproduction on temperature. This will have a profound impact on reproductive success and population dynamics of many aquatic birds, as well as on freshwater biodiversity.

Our reconstruction finds a new mega-tripolar pattern of precipitation variations accompanying a continental-wide enrichment of delta 18Oc from the early to late Holocene over the entire ASM continental region. Precipitation peaked in the early Holocene over South Asia, northern China and southern China, but in the late Holocene over central China.

Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Vibrio cholerae and faecal streptococci were present in all water sources except for the boreholes and bowsers. Rivers, lake and wells showed the greatest diversity of 10, 5 and 6 species and relative density (rd) of 90.9, 83.4 and 61.67% respectively for the protozoan parasites. Cryptosporidium was identified in groundwater sources; wells (rd = 8.3%) and springs (rd = 41.7%) and identified in tap water (rd = 6.23%) and the Mukuvisi River downstream (rd = 8.3%). Entamoeba histolytica, Cyclospora, Isospora belli, Trichuris trichiura and Giardia lamblia were found in all water sources. Eggs/larvae of intestinal parasites; Ascaris lumbricoides, Strongyloides, Rhabditis, Taenia sp. and Schistosoma mansoni were identified in different water sources. Faecal coliform levels had a significant effect on the water sources' water quality with p = 0.018 in all sites except for the borehole whilst faecal streptococci had no significant impact with p = 0.513. The presence of at least one microbial pathogenic organism and parasites in most of the water sources poses a threat to the water quality and is a human health risk in the study areas.

However, their use in coastal seas and saline lakes can be hindered by species-mixing effects. We recently hypothesized that freshwater lakes are immune to species-mixing effects because they appear to exclusively host Group I haptophyte algae, which produce a distinct distribution of alkenones with a relatively consistent response of alkenone unsaturation to temperature. To evaluate this hypothesis and explore the geographic extent of Group I haptophytes, we analyzed alkenones in sediment and suspended particulate matter samples from lakes distributed throughout the mid- and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere (n = 30). Our results indicate that Group I-type alkenone distributions are widespread in freshwater lakes from a range of different climates (mean annual air temperature range: -17.3-10.9 degrees C; mean annual precipitation range: 125-1657 mm yr(-1); latitude range: 40-81 degrees N), and are commonly found in neutral to basic lakes (pH > 7.0), including volcanic lakes and lakes with mafic bedrock. We show that these freshwater lakes do not feature alkenone distributions characteristic of Group II lacustrine haptophytes, providing support for the hypothesis that freshwater lakes are immune to species-mixing effects. In lakes that underwent temporal shifts in salinity, we observed mixed Group I/II alkenone distributions and the alkenone contributions from each group could be quantified with the RIK37 index. Additionally, we observed significant correlations of alkenone unsaturation (U-37(K)) with seasonal and mean annual air temperature with this expanded freshwater lakes dataset, with the strongest correlation occurring during the spring transitional season (U-37(K) = 0.029 * T - 0.49; r(2) = 0.60; p < 0.0001). We present new sediment trap data from two lakes in northern Alaska (Toolik Lake, 68.632 degrees N, 149.602 degrees W; lake E5, 68.643 degrees N, 149.458 degrees W) that demonstrate the highest sedimentary fluxes of alkenones in the spring transitional season, concurrent with the period of lake ice melt and isothermal mixing.

Insight in the hydrochemical functioning of embanked polder catchments is highly relevant for improving the water quality in such areas or for reducing export loads to downstream water bodies. This paper introduces new insights in nutrient sources and transport processes in a polder in the Netherlands situated below sea level using high-frequency monitoring technology at the outlet, where the water is pumped into a higher situated lake, combined with a low-frequency water quality monitoring programme at six locations within the drainage area. Seasonal trends and short-scale temporal dynamics in concentrations indicated that the NO3 concentration at the pumping station originated from N loss from agricultural lands. The NO3 loads appear as losses via tube drains after intensive rainfall events during the winter months due to preferential flow through the cracked clay soil. Transfer function-noise modelling of hourly NO3 concentrations reveals that a large part of the dynamics in NO3 concentrations during the winter months can be related to rainfall. The total phosphorus (TP) concentration and turbidity almost doubled during operation of the pumping station, which points to resuspension of particulate P from channel bed sediments induced by changes in water flow due to pumping. Rainfall events that caused peaks in NO3 concentrations did not results in TP concentration peaks. The rainfall induced and NO3 enriched quick interflow, may also be enriched in TP but retention of TP due to sedimentation of particulate P then results in the absence of rainfall induced TP concentration peaks. Increased TP concentrations associated with run-off events is only observed during a rainfall event at the end of a freeze-thaw cycle. All these observations suggest that the P retention potential of polder water systems is primarily due to the artificial pumping regime that buffers high flows. As the TP concentration is affected by operation of the pumping station, timing of sampling relative to the operating hours of the pumping station should be accounted for when calculating P export loads, determining trends in water quality, or when judging water quality status of polder water systems.

Honey bees collected pollen from both native and introduced plants. They concentrated on anemophilous (wind-pollinated) forest trees, entomophilous (insect pollinated) fruit trees and early-blooming entomophilous herbs in the spring; later in the season they collected from entomophilous forage crops, weeds and shrubs that grow in disturbed habitats. The pollen assemblage from lake mud was dominated by anemophilous taxa. This assemblage is compared to the local pollen present in bee pellets.																			0008-3550						1978	92	4					359	368																WOS:A1978GF70500006

Nine cultivars were subjected to six management treatments (MT), differing in seeding, N, fungicide, and plant growth regulator rates. Environment, management treatments, and cultivar, as well as interactions, significantly affected grain yield, plant height, Belgium lodging score, harvest index, and percent leaf rust. Control of lodging and leaf rust (Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici) was profitable for susceptible cultivars, but unprofitable for resistant cultivars. The economic effect of specific management treatment X cultivar combinations varied from a loss of $26.30/acre to a net gain of $35/acre. Midwestern U.S. wheat farmers will become more profitable not by the adaption of Intensive Cereal Management (ICM) per se, but by using ICM components that solve particular problems associated with each production system and cultivar.																			0890-8524					JAN-MAR	1991	4	1					124	131		10.2134/jpa1991.0124	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jpa1991.0124													WOS:A1991FH27400023

In recent years, middle-late Miocene orbital-scale EASM variability has been depicted in lacustrine deposits from NE Tibetan basins, showing a dominant cyclicity of similar to 100 kyr eccentricity. However, EASM variability during the early Miocene time remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the sedimentary record of the early Miocene Xianshuihe Formation, Lanzhou Basin, in order to further constrain the NE Tibetan hydrological evolution and link it to orbital-scale monsoonal variability. By analyzing the lithology, magnetostratigraphy and cyclostratigraphic records of a 270-m section, we show that Lanzhou lake expansion cycles were consistently dominated by similar to 100 kyr eccentricity forcing in early Miocene, except for the similar to 20.8-19.8 Ma interval showing dominant obliquity control. These records are in agreement with deep-sea oxygen isotopic records, and are potentially linked to Antarctic ice sheet modulations related the precession amplitude modulation by eccentricity. A weakening of weathering intensity in Lanzhou Basin after 20.8 Ma may be attributed to orogenic barriers for westerly moisture and weakened surface temperature resulted from the rapid uplift of NE Tibet and surrounding mountains in the time interval of late Oligocene-early Miocene.

J	Fer, I; Lemmin, U; Thorpe, SA				Fer, I; Lemmin, U; Thorpe, SA			Winter cascading of cold water in Lake Geneva - art. no. 3060	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												[1] During the winters of 1998 and 1999, observations were made of the cascading of cold water from the nearshore, shallow "shelf'' zones and down the sloping sides of Lake Geneva. Cascading starts on the average 10 hours after the onset of surface cooling. The draining cold water descends like a gravity current, and the downslope speed of the head of these slugs of cold water, U, has a mean value of 5.2 cm s(-1), with slugs persisting, on the average, for 8 hours. When the Monin-Obukov length scale at the water surface, L, is negative, implying convection occurs, and (d) over bar/\L\> 1, where d is the mean shelf depth, the nondimensionalized speed of the front of "slugs,'' U/b(1/3) is found to be 1.3 +/- 0.4, where b is the surface buoyancy flux integrated over the time period from one slug to the next. Each slug is unsteady, the head being followed by several fronts in which the temperature of the current decreases and its thickness increases. These fronts travel faster than the mean flow by a factor of r = 1.38 +/- 0.3. Dynamical similarities are found with roll waves observed in turbulent open channel flows. The circulation induced by the cascade is found to give a positive skewness to the time derivatives of near-surface temperature in shallow waters, in contrast with negative values close to the slope. The volume of cold water carried by a slug increases with downslope distance as a consequence of turbulent entrainment and the contribution of convectively unstable plumes from the surface. The average volume carried by the slug across the 21 m depth contour is about 1.9 times the volume of water in shallower water (i.e., that on the shelf between shore and a depth of 21 m), implying that cascading is an efficient means of flushing shelf water. Integrated around the lake the mean total volume flux amounts to 11.5 the average winter river inflow.

J	Elsawwaf, M; Willems, P				Elsawwaf, Mohamed; Willems, Patrick			Analysis of the climate variability on Lake Nasser evaporation based on the Bowen ratio energy budget method	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Variations in lake evaporation have a significant impact on the energy and water budgets of lakes. Understanding these variations and the role of climate is important for water resources management as well as predicting future changes in lake hydrology as a result of climate change. This study presents a comprehensive, 10-year analysis of seasonal, intraseasonal, and interannual variations in lake evaporation for Lake Nasser in South Egypt. Meteorological and lake temperature measurements were collected from an instrumented platform (Raft floating weather station) at 2 km upstream of the Aswan High Dam. In addition to that, radiation measurements at three locations on the lake: Allaqi, Abusembel and Arqeen (respectively at 75, 280 and 350 km upstream of the Aswan High Dam) are used. The data were analyzed over 14-day periods from 1995 to 2004 to provide bi-weekly energy budget estimates of evaporation rate. The mean evaporation rate for lake Nasser over the study period was 5.88 mm day(-1), with a coefficient of variation of 63%. Considerable variability in evaporation rates was found on a wide range of timescales, with seasonal changes having the highest coefficient of variation (32%), followed by the intraseasonal (28%) and interannual timescales (11.6%; for summer means). Intraseasonal changes in evaporation were primarily associated with synoptic weather variations, with high evaporation events tending to occur during incursions of cold, dry air (due, in part, to the thermal lag between air and lake temperatures). Seasonal variations in evaporation were largely driven by temperature and net energy advection, but are out-of-phase with changes in wind speed. On interannual timescales, changes in summer evaporation rates were strongly associated with changes in net energy advection and showed only moderate connections to variations in temperature or humidity.

J	Clark, BJ; Paterson, AM; Jeziorski, A; Kelsey, S				Clark, Bev J.; Paterson, Andrew M.; Jeziorski, Adam; Kelsey, Susan			Assessing variability in total phosphorus measurements in Ontario lakes	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												In most Ontario lakes, phosphorus is present in trace quantities, making the precise measurement of concentrations difficult. The considerable variation that results in many datasets can be attributed to imprecise analysis. Even with precise analysis, substantial variation in ice-free whole-lake, mean mixed layer, and spring turnover total phosphorus (TP) concentrations often remain, both between years and within a given year. Lake managers have adopted many strategies to address these issues. Whole-lake TP concentrations expressed as ice-free season means are difficult to derive because they require the collection of numerous, volume-weighted samples often from multiple lake layers. As a result, spring turnover or ice-free-mean, mixed layer TP concentrations are often used to characterize the trophic status of a lake or to describe the nutrients available for primary production. These different phosphorus characterizations will vary between years, leading many lake managers to use long-term (multiple year) means to describe trophic status. The ability to interpret natural variation or trends in these data can be reduced by any bias introduced through sample collection and storage (container) methods or as a result of sample contamination by zooplankton, which can produce high sample TP concentrations. Much variability can be reduced through precise analysis, and most sources of error can be eliminated by sampling directly into the same borosilicate glass tubes used to digest samples prior to analysis and by coarse filtering water samples in situ to 80 mu m to eliminate large zooplankton. We demonstrated the importance of collecting precise TP data and presented the variation associated with 25 years of TP measurements in Ontario, Precambrian Shield lakes. We also demonstrated various sample collection strategies that can be used to characterize the nutrient status of lakes and explained how the interpretation of these can be affected by variability in the results.

Ground Temperatures in Permafrost South of Treeline, Mackenzie Delta, Northwest Territories	PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES												Surface conditions and ground temperatures from 50-cm to 20-m depth were measured at 26 forested sites in the Mackenzie Delta, to determine if differences in forest structure and organic cover between four common white spruce forest community types were associated with variations in ground temperature. The mean annual temperature at 1-m depth wits lowest (-4.4 degrees C) in the closed/ spruce-feathermoss (CSF) community associated with a thick canopy and thin snow cover, and highest in the recent permafrost of the spruce/alder-bearberry (SAB) community (-1.0 degrees C) with an open canopy and deep snow. The open-canopy spruce/crowberry-lichen (SCL) forest, with a thick surface organic cover and deep snow, had a higher mean annual temperature at 1-m depth (-2.1 degrees C) than the CSF forest, indicating the importance of canopy cover for snow accumulation and ground heat loss in winter. Seasonal and inter-annual variation of 4-m ground temperatures was greatest beneath the CSF community, highlighting the importance of greater winter cooling due to a thin snow cover and a lower unfrozen water content. Temperatures at 20-m depth ranged from -0.6 degrees C to -1.5 degrees C in SAB forests, and were significantly lower in CSF, open/spruce-feathermoss and SCL communities (-1.6 degrees C to -2.9 degrees C). Variation in near-surface temperatures between spruce forest types diminishes with depth due to the thermal influence of water bodies. There was no significant variation of ground temperatures at 20-m depth within spruce forest communities in different parts of the delta.

J	Rouse, WR				Rouse, WR			Progress in hydrological research in the Mackenzie GEWEX study	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES					Annual Meeting of the Canadian Geophysical Union (CGU-HS)	MAY, 1999	ALBERTA, CANADA	Canadian Geophys Union				This paper reports some of the achievements in hydrological research associated with the Mackenzie GEWEX Study (MAGS). MAGS is a multifaceted study of the energy and water cycle in the Mackenzie River Basin, north-western Canada, and emphasizes cold-region processes and modelling. It pursues methodologies of scaling-up process studies to a large river basin that has few measurement sites. This methodology involves new developments, adapting mid-latitude algorithms to the high latitude setting and promoting the use of remote sensing tools for scaling-up. Intensive hydrological process studies have been concentrated at a number of sites. These have been chosen to represent different biophysical facets of the Mackenzie River Basin. They include northern basins in open tundra and at tree-line, a western basin representing the hilly and mountainous western side of the basin, central basin sites of wetlands, Precambrian Shield terrain and the Mackenzie Basin counterpart of the large Laurentian Great Lakes. The most southerly site represents a mixed-wood boreal forest site that is undergoing land-use change as a result of forest harvesting. Regional community model analysis indicates that processes of lee cyclogenesis result in differential input of precipitation across the basin. Significant results centre on models of snow accumulation featuring the role of blowing snow, intercepted snow and snowmelt. These models emphasize the importance of snow patchiness to speed of melt. Snowmelt infiltration into frozen soils is important in controlling runoff, and tundra microlandforms play a unique role in determining the surface runoff characteristics. On the western margins of the basin, there is a very significant difference in the hydrological behaviour of slopes of different aspects as a result of differences in permafrost and vegetation. In the central basin, a deeper understanding of components of the water budget is being gained through stable isotope analysis of wetland waters. The importance of wetland-controlled spring flow, and its impact on spring breakup characteristics on the Mackenzie River, is being explored. A quite unique influence of Precambrian Shield terrain on the water balance results from the large storage capacity of deep bedrock fissures. They can substantially delay streamflow response to snowmelt. The large lakes of the Mackenzie Basin echo, only in part, the behaviour of the Laurentian Great Lakes. A surprising and rapid response of evaporation to warming during the 1998 El Nino warming episode occurred, which could serve as a surrogate for warming resulting from climate change. In the southern and central forested parts of the basin, vegetation types play a substantial role in the water balance, particularly in influencing interception and subsequent sublimation during winter. The latter is an important component of the water balance and a major cold-region process, the modelling of which is an important achievement of MAGS. Remote sensing provides passive microwave satellite data to help identify snow-water characteristics and calculate the break-up and freeze-up dates of the Mackenzie great lakes, and AVHRR data to help develop algorithms for evapotranspiration modelling, and to use in calculating the surface solar radiation budget on a basin scale. Ongoing research is successfully integrating a GCM model land-surface scheme, regional community climate model and hydrological model to simulate the water balance of sub-basins and of the total Mackenzie River Basin system. Expected achievements at the end of MAGS Phase 1 are outlined and some goals for future MAGS research are discussed.

Brook trout first appeared in the upstream trap on June 24 and continued to run through July. Migration was closely associated with warm lake surface temperatures (60[degree]-66[degree] F.) and cool minimum stream temperatures (37[degree]-55[degree] F.). Thirty-two percent of the hybrid trout recovered in the trap, tagged, and released in the lake re-entered the trap one or more times. Five of 25 trapped and tagged brook trout also re-entered the trap one or more times. A population estimate in May 1962 indicated that 10.7% of the hybrids and 24.7% of the brook trout present in the lake entered the inlet trap.																			0033-0779						1966	28	3					146	+		10.1577/1548-8640(1966)28[146:TSMOHA]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8640(1966)28[146:TSMOHA]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A19668078300008

Studying the Dynamics of the Transformation Processes for Nitrogen and Phosphorus Compounds in the Ecosystem of the Vistula Lagoon of the Baltic Sea Using Mathematical Modeling	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												A systematic study of the interaction of hydrobiological, hydrochemical, hydrological, and hydrophysical processes that occur in the ecosystem of the Vistula Lagoon (VL) of the Baltic Sea has been carried out using mathematical modeling and taking into account the processes in the active layer of bottom sediments (BSs). The features of the dynamics of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds, the turnover time, and the components of the balance of compounds of biogenic elements in the VL ecosystem, as well as the degree of their temporal variability, have been analyzed. It is shown that the variability of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in the aquatic environment increases in spring and autumn periods. This is due to an increase in river flow into the lagoon and an increase in the level of external biogenic load on the water area of the VL. Model calculations of matter fluxes allow us to state that the inputs of dissolved organic and suspended matter into the lagoon from external sources and the removal to the Baltic Sea are important processes that significantly affect their content in the VL ecosystem. It has been established that under strong winds the process of sedimentation of suspensions can be largely blocked, and the intensity of BS resuspension can increase significantly. An analysis of the main qualitative and quantitative features of the nature of the temporal dynamics of the DON and DOP turnover times, as well as the mineral compounds of nitrogen and phosphorus, indicates a close conjugation of the processes of transformation of dissolved organic and inorganic substances in the water of the VL. A quantitative assessment of the processes of consumption and excretion of compounds of biogenic elements by different groups of aquatic organisms has been performed, and the important role of heterotrophic bacterioplankton and protozoa in the processes of transformation of compounds of nutrients in the VL ecosystem has been shown. The model can be used for scenario modeling and analyzing possible changes in the VL ecosystem under changing climatic and anthropogenic conditions.

Shengjin and Caizi Lakes, located along the Yangtze River, are important stopover and wintering wetlands for migratory waterbirds in the East Asia-Australasian Flyway. The heavy metal, microbial communities, and metabolites in wintering bean geese (Anser fabalis) were analysed in Shengjin (n = 15) and Caizi Lakes (n = 15). In the faecal samples, As, Cr, and Hg concentrations differed significantly between the two sites, whereas the levels of Cd and Pb were not significantly different. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidota were the dominant gut microbial phyla in geese. The Shannon-Wiener's index and PLS-DA analysis results showed significant differences between geese at the two sites. Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) tests showed that Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas, and Janthinobacterium were significantly enriched in the Shengjin Lake geese, whereas Arthrobacter and Sporosarcina were significantly enriched in the Caizi Lake geese. The LC-MS results indicated that lipids, lipid-like molecules, organic acids and derivatives, and organoheterocyclic compounds were the dominant in faecal metabolic profiles. PLS-DA revealed that all Shengjin Lake and Caizi Lake geese produced distinct clusters. A total of 135 pathways were found to be different between the Shengjin and Caizi lake samples, according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathway. Correlation analysis revealed that heavy metals affected the gut microbial community and metabolite composition. A significant correlation was also observed between the gut metabolites and microorganisms. Therefore, our study provides early warnings of environmental pollution of wetland ecosystems for migratory waterbirds.																				2351-9894				OCT	2025	62								e03781	10.1016/j.gecco.2025.e03781	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2025.e03781													WOS:001545674200002

Petre (on the north shore of Lake Ontario) between the spring of 1987 and the spring of 1989 using a gas and particle (GAP) sampler which employs a multiannular diffusion denuder to trap the vapor-phase constituents. During October 1987 at Turkey Lake, HCB, alpha-HCH, and gamma-HCH were all exclusively in the vapor phase. At Pt. Petre, during November and March when comparable temperatures prevailed, the vapor-phase components for HCB, alpha-HCH, and gamma-HCH were 96.6%, 97.6%, and 100% respectively. The overall method detection limits for HCB, alpha-HCH and gamma-HCH were 7, 14, and 15 pg/m3. The alpha-HCH/gamma-HCH ratio was always greater than 1.8 and generally between 6 and 10, indicating the detection of technical grade HCH and/or the environmental isomerization of the gamma-form to the alpha-form.

We examined the temperature patterns of two subboreal outlet streams in north-central British Columbia for I year before and 3 years after clearcut logging and found only modest changes (averaging 0.05-1.1degreesC) with respect to summer daily maximum and minimum temperatures, diurnal fluctuations, and stream cooling. A multistream comparative survey conducted in the same geographic region revealed that streams headed by small lakes or swamps tended to cool as they flowed downstream, and headwater streams warmed, regardless of whether or not timber harvesting took place. Stream cooling was attributed to a combination of warm outlet temperatures (promoted by the presence of the lakes) and cold groundwater inflows. A regression model revealed that summertime downstream warming or cooling in headwater and outlet streams could be predicted by upstream maximum summer temperatures and canopy cover. Lentic water bodies and groundwater inflows are important determinants of stream temperature patterns in subboreal forests and may subsequently moderate their responses to streamside harvesting.																			0706-652X					DEC	2002	59	12					1886	1900		10.1139/F02-158	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F02-158													WOS:000180811800005

Holocene Indian Summer Monsoon variability from the core monsoon zone of India, a pollen-based review	GRANA												Palaeoclimatic reconstructions from sediment cores of the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, and other terrestrial ecosystems including lakes, peatlands and proglacial areas from the Indian subcontinent have been used to understand the past Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) variability. The core monsoon zone (CMZ) of India is one of the most important regions to understand past ISM dynamics. Pollen based palaeoclimatic reconstructions in the CMZ of India suggest a progressive increase in the ISM during the Holocene. However, the results suggesting a weak ISM after the Younger Dryas (YD) cooling event are contrary to the observations made in other parts of the country. Besides this, the minor climatic fluctuations are difficult to find in most of the reconstructions. This may be attributed to poor sample resolution and chronological control. These limitations make it difficult to ascertain whether the response of vegetation to climatic change has been insignificant or whether this change is not reflected in the proxy (proxy response). As a consequence, we argue that pollen based palaeoclimatic reconstructions are one of the most widely used proxies and will be meaningful as backbone for climate models only if the reconstructions become more quantitative.					; ali, sheikh'nawaz/NRY-7735-2025	Shekhar, Mayank/0000-0002-4245-8605; 													0017-3134	1651-2049				SEP 3	2019	58	5					311	327		10.1080/00173134.2019.1629695	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00173134.2019.1629695		JUL 2019											WOS:000476124600001

Tracking Overwintering Areas of Fish-Eating Birds to Identify Mercury Exposure	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Migration patterns are believed to greatly influence concentrations of contaminants in birds due to accumulation in spatially and temporally distinct ecosystems. Two species of fish-eating birds, the Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) and the Caspian Tern (Hydroprogne caspia) breeding in Lake Ontario were chosen to measure the impact of overwintering location on mercury concentrations ([Hg]). We characterized (1) overwintering areas using stable isotopes of hydrogen (delta H-2) and band recoveries, and (2) overwintering habitats by combining information from stable isotopes of sulfur (delta S-34), carbon (delta C-13), nitrogen (delta N-15), and delta H-2 in feathers grown during the winter. Overall, overwintering location had a significant effect on [Hg]. Both species showed high [Hg] in C-13-rich habitats. In situ production of Hg (e.g., through sulfate reducing bacteria in sediments) and allochthonous import could explain high [Hg] in birds visiting C-13-rich habitats. Higher [Hg] were found in birds with high delta H-2, suggesting that Hg is more bioavailable in southern overwintering locations. Hotspot maps informed that higher [Hg] in birds were found at the limit of their southeastern overwintering range. Mercury concentrations in winter feathers were positively related to predicted spatial pattern of [Hg] in fish using the National Descriptive Model of Mercury in Fish (NDMMF) based on bird spatial assignment (using delta H-2). This study indicates that the overwintering location greatly influences [Hg].					; Lavoie, Raphael/B-4039-2011; Campbell, Linda/C-1257-2009	Kyser, Kurt/0000-0001-9667-4103; Lavoie, Raphael A./0000-0003-3381-3254; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				JAN 20	2015	49	2					863	872		10.1021/es502813t	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es502813t								25514043					WOS:000348332400022

Orographic Effects on Landfalling Lake-Effect Systems	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Landfalling lake- and sea-effect (hereafter lake-effect) systems often interact with orography, altering the distribution and intensity of precipitation, which frequently falls as snow. In this study, we examine the influence of orography on two modes of lake-effect systems: long-lake-axis-parallel (LLAP) bands and broad-coverage, open-cell convection. Specifically, we generate idealized large-eddy simulations of a LLAP band produced by an oval lake and broad-coverage, open-cell convection produced by an open lake (i.e., without flanking shorelines) with a downstream coastal plain, 500-m peak, and 2000-m ridge. Without terrain, the LLAP band intersects a coastal baroclinic zone over which ascent and hydrometeor mass growth are maximized, with transport and fallout producing an inland precipitation maximum. The 500-m peak does not significantly alter this structure, but slightly enhances precipitation due to orographic ascent, increased hydrometeor mass growth, and reduced subcloud sublimation. In contrast, a 2000-m ridge disrupts the band by blocking the continental flow that flanks the coastlines. This, combined with differential surface heating between the lake and land, leads to low-level flow reversal, shifting the coastal baroclinic zone and precipitation maximum offshore. In contrast, the flow moves over the terrain in open lake, open-cell simulations. Over the 500-m peak, this yields an increase in the frequency of weaker (<1 m s(-1)) updrafts and weak precipitation enhancement, although stronger updrafts decline. Over the 2000-m ridge, however, buoyancy and convective vigor increase dramatically, contributing to an eightfold increase in precipitation. Overall, these results highlight differences in the influence of orography on two common lake-effect modes. Significance StatementLandfalling lake- and sea-effect snowstorms frequently interact with hills, mountains, and upland regions, altering the distribution and intensity of snowfall. Using high-resolution numerical modeling with simplified lake shapes and terrain features, we illustrate how terrain features affect two common types of lake-effect storms and why long-lake-axis-parallel (LLAP) bands can feature high precipitation rates but weaker orographic enhancement than broad-coverage, open-cell convection.

The He-3/He-4 ratio decreases with increasing distance from the central crater of the volcano to the sampling site whereas the deltaC-13 value of CO2 increases with the distance. This tendency suggests that high He-3/He-4-low deltaC-13 magmatic gas is mixed with and/or diluted by low He-3/He-4-high deltaC-13 crustal gas with increasing distance from the crater. Alternatively, the variation of deltaC-13 values may be the result of isotope fractionation during migration since the isotope shift is relatively small. Based on the apparent mixing trend in a He-3/He-4-delta-C-13 diagram, the magmatic He and CO2 in the volcano may have a He-3/He-4 ratio of 8 R(atm) and a deltaC-13 value of -3.2 parts-per-thousand, respectively. The CO2/He-3 ratios show a positive correlation with temperature of fumaroles or hot springs, which may be caused by a difference of temperature dependencies of the solubilities between CO2 and He.

Post-Late Glacial calcareous tufas from the Kurai fault zone (Southeastern Gorny Altai, Russia)	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Calcareous tufa deposits have been discovered in the Chibitka River valley near Lake Cheybek-Kohl, at the junction of the Kurai and Teletsk-Kurai large active faults in the southeastern Gorny Altai, Russia, at an altitude of 1800-2000 m. Fossil tufa is composed of calcite and cements Holocene grey colluvium and glacial till deposited by the Late Glacial Chibitka Glacier. Current tufa precipitation has been observed from a low-flow spring with cold (10 degrees C) HCO3-SO4-Ca-Mg water, pH = 6.86. The stable isotope composition of spring water is -5.8 parts per thousand VPDB delta C-13 of dissolved inorganic carbon and -14.5 parts per thousand VSMOW delta O-18. Modern tufa consists of thin laminated Mg-calcite and Sr-aragonite crusts, with abundant algae and biofilms on their surfaces. Both modem and fossil tufas are depleted in REE (a total of 0.40-16.4 ppm and 0.40-3.80 ppm, respectively) and share similar PAAS-normalised REE + Y spectra with HREE enrichment and slight progressive LREE depletion. The modern tufas show positive delta C-13 values of 0.1 parts per thousand to 0.9 parts per thousand VPDB while the fossil ones have an isotopically lighter composition of delta C-13 = -4.1 parts per thousand to -1.9 parts per thousand VPDB; the delta O-18 range is very narrow (-13.0 to -13.8 parts per thousand VPDB). Both stable isotope and trace-element signatures (including REE patterns) of the tufas indicate precipitation from cold groundwaters subjected to prolonged interaction with a carbonate aquifer (the Baratal Group of limestone and dolostone) in a cold continental climate similar to the present conditions. Tufa deposition in the Lake Cheybek-Kohl area began with the onset of post-Late Glacial global warming and permafrost degradation. Unlike the fossil tufa formation, current precipitation of freshwater carbonates has been microbially mediated. The discovered tufa deposits provide new palaeoclimatic and active tectonic proxies in the southeastern Gomy Altai. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The second largest Peruvian city is a rapidly expanding economic centre and is classified by UNESCO as World Heritage. We apply the Bayesian Event Tree code for Volcanic Hazard (BET_VH) to produce probabilistic hazard maps for the predominant volcanic phenomena that may affect c. 900,000 people living around the volcano. The methodology accounts for the natural variability displayed by volcanoes in their eruptive behaviour, such as different types/sizes of eruptions and possible vent locations. For this purpose, we treat probabilistically several model runs for some of the main hazardous phenomena (lahars, pyroclastic density currents (PDCs), tephra fall and ballistic ejecta) and data from past eruptions at El Misti (tephra fall, PDCs and lahars) and at other volcanoes (PDCs). The hazard maps, although neglecting possible interactions among phenomena or cascade effects, have been produced with a homogeneous method and refer to a common time window of 1 year. The probability maps reveal that only the north and east suburbs of Arequipa are exposed to all volcanic threats except for ballistic ejecta, which are limited to the uninhabited but touristic summit cone. The probability for pyroclastic density currents reaching recently expanding urban areas and the city along ravines is around 0.05 %/year, similar to the probability obtained for roof-critical tephra loading during the rainy season. Lahars represent by far the most probable threat (around 10 %/year) because at least four radial drainage channels can convey them approximately 20 km away from the volcano across the entire city area in heavy rain episodes, even without eruption. The Rio Chili Valley represents the major concern to city safety owing to the probable cascading effect of combined threats: PDCs and rockslides, dammed lake break-outs and subsequent lahars or floods. Although this study does not intend to replace the current El Misti hazard map, the quantitative results of this probabilistic multi-hazard assessment can be incorporated into a multi-risk analysis, to support decision makers in any future improvement of the current hazard evaluation, such as further land-use planning and possible emergency management.					; Tonini, Roberto/A-1932-2012; Constantinescu, Robert/D-3457-2018; Sandri, Laura/AET-0489-2022; Constantinescu, Robert/ABE-9459-2021	Sandri, Laura/0000-0002-3254-2336; Tonini, Roberto/0000-0001-7617-7206; Constantinescu, Robert/0000-0002-1532-904X; Biass, Sebastien/0000-0002-1919-9473; 													0258-8900	1432-0819				FEB	2014	76	2							771	10.1007/s00445-013-0771-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00445-013-0771-9													WOS:000332337200001

The tufas, composed mainly of calcite that formed at the interface between an ancient alkaline lake and ground or spring waters, have textures similar to those of microbially mediated terrestrial stromatolites and travertines. The tufas have elevated concentrations of a number of trace elements including Mn, Fe, Sr and U. Synchrotron X-ray fluorescence analyses show that U concentrations can exceed 500 p.p.m. X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicates that the U in these samples is incorporated as U(IV). It is suggested here that alkaline lake waters had a high U/Ca ratio and tufa calcite formed where groundwater or (possibly epithermal) springs brought in Ca and trace elements such as Sr. The rapid, and possibly microbially mediated, precipitation of calcite allowed for incorporation of high concentrations of trace metals as either structural substitutes or extremely fine-scale inclusions.					; Schultheis, Jennifer/AAN-7882-2020	Lanzirotti, Antonio/0000-0002-7597-5924; Montanez, Isabel/0000-0003-0492-3796; Rasbury, Troy/0000-0003-0591-4461; 													0037-0746					JUN	2004	51	3					433	453		10.1111/j.1365-3091.2004.00631.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.2004.00631.x													WOS:000221544500003

For migratory birds, long-distance traveling poses selection pressures on their gut microbiota, ultimately affecting the birds' health, fitness, ecology, and evolution. However, our understanding of mechanisms that underlie the assembly of the gut microbiome of migratory birds is limited. In this study, the gut microbiota of winter migratory birds in the Poyang Lake wetland was characterized using MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. The sampled bird included herbivorous, carnivorous, and omnivorous birds from a total of 17 species of 8 families. Our results showed that the gut microbiota of migratory birds was dominated by four major bacterial phyla: Firmicutes (47.8%), Proteobacteria (18.2%), Fusobacteria (12.6%), and Bacteroidetes (9.1%). Dietary specialization outweighed the phylogeny of birds as an important factor governing the gut microbiome, mainly through regulating the deterministic processes of homogeneous selection and stochastic processes of homogeneous dispersal balance. Moreover, the omnivorous had more bacterial diversity than the herbivorous and carnivorous. Microbial networks for the gut microbiome of the herbivorous and carnivorous were less integrated, i.e., had lower average node degree and greater decreased network stability upon node attack removal than those of the omnivorous birds. Our findings advance the understanding of host-microbiota interactions and the evolution of migratory bird dietary flexibility and diversification.					王, 斌华/OGQ-1071-2025; Mou, Xiaozhen/AAG-2806-2020; Liu, Ya-Jun/ABF-9182-2022	Zhang, Xiaofeng/0000-0003-2738-3286; Liu, Yajun/0009-0009-8706-3656; 														1664-302X				SEP 23	2022	13								973469	10.3389/fmicb.2022.973469	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.973469								36212828					WOS:000871750400001

River floods, density currents and snow-avalanches have deposited distinct 'event layers' at the lake floor throughout this time interval. In this study, a novel approach has been applied to distinguish event layers from the continuous background sedimentation, using Rb/Sr-ratios from X-Ray Fluorescence data. Grain-size distribution and the sedimentological parameters 'mean' and 'sorting' were used to further infer the depositional processes behind each layer. Our data suggest a record dominated by snow-avalanches, with the largest activity occurring during the 'Little Ice Age' (LIA). This increase in snow-avalanche activity observed during the LIA was probably caused by a combination of generally increasing winter precipitation and the advance of local glaciers towards the steep valley sides. Several fluctuations in snow-avalanche activity are also recognized prior to the LIA. Proxies of glacial activity from the background sediments indicate a similar development as earlier palaeoclimatic reconstructions from the area. It differs from previous reconstructions, however, by suggesting a lower glacial activity in the period from 2200 to 1000 cal. yr BP.					; Ariztegui, Daniel/AFU-2302-2022; Waldmann, Nicolas/AAC-3974-2020	Vasskog, Kristian/0000-0002-4703-959X; Ariztegui, Daniel/0000-0001-7775-5127; Waldmann, Nicolas/0000-0003-4627-208X													0959-6836	1477-0911				JUN	2011	21	4					597	614		10.1177/0959683610391316	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683610391316													WOS:000290946800007
J	Nitschke, CR				Nitschke, CR			Does forest harvesting emulate fire disturbance? A comparison of effects on selected attributes in coniferous-dominated headwater systems	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The emulation of natural disturbances is seen by many as an important management paradigm for achieving sustainable ecosystem management. To successfully emulate natural disturbances, managers must first have an understanding of the complex interactions that occur to the biophysical and chemical attributes of an ecosystem for both the natural and the "emulating" disturbance. The management of riparian ecosystems is an important issue faced by managers since the type of harvesting treatment can have a significant influence on the aquatic component. The removal or retention of riparian forests can have a direct influence on water quality and quantity, particularly on the smaller systems that are found at the headwaters of catchments, but do these treatments invoke a similar response as wildfire? To determine if emulation occurs, the affects of forest harvesting treatments and wildfire on temperature, water chemistry, summer stream flow, and sedimentation in headwater systems were compared using a meta-analysis. A statistically significant difference was found for temperature response between partial/selective harvesting and wildfire, but not after clear-cut harvesting. Water chemistry showed statistically significant differences for I I out of 14 tested attributes, with dissolved organic carbon exhibiting the most marked difference. A significant difference was identified between clear-cut harvesting and wildfire for summer stream flow but not between wildfire and partial/ selective harvest systems. Forest harvesting operations were found to emulate sedimentation through forest roads but not harvest treatment. Partial/selective harvest systems may offer the greatest emulation congruency versus clear-cut harvest systems in terms of overall headwater response and recovery. Partial/selective harvest systems combined with prescribed burning may provide managers with the best solution when attempting to emulate wildfire in headwater systems and reduce the detrimental impact of perturbation on these systems.

Mass increases of 2000-2900 kg (35-50 .mu.g/l) were measured, corresponding to internal supply rates of 240-680 kg/wk over a 3-9 wk interval. After anaerobic conditions developed in late June, release from the profundal zone sediments contributed significant amounts of P to lake water. Sediment chemical properties were determined to estimate the size of the P reservoir in the profundal zone (at water depths > 6.5 m). The P content of the surficial profundal zone sediments was 0.2-0.5% (dry weight) and a significant fraction was potentially mobile (NaOH extractable). The upper 10 cm of these sediments contain 50,000 kg of potentially mobile P, of which a small fraction is released each summer. Although external sources of P have been reduced by about 80%, the feedback of P from the sediments supports the productivity of Shagawa Lake and may continue to do so for many years.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1981	26	4					740	753		10.4319/lo.1981.26.4.0740	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1981.26.4.0740													WOS:A1981MB81000013

Ecological and phylogenetic aspects of the spring diet of three palaearctic species of swans	BMC ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The quality of swans' nutrition at spring migration stopovers is important for their successful breeding. It is of great interest to study the differences in nutrition of different swan species when sharing the same habitat. Microscopic analysis of Cygnus olor, C. cygnus, and C. columbianus bewickii feces collected in the eastern part of the Gulf of Finland in February-April 2014-2019 was performed. We measured food preferences of the three swan species using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). The width and overlap of dietary niches were also calculated. The diet of C. olor consists almost entirely of soft submerged aquatic vegetation, mainly macroalgae. Samples of the other two species except macroalgae contained large amounts of young shoots and roots of rigid semi-submerged and coastal vegetation. The dietary niche of C. cygnus is the most isolated because it is dominated by thick rhizomes of Phragmites australis, which are hardly used by other swan species. The diet of Bewick's swans was similar in many respects to that of the Mute swan, but Bewick's swans much more often preferred vegetative parts of submerged and semi-submerged plants, such as Stuckenia pectinata, Potamogeton perfoliatus, Sparganium sp., Nuphar lutea, and others. Notably, the dietary niches of Mute swan and Whooper swan overlapped as much as possible in February March during a period of severe food shortage, in contrast to later periods in spring when food was more abundant and varied. In general, differences in diets are well explained by differences in the morphology of birds. Comparison of tarsometatarsus indices shows that C. olor is the most water-related species. C. olor has the longest neck and its beak has the strongest filter features, whereas beaks of the other two species shows noticeable "goose-like grazing" features. Moreover, C. Cygnus has the most powerful beak. These features are due to the history of species. The formation of C. olor occurred during the Miocene-Pliocene of the Palaearctic in the warm eutrophic marine lagoons of the Paratethys with abundant soft submerged vegetation. The evolution of C. cygnus and C. c. bewickii took place in Pleistocene. At that time, periglacial and thermokarst water bodies on permafrost became widespread in the Palearctic, as well as dystrophic peat lakes with much poorer submerged aquatic vegetation, but well-developed coastal and semi-submerged vegetation.

Buffering of recovery from acidification by organic acids	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT					5th International Symposium on Ecosystem Behavior	JUN 25-30, 2006	Univ Calf Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA		Univ Calf Santa Cruz			In the United Kingdom, as in other regions of Europe and North America, recent decreases in surface water sulphate concentrations, due to reduced sulphur emissions, have coincided with marked increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. Since many of the compounds comprising DOC are acidic, the resulting increases in organic acidity may have the potential to offset the benefits of a decrease in mineral (sulphate) acidity. To test this, we used a triprotic model of organic acid dissociation to estimate the proportional organic acid buffering of reduced mineral acidity as measured in the 22 lakes and streams monitored by the UK Acid Waters Monitoring Network. For an average non-marine sulphate decrease of 30 mu eq l(-1) over 15 years from 1988-2003, we estimate that around 28% was counterbalanced by rising strong organic acids, 20% by rising alkalinity (partly attributable to an increase in weak organic acids), 11% by falling inorganic aluminium and 41% by falling non-marine base cations. The situation is complicated by a concurrent decrease in marine ion concentrations, and the impact this may have had on both DOC and acidity, but results clearly demonstrate that organic acid increases have substantially limited the amount of recovery from acidification (in terms of rising alkalinity and falling aluminium) that have resulted from reducing sulphur emissions. The consistency and magnitude of sulphate and organic acid changes are consistent with a causal link between the two, possibly due to the effects of changing acidity, ionic strength and aluminium concentrations on organic matter solubility. if this is the case, then organic acids can be considered effective but partial buffers to acidity change in organic soils, and this mechanism needs to be considered in assessing and modelling recovery from acidification, and in defining realistic reference conditions. However, large spatial variations in the relative magnitude of organic acid and sulphate changes, notably for low-deposition sites in northwestern areas where organic acid increases apparently exceed non-marine sulphate decreases, suggest that additional factors, such as changes in sea-salt deposition and climatic factors, may be required to explain the full magnitude of DOC increases in UK surface waters.

Drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) urgently required predictive frameworks utilizing routine monitoring water quality parameters to predict algal community density and prevent associated risks. This study investigated the long-term water quality characteristics, temporal dynamics, and algal community structure in a subtropical water reservoir Dashanhe Reservoir, and then explored the predictive performance of a Random Forest (RF) model for predicting algal community dynamics. The findings revealed that summer was the peak season for algal blooms, which impaired water quality through dissolved oxygen depletion and organic pollution. The reservoir's algal community was dominated by chlorophyta (68 %), with chlorella and cosmarium as the dominant species. Outbreaks of cosmarium were identified as the primary driver of water quality deterioration in summer. The RF model demonstrated robust capability in predicting algal density using solely routine water quality parameters one month in advance, achieving optimal performance for cosmarium. Feature importance analysis highlighted water temperature, pH, and ammonia nitrogen as key drivers of algal dynamics. This study confirmed that machine learning enabled early warning of algal density through routine monitoring data, providing both theoretical and technical frameworks for water quality management and supply security in subtropical reservoirs.

Numerical wave models, such as WAVEWATCHIII, are commonly used to predict the wave height and direction for the Great Lakes. These predictions help determine risks and threats associated with storm events. To verify the reliability and accuracy of the wave model outputs, it is essential to compare them with observed wave conditions (e.g., significant wave height), many of which come from buoys. However, in the Great Lakes, most of the buoys are retrieved before those lakes are frozen; therefore, winter wave measurements remain a gap in the Great Lakes' data. To fill the data gap, we utilize data from the Inland Water Surface Height product of the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) as complements. In this study, the data quality of ICESat-2 is evaluated by comparing with wave conditions from buoy observations in the Great Lakes. Then, we evaluate the model quality of NOAA's Great Lakes Waves-Unstructured Forecast System version 2.0 (GLWUv2) by comparing its retrospective forecast simulations for significant wave height with the significant wave height data from ICESat-2, as well as data from a drifting Spotter buoy that was experimentally deployed in the Great Lakes. The study indicates that the wave measurements obtained from ICESat-2 align closely with the in situ buoy observations, displaying a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.191 m, a scatter index (SI) of 0.46, and a correlation coefficient of 0.890. Further evaluation suggests that the GLWUv2 tends to overestimate the wave conditions in high wave events during winter. The statistics show that the RMSE in 0-0.8 m waves is 0.257 m, while the RMSE in waves higher than 1.5 m is 0.899 m.					; Li, Linfeng/NGQ-9620-2025; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/AAA-5852-2021; Henderson, Hayden/LSJ-6172-2024	Henderson, Hayden/0000-0003-1792-9548; Li, Linfeng/0009-0005-2514-4005; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/0000-0001-5466-6332														2072-4292				FEB	2024	16	4							679	10.3390/rs16040679	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16040679													WOS:001172167500001

Estimation of water quality profiles in deep lakes based on easily measurable constituents at the water surface using artificial neural networks coupled with stationary wavelet transform	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This study proposes a novel framework to accurately estimate water quality profiles in deep lakes based on parameters measured at the water surface, considering Boulder Basin of Lake Mead as a case study. Hourly-measured meteorological data were used to compute heat exchange between lake and atmosphere. Heat fluxes combined with every 6-hour measured water temperature, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen (DO) profiles, from the water surface to a depth of 100 m over a 48-month period, were used to train seven different artificial neural network-based methods for estimating water quality profiles. Effects of different factors influencing lake water quality, including lake-atmosphere interactions, wind-induced mixing, thermocline depth, winter turnover, oxygen depletion and other factors were investigated in different methods. A method employing stationary wavelet transform with a depth-progressive estimation of temperature, conductivity, and DO generated the smallest average relative errors of 0.52%, 0.22%, and 0.62%, respectively in the water column over a 48-month period. Abrupt changes in temperature, conductivity, and DO profiles due to thermal stratification, winter turnover, and oxygen hypoxia increased estimation errors. The largest errors occurred near the interface between the epilimnion and metalimnion, where vertical mixing intensity significantly decreased. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Variations in C-13 and N-15 of sedimentary OM may be closely related to past climatic conditions, which results in variations in surface runoff, lake level, allochthonous and autochthonous sources of OM, and lake productivity. Based on the interpretation of these proxies, four periods, i.e. 4370-4100, 3700-2900, 2400-2100 and 1900-900cal. a BP, are characterized by low lake level, weakened surface runoff and deteriorated status of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, whereas the periods 4100-3700, 2900-2400, 2100-1900 and 900-600cal. a BP are dominated by high lake level, strengthened surface runoff, and flourishing terrestrial and aquatic plants. A remarkable positive correlation between the C-13 values of the section and the ENSO number record obtained from the tropical Pacific implies that the impact of the ISM is greater than that of the EASM in the study area. The abnormal correspondence between the C-13 and solar activity reconstructed from Be-10 and C-14 records in GRIP ice-core occurred from 1500-800 and particularly from 4200-4000cal. a BP, suggesting that these two cool and dry intervals may be caused by stronger volcanic activities that are recorded in the GISP2 and Dome C ice-cores. This study reveals that changes in solar insolation and solar activity, as well as changes in oceanic-atmospheric circulation (e.g. the ENSO intensity) and intensive volcano eruptions may have exerted influence on late Holocene climate variability in the study area.

In particular, there is no consensus on whether the EASM rain belt reached its modern northern limit by the early Holocene. Here, we present inferred moisture variations from a multi-parameter, absolute-dated lacustrine-eolian sequence from northern China that date back to the late Pleistocene (similar to 14 ka BP or thousand years ago). We observed a sharp transition towards wet conditions at the onset of the Holocene Epoch. Maximum wet climate occurred here during similar to 11.3-8.5 ka. The climate remained predominantly wet until similar to 4.2 ka, then it became progressively drier. We observed alternating organic-rich, fine-grained lake deposits and organic-depleted, coarse-grained eolian sand layers during similar to 14-7 ka. These layers correspond to sedimentation associated with the Allerod, Younger Dryas (YD), post YD warming, pre-Boreal oscillation (PBO), early Holocene and 8.2 ka event. We interpreted the orbital scale moisture variation at our study site to the changes in insolation, assigning these abrupt and short-lived changes during the late Pleistocene-Holocene transition to a persistent teleconnection between the North Atlantic and east Asian climate zones.

Effects of Coded-Wire-Tagging on Stream-Dwelling Sea Lamprey Larvae	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The effects of coded wire tagging Sea Lamprey Petromyzon marinus larvae from a known-aged stream-dwelling population were assessed. Tagged larvae were significantly shorter on average than untagged larvae from 3 to 18 months after tagging. However, 30 months after tagging, the length distribution of tagged and untagged larvae did not differ and tagged Sea Lampreys were in better condition (i.e., higher condition factor) and more likely to have undergone metamorphosis than the untagged population. The reason why tagged larvae were more likely to metamorphose is not clear, but the increased likelihood of metamorphosis could have been a compensatory response to the period of slower growth after tagging. Slower growth after tagging was consistent across larval size-classes, so handling and displacement from quality habitat during the early part of the growing season was likely the cause rather than the tag burden. The tag effects observed in this study, if caused by displacement and handling, may be minimized in future studies if tagging is conducted during autumn after growth has concluded for the year.

This study explores the spatiotemporal characteristics of EHP over its eastern edge during the summers of 1988-2023. A trend reversal is identified: the amount, intensity and frequency of EHP all decreased during 1988-2003 but increased in 2004-2023, with the amount and frequency exhibiting significant rapid growth. These changes are linked to the co-evolution of the South Asian High (SAH) and Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH). Their joint expansion enhances EHP via favorable dynamical and thermodynamic configurations, including intensified upper-level divergence, lower-level convergence, deep ascending motion, convective instability, 500 hPa specific humidity, and moisture flux convergence. Spatially, SAH expansion primarily promotes EHP over the northeastern TP via thermodynamic processes, whereas WPSH expansion mainly intensifies EHP over the southeastern TP through dynamical forcing.					jiang, xingwen/AFK-0156-2022														0094-8276	1944-8007				SEP 28	2025	52	19							e2025GL117722	10.1029/2025GL117722	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2025GL117722													WOS:001582984200001

Peculiarities of the Structure of Zooplankton Communities in Floodplain Water Bodies of the Middle Ob	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												The zooplankton of the floodplain reservoirs of the Middle Ob, located at various distances from the main channel of the river, has been studied. It is shown that, in floodplain reservoirs, the development of the summer zooplankton complex begins simultaneously with the passage of the flood; in the summer months, the greatest species diversity and the highest biomass are noted in them. The more often a reservoir is filled with high waters, the higher the species diversity and abundance of zooplankton in it. Factors have been identified that statistically significantly determine the development of zooplankton in floodplain reservoirs: frequency of flooding, water temperature, content of organic substances, and (for a number of taxa) gas regime. It is confirmed that the zooplankton of floodplain reservoirs differs significantly from the communities of the mother river and from the lakes of the terrace above the floodplain in significant faunal diversity, increased species richness, and specific species structure.

J	Burlakova, LE; Karatayev, AY; Molloy, DP				Burlakova, LE; Karatayev, AY; Molloy, DP			Field and laboratory studies of zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) infection by the ciliate Conchophthirus acuminatus in the Republic of Belarus	JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY												This study quantifies the infection prevalence and intensity of the European, commensal, host-specific ciliate Conchophthirus acuminatus (Scuticociliatida: Conchophthiridae) in five zebra mussel populations within the Republic of Belarus. Laboratory and held experiments were also conducted to assess variables affecting infection. C. acuminatus was found in zebra mussels in all five waterbodies sampled: Naroch, Myastro, and Lukomskoe Lakes, Skema Stream, and in the Svisloch River. Prevalence was always 100%, with the exception of shallow areas (less than or equal to 0.5 m depth) in the Svisloch River. This was possibly the result of the elimination of the majority of infected zebra mussels each winter by a combination of factors, including ice scour, mallard duck predation, and fluctuating water levels. As a result, zebra mussels are not permanently present at shallow depths, and the mussels that we randomly sampled there during the summer were thus smaller (i.e., younger) and less infected than those present in deeper sections of the river. This is the first study to quantify the intensity of Conchophthirus infection in zebra mussels. When infection prevalence was 100%, it was not uncommon for zebra mussels to have 500-2,000 C. acuminatus in their mantle cavities, particularly those mussels ca. 15-30 mm in length. Zebra mussels, while relatively small bivalves, have one of the highest intensities ever reported for ciliates in the order Scuticociliatida. Infection intensity correlated directly with mussel length (range in r(2) = 0.83-0.92). Transinfection of zebra mussels with C. acuminatus was achieved both in the laboratory and held, and represented the first successful trials to initiate protozoan infection in Dreissena. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that C. acuminatus rapidly leave their dying zebra mussel hosts, and this suggested that these mussels are likely a major source for the spread of C. acuminatus infection. Field trials indicated that the presence of mussels with high intensity infections can cause an increase in the levels of infection (both prevalence and intensity) in other zebra mussels in their microhabitat.

It has also been one of the driest years, with ten months in succession being too dry. This combined heat and drought wave caused severe impacts on most freshwater ecosystems. It led to overheated water bodies and critically low water levels in many lakes and rivers, up to completely dried out riverbeds. Often, this resulted in high fish mortality. Fish-stock surveys in Baden-Wurttemberg showed a significant decline in the overall abundance of fish species. Especially the proportion of cold-adapted fishes decreased. However, in some parts, warm-adapted carp-like species became more abundant. Ongoing research will determine if fish stocks are able to recover from this record heat summer or if future weather extremes will further exacerbate the situation. To mitigate negative impacts of climate change on the local fish fauna and aquatic ecosystems, possible management measures are discussed.

J	Sun, XH; Zhao, Y; Li, Q				Sun, XiaoHong; Zhao, Yan; Li, Quan			Holocene peatland development and vegetation changes in the Zoige Basin, eastern Tibetan Plateau	SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES												Peat sediments and peatland evolution process offer abundant clues into the history of vegetation and climate changes. In order to reconstruct Holocene peatland, vegetation and climate changes on eastern Tibetan Plateau, we conducted analyses of fossil pollen, loss-on-ignition, and carbon accumulation rate on one peat core from Zoige Basin. Our results show local peatland initiated at 10.3 ka, thrived in the early-mid Holocene, and then began to degrade. Throughout the Holocene, Zoige Basin was dominated by alpine meadow. Coniferous forest on montane regions expanded for several times during 10.5-4.6 ka, and then dramatically retreated. Results of peatland property, principal component analysis on fossil pollen suggested the climate maintained warm/wet during 10-5.5 ka, and became relatively cold/dry in the late Holocene. Rapid degradation of peatland, retreat of coniferous forest and climatic drought/cooling occurred at 10.2-10, 9.7-9.5, 8.7-8.5, 7.7-7.4, 6.4-6, 5.5-5.2, 4.8-4.5, 4-3.6, 3.1-2.7, 1.4-1.2 and 0.8-0.6 ka. The long-term variations of Holocene climate and vegetation on eastern Tibetan Plateau could be attributed to changes in insolation-driven temperature and Asian Summer Monsoon intensity, while those rapid centennial changes were probably triggered by abrupt monsoon failures and temperature anomalies in the high northern latitudes.

Anne			Substrate and Topsoil Impact on Soil Water and Soil Temperature in Arctic Diamond Mine Reclamation	SOIL SYSTEMS												Soil properties in the Arctic are insufficiently explored and documented, particularly extensive monitoring of soil water and soil temperature over a period of time. Soil water and soil temperature are critical for understanding land surface and atmosphere interactions and are considered key factors for revegetation during mine reclamation. This study assessed how substrate and topsoil influenced soil temperature and soil water content at a reclaimed diamond mine in the Northwest Territories of Canada. Three substrates (crushed rock, processed kimberlite, and lake sediment) with and without topsoil were used. Mean air temperature changed little from year to year, although summer temperature showed a slightly increasing trend. Both annual and summer precipitation sharply declined over time. Soil water was influenced more by substrate than by placing 10 cm of topsoil on it. Processed kimberlite had greater water retention characteristics and water content than lake sediment and crushed rock substrates (significantly). Surface soil water content was lower with than without topsoil, suggesting that 10 cm of topsoil was not enough to influence it. Soil temperatures were not influenced by either substrate or topsoil. This study suggests processed kimberlite could be used as a substrate component for water and temperature management during reclamation of this extreme environment.

Previous research has evaluated the occurrence and non-occurrence of turnover through data analysis or simulations of dissolved oxygen and water temperature. This study implemented the three-dimensional (3D) environmental hydrodynamic model, Fantom-Refined, along with the application of buoyant particles in the Ogouchi Reservoir, to visualize individual particle movements in detail and gain insights into the turnover process. The comparison of observed water temperature data for two years with different bottom hypoxia conditions showed that the presence or absence of turnover was separated by a thermal gradient (TG) of 0.0035 degrees C m- 1. Furthermore, it was shown that strong winds exceeding 5 m s- 1 had an effect on the timing of turnover. The 3D hydrodynamic simulation showed that strong winds cause patchy positive and negative vertical velocities in the plane. The vertical velocities were several times larger than the horizontal velocities, which resulted in sharply angled descending and ascending currents. When particle tracking calculations were performed for two periods of comparable strong wind speeds, particles placed at the bottom only moved horizontally and did not ascend when TG was above the threshold. However, when TG was below the threshold, bottom particles were captured by the patchy vertical velocities, causing them to ascend to the surface before descending back to the bottom within a few hours. Although the turnover is well known, the detailed mixing structure has not been indicated by any previous studies. This study visually and statistically demonstrated the process of winter turnover through velocity calculations and particle tracking.

Relative trends of nutrients compared well with emission reductions, which were much lower for nitrogen compared to phosphorus. Despite the decreasing trends, only 35% of the lakes met the water quality standard for summer mean total-nitrogen of 2.2 mg l(-1). Based on protection against ecological deterioration or possibilities for recovery of eutrophic lakes, a promising goal is a summer mean total-nitrogen of 1.35 mg l(-1). However, atmospheric dinitrogen fixation by blue-green algae will occur in lakes with a growth limiting nitrogen concentration when sufficient phosphorus, trace metals and light energy are available. Therefore, a combined lake-specific approach of nitrogen and phosphorus emission reduction and top-down control measures may be the best strategy to combat eutrophication.																					0-08-043201-8				1998							553	557																WOS:000080859300075
J	SCHEUERMAN, PR; SCHMIDT, JP; ALEXANDER, M				SCHEUERMAN, PR; SCHMIDT, JP; ALEXANDER, M			FACTORS AFFECTING THE SURVIVAL AND GROWTH OF BACTERIA INTRODUCED INTO LAKE WATER	ARCHIVES OF MICROBIOLOGY												The populations of Pseudomonas sp. B4, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Micrococcus flavus, and Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar phaseoli declined rapidly in lake water. The initially rapid decline of the two pseudomonads and R. phaseoli was followed by a period of slow loss of viability, but viable cells of the other species were not found after 10 days. The rapid initial phase of decline was not a result of Bdellovibrio spp., bacteriophages, or toxins in the water since Bdellovibrio spp. were not present and passage of the lake water through filters that should not have removed bacteriophages or soluble toxins led to the elimination of the rapid phase of decline. The addition of 250 .mu.g of cycloheximide and 30 .mu.g of nystatin per ml eliminated viable protozoa form the lake water, and the population of Pseudomonas sp. B4 did not fall and the decline of E. coli and K. pneumoniae was delayed or slowed under these conditions. Pseudomonas sp. L2 proliferated rapidly in lake water amended with glucose, phosphate, and NH4NO3, but its numbers subsequently fell abruptly; however, in water amended with cycloheximide and nystatin, which killed indigenous protozoa, the population density was higher and the fall in numbers was delayed. Of the nutrients, the chief response was to carbon, but when glucose was added, phosphorus and nitrogen stimulated growth further. Removing other bacteria by filtering the lake water before inoculation with Pseudomonas sp. L2 suggested that competition reduced the extent of response of the pseudomonad to added nutrients. We suggest that the decline in lake water of bacteria that are resistant to starvation may be a result of protozoan grazing and that the extent of growth of introduced species may be limited by the supply of available carbon and sometimes of nitrogen and phosphorus, and by predation by indigenous protozoa.																			0302-8933	1432-072X				AUG	1988	150	4					320	325		10.1007/BF00408301	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00408301								3060035					WOS:A1988P811700002

Hydroclimatic Changes Revealed by Multiple Proxies Since the Last Glacial Maximum from the Core Monsoon Zone of India	QUATERNARY												We present multiproxy records from a 2.25-m-long lake sediment profile from central India, which suggested that between similar to 22,200 and 18,658 cal yr BP, the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) was weak, supporting open vegetation in a cool and dry climate, which is globally correlated with the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The grain size data of this phase suggest low-energy conditions, indicating a weak ISM. Environmental magnetic concentration-dependent parameters also confirm this weakened ISM. Between similar to 18,658 and 7340 cal yr BP, the ISM underwent a notable increase, and open mixed tropical deciduous forests replaced the existing vegetation under a warm and moderately humid climate. Environmental magnetic parameters and the grain size data signal a shift toward higher energy levels, in harmony with the warm and moderately humid climate during this time span. Between similar to 7340 and 1960 cal yr BP, the ISM intensity further increased, which supported open mixed tropical deciduous forests with a rise in prominent tree species under a warm and a relatively more humid climate, correlated with the global Holocene Climatic Optimum (HCO). The trends in environmental magnetic parameters and grain size data mirror this phase of climatic amelioration. From similar to 1961 cal yr BP to the present, the ISM has intensified, giving rise to dense mixed tropical deciduous forests under a warm and relatively more humid climate. Environmental magnetic parameters and the grain size data are in tandem with the palynogical findings from this phase of the ISM variability.

All fish increased in weight during the experiments, but those exposed to +2 degrees C grew significantly more than those at ambient temperature due to a stimulation of appetite. During the relatively constant temperature of the first 75 days, +2 degrees C caused a significant increase in the rates of protein synthesis and degradation in the liver of hardwater-acclimated fish, as a result of an increase in RNA translational efficiency (K-RNA) The elevated temperature also induced an increase in gill protein synthesis in softwater-acclimated fish but in this case the underlying mechanism was an increase in C-s, the capacity for protein synthesis (RNA:protein) rather than in K-RNA. The addition of 70 mu M T-Amm had no effect on protein turnover in either liver or gills of hardwater-acclimated fish. Low pH inhibited protein growth in the liver of softwater-acclimated fish at day 90 under both temperature regimes. This inhibition was effected via a decrease in protein synthesis at control temperature but via an increase in protein degradation when the fish were exposed to both low pH and +2 degrees C. From these results we conclude that a simulated global warming scenario has potentially beneficial rather than detrimental effects on protein turnover and growth of freshwater fish during winter.

A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to identify factors dominating the seasonal water quality variation from a large suite of measured data-11 physico-chemical parameters from 48 sampling sites. The results showed that three principal components explained approximately 62% of spatio-seasonal water quality variation, which are related to stratifications, pollutant loadings and resultant eutrophication, and the advective mixing process during the episodic rainfall-runoff events. A comparison was then made between YSR and an upstream freshwater reservoir (Damyang Reservoir, DYR) in the same river basin during an autumn season. It was found that the saline stratification and pollutant input from the upstream contributed to greater concentrations of nutrients and organic matter in YSR compared to DYR. In YSR, saline stratification in combination with thermal stratification was a dominant cause of the longer period (for two consecutive seasons) of hypoxic conditions at the reservoir bottom. The results presented here will help better understand the season-and geography-dependent characteristics of reservoir water quality in Asian Monsoon climate regions such as Korea.

The lake sediments in Taiwan thus potentially archive the information of typhoon events and past monsoon variability. A high-resolution multi-proxy (total carbon, mass accumulation rate of total carbon, weight percent of wood fragments, delta C-13 of the organic carbon, magnetic susceptibility, chemical weathering index) and well-dated lacustrine record from Dongyuan Lake (22 degrees 10'N, 120 degrees 50'E; 360 m above sea level) in southern Taiwan was used to reconstruct centennial to millennial timescale EASM oscillations specifically for the transition from the last deglaciation to the Early Holocene (17-9 ka BP). The temporal patterns of proxies on both timescales in our records broadly agree with those in the Greenland ice core, which shows enhanced EASM during the warm period and weakened monsoon during the cold period. Different from northern high-latitude climates, we found two phases in the Mystery Interval, opposite Bolling-Allerod (BA) trend with maximum monsoonal rainfall in the Allerod period and more gradual transition to Younger Dryas event in our record. Likely, other climate forcings beyond the North Atlantic climate jointly modulated the EASM. Changes of sea surface temperature in the western tropical Pacific also might have exerted synergistic control on EASM precipitation in Taiwan on the centennial timescale during the last deglaciation. In addition, several high sedimentation events accompanied by significant amounts of wood fragments were observed and coincide with the paleo-record of mass wasting events identified on various downstream floodplains in Taiwan. Since mass wasting processes were rainfall-driven and threshold-triggered, such coherence possibly indicated an intensification of typhoon activity during the early Holocene. More high-resolution lacustrine records are required to decipher the hydrological variation and climate dynamics that were co-influenced by the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and typhoon activity in Southeast Asia.

The stands differed in bedrock (granite in PL and mica-schist in CT) and soil chemistry, with lower base saturation (9% vs. 15%) and higher nitrogen saturation in the CT catchment. Concentrations and fluxes of ecologically important elements were measured for four years in six litter fall categories (needles, twigs, bark, lichen, cones, and "other material") at plots differing in elevation. Litter and foliage in the CT catchment had lower Ca concentrations and Ca:Al ratios, and higher N concentrations and N:Mg ratios, than in the PL catchment. These characteristics further progressed with elevation in both catchments, corresponding to higher acid and N deposition at higher elevation. As a result, concentrations of N, Al, and Fe were higher and concentrations of Ca and Mg, as well as Ca:Al and Mg:Al ratios were lower in most litter categories at high elevation (similar to 1300 m) than at low elevation (similar to 1100 m) plots.					; Svoboda, Miroslav/E-6860-2010; Kaňa, Jiří/C-4277-2014; Kopacek, Jiri/A-7373-2014; Cudlin, Pavel/G-3607-2014	Kana, Jiri/0000-0003-3596-4742; Kopacek, Jiri/0000-0002-4409-4032; Picek, Tomas/0000-0001-6264-2031; 													1239-6095	1797-2469				AUG 30	2010	15	4					413	426																WOS:000281329300003

Here, we focus on reconstructing climatic evolution over the past 1800 years from two alkaline lakes, Chagan Nuur and Sangin Dalai Nuur, in southern Inner Mongolia. With age control provided by 13 Accelerator Mass Spectrometry radiocarbon ages and Pb-210/Cs-137 dating, analyses of grain size, X-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, carbonate content, total nitrogen, total organic carbon and the stable isotopic composition of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) in sedimentary organic matter and calculation of organic carbon to nitrogen atomic ratios have been performed to investigate hydrodynamic processes, ecological conditions and corresponding lake-level fluctuations, in response to climate change. Our results show that the lake level of Changan Nuur frequently fluctuated since 546 CE, with four centennial-scale intervals of lake expansion at around 755, 1178, 1350 CE, and after 1950 CE, and one interval of lake recession from 1593 to 1782 CE. Sangin Dalai Nuur experienced mainly low-amplitude lake-level fluctuations since 212 CE, except for severe lake shrinkage from 1417 to 1872 CE. A regional comparison shows that three warm and humid intervals (640-800 CE, 1088-1288 CE, and after 1950 CE) and one cold and dry interval (1417-1872 CE) recognized from our records could correspond to the Sui-Tang Warm Period, the Medieval Climate Anomaly, the Current Warm Period and the Little Ice Age, respectively. Moreover, our results are roughly synchronous with moisture conditions revealed by proxy records from monsoonal northern China, demonstrating that the highly variable lake levels and climatic conditions in southern Inner Mongolia were controlled by centennial-scale variations in EASM over the past 1800 years.

J	Belzile, N; Lang, CY; Chen, YW; Wang, M				Belzile, Nelson; Lang, Chun-Yan; Chen, Yu-Wei; Wang, Mohui			The competitive role of organic carbon and dissolved sulfide in controlling the distribution of mercury in freshwater lake sediments	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The detailed distribution of mercury was studied in sediments and porewaters of two freshwater lakes, which were selected because of the contrasting conditions they present at their respective sediment-water interface (SWI). One lake is characterized by a SWI that remains oxic all year long whereas the other one shows a clear seasonal variation with the evolution of strongly anoxic conditions through the summer season. The results of the study clearly identify the importance of redox conditions on the geochemical behaviour of Hg at the SWI of both lakes but a very limited influence of an oxidized layer enriched in Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides at the top of the sediment of the oxic lake. In both lakes, a competitive effect on the cycling and mobility of the element was observed between natural organic matter and amorphous or organo-sulfide compounds. The proportion of Hg associated to natural organic matter in sediments showed a general increase with sediment depth. A fraction containing elemental Hg and Hg suspected to be bound to iron sulfides and organo-sulfides constituted the other major fraction of solid Hg in the sediments of both lakes. This second pool of Hg was generally larger at the top of the sediment where the production of dissolved sulfides is usually more detectable and it decreases with depth, suggesting that the metal is partially transferred from one pool being the sulfides including amorphous FeS and organo-sulfides to the organic matter pool. Methyl Hg represented less than 1% of the total Hg in sediments of both lakes. Our results obtained at different times of the summer season from two lakes contrasted by their SWI emphasize the competitive or alternating role played by dissolved and solid natural organic matter and sulfides on the fate of Hg in freshwater systems.

Sediment traps recorded As sedimentation during 1994, including a flood event in spring. Diagenetic processes were studied using porewater profiles at the sediment-water interface and in deeper sediment strata deposited in the meso-trophic lake (before 1885). Sediment cores were used to calculate the accumulation and to construct the balance of sedimentation and remobilisation. The results showed that the lake sediment acts as an efficient sink for As. Only 22% of the particulate As flux reaching the sediment surface was remobilised at the sediment-water interface. The As accumulation in the recent varved section of the eutrophic lake was 40 mg As m(-2) a(-1). Iron reduction in older sediment caused a remobilisation of 1.2 mg As m(-2) a(-1). This upward flux from the deeper sediment was quantitatively immobilised in the recent sulfidic sediments. The flood event in spring contributed about 34% of the yearly sediment load and led to distinct peak profiles of dissolved As in the porewater. This evidence for rapid remobilisation disappeared within months. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The faunistic relationship of the resident and migrant avifauna is considered and it is shown that approximately one sp. in 6 is migrant. The more arid vegetation belts support the largest numbers of migrant spp., the forest belt supporting only very few spp. Some spp. appear to overfly the most northern areas. Rather few observations of visual migration are available but those known are recorded. A summary of ringing recoveries affecting Nigeria is given and it is shown that there is clear evidence of spp. returning to the same wintering grounds each year. The status of 135 migrant spp. is briefly treated and other spp. are mentioned where negative information is valuable. Calandrella rufescens, Cyanosylvia svecica, and Emberiza hortulana, not mentioned by Bannerman (1930-53) are included and Cettia cetti is recorded from West Africa for the first time. Several spp. have had their range extended to include Nigeria. A comparison of breeding areas with the Mediterranean/Sahara crossing zones and Nigerian occurrences shows that most terrestrial spp. in Nigeria move fairly closely to the lines of longitude. Many aquatics, mostly herons and ducks, breed much to the east of the longitude of Nigeria. The unexpected number of Palaearctic migrants which winter in the arid north of Nigeria indicates that food is less scarce than the appearance of the country in the late dry season indicates. There is a great need for an ornithological and ecological research station in Nigeria in an area such as southwest Lake Chad.																			0019-1019	1474-919X					1966	108	1					84	+		10.1111/j.1474-919X.1966.tb07253.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919X.1966.tb07253.x													WOS:A19667710500006

The presence of radon in thermal and in mineral waters may result in an additional exposure to natural radiation due to both indoor radon and radon decay products present in the environmental air of spas facilities; health effects from exposure to radon in thermal spas depend mainly on radon inhalation. In fact, the European Commission has identified thermal spas as one the professional activities with higher exposure to radon. The purpose of this work was to access the concentration of radon in mineral waters from Portuguese thermal spas. A set of measurements for radon concentration levels in ground water are presented. The measurements were carried out at several locations from different thermal spas: perforation, spring, ORL (thermal inhalation therapy room) and vichy shower, between November 2013 and May 2014. Radon concentration in thermal water presented a wide range of variation, ranging between 23 Bq/L and 3601 Bq/L, which is above the European Commission recommendation value of 1000 Bq/L for drinking water (2001/928/EURATOM).

There is growing concern over the potential for climate change to promote cyanobacterial blooms, as the positive effects of increasing lake surface temperature on cyanobacterial growth are well documented in the literature; however, there is increasing evidence that cyanobacterial blooms are also being initiated and persisting in relatively cold-water temperatures (< 15 degrees C), including ice-covered conditions. In this work, we provide evidence of freshwater cold-water cyanobacterial blooms, review abiotic drivers and physiological adaptations leading to these blooms, offer a typology of these lesser-studied cold-water cyanobacterial blooms, and discuss their occurrence under changing climate conditions.

J	Saiki, MK; Monda, DP; Bellerud, BL				Saiki, MK; Monda, DP; Bellerud, BL			Lethal levels of selected water quality variables to larval and juvenile Lost River and shortnose suckers	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Resource managers hypothesize that occasional fish kills during summer-early fall in Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon, may be linked to unfavorable water quality conditions created by massive algal blooms. In a preliminary effort to address this concern, short-term (96-h-long) laboratory tests were conducted with larval and juvenile Lost River (Deltistes luxatus) and shortnose (Chasmistes brevirostris) suckers to determine the upper median lethal concentrations (LC(50)s; also referred to as median tolerance limits) for pH, un-ionized ammonia, and water temperature, and the lower LC(50)s for dissolved oxygen. The mean LC(50)s varied among species and life stages as follows: for PH, 10.30-10.39; for un-ionized ammonia, 0.48-1.06 mg litre(-1); for temperature, 30.35-31.82 degrees C; and for dissolved oxygen, 1.34-2.10 mg litre(-1). Comparisons of 95% confidence limits indicated that, on average, the 96-h LC(50)s were not significantly different from those computed for shorter exposure times (i.e., 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h). According to two-way analysis of variance, LC(50)s for the four water quality variables did not vary significantly (p > 0.05) between fish species. However, LC(50)s for PH (exposure times of 24 h and 48 h) and dissolved oxygen (exposure times of 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h) differed significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) between life stages, whereas LC(50)s for un-ionized ammonia and water temperature did not exhibit significant differences. In general, larvae were more sensitive than juveniles to high PH and low dissolved oxygen concentrations. When compared to ambient water quality conditions in Upper Klamath Lake, our results strongly suggest that near-anoxic conditions associated with the senescence phase of algal blooms are most likely to cause high mortalities of larval and juvenile suckers.

An accurate mechanistic representation of the Great Lakes thermal structure in Regional Climate Models (RCMs) is paramount to studying the climate of this region. Currently, RCMs have primarily represented the Great Lakes through coupled one-dimensional (1D) column lake models; this approach works well for small inland lakes but is unable to resolve the realistic hydrodynamics of the Great Lakes and leads to inaccurate representations of lake surface temperature (LST) that influence regional climate and weather patterns. This work overcomes this limitation by developing a fully two-way coupled modeling system using the Weather Research and Forecasting model and a three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic model. The coupled model system resolves the interactive physical processes between the atmosphere, lake, and surrounding watersheds; and validated against a range of observational data. The model is then used to investigate the potential impacts of lake-atmosphere coupling on the simulated summer LST of Lake Superior. By evaluating the difference between our two-way coupled modeling system and our observation-driven modeling system, we find that coupled-lake atmosphere dynamics can lead to a higher LST during June-September through higher net surface heat flux entering the lake in June and July and a lower net surface heat flux entering the lake in August and September. The unstratified water in June distributes the entering surface heat flux throughout the water column leading to a minor LST increase, while the stratified waters of July create a conducive thermal structure for the water surface to warm rapidly under the higher incoming surface heat flux. This research provides insight into the coupled modeling system behavior, which is critical for enhancing our predictive understanding of the Great Lakes climate system. Plain Language Summary The Laurentian Great Lakes, a tremendously large body of freshwater, have a profound effect on the regional climate. Therefore, climate simulations for the Great Lakes region, including climate projections, rely on an accurate simulation of the Great Lakes. However, traditionally, the Great Lakes within Regional Climate Models have been simulated using a one-dimensional (1D) lake model. This 1D approach leads to a poor simulation of the lake surface temperature (LST) and eventually affects the climate simulation. In this study, we introduce a newly developed regional climate modeling system that allows for a two-way exchange of information between the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and a three-dimensional (3D) model of the Great Lakes. This system is able to accurately reproduce the historical conditions of the Great Lakes. Additionally, to improve our understanding of coupled model behavior, we investigated how the two-way interaction between WRF and the lake model affects the simulation of summer LST in Lake Superior. We discovered that the two-way interaction between the models can lead to higher estimates of summer LST through changes in the surface heat fluxes.

Outdoor air PCB concentrations in three communities along the Upper Hudson River, New York	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Outdoor air polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations were measured in upstate New York as part of a nonoccupational exposure investigation. The adjacent study communities of Hudson Falls and Fort Edward contain numerous sites of current and former PCB contamination, including two capacitor-manufacturing facilities. Outdoor air PCB concentrations in the study municipalities were significantly higher than in the comparison municipality of Glens Falls. Total PCB concentrations in the study area ranged from 0.102 to 4.011 ng/m(3) (median: 0.711 ng/m(3)). For the comparison area, concentrations ranged from 0.080 to 2.366 ng/m(3) (median: 0.431 ng/m(3)). Although our sampling was not designed to identify point sources, the presence of PCB-contaminated sites in the study area likely contributed to this observed difference in concentration. While elevated relative to the comparison area, total PCB concentrations in the study area are lower than those in other communities with known PCB-contaminated sites, and similar to levels reported in other locations from the northeastern United States.

J	Wang, QH; Li, LP				Wang, Qianhao; Li, Liping			Characteristics of Strong Cooling Events in Winter of Northeast China and Their Association with 10-20 d Atmosphere Low-Frequency Oscillation	ATMOSPHERE												In the past 42 years from 1980 to 2021, 103 regional strong cooling events (RSCEs) occurred in winter in Northeast China, and the frequency has increased significantly in the past 10 years, averaging 2.45 per year. The longest (shortest) duration is 10 (2) days. The minimum temperature series in 60 events exists in 10-20 d of significant low-frequency (LF) periods. The key LF circulation systems affecting RSCEs include the Lake Balkhash-Baikal ridge, the East Asian trough (EAT), the robust Siberian high (SH) and the weaker (stronger) East Asian temperate (subtropical) jet, with the related anomaly centers moving from northwest to southeast and developing into a nearly north-south orientation. The LF wave energy of the northern branch from the Atlantic Ocean disperses to Northeast China, which excites the downstream disturbance wave train. The corresponding LF positive vorticity enhances and moves eastward, leading to the formation of deep EAT. The enhanced subsidence motion behind the EAT leads to SH strengthening. The cold advection related to the northeast cold vortex is the main thermal factor causing the local temperature to decrease. The Scandinavian Peninsula is the primary cold air source, and the Laptev Sea is the secondary one, with cold air from the former along northwest path via the West Siberian Plain and Lake Baikal, and from the latter along the northern path via the Central Siberian Plateau, both converging towards Northeast China.																				2073-4433				DEC	2024	15	12							1486	10.3390/atmos15121486	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos15121486													WOS:001384225400001

This shortcoming is due in part to the difficulty in properly sampling these regions throughout the year with adequate spatial resolution. This problem is especially critical in lakes affected by episodic acidification during the spring snowmelt, a period of substantial importance to fisheries recruitment. A device was constructed to alleviate the problems associated with conventional water quality sampling of littoral regions. Constructed of thick walled polyvinyl chloride and permanently installed in the nearshore regions of an Adirondack lake, the episodic event sampler (EES) provided finely resolved (0.25 m) temperature and water chemistry data during the spring snowmelt period (February to May) of 1989. Although the construction and installation of the sampler represented a significant investment in labour and materials, this was offset by the high quality of the data collected. As the samplers were relatively undamaged by freeze-thaw activity, it is expected that they will continue to provide excellent information for several years.

J	Hartnett, JJ				Hartnett, Justin J.			The Seasonal Snowfall Contributions of Different Snowstorm Types in Central New York State	FRONTIERS IN WATER												Located at the eastern extent of the Great Lakes snowbelt, Central New York averages some of the highest annual snowfall totals east of the Rocky Mountains. This is in large part due to the variety of snowstorms that affect the region including lake-effect storms, coastal storms, and overrunning storms. Previous estimates suggest that lake-effect snowstorms account for approximately half of the seasonal snow in the Great Lakes basin, but ignore the spatial variability that exists within the region. Therefore, this study examines the seasonal snowfall contributions of the different snowstorm types to affect Central New York. Results suggest that although lake-effect snowstorms are the dominant snowstorm type in the region, their seasonal snowfall contributions vary between 13 and 48%. Although lake-effect snowstorms produce more snow during the peak and mid-seasons, their relative contribution is greatest during the early and mid-winter seasons. Generally, higher contributions occur near the Tug Hill Plateau, with lower contributions in southern Central New York. Instead, snowfall in southern Central New York is mostly dominated by Nor'easters (16-35%), with lesser contributions from Rocky lows (14-29%). Overrunning storms that originate in Canada (e.g., Alberta clippers) and non-cyclonic storms contribute the least to seasonal snowfall totals across Central New York; however, they are often the catalyst for lake-effect snowstorms in the region, as they advect continental polar air masses that destabilize across the lake. Understanding the actual snowfall contribution from different snowstorm types is needed for future climate predictions. Since the potential trajectory of future snowfall varies according to the type of storm, climate models must accurately predict the type of storm that is producing the snow.																				2624-9375				DEC 7	2021	3								780869	10.3389/frwa.2021.780869	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2021.780869													WOS:000742598000001

Sauger and Walleye Year-Class Formation in the Lower Wisconsin River, 1987-2016	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Sauger Sander canadense and Walleye S. vitreus support important fisheries throughout much of northern North America, but their management is complicated by highly variable reproductive success from year to year. We analyzed patterns of juvenile abundance in the lower Wisconsin River, a large, lowland river in the upper Midwestern United States, to better understand the formation of strong and weak year-classes. Annual standardized fall electrofishing catches of age-0 Saugers and age-0 Walleyes fluctuated greatly from 1987 to 2016. Few significant correlations existed between catches of age-0 fish of either species and environmental and biological variables, although strong and weak year-classes were often synchronous between Walleye and Sauger. Random forest models indicatedthat age-0 Sauger catches were positively related to age-0 Walleye catches and negatively related to the CV (100SD/mean) of daily air temperatures during the growing season and catches of Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides. Age-0 Walleye catches were positively related to age-0 Sauger catches and negatively related to Largemouth Bass catches and the CV in daily river flows during the growing season. However, these models explained little of the variation in age-0 abundance over the 30years of data. Excluding the 1987 Walleye year-class, catches of age-0 Saugers and age-0 Walleyes were significantly correlated with respective catches of age-1 fish 1year later and age-2 fish 2years later, indicating that year-class strength was largely set in the first year of life and could be indexed by standardized fall electrofishing. Because a full understanding of the causes of year-class formation remains elusive, continued annual monitoring of age-0 Sauger and age-0 Walleye abundance will benefit the management of the recreational fishery of the lower Wisconsin River.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2018	38	4					842	855		10.1002/nafm.10180	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10180													WOS:000441706600007

We used P-aq (the proportion of aquatic macrophytes to the total plant community) to reflect changes in lake water level, with a higher abundance of submerged macrophytes indicating a lower water level and vice versa. The P-aq-based hydrological reconstruction agrees with various other lines of evidence, including ACL (average chain length), CPI (carbon preference index), C/N ratio and the n-alkane molecular distribution of the sediments in Tianchi Lake. The results reveal that the lake water level was relatively high during 5.7-3.2ka BP, and decreased gradually thereafter. Our paleohydrological reconstruction is consistent with existing paleoclimate reconstructions from the Loess Plateau, which suggest a humid mid-Holocene, but is asynchronous with paleoclimatic records from central China which indicate an arid mid-Holocene. Overall, our results confirm that the intensity of the rainfall delivered by the EASM (East Asian summer monsoon) is an important factor in affecting paleohydrological changes in the region and can be considered as further evidence for the development of a spatially asynchronous northern China drought and southern China flood precipitation pattern during the Holocene.					; Zhou, Aifeng/C-5881-2013; Seki, Osamu/D-1183-2012	Zhou, Aifeng/0000-0001-8349-8585; Bendle, James/0000-0002-6826-8658; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				DEC	2018	60	4					511	523		10.1007/s10933-018-0037-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-018-0037-9													WOS:000450129900004

Monitoring turbidity from above: Deploying small unoccupied aerial vehicles to image in-stream turbidity	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Small unoccupied aerial systems (sUASs) are increasingly applied to study hydrologic processes and water quality. Here, we evaluate a novel application of sUAS to stream turbidity monitoring, with the goal of extending analyses implemented with satellite remote sensing to enable high resolution, rapid collection of turbidity imagery along smaller waterbodies. To accomplish this, we collected multispectral imagery using two sUAS platforms under a range of environmental conditions along a local creek in Syracuse, NY. In addition, we collected in situ turbidity observations immediately after each flight along several transects along the creek, as well as within a clear plume created by a natural spring entering the main channel of the creek. The in situ turbidity values were compared with the mean and standard deviation of several single-band and multiband indices extracted along similar transects from the sUAS flights. On the basis of data collected across several flights, we found optical metrics obtained from multispectral imagery correlated well with in situ turbidity measurements. Though many optical metrics yielded strong relationships considering only values within the main channel, values associated with the red band were strongly related to turbidity estimates from the main channel as well as lower turbidity values observed in the spring plume. Although there are still limitations of this approach associated with variable field conditions, results from this proof of concept analysis show that sUASs offer a promising avenue for cost-effective turbidity monitoring.

The region experienced a high In-dian summer monsoon (ISM) rainfall during c.10.2-5.6 ka corresponding to the Holocene Climatic Optimum (HCO) when the lake level was high. Our study reveals that ISM weakened at c.4.3 ka with a decline in lake level, became strong between c.3.7 and 2.1 ka and then shifted towards a drier mode. However, this weakened phase was punctuated by a stable phase between c.1-0.8 ka, and a comparatively stronger phase between c.0.2-0.1 ka corresponding to the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and Little Ice Age (LIA), respectively. An eutrophication of the lake began at c.3.7 ka which was completely in-filled during c.0.2-0.1 ka. A comparison of the present results with published records suggests millennial-scale coherence in the Holocene ISM variability across the Bay of Bengal (BoB) moisture source regions while, the finer-scale incongruities are attributable to differential proxy response and dating uncertainty. Our proxy-based observations are also compared with a few palaeo-model outputs for selected time-spans [such as, 1550-1850 CE (0.4-0.1 ka), 900-1300 CE (1-0.6 ka), 2100-2000 BCE (4.1 -4 ka), and 4050-3350 BCE (6-5.3 ka)] from the Palaeo Modeling Intercomparison Project Phase 3-4 (PMIP3/PMIP4) experiments which support the assumption that changes in lake ecosystem may be strongly influenced by ISM rainfall, and the region surrounding northern BoB received higher precipitation than the other parts of India since the past 10.2 ka. The millennial-scale variations in the ISM rainfall may largely be attributed to gradual decline in orbital insolation and dynamics of Inter tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). However, centennial scale variations may be collectively triggered by forcings like NAO, ENSO and IOD.					; Biswas, Oindrila/OLP-5934-2025; ARIF, MOHAMMAD/ACR-4953-2022; Maharana, Pyarimohan/Q-4121-2018	Shekhar, Mayank/0000-0002-4245-8605; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				JAN 1	2023	609								111308	10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.111308	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.111308		NOV 2022											WOS:000915332500003
J	Beaty, MH; Parker, BC				Beaty, MH; Parker, BC			Relative importance of pico-, nano-, and microplankton to the productivity of Mountain lake, Virginia	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Studies of the relative importance of various phytoplankton size classes (pico-, nano-, micro-, and macro-) during thermal stratification at oligomesotrophic Mountain Lake, Giles County, Virginia were conducted from March through October 1994. A detailed time- and depth-series study was conducted to compare C-14-fixation rates in these phytoplankton size fractions. Data indicated that on average the microplankton were the most important size class in cell number and cell volume and contributed approximate to 95% of the total primary productivity. The picoplankton ranked second in importance constituting approximate to 5% of total primary productivity, whereas the relatively small numbers of nano- and macroplankton contributed little primary productivity. No obvious relationships were apparent among cell densities, cell volumes, and chlorophyll a values during late summer thermal stratification, possibly due to shifts in community structure at that time. The findings contrast with many other oligo- to mesotrophic ecosystems where the pico- and nanoplankton have demonstrated significantly greater importance, especially in summer.																			0018-8158					SEP 20	1996	331	1-3					121	129		10.1007/BF00025413	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00025413													WOS:A1996VR83900012
J	Shukla, A; Garg, PK				Shukla, Aparna; Garg, Purushottam Kumar			Evolution of a debris-covered glacier in the western Himalaya during the last four decades (1971-2016): A multiparametric assessment using remote sensing and field observations	GEOMORPHOLOGY												This study assesses the response of the Panchi Nala glacier, Bhaga Basin, western Himalaya to climate change by monitoring multiple glacier parameters namely, length, area, debris cover, snowline altitude (SLA), surface ice velocity (Sly), and surface elevation change (Delta h). These parameters were analysed using high-resolution satellite images (Corona KH-4B and Sentinel-2 MSI) and medium-resolution ones (Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI and Terra ASTER) acquired between 1971 and 2016, along with extensive field observations. Considering only dimensional changes, the glacier appears to have low rates of recession (4.54 +/- 2.56 m y(-1)) and deglaciation (0.11 +/- 0.04% y(-1)) over the study period (1971-2016). However, SIV and Delta h values reveal a significant slowdown (33.87%; 1992/93-2015/16), and an extensive lowering (-1.62 +/- 0.06 m y(-1); 2000-2013) on the glacier. The debris cover area and SIA also increased by 23.50 +/- 1.74% and 287.63 m, respectively, during 1971-2016. Increase in the mean winter minimum temperature, and decrease in the winter snowfall are probably the main drivers of glacier depletion. We conclude that the significant slowdown, extensive surface lowering, development of a proglacial lake and appearance of the supraglacial lakes collectively indicate a severe glacier degeneration. This forewarns that the glacier may experience an accelerated pace of wastage in the future. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

J	Cui, AN; Ma, CM; Zhao, L; Tang, LY; Jia, YL				Cui, Anning; Ma, Chunmei; Zhao, Lin; Tang, Lingyu; Jia, Yulian			Pollen records of the Little Ice Age humidity flip in the middle Yangtze River catchment	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												High-resolution precipitation reconstructions of the Little Ice Age (LIA) are fundamental for investigating the driving mechanisms behind hydroclimatic changes, which would provide reference for predicting precipitation change in the future. However, current precipitation reconstructions mainly focus on mean conditions during the whole LIA, little attention was paid to internal changes. Here, we present a high resolution precipitation reconstruction based on pollen records from the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, spanning from 1300 to 2010 CE. In this study, the LIA was defined as the period of 1300-1870 CE based on PC2 value and pollen assemblage, manifest as cold interval with internal fluctuations (early-LIA: 1300-1340 CE, mid-LIA: 1340-1720 CE and late-LIA: 1720-1870 CE). Negative PC1 value during the early-LIA and mid-LIA indicated dry condition, while positive PC1 value recorded wet late-LIA. Cold interval in the early-LIA increased effective moisture by reducing evaporation, which may contribute to high content pollen concentrations and wetland herbs pollen percentage. Dry condition in the mid-LIA probably induced by warm interval by increasing evaporation and less precipitation. During the late-LIA, high content pollen concentrations and more fine-grained sediment indicate there was standing water in the bog, which was induced by heavy precipitation and cold interval. Moisture variation recorded by PC1 value and grain size distribution indicated humidity-flip between the mid-LIA and late-LIA. This humidity-flip is also supported by the frequency of flood disasters reported in historical documents. Precipitation changes during the LIA could be associated with East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) and El Ni (n) over tildeo-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability. The dry early-LIA and mid-LIA caused by the weaker EASM and more La Ni (n) over tildea-type conditions, during which the Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) weakened and retreated northeastward, leading to less Mei-yu precipitation in the Yangtze River basin. Intensified EASM and more El Nino-type events during the late-LIA lead to longer Mei-yu season along the Yangtze River and more precipitation. 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The goal of this study is to understand how ETCs are changing within a warming climate. Historical GLR cyclone characteristics from 1959 to 2021 are examined using a storm tracking algorithm and the ERA-5 atmospheric reanalysis. Of the 886 cyclones identified, half are the large long-track cyclones that are typically included in ETC studies, and half are smaller short-track cyclones that, while not always considered in ETC studies, still have an important impact on the GLR with significant precipitation trends. While all cyclones exhibit strong interannual variability, storm trajectories appear to be migrating northward and, most notably, the cyclones are becoming warmer and wetter at a rate faster than the background climate. Winter weather patterns in the Great Lakes Region of the United States are driven by large-scale weather systems known as "extratropical cyclones." Even with a warming climate, the Great Lakes Region experiences highly variable winters, with cold-air outbreaks, extreme snowfall, and mild temperatures all possible from year to year. This study uses historical analyzed atmospheric data to identify and track extratropical cyclones that pass through the Great Lakes Region in order to understand how the cyclones have changed along with our changing climate. We find that the airmasses within the cyclones have increased in moisture and warmed up faster than the overall climate. We also find that the cyclone tracks have shifted northward, implying that the frequency of warm temperatures and heavy rainfall in the wintertime is increasing for the lower portion of the Great Lakes. Cold season extratropical cyclones that pass through the Great Lakes region are shifting to more northern tracks The number and intensity of Great Lakes cyclones do not show an increasing trend Great Lakes extratropical cyclones are warming and are increasing in moisture at a rate faster than the background climate					; Hutson, Abby/LLN-1066-2024; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/AAA-5852-2021	Glassman, Ryan/0009-0005-4303-7668; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/0000-0001-5466-6332; Hutson, Abby/0000-0001-9622-6431; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				AUG 28	2024	51	16							e2024GL109890	10.1029/2024GL109890	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024GL109890													WOS:001291191400001

The study aims to analyse the relationship between the cultural landscape and the happiness of tourists, by investigating the contribution of the tourist milieu's various components to the development of tourists' positive attitudes and perceptions concerning their quality of life. In order to assess the notion and the perceived components of the tourist milieu of Lake Balaton, a survey was carried out with 800 respondents in Hungary in 2007. Based on the behaviourist approach of geography, respondents' perceptions are critically analysed in order to identify the specific components of the Lake's milieu, especially those connected with the quality of life. Although tourism started to develop in the region already in the 19th century, and the cultural landscape around the lake has been shaped by natural as well as social forces, the study findings indicate that the perceived destination milieu of Lake Balaton is determined by attributes related to summer and hedonistic consumption reinforcing the stereotypical position of the region as a short-season summer holiday destination. Those components of the perceived tourist that substantially contribute to visitors' overall sense of happiness are also seen as influential and memorable factors in the holiday experience. Consequently, the research results suggest that the creation of idyllic surroundings by conscious development measures may significantly contribute to an overall positive perception of the destination's milieu and may also have a major impact on visitors' experience and their willingness-to-return.

J	Pigati, JS; Springer, KB				Pigati, Jeffrey S.; Springer, Kathleen B.			Hydroclimate response of spring ecosystems to a two-stageYounger Dryas event in western North America	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The Younger Dryas (YD) climate event is the preeminent example of abrupt climate change in the recent geologic past. Climate conditions during the YD were spatially complex, and high-resolution sediment cores in the North Atlantic, western Europe, and East Asia have revealed it unfolded in two distinct stages, including an initial stable climatic period between similar to 12.9 and 12.2 ka associated with a weakened Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and a second phase characterized by variable conditions until 11.7 ka as the AMOC recovered. Decades of investigations into the climate of western North America during the YD have failed to identify this stepped phenomenon. Here we present hydroclimate data from pa leospring deposits in Death Valley National Park (California, USA) that demonstrate unequivocal evidence of two-stage partitioning within the YD event. High groundwater levels supported persistent and long-lived spring ecosystems between similar to 13.0 and 12.2 ka, which were immediately replaced by alternating wet and dry environments until similar to 11.8 ka. These results establish the mid-YD climate transition extended into western North America at approximately the same time it was recorded by hydrologic systems elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere and show that even short-lived changes in the AMOC can have profound consequences for ecosystems worldwide.																			2045-2322					MAY 5	2022	12	1							7323	10.1038/s41598-022-11377-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-11377-4								35513486					WOS:000791506100008

This paper presents a remote sensing based method to observe calcite precipitation over large areas, which are an important prerequisite for a systematic monitoring and evaluation of restoration measurements. We use globally archived satellite remote sensing data for a retrospective systematic assessment of past multi-temporal calcite precipitation events. The database of this study consists of 205 data sets that comprise freely available Landsat and Sentinel 2 data acquired between 1998 and 2015 covering the Northeast German Plain. Calcite precipitation is automatically identified using the green spectra and the metric BGR area, the triangular area between the blue, green and red reflectance value. The validation is based on field measurements of CaCO3 concentrations at three selected lakes, Feldberger Haussee, Breiter Luzin and Schmaler Luzin. The classification accuracy (0.88) is highest for calcite concentrations >= 0.7 mg/L. False negative results are caused by the choice of a conservative classification threshold. False positive results can be explained by already increased calcite concentrations. We successfully transferred the developed method to 21 other hardwater lakes in Northeast Germany. The average duration of lakes with regular calcite precipitation is 37 days. The frequency of calcite precipitation reaches from single time detections up to detections nearly every year. False negative classification results and gaps in Landsat time series reduce the accuracy of frequency and duration monitoring, but in future the image density will increase by acquisitions of Sentinel-2a (and 2b). Our study tested successfully the transfer of the classification approach to Sentinel-2 images. Our study shows that 15 of the 24 lakes have at least one phase of calcite precipitation and all events occur between May and September. At the lakes Schmaler Luzin and Feldberger Haussee, we illustrated the influence of ecological restoration measures aiming at nutrient reduction in the lake water on calcite precipitation. Our study emphasizes the high variance of calcite precipitation in hardwater lakes: each lake has to be monitored individually, which is feasible using Landsat and Sentinel-2 time series.					; Heim, Birgit/B-2815-2017	Kleinschmit, Birgit/0000-0002-8494-0053; Brauer, Achim/0000-0002-6655-9451; Itzerott, Sibylle/0000-0002-4879-8838; Heim, Birgit/0000-0003-2614-9391														2073-4441				JAN	2017	9	1							15	10.3390/w9010015	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w9010015													WOS:000392939900015

Notably, the extreme drought that occurred in 2022 had profound impacts on shipping, water supply and the ecological environment of the wetlands in the Poyang Lake Delta, sparking widespread concern. Based on the historical hydrometeorological data of Poyang Lake, we used statistical models (such as Chow test, correlation analysis, etc.) to analyze the cause of the extreme drought in the Poyang Lake Delta from the perspectives of natural factors and human activity. Through correlation analysis, we found that the water level, discharge, and drought duration of the Poyang Lake Delta were all significantly affected by climate change, particularly rainfall in the Poyang Lake basin. Furthermore, combining the results of Chow test and correlation analysis, we also found that the operation of the Three Gorges Reservoir had a notable impact on the water level of the Poyang Lake Delta. Based on remote sensing images, ecological and environmental sampling monitoring, the damage inflicted by the extreme drought event on the Poyang Lake Delta was analyzed. The results show that the inundated area of the delta wetlands in the extreme-drought year (2022) decreased by 45.75% compared with that in a normal year (2017). In addition, the ecological environment of the wetlands deteriorated significantly. The water quality parameters (TN, TP, NH4+-N) increased by 50.2%, 240% and 64.7%, respectively. The concentrations of TN and TP were 3.8 mg/L and 0.17 mg/L, respectively, while the context values in the delta were 1.2 mg/L and 0.075 mg/L. The density and biomass of algae increased by 87.2% and 557.9%, respectively. In contrast, the density and biomass of benthos decreased by 59.9% and 78.5%, respectively. The control strategy for the Poyang Lake Delta under extreme drought was studied through an experiment on the operation of hydraulic controllers. The results show that under extreme drought conditions, the newly built hydraulic controllers could raise the water level of the delta from 9.1 +/- 0.7 m to 14.2 +/- 1.8 m, thus effectively solving the water cut-off problem in the four branches of the delta. Furthermore, by adjusting the distributive ratio of the main, north, middle and south branches of the delta to 50%, 4%, 24% and 22% through newly built hydraulic controllers, the water area can be increased by 56%.

In occasion of turbulence driven by the thermal convection typical of daylight hours, the pollutants mixture is diffused up to higher altitudes and then transported northwards, in the region of the lakes and preAlps, by local wind regimes of the Po Plain. Our Institute, together with operative groups belonging to local Institutions, joined the intensive measurements campaign performed in Lombardy (Italy) in the frame of the LOOP-EUROTRAC project. Moreover, in the frame of collaboration with the Department of Territory (Bellinzona, Switzerland), additional ozone measurements were performed during the last summer 1998.

Ecological and economic implications of a tropical jellyfish invader in the Gulf of Mexico	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												A large population of a previously unreported jellyfish occurred across the northern Gulf of Mexico (USA) from May through September of 2000. The jellyfish, identified as Phyllorhiza punctata by von Lendenfeld (1884), is not indigenous to the Gulf of Mexico or to the Atlantic Basin. Current theory states that this invasive species was introduced into the Atlantic from the Pacific Ocean through the Panama Canal about 45 years ago, and several confirmed reports indicated that a cryptic population may have existed in the northern Gulf since 1993. However, mesoscale hydrographic anomalies in spring 2000 may have directly transported the population from the Caribbean Sea where populations of P. punctata have been reported previously in Puerto Rico. We undertook a rapid-response sampling program from June through September to obtain ecological information regarding P. punctata in the highly productive northern Gulf waters. Jellyfish bell diameter increased by about 50% (from an average of 32 +/- 12 to 45 +/- 6 cm) as animals invaded nearshore waters during July. As the summer progressed, a net westerly distribution shift followed nearshore currents to an accumulation point near the mouth of Lake Borgne, Louisiana, in the far western Mississippi Sound. In the Lake Borgne aggregation, we estimated 5.37 x 10(6) medusae over an area of about 150 km(2). All of the medusae appeared to lack the symbiotic algae that are present in all other described populations, and therefore must have depended solely on planktivory for their nutrition. Clearance rates estimated from ambient zooplankton, gut contents and published digestion times ranged from < 1 m(3) d(-1) for adult copepods to over 90 m(3) d(-1) for fish eggs. Based on these clearance rates, the central core of this aggregation (30 km(2)) was being turned over at least once per day with even higher turn-over in very concentrated 'super-swarms'. Clogging of shrimp nets was the greatest economic impact, and perhaps contributed to millions of dollars in economic losses. The indirect effect of predation on eggs and larvae of commercially important finfish and shellfish remained intangible in the determination of economic effects. In 2001, P. punctata has recurred along southern Louisiana and has apparently spread into the coastal and lagoonal waters of the Florida east coast.																			1387-3547	1573-1464				MAR	2003	5	1-2					53	69		10.1023/A:1024046707234	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1024046707234													WOS:000209781200006

Previous research identified the toxin microcystin in blooms, but we wanted to better understand how the algal and cyanobacterial community changed throughout an open water season and how changes in community structure were related to toxin production. Therefore, we sampled one recurring bloom location throughout the entire open water season. The uniqueness of this study is the absence of urban and agricultural nutrient sources, the remote location, and the collection of samples before any visible blooms were present. Through quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), we discovered that toxin-forming cyanobacteria were present before visible blooms and toxins not previously detected in this region (anatoxin-a and saxitoxin) were present, indicating that sampling for additional toxins and sampling earlier in the season may be necessary to assess ecosystems and human health risk.					; Norland, Jack/AAQ-3863-2020	Christensen, Victoria/0000-0003-4166-7461; 													2045-2322					NOV 6	2019	9								16129	10.1038/s41598-019-52639-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-52639-y								31695119					WOS:000494636500018

This multi-proxy study focussed on subfossil chironomids but also included analyses of chemical elements using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), magnetic susceptibility, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and grain size. The chironomid assemblage is dominated by Procladius, Tanytarsus gracilentus-type and Polypedilum nubeculosum-type throughout the core. The record reveals that these chironomid taxa responded to two periods of catchment erosion between c.1700-1100 cal yr BP and c.1920 A.D. to the present. We provide evidence which suggests that the recent erosion episode is caused by human activities; however, the earlier event (c.1700-1100 cal yr BP) is likely related to increased regional precipitation, possibly linked to the strengthening of the Indian summer monsoon in the late Holocene. It is notable that the chironomids, through their varied ecologies, are able to detect the human-induced changes as well as natural climate changes, for instance, enhanced precipitation. Coupling palaeoecological studies using chironomids with more traditional catchment erosion indicators is thus a powerful tool for reconstructing past environmental and climate change.					; Chang, Jie/R-2763-2016; Langdon, Peter/B-4682-2013; Zhang, Youchi/M-6989-2016; Shulmeister, James/J-2859-2015; sun, weiwei/GQA-5041-2022; shulmeister, james/J-2859-2015	Langdon, Peter/0000-0003-2724-2643; Zhang, Enlou/0000-0002-8057-7760; shulmeister, james/0000-0001-5863-9462													0018-8158	1573-5117				APR	2018	811	1					193	206		10.1007/s10750-017-3488-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-017-3488-5													WOS:000427080900015
J	Menéndez, M				Menéndez, M			Decomposition of the common reed Phragmites australis in a Mediterranean stream pond	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												In this study the dynamics of leaf fall, decomposition and nutrient dynamics of Phragmites australis was investigated beginning in the standing position and after leaves fall into the water. The study was conducted in a pond at the end of a temporary Mediterranean stream. The results showed that the decomposition rate was higher in the standing position (0.0098 d(-1)) than after submergence of the detritus (0.0034-0.0042 d(-1)). A significant variation in leaf nutrient content was observed during the standing dead phase, increasing during the first days and decreasing afterwards. After submergence, significant effects of macroinvertebrates, mainly gastropods, were observed on the nutrient content of the detritus after 60 days. The overall decomposition rate, considering the 184 days from the beginning of the experiment with emerged leaves, in the standing position, to the end of measurements with submerged leaves, was 0.0076 d(-1). This rate is higher than values reported in the literature for R australis leaves in submerged conditions, suggesting that decomposition takes place mostly in the standing position.

The intricate temperature variations across the Tibetan Plateau (TP) add complexity to studying continental climate change during this period. Discrepancies between model-based and proxy-based reconstructions might stem from seasonal biases and environmental uncertainties in the proxies. Employing multiple proxies from a single sediment core for quantitative temperature reconstructions offers an effective method for cross-validation in terrestrial environments. Here, we present an ice-free-season temperature record for the past 15 kyr from a shallow, freshwater lake on the eastern TP, based on brGDGTs (branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers). This record shows that the Holocene Thermal Maximum lags the pollen-based July temperature recorded in the same sediment core. We conclude that the mismatch between the brGDGT-based and pollen-based temperatures is primarily the result of seasonal variations in solar irradiance. The overall pattern of temperature changes is supported by other summer temperature records, and the Younger Dryas cold event and the Bolling-Allerod warm period are also detected. A generally warm period occurred during 8-3.5 ka, followed by a cooling trend in the late Holocene. Our findings have implications for understanding the seasonal signal of brGDGTs in shallow lakes and provide critical data for confirming the occurrence of seasonal biases in different proxies from high-elevation lakes. To further investigate the significance of the brGDGTs and temperature patterns on the TP, we examined existing brGDGT-based Holocene temperature records, which interpret these compounds as indicators of mean annual or growing season temperatures. The existing and available temperature records show complicated patterns of variation, some with general warming trends throughout the Holocene, some with cooling trends, and some with a warm middle Holocene. We analyzed the possible reasons for the diverse brGDGTs records on the TP and emphasize the importance of considering lake conditions and modern investigations of brGDGTs in lacustrine systems when using brGDGTs to reconstruct paleoenvironmental conditions.

On calm days, no significant difference was found between the water quality on different sites around the lake or between the littoral and the open water. Lowering of the lake level in Lake Kinneret is associated with a major change in the nature of the bottom of the littoral zone in many sites, from rocky substrate in high lake levels (>212m below sea level) to sandy or clay in lower levels. During north-easterly storms, in winter, the concentrations of suspended solids and total phosphorus were markedly higher in leeward littoral sites compared to other regions of the littoral zone. This may be attributed to resuspension of sediments by the wave action over the soft bottom. In rainy winters, runoff, mainly Jordan River input, may locally affect the water quality and result in a north-south gradient.																			0273-1223						1993	27	7-8					363	371		10.2166/wst.1993.0571	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.1993.0571													WOS:A1993LL94300045

The compliance with these different expectations is more manageable in reservoirs with well-separated heterogeneous basins than in homogenous ones. The Kiskore Reservoir is the second largest standing water in the Carpathian Basin. Its water level is artificially regulated which creates unique habitats with high nature conservation value. Furthermore, the Reservoir is also considered as an important recreation centre in the region. It consists of four basins with different protection degree and management strategy. Here, we tested whether spatial (usage-dependent) or seasonal (time-dependent) segregations characterized the benthic diatom composition in the Reservoir. We also tested the influence of different water usage of basins using diatom metrics and diversity indices. We hypothesized that spatial heterogeneity in diatom composition will be more pronounced than seasonal ones. We also supposed that composition and diversity of diatom assemblages as well as diatom based ecological status will clearly reflect to different management strategies in the basins, whereas we expected moderate ecological status and low diversity in basins with high level of human impact. Our first hypothesis was not confirmed by the results. While diatom composition was clearly heterogeneous in time, surprisingly no usage-dependent segregation was found. Furthermore, our second hypothesis was also only partially confirmed by the results. In early summer, diversity was significantly lower in basins with higher level of human impact, than in the other basins. In late summer, however, diversity was rather directly controlled by nutrients and light not by water usage. Moreover, diatom based ecological status positively correlated to the intensity of recreation activities and negatively to protection degree. Although these results were surprising at the first time, they clearly confirm that a balanced ecological-economical relation can be maintained with properly designed and performed strategies in artificial reservoirs. But protection strategies, because of their exclusive interest to habitat conservation of macroscopic not microscopic organisms, require careful revisions.

J	McNutt, SR; Marzocchi, W				McNutt, SR; Marzocchi, W			Simultaneous earthquake swarms and eruption in Alaska, fall 1996: Statistical significance and inference of a large aseismic slip event	BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												In the fall of 1996 the Alaska Volcano Observatory recorded an unprecedented level of seismic and volcanic activity. The following were observed: (1) a swarm at Iliamna Volcano (August 1996 to mid-1997); (2) an eruption at Pavlof Volcano (September 1996 to December 1996); (3) a swarm at Martin/Mageik volcanoes (October 1996); (4) a swarm at Strandline Lake, which continued for several years (1996-1999); and (5) deformation of Mt. Peulik (inflation begins after October 1996 and ends in fall 1998), based on interpretation of interferometric synthetic aperture radar data. The number of monitored volcanic areas in 1996 was thirteen. We conducted two formal statistical tests to determine the likelihood of four of these events occurring randomly in the same time interval. The tests are based on different conceptual probabilistic models (classical and Bayesian) that embrace a wide range of realistic tectonic models. The first test considered only the areas in which swarms or eruptions occurred (7 of 13 if Strandline Lake is included; 6 of 12 otherwise), by comparing the real catalog with 10,000 synthetic catalogs under the assumption that the sites are independent. The second method is a hierarchical Bayesian model in which the probability of a swarm at each of the 13 (or 12) areas is different but the parent population is the same. We found that the likelihood of the swarms and eruption occurring nearly simultaneously by chance alone is small for a wide range of probabilistic schemes and, consequently, for different tectonic scenarios. Therefore, we conclude that the events may be related to a single process. We speculate that a widespread deformation pulse or strain transient occurred, mainly in the east half of the arc, and may be the most likely candidate for causing such nearly simultaneous events.

Fire and Herpetofaunal Diversity in the Florida Scrub Ecosystem	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												The Florida Scrub ecosystem depends on fire to sustain ecosystem function and to support resident plant and animal species. A recent study addressed the relationship between the time since last fire (TSF) and resident amphibians and reptiles in rosemary bald, one Florida Scrub habitat type. This is a parallel study in another Florida Scrub habitat type, scrubby flatwoods, at Archbold Biological Station (ABS), Lake Placid, Florida, USA. We installed 36 400-m(2) enclosures (four burn units within each of three TSF categories X 3 replicates per burn unit) at ABS. Bucket trap sampling, within and outside the enclosures, occurred during the spring and late summer in 2007 and 2008. Ten environmental variables that reflect differences in the biotic and abiotic conditions of the microhabitats associated with different TSF were surveyed. Eleven species of reptiles and six species of amphibians were captured. Three lizard species together accounted for > 95% of the reptile captures, and two toad species together accounted for > 96% of the amphibian captures. Abundance of the Florida Sand Skink (Plestiodon reynoldsi Stejneger) was highest in long-unburned areas, probably because of the accumulated litter; but abundances of the other two lizard species did not show a relationship with TSF. Differences in relative abundances of species between sampling years may be a function of the difference in rainfall. Despite substantial variation in sampling methods between this study and the previous one, the herpetofaunal composition of the two habitat types were found to be similar; differences in diversity between them was attributable mostly to differences in relative abundances. Species inhabiting the Florida Scrub ecosystem respond differently to TSF: the federally-listed Florida Scrub Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens Bosc), for example, requires more frequent burning than appears to be the case for the Florida Sand Skink. A land management plan of stochastic return intervals and spatial variation of high-intensity fires to maintain a mosaic landscape would be ideal; but management options for maintaining the diversity of all species inhabiting the Florida scrub ecosystem are limited, because of the generally small size of remaining habitat patches.

Understanding DOC dynamics during hydrological extremes (i.e., droughts and floods) helps in managing water quality, but such variability is rarely studied. Furthermore, how differences in DOC concentrations among phase-by-stages of drought/flood affect simulation performances based on hydrological features remains unclear. Here, phase-by-stages of hydrological drought (flood) were divided into intensification (rising) and recovery (falling) periods based on drought peak intensity (flood peak intensity). The long-term (1976-2019) daily discharge and weekly (biweekly) DOC concentrations from four headwater streams with different watershed sizes (from 9.97 to 119.09 ha) in south-central Ontario, Canada, were used to achieve the above aims. The results showed that (i) the average DOC concentration during intensification (rising) stage of drought (flood) was smaller (larger) than during recovery (falling). (ii) Simulations performed better when accounting for phase-by-stages of drought/flood, with reductions in mean absolute percentage error of 32.85 % and 53.59 % for drought and flood events, respectively. These results will help understand the dynamics of DOC during hydrological extremes and improve simulation performance of numerical models for water quality parameters under changing environmental conditions.

Of particular significance for lakes are severe storms that can influence biogeochemical processes and biological communities by disrupting the vertical thermal structure during periods of stratification. An exceptional storm passing over northern Germany in July 2011 provided an opportunity to assess the consequences and underlying mechanisms of such extreme events on the interplay between the physics and ecological characteristics of a deep, nutrient-poor lake. Wind speeds were among the most extreme on record. A suite of variables measured throughout the event consistently indicates that a cascade of processes pushed the clear-water lake into an exceptionally turbid state. Specifically, thermocline deepening by the storm-entrained cyanobacteria of a deep chlorophyll maximum located at about 8 m depth into the surface mixed layer. Released from light limitation, intense photosynthesis of the cyanobacteria boosted primary production, increased algal biomass, raised the pH and thus induced massive calcite precipitation to a level never observed within three decades of lake monitoring. As a consequence, water transparency dropped from 6.5 to 2.1 m, the minimum on record for 40 years, and the euphotic zone shrank by about 8 m for several weeks. These results show that cyanobacterial blooms not only are promoted by climate warming, but can also be triggered by extreme storms. Clear-water lakes developing a deep chlorophyll maximum appear to be particularly at risk in the future, if such events become more intense or frequent.

The landslide has created natural dams of Salmon Falls Creek, resulting in the development of large lakes and a potential flooding hazard. Rapid motion (cm/year-m/year) of the relatively remote landslide was first reported in 1999, but significant horizontal motion (up to 10.8 m) is demonstrated between 1990 and 1998 by measuring changes in the locations of ground control points in a time-series of images. The total (three-dimensional) motion of the landslide prior to 2002 was calculated using the horizontal (two-dimensional) velocities obtained in the image change detection study and horizontal-to-vertical ratios of motion derived for the landslide in 2003-2004 collected from a network of autonomous GPS stations. The total historical motion that was estimated using this method averages about 12 m, which is in agreement with field observations.

Because the information currently available on MIS 12 is predominantly derived from marine records, the imprint of this extreme glaciation on the terrestrial realm - and notably on terrestrial ecosystems - has remained poorly constrained. Here we present a new, centennial-scale-resolution pollen record from Lake Ohrid (Balkan Peninsula, SE Europe) augmented by pollen-based quantitative temperature and precipitation estimates. Our dataset, which spans the period from 488 to 420 ka, shows that the forest cover around Lake Ohrid decreased substantially over the course of MIS 12; this decrease was associated with a gradual lowering of winter and mean annual temperatures (and to a lesser extent of summer temperatures) as well as mean annual precipitation. Superimposed on this long-term development, abrupt changes in regional forest cover indicate a pronounced millennial-scale climate variability that bears strong resemblance to the interstadial and stadial events of the Last Glacial. This variability is expressed by repeated high-amplitude forest expansions and contractions around Lake Ohrid during MIS 12c and the oldest part of 12b substage (i.e., from similar to 477 to similar to 448 ka). The forest oscillations can be correlated to previously documented episodes of surface-water variability and ice-rafted debris deposition in the North Atlantic. This pattern suggests a coupling between the climatically forced treepopulation changes in SE Europe and the variability of the Atlantic Meridional Ocean Circulation during MIS 12c and partially 12b on millennial timescales. In contrast, the youngest part of MIS 12b and MIS 12a (i.e., from similar to 448 to 424 ka) lack high-amplitude forest expansions and contractions around Lake Ohrid. Comparison with sea-level reconstructions for MIS 12 suggests that millennial-scale vegetation variability in Lake Ohrid was strongest when sea level was between 30 and 100 m lower than today, whereas it was absent when sea level was lower than 100 m relative to the present.

For that purpose, two new methods (flood-fill and watershed method) are introduced and the results between the three classification approaches are compared regarding different lake size classes for a study area covering most of the Yamal Peninsula in Western Siberia. The focus is on April, the stage of maximum lake ice thickness, for the years 2016 and 2017. The results indicate that the largest lakes are likely most prone to errors by the threshold classification. The newly introduced methods seem to improve classification results. The results also show differences in fractions of ground-fast lake ice between 2016 and 2017, which might reflect differences in temperatures between the winters with severe impact on wildlife and freshwater fish resources in the region. Patterns of low backscatter responsible for the classification errors in the centre of the lakes were investigated and compared to the optical Sentinel-2 imagery of late-winter. Strong similarities between some patterns in the optical and SAR data were identified. They might be zones of thin ice, but further research is required for clarification of this phenomenon and its causes.					; Forbes, Bruce/L-4431-2013; Bartsch, Annett/G-6332-2012	Pointner, Georg/0000-0003-2539-3827; Forbes, Bruce/0000-0002-4593-5083; Bartsch, Annett/0000-0002-3737-7931													0143-1161	1366-5901				FEB 1	2019	40	3					832	858		10.1080/01431161.2018.1519281	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2018.1519281								30828705					WOS:000457763100002
J	CHAFETZ, HS; FOLK, RL				CHAFETZ, HS; FOLK, RL			TRAVERTINES - DEPOSITIONAL MORPHOLOGY AND THE BACTERIALLY CONSTRUCTED CONSTITUENTS	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY PETROLOGY												Investigation of travertine accumulations throughout central Italy and the west-central USA has shown that the carbonate is precipitated in response to both inorganic and organic processes. Individual deposits range up to 85 m thick and hundreds of square kilometers in areal extent; all of the carbonate is low-magnesium calcite. Water chemistry, temperature and morphology of the accumulation greatly influence the constituents comprising these deposits. Harsh environmental situations favor inorganic deposits; increasingly more moderate conditions result in the formation of a greater abundance of organically precipitated material. Morphological variations of travertine deposits recognized include waterfall or cascade, lake-fill, sloping mound, fan, or cone, terraced mound and fissure ridge. Gross morphology, internal stratification and constituents comprising these deposits vary systematically depending on the type of accumulation and chemistry of the waters. Bacterially precipitated calcite forms a large percentage of the carbonate in many travertine accumulations, > 90% of the framework grains comprising some of the lake-fill deposits. Bacteria are among the 1st taxa to inhabit and reproduce in harsh spring environments and produce a variety of fascinating constituents. The bacteria are primarily rods, generally 0.2 .mu.m in diameter and < 1.0 .mu.m in length. The rods readily decay resulting in calcite crystals loaded with micropores. The basic building block of bacterially constructed travertine is a clump of bacteria averaging 20 .mu.m in diameter enclosed in a single crystal of calcite. Aggregates of these crystals produce a variety of deposits including crudely laminated carbonate mud, finely laminated layers of mud, intraclasts, foam rock and shrubs. The shrubs are most striking, commonly forming layers 1-3 cm thick but also producing bacterial pisoids. At some locales, bacterial stromatolites composed of layers of shrubs alternating with finely laminated layers of bacterial mud comprise essentially the entire deposit. The shrub layers are the result of flourishing summer growth of bacteria and, furthermore, show remarkable daily laminae 0.1-0.5 mm thick. The importance of bacteria in the formation of travertine and their universally recognized abundance in modern sediments provides an impetus for a reexamination of the role of bacteria in the origin of other types of ancient deposits.																			0022-4472						1984	54	1					289	316																WOS:A1984SK83200025

Fossil diatom assemblages were investigated from an 11,000-year lake sediment core from a deep, alpine lake (Lugu Hu) in southwest China, an area strongly influenced by the southwest (or the Indian) summer monsoon. Changes in diatom assemblage composition, notably the abundance of the two dominant planktonic species, Cyclotella rhomboideo-elliptica and Cyclostephanos dubius, reflect the effects of climate variability on nutrient dynamics, mediated via thermal stratification (internal nutrient cycling) and catchment vegetation processes. Statistical analyses of the climate diatom interactions highlight the strong effect of changing orbitally-induced solar radiation during the Holocene, presumably via its effect on the lake's thermal budget. In a partial redundancy analysis, climate (solar insolation) and proxies reflecting catchment process (pollen percentages, C/N ratio) were the most important drivers of diatom ecological change, showing the strong effects of climate catchment vegetation interactions on lake functioning. This diatom record reflects long-term ontogeny of the lake-catchment ecosystem and suggests that climatic changes (both temperature and precipitation) impact lake ecology indirectly through shifts in thermal stratification and catchment nutrient exports.

Several sub-groups with internally consistent solutions indicate activity on several fault segments and faults. From the estimated moment-tensors and depths of the main shocks and from the aftershock distribution we deduce that both main shocks occurred on an east-dipping normal fault, possibly related to the Lake of the Woods fault system. Rotation of T-axes between the two main shocks is consistent with the two dominant trends of the aftershocks and mapped faults. We propose that a change in fault strike acted as temporary barrier separating the rupture of the main shocks. Empirical Green's function analysis shows that the first main event had a longer rupture duration (half-duration 1.7 s) than the second (1.2 s). In December, vigorous shallow activity commenced near Klamath Lake's western shore, 5-10 km east of the primary aftershock zone. It appears a M(w)=5.5 aftershock occurring the day before, though within the primary aftershock zone, triggered the activity.

Rheophilic communities of macrobenthos of the southwestern Kola Peninsula	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												The fauna and diversity of macrozoobenthos communities in watercourses of the Khibiny tundras, the surrounding plains, and the Kandalaksha Coast of the White Sea (Murmansk oblast) are described from materials collected by the authors. A checklist of 110 recorded taxa is given, with larvae of Diptera, Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, and Plecoptera prevailing. A total of 21 types of macrozoobenthos communities are described and subdivided into two parallel series: cold mountain reaches (11 types) and relatively warm plain reaches (10 types). The boundary between them is marked by summer water temperatures of 12-14A degrees C and usually associated with flowing lakes passing through the watercourses in foothill areas. Changes in bottom communities along the longitudinal profile of watercourses of the region are considered; the main factor here is also the summer water temperature, but the basic assumptions of Vannote's river continuum concept or Illies's longitudinal watercourse zonality concept are not met. The fauna of the plain part of the water-courses of the region is similar to those of other regions of Eastern Europe, from the south to Moscow oblast, but the mountain series with its peculiar and strongly depleted fauna deserves recognition as a separate zoogeographic province.

Among the different reasons suggested to explain these sociocultural changes, the hypothesis of global climate change in Central Asia at the beginning of the 4th millennium BP has been emphasized by different scholars. In this paper, I will examine current paleo-environmental data in relation with the climate evolution during the Mid- and Late Holocene. A critical assessment of the hypothesis of climatic change in Central Asia at the beginning of the 4th millennium BP allows to stimulate the discussion anew. I argue that the present data do not support a drastic climate change during the first half of the 4th millennium BP as a responsible factor for the fall of the Oxus civilization, although local environmental modifications should also not be underestimated and further investigated in a more integrated perspective of co-evolution of the ecological environment and the human societies.

Avifaunal population expresses distinct seasonal variation in this Jheel. Total 33 species belonging to 8 families and 23 genera were recorded which were categorized as resident, resident migratory and migratory birds. The population density of total avifauna was found to be maximum in winter. Family Anhingidae, Phalacrocoracidae and Ardeidae showed premonsoon maxima at all sites (S(1), S(2) and S(3)) of Jheel. The abundance of family Rallidae and Anatidae was higher in winter whereas Jacanidae density expressed highest density in monsoon period. Higher values of Shannon-Wiener index of diversity and Margalef's species richness of avifauna were recorded in Santragachi Jheel. Highest value of avifaunal index of similarity was observed between S(1) and S(3) site of Santragachi Jheel. Bird's abundance is remarkably related with various physico-chemical parameters of water, macrophytes, macroinvertebrates and other physical factors of Jheel. Total avifaunal abundance was found to be positively influenced by dissolved oxygen (DO) and NO(3) in Jheel. Family Ardeidae has positive correlation with temperature of water (WT). Anatidae has expressed positive relationship with NO(3). Ardeidae has strong positive correlation with free floating type of macrophytes. Jacanidae family was positively influenced by total macrophytes (T-MACP) and free floating (FF) type of macrophytes. Total avifaunal population has been positively correlated with total macroinvertebrate abundance. Family Rallidae and Anatidae project positive correlation with crustacean population in the Jheel. Anatidae has positive correlation with Diptera and Gastropoda family. The population of the birds fluctuated seasonally between stations to station. A remarkable interrelationship was established between avifaunal density and trophic characteristics, especially phosphate content in Santragachi Jheel.																			0324-0770					DEC	2010	62	3					277	300																WOS:000287120900005

However, some factors could affect Rb/Sr ratios, causing misinterpretation and limiting its application. In this study, we present a high-resolution XRF core-scanned Rb/Sr record of core ZB13-C1 from the Zoige Basin in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. To validate its application, we correlated this record with the chemical index of alteration (CIA) and other paleoclimatic proxies. Our results showed that (1) the core-scanned Rb/Sr ratios and CIA were reliable proxies of chemical weathering intensity in fine-grained sedimentary sequences; (2) the low values of core-scanned Rb/Sr ratios and CIA were significantly correlated with high total organic carbon content, arboreal pollen content, carbonate content, and C/N ratios, confirming its reliability as a proxy for the Asian summer monsoon intensity; (3) the core-scanned Rb/Sr ratios at core depths of 25-0.3 and 56-17 m were unable to reliably reflect chemical weathering intensity due to both the grain-size effect and the low test accuracy. Our study highlights the need for mutual verification of multiple indicators before accurately applying Rb/Sr as a paleoclimatic proxy in other similar study areas.					; LI, QUAN/MGW-3061-2025; Zhao, Yan/B-1785-2014; Ren, WeiHe/AAQ-4200-2020; Cui, Qiaoyu/G-7801-2014	Yang, Hanfei/0000-0002-2458-4544; 													1674-7313	1869-1897				JAN	2021	64	1					80	95		10.1007/s11430-020-9667-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11430-020-9667-7		OCT 2020											WOS:000579707300002

Summer daily dynamics of the vertical structure of atmospheric aerosol over Baikal coastal area from ground-based lidar measurements	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The spatial structure of atmospheric aerosol over Baikal in summer is studied on a regular basis with the use of ground-based LOSA-M2 lidar measurements at the Boyarsky scientific station of the Institute of Physical Material Science, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences (51.83 degrees N, 106.06 degrees E, 456 m a.s.l.), Republic of Buryatia, Russia. The lake is located in a basin surrounded by mountain ranges on all side; its water volume is large. The lidar data are analysed along with the regional meteorological situation and meteorological parameters of the atmosphere. The daily dynamics of aerosol distribution over the atmospheric is examined for the period from 2015 to 2023 accounting the effect of different air masses in the region. Three main typical air circulation types are identified for the coastal zone of southern Baikal in summer, which determine the atmospheric aerosol generation and transport. The first and most common type relates to breeze circulation, where the main changes in the spatial structure of aerosol occur in the 2-3-km layer and are determined by changes in the transport direction within a breeze cell during the day. The main feature of this type is a decrease in the altitude of an air layer which contains most of aerosol in the lower atmosphere up to 1 km. The second type refers to southwestern transport under the presence of an anticyclone over the region. The maximal altitude of the aerosol layers attains 7 km in this case. The most complex and dynamic changes in the daily spatial structure of atmospheric aerosol occurred under transport of cyclones and associated atmospheric fronts over Lake Baikal. Under this third type, the altitude of the aerosol layers decreases throughout the day within the altitude range from the surface to 3-4 km.

Neural correlates of implicit and explicit combinatorial semantic processing	NEUROIMAGE												Language consists of sequences of words, but comprehending phrases involves more than concatenating meanings. A boat house is a shelter for boats, whereas a summer house is a house used during summer, and a ghost house is typically uninhabited Little is known about the brain bases of combinatorial semantic processes We performed two fMRI experiments using familiar, highly meaningful phrases (LAKE HOUSE) and unfamiliar phrases with minimal meaning created by reversing the word order of the familiar Items (House LAKE) The first experiment used a 1-back matching task to assess implicit semantic processing, and the second used a classification task to engage explicit semantic processing These conditions required processing of the same words, but with more effective combinatorial processing in the meaningful condition. The contrast of meaningful versus reversed phrases revealed activation primarily during the classification task, to a greater extent in the right hemisphere, including right angular gyrus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and bilateral posterior cingulate/precuneus, areas previously implicated in semantic processing Positive correlations of fMRI signal with lexical (word-level) frequency occurred exclusively with the 1-back task and to a greater spatial extent on the left, including left posterior middle temporal gyrus and bilateral parahippocampus These results reveal strong effects of task demands on engagement of lexical versus combinatorial processing and suggest a hemispheric dissociation between these levels of semantic representation (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved					; Binder, Jeff/CAJ-3303-2022; Graves, William/B-6118-2011	Graves, William/0000-0003-1590-2667; Desai, Rutvik/0000-0002-7937-5109; Conant, Lisa/0000-0002-5050-3437; Binder, Jeffrey/0000-0002-2233-5640; 													1053-8119					NOV 1	2010	53	2					638	646		10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.06.055	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.06.055								20600969					WOS:000281688000028

Adult D. bugensis samples were collected from three harbours of Lake Balaton (Hungary) characterized by moderate shipping activity, and as reference site, from a highly protected remote area of the lake. Biomarkers of exposure (metallothioneins (MTs), ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase (EROD)), oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation (LPO), DNA strand breaks (DNAsb)) and possible endocrine disruption (vitellogenin-like proteins (VTG)) were analysed in whole-tissue homogenates of differently sized groups of mussels in relation to environmental parameters and priority pollutants (heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). Integrated biomarker response (IBR) indices were calculated for biomarker responses gained through in situ measurements to signalize critical sites and to better distinguish natural tendencies from biological effects of contaminants. Biomarker responses showed close positive correlation in case of MT, EROD, LPO, and DNAsb and negative correlation with VTG levels with mussel shell length in autumn, when higher levels of biomarkers appeared, possibly due to natural lifecycle changes of animals.

Based on eight calibrated AMS radiocarbon dates, the sediment record covers the last similar to 11,500 years and was divided into four lithostratigraphic units (A to D) reflecting different thermokarst stages. Thermokarst initiation at the study area began similar to 11.5 cal ka BP. From similar to 11.5 to 10.0 cal ka BP, lake sediments of unit A started to accumulate in an initial lake basin created by melt-out of massive ground ice and thaw subsidence. Between 10.0 and 7.0 cal ka BP (unit B) the lake basin expanded in size and depth, attributed to talik formation during the Holocene thermal maximum. Higher-than-modern summer air temperatures led to increased lake productivity and widespread terrain disturbances in the lake's catchment. Thermokarst lake development between 7.0 and 1.8 cal ka BP (unit C) was characterized by a dynamic equilibrium, where lake basin and talik steadily expanded into ambient ice-rich terrain through shoreline erosion. Once lakes become deeper than the maximum winter lake ice thickness, thermokarst lake sediments show a great preservation potential. However, site-specific geomorphic factors such as episodic bank-shore erosion or sudden drainage through thermo-erosional valleys or coastal erosion breaching lake basins can disrupt continuous deposition. A hiatus in the record from 1.8 to 0.9 cal ka BP in Lake Herschel likely resulted from lake drainage or allochthonous slumping due to collapsing shore lines before continuous sedimentation of unit D recommenced during the last 900 years.

Modeling the subsurface thermal impact of Arctic thaw lakes in a warming climate	COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES												Warming air temperatures in the Arctic are modifying the rates of thermokarst processes along Alaska's Arctic Coastal Plain. The Arctic Coastal Plain is dominated by thaw lakes. These kilometer-scale lakes are the most visible surface features in the region, and they provide important habitats for migratory birds. The lakes are formed by thermokarst processes, and are therefore susceptible to change as warming continues. We present a 1D numerical model of permafrost and subsidence processes in order to investigate the subsurface thermal impact of thaw lakes of various depths, and to evaluate how this impact might change in a warming climate. Currently, most thaw lakes in the region are shallow (< similar to 2 m deep), freeze to their base each winter, and are not underlain by permanently unfrozen ground (taliks). Field observations indicate that these shallow lakes have not greatly altered the thermal structure of the subsurface. Our model suggests that under a warming scenario, the number of lakes that do not freeze to their base during the winter, and are therefore underlain by taliks, will increase. Such changes could substantially alter the hydrology of the Arctic Coastal Plain. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

These are generally considered during the design, construction, and maintenance periods of the embankment. In this study, combined laboratory test methods and a computational approach were applied to assess the effect of groundwater level changes on the railway embankment. The Plackett-Burman (PBD), Box-Behnken design response surface methodology (BBD-RSM), and an artificial neural network (ANN) were used to predict the behavior of the embankment soil hydromechanical properties to determine the integrity of the embankment as water level fluctuates under varied seasonal conditions. The results show that the seepage line is concave during the rising water level (RWL) period, and the railway slope's static stability factor surges and then stabilizes. Further analysis found that the slope's stability is largely affected by some of the hydromechanical properties of the soil embankment material, such as the internal friction angle (phi), soil density (rho s), and cohesion (c). The second-order interaction factors c x s, x s, and s2 also affect the stability factor. It was observed that the four most sensitive parameters under both falling water level (FWL) and RWL conditions are phi, rho s, c, and rate of fall/rise in water level (H). The statistical evaluation of the RSM model produced R2 values of 0.99(99) and 0.99, with MREs of 0.01 and 0.24 under both RWL and FWL conditions, respectively, while for ANN, they produced R2 values of 0.99(99) and 0.99(98), with MRE values of 0.02 and 0.21, respectively. This study demonstrates that RSM and ANN performed well under these conditions and enhanced accuracy, efficiency, iterations, trial times, and cost-effectiveness compared to full laboratory experimental procedures.

J	MOORE, JW				MOORE, JW			FACTORS INFLUENCING THE SPECIES COMPOSITION, DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF BENTHIC INVERTEBRATES IN THE PROFUNDAL ZONE OF A EUTROPHIC NORTHERN LAKE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Factors influencing the species composition, distribution and abundance of benthic invertebrates were determined in a eutrophic subarctic lake from April 1978-April 1979. Collections were made at 5 stations located at depths of 4-13 m. The largest populations of up to 5 .times. 103 animals m-2 were found in the deepest part of the lake. Of the 24 spp. recorded in this area, the chironomids Procladius denticulatus, Dicrotendipes modestus, Chironomus decorus and Glyptotendipes barbipes were most common. The strong development of benthos in the profundal zone was attributed to a consistently large supply of food and warm (4.degree. C) winter temperatures on bottom. Slightly smaller populations (up to 4 .times. 103 animals, m-2), composed of 19-23 spp., occurred in shallower water, a reflection of lower (1.5.degree. C) winter temperatures. In the anoxic northern part of the lake, only 4-8 spp. were found in low numbers (400-1000 animals m-2). This was likely due to low (< 5% saturation) O2 levels in water and high organic content (18.5%) of the sediments.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1981	83	3					505	510		10.1007/BF02187047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02187047													WOS:A1981MG88200017

We found that the latent heat flux (LE) had a marked one-peak seasonal change in both years that differed from the diurnal course and lacked a sinusoidal dynamic common in terrestrial ecosystems. Daily mean LE was 4.8 +/- 0.1 and 4.3 +/- 0.2 MJ m(-2) d(-1) in Year 1 and Year 2, respectively. The sensible heat flux (H) remained much lower than the LE, with a daily mean of 0.9 +/- 0.1 and 1.1 +/- 0.1 MJ m(-2) d(-1) in Year 1 and Year 2, respectively. As a result, the Bowen ratio was <1 during most of the 2 year period, with the lowest summer value at 0.14. The vapor pressure deficit explained 35% of the variation in half hourly LE, while the temperature difference between the water surface and air explained 65% of the variation in half hourly H. Western Lake Erie acted as a small carbon sink holding -19.0 +/- 5.4 and -40.2 +/- 13.3 g C m(-2) in the first and second summers (May-September) but as an annual source of 77.7 +/- 18.6 and 49.5 +/- 17.9 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in Year 1 and Year 2, respectively. The CO2 flux (F-CO2) rate varied from -0.45 g Cm-2 d(-1) to 0.98 g Cm-2 d(-1). Similar to LE, F-CO2 had noticeable diurnal changes during the months that had high chlorophyll a months but not during other months. A significantly negative correlation (P < 0.05) was found between F-CO2 and chlorophyll a on monthly fluxes. Three gap-filling methods, including marginal distribution sampling, mean diurnal variation, and monthly mean, were quantitatively assessed, yielding an uncertainty of 4%, 6%, and 10% in LE, H, and F-CO2, respectively.

Diatom analysis of Lake Dojran (Republic of Macedonia/Greece) provides a new insight into lake levels and trophic status during the Lateglacial and Holocene periods in the northeastern Mediterranean. Following a very shallow or even desiccated state at the core base at ca. 12,500 cal yr BP, indicated by sedimentological and hydro-acoustic data, diatoms indicate lake infilling, from a shallow state with abundant benthos to a plankton-dominated relatively high lake level and eutrophic state thereafter. Diatom-inferred shallowing between ca. 12,400-12,000 cal yr BP and a very low lake level and eutrophic, oligosaline state between ca. 12,000-11,500 cal yr BP provide strong evidence for Younger Dryas aridity. The earliest Holocene (ca. 11,500-10,700 cal yr BP) was characterised by a high lake level, followed by a lake-level reduction and increased trophic level between ca. 10,700-8,500 cal yr BP. The lake was relatively deep and exhibited peak Holocene trophic level between ca. 8,500-3,000 cal yr BP, becoming shallow thereafter. The diatom data provide more robust evidence and strengthen previous lake-level interpretation based on sedimentological and geochemical data during the earliest, mid and late Holocene, and also clarify previous uncertainty in interpretation of Lateglacial and early-Holocene lake-level change. Our results are also important in disentangling regional climate effects from local catchment dynamics during the Holocene, and to this end we exploit extant regional palynological evidence for vegetation change in the highlands and lowlands. The importance of seasonality in driving Holocene climate change is assessed by reference to the summer and winter latitudinal temperature gradient (LTG) model of Davis and Brewer (2009). We suggest that increased precipitation drove the high lake level during the earliest Holocene. The early-Holocene low lake level and relatively high trophic state may result climatically from high seasonality of precipitation and locally from limited, nutrient-rich catchment runoff. We argue that the mid-Holocene relatively deep and eutrophic state was driven mainly by local vegetation succession and associated changes in catchment processes, rather than showing a close relationship to climate change. The late-Holocene shallow state may have been influenced by a temperature-induced increase in evaporative concentration, but was coupled with clear evidence for intensified human impact. This study improves understanding of Lateglacial and Holocene climate change in the northeastern Mediterranean, suggests the important role of the LTG on moisture availability during the Holocene, and clarifies the influence of catchment processes on palaeohydrology.

The Wintertime Covariation of CO2 and Criteria Pollutants in an Urban Valley of the Western United States	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Numerous mountain valleys experience wintertime particulate pollution events, when persistent cold air pools (PCAPs) develop and inhibit atmospheric mixing, leading to the accumulation of pollutants. Here we examine the relationships between trace gases and criteria pollutants during winter in Utah's Salt Lake Valley, in an effort to better understand the roles of transport versus chemical processes during differing meteorological conditions as well as insights into how targeted reductions in greenhouse gases will impact local air quality in varying meteorological conditions. CO2 is a chemically inert gas that is coemitted during fossil fuel combustion with pollutants. Many of these coemitted pollutants are precursors that react chemically to form secondary particulate matter. Thus, CO2 can serve as a stable tracer and potentially help distinguish transport versus chemical influences on pollutants. During the winter of 2015-2016, we isolated enhancements in CO2 over baseline levels due to urban emissions (CO2ex). CO2ex was paired with similar excesses in other pollutant concentrations. These relationships were examined during different wintertime conditions and stages of pollution episodes: (a) Non-PCAP, (b) beginning, and (c) latter stages of an episode. We found that CO2ex is a good indicator of the presence of gaseous criteria pollutants and a reasonable indicator of PM2.5. Additionally, the relationships between CO2ex and criteria pollutants differ during different phases of PCAP events which provide insight into meteorological and transport processes. Lastly, we found a slight overestimation of CO:CO2 emission ratios and a considerable overestimation of NOx:CO2 by existing inventories for the Salt Lake Valley.

The daily circumferential activity of four trees at each of two sites, a riparian and an upland site, was recorded during the growing season of 1996, a year with an extreme spring flood. First cambium cell divisions occurred near June 9, followed by a distinct and sustained upward trend in the stem basal area until mid-July that reflected the earlywood formation. The strongly synchronous circumferential activity at both sites suggests no adverse flooding effect on growth of the riparian trees, which is explained by the rapid retreat of the water just before growth initiation in early June. The following month until mid-August was characterized by strong short-term fluctuations caused by alternating drought and rain periods and a slight downward trend of the basal area for six of the eight banded white-cedars. The dendrometers of two trees, the closest to the lake, showed a slight upward trend probably reflecting latewood formation. Pearson correlation with meteorological data indicated that precipitation was positively related to the daily changes in basal area of all trees except during the period of earlywood formation, which probably resulted from the high soil moisture after spring snow-melting. Mean and minimum air humidity were positively related and maximum temperature negatively related to the daily variations in stern circumference during the whole monitoring period, emphasizing the importance of the internal water status on stem size.																			1536-1098	2162-4585					2010	66	1					3	17		10.3959/2008-11.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.3959/2008-11.1													WOS:000274162400001

This study focuses on the interpretation of high-resolution (partly 0.2 cm) data from three gravity cores and the upper part of a 10.4 m long piston core, i.e., the past 4000 cal BP in terms of lake level changes, hydrological variations in the catchment area and consequently variations in monsoon strength. A wide spectrum of sedimentological, geochemical and mineralogical investigations was carried out. Results are presented for XRF core-scans, grain size distribution, XRD-measurements and SEM-image analyses. These data are complemented by an age-depth model using Pb-210 and Cs-137 analyses as well as eleven AMS-C-14-ages. This model is supported by excellent agreement between secular variations determined on one of the gravity cores to geomagnetic field models. This is a significant improvement of the chronology as most catchments of lacustrine systems on the Tibetan Plateau contain carbonates resulting in an unknown reservoir effect for radiocarbon dates. The good correlation of our record to the geomagnetic field models confirms our age-depth model and indicates only insignificant changes in the reservoir effect throughout the last 4 ka. High (summer-) monsoonal activity, i.e. moist environmental conditions, was detected in our record between approximately 4000 and 1950 cal BP as well as between 1480 and 1200 cal BP. Accordingly, lower monsoon activity prevails in periods between the two intervals and thereafter. This pattern shows a good correlation to the variability of the Indian Ocean Summer Monsoon (IOSM) as recorded in a peat bog similar to 1000 km in NE direction from Lake Nam Co. This is the first time that such a supra regional homogenous monsoon activity is shown on the Tibetan Plateau and beyond. Finally our data show a significant lake level rise after the Little Ice Age (LIA) in Lake Nam Co which is suggested to be linked to glacier melting in consequence of rising temperatures occurring on the whole Tibetan Plateau during this time.

J	Kramer, M				Kramer, M			Home range of the Florida red-bellied turtle (Pseudemys nelsoni) in a Florida spring run	COPEIA												The home range of the Florida red-bellied turtle, Pseudemys nelsoni, in a Florida spring run is described using both maximum distance over water and Ford and Krumme's (1979) technique for producing a ''composite'' home range. Ford and Krumme's (1979) technique was also used to find the probabilities of capture/relocation within the composite home range. Spatial positions in the river were based on underwater captures/relocations and basking relocations. The results from both methods suggest that individuals at this study sire use a small home range, on the order of 120 m in length, with no sex differences. These results are constrasted with those for P. floridana at the same site and with telemetry-generated data for P. nelsoni in a shallow lake in Paynes Prairie, Florida. Sympatric P. floridana appear to have larger home ranges, with a patchier distribution of nonzero capture/relocation probabilities. Estimates of the home-range areas of P. nelsoni in the lake are an order of magnitude larger than those in the run, perhaps due to more dispersed resources or the use of telemetry for relocating animals.																			0045-8511					DEC 21	1995		4					883	890		10.2307/1447036	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1447036													WOS:A1995TM63400011
J	Yu, R; Zhai, PM				Yu, Rong; Zhai, Panmao			Changes in Summer Persistent Precipitation over the Middle-Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River and Associated Atmospheric Circulation Patterns	JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH												Persistence is an important property of precipitation and its related impacts. However, changes in persistent precipitation and the possible underlying mechanisms in the context of global warming have not yet been discussed in sufficient depth. In this study, the changes in persistent precipitation in summer and related atmospheric circulation patterns over the middle-lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLRYZR)-a typical monsoon region frequently hit by consecutive rainfall events-are analyzed based on observed daily precipitation and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data from 1961 to 2019. The results reveal that persistent precipitation events (PPs) tend to happen in a more persistent way, with increased frequency and intensity in the MLRYZR region. Mechanism analyses show that persistent precipitation has happened along with simultaneous enhancement of some large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns, including the Lake Baikal blocking (BB), the Okhotsk Sea blocking (OB), and the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH). Such enhanced anomalous circulation patterns could persistently reinforce the convergence and supply of water vapor in the MLRYZR region, contributing to the increase in PPs in this region. Based on the above results, we are able to offer some new insights into the long-term changes in precipitation structure and the possible causes.

Here, we explore a novel application of carbonate clumped-isotope thermometry for estimation of paleo-elevations based on a robust correlation of altitude with modern summer lake-surface temperatures that is independent of moisture sources and recycling processes. Using shallow-lake ostracod species, we estimate a summer lake-surface temperature of ~& nbsp;20 ? for the Late Miocene Qaidam Basin of the northern TP. Paleo-elevation calculations yield basin floor estimates of ~& nbsp;3475 m (for ~& nbsp;11 Ma, based on a conventional geochronology model) or ~& nbsp;3375 m (for ~& nbsp;7.0 Ma, based on a revised geochronology model), each with an uncertainty of +/- -950 m, yielding elevations that are close to or slightly higher than the present-day elevation of the study site (~& nbsp;3200 m). This study highlights the potential of ostracod-based carbonate clumped-isotope thermometry to reconstruct paleo-elevations in hydrologically complex areas of the TP and other montane systems.

The metabolic rates of chitin were higher in more eutrophic water. Thus, the chitin turnover rate during summer was one order of magnitude greater in the hypereutrophic lake than in the mesotrophic bog. However, the steady-state oscillation of basal chitin stock averaged approximately 200 mg C m-2 in both ecosystems. The production rate of detrital chitin was higher than the decomposition rate in the mesotrophic bog.																			0305-1978						1991	19	5					371	377		10.1016/0305-1978(91)90053-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0305-1978(91)90053-3													WOS:A1991GE44400004

Solar radiation decreases parasitism in Daphnia	ECOLOGY LETTERS												Climate change and variation in atmospheric ozone are influencing the intensity of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) reaching ecosystems. Changing UVR regimes, in turn, may alter epidemics of infectious disease. This possibility hinges on the sensitivity of epidemiologically relevant traits of host and parasite to UVR. We address this issue using a planktonic system (a zooplankton host, Daphnia dentifera, and its virulent fungal parasite, Metschnikowia bicuspidata). Controlled laboratory experiments, coupled with in situ field incubations of spores, revealed that quite low levels of UVR (as well as longer wavelength light) sharply reduced the infectivity of fungal spores but did not affect host susceptibility to infection. The parasites sensitivity to solar radiation may underlie patterns in a lake survey: higher penetration of solar radiation into lakes correlated with smaller epidemics that started later in autumn (as incident sunlight declined). Thus, solar radiation, by diminishing infectivity of the parasite, may potently reduce disease.					; Duffy, Meghan/E-6867-2016	Duffy, Meghan/0000-0002-8142-0802; 													1461-023X	1461-0248				JAN	2012	15	1					47	54		10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01707.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01707.x								22034950					WOS:000297637800007

Thus, a late glacial and Holocene sediment record from Lake Heihai in the Kunlun-Pass region was investigated using ostracod and geochemical analyses. Cold and dry conditions were inferred between ca. 12.9 and 12.3 cal ka BP and higher temperatures before and afterwards. The cold spell probably corresponds to the Younger Dryas (YD) event in the North Atlantic region. Warmer and wetter conditions with highest lake levels and decreased lake-water salinity were recorded from ca. 10.8 to 7.0 cal ka BP when the summer monsoon was strengthened. The cold 8.2 cal ka BP event is not significantly recorded in the region probably due to the pre-dominance of the summer monsoon over the westerlies. A declined lake level and increased lake-water salinity as the result of cold and dry conditions are inferred from ca. 7.0 to 4.5 cal ka BP when the strengthening of the mid -latitude westerly circulation probably triggered glacier advances in the catchment. An even lower lake level existed during cold conditions with glacier advances from ca. 4.5 to 1.2 cal ka BP. The level of Lake Heihai rose again after ca. 1.2 cal ka BP due to warmer conditions, causing the retreat of glaciers and higher runoff. Our record from the Kunlun Pass region provides further evidence for the catchment-specific response of hydro -graphical systems which are partly controlled by glaciers as major water sources.

J	Goulding, HL; Prowse, TD; Bonsal, B				Goulding, Holly L.; Prowse, Terry D.; Bonsal, Barrie			Hydroclimatic controls on the occurrence of break-up and ice-jam flooding in the Mackenzie Delta, NWT, Canada	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Concern has been expressed regarding the impacts of climate change on freshwater aquatic ecosystems in arctic regions. Populated with lakes controlled by flooding from spring break-up ice jams, arctic deltas such as the Mackenzie Delta in northern Canada are particularly sensitive to changing ice break-up conditions and the hydroclimatic controls on break-up and ice-jam flooding. An understanding of these controls is necessary for assessing future climate change effects. This paper presents an assessment of hydroclimatic conditions controlling break-up over the period 1974-2006, with a focus on extreme flood events. Both the upstream driving force, capturing elements of the spring discharge hydrograph, and the downstream resistance force, describing the competence of the downstream ice cover, were quantified with reference to the Mackenzie River at Arctic Red River hydrometric station such that the contribution of each to the severity and timing of break-up could be explored. Results show that the severity of peak break-up stage is most influenced by upstream discharge and the balance between upstream and downstream melt, while timing is related to delta ice conditions and the rise of the spring hydrograph. The highest peak stage events require a rapid rise in discharge and high peak discharge. Minimal downstream melting degree-days and greater ice thickness are also important, although no relationship of these appears to control the level of backwater produced from broken ice and ice jamming effects. The pattern of rapid (protracted) upstream melt and lower (higher) intensity melt in the delta characterizes the highest (lowest) break-up events. For the most severe events, upstream forces are important in controlling discharge-driven events, while an altered hydrologic response occurring for ice-driven events was noted, meriting future examination. Finally, trends toward a longer prebreak-up melt interval, lower peak discharge, rate of rise in discharge, and ice thickness, and higher freeze-up stage were observed, with greater variability of these controls and break-up severity in the most recent decade.

Stable isotopic analysis of fossil Bison tooth enamel indicates flexible dietary ecology across Pleistocene North America	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The arrival of Bison in North America significantly affected competitive relationships among herbivores and may have played an important role in the eventual extinction of contemporaneous Pleistocene megafaunal taxa. To investigate the dietary ecology of fossil bison and examine the potential for such an ecological impact, we analyzed the stable carbon and oxygen isotope composition of Bison latifrons and Bison antiquus tooth enamel from four regions with distinct climatic settings and vegetation. Newly sampled regions include American Falls, Idaho; Diamond Valley Lake, California; Central Florida; and Snowmastodon, Colorado. The Snowmastodon site contains the highest elevation assemblage known to contain B. latifrons. We compared this new isotopic dataset to all available published isotopic data for Pleistocene Bison sp. B. latifrons and B. antiquus were found to have isotopically similar diets when recovered from the same regions. Both species of bison consumed C4 vegetation but incorporated significant proportions of C3 plants into their diets based on mean delta 13C values. Independent paleobotanical records support the interpretation that the majority of specimens exhibited mixed feeding behavior. We detected statistically significant differences in bison diets between regions that correspond to mean annual temperatures. Serial oxygen sampling indicates different degrees of seasonal variation in the meteoric waters consumed by bison in each of the newly sampled regions. Bison from Diamond Valley Lake and Snowmastodon exhibit the strongest signals of seasonal differences in vegetation consumption, while animals from American Falls and Central Florida consumed similar vegetation year-round. Our results confirm the hypothesis that Pleistocene Bison exhibited more malleable dietary and habitat requirements than previously assumed. This dietary plasticity allowed Pleistocene bison to compete with other species of the North American megafauna until their eventual replacement by the modern Bison bison.

The inferences about their relative contribution to glacier expansion are based on the ages obtained on moraines. Since the moraines suffer from poor preservation and chronological uncertainty, the present study, therefore, resorted to a near-continuous relict proglacial lake succession in order to reconstruct the continuous pattern of glacier fluctuations during Marine Isotopic Stage-2 (MIS-2). Since the AMS radiocarbon ages (both organic and inorganic matter) suffered from various complexities such as dead carbon contribution and hard water effect, the paleohydrological inferences in this study were drawn primarily based on optical ages (along with sedimentological and geochemical analysis). The proglacial lake sedimentation was modulated by the temporal changes in meltwater discharge. This is attributed to the waning and waxing of proximal valley glaciers. Evidence accrued from the lake sediment supported by the published moraine chronology suggests that valley glaciers expanded during the onset of MIS-2 and persisted until around the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The beginning of MIS-2 is marked by the onset of cooling (similar to 30 ka), which led to a marginal advance in the glaciers. Additionally, early MIS-2 was characterised by millennial-scale climatic fluctuations. For example, a short-lived increase in humidity was observed between 30.2 ka and 29.3 ka, followed by a reversal towards a drier climate between 29.3 ka and 28.1 ka. During the early part of MIS-2, glaciers were driven by the decrease in temperature, whereas the enhanced moisture contribution during mid MIS-2 was responsible for extensive glacier growth. We hypothesise that the enhanced moisture was contributed by the mid-latitude westerlies, with subordinate contribution from the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). This we attribute to the southward positioning of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during MIS-2.					; Sharma, Shubhra/AAC-5162-2019; Jena, Partha Sarathi/HNS-7989-2023; Shukla, Anil/OKR-5341-2025	Bhushan, Ravi/0000-0003-1347-5446; Sharma, Shubhra/0000-0001-6140-2386; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				SEP 15	2022	602								111164	10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.111164	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.111164		AUG 2022											WOS:000861228700001

An assessment of the mechanisms for the transfer of lead and mercury from atmospherically contaminated organic soils to lake sediments with particular reference to Scotland, UK	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												While the sediment records of upland lakes are known to be valuable natural archives of depositional changes, recent studies in the UK have shown that full basin records of trace metals are not showing the decline expected as a result of the massive reduction in emissions since the 1970s. As trends in metal deposition across Europe are known to be declining, this 'additional' trace metal input to upland lakes can only be the result of mobilisation from catchment storage. We undertook a multiple sediment core, multi-pollutant study at nine lakes across Scotland to test hypotheses that this additional input was a result of (i) a simple time-lag; (ii) catchment soil erosion; (iii) leaching with dissolved organic carbon. We constructed decadally resolved full basin inventories for Pb, Hg and spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCPs), a particulate component of flyash, at lakes with thin soils, lakes with eroded soils and lakes with non-eroded soils in their catchments to assess temporal trends. The use of both trace metals and SCPs allowed a comparison between erosive (SCPs and metals) and leaching (metals only) processes. Our results showed that the full basin inventories for Hg, Pb and SCPs for lakes with thin catchment soils had similar temporal trends to those of atmospheric emissions and deposition. For lakes with significantly eroded catchment soils, increasing trends in inventories continued to the most recent decades while those with non-eroded soils showed an intermediate pattern with some similarity to atmospheric deposition patterns, but with a reduced recent decline. We conclude that catchment soil erosion is the main transfer mechanism for trace metals at these sites and that although the leaching of metals bound to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) may play a role this appears to be less significant. The processes that lead to soil erosion and leaching of DOC from the catchment are exacerbated by increased winter rainfall, prolonged summer drought and increased frequency of high intensity rain events. Hence, predicted climatic changes will increase pollutant transfer from catchment to surface waters. The catchment storage of deposited pollutants is a massive potential reservoir that could keep fluxes of contaminants to surface waters elevated for many decades to come. This would counteract the benefits of reductions in deposition resulting from policy implementations over recent decades and may elevate exposure of aquatic biota to these contaminants.

Multi-tracer investigation of groundwater residence time in a karstic aquifer: Bitter Lakes National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico, USA	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Several natural and anthropogenic tracers have been used to evaluate groundwater residence time within a karstic limestone aquifer in southeastern New Mexico, USA. Natural groundwater discharge occurs in the lower Pecos Valley from a region of karst springs, wetlands and sinkhole lakes at Bitter Lakes National Wildlife Refuge, on the northeast margin of the Roswell Artesian Basin. The springs and sinkholes are formed in gypsum bedrock that serves as a leaky confining unit for an artesian aquifer in the underlying San Andres limestone. Because wetlands on the Refuge provide habitat for threatened and endangered species, there is concern about the potential for contamination by anthropogenic activity in the aquifer recharge area. Estimates of the time required for groundwater to travel through the artesian aquifer vary widely because of uncertainties regarding karst conduit flow. A better understanding of groundwater residence time is required to make informed decisions about management of water resources and wildlife habitat at Bitter Lakes. Results indicate that the artesian aquifer contains a significant component of water recharged within the last 10-50 years, combined with pre-modern groundwater originating from deeper underlying aquifers, some of which may be indirectly sourced from the high Sacramento Mountains to the west.																			1431-2174	1435-0157				MAR	2010	18	2					455	472		10.1007/s10040-009-0522-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-009-0522-3													WOS:000274456600015

T.; Dehghan, Armin			The Impacts of Climate Change on Land Hydroclimatology of the Laurentian Great Lakes Basin	FRONTIERS IN WATER												The freshwater resources of the Laurentian Great Lakes basin contribute significantly to the environment and economy of the region. With the impacts of climate change becoming more evident, sustainable management of the freshwater resources of the Laurentian Great Lakes basin is important. This study uses 36 simulations from 6 regional climate models to quantify trends and changes in land-area precipitation and temperature in two future periods (mid-century, 2035-2064 and end-century, 2065-2094) with reference to a baseline period (1951-2005) for two emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP 8.5). Climatic forcings from these 36 simulations are used as input to a calibrated and validated hydrological model to assess changes in land snowpack and actual evapotranspiration, and runoff to lake. Ensemble results show wetter (7 to 15% increase in annual precipitation) and warmer (2.4-5.0 degrees C increase in annual mean temperature) future conditions on GL land areas. Seasonal and monthly changes in precipitation and mean temperature are more sporadic, for instance although precipitation is projected to increase overall, in some scenarios, summer precipitation is expected to decrease. Projected increases in highest one-day precipitation and decreases in number of wet days indicate possible increases in extreme precipitation in future. Minimum temperature is expected to increase in a higher rate than maximum temperature. Ensemble results from the hydrological model show projected decrease in snowpack (29-58%). Similarly, actual evapotranspiration is projected to increase, especially during summer months (up to 0.4 mm/day). Annually, runoff is expected to increase (up to 48% in Superior, 40% in Michigan-Huron, 25% Erie and 28% in Ontario). Seasonal and monthly changes in runoff are more sporadic (e.g., projected decrease up to 17% in Erie subdomain in October). Such contrasting patterns of changes in land hydroclimatology of the GL basin will pose challenges to sustainable management of the water resources of the basin in future.																				2624-9375				JUL 11	2022	4								801134	10.3389/frwa.2022.801134	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2022.801134													WOS:000831163300001
J	Kloos, H; Haimanot, RT				Kloos, H; Haimanot, RT			Distribution of fluoride and fluorosis in Ethiopia and prospects for control	TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH												A review and mapping of fluoride rest data for 270 water sources in 126 communities and examination of the literature of fluorosis distribution in Ethiopia show that this health problem extends beyond the Rift Valley into some highland communities. Fluoride concentrations above 5.0 mg/l in the Rift Valley were found mostly in hot springs (100% of all sources), lakes (78%), shallow wells (54%) and boreholes (35%) and the lowest concentrations (below 1.5 mg/l) in springs and rivers. Analysis of hydrochemical, economic and demographic factors in the spatial distribution of high-fluoride domestic water sources indicates that the fluorosis problem has become more serious in the Rift Valley in recent decades. Considerable spatial variation in the occurrence of fluoride, even within the same communities, and the presence of some low-fluoride water sources in the Rift Valley offer possibilities for geochemical exploration for acceptable domestic sources. The defluoridation programme in the Wonji irrigation scheme illustrates the problems faced by a large rural community in a developing country. Possibilities for control are examined and recommendations made for the development of alternative water sources and promising defluoridation methods using locally available materials and technologies.																			1360-2276					MAY	1999	4	5					355	364		10.1046/j.1365-3156.1999.00405.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3156.1999.00405.x								10402971					WOS:000081240400006

Climate and nutrient enrichment were the most studied factors modulating cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic lakes. However, in many floodplain lakes, the importance of hydrological variation in driving and predicting cyanobacterial blooms is often overlooked and largely underestimated, which has hampered the effectiveness of lake management. Here, we use a process-based lake ecosystem model (GOTMWET) to evaluate the potential drivers of the record-setting cyanobacterial bloom during summer 2022 (>70% of lake area) in the largest shallow lake in Northern China (Hulun Lake). The model was calibrated based on a comprehensive field dataset including both remote sensing (surface water temperature) and in-lake observations (water quality). We performed a scenario analysis with various combinations of nutrient loading, hydrological variations and climate change. Our modeling results unravel that the profound water level rise through 2021 to 2022 serves as the main trigger of the severe cyanobacterial bloom in summer 2022. Our model predicted a decrease of 60.5% in the annual average of cyanobacterial biomass when water level remained stable. In addition, water level change and nutrient concentration explains 72.5% of the variance in long-term maximum area of cyanobacterial blooms. Our model further reveals that the water level rise drives the cyanobacterial bloom via bringing in excessive nutrient to lake water column from the lake basin. Thus, our results suggest that continuous increase in water level across two years could serve as an early warning signal to cyanobacterial blooms in the consecutive summer. Our findings may be applicable to similar temperate shallow lakes in floodplain areas, especially for those located in agricultural and pasture regions with abundant nutrient legacy, thus may provide a new indicator for cyanobacterial blooms prediction.

We carried out detailed ice-phenology mapping of arctic lakes, based on daily surface-reflectance time series for 2000-2013 from MODIS at 250 m spatial resolution. We used over 13,300 lakes, area > 1 km(2), in five study areas distributed evenly across the circumpolar Arctic the first such phenological dataset. All areas showed significant trends towards an earlier break-up, stronger than previously reported. The mean shift in break-up start ranged from -0.10 days/year (Northern Europe) to -1.05 days/year (central Siberia); the shift in break-up end was between -0.14 and -0.72 days/year. Finally, we explored the effect of temperature on break-up timing and compared results among study areas. The 0 degrees C isotherm shows the strongest relationship (r = 0.56-0.81) in all study areas. If the trend in early break-up continues, rapidly changing ice phenology will likely generate significant, arctic-wide impacts.

Distinguishing between Natural and Hatchery Snake River Fall Chinook Salmon Subyearlings in the Field Using Body Morphology	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We used body morphology to distinguish between natural- and hatchery-origin subyearling fall Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in rearing areas of the Snake River and at a downstream dam during seaward migration. Using subjective eye and body shape characteristics, field personnel correctly classified 88.9-100% of natural subyearlings (N = 626) and 90.0-100% of hatchery subyearlings (N = 867) in rearing areas from 2001 to 2008. The morphological characteristics used by these personnel proved to have a quantitative basis, as was shown by digital photography and principal components analysis. Natural subyearlings had smaller eyes and pupils, smaller heads, deeper bodies, and shorter caudal peduncles than their hatchery counterparts during rearing and at the dam. A discriminant function fitted from this set of morphological characteristics classified the origin of fish during rearing and at the dam with over 97% accuracy. We hypothesize that these morphological differences were primarily due to environmental influences during incubation and rearing because it is highly probable that a large portion of the natural juveniles we studied were the offspring of hatchery x hatchery mating in the wild. The findings in this paper might provide guidance for others seeking to differentiate between natural and hatchery fish.

Comparisons of Walleye Fecundity Before, During, and After Rehabilitation of the Red Lakes Fishery	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The Red Lakes, Minnesota supported a substantial Walleye Sander vitreus fishery from the early to mid -20th century but experienced a major crash in the late 1990s. The population has since rebounded after a successful interagency recovery program and now supports valuable commercial and recreational fisheries. The variation in population densities associated with the collapse and subsequent recovery in the Red Lakes Walleye population provides a rare opportunity to study potential changes in relative fecundity (eggs/kg of body mass) under varying rates of exploitation: overexploited (1989 data), recovering (2004 data), and recovered (2017 data). We collected female Walleye in spring of 1989 ( n = 30) from the Blackduck and Tamarac rivers and in spring of 2004 ( n = 30) and 2017 ( n = 30) from the Tamarac River. Results indicate that relative fecundity was significantly lower in 2017 (50,768, SD = 10,266) than in 1989 (58,216, SD = 6,211) and 2004 (61,964, SD = 7,472). We hypothesize that differences in relative fecundity among fishery states were due to differences in Walleye population abundances caused by varying exploitation rates in the years leading up to fecundity estimates.

J	Stelling, P; Gardner, JE; Begét, J				Stelling, P; Gardner, JE; Begét, J			Eruptive history of Fisher Caldera, Alaska, USA	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												New field, compositional, and geochronologic data from Fisher Caldera, the largest of 12 Holocene calderas in Alaska, provide insights into the eruptive history and formation of this volcanic system. Prior to the caldera-forming eruption (CFE) 9400 years ago, the volcanic system consisted of a cluster of several small (similar to3 km(3)) stratocones, which were independently active between 66 +/- 144 and 9.4 +/- 0.2 ka. Fisher Caldera formed through a single eruption, which produced a thick dacitic fall deposit and two pyroclastic-flow deposits, a small dacitic flow and a compositionally mixed basaltic-dacitic flow. Thickness and grain-size data indicate that the fall deposit was dispersed primarily to the northeast, whereas the two flows were oppositely directed to the south and north. After the cataclysmic eruption, a lake filled much of the caldera during what may have been a significant quiescent period. Volcanic activity from intracaldera vents gradually resumed, producing thick successions of scoria fall interbedded with lake sediments. Several Holocene stratocones have developed; one of which has had a major collapse event. The caldera lake catastrophically drained when a phreatomagmatic eruption generated a large wave that overtopped and incised the southwestern caldera wall. Multiple accretionary-lapilli-bearing deposits inside and outside the caldera suggest significant Holocene phreatomagmatic activity. The most recent eruptive activity from the Fisher volcanic system was a small explosive eruption in 1826, and current activity is hydrothermal. Late Pleistocene to Holocene magma eruption rates range from 0.03 to 0.09 km(3) ky(-1) km(-1), respectively. The Fisher volcanic system is chemically diverse, similar to48-72 wt.% SiO2, with at least seven dacitic eruptions over the last 82 14 ka that may have become more frequent over time. Least squares calculations suggest that prior to the CFE, Fisher Volcano products were not derived from a single, large magma reservoir, and were likely erupted from multiple, compositionally independent magma reservoirs. After the CFE, the majority of products appear to have derived from a single reservoir in which magma mixing has occurred. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

CLIMATOLOGY OF SLEET IN THE UNITED STATES	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												A climatology of sleet Occurrences in the United States was compiled using data for 1950-2001 from 232 weather stations. Sleet is one of the damaging forms of winter precipitation. The average annual frequency of sleet events has a latitudinal distribution east of the Rockies with values ranging from less than 1 day a year in the Deep South to 5 or more days in the north. The highest averages are 14-20 days in the northern plains. Sleet does not occur in the Florida peninsula, extreme southern Texas and Arizona, and most of the southern half of California. Most areas of the nation have had years with no sleet, but the annual minimum is 1 or 2 sleet days in the High Plains and New England. Sleet first occurs in September in the mountainous areas and the Great Lakes; in October over large parts of the nation; in November in the South; and in December along the Gulf Coast. Sleet is most frequent at night and least frequent in afternoon hours, and its average duration is 2-3 hours per event. The season's last sleet occurs in February along the Gulf Coast and shifts northward in April, the last month with sleet in most of the United States. January is the peak month for sleet incidences in all parts of the nation. The temporal distributions of sleet occurrences across the nation during 1950-1999 reveal three regions with distinctly different time distributions: northern region, southern region, and western region. Nationally, the 50-year distribution showed no up or down trend, but from 1965 to 1999 sleet events did increase, based largely on up trends in the Northeast, East North Central, and Central regions.																			0272-3646					MAY-JUN	2008	29	3					195	207		10.2747/0272-3646.29.3.195	http://dx.doi.org/10.2747/0272-3646.29.3.195													WOS:000260734900001

Experimental Ecosystem Eutrophication Causes Offsetting Effects on Emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from Agricultural Reservoirs	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Despite decades of research and management efforts, eutrophication remains a persistent threat to inland waters. As nutrient pollution intensifies in the coming decades, the implications for aquatic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are poorly defined, particularly the responses of individual GHGs: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). The biogeochemical controls of each gas can differ, making it difficult to predict the overall effect of nutrient pollution on the net radiative forcing of aquatic ecosystems. Here, we induced eutrophication of small nitrogen (N)-limited agricultural reservoirs and measured changes in diffusive GHG emissions within a before-after-control-impact (BACI) study design during June to September 2021. Each gas exhibited a unique response to 300% increases in primary production, with a shift from an overall CO2 source to a sink, a modest increase in N2O flux, and, unexpectedly, no significant change in CH4 emissions. The lack of net directional change in CO2-equivalent GHG emissions in fertilized reservoirs during the summer contrasts findings from empirical studies of eutrophic lakes. Our findings illustrate the difficulty in extrapolating among different sized ecosystems and suggest that forecast 2-fold increases in agricultural N fertilization by 2050 may not result in consistently elevated GHG emissions during summer, at least from small reservoirs in continental grassland regions.

Previous studies yielded inconsistent results on the intraseasonal variability (ISV) of summer rainfall in terms of periodicity, genesis process and propagation pathway over the EPT based on small samples. In this study, we detected two dominant peaks of transient ISV, centered on quasi-biweekly (12-24) days (QBW) and quasi-9 (8-11) days using daily rainfall data over the ETP during the period of 1992-2012. Composite analysis revealed that the two ISVs were predominantly associated with the non-stationary wave trains, which traveled along different pathways. For the QBW, its mid-latitude wave train featured a upper-level southeastward migration, originating in Northern Europe and traveling via the East European Plain, the Ural Mountains, Lake Balkhash-Lake Baikal, the Mongolian Plateau, and then continued southward to the ETP and South Asia; and its tropical wave train was characterized with a northwestward/northward migration in low-level, starting from the Philippine Sea (PS)-South China Sea (SCS) region, moving over northern Bay of Bengal-SCS region, and arriving over the southern fridge of TP and southern China. In contrast, for quasi-9-day, the most significant mid-latitudes variability featured an eastward propagating upper-level wave train, originating from Western Europe, passing across the Mediterranean, the Black and Caspian seas, arriving over the TP, and moving towards East Asia; and the most evident tropical variability exhibited a clear northwestward/westward migration of a low-level wave train, originating from PS, passing over Taiwan, and subsequently moving towards southeastern China. Their different spatiotemporal features of associated wave trains caused their distinct linkages with eastern China rainfall anomalies. A "meridional pattern" with a giant Ural Mountain Ridge was the most remarkable precursory signals in upstream region before the QBW wet phase occurrence, which was different from the quasi-9-day. The major processes generating the local wet spells for the two modes were commonly linked to the preceding boundary warming, the upper-level negative vorticity and low-level prevalent winds, which triggered the ascending anomaly and lower tropospheric pre-moistening. We also discussed the co-variation of the wave trains between mid-latitudes and low-latitudes. The distinct evolution related with the two ISVs over the ETP described here may provide a useful guidance for 2-3 weeks (extended range) forecasts over the ETP and its downstream regions.

When raising vessels from Puget Sound to lake level, a strong current of salt water flows from the lock chamber into the freshwater system resulting in two opposing water-management issues at the locks: salt-water intrusion and water conservation. Several physical structures are present to prevent salt water from propagating upstream with each lake-bound lockage. During heavy use in the summer period, these structures cannot keep up with the amount of seawater entering the freshwater system, and an additional flushing technique is required. Consequently, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which manages the locks, has implemented a ''miniflushing'' procedure for summer months. Miniflushing is defined as any process that can be temporarily implemented as part of a lockage to minimize salt-water intrusion. Recent field experiments at the locks compare two methods of miniflushing, and a recent improvement in procedure is discussed in this paper.																			0733-950X					JUL-AUG	1995	121	4					224	227		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-950X(1995)121:4(224)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-950X(1995)121:4(224)													WOS:A1995RE37600005

The developmental relationship between depression types, such as sinkholes (dolines) and uvalas, has been the subject of debate, mainly because the long developmental timescales in classical limestone karst settings impede direct observation. Here we characterize the morphometric properties and spatio-temporal development of similar to 1150 sinkholes and five uvalas formed from similar to 1980 to 2017 in an evaporite karst setting along the eastern coast of the hypersaline Dead Sea (at Ghor Al-Haditha, Jordan). The development of sinkhole populations and individual uvalas is intertwined in terms of onset, evolution and cessation. The sinkholes commonly develop in clusters, within which they may coalesce to form compound or nested sinkholes. In general, however, the uvalas are not defined by coalescence of sinkholes. Although each uvala usually encloses several clusters of sinkholes, it develops as a larger-scale, gentler and structurally distinct depression. The location of new sinkholes and uvalas shows a marked shoreline-parallel migration with time, followed by a marked shoreline-perpendicular (i.e. seaward) growth with time. These observations are consistent with theoretical predictions of karstification controlled by a laterally migrating interface between saturated and undersaturated groundwater, as induced by the 35 m fall in the Dead Sea water level since 1967. More generally, our observations indicate that uvalas and the sinkhole populations within them, although morphometrically distinct, can develop near-synchronously by subsidence in response to subsurface erosion.					; Walter, Thomas/AAQ-7405-2021; Siebert, Christian/D-3380-2013; Walter, Thomas/K-4857-2015; KARAKI, Najib/ABH-7526-2020; Al-Halbouni, Djamil/CAH-1363-2022	Dahm, Torsten/0000-0001-6432-7422; Al-Halbouni, Djamil/0000-0003-2254-3914; Siebert, Christian/0000-0001-7266-8112; Walter, Thomas/0000-0002-9925-4486; Watson, Robert Alban/0000-0002-7086-3237; Holohan, Eoghan/0000-0002-5930-6712; 													1869-9510	1869-9529				AUG 30	2019	10	4					1451	1468		10.5194/se-10-1451-2019	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/se-10-1451-2019													WOS:000484056500001

Sewage influent and effluent samples, as well as rainwater and road runoff samples were also analyzed as the potential sources of OPEs in surface water. Tris(2-chloro-1-methylethyl) phosphate (TCPP) and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) were the most abundant OPEs with the average concentrations of 291 ng L-1 and 219 ng L-1, respectively. Relatively high concentrations of OPEs were detected in rivers located at southern and eastern urban of Beijing, which was probably attributed to the treated and untreated sewage discharge. Besides, higher levels of OPEs were observed in urban surface water in the summer, and the wet deposition (rainfall) was confirmed to be an important factor for,this observation. Risk assessment showed low or medium risk of OPEs for the organisms (algae, crustacean and fish). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We present new geological and geochemical information from six excavations in upper Bed which revealed up to 1.4-m-thick carbonate deposits, attesting to the presence of freshwater springs in the area surrounding FLK North. The delta O-18 signatures of the tufa are typical for meteoric water that has evolved during evaporation. Tuff IF that caps the sequence was deposited on uneven topography with the highest area a low-relief ridge between two faults at the archaeological site and lowest areas being sites of groundwater discharge. The model proposed here is that rainfall on adjacent highlands was transported to the basin where faults acted as conduits for water. Similar hydrogeological settings at modern lakes Manyara and Eyasi, currently support lush groundwater forest and woodland despite arid climate. FLK North may have been an "oasis" offering freshwater and shelter for consuming meat by both carnivores and hominins. (C) 2010 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This Daphnia was absent in the year 2004, absent during most part of the year 2005 and absent in spring 2007 but present from November 2005 to July 2006. Abundance was high from January to late May of the year 2006; maximum abundance was 95,000 ind. m(-2) (30 May). Males and ephippial females were observed in January and late May. Ovigerous females constituted between 30% and 70% of adult females from November 2005 to April 2006; in June and July their percentage decreased to <20%. Mean number of eggs per egg-bearing female ranged between 2 (in November 2005) and 9.8 (in April 2006) and maximum egg number was 20. Birth and growth rates were. low (generally < 0. 15); death rate was highest in June (0.275). Females of D. pulicaria were larger than females of Daphnia galeata/hyalina but carried somewhat fewer eggs. D. pulicaria generally preferred the deep cool water layers. The species was abundant in the northern parts of the Lower Lake (Gnadensee and Zeller See), rare in the southern parts (Rheinsee) and absent in the Upper Lake. We conclude that the life history and occurrence of large-bodied D. pulicaria in Lake Constance can be governed by fish predation pressure. This suggestion is supported by analyses of stomach contents from Coregonus lavaretus,, stomachs contained high proportions of D. pulicaria in the first half of the year 2006. The disappearance of D. pulicaria in early summer and the comparatively low proportion of adults for most part of the investigation period also indicate that fish predation is involved in the dynamics of this Daphnia. The preference for deep cool water can be strategy to reduce predation risk. The low density of D. pulicaria in the southern basin of Lower Lake (Rheinsee) may be explained by the influence of the Rhine River which flows through this basin. (C) 2007 Elsevier GmbH.

This shift represents temperatures during the bloom season, and may be less than the winter temperature drop. The sharp transition itself, with a duration of about 200 years, suggests that the temperature decrease may have been as large as 12 degrees C.

Long-term Deepwater Dissolved Oxygen Dynamics in a Hypereutrophic Reservoir Following Shifts in Watershed Management and Lake Warming	ECOSYSTEMS												Long-term declines in lake hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO) have been attributed to eutrophication, reduced water clarity, or rising temperatures. DO dynamics in human-made reservoirs may also be influenced by their distinct characteristics (for example, hydrology) and by the high levels of watershed inputs (suspended sediments, nutrients) these systems may receive, particularly in agricultural landscapes. We used a 31 year dataset in a reservoir that has experienced agricultural land management change to ask: (1) What are the long-term trends in two hypolimnetic DO metrics (DO concentration in early summer and summer anoxic factor), and (2) what are the key drivers of these metrics?. We used linear regressions to assess temporal trends, and exhaustive variable selection to identify drivers. Potential drivers included metrics of watershed discharge, temperature, stability, and potential productivity (chlorophyll, nonvolatile suspended sediments; NVSS). We found that deepwater early summer DO concentrations decreased, but there was no temporal trend for anoxic factor. Deepwater DO was best predicted by surface temperature, with warming temperatures related to lower DO. However, the top five models performed similarly, and all included a temperature or stratification metric. Higher stability was related to lower DO. For anoxic factor, the top two models performed similarly with stability, surface temperature, and NVSS identified. Anoxic factor increased with higher surface temperature, lower NVSS, and higher stability. Our findings suggest that DO dynamics were linked to previously recognized drivers (for example, temperature), as well as NVSS, a driver that is rarely acknowledged and may reflect land use and management within the watershed.

The paleohydrological reconstructions show fluctuating lake levels since the end of the Medieval Warm Period (ca. AD 1300) till the late 19th century and a more acute dry period during the late 19th century - early 20th century, after the end of the Little Ice Age. Human activities have played a significant role in Laguna Zonar hydrological changes since the late 19th century, when the outlet was drained, and particularly in the mid-20th century (till 1982) when the spring waters feeding the lake were diverted for human use. Two main periods of increased human activities in the watershed are recorded in the sediments. The first started with the Christian conquest and colonization of the Guadalquivir River Valley (13th century) particularly after the fall of the Granada Kingdom (15th century). The second one corresponds to the late 19th century when more land was dedicated to olive cultivation. Intensification of soil erosion occurred in the mid-20th century, after the introduction of farm machinery. The lake was declared a protected area in the early 1980s, when some agricultural practices were restricted, and conservation measures implemented. As a consequence, the lake level increased, and some littoral zones were submerged. Pollen indicators reflect this limnological change during the last few decades. Geochemical indicators show a relative decrease in soil erosion, but not changes in the amount of chemical fertilizers reaching the lake. This study provides an opportunity to evaluate the relative significance of human vs. climatic factors in lake hydrology and watershed changes during historical times. Paleolimnological reconstructions should be taken into account by natural resources agencies to better define lake management policies, and to assess the results of restoration policies.

J	VANDERMOLEN, DT; BOERS, PCM				VANDERMOLEN, DT; BOERS, PCM			INFLUENCE OF INTERNAL LOADING ON PHOSPHORUS CONCENTRATION IN SHALLOW LAKES BEFORE AND AFTER REDUCTION OF THE EXTERNAL LOADING	HYDROBIOLOGIA												An analysis of data from 49 shallow lakes showed, that the parameters of empirical models between phosphorus loading and concentration in the lake (e.g. Vollenweider type of relations) differ significantly for lakes without or with a reduced external loading. For lakes without a reduction of the external loading the summer phosphorus concentration is determined by the external phosphorus loading and the hydraulic loading. For these lakes the 'classical' models suffice; deviations between calculations and measurements are partly due to errors made in the determination of the loading. In contrast, for lakes where the external loading was reduced, the measured internal loading explains most of the variation in the summer lake concentration. The external loading is of minor importance and the 'classical' models cannot be applied. The internal loading measured before reduction of the external loading is not useful in predicting the concentration afterwards. Instead of the internal loading, the sediment composition can be used. The advantage of using sediment composition is that these variables are easier to determine and vary less in time. The most promising variable is the ratio between total P and total Fe in the sediment.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB 25	1994	275						379	389		10.1007/BF00026728	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026728													WOS:A1994NB19800035

Key results from the salt lake regional smoke, ozone, and aerosol study (SAMOZA)	JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION												The Northern Wasatch Front area is one of similar to 50 metropolitan regions in the U.S. that do not meet the 2015 O-3 standard. To better understand the causes of high O-3 days in this region we conducted the Salt Lake regional Smoke, Ozone and Aerosol Study (SAMOZA) in the summer of 2022. The primary goals of SAMOZA were: (1) Measure a suite of VOCs, by Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS) and the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) cartridge method. (2) Evaluate whether the standard UV O-3 measurements made in SLC show a positive bias during smoke events, as has been suggested in some recent studies. (3) Use the observations to conduct photochemical modeling and statistical/machine learning analyses to understand photochemistry on both smoke-influenced and non-smoke days. Implications: The Northern Wasatch Front area is one of similar to 50 metropolitan regions in the U.S. that do not meet the 2015 O-3 standard. To better understand the causes of high O-3 days in this region we conducted the Salt Lake regional Smoke, Ozone and Aerosol Study (SAMOZA) in the summer of 2022.

J	Klug, JL; Whitney, K				Klug, Jennifer L.; Whitney, Katherine			Long-term Trends in Water Quality in a New England Hydroelectric Impoundment	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Lake Lillinonah, a hydroelectric impoundment on the Housatonic River, CT, is characterized by frequent and extensive algal blooms during the summer months, and historical accounts from the lake's early years document the fact that algal blooms (dominated by cyanobacteria) have been a concern since the lake's creation in 1955. Algal blooms create lethal oxygen conditions for aquatic organisms, impair recreation, and produce toxins that are harmful to people, pets, and wildlife. To help understand current and future trends in water quality, we reconstructed the historical water quality of Lake Lillinonah from 1974 to 2009. Our results suggest that water temperature, phosphorus concentration, and nitrogen concentration all play a role in determining summer water clarity. Additionally, although total phosphorus concentration has decreased since the early 1970s, total nitrogen concentration has remained constant likely due to differences in watershed nutrient-management strategies, and water clarity in the lake remains poor. We suggest that a continued effort to reduce both nitrogen-and phosphorus-loading is necessary in order to improve water clarity, particularly considering the observed increase in storm-loading events and warmer temperatures predicted as the climate warms.																			1092-6194	1938-5307				JUN	2015	22	2					273	286		10.1656/045.022.0204	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/045.022.0204													WOS:000370898300004

A one-perch fidelity index was computed for 217 individuals. It appears that the perch fidelity increases with the age of the Cormorant, but is not correlated with the duration of stay of the bird on the roost. This last point, confirmed by examples of young birds migrating to the south and showing a high fidelity during their short stay on the roost, tends to prove that the competition for a perch on inland lakes is but one of the factors influencing the latitudinal distribution of the Cormorants according to age.																			0373-2266						1995	83	1					281	284																WOS:A1995RM43100030
J	Fleming, ED; Prufert-Bebout, L				Fleming, Erich D.; Prufert-Bebout, Leslie			Characterization of cyanobacterial communities from high-elevation lakes in the Bolivian Andes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The Bolivian Altiplano is a harsh environment for life with high solar irradiation (visible and UVR), below freezing temperatures, and some of the lowest precipitation rates on the planet. However, microbial life is visibly abundant in small isolated refugia of spring or snowmelt-fed lakes. In this study, we characterized the cyanobacterial composition of a variety of microbial mats present in three lake systems: Laguna Blanca, Laguna Verde (elevation 4300 m), and a summit lake in the Licancabur Volcano cone (elevation 5970 m). These lakes and their adjacent geothermal springs present an interesting diversity of environments within a geographically small region (5 km(2)). From these sites, 78 cyanobacterial cultures were isolated in addition to similar to 400 cyanobacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences from environmental genomic DNA. Based on microscopy, cultivation, and molecular analyses, these communities contained many heterocytous, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria (e.g., Calothrix, Nostoc, Nodularia) as well as a large number of cyanobacteria belonging to the form-genus Leptolyngbya. More than a third (37%) of all taxa in this study were new species (<= 96% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity), and 11% represented new and novel taxa distantly related (<= 93% identity) to any known cyanobacteria. This is one of the few studies to characterize cyanobacterial communities based on both cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent analyses.																			2169-8953	2169-8961				JAN 7	2010	115								G00D07	10.1029/2008JG000817	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2008JG000817													WOS:000273507500001

In this paper, we present three well-dated mud/peat cores from a paleo-pingo depression in the Sanjiang Plain, a climatically sensitive region to monsoon variation, to reveal the paleoenvironmental history of the wetland and discuss the regional impacts from monsoon evolution. A paleolake developed in the study area before 5.5 ka BP, and a peatland initiated thereafter consequent upon the gradual shrinking of the paleolake. This transition lasted until 4.5 ka BP, when the paleolake changed entirely to a wetland. Considering the prevalent monsoon climate in the Sanjiang Plain, we suggest that the lake-to-wetland transition from 5.5 to 4.5 ka BP indicates a rapid decline of the East Asian summer monsoon in addition to autogenic basin infilling processes. Such a remarkable monsoon weakening event has been documented across northern China, and we associate this with ocean-atmosphere interactions throughout low-latitude regions.

The following water bodies were sampled: glacial streams, cold springs cold mountain and warm lowland streams with stony bottom, gravel, sand and silt bottom, headwaters in the lowlands, large rivers, small alpine lakes, large pre-alpine lakes, small ponds, man-made springs, man-made lakes, etc. The samples were collected in the Alps, the Apennines, the Padania lowlands and in the Mediterranean area. The specimens collected were mounted on permanent slides. Genera are easily well identified, but their ecological significance is doubtful. However many species are not easily identified because of the lack of taxonomic information. An ordination of sites and genera was first attempted using principal component (PCA) and de-trended correspondence analysis (DCA). The first DCA axis and the first 2 PCA axes exhibit an approximate ordination according to an upstream-downstream gradient, which is correlated with water temperature, oxygen content, substrate, water speed etc. Three genera belonging to three different tribes of Chironomidae (Eukiefferiella, Paratanytarsus and Paratendipes) were selected as examples of different species response within the same genus.

Mapping and spatial analyses revealed that abiotic factors, as well as crustacean abundances, were structured along a gradient in the great lake basin. Chlorophyll a biomass, bacteria density, cyclopoid abundance, and fish biomass showed more patchy or inshore-offshore distribution patterns. Using canonical analyses, we determined the relative contribution of the spatial and environmental factors to the distribution of macrozooplankton species and of trophic groups based on herbivory and omnivory/carnivory. The distribution of macrozooplankton can be explained by small-scale variations and lake gradients in abiotic and biotic factors, with a dominant contribution of the abiotic factors. Water temperature and stability, as well as ammonium, are the main factors related to macrozooplankton distribution in Lake of Geneva during spring. Chlorophyll a biomass was also related to the distribution of cyclopoids. The canonical models explained 35-72% of the variance in the distribution of total crustaceans, species, and trophic groups. However, 28-65% of the macrozooplankton variance remained unexplained, which may be due to fine-scale variations in other environmental factors.

The sampling was conducted weekly at four depths from mid-July until mid-September 2014, in order to detect short-term changes within the assemblages. Besides physical and chemical parameters, meteorological data was also included in the investigation, as that year was characterized with extreme rainfall, which caused serious flooding in the region. The community succession was characterized by a reverse in the cyanobacteria (Codon M) and chlorococcal green algae (Coda F and J). Statistical analyses (RDA) indicated that changes in the community composition and successional pattern could have been due to the mixing regime variations in the reservoir, most likely induced by weather disturbances, especially high precipitation and wind events. These events did not permit massive cyanobacterial development, although they most likely caused resuspension of dissolved phosphorus from the sediment. When observing functional groups, three groups could be distinguished by their response to the above-mentioned parameters: the first prefers high temperature and insolation(Lm, Y, Lo, Xph, W2andM), the second is correlated with precipitation and wind (Td, C, K, MP and X2), while the third group tolerates cloudiness (H1, F, N, X1, D, J and P).

This chapter reviews the progress, primarily in the context of studies on Florida lakes, and describes major issues that remain to be addressed. At the landscape level, P concentrations and export tares can be predicted as a function of land use conditions in many parts of the country, but the accuracy of such predictions for Florida lakes is still crude because of their complicated hydrology and poorly defined catchment boundaries. Atmospheric loadings contribute significantly to the P budgets of Florida lakes, even large, shallow eutrophic ones like Lake Apopka. Much of this loading is from particulate dry fall rather than wet precipitation. Because the atmospheric transport scale for P-containing particles is small (order of tens to hundreds of meters), land-based precipitation samplers are likely to overestimate atmospheric P loading to large lakes. Mild winters and long seasons for biological growth in Florida lakes dampen the seasonal patterns of P concentrations that occur typically in temperate lakes. Colored natural organic matter (humic substances), high concentrations of which are found in many Florida lakes, significantly affects the relationship between chlorophyll and total P levels, and further work is needed on this subject. In contrast, P cycling processes are rather insensitive to pH, at least at the whole ecosystem level, within the wide range of pH (similar to 4 to 9) found in Florida lakes. P cycling in lakes cannot be fully understood without considering the sedimentary P cycle and sediment-water interactions. Recent studies have shown that sediment P accumulation rates can be determined even in such shallow lakes as Okeechobee. P accumulation in this lake has increased by a factor of four during the 20th century, suggesting that its external P loading has in creased substantially over that time period. P sorption to sediments often fits a simple Langmuir isotherm, but more complicated models that consider electrostatic interactions and nonuniform binding site energies are needed in some cases. Finally, internal loading of P from sediments is a critical factor affecting the recovery of shallow eutrophic lakes once external loading is controlled. A model that explicitly considers internal loading shows that this process is likely to maintain hypereutrophic conditions in Lake Apopka for many decades after external sources are controlled, unless additional steps are taken to remove or isolate the P-rich sediments from the water column.

However, controversy remains with regard to the climatic boundary between these westerly and monsoon regimes. In this paper, detailed rock magnetic and geochemical Rb/Sr analyses for a larger number of surface soils from a wide area in the NE Tibetan Plateau are presented. They show that surface soils in this region evince relatively significant regional variations in magnetic properties and geochemical characteristics. The magnetic parameters chi(fd), chi(ARM) and geochemical Rb/Sr ratios exhibit higher values in EASM-controlled (humid) areas, and lower values in Westerlies-influenced (arid) areas. These characteristics indicate that such variations in chi(fd), chi(ARM) and Rb/Sr ratios can be regarded as effective indicators of the degree of pedogenesis and weathering in the NE Tibetan Plateau. Our results also demonstrate that the climatic boundary between the westerly and monsoon regimes approximately overlaps with the boundary of highland meadow and temperate steppe desert/desert in NW China.

Discriminant function analyses based on eight external morphometric variables (wing chord, tarsus length, middle toe length, hind toe length, culmen, head length, naris width, and bill width) did not accurately distinguish Black Ducks from Mallards. Discriminant function analyses produced correct classification rates that, averaged over the four age - sex classes, were 61% for Mallards and 71% for Black Ducks. The highest classification rates were from the discriminant function analyses of Ontario Black Ducks and New Brunswick Black Ducks that, averaged over the four age-sex classes, were 74% for Ontario Black Ducks and 80% for New Brunswick Black Ducks. Although our morphometric analyses did not incorporate all morphometric characteristics of Black Ducks and Mallards, they do show that Black Ducks and Mallards collected in eastern Canada are morphometrically very similar.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				DEC	1994	72	12					2248	2251		10.1139/z94-300	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z94-300													WOS:A1994QW00500024

An approach for computing dissolved oxygen concentration is suggested assuming horizontally mixed waters and negligable vertical dispersion. It is found that the depletion of dissolved oxygen is mainly due to the transfer of oxygen at the water/sediment interface. The morphology of a lake is very important for how fast the dissolved oxygen concentration is reduced during winter.

J	Stevic, F; Mihaljevic, M; Spoljaric, D				Stevic, Filip; Mihaljevic, Melita; Spoljaric, Dubravka			Changes of phytoplankton functional groups in a floodplain lake associated with hydrological perturbations	HYDROBIOLOGIA												During the past decade, basic hydrological conditions of a floodplain lake in the middle Danube section have been altered with long-lasting extremely high flooding. The objective of the paper is to show the effectiveness of the functional approach to explain phytoplankton changes associated with hydrological events. Intensity and duration of flooding were qualified as the primary cause for the changes of functional groups. Flooding phase was characterised by diatoms (B, C, D, P, T (B) ) tolerant to water column mixing. Due to the dilution and washout effect their biomass was low during the long-lasting flooding despite their input from the river. Co-occurrence of coccoid green algae (X1, J, F) was associated with turbid and mixed waters. High-nutrient concentrations and water column stability during the long-term dry conditions led to the dominance and high biomass of cyanobacteria. Low-nitrogen H1 group was particularly sensitive to stress caused by flooding, while filamentous N-2-fixing (S (N) ) and non N-2-fixing species (S1) showed tolerance to short-term flooding. The development of euglenoids and dinoflagellates (W1, W2, L (O) ) was also associated with dry conditions and seasonal changes in autumn. The functional classification allows representing of the hydrological phases which characterise the phytoplankton succession in highly disturbed river-floodplain systems.

Late summer glacial meltwater contributions to Bull Lake Creek stream flow and water quality, Wind River Range, Wyoming, USA	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												The Wind River Range in Wyoming contains more glacial ice than any other location within the USA's Rocky Mountain states of Colorado, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. Bull Lake Creek watershed in the southeast portion of the range contains five major (0.6-1.5 km(2)) glaciers along with numerous smaller glaciers that contribute to the Wind River. Field measurements were made of discharge from the Knife Point and Bull Lake Glaciers to determine the contribution of glacial meltwater to the river system. Water samples were collected and analyzed for stable isotopes, major ions, nutrients, and selected trace elements. Meltwater from the two glaciers contributed 13.9% to Bull Lake Creek streamflow (site BL-3), with all glaciers within the Bull Lake Creek watershed estimated to be contributing 55.6% to the streamflow of Bull Lake Creek (United States Geological Survey gage) during the August 2015 study period. Hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope analysis indicated as much as 80% of late summer discharge in the upper Bull Lake Creek watershed was attributed to glacial meltwater. This study also found that nutrients (NO3 - NO2, total P) from glacial meltwater can be a significant source of nutrient loading to Bull Lake Creek.

Impacts of anthropogenic effects on river ice regime: Examples from Eastern Central Europe	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Anthropogenic effects on rivers, including engineering regulation, hydropower usage, and water pollution, not only change bed morphology and/or water quality but also affect the river ice regime. The length of the ice-affected season and the relative frequency of ice appearance might alter due to anthropogenic activities. Moreover, anthropogenically induced changes may vastly exceed climatic effects. When the prevailing non-natural impact co-varies with the trend of the expected climate trigger (e.g. winter air temperature), conclusions can be biased if the anthropogenic effects were not scrutinized in depth. This paper presents examples when changes in some characteristic feature of the river ice regime are related to human activities. These simple tests could be applied for other rivers, where similar anthropogenic impacts may be suspected to affect the river ice regime. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Questions regarding the nonlinearity and chaotic characteristics of the system necessitate the examination of dynamical properties. Toward this objective the time series of daily average discharges is analyzed in detail. First, the dimensionality of the dynamics in the reconstructed phase space is found to be quite low, similar to 3-4. Then several tests are applied to examine the nonlinearity and the presence of noise in the data. Using the surrogate time series test, a high degree of nonlinearity and a deterministic nature are revealed, while the differentiation test showed that the presence of high-frequency noise in the series of the discharge is not dynamically important. These suggest that an attempt to forecast the short-term future behavior of this time series may turn out to be quite successful. Nonlinear methods, such as Farmer's algorithm and artificial neural networks, were employed and found to exhibit a very satisfactory predictive ability, with neural networks achieving a slightly better performance.

J	French, CG; Wahl, DH				French, Christopher G.; Wahl, David H.			Influences of dissolved oxygen on juvenile largemouth bass foraging behaviour	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Summer stratification often leads to large areas of hypolimnetic hypoxia in lakes and reservoirs. These areas of hypoxia alter fish behaviours and distributions as well as restrict access to valuable prey resources, yet few studies have examined foraging behaviour of fish in response to low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. We observed foraging behaviour of juvenile largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, in response to varying DO concentrations in tanks that simulated a stratified lake water column during the summer: 28 degrees C oxygenated epilimnion, 15 degrees C deoxygenated hypolimnion. Compared with saturated concentrations (8.0-9.0mg/L), hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations of 3.0mg/L and 1.5mg/L resulted in a drastic decrease in prey consumption, handling efficiency and time spent below the thermocline mainly due to avoidance behaviour of hypoxic conditions. However, we found at high hypolimnetic prey densities, individual fish were more willing to venture into reduced oxygen concentrations. Several unique behaviours including transporting prey above the oxycline for consumption, aquatic surface respiration and gill flaring were employed by largemouth bass foraging in low oxygen environments. Reduced hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations may influence and alter feeding strategies, especially for fish that rely on benthic prey resources.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				APR	2018	27	2					559	569		10.1111/eff.12370	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12370													WOS:000426610900005

The effect of morphometric characteristics and geographic zonality on thermal stratification of lakes	WATER RESOURCES												Long-term data (1945-1989) collected during regular observations of water temperature on a network of Roshydromet stations in different types of water bodies in Northwestern European Russia are generalized. A number of mathematical expressions, which are relatively simple and acceptable for wide circles of researchers, are proposed for the assessment of the thermal state of water bodies. Empirical dependences of the thickness of epilimnion, the depth to thermocline, the type of thermal stratification, seasonal variations in the temperature of water surface, and individual characteristics of the "biological summer" on various geographic factors are established. Elements of thermal regime are calculated for the database of ecological-geographical typification of Karelian water bodies.

Seventeen species were recorded; the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) was the most common bird and on average represented 81.1% of the total population. Most of the waterbirds were observed in oxbow lakes, and these areas were positively selected by all species. Canals and streams were preferred by ducks. The river was avoided by all species, and reservoirs were only used by teals (Anas crecca) and, to a lesser extent, by mallards. Riparian vegetation cover and disturbance were the main factors affecting the distribution of waterbirds. Most of the wildfowl used the wetlands only for roosting. A reduction in the movement of birds from roosting to feeding sites (mainly maize and wheat stubbles), and hence a reduction in the mortality caused by hunting, could be achieved by management practices aimed at increasing aquatic vegetation in the wetlands.																			0373-4137						1989	56	1					81	85																WOS:A1989AR09300011

Uncertainties exist especially about the water depth, water temperatures and annual temperature fluctuations. Here, we analyse the preservation of the most abundant fish of the lakes, the teleost Lycoptera, articulated skeletons of which occur in large concentrations suggestive of mass mortality. Taphonomic features such as degree of disarticulation, orientation patterns and displacement of skeletal elements reveal distinct preservational patterns. They suggest that the water temperature was low during winter and exhibited pronounced seasonal fluctuations. The depth of the lakes was not deep. Possible causes of the fish mortality are discussed, of which anoxia is favoured. This leads to a more refined palaeoenvironmental model for these palaeolakes, which harbour one of the most important Mesozoic Lagerstatten.																			0031-0239	1475-4983				MAY	2015	58	3					537	561		10.1111/pala.12160	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pala.12160													WOS:000353398000009

Samples of river water were taken at the same time for chemical analysis and sediment particle size has also been investigated. At two sites below the barrages the salinity varied depending on the volume of water discharged through the barrages. It rose almost to that of sea water while they remained closed, but fell to that of the river water when they were all open and discharging large volumes of river water. The nematode population fluctuated from about 12 200 to 180 000 m-2 for nine months, but the numbers of live nematodes fell sharply in July through to September, accompanied by heavy nematode mortality, reaching 100 % at one site in August. We attribute the mortality to a prolonged discharge of river water. More than 40 genera have been identified, most with cosmopolitan distributions. Above the barrages, at Mundoo and on Lake Alexandrina the water is fresh river water. The fauna was less dense than that below the barrages; with a maximum of 10 000 m-2. It comprised genera typical of freshwaters overseas (no comparable studies of Australian freshwater nematodes have been reported), such as Eutobrilus, Tripyla and Ironus, together with two species from typical marine genera, i.e. Mesacanthion and Enoploides. The latter species is very similar to E.fluviatilis from the Volga river. It is suggested that low population density below the barrages, when compared with other estuaries, reflects periodic mortality in estuarine nematodes when salinity falls drastically, whilst above the barrages there is a mixture of tolerant estuarine and typical freshwater nematodes.

Food-web structure and planktonic predator-prey relationships in two eutrophic European lakes: Stability constraints on carbon fluxes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The food webs in two eutrophic European lakes were analyzed with respect to their stability characteristics. The food web during the summer in Lake Nesjovatn (Norway) appeared to be stable; its response time to small perturbations was similar to 12 d. In Lake Kastoria (Greece), the summer food web was almost neutrally stable, with a response time of similar to 160 d. The major difference in the two systems was the species composition of the phytoplankton community, which was dominated by unicellular cryptophytes in Lake Nesjovatn and by toxic filamentous and colonial cyanobacteria in Lake Kastoria. The macrozooplankton in both lakes showed a distinct inclination toward carnivory versus herbivory, and the heterotrophic flagellates showed a preference for small phytoplankton versus heterotrophic bacteria as a food source. The requirement for stability of the food webs constrains the grazing rates of predators to values substantially less than those that would maximize the energy flux through the system. This is especially true when a predator preferentially consumes one of several prey species.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2008	53	2					760	772		10.4319/lo.2008.53.2.0760	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2008.53.2.0760													WOS:000256498700032

A popular put-grow-and-take fishery for rainbow trout S. gairdneri has become established in Lake Taneycomo, but fishing success and effort decline each fall when O2-depleted waters enter the lake. The fishery was examined in detail from June 1978-May 1980. During this period, catch rates of rainbow trout averaged 0.55 fish/h, and were influenced by dissolved O2 concentration, number of fish available to be caught, discharge rate from the upstream reservoir, angler experience and water temperature. A decrease of 1 mg/l dissolved O2, between 6.0-2.4 mg/l, reduced catch rates by 0.1 fish/h. During the fall, a change in catch rate of 0.1 fish/h can result in a change of 20,000 h of fishing at Lake Taneycomo. The expected annual economic loss to the Taney County economy due to low concentrations of the dissolved O2 is $58,000 (range, $267,000-$432,000).																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1984	113	2					109	124		10.1577/1548-8659(1984)113<109:EODDOT>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1984)113<109:EODDOT>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1984SQ64200001

J	NIXDORF, B				NIXDORF, B			POLYMIXIS OF A SHALLOW LAKE (GROSSER-MUGGELSEE, BERLIN) AND ITS INFLUENCE ON SEASONAL PHYTOPLANKTON DYNAMICS	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The polymictic properties of Lake Muggelsee, a eutrophic shallow lake in Berlin, are described by the water column stability (N2) and gradients in saturation of oxygen at the deepest site of the lake (7.5 m). Mixing and stratification changed irregularly up to 7 times during the vegetation season (April to September), as was indicated by all of the stratification parameters. Thermally stable conditions generally lasted 1-2 weeks. A maximum of 5 weeks stratification was observed in 1982. In order to investigate the response of algal development, the internal rates of change of the dominant algal species in the lake during the vegetation period were estimated from weekly measurements of phytoplankton biomass from 1980 to 1990. The necessity taking a mixed sample in a shallow lake is discussed. The polymictic properties favoured the development of specific blue-green algal species; there dominance was also favoured by the trophic conditions. Among the dominant blue-greens the growth of Limnothrix redekei was independent of polymixis whereas stratification supported the starting conditions for the summer blue-greens Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Planktothrix agardhii. After these algae reached a distinct level of biomass, they grew under mixing as well as under stratified conditions. For the development of solitary centric diatoms during summer regulation by growth restriction through nutrient limitation, esp. dissolved silicon was more important. However, Melosira sp. developed well under stratified conditions but collapsed due to increased sinking losses when the water column became too stable. An attempt is made to apply Reynolds' possibility matrix of the most likely phytoplankton assemblages as a function of nutrients and mixing in the shallow Lake Muggelsee.																			0018-8158					FEB 25	1994	275						173	186		10.1007/BF00026709	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026709													WOS:A1994NB19800016

Reintroduction actions include the release of several life stages including fry, fall fingerlings, and yearling smolts. In this study we describe the diet of recently released fall fingerling Atlantic salmon in a tributary of the Salmon River, New York. A specific objective of the study was to determine if juvenile Atlantic salmon would utilize the high caloric food source provided by introduced Pacific salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.) that includes eggs and carcass flesh. Salmon eggs and carcass flesh comprised 20.5% of the October to January diet in 2013-14 and 23.9% in 2014-15. The consumption of steelhead (O. mykiss) eggs was a major part of the diet in April in both 2014 (54.1%) and 2015 (33.2%).

Can We Detect Urban-Scale CO2 Emission Changes Within Medium-Sized Cities?	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a widespread lockdown during the spring of 2020. Measurements collected on a light rail system in the Salt Lake Valley (SLV), combined with observations from the Utah Urban Carbon Dioxide Network observed a notable decrease in urban CO2 concentrations during the spring of 2020 relative to previous years. These decreases coincided with a similar to 30% reduction in average traffic volume. CO2 measurements across the SLV were used within a Bayesian inverse model to spatially allocate anthropogenic emission reductions for the first COVID-19 lockdown. The inverse model was first used to constrain anthropogenic emissions for the previous year (2019) to provide the best possible estimate of emissions for 2020, before accounting for emission reductions observed during the COVID-19 lockdown. The posterior emissions for 2019 were then used as the prior emission estimate for the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown analysis. Results from the inverse analysis suggest that the SLV observed a 20% decrease in afternoon CO2 emissions from March to April 2020 (-90.5 tC hr(-1)). The largest reductions in CO2 emissions were centered over the northern part of the valley (downtown Salt Lake City), near major roadways, and potentially at industrial point sources. These results demonstrate that CO2 monitoring networks can track reductions in CO2 emissions even in medium-sized cities like Salt Lake City.					; Mitchell, Logan/A-5481-2011; Mallia, Derek/JFK-8237-2023; Kunik, Lewis/KOC-1109-2024	Mallia, Derek/0000-0003-1983-7305; Mitchell, Logan/0000-0002-8749-954X; Lin, John/0000-0003-2794-184X; Kunik, Lewis/0000-0001-9638-0543; Gonzalez, Andres/0000-0001-5268-5791; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				JUN 16	2023	128	11							e2023JD038686	10.1029/2023JD038686	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023JD038686													WOS:001160701300001

However, climate syntheses for the Eemian remain hampered by lack of data from the high-latitude land areas, masking the climate response and feedbacks in the Arctic. Here we present a high-resolution (sub-centennial) record of Eemian palaeoclimate from northern Finland, with multi-model reconstructions for July and January air temperature. In contrast with the mid-latitudes of Europe, our data show decoupled seasonal trends with falling July and rising January temperatures over the Eemian, due to orbital and oceanic forcings. This leads to an oceanic Late-Eemian climate, consistent with an earlier hypothesis of glacial inception in Europe. The interglacial is further intersected by two strong cooling and drying events. These abrupt events parallel shifts in marine proxy data, linked to disturbances in the North Atlantic oceanic circulation regime.

Microbial communities mediating algal detritus turnover under anaerobic conditions	PEERJ												Background. Algae encompass a wide array of photosynthetic organisms that are ubiquitously distributed in aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Algal species often bloom in aquatic ecosystems, providing a significant autochthonous carbon input to the deeper anoxic layers in stratified water bodies. In addition, various algal species have been touted as promising candidates for anaerobic biogas production from biomass. Surprisingly, in spite of its ecological and economic relevance, the microbial community involved in algal detritus turnover under anaerobic conditions remains largely unexplored. Results. Here, we characterized the microbial communities mediating the degradation of Chlorella vulgaris (Chlorophyta), Chara sp. strain IWP1 (Charophyceae), and kelp Ascophyllum nodosum (phylum Phaeophyceae), using sediments from an anaerobic spring (Zodlteone spring, OK; ZDT), sludge from a secondary digester in a local wastewater treatment plant (Stillwater, OK; WVVT), and deeper anoxic layers from a seasonally stratified lake (Grand Lake O' the Cherokees, OK; GL) as linoculum sources. Within all enrichments, the majority of algal biomass was metabolized within 13-16 weeks, and the process was accompanied by an increase in cell numbers and a decrease in community diversity. Community surveys based on the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene identified different lineages belonging to the phyla Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria (alpha, delta,gamma and epsilon classes), Spirochaetes, and Firmicutes that were selectively abundant under various substrate and inoculum conditions. Within all kelp enrichments, the microbial communities structures at the conclusion of the experiment were highly similar regardless of the enrichment source, and were dominated by the genus Clostridium, or family Veillonellaceae within the Firmicutes. In all other enrichments the final microbial community was dependent on the inoculum source, rather than the type of algae utilized as substrate. Lineages enriched included the uncultured groups VadinBC27 and WCHB1-69 within the Bacteroidetes, genus Spirochaeta and the uncultured group SHA-4 within Spirochaetes, Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Yongiibacter, Geosporobacter, and Acidaminobacter within the Firmicutes, and genera Kluyvera, Pantoea, Edwardsiella and Aeromonas, and Buttiauxella within the Gamnia-Proteobaceteria order Enterobacteriales. Conclusions. Our results represent the first systematic survey of microbial communities mediating turnover of algal biomass under anaerobic conditions, and highlights the diversity of lineages putatively involved in the degradation process.

The trade-off between crop production and water quality services is one of the most serious issues facing agriculture, and interest in achieving win-win outcomes through management of ecosystem services is growing. Although wetlands can reduce nitrogen loads, it is unclear whether maintaining and restoring wetlands can ameliorate the trade-off between crop production and water quality and thereby increase the likelihood of win-win outcomes. We defined the orthogonal residuals from the regression line relating the trade-offs between two conflicting services as the degree to which the trade-off was mitigated (mitigation effectiveness score). The more positive the residual, the higher mitigation effectiveness score, and the greater the potential to mitigate the trade-off. We measured nitrate concentrations, as an indicator of water quality, five times during summer and winter across 49 sub-watersheds of the watershed of Lake Kasumigaura, which is highly nitrogen-loaded by agriculture. We quantified the mitigation effectiveness score from the trade-off relationships between cropland area and nitrate concentrations, and we also identified landscape and environmental factors that affected these scores. Some sub-watersheds in our study had high cropland cover but low nitrate concentrations. Overall, we found that mitigation effectiveness scores were positively associated with wetland cover at all sampling times. Other factors, including covers of paddy rice fields, abandoned rice fields, and impervious surfaces, and dissolved organic carbon concentrations, had no significant effects on mitigation effectiveness scores, although these factors were considered to increase nitrogen removal. Our findings suggest that maintaining and restoring wetlands might mitigate the trade-off between crop production and water quality and thereby enhance the likelihood of win-win outcomes in agricultural landscapes. Because wetland area has decreased, flooding or ponding abandoned rice fields may be an important alternative management option. The nitrate concentrations we observed met the water quality standard for drinking water, but the fact that they sometimes exceeded the nitrogen environmental target adopted within Lake Kasumigaura in terms of eutrophication suggests that simultaneous reduction of croplands and fertilizer inputs should still be encouraged.					; Kadoya, Taku/L-7536-2013; Sasai, Takahiro/E-6417-2011; Matsuzaki, Shinichiro/C-6543-2012; Matsushita, Bunkei/E-1036-2014	Matsushita, Bunkei/0000-0001-6397-1144; Yamaguchi, Haruyo/0000-0001-5269-1614; Watanabe, Mirai/0000-0002-2132-7032													2150-8925					NOV	2019	10	11							e02918	10.1002/ecs2.2918	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2918													WOS:000512727700002

Autotrophic and heterotrophic associated biosignatures in modern freshwater microbialites over seasonal and spatial gradients	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles and isotopic biosignatures associated with autotrophic and heterotrophic microbial processes in freshwater microbialites exposed to seasonal and spatial gradients in Pavilion Lake, British Columbia were investigated. The PLFA biosignature profiles of the microbialite associated microbial communities were dominated by saturated and monoenoic PLFAs and showed no resolvable response to variation in light or temperature down to a water depth of 33 m and across seasons. Microbialite mean delta C-13(org) values (-26.0 +/- 3.8 parts per thousand) and Delta delta C-13(DIC-org) discrimination of ca. 25 parts per thousand supported non-CO2 limited photosynthesis. More abundant and C-13-depleted PLFAs (Delta delta C-13 7-14 parts per thousand vs. bulk organic matter) were indicative of autotrophic microbes. Less abundant and C-13-depleted PLFAs (Delta delta C-13 3-4%) were indicative of heterotrophic organisms, particularly branched (iso/anteiso15: 0 and 10me16: 0) PLFAs. Dark coloured microbialites from the bottom of the lake (below 46 m water depth) had comparatively low biomass and a higher proportion of branched PLFAs, including biomarkers for sulfate reducing bacteria. Bulk delta C-13(carb) values of microbialite carbonate at 6 and 11 m water depth were up to ca. 2 parts per thousand more C-13 enriched than the value predicted for precipitation from ambient dissolved inorganic carbon and had increased biomass in summer, indicating a preserved biosignature of photosynthetic activity. Other delta C-13(carb) values were generally within the range predicted for equilibrium precipitation. Estimated precipitation temperature values from delta O-18(carb) were consistent with measured late summer water values. While both autotrophic and heterotrophic processes occurred at all depths, preservation of an enriched C-13 biosignature was only detected at shallow depths where photosynthetic activity and biomass production were relatively high.

Warming trends in large, deep lakes, which are often inferred by the observations of lake surface temperature (LST) in most studies, are strongly linked to the total lake heat content. In this study, we use a 3D hydrodynamic model to examine the nonlinear processes of water mixing and ice formation that cause changes in lake heat content and further variation of LST. With a focus on mechanism study, a series of process-oriented experiments is carried out to understand the interactions among these processes and their relative importance to the lake heat budget. Using this hydrodynamic model, we estimate the lake heat content by integrating over the entire 3D volume. Our analysis reveals that (1) Heat content trends do not necessarily follow (can even be opposed to) trends in LST. Hence, using LST as a warming indicator can be problematic; (2) vertical mixing in water column may play a more important role in regulating lake warming than traditionally expected. Changes in the water mixing pattern can have a prolonged effect on the thermal structure; (3) Ice albedo feedback, even in cold winters, has little impact on lake thermal structure, and its influence on lake warming may have been overestimated. Our results indicate that climate change will not only affect the air-lake energy exchange but can also alter lake internal dynamics, therefore, the lake's response to a changing climate may vary with time.					; Xue, Pengfei/P-4016-2014; Huang, Chenfu/G-9662-2014; Xue, Pengfei/P-4016-2014; Anderson, Eric/JYO-8924-2024	Anderson, Eric/0000-0001-5342-8383; Chu, Philip/0000-0002-3089-0353; Xue, Pengfei/0000-0002-5702-421X; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2019	64	2					558	574		10.1002/lno.11059	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11059													WOS:000461865500010

Between 11.5 and 9.3 ka, a sharp decrease in delta O-18 indicates a rapid increase in monsoon precipitation. An interval of generally high monsoon precipitation is observed between 9.3 and 4.4 ka. An arid period has prevailed between 4.4 and 2.1 ka. The long-term trend of Shanbao record appears to follow summer insolation at 33 degrees N latitude. An abrupt decrease in monsoon precipitation around 4.3 ka is synchronous with the collapse of Neolithic culture in central China. This abrupt change could have resulted from the amplification of the gradually decreased summer insolation by the positive vegetation-atmosphere-aerosol feedback. The weakened Asian monsoon events were in concert with decreased Greenland temperature during the early Holocene, centered at 8.2, 8.6, 9.3, 10.2 and 11.0 ka. This correlation suggests that changes in low-latitude monsoon are connected with climate change in high-latitude polar region.

More recently we reported genotoxic effects induced in fish (erythrocytes) collected in five locations along the rivers Drenica and Sitnica during 2016 and 2017.In this paper, the data obtained from the assessment of the genetic damages in the erythrocytes of fish (Rutilus rutilus) collected in spring 2017 (May-June) and in two sampling rounds in spring 2018 (March-April and May-June) are presented. The fish specimens were collected in three locations along the river Drenica and two locations along the Sitnica river while the fish specimens from Lake Badovc were used for comparison. Erythrocytes of collected fish were investigated using the Comet assay and micronucleus formation as indicators of the genotoxic potential of the river water.The obtained data show differences as regard to the genetic damages in the erythrocytes of individuals which are specific as regard to the location and seasons as well as for the type of damages (% of DNA in tail and/or micronucleated cells). Together with the data published previously, a more complete picture of the season and location associated variations in the genotoxicity was obtained showing that variations are specific and attributable also to the influence of the non-point pollution sources with various chemistry and amount as well as the hydrological characteristics which are not monitored and investigated at satisfactorily level.

J	Gençalioglu-Kuscu, G; Uslular, G				Gencalioglu-Kuscu, Gonca; Uslular, Goksu			Geochemical characterization of mid-distal Nisyros tephra on Datca peninsula (southwestern Anatolia)	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												We present new distal records of tephra deposits that overly the Kos ignimbrite in seven locations of Datca peninsula. Tephra in one of these locations were previously associated with Nisyros Kyra sub-unit based only on the field characteristics. We use different proxies such as field observations, petrography, mineral, glass, and whole-rock chemistry in order to characterize and correlate the previously and recently identified pumice fall deposits on Datca. The total thickness of the fall deposit reaches to 3.5 m. The size of the pumice clasts is generally within the range of lapilli, and they have vitrophyric texture consisting mainly of plagioclase (andesine to labradorite) with scarce clinopyroxene (diopside to augite), olivine (Fo(48-50)), amphibole (magnesio-hastingsite), and biotite crystals. Amphibole is a ubiquitous phenocryst in all Datca tephra units and used as a criterion for the correlation. Glass major element analyses by EMPA reveal two different groups with andesitic and dacitic compositions. Difference in silica content (up to ca. 4 wt%) detected in the same specimen also designates the heterogeneity in pumice glass. This heterogeneity in glass composition is also supported by the frequent occurrence of banded pumice clasts in Datca tephra. Whole-rock composition of the pumice is mainly andesitic with calc-alkaline affinity. Multi-element patterns on primitive-mantle normalized diagram display typical arc-magmatism signature (i.e. depletion in Nb, Ta, Ti, and P). In order to check and eliminate the potential alternatives, we compared the distal deposits on Datca not only with Kyra, but also with other Nisyros tephra units. Yet, Kyra is the only unit that has comparable depositional characteristics, calcic amphibole crystals, andesitic-dacitic glass and whole-rock chemistry, and distal tephra deposits on neighboring islands (Tilos and Chalki). Therefore, we associate Datca tephra deposits with some proximal Kyra subunits of intermediate composition. However, if further geochemical (especially glass and mineral chemistry) data are provided for the Lakki and Melisserf tephra units, a more thorough tephra correlation will be possible. Finally, our results may have implications on Nisyros tephra dispersal and geochemical characterization. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Iron plays a role in nitrate drawdown by phytoplankton in Lake Erie surface waters as observed in lake-wide assessments	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Phytoplankton interactions with iron (Fe) were examined in surface waters of Lake Erie during summer thermal stratification. Lake-wide sampling in June and September 2005 was conducted using a continuous surface water sampler (1 m sampling depth) and in July at 18 hydrographic stations (5 m sampling depth). In situ measurements of photosynthetic efficiency (maximum quantum yield of photosystem II) and phytoplankton community composition were measured using fast repetition rate fluorometry and a phytoplankton pigment-specific fluorometer, respectively, during June and September. High ratios (73%-85%) of intracellular Fe to particulate Fe coincident with increases in chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations in the western and central basins in June and July imply that the majority of Fe in these regions was associated with intracellular pools. Correlations between intracellular Fe and Chl a were frequently observed when Heterokontophyta and Pyrrophyta dominated the phytoplankton community. Assimilation of Fe by the phytoplankton strongly influenced its partitioning between the dissolved and particulate phase. Dissolved iron (<0.45 mu m) concentrations were proportional to Chl a concentrations and both dissolved iron and Chl a were inversely proportional to nitrate concentrations in July and September, suggesting that dissolved iron influenced both nitrate drawdown and Chl a concentrations in Lake Erie surface waters in summer.

Building on previously detected EPEs in SES and Mongolia, we examined wave propagation patterns for two periods: 1982-98 and 1999-2019. Our analysis revealed distinct wave train configurations and geopotential anomalies preceding EPEs, with an increase in wave activity flux across the Northern Hemisphere, followed by a subsequent decrease during EPEs. Consequently, Eastern Siberia has experienced a significant rise in wave activity. Based on geopotential anomalies over Central Siberia accompanying EPEs, we identified two main types. The first, the ridge type, is predominant during the first period and features a meridional contrast with a positive geopotential (and temperature) anomaly over Central Siberia and a negative anomaly over the subtropical regions along the same longitude. The second type, termed the trough type, is more typical for the second period. It involves either a negative geopotential anomaly or the zonal proximity of positive and negative geopotential anomalies over Central Siberia. The trough type, marked by zonally oriented anomalies in geopotential and temperature, results in a more pronounced temperature decrease before EPEs and significant zonal temperature contrasts. Further, it is related to more stationary waves over Northern Eurasia, with persistent positive geopotential anomalies over Europe linked to quasi-stationary troughs over Central Siberia and positive anomalies east of Lake Baikal. Our findings align with shifts in boreal summer teleconnection patterns, reflecting significant changes in wave propagation patterns that have occurred since the late 1990s.

O2 availability and temperature seemed to regulate seasonal variations in sediment O2 uptake. Q10 values for sediment O2 uptake were 2.0-3.0 for the interval 5-10.degree. C and 1.3-1.6 for the interval 15-20.degree. C. The O2 uptake of undisturbed sediment cores sampled in late autumn and of sieved and restratified sediment was studied at temperatures from 5-20% C. At the same temperatures, these samples had an O2 uptake similar to that of samples taken monthly during the year and incubated at the in situ temperature, indicating a strong buffering capacity for sediment respiration. Freshly sedimented organic material seemed to be of minor importance in determining the seasonal changes in sediment O2 uptake. Although annual pelagic primary production was different for the 5 lakes (20-575 g C m-2 yr-1), annual O2 uptake of the sediments showed a much more restricted range (94-235 l O2 m-2 yr-1).																			0030-1299	1600-0706					1978	30	1					7	16		10.2307/3543519	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3543519													WOS:A1978FK62400002

During the early-mid Pleistocene, there was a huge lake (Songnen paleo-lake) in the Northeast China Plain. The evolutionary history and mechanism of this ancient lake need to be further studied with more boreholes. Here we present the results of "Al/"Be and paleomagnetic geochronology, magnetic susceptibility stratigraphy and rock magnetism obtained from the HL core (A borehole in Dumeng county of the Northeast China Plain). The boundary between the lacustrine sediments of Lingzi Formation and Lindian Formation was dated to be about 900 ka. The magnetic susceptibility of Lindian Formation was evidently higher than that of Lingzi Formation, and hysteresis loops and %-T curves of these representative samples show that the contribution of paramagnetic minerals and high coercivity weak magnetic minerals of Lingzi Formation was relatively large. The increase of magnetic susceptibility may be related to the decrease of lake level, the enhancement of hydrodynamic force, the increase of strong magnetic minerals entering the lake or the change of redox conditions, resulting in the formation of strong magnetic iron sulfide. At about 900 ka, the Songnen paleo-lake shrank, which may be related to the less East Asian summer monsoon precipitation. The weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and the southward movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in the tropical Pacific might be the main reason for the reduction of East Asian summer monsoon precipitation. In addition, the decreasing of the global sea level, caused by the expansion of ice sheet in high latitude, which led to more land exposure and longer transport distance of ocean water vapor, might be another cause of the East Asian summer monsoon precipitation reduction.

We tracked calcite saturation and seston composition during 1987 and 1988 in a shallow, hardwater prairie lake, 1 year before and 1 year after a lake-wide fish removal. We also measured the contribution of calcite to turbidity during 1988. 2. In both years calcite saturation increased rapidly after all ice had thawed and peaked during mid-late summer with the mineral saturation index of calcite (SI) sometimes exceeding 30. 3. Removal of calcite from lake seston by gentle acidification of unfiltered water samples showed suspended calcite to be an important source of turbidity in this lake. 4. The lake-wide fish removal produced detectable changes in the annual cycle of calcite saturation and precipitation. Increased grazing by Daphnia galeata and Daphnia pulex apparently reduced calcite saturation during early summer by suppressing the phytoplankton, and lowering the demand for CO2. 5. Lower calcite precipitation, as well as direct removal of calcite by Daphnia grazing, probably contributed to the improvement in water transparency observed after the fish kill.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	1990	24	3					547	556		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1990.tb00731.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1990.tb00731.x													WOS:A1990ET05300011

Therefore, the success of organisms inhabiting these biomes likely depends on their ability to efficiently exploit heterogeneously distributed resources. We assessed how orb-weaving spider (Larinioides patagiatus) aggregations near Lake MA 1/2 vatn, Iceland, respond to large midge (Diptera: Chironomidae) emergences that subsidize ecological communities in the surrounding landscape. The emergences occur for only a few weeks each summer, and the subsidy declines with distance from the lakeshore, producing large spatiotemporal variation in prey availability that might drive orb-weaver foraging behavior. We conducted three surveys during different phases of the summer emergence along a distance gradient to quantify variation in spider aggregation, web size, and habitat use in response to prey abundance. We found that aggregation size increased with the abundance of aerial prey, with the highest orb-weaver densities occurring at peak midge emergence. In contrast, changes in web size did not vary with midge abundance, but rather were determined by physical habitat structure. Our results illustrate how orb-weaver aggregations and web building can respond to spatiotemporal variation in resource subsidies across ecosystem boundaries.					; , Claudio/KRP-6122-2024; Ives, Anthony/A-5698-2008	Gratton, Claudio/0000-0001-6262-9670; 													0722-4060	1432-2056				AUG	2018	41	8			SI		1547	1554		10.1007/s00300-017-2202-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-017-2202-4													WOS:000441514400003
J	Hambley, GW; Lamoureux, SF				Hambley, GW; Lamoureux, SF			Recent summer climate recorded in complex varved sediments, Nicolay Lake, Cornwall Island, Nunavut, Canada	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The recent (1950-1996) varve record from the proximal sediments in Nicolay Lake, Cornwall Island, Nunavut, Canada (77 degrees 46' N, 94 degrees 40' W) contains distinct subannual rhythmites. Deposition of these subannual rhythmites is due primarily to nival snow melt, with additional sedimentary units resulting from major summer precipitation and subaqueous mass wasting events. In order to evaluate the potential hydroclimatic signal contained in the varves from the unglacierized catchment, the nival deposition record was estimated by delineating the initial subannual rhythmite within each varve. When the record is split into temporal segments based on two phases that exhibit different sediment deposition patterns in the lake, the nival rhythmites are significantly correlated to annual cumulative melting degree days (MDD) from the nearest weather station Isachsen (78 degrees 47' N, 103 degrees 32' W) (1950-1962 AD and 1963-1977 AD with r = 0.55 and r = 0.82, respectively). A similar analysis with data from Resolute (74 degrees 43' N, 94 degrees 59' W) yields slightly weaker correlations (1950-1962 AD, r = 0.60; 1963-1994, r = 0.59). The strong positive correlation with both the Isachsen and Resolute thermal records suggests that the paleoclimatic signal in the sediments reflects regional climate conditions. Notably, the signal is strongest when the entire melt season is considered; weaker correlations with instrumental weather records are associated with comparisons limited to the peak melt or early season melt periods. We attribute this to the ongoing supply of snowmelt through the season in this polar region and the availability of sediment for transport throughout the melt season. These results indicate that a high resolution hydroclimatic signal is present in the sediments from Nicolay Lake and can be used for paleoclimate reconstruction provided sedimentary depositional controls are taken into account.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2006	35	3					629	640		10.1007/s10933-005-4302-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-005-4302-3													WOS:000236090300011
J	Bergelson, G; Nativ, R; Bein, A				Bergelson, G; Nativ, R; Bein, A			Salinization and dilution history of ground water discharging into the Sea of Galilee, the Dead Sea Transform, Israel	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The mechanism governing salinization of ground water discharging into the Sea of Galilee in Israel has been the subject of debate for several decades. Because the lake provides 25% of the water consumed annually in Israel, correct identification of the salt sources is essential for the establishment of suitable water-management strategies for the lake and the ground water in the surrounding aquifers. Existing salinization models were evaluated in light of available and newly acquired data including general chemistry, and O, H, C and Cl isotopes. Based on the chemical and isotopic observations, the proposed salt source is an ancient, intensively evaporated brine (21- to 33-fold seawater) which percolated through the valley formations from a lake which had formed in the Rift Valley following seawater intrusion during the late Miocene. Low Na:CI and high Br:CI values support the extensive evaporation, whereas high Ca:CI and low Mg:CI values indicate the impact of dolomitization of the carbonate host rock on the residual solution. Based on radiocarbon and other isotope data, the dilution of the original brine occurred in two stages: the first took place similar to 30 000 a ago by slightly evaporated fresh-to-brackish lake water to form the Sea of Galilee Brine. The second dilution phase is associated with the current hydrological regime as the Sea of Galilee Brine migrates upward along the Rift faults and mixes with the actively circulating fresh ground water to form the saline springs. The spatially variable chemical and isotopic features of the saline springs suggest not only differential dilution by fresh meteoric water, but also differential percolation timing of the original brine into the tectonically disconnected blocks, registering different evaporation stages in the original brine. Consequently, various operations to reduce the brine contribution to the lake may be differentially effective in the various areas. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Kieniewicz, JM; Smith, JR				Kieniewicz, Johanna M.; Smith, Jennifer R.			Paleoenvironmental reconstruction and water balance of a mid-Pleistocene pluvial lake, Dakhleh Oasis, Egypt	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Mid-Pleistocene lacustrine sediments exposed as erosional remnants in Dakhleh Oasis in the Western Desert of Egypt provide evidence for a more humid climate than that which persists today. The sediments range in facies from palustrine to fully lacustrine and generally reflect an increase in water depth upward through the strata. Ironstone spring deposits associated with the lacustrine sediments and modern artesian discharge in the oasis indicate that Nubian aquifer water was probably an important component of the water balance, but the high carbonate content of the lake sediments requires the input of surface drainage derived from the nearby limestone-capped Libyan Plateau. Although definitive shorelines have not been observed, a maximum lake size of 1735 km(2) is derived from extrapolation of the elevations of the deposits onto the modern deflated topography. Theoretical water balance modeling suggests that in addition to the discharge derived from the Nubian aquifer, similar to 410-860 mm/yr of rainfall would be required over the Dakhleh Oasis drainage basin in order to maintain the lake at hydrologic steady state. The persistence of climatic and hydrologic conditions amenable to maintaining a shallow freshwater lake would have allowed the region to be inhabited by a savanna fauna, as well as early human groups.																			0016-7606	1943-2674				JUN	2009	121	7-8					1154	1171		10.1130/B26301.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B26301.1													WOS:000267393800011

This study was conducted on shallow, urban Lake Mielenko (Maximum depth 1.9 m; Mean depth 1.3 m) in the context of implementing a new, sustainable method of lake restoration, i.e., phosphorus inactivation by sequential application of two types of coagulants. Approximately 9.9 tons of polyaluminium chloride (trade name PAX 18) were introduced into the profundal zone of Lake Mielenko, and 9.0 tons of iron chloride (trade name PIX 111) in the coastal area. The applications were divided into two spring and two autumn stages. Before restoration, the mean Pmin. concentration in Lake Mielenko water was 0.031 mg P/L, and TP was in the range of 0.091 to 0.346 mg P/L. After restoration, the average content of Pmin. was 0.007 mg P/L (a decrease of 80%), and the average value of TP was 0.096 mg P/L (a decrease of 72%). The obtained results indicate that phosphorus inactivation does not change nitrogen compounds' content. However, due to the application of coagulants, P content decreased, i.e., the main factor limiting photosynthesis, which resulted in a significant decrease in primary production in Lake Mielenko. Before restoration, the average content of N-NH4 was 0.100 mg N/L, N-NO3-0.145 mg N/L, Norg. 1.70 mg N/L, and TN-1.86 mg N/L. After restoration, the average content of N-NH4 was 0.096 mg N/L, N-NO3-0.123 mg N/L, Norg. 1.28 mg N/L, and TN-1.50 mg N/L. This also resulted in a reduction in the Norg. content, as well as a reduction in the amount of chlorophyll a (from 30.51 to 13.41 mg/m3), organic compounds (BOD5 from 8.9 to 4.6 mg O2/L), and an increase in water transparency to the bottom (up to 1.45 m on average). The results obtained in Lake Mielenko indicate that the innovative method of phosphorus inactivation, which involves the sequential application of two types of phosphorus-binding preparations, is an excellent solution that ensures higher ecological safety in the coastal areas of the reservoir and also allows for a significant reduction in restoration costs.					; Augustyniak, Renata/AAY-3672-2021	Lopata, Michal/0000-0002-1993-3287; Augustyniak-Tunowska, Renata/0000-0003-0098-0427; Grochowska, Jolanta/0000-0001-7319-4174; Tandyrak, Renata/0000-0001-6767-6572														2071-1050				DEC	2023	15	23							16346	10.3390/su152316346	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su152316346													WOS:001116185700001

Agricultural impacts on lake and stream water quality in Grand Lake St. Marys, western Ohio	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Agricultural activities release variable products into air, soil and water ecosystems. The study was conducted to evaluate the impact of agriculture and concentrated livestock operations on stream and lake water quality in Grand Lake St. Marys watershed of north- western Ohio. Temporal water samples from the lake and the 6 feeding streams were collected bimonthly from January 2005 to May 2007, processed and measured for temperature, turbidity, pH, electrical conductivity (E(C)), ammonium (NH(4)(+)), nitrate (NO(3)(-)), dissolved phosphorus (P), ultra-violet (UV) light absorption, and dissolved oxygen (DO), employing standard methods of analysis. The measured data were normalized and integrated into a simple index (WQ(Index)) to evaluate overall water quality. Results showed that over 90% of the area in the watershed was under cropland with associated livestock operations. With a land area equal to 195 km(2) represented by the six major tributaries, the average animal density was over 240 units km(-2). As a result, land disposal of manure from confined feedings operations and direct deposit by grazing animals contributed to non-point sources of water pollution. While (NH(4)(+)) and P concentration, turbidity, and UV absorption peaked during the summer, the (NO(3)(-)) and DO concentration in both stream and lake water was lowest in the summer. Water sampled from the Coldwater, Beaver and Prairie creeks had higher turbidity, (NH(4)(+)), and P than other creeks. However, DO concentration and UV absorption of water did not change significantly by the influence of streams. The WQIndex peaked in both streams and lake water with greater water quality degradation in Beaver and Coldwater creek than other creeks. A significant relationship of WQIndex with UV absorption and P accounted 84 to 90% of the variations in stream and lake water quality degradation. However, a strong linear relationship (r(2) = 0.81; p< 0.01) between UV absorption and P concentration suggested a major contribution of P to the degradation of stream and lake water quality through algal blooming and associated eutrophication.

The chronology of the record was constrained by five AMS C-14 ages. The carbon isotope (delta C-13) and Total Organic Carbon (TOC) data highly variable which vary between -26.62 parts per thousand and -22.46 parts per thousand (C-3-plants) and 0.1-similar to 4%, respectively, indicating paleo-vegetation history and productivity of the studied area. The environmental magnetism is highly fluctuating in the Early Holocene with high concentrations of magnetic minerals during the high monsoon conditions and vice-versa. Intense Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) phases were identified during the Early and Late Holocene i.e., similar to 9.2 to 7.4 ka, and similar to 4.8 ka to Modern which shows warm and wet climate. While decline in the ISM intensity during similar to 7.4 to 4.8 ka which indicates cold and dry climatic condition in the Northwest Himalayan regions. From similar to 9.2 to 7.4 ka, highly fluctuating climate linked with the Early Holocene warming. Sediment profile exhibits aridity in climate accompanying with the high influence of mid-latitude westerlies during similar to 7.4 to 4.8 ka from Northwest Indian regions. Hence the longterm fluctuation in the climate governed by the changes in the North Atlantic Ocean circulation as well as variations in the incoming solar radiations.

The grain-size distributions measured in this study were classified into three statistical end-members that may be connected to clastic material inputs from a variety of sources and transport processes. Among these, the EM3 fraction (modal grain size of similar to 138 mu m) was suggested to indicate the aeolian activity history in the central Tibetan Plateau. The results indicate that the aeolian activity in this region occurred under dry and cold conditions since 3,900 cal yr BP, with three strong aeolian activity intervals at 3,200-2,900 cal yr BP, 2,400-1,400 cal yr BP, and after 130 cal yr BP. Comparison with other records showed that solar insolation, weakening Indian summer monsoon, and the strengthening westerlies have a direct relationship with the aeolian activity in the central Tibetan Plateau. We therefore suggest that the atmospheric circulation patterns and effective humidity may have a strong impact on the water balance and weathering intensity in the arid and semiarid areas, hence affecting dust emissions. Also, the coarse detrital end-member fraction of lake sediments is suggested as a potential aeolian activity proxy.

J	Lehtonen, KK; Andersin, AB				Lehtonen, KK; Andersin, AB			Population dynamics, response to sedimentation and role in benthic metabolism of the amphipod Monoporeia affinis in an open-sea area of the northern Baltic Sea	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												0Population dynamics of the benthic, deposit-feeding amphipod Monoporeia affinis was studied over 3 spring bloom periods (1991 to 1993) at a deep (125 m), northern Baltic (Bothnian Sea) open-sea station. Simultaneously recorded sedimentation data (1991 and 1993) were used to investigate pelagic-benthic coupling that is believed to regulate the growth of the amphipod population. Growth of individuals and population biomass both showed a distinct response to the sedimentation of the spring bloom after, approximately, a 4 wk time lag. Thus, the dynamics of the amphipod population seems to be tightly coupled to the autochthonous food source. Using parallel metabolic and body composition data, the instantaneous and annual requirements of carbon and nitrogen (production, respiration and nitrogen excretion) of the population were calculated. The results showed that the role of the amphipod population in benthic mineralization of organic matter is probably highly significant in the study area. Moreover, the results implied that local primary production and the measured sedimentation rates at the location cannot provide the benthos with sufficient food. This suggests that resuspension and the lateral transport of organic particulates from adjacent sea areas play a critical role in supporting the amphipod population in the study area. In addition to strong seasonal variability in growth of the amphipods, marked interannual variability was observed in the other population parameters measured. Biomass, density and annual production rates of the population all-showed a marked decreasing trend during the study period. Marked interannual variation in the recruitment success (survival of the offspring) of the different annual cohorts also seemed to show density- and/or nutrition-dependency. This study also corroborates previously recorded long-term fluctuations (ca 7 yr cycle) in amphipod populations in the Bothnian Sea and reveals the possible factors causing these fluctuations.

The study aimed to comprehensively characterize selected pollutants in a non-flowing reservoir with a residual forest catchment area and a high tourism impact.Materials and methodsFour times a year, representative of each season, water and bottom sediment samples were collected along the large axis of the studied reservoir. Environmental samples were analyzed for the concentration of selected phthalates including dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP) and bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate (DEHA) by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Moreover, the temperature, oxygen concentration, pH, electrical conductivity, chemical oxygen demand, and concentration of total, inorganic, and total organic carbon were measured in the waters. In the bottom sediments, pH, redox potential, dry mass, dry organic mass, and dry mineral mass were measured.Results and discussionThe sum of tested compounds in the water ranged from 3.59 mu g L- 1 to 68.6 mu g L- 1, while in bottom sediments from 338 mu g kg (dry mass: DM)-1 to 1170 mu g kgDM- 1. Different seasonal variability was observed, with the highest concentrations of total plasticizers in winter and spring, in water and sediments respectively. Spatial variability studies have shown an increase in the sum concentration of phthalates and adipate in the reservoir water along the large axis of the reservoir and similar distribution of congeners in sediments. In turn, spatial variability in the water column indicated no significant differences in the concentrations of the tested compounds, probably due to the reservoir's small depth and the mixing of water masses. DBP and DEHP dominated the sediments.ConclusionsThe lack of surface water inflow to the Nak & lstrok;o-Chech & lstrok;o reservoir and the residual forest catchment most likely have a decisive effect on the level and distribution of the tested pollutants in the reservoir. Atmospheric deposition, increased tourist activity in the reservoir area, and consequently, the quality of surface runoff also affect the concentrations and spatial distributions of the plasticizers.

Warming of Central European lakes and their response to the 1980s climate regime shift	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Lake surface water temperatures (LSWTs) are sensitive to atmospheric warming and have previously been shown to respond to regional changes in the climate. Using a combination of in situ and simulated surface temperatures from 20 Central European lakes, with data spanning between 50 and similar to 100 years, we investigate the long-term increase in annually averaged LSWT. We demonstrate that Central European lakes are warming most in spring and experience a seasonal variation in LSWT trends. We calculate significant LSWT warming during the past few decades and illustrate, using a sequential t test analysis of regime shifts, a substantial increase in annually averaged LSWT during the late 1980s, in response to an abrupt shift in the climate. Surface air temperature measurements from 122 meteorological stations situated throughout Central Europe demonstrate similar increases at this time. Climatic modification of LSWT has numerous consequences for water quality and lake ecosystems. Quantifying the response of LSWT increase to large-scale and abrupt climatic shifts is essential to understand how lakes will respond in the future.					; Dokulil, Martin/J-3464-2019; Merchant, Christopher/KHY-0611-2024; Schmid, Martin/C-3953-2009; Marszelewski, Wlodzimierz/D-4630-2014	Woolway, Richard Iestyn/0000-0003-0498-7968; Dokulil, Martin/0000-0002-6369-1457; Schmid, Martin/0000-0001-8699-5691; Bouffard, Damien/0000-0002-2005-9718													0165-0009	1573-1480				JUN	2017	142	3-4					505	520		10.1007/s10584-017-1966-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-017-1966-4													WOS:000401452700015

With climate warming, complex changes in fish community structure may be expected owing to the direct and indirect effects of temperature, and indirect effects of eutrophication, water-level changes and salinisation on fish metabolism, biotic interactions and geographical distribution. We review published and new data supporting the hypotheses that, with a warming climate, there will be changes in: fish community structure (e.g. higher or lower richness depending on local conditions); life history traits (e.g. smaller body size, shorter life span, earlier and less synchronised reproduction); feeding mode (i.e. increased omnivory and herbivory); behaviour (i.e. stronger association with littoral areas and a greater proportion of benthivores); and winter survival. All these changes imply higher predation on zooplankton and macroinvertebrates with increasing temperatures, suggesting that the changes in the fish communities partly resemble, and may intensify, the effects triggered by eutrophication. Modulating factors identified in cold and temperate systems, such as the presence of submerged plants and winter ice cover, seem to be weaker or non-existent in warm(ing) lakes. Consequently, in the future lower nutrient thresholds may be needed to obtain clear-water conditions and good ecological status in the future in currently cold or temperate lakes. Although examples are still scarce and more research is needed, we foresee biomanipulation to be a less successful restoration tool in warm(ing) lakes without a strong reduction of the nutrient load.

J	Wu, HB; Wang, NL; Guo, ZM; Wu, YW				Wu, Hongbo; Wang, Ninglian; Guo, Zhongming; Wu, Yuwei			Regional glacier mass loss estimated by ICESat-GLAS data and SRTM digital elevation model in the West Kunlun Mountains, Tibetan Plateau, 2003-2009	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												The Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) altimetry and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) data are used to estimate glacier mass loss changes in the West Kunlun Mountains, Tibetan Plateau (TP), 2003 to 2009. We integrated Landsat thematic mapper (TM)/enhanced TM images and GIS spatial analysis to map glacier surface elevation changes during 2003 to 2009. The ICESat-GLAS data can be used as baselines for surface elevation changes in altimetry as well as for TM imagery changes for depicting glacier area. Least-squares regression of an ICESat-derived thickness series shows the regional glacier mass decreased at an average rate of 1.41 +/- 0.23 km(3)/year water equivalent from 2003 to 2009, during the period of 2003 to 2009, the trend in thickness change became weaker. The ICESat-GLAS and SRTM DEM elevation differences between February 2003 and October 2009 show that the glacier surface elevations were decreasing below 5800 m but increased by 1.1 +/- 0.7 m above 6000 m a.s.l. region over that period. Thickness changes in the lower reaches of the glaciers indicate that the glacier ice ablation was mainly due to the summer temperature increases of 0.23 degrees C and the summer precipitation decreases of 47.8 mm as measured at four stations, as well as the effects of sand and dust sources from the Tarim Basin. Meanwhile, in the upper parts of the glaciers (above 5800 m a.s.l.), ice surface elevation was increasing even though the Hetian station summer temperature at the 500 hPa level showed an obvious decrease of 0.78 degrees C compared to 2003. In the upper part of the glacier-covered region, firn compaction and surface density should be taken into account. The glacier surges and bedrock movement may also lead to an underestimate of the volume loss due to the reduced mass conversion.

J	RAMAIAH, N				RAMAIAH, N			SUMMER ABUNDANCE AND ACTIVITIES OF BACTERIA IN THE FRESH-WATER LAKES OF SCHIRMACHER-OASIS, ANTARCTICA	POLAR BIOLOGY												Bacterial biomass and heterotrophic potential (using C-14-labeled glucose, glutamic acid and sodium acetate) of water, ice and sediment microbial populations were studied from different lakes of the Schirmacher Oasis, Antarctica. Epifluorescence counts of total bacteria in these lakes were observed to be lower by a factor when compared to some of the ultraoligotrophic Antarctic lakes. Biovolumes of bacteria from different samples did not show significant variations, suggesting that regulatory factors were oligotrophy and low temperatures rather than microzoan grazing. Microbial uptake rates of glutamic acid were generally the fastest, followed by glucose and/or sodium acetate in the lakewater samples. The mean values of V-max cell(-1) for glutamic acid, sodium acetate and glucose were 3.81, 0.91 and 0.71 pg C h(-1). Results of this study are potentially useful in recognizing the relative abundance and activity of limnetic microbial populations in the Schirmacher Oasis during summer - the active period of microbial growth - and for comparing their activities with other ecosystems elsewhere in continental Antarctica.																			0722-4060					SEP	1995	15	8					547	553		10.1007/BF00239646	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00239646													WOS:A1995TB80900003

The results show that the delta(37)Cl values of the waters taken before 1984 were at around-0.12 parts per thousand, whereas those after 1984 were at around +0.18 parts per thousand. The delta(37)Cl values are thus distinct across 1984, which is consistent with the classification by the Cl to S molar ratio (Cl/S): the higher the Cl/S ratio, the larger the delta(37)Cl value. The delta(37)Cl value increased as much as 0.30 parts per thousand during 5 years between 1980 and 1984. This isotopic enrichment is likely correlated with increasing Cl/S ratios, suggesting that the heavier isotope ((37)Cl) may have preferentially increased in the original Cl source of the hot spring across 1984 when volcanic activity likely increased at Mt Kusatsu-Shirane.

Examination of direct daytime predation by Coregonus artedi on Bythotrephes longimanus in Harp Lake, Ontario, Canada: no evidence for the refuge hypothesis	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Since its introduction to Harp Lake, Ontario, Canada, summer abundance of the cladoceran zooplanktivore Bythotrephes longimanus has fluctuated substantially both among and within years. The principal planktivorous fish in Harp Lake is the cold-water Coregonus artedi (cisco). Previous studies hypothesized that Bythotrephes abundance was affected by the thickness of an ephemeral, dark, daytime refuge from cisco that potentially established at the bottom of the metalimnion. During summer of 2003, we estimated peak daytime refuge thickness by simulating light energy visible to cisco and found it was always negative and did not correlate with Bythotrephes death rates. Direct observations using gill-netting and acoustical methods suggested that cisco had frequent metalimnetic forays. Additionally, including years 2000-2004, the previous correlation between mean Bythotrephes abundance and refuge thickness no longer held. The refuge hypothesis appears to fail, as the amount of metalimnetic illumination was always above the level at which cisco reaction distance to prey is maximal. Selection of Bythotrephes by cisco instead appeared to increase once Bythotrephes became abundant, remaining consistent and nontrivial even after Bythotrephes population declined.					; Yan, Norman/H-5235-2013	Yan, Norman/0000-0003-4870-6865; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				MAR	2009	66	3					449	459		10.1139/F09-006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F09-006													WOS:000264957700009

Sixteen lakes were sampled during austral summers 2001/02, 2003/04, 2004/05 and 2005/06 to assess temporal variation in water chemistry. Although samples showed a wide range in ion concentrations, their composition mainly reflected that of seawater. In general, as the distance from the sea increased, the input of elements from the marine environment (through aerosols and seabirds) decreased and there was an increase in nitrate and sulfate concentrations. Antarctic lakes lack outflows and during the austral summer the melting and/or ablation of ice cover, water evaporation and leaching processes in dry soils determine a progressive increase in water ion concentrations. During the five-year monitoring survey, no statistically significant variation in the water chemistry were detected, except for a slight (hardly significant) increase in TN concentrations. However, Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) indicated that other factors besides distance from the sea, the presence of nesting seabirds, the sampling time and percentage of ice cover affect the composition of water in Antarctic cold desert environments.

LACUSTRINE CARBONATES FROM LAKE TURKANA, KENYA: A DEPOSITIONAL MODEL OF CARBONATES IN AN EXTENSIONAL BASIN	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												Lake Turkana, northern Kenya, serves as a long-lived end-member extensional basin that preserves a volcanically mediated, mixed siliciclastic and carbonate system. Stratigraphic data from the southeastern margin of Lake Turkana reveal a suite of carbonate facies assemblages. Lithologies of this system include mudstone, siltstone, sandstone, conglomerate, diatomite, carbonate mudstone, wackestone, grainstone, packstone, and boundstone. The boundstones are subdivided into framestones (stromatolites or oncoids) and display upward growth from a nucleus where found in association with cobbles and shells and bindstones (laminar tufa) where not. Three discrete, large (up to 7.5 m high), stacked, mounded boundstones are interpreted as subaerial spring deposits based upon overall shape, surficial texture, and orientation with respect to mapped faults and the distribution of modern springs. Petrographic analysis reveals peloids, ostracods, microbial sheaths, gastropods, pelecypods, diatoms, and detrital grains that include quartz, volcanic glass, and volcanic lithic fragments. All grains are micritized, and fossils tend not to retain their original microstructure. Some lithologies have porosities as high as 39%, and permeability averages 4 ml) as a result of the dominance of moldic porosity and microporosity. The combination of lithologic data and facies associations is combined to produce a depositional model that is useful for comparison with ancient rift basins that host economic quantities of hydrocarbons. The controlling factors for carbonate development in Lake Turkana include the structural framework, water depth, and lake chemistry.																			1527-1404	1938-3681				MAR-APR	2014	84	3-4					224	237		10.2110/jsr.2014.22	http://dx.doi.org/10.2110/jsr.2014.22													WOS:000336948300006

In this context, we established a high-resolution 7.4 cal ka paleohydrological record from Shireet Naiman Nuur in the central Mongolian Khangai Mountains using compound-specific biomarker 82H analyses. Our results suggest that drier conditions from 7.4 to 3.6 cal ka BP and wetter conditions since 3.6 cal ka BP until present are indeed related to changes in atmospheric circulation pattern. A strong anti-phasing between our record and records in monsoonal Asia shows that ASM intensification during the Mid Holocene shifted the ASM limit and adjacent subsidence dry-zones northwards, leading to increased dryness at Shireet Naiman Nuur. Overall wetter conditions during the Late Holocene are related to negative North Atlantic Oscillation phases advecting moisture into central Mongolia and Shireet Naiman Nuur by southerly-displaced Westerlies. & COPY; 2023 The Authors.

Total area is about 2000 ha, of which 10% is made up by salt lakes. The main freshwater resources at Rottnest Island are the two shallow unconfined aquifers known as Oliver Hill and Wadjemup mounds. These aquifers may feed freshwater seepages along swamps and lake edges for many island faunas that are dependent on freshwater. The freshwater seepage flow to the salt lakes primarily depends on the hydraulic gradient of water table but currently it is unknown at Rottnest Island. This study investigates the freshwater seepage flow to the salt lakes and its quality for the use of island's fauna. Two seepage meters were designed based on Lee (1977) and Brodie et al. (2009) by cutting a drum into two pieces and installed in the margins of two selected lakes-Lake Baghdad and Lake Negri. These two sites were chosen because of numerous visits of the animals and birds and close proximity to the Wadjemup aquifer. The visit of animals was ensured from their footprints and poos. Several site visits were made during the wet period (June-September) of 2012 for water sampling from the seepage meter, lake water and nearby piezometer. This time was selected because of winter/rainy season of the year when the seepage water is prominent in the margin of the salt lakes. The water samples from seepage meter, respective lakes and nearby groundwater was collected and measured for different water quality parameters such as, electrical conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, total nitrogen and total phosphate. The average seepage flow to Lake Baghdad (204 ml. m(-2). min(-1)) was found much higher than Lake Negri (8.95 ml. m(-2). min(-1)). This may be because of some preferential flow to Lake Baghdad which was also confirmed from visible seeps. Water quality parameters revealed that the pH is within the range of drinking water quality standard and dissolved oxygen of groundwater was found lower than the lake water. But all other parameters fall above the standard values. The salinity effect may be due to hypersaline salt lakes and the sea-water intrusion and the nutrients are found higher because of vegetative waste and fauna poos near the salt lakes where the freshwater seeps are available.

TEM (transmission electron microscopy) results indicate that BC from combustion sources shows various patterns, and airborne BC appears spherical and about 50 nm in diameter with a homogeneous surface and turbostratic structure. The BET (Barrett-Emmett-Teller) results suggest that the surface areas of these BC particles fall in the range of 3-23 m(2)/g, with a total pore volume of 0.03-0.05 cm(3)/g and a mean pore diameter of 7-53 nm. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms are indicative of the accumulation mode and uniform pore size. O-2-TPO (temperature programmed oxidation) profiles suggest that the airborne BC oxidation could be classified as the oxidation of amorphous carbon, which falls in the range of 406-490 degrees C with peaks at 418, 423 and 475 degrees C, respectively. Generally, the BC characteristics and source analysis suggest that airborne BC most likely comes from diesel vehicle emission at this site.

J	Vucetich, JA; Peterson, RO				Vucetich, JA; Peterson, RO			The influence of top-down, bottom-up and abiotic factors on the moose (Alces alces) population of Isle Royale	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Long-term, concurrent measurement of population dynamics and associated top-down and bottom-up processes are rare for unmanipulated, terrestrial systems. Here, we analyse populations of moose, their predators (wolves, Canis lupus), their primary winter forage (balsam fir, Abies balsamea) and several climatic variables that were monitored for 40 consecutive years in Isle Royale National Park (544 km(2)), Lake Superior, USA. We judged the relative importance of top-down, bottom-up and abiotic factors on moose population growth rate by constructing multiple linear regression models, and calculating the proportion of interannual variation in moose population growth rate explained by each factor. Our analysis indicates that more variation in population growth rate is explained by bottom-up than top-down processes, and abiotic factors explain more variation than do bottom-up processes. Surprisingly, winter precipitation did not explain any significant variation in population growth rate. Like that detected for two Norwegian ungulate populations, the relationship between population growth rate and the North Atlantic Oscillation was nonlinear. Although this analysis provides significant insight, much remains unknown: of the models examined, the most parsimonious explain little more than half the variation in moose population growth rate.																			0962-8452	1471-2954				JAN 22	2004	271	1535					183	189		10.1098/rspb.2003.2589	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2003.2589								15058396					WOS:000188171300011

The Willyama Supergroup is interpreted as a sequence of intracontinental rift sediments, volcanics, and hot spring precipitates. Scheelite occurs in regional calc-silicate rocks enriched in F and Zn within a sequence of carbonaceous-sulfidic metapelite, tourmalinite, and amphibolite; it overlies a felsic gneiss-metasediment sequence, part of which is interpreted as meta-evaporites. The distribution of scheelite is unrelated to syntectonic pegmatite or post-tectonic granitic rocks. Finally, scheelite has undergone minor remobilization during tectonism. The calc-silicate rocks are interpreted as dolomitic limey sediment which formed part of a playa-lake sequence into which B-, W-, Zn-, and F-rich alkaline hot springs debouched. Coeval sudden deepening, an increased geothermal gradient, deposition of the Broken Hill Pb-Zn-Ag sulfide orebodies, and siliceous exhalite deposition occurred after deposition of the evaporite sequence. Some components for the highly saline Broken Hill Pb-Zn-Ag ore fluid may have been leached from the underlying evaporites and redeposited higher in the stratigraphy.																			0361-0128					MAY	1994	89	3					423	437		10.2113/gsecongeo.89.3.423	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gsecongeo.89.3.423													WOS:A1994NU19700001

Woody detritus inputs in a mesic deciduous forest in Tennessee were followed from 1976 to 1988. Annual inputs were highly variable with a mean of 3.97 Mg ha-1 yr-1, with a range from 0.55 to 16.00 Mg ha-1 yr-1. The woody detritus pool in 1989 was 19.26 Mg ha-1. The stand-level decomposition constant, based on the input/biomass ratio, was 0.21 yr-1 for a half-life of 3.4 years. The decomposition of 14 standing dead and 39 fallen boles of known age since death was also examined. The decomposition rate constant based on a single-exponential decay model was 0.110 yr-1, with a half-life of 6.3 years, for fallen logs and 0.062 yr-1, with a half-life of 11.2 years, for standing dead boles. Detrital turnover is thus rapid and woody debris is not a long-term energy and nutrient sink in this forest.																			0040-9618					JAN-MAR	1991	118	1					52	57		10.2307/2996975	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2996975													WOS:A1991FB95000008
J	Huang, QF; Li, N; Li, Y				Huang, Qunfang; Li, Na; Li, Yuan			Long-term trend of heat waves and potential effects on phytoplankton blooms in Lake Qiandaohu, a key drinking water reservoir	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Global warming is increasing the frequency and duration of heat waves, which is defined as when air temperature exceeds a threshold for more than specific consecutive days. Ecosystem around the globe will be impaired by heat waves just like the exposures to dangerously high temperatures as a public health threat to human. However, the knowledge of the response of lake and reservoir ecosystem to heat waves is largely unknown although it has been argued that climate warming may increase the incidence of harmful algal blooms. We examined the long-term trend of heat waves and how the variability of phytoplankton biomass responds to lake heat waves on a deep reservoir (Lake Qiandaohu). Long-term (1980-2020) meteorological observation in the lake watershed showed a significant warming trend of 0.36 degrees C per decade for the yearly average of daily average air temperature and the yearly average of daily maximum air temperature of 18.32 degrees C was observed in 2016. Meanwhile, a significant increasing number of heat wave events lasting longer was observed, and Lake Qiandaohu suffered an unusually severe lake heat wave in summer 2016. Significant correlations were found between the yearly average of daily maximum air temperature and heat days, heat wave events, and heat wave days. Nuisance phytoplankton bloom was found in Lake Qiandaohu by high frequency observation and remote sensing monitoring in summer 2016. Remote sensing estimation from two Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images showed that the average chlorophyll a (Chla) was 7.45 +/- 4.89 mu g/L on July 18 before heat wave and 18.96 +/- 0.98 mu g/L on August 19 during the heat wave. Two heat wave events lasting from July 20 to August 2 and August 11 to 26 with average surface water temperature of 29.93 and 31.99 degrees C promoted two marked phytoplankton blooms with average Chla concentrations of 11.75 +/- 4.08 and 10.53 +/- 1.65 mu g/L in the central lake region, respectively, as evidenced by high-frequency buoy data. These findings suggest that heat waves are likely to yield an increased threat of harmful algal bloom in freshwater ecosystems. With lake heat waves projected to increase in frequency, duration, and spatial extent with global climate change, more studies are needed to improve our understanding of lake heat waves and their potential effects on the species, communities, frequency of phytoplankton bloom, and also help providing advanced schemes of water quality management.					; Li, Na/OGQ-8410-2025	Li, Yuan/0000-0003-0381-2605; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2021	28	48					68448	68459		10.1007/s11356-021-15414-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-15414-z		JUL 2021						34272668					WOS:000673205200013

Here, we reconstructed climatic and hydrological variability in the southwestern Tibetan Plateau since the LGM using climate proxies based on molecular distributions of n-alkanes, hydrogen (SD) and carbon (S13C) isotopic compositions of terrestrial n-alkanes from sediments, and oxygen isotopic composition (S18O) of authigenic carbonate at Lake Zabuye. The impact of climatic and environmental factors on these multiple proxies was discussed, and the TraCE-21 ka simulation was employed to facilitate a comprehensive model-data comparison. Our findings indicate that the SD of nC31 alkane in this lake was primarily influenced by temperature from the LGM to early deglaciation period, shifting to a predominance of precipitation influence from the Heinrich event 1 (H1) to the Holocene period. In contrast, the carbonate S18O was found to be primarily governed by evaporative processes. Through comprehensive analysis of all proxies, we suggest that Lake Zabuye was dominated by the mid-latitude westerlies with cold and moist conditions from the LGM to early deglaciation. The H1 and Younger Dryas events were characterized by low temperatures and reduced precipitation due to the influence of the moderately intensified westerlies. The Indian summer monsoon (ISM) intensified during the B & oslash;lling/Aller & oslash;d period, and its strength was comparable to that of the westerlies, resulting in plentiful rainfall and high evaporation. The ISM was dominant during the Holocene, characterized by abundant rainfall and high evaporation.					; Tian, Lijun/KPB-4331-2024; Cheng, Jun/G-4625-2013	Tian, Lijun/0000-0003-3772-2835; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				APR 15	2025	664								112809	10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.112809	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.112809		FEB 2025											WOS:001428279800001
J	Real, M; Rieradevall, M; Prat, N				Real, M; Rieradevall, M; Prat, N			Chironomus species (Diptera: Chironomidae) in the profundal benthos of Spanish reservoirs and lakes: factors affecting distribution patterns	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The taxonomy, distribution and habitat preferences of Chironomus larvae from profundal benthos of reservoirs and natural lakes in Spain are presented. The 114 water bodies studied were medium to large reservoirs and lakes throughout Spain, and were visited on at least two occasions (summer and winter). Out of the natural lakes investigated, Chironomus larvae were found only in one karstic lake (Banyoles), and to date, these have not been found in the high mountain lakes of the Spanish Pyrenees or Sierra Nevada, or in Spain's largest oligotrophic lake (Sanabria). 2. Multiple regression with environmental data from reservoirs showed that the density of Chironomus larvae was inversely correlated with water depth, temperature and sulphide content of the bottom water, but positively correlated with alkalinity and particulate organic nitrogen (PON) content of bottom water. Thus, the density of Chironomus larvae was higher in shallow reservoirs from the eastern part of Spain (calcareous water and higher PON), but markedly lower in southern reservoirs (higher temperature and higher sulphide). 3. According to morphological and cytological characteristics, three species of this genus have been identified in the samples examined: C. bernensis, C. plumosus and C. nuditarsis. Reasons for the absence of other widespread European species are discussed. 4. Using canonical correspondence analysis to relate species and environmental variables, C. bernensis showed a significant preference for reservoirs with higher oxygen concentrations in bottom water and lower total reactive phosphorus (TRP) content at the surface than those reservoirs where C. plumosus-type were found. This suggests that the smaller C. bernensis prefers mesotrophic reservoirs and the larger C. plumosus-type (C. plumosus + C. nuditarsis) prefers eutrophic reservoirs. Taking into account the TRP/depth index for those samples collected at depths below the thermocline, and thus, where oxygen can be a limiting factor, C. bernensis and C. nuditarsis were present in reservoirs in which the index was low (< 1:170 for C. bernensis and > 1:800 for C. nuditarsis), while C. plumosus thrived in reservoirs with higher index values (< 1:20). These differences may reflect the preference of C. bernensis and C. nuditarsis for detrital material, while C. plumosus prefers phytoplankton. These observations are in agreement with the depth distribution of each species: C. plumosus was restricted to reservoirs less than 46 m deep, whereas the other two species (i.e. C. bernensis and C. nuditarsis) were found up to depths of 65 and 80 m, respectively. 5. Data from a transect (5-20 m deep) in Lake Banyoles are consistent with the general pattern described in reservoirs. In this lake, a high density of C. bernensis was recorded from littoral and sublittoral areas with abundant oxygen (above or close to the thermocline), whereas C. plumosus was scarce in several parts of the lake, especially in oxygen-deficient areas during the summer. This karstic, oligotrophic lake has a low TRP/depth index, and therefore, we expected C. bernensis to be dominant in the littoral, as is the case. Nevertheless, the severe depletion of oxygen caused by meromixis, and the high hydrogen sulphide concentration benefit C. plumosus in deeper zones. Chironomus nuditarsis was scarce in Lake Banyoles and only found at considerable depths.

Employing the sedimentology, geochemistry, and chronology supported by statistical analysis, four major phases of strengthened and weakened monsoon conditions are inferred. The pattern of geochemical variability during Phase-I (13.6 ka and 12.7 ka) indicates a relatively wetter condition (improved ISM); following this, during phase-II (11.9 ka and 11.1 ka), the ISM strength weakened. However, the ISM began to restrengthen during the phase-III (11 ka and >5 ka), with fluctuations. The phase-IV (<5 ka) is represented by a gradual decline in the ISM strength. The sediment isotopic analysis (Sr and Nd) reveals that the Indus River was the major contributor (similar to 48%), followed by the contribution from local reworking of Mesozoic lithology from Khadir Island (similar to 35%). The northern Thar Dune field contribution by ephemeral streams was around 14%, whereas the influence of Luni River at Trangadi Bet was insignificant (similar to 3%). The study observed that around 7 ka, hydrological conditions dwindled, which persisted during the IVC, dated to 5.5 ka-3.8 ka in the region. However, despite dwindling freshwater from the branch off northwest-southeast trending paleochannel (via Indus), it has been hypothesized that the IVC in the EGRK (at Dholavira on Khadir Island) was sustained by the ephemeral monsoon-fed channels.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				2025 SEP 30	2025										10.1177/09596836251366207	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836251366207		SEP 2025											WOS:001585946300001

The study area is located between latitudes 41N-49N and longitudes 87W-98W. The northern part of the study area is covered by snow for the whole winter season however for the southern part there is a pattern of snow-fall and snow melt within the season. In addition to snow pattern, the land cover type varies a wide range including, Evergreen Needle leaf forest, Deciduous Broadleaf forest, cropland, woodland and dry land. Seven SSM/I channels) formatted in EASE-Grid 25km by 25km have been used in this study. Two types of ground truth data were used: 1- Point-based snow depth observations from National Climate Data Center (NCDC) snow monitoring section; 2- Grid based SNODAS-SWE dataset, produced at 1km spatial resolution by National Operational Hydrological Remote Sensing Center (NOHRSC). To do the time series analysis, three scattering signatures of GTVN (19V-37V), GTH (19H-37H), and SSI (22V-85V) were derived. The analysis shows at lower latitudes of the study area there is no correlation between GTH and GTVN versus snow depth. On the other hand SSI shows an average correlation of 75 percent with snow depth in lower latitudes. This is due to the saturation of channel 85GHz which makes SSI only suitable for estimating shallow snow cover. As the first step in model development a multi-linear algorithm was defined to estimate SWE using microwave along with NDVI. This algorithm divides the study area into sub-areas based on their NDVI value and the geographical coordinates. For each of those sub-areas a separate linear algorithm is defined to estimate SWE using GTVN and SSI indexes. The results show up to 60 percent correlation between estimated and ground truth SWE. Also, contradictory to Chang and Goodison-Walker algorithms that highly underestimate the total SWE, multi-linear algorithm tends to follow the ground truth pattern of total SWE in the study area. Second, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model was developed. The ANN model with seven SSM/I channels and NDVI as its input showed better correlations compare to using only SSM/I as input. This indicates the potential of using ANNs to use combination of various data types.

Chemical composition of groundwater as well as water of lakes, the main watercourse, subglacial outflows and water representing direct meltwater recharge were studied to determine their origin, the depth of circulation and recharge systems. The results indicate that the main source of water in the glacial river were the subglacial outflows in the central part of the glacier. They generated 77% of the total amount of water in the glacier forefield. Direct inflow of groundwater from glacier moraine to proglacial river was marginally low and the water circulation system was shallow, fast and variable. There were no evidences for an important role of deeper than suprapermafrost water circulation systems. The water temperature, especially in the lakes, exceeding the mean daily air temperature during the ablation period, is due to the heating of the ground moraine rocks. A clear difference between groundwater chemical composition and surface water as well as subglacial runoff in terms of major ions, together with the homogeneity of chemical composition of the proglacial river from spring to mouth confirmed the marginal role of groundwater runoff in the drainage of the catchment area. It was confirmed that the chemical composition of groundwater and moraine lakes in the glacier forefield was shaped by geological factors, i.e., mainly chemical weathering of sulphides, carbonates and secondary sulphates. The possibility of secondary iron hydroxide precipitation and a high probability of complex aluminosilicate transformations were also demonstrated.

Sakari; Valiranta, Minna; Weckstrom, Jan			Development of an Eemian (MIS 5e) Interglacial palaeolake at Sokli (N Finland) inferred using multiple proxies	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												A 12 m long lacustrine record from Sokli, N Finland, was analyzed for diatoms, non-pollen palynomorphs, macrofossils, pollen and geochemistry in order to reconstruct the development of a high-latitude Eemian lake and investigate the influence of climatic and environmental changes on the lake ecosystem. Based on this multi-proxy dataset we distinguished five major lake phases in the lake's evolution. An initial minerogenic, glacio-lacustrine phase was followed by an organic-rich early Eemian lake phase characterized by anoxic bottom waters, high seasonality and rising nutrient levels. A long open water season, pronounced summer stratification and high productivity characterized the following early mid-Eemian lake phase, corresponding to the Eemian thermal maximum. During the late mid-Eemian lake phase decreasing water depths due to infilling and extensive mixing of the water column resulted in less stable summer stratification and decreased anoxia. The late-Eemian lake phase was characterized by shallow and dynamic conditions and a cooling climate. Superimposed on these general trends are two events characterized by colder and more arid conditions, that possibly match cold and arid events registered in palaeolimnological records on the European continent. In general, the multi-proxy record reflects a nutrient rich lake, where changes in mixing regime associated with climatic forcing and lake level changes asserted a major impact on the aquatic assemblages. The changes in the aquatic assemblages reflect the major patterns of climate change that took place during the Eemian in northern Europe; i.e. a rapid warming and high seasonality during the early Eemian, decreased seasonality during the mid Eemian and a cooling late Eemian with increased seasonality. The high latitude Sokli Eemian palaeolake record lengthens the latitudinal extent of Eemian terrestrial records across Europe, adding to the understanding of climatic gradients and drivers over Europe.

J	Robert, M; Laporte, P; Benoit, R				Robert, M; Laporte, P; Benoit, R			Summer habitat of Yellow Rails, Coturnicops noveboracensis, along the St. Lawrence River, Quebec	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												As part of our investigations of Quebec birds at risk. we studied Yellow Rail (Coturnicops noveboracensis) habitats at three localities (Ile aux Grues, Cacouna and Lake Saint-Francois National Wildlife Area) along the St. Lawrence River, in southern Quebec, from 1993 to 1995. Circles. 0.2-ha in area, centred on six nests discovered at lie aux Grues (the first nests reported east of Ontario in half a century), were characterized by herbaceous plants belonging to the Gramineae (Spartina pectinata), Cyperaceae (Carex paleacea and C. hormatodes) or Juncaceae (Juncus balticus). All nearing habitats (circles) had very high mean percent cover of live vegetation. All also had a well-developed senescent vegetation canopy from the previous year's growth. Habitats used at Cacouna and Lake Saint-Francois National Wildlife Area were dominated by the same plant families, although the species varied among localities (Carex paleacea, Scirpus maritimus, and Carex macken-ziei at Cacouna: Carex lacustris. Calamagrostis canadensis, and Carex aquatilis at Lake Saint-Francois National Wildlife Areal. Each habitat usually had shallow ( 12 cm) or no measurable standing water, but the substrate remained water-saturated throughout the summer. Although Carex sedges predominated in each habitat, we found that other graminoid plant species provided important cover. In our view, Carex sedges should not be considered the only indicator plant species of Yellow Rail habitat; we believe instead that the Yellow Rail. in common with other rail species, may tolerate considerable variation in certain, subtle features of its summer habitat. such as plant species composition, stem density, or height of vegetation, Habitat selection may be influenced primarily by plant physiognomy and maximum water levels. We also believe that the presence of a concealing senescent vegetation canopy constitutes a specific feature of Yellow Rail breeding habitat.																			0008-3550					OCT-DEC	2000	114	4					628	635																WOS:000168613900008

The lake has a history of water quality problems and has been an efficient trap for suspended sediment and sediment-associated contaminants. Based on bathymetric survey data, the loss of volume in Lake Pepin between 1897 and 1986 was estimated. The mass balance of the lake for total suspended solids, chlorophyll a, total and dissolved reactive phosphorus and total nitrogen for 9 June 1987 to 4 June 1988 was also estimated. Water was sampled at the inflow, mid-reach, and outflow of the lake. Lake Pepin is very eutrophic, based on concentrations of phosphorus, nitrogen and chlorophyll a. The lake volume decreased by approximately 21% between 1897 and 1986. Longitudinally, the greatest fraction of the whole-lake volume loss occurred in the upper lake (45%). Based on mass balance calculations, the lake trapped about half of the suspended solids entering the lake, but it had a small net export of chlorophyll a. The lake was a sink for phosphorus and nitrogen; however, it had a net export of total phosphorus at times during low flows in the summer of 1987. Internal loading of dissolved reactive phosphorus was prevalent during the summer of 1987. The only substantial export of total nitrogen occurred in June 1987 during a bloom of cyanobacteria. The lake should continue to be an efficient trap for suspended sediment and associated contaminants, but its trapping efficiency will continue to decline slowly as lake volume decreases. Lake Pepin will probably continue to experience water quality problems, such as nuisance algal growths and low dissolved oxygen, especially during summer low flows.																			0886-9375					OCT	1995	11	2					175	184		10.1002/rrr.3450110207	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rrr.3450110207													WOS:A1995TC92600006

J	MILDENHALL, DC				MILDENHALL, DC			SUMMARY OF THE AGE AND PALEOECOLOGY OF THE MIOCENE MANUHERIKIA GROUP, CENTRAL-OTAGO, NEW-ZEALAND	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF NEW ZEALAND												Pollen analyses of ten sections through the Miocene Manuherikia Group of Central Otago have confirmed the presence of a number of paleoenvironments previously determined by sedimentological studies. The depositional environments include peat swamps, levees, flood plains, braided channels, permanent and ephemeral lakes, inter- distributary bays, beaches and back swamps. Most localities contain a complex mixture of sedimentary types and a great diversity in the spore-pollen assemblages reflecting a dynamic, constantly changing, local environment caused by a combination of tectonic activity, changing climatic patterns, fire, soil parent material and sedimentary sources. The climate was warm temperate, probably never subtropical, moist and humid, although subject to periodic droughts. Fire played a significant role in some areas as indicated by the abundance of charcoal in some samples. The oldest sediments occur in the east of the study area around Gimmerburn. These sediments fall into the upper part of the Proteacidites isopogiformis Zone of early Miocene (Otaian-Altonian) age. All other sequences through the Manuherikia Group fall into the Tricolpites latispinosus Zone of early Miocene (Altonian and possibly slightly younger) age. Sediments of late Miocene (Taranaki Series) age at some localities are assigned to the Maori Bottom Group.																			0303-6758	1175-8899				MAR	1989	19	1					19	29																WOS:A1989T907200002

Age-0 Lost River sucker and shortnose sucker nearshore habitat use in Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon: A patch occupancy approach	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We examined habitat use by age-0 Lost River suckers Deltistes luxatus and shortnose suckers Chasmistes brevirostris over six substrate classes and in vegetated and nonvegetated areas of Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon. We used a patch occupancy approach to model the effect of physical habitat and water quality conditions on habitat use. Our models accounted for potential inconsistencies in detection probability among sites and sampling occasions as a result of differences in fishing gear types and techniques, habitat characteristics, and age-0 fish size and abundance. Detection probability was greatest during mid- to late summer, when water temperatures were highest and age-0 suckers were the largest. The proportion of sites used by age-0 suckers was inversely related to depth (range 0.4-3.0 m), particularly during late summer. Age-0 suckers were more likely to use habitats containing small substrate (<64 mm) than those containing large substrate (>64 mm) and habitats with vegetation than those without vegetation. Relatively narrow ranges in dissolved oxygen, temperature, and pH prevented us from detecting effects of these water quality features on age-0 sucker nearshore habitat use.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAR	2008	137	2					417	430		10.1577/T07-072.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T07-072.1													WOS:000255322100005
J	Meyer, N; Kunz, M; Link, RM; von Oheimb, G				Meyer, Nora; Kunz, Matthias; Link, Roman Mathias; von Oheimb, Goddert			Reed between the lines: Terrestrial 3D laser scanning to assess recreational impacts on lakeshore vegetation	LIMNOLOGICA												Swimming in lakes and spending time on the shore are popular summer activities, but as climate change continues and land use intensifies, pressure on lakeshore ecosystems is increasing. In particular, plants play an important role in these ecosystems by stabilizing the shoreline and providing habitat, but they suffer from trampling and destruction caused by human use. However, the effects of lakeshore recreation on plants are not well understood. To assess the impact of bathers on the reed bed and the area of the shoreline used for sunbathing, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) was employed to analyze changes in the aboveground spatial distribution of plant material at very high spatial or temporal resolution. Measurements were taken before and after summer weekends at nine lakes in Brandenburg, Germany, and the occupancy status of voxels (i.e., cubic volume elements) in voxelized TLS point clouds of the lakeshore vegetation was compared. In addition, standardized visitor counts were conducted to determine the bathing sites' visitation rates. Over the course of a summer weekend, bathing and control sites displayed similar changes in total reed volume. The analysis has identified no clear relationship between the highly dynamic volume changes and the bathing activity along the gradient of visitor density that has been considered here. The variation of vegetation in the sunbathing area was generally small and showed no clear tendency for directed loss or gain after a weekend. As we studied established sites, the vegetation may have already adapted to human use. While the current visitor density and visitor behavior do not appear to be causing discernible changes, visitor management measures will be necessary if the intensity of use increases in the future.

The results give a geographically differentiated picture of the Late Miocene climate in the circum-Alpine area. Spatial patterns are presented in maps for mean annual temperature, temperature of the coldest month, temperature of the warmest month, mean annual precipitation, and mean annual range of temperature. The obtained data show an overall warm, humid, and homogenous climate with very low latitudinal and longitudinal gradients; there is no indication of a Mediterranean type of climate. Palaeogeographic influences on climate patterns are evident; the Pannonian Lake caused mild winters and a lower seasonality of temperature in the Pannonian basin. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Spring temperature responses of oaks are synchronous with North Atlantic conditions during the last deglaciation	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Paleoclimate proxies based on the measurement of xylem cell anatomy have rarely been developed across the temperature range of a species or applied to wood predating the most recent millennium. Here we describe wood anatomy-based proxies for spring temperatures in central North America from modern bur oaks (Quercus macrocarpa Michx.). The strong coherence of temperature signals across the species range supports the use of these proxies across thousands of years of climatic change. We also used 79 subfossil oak log cross sections from northern Missouri, C-14-dated to 9.9-13.63 ka (ka is 1000 cal yr BP), to assess the frequency of oak deposition into alluvial sediments and a subset of these oaks for a wood anatomy-based reconstruction of spring paleotemperatures. Temperatures during the Younger Dryas cold period (YD) were up to 3.5 degrees C lower than modern temperatures for that region, equivalent to or lower than those experienced at the northern edge of the modern species range. Compared to extant oaks growing at much higher [CO2], subfossil oaks had greater vessel frequencies. Besides very low theoretical (or estimated) xylem conductivity near the beginning of the oak record near 13.6 ka, vessel frequencies greater than modern trees compensated for reduced vessel dimensions so that theoretical xylem conductivity was consistently above that of modern trees at the cold northern sites. Significant correlations were found between the frequency of C-14-dated oaks and either delta O-18 from the NGRIP (North Greenland Ice Core Project) ice core or from the Cariaco grayscale marine-sediment record from the southern Caribbean sea. Oak deposition into alluvial sediments during the YD was significantly lower than expected given the average sample depth of oaks from 9.9 to 13.6 ka. Reduced oak deposition during the YD suggests that an abrupt shift in climate reduced oak populations across the region and/or changed the rates of channel movement across drainages.

J	ERIKSSON, C; FORSBERG, C				ERIKSSON, C; FORSBERG, C			NUTRIENT INTERACTIONS AND PHYTOPLANKTON GROWTH DURING THE SPRING BLOOM PERIOD IN LAKE ERKEN, SWEDEN	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												Factorial enrichment experiments with nitrate-N, phosphate-P and selenite-Se, were conducted in situ, with natural phytoplankton assemblages, during two consecutive spring-bloom periods (1983 and 1984) in Lake Erken, Sweden. Nutrient conditions, biomass indicators and algal physiological status, in experiments and in lake water, were compared. Characteristic peaks of phytoplankton, dominated by diatoms, developed in the lake in both years. In 1984, chlorophyll alpha biomass (30 mug l-1) reached almost twice that of 1983 (17 mug l-1). Inorganic P resources were depleted in both years, but inorganic N was exhausted only in 1984. In 1983, Stephanodiscus hantzschii GRUN v. pusillus GRUN. KRIEGER completely dominated the biomass peak. In 1984, Melosira islandica v. helvetica O. MULL occurred in great numbers along with S. hantzschii v. pusillus. The growth rate of S. hantzschii v. pusillus, surplus phosphorus dynamics and potential alkaline phosphatase activity were different during the two spring periods. In the experiments, eight alternative nutrient situations were tested during four phases of the natural phytoplankton development. The algae responded to enrichments during the entire phytoplankton bloom in 1983 and 1984. Nutrient interactions were important, especially in 1983, and occurred most frequently during the late exponential phase, biomass maximum and declining phase in both years. Interactions between N and P were most common in 1983, occurring during the late exponential phase and biomass maximum. N and Se interaction occurred occasionally. Interactions between P and Se were more frequent in 1983 than in 1984. When nutrients interacted, the combined effect was generally smaller than the sum of their individual effects. P deficiency indicators and the experiments showed clearly that the bloom of 1983 was P limited. In 1984 no such clear pattern was found.																			0020-9309						1992	77	4					517	551		10.1002/iroh.19920770402	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19920770402													WOS:A1992KF31500001

IceCube Enhanced Hot Water Drill functional description	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY												The Ice Cube Neutrino Observatory was constructed at the South Pole during the 2004/05 to 2010/11 austral summer seasons. Ice Cube transforms 1 m(3) of Antarctic ice into an astrophysical particle detector composed of 86 cables (strings) of optical sensors buried deep beneath the surface. Each string required drilling a borehole similar to 60 cm in diameter to a depth of 2500 m. The 5 MW Enhanced Hot Water Drill was designed and built specifically for this task, capable of producing the required boreholes at a rate of one hole per 48 hours. Hot-water drilling on this scale presented unique challenges and was rich in lessons learned, yielding a collection of notable developments and takeaways (e.g. fuel-saving measures, thermal modeling, firn drilling and closed-loop computer control). Descriptions of system functionality and of lessons learned from Ice Cube drilling are presented.					; Mulligan, Mark/V-9275-2019	DuVernois, Michael/0000-0002-2987-9691; 													0260-3055	1727-5644					2014	55	68					105	114		10.3189/2014AoG68A032	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/2014AoG68A032													WOS:000351889600015

Habitat selection is a hierarchical process, in which selection at higher orders (geographic range, home range) may constrain selection at lower orders (within the home range). Habitat selection at a very fine scale within the home range has been less studied for both lynx and bobcat compared to selection at broader spatiotemporal scales. To compare this fourth-order habitat selection by the two species in an area of sympatry, we tracked lynx and bobcat during the winters of 2017 and 2018 on the north shore of Lake Huron, Ontario. We found that both lynx and bobcat selected shallower snow, higher snowshoe hare abundance, and higher amounts of coniferous forest at the fourth order. However, the two species were spatially segregated at the second order, and lynx were found in areas with deeper snow, more snowshoe hare, and more coniferous forest. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the lynx and bobcat select different resources at the second order, assorting along an environmental gradient in the study area, and that competition is unlikely to be occurring between the two species at finer scales.					; Bowman, Jeff/B-4147-2009	Marrotte, Robby R./0000-0003-4383-4673; Morin, Samantha J./0000-0003-2755-4209; 													2045-7758					SEP	2020	10	17					9396	9409		10.1002/ece3.6626	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.6626		AUG 2020						32953069					WOS:000560221100001

We documented the presence or absence of subyearlings at 277 sample sites and collected physical habitat information at each site. Based on logistic regression, we found that the probability of fish presence was greater in unaltered shoreline habitats than in riprap habitats. Substrate size was the most important factor in determining fish presence, with dominant substrates larger than 256 mm having the lowest probability of fish presence. Water velocity, also included in our model due to its biological importance, was not a significant factor affecting presence or absence (P = 0.1102). The correct prediction rate of fish presence or absence in our sample sites using cross validation was 67%. Our model showed that substrate was the most important factor determining subyearling habitat use, but the model did not include other habitat variables known to be important to subyearlings in more diverse systems. We suggest that resource managers consider alternative methods of bank stabilization that are compatible with the habitat requirements of the fish that use them.

The measurements were carried out once a month, at points representing three different basins in the lake, and the temperatures and oxygen content dissolved in the water were recorded every 1m from the surface to the bottom at the deepest point of each basin. The changes in temperatures and content of dissolved oxygen were analysed in each of the representative measurement points for particular parts of the lake. It has been shown that the deficit of oxygen dissolved in the bottom layers of the water starts occurring by the beginning of the summer stagnation period, whereas at its peak (August) the anaerobic zone includes hypolimnion and part of the metalimnion. The hypothesis that the thickness of the thermal layers varies within the lake basin was confirmed. It was also shown that the oxygen content curve at representative points, in all years of research, evolves to the form of a clinograde at the peak of summer stagnation, where the concentration of dissolved oxygen decreases with the depth.																			1734-7009	2084-0535				MAR	2018	62	1					85	96		10.2478/phr-2018-0007	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/phr-2018-0007													WOS:000438813300007

Subaerial and sublacustrine hydrothermal activity at Lake Rotomahana	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Lake Rotomahana is a crater lake in the Okataina Volcanic Centre (New Zealand) that was significantly modified by the 1886 Tarawera Rift eruption. The lake is host to numerous sublacustrine hydrothermal vents. Water column studies were conducted in 2011 and 2014 along with sampling of lake shore hot springs and crater lakes in Waimangu Valley to complement magnetic, seismic, bathymetric and heat flux surveys. Helium concentrations below 50 m depth are higher in 2014 compared to 2011 and represent some of the highest concentrations measured, at 6 x 10(-7) ccSTP/g, with an end-member He-3/He-4 value of 7.1 R-A. The high concentrations of helium, when coupled with pH anomalies due to high dissolved CO2 content, suggest the dominant chemical input to the lake is derived from magmatic degassing of an underlying magma. The lake shore hot spring waters show differences in source temperatures using a Na-K geothermometer, with inferred reservoir temperatures ranging between 197 and 232 degrees C. Water delta O-18 and delta D values show isotopic enrichment due to evaporation of a steam heated pool with samples from nearby Waimangu Valley having the greatest enrichment. Results from this study confirm both pre-1886 eruption hydrothermal sites and newly created post-eruption sites are both still active. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Exceptional visual clarity and optical purity in a sub-alpine lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Blue Lake, a remote sub-alpine lake, in Nelson Lakes National Park, New Zealand, has exceptional optical purity. Horizontal sighting range ('visibility') on six visits approached 80 m, the theoretical limit based on accepted light-attenuation coefficients for pure water, making Blue Lake the most visually clear freshwater yet reported. Blue Lake is characterized by blue-violet hues seen only in the clearest natural waters. Light penetration is as expected for pure water, except in the ultraviolet to blue spectrum where light-attenuation is increased slightly by very low ('oceanic') concentrations of colored dissolved organic matter. Particulate concentrations are extremely low, comparable to those in the Southeast Pacific Gyre, and the lake is hyper (ultra) oligotrophic (Chlorophyll a concentrations similar to 0.014 mg m(-3)). Continuous monitoring of beam attenuation (532 nm) over 18 months demonstrated consistently high visual clarity, except for short-lived episodes following turbid inflows from ephemeral streams. The dominant inflow to Blue Lake comes from springs emerging from the face of landslide debris separating the lake from nearby glacial Lake Constance. The optical purity of Blue Lake apparently reflects efficient removal of particles and dissolved organic matter during groundwater flow from Lake Constance to these springs. Blue Lake may be valuable in aquatic optics research for testing optical instruments and models.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2013	58	2					443	451		10.4319/lo.2013.58.2.0443	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2013.58.2.0443													WOS:000317954300002

In an attempt to highlight the benefits of finer resolutions to study the RCM added value, five North American weather phenomena are evaluated in RCM hindcast simulations using grid meshes of 0.44A degrees, 0.22A degrees and 0.11A degrees with available observations. The results show that the orographic precipitation on the west coast of North America is enhanced and more realistic, with two distinct rain bands in the finer resolution simulation. The spatial distribution of precipitation in August and the high frequency of summer precipitation extremes over southwestern United States reveal that the North American monsoon is improved with increasing resolution. Only the finer RCM simulation shows skill at producing snowbelts around the Great Lakes by capturing lake-effect snow. A comparison of wind roses in the St. Lawrence River Valley indicates that only the finer RCM simulation is able to reproduce wind channeling by resolving complex orography. Finally, the simulation of the summer land-sea breezes by the RCM simulations leads to added value in the diurnal cycle of precipitation over the Florida peninsula and the Caribbean islands. Overall, the almost systematic improvements of the finer resolution simulations suggest that higher resolutions, only computationally affordable over smaller domains, might get a higher priority to promote RCM added value.

The spatial distribution of absolute minimum temperatures in the Abisko valley, and across the Finnmarksvidda and the coastal lowland to the north was deduced for the winters preceding the outbreaks. (3) In a complementary study, the supercooling points of the hibernating eggs of E. autumnata were determined. These data, together with the profiles of minimum termperatures, were used to define the distribution of egg-killing cold air accumulations in the Abisko valley and on the Finnmarksvidda. The patterns of cold air accumulations explained the horizontal and vertical extent of the undamaged forests, caused by the combined effects of defoliation and delimiting topoclimate.																			0021-8901	1365-2664				AUG	1990	27	2					723	734		10.2307/2404314	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2404314													WOS:A1990DR60500028
J	Ryan, CN; Thomas, MK; Litchman, E				Ryan, Caitlin N.; Thomas, Mridul K.; Litchman, Elena			The effects of phosphorus and temperature on the competitive success of an invasive cyanobacterium	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Rising lake temperatures and changing nutrient inputs are believed to favour the spread of a toxic invasive cyanobacterium, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Woloszynska) Seenayya and Subba Raju, in temperate lakes. However, most evidence for these hypotheses is observational or based on physiological measurements in monocultures. We lack clear experimental evidence relating temperature and nutrients to the competitive success of C. raciborskii. To address this, we performed a 2 x 2 factorial laboratory experiment to study the dynamics of mixed phytoplankton communities subjected to different levels of temperature and phosphorus over 51 days. We allowed C. raciborskii to compete with ten different species from major taxonomic groups (diatoms, green algae, cryptophytes, and cyanobacteria) typical of temperate lakes, under low and high summer temperatures (25 and 30 A degrees C) at two levels of phosphorus supply (1 and 25 A mu mol L-1). Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii dominated the communities and strongly decreased diversity under low-phosphorus conditions, consistent with the hypothesis that it is a good phosphorus competitor. In contrast, it remained extremely rare in high-phosphorus conditions, where fast-growing green algae dominated. Surprisingly, temperature played a negligible role in influencing community composition, suggesting that changes in summer temperature may not be important in determining C. raciborskii's spread.					; Thomas, Mridul/HZL-6270-2023	Thomas, Mridul/0000-0002-5089-5610; Litchman, Elena/0000-0001-7736-6332													1386-2588	1573-5125				SEP	2017	51	3					463	472		10.1007/s10452-017-9629-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-017-9629-0													WOS:000408340600010

Fitness heterogeneity in adult Snow and Ross's geese: Survival is higher in females with brood patches	AUK												Life-history theory broadly predicts a fitness tradeoff between costs of raising offspring and parental survival. Waterfowl with precocial young face particularly high costs of egg production, incubation, and brood-rearing, but not all evidence supports a corresponding decline in survival. We used multi-state mark-recapture-recovery models to estimate annual probabilities of survival, reported mortality, and transition between 2 states for female Ross's Geese (Anser rossii) and Lesser Snow Geese (A. caerulescens caerulescens) that attempted nesting near Karrak Lake, Nunavut, Canada. States were possession of a brood patch (high likelihood of successful nesting,"B") vs. no brood patch (attempted nesting but failed, "N"). Based on over 43,000 birds marked from 2000 to 2015, we found that females of each species with a brood patch had consistently higher probabilities of survival than those without, subsequent to capture in early August. Virtually all of the state differences in survival were due to nonhunting mortality. These patterns are consistent with the concept of variable individual quality impacting vital rates across multiple seasons. Higher survival of females with brood patches may be linked to greater breeding success but also to a hypothesized dominance advantage afforded to family groups of geese during winter. Moreover, although hunting pressure can play a key role in regulating Arctic goose populations, it does not appear to affect this relationship between inferred breeding state and survival. Instead, coincident with recent declines in harvest rate in these populations, higher individual quality of breeding females appears to outweigh the higher hunting vulnerability of presumed parents with young. The potential influence of social dominance in reducing natural winter mortality among families may thus contribute to the survival advantage seen in successful, relative to failed, breeders.																			0004-8038	1938-4254				JUL	2019	136	3							ukz027	10.1093/auk/ukz027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/auk/ukz027													WOS:000493040800006

Summer microhabitat use and overlap by the invasive Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) and native darters in the Trent River (Ontario, Canada)	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												Understanding the impacts of the invasive Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) is important for North American native fish conservation. One proposed mechanism for native species declines is competition for habitat. In this study, summer habitat use by Round Goby and Channel Darter (Percina copelandi) and Logperch (P. caprodes) was studied in the Trent River (Canada). Spot-electrofishing and systematic habitat sampling were used to measure habitat availability and use. Suitability for all species varied across the range of habitat conditions. At Glen Ross, habitat suitability for Channel Darter and Round Goby was highest at intermediate water depths (0.2-0.6 m), lowest at high water velocities (> 1.0 ms (-1)) and increased with greater amounts of gravel and cobble. There were no significance habitat differences between capture locations of the two species. At Meyer's Reach, Logperch and Round Goby habitat suitability was highest at intermediate water depths (0.4-0.6 m) and where gravel and cobble were abundant. The relationship between suitability and water velocity differed between species, with moderate velocities less suitable for Round Goby. The amount of boulder and bedrock at capture locations of each species differed. Results indicate that competition for habitat with Round Goby will vary among darter species.

Andrew G.; Smith, Alan M.; Rishworth, Gavin M.; Forbes, Matt			Reviews and syntheses: Tufa microbialites on rocky coasts - towards an integrated terminology	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Microbialites are known from a range of terrestrial, freshwater, marine, and marginal settings. The descriptive terminology used in each instance depends largely on the historical legacy derived from previous studies in similar environments. This has led to a diversity of nomenclature and a lack of conformity in the terms used to describe and categorise microbialites. As the role of microbial mats and biofilms is increasingly recognised in the formation of tufa and terrestrial carbonates, deposits such as tufa microbialites bridge the spectrum of microbialites and terrestrial carbonate deposits. Groundwater spring-fed tufa microbialites in supratidal rock coast environments that occur at the interface of terrestrial and marine domains demonstrate the need for an integrative and systematic nomenclature approach. To date, their global distribution and complex relationships with pre-defined deposits have resulted in the application of a variety of descriptive terminologies, most frequently at the macro- and mesoscale. Here we review and consolidate the multi-scale library of terminologies for microbialites and present a new geomorphological scheme for their description and classification. This scheme has greater alignment with terrestrial carbonate nomenclature at the macroscale and with marine and lacustrine microbialites at the mesoscale. The proposed terminology can primarily be applied to tufa microbialites in spring-fed supratidal environments but may also be applicable in other relevant depositional environments including terrestrial carbonates, microbial mats, and other microbialites.					; Cooper, Andrew/AAH-4251-2020; smith, Alan/NGS-4737-2025	Cooper, Andrew/0000-0003-4972-8812; 													1726-4170	1726-4189				NOV 5	2024	21	21					4785	4807		10.5194/bg-21-4785-2024	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-4785-2024													WOS:001347585500001

A total of 213 saw-whet owls were trapped, with as many as 73 individuals netted in 52 nights of a single autumn. The peak of the migration occurred on 23 Oct.; two-thirds of the individuals were taken within a 2 week period centered on this date. The numbers of individuals taken per unit net area per night and the age ratio of individuals taken varied considerably from year to year. Adults are slightly, but significantly, larger than immatures. Weight records of recaptured birds indicate that weight fluctuates but little, and that some individuals feed during daylight hours.																			0006-3630						1967	38	2					120	+		10.2307/4511358	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4511358													WOS:A19679282300003

Up to 61% of the 16S rDNA sequences found were closely related to sequences retrieved from lakes, glaciers or polar systems. The distribution of these sequences was not homogeneous, with vertical differences found in both bacterial taxa composition and isolation source of the closest match from GenBank. In the surface sample 86% of the sequences were related to bacteria found in soils, seawater or gut microbiota, probably explained by waterborne transport from the catchment, by wind through sea sprays, or local bird activity. Conversely, in the deep samples, 95% of the sequences were closer to bacteria typically described for lakes, glaciers or polar systems. The presence of benthic mosses covering the bottom of the lake favours a more stable deep layer leading to the existence of this biological heterogeneity through the water column, although the lake does not show physical-chemical stratification in summer. This study illustrates a strong influence of external factors on the microbial ecology of this model Antarctic lake.

To improve coverage for subsequent drainage events, we extended the elevation and icevelocity time series on Thwaites Glacier through austral winter 2019. These new observations document a second drainage cycle in 2017/18 and identified two new lake systems located in the western tributaries of Thwaites and Haynes glaciers. In situ and satellite velocity observations show temporary < 3% speed fluctuations associated with lake drainages. In agreement with previous studies, these observations suggest that active subglacial hydrology has little influence on thinning and retreat of Thwaites Glacier on decadal to centennial timescales.					; Joughin, Ian/AAR-7778-2021	Hoffman, Andrew/0000-0003-1236-5704; Shapero, Daniel/0000-0002-3651-0649													1994-0416	1994-0424				DEC 18	2020	14	12					4603	4609		10.5194/tc-14-4603-2020	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-4603-2020													WOS:000600429800001

Increasing (decreasing) trends of isotope values (delta D and delta O-18) occur from May to June (September to October), and the valleys occur from July to August. The correlation between delta D and delta O-18 for both precipitation events and monthly average precipitation is significant, with high R-2 values (>= 0.98). The differences in regression lines may be due to the comprehensive influence of moisture sources, transport path and sub-cloud processes. Combining the d-excess values of precipitation and air mass trajectories generated by the HYSPLIT model, precipitation with a low (high) d-excess value and a more (less) negative delta O-18 corresponds to moisture from ocean (inland) sources. The delta O-18-temperature (T) and delta O-18-precipitation (P) correlations are not significant and vary greatly among different periods, which may be attributed to the mutual masking of different effects and the influence of atmospheric circulation processes. The results imply that the negative values in biological and geological proxies may be related to warmer climate, higher precipitation and a larger contribution of oceanic monsoon precipitation, but cannot indicate the changes in temperature and precipitation quantifiably.

However, the mechanisms responsible for the spatiotemporal pattern of EASM precipitation remain unclear. We present a new Holocene loess-paleosol record from the Hexi Corridor on the EASM margin. Environmental magnetic parameters (chi lf, chi fd, chi ARM/SIRM, and chi fd/HIRM) indicate that precipitation was low during 14-8 ka and then increased to a maximum during 4-2 ka. Integrated with published records, our results reveal a distinct geographical gradient in the timing of the Holocene precipitation maximum: an early Holocene peak in eastern Inner Mongolia, a mid-Holocene peak in the central and eastern Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP), and a late Holocene peak in the western CLP and central Hexi Corridor. In addition to these zonal differences, we also observed a longitudinal difference in the timing of the Holocene precipitation peak, which occurred later in the southern region than in the northern region. Combined with existing paleoclimate and climate simulation results we propose that this spatial difference in the timing of the Holocene precipitation peak reflects the movement of the EASM rainfall belt related to the westward extension and northward shift of the western Pacific subtropical high. Overall, our findings provide evidence for the location of the westernmost boundary of EASM influence and offer a unified explanation for regional differences in EASM precipitation and its timing.

This was the first observation of invasive WDS in wild adult walleyes. A transmission trial was attempted to determine whether the virus associated with these invasive lesions would support the development of invasive WDS in an experimental transmission model. Transmission using inocula prepared from the invasive lesions was very poor compared with that resulting from our typical pooled-tumor inoculum. In addition, no in vasive WDS developed. We believe that these results are due, in part, to a relatively low amount of virus in the invasive tumors, which appeared to be in a necrotic state.

The results were examined to assess the modification of snowmelt water after contact with the forest soil. Concentrations of NO3- increased from 17 to 201-mu-mol(c) L-1 and SO4(2-) increased from 25 to 107-mu-mol(c) L-1 as meltwater passed through the organic layers and the upper mineral-soil horizons. Mineralization of organic N and S, and desorption of SO4(2-) from the soil, provide sources of these ions for leaching during the snowmelt period. Ion-exchange reactions in the forest floor and upper mineral soil resulted in a decrease in H+ and an increase in Ca2+ concentration in solution. In the steep topography of this forested basin, the altered snowmelt solutions are rapidly transported downslope towards the aquatic system by lateral flow. Processes within the forest soil may therefore play an important role in determining the effects of snowmelt water on surface water chemistry in the spring.																			0047-2425					JAN-MAR	1992	21	1					102	109		10.2134/jeq1992.00472425002100010015x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1992.00472425002100010015x													WOS:A1992HD30400015
J	Chen, CC; Petersen, JE; Kemp, WM				Chen, CC; Petersen, JE; Kemp, WM			Nutrient-uptake in experimental estuarine ecosystems: scaling and partitioning rates	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Studies of nutrient cycling and enrichment in aquatic ecosystems are commonly conducted in enclosed experimental ecosystems. Although there is considerable information about how the dimensions of natural aquatic ecosystems influence nutrient cycling processes, little is known on how nutrient cycling studies might be affected by the physical scales of experimental enclosures. In the present study, replicate (n = 3) cylindrical containers of 5 dimensions with 3 volumes (0.1, 1.0, 10 m(3)), 3 depths (0.46, 1.0, 2.15 m), and 5 diameters (0.35, 0.52, 1.13, 2.44, 3.57 m) were established and subjected to pulsed additions of dissolved inorganic nutrients (DIN, PO43-, Si) in summer and autumn experiments. Consistent with common experimental protocols, walls of these containers were not cleaned of periphytic growth during the 8 wk studies. Nutrient concentrations in experimental ecosystems were low prior to nutrient-pulse additions and exhibited exponential depletion following treatments. Overall, larger containers had lower net uptake rates and higher nutrient concentrations than did smaller tanks. Relative contributions of planktonic, benthic and wall periphytic communities to total nutrient uptake varied in relation to dimensions of experimental systems. In general, net uptake rates by planktonic communities were inversely related to water depth, with higher rates associated with increased mean light-energy in shallower systems. Indirect estimates of benthic uptake rates, which were relatively low in all but the shallowest systems, tended also to be inversely related to depth and directly proportional to light levels at the sediment surface. In contrast, nutrient uptake by wall communities (per water volume) was inversely related to the radius of experimental containers. Differences in the 2 container dimensions, depth and radius, accounted for more than 90% of the variance in both net nutrient uptake by the whole ecosystem and the molar ratio of DIN/PO43- concentrations in the water column. Similarly, differences in net nutrient uptake rates among experimental ecosystems of different dimensions could be explained by the relative partitioning of rates among planktonic, periphytic, and benthic habitats. These results demonstrated that the physical dimensions of experimental ecosystems can have profound effects on measured nutrient dynamics. We also suggest that many of these experimental observations may be relevant also to more general scaling relations for nutrient cycling in natural aquatic ecosystems.					; kemp, Michael/F-9955-2013; Petersen, John/H-3820-2013	Chen, Chung-Chi/0000-0002-8357-9235; 													0171-8630	1616-1599					2000	200						103	116		10.3354/meps200103	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps200103													WOS:000088651400009
J	Moreno-Gonzalez, R				Moreno-Gonzalez, Ricardo			Vegetation responses to past volcanic disturbances at the Araucaria araucana forest-steppe ecotone in northern Patagonia	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Volcanic eruptions play an important role in vegetation dynamics and its historical range of variability. However, large events are infrequent and eruptions with a significant imprint in today's vegetation occurred far in the past, limiting our understanding of ecological processes. Volcanoes in southern Andes have been active during the last 10 ka and support unique ecosystems such as the Araucaria-Nothofagus forest. Araucaria is an endangered species, with a fragmented distribution and well-adapted to fire and volcanic disturbances. Yet, it was suggested that volcanism might have increased the fragmentation. Through the use of pollen and tephra analysis from a sedimentary record, this paleoecological study aims to provide an insight into the vegetation responses to past volcanic disturbances, to assess the role of volcanic disturbance on the vegetation dynamics and to determine if the current fragmentation has been caused by volcanism. Results show that during the last 9 kyr, 39 tephra falls buried the vegetation around Lake Relem, more frequently between 4 and 2 ka. The pollen percentage indicates that the vegetation changed after small tephra fall but seldom caused significant changes. However, the large eruption of Sollipulli volcano (similar to 3 ka) changed the environmental conditions affecting severely the vegetation. Ephedra dominated the early successional stage, perhaps facilitating Nothofagus recovering after similar to 500 years. Slight increase of Araucaria and Nothofagus obliqua-type pollen percentages suggests that forest resisted without permanent changes and recovered relatively fast after the large eruption, perhaps because of sparse biological legacies distributed in the landscape. In the study area, the relative stability of Araucaria pollen after several tephra fall suggests no change in its past distribution at the current forest-steppe ecotone, thus not affecting its current conservation status. Perhaps, random factors, the colonization patterns of the high elevations in the Andes after deglaciation and topography might play a more important role than previously thought.

Tropical Andean climate variations since the last deglaciation	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Global warming during the Last Glacial Termination was interrupted by millennial- scale cool intervals such as the Younger Dryas and the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR). Although these events are well characterized at high latitudes, their impacts at low latitudes are less well known. We present high- resolution temperature and hydroclimate records from the tropical Andes spanning the past similar to 16,800 y using organic geochemical proxies applied to a sediment core from Laguna Llaviucu, Ecuador. Our hydroclimate record aligns with records from the western Amazon and eastern and central Andes and indicates a dominant long- term influence of changing austral summer insolation on the intensity of the South American Summer Monsoon. Our temperature record indicates a similar to 4 degrees C warming during the glacial termination, stable temperatures in the early to mid- Holocene, and slight, gradual warming since similar to 6,000 y ago. Importantly, we observe a similar to 1.5 degrees C cold reversal coincident with the ACR. These data document a temperature change pattern during the deglaciation in the tropical Andes that resembles temperatures at high southern latitudes, which are thought to be controlled by radiative forcing from atmospheric greenhouse gases and changes in ocean heat transport by the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation.

With the growth of proxy records for decades, however, both its nature and its spatial pattern have become controversial. Here we examined multi-proxy data of the grain-size distribution, ostracode assemblage, pollen assemblage, and the pollen-reconstructed mean annual precipitation from a sediment core at Hulun Lake in northeastern Inner Mongolia spanning the period between 5000 and 3000 cal. yr BP to identify the nature and the associated mechanism of the 4.2 ka BP event occurring in the monsoonal region of eastern Asia. Higher sand fraction contents, littoral ostracode abundances, and Chenopodiaceae pollen percentages together with lower mean annual precipitation reveal a significant dry event at the interval of 4210-3840 cal. yr BP that could be a regional manifestation of the 4.2 ka BP event in the northern margin of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). We suggest that the drought would be caused by a decline in the intensity of the EASM on millennial-to-centennial scales that could be physically related to persistent cooling of surface waters in the western tropical Pacific and the North Atlantic. The cooling of western tropical Pacific surface waters could reduce moisture production over the source area of the EASM, while the cooling of North Atlantic surface waters could suppress northward migrations of the EASM rain belt, both leading to a weakened EASM and thus decreased rainfall in the northern margin of the EASM.

The deposits show that the main alluvial changes described in Northern Europe occurred simultaneously at "La Brunetiere". Two major phases of channel incision in the basal Pleniglacial gravel body have been identified. The first channels developed at the very onset of the Bolling, i.e. before 12,700 +/- 45 BP in a steppic landscape. Rapid channel abandonment allowed development of a small lake, filled in with alternating peat and clay layers rich in vegetal debris. Pollen data as well as molluscs and insects point to an open Artemisia steppe with juniper trees, together with a local component of riparian shrubs (willow and dwarf birch). Palaeotemperatures reconstructed from coleopteran assemblages indicate larger-than-today yearly thermal amplitude with cold winters and warm summers. The lacustrine clays and peats are buried by sandy overbank deposits that are attributed to the Older and/or the Upper Dryas. Channel drying and subsequent hydromorphic soil development relate respectively to the Allerod or the early Holocene. The second phase of incision corresponds to the Preboreal and is typified by stable anastomosed channel formation. Most of these were abandoned during the Boreal and filled by organic clay. An Upper Magdalenian lithic industry has been discovered in a paleosol on the bank of the Late-glacial channel. It includes ca. 200 flakes and 800 small debris of local Maestrichtian flint, and only 15 full-debitage blades and 6 tools.

Returns of chinook salmon improved annually until the late-1980s, when, with little warning, spring epizootics reduced the abundance of adult salmon by 50% or more. Reduced abundance of alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus), coupled with an increase in chinook salmon density and heavy parasite infection rates were hypothesized to have reduced chinook salmon growth and fitness and to have increased their susceptibility to BKD. Evidence of slower growth exists and low food availability may be the stressor that triggered the epizootics. Chinook salmon were a major component of the economic development, and subsequent hardship of the sportfishing industry on Lake Michigan. Sustaining the chinook salmon fishery at previous levels may require managing for high abundance of alewives, which may be inconsistent with overall fish community management goals, The future sustainability and role of chinook salmon needs to be reevaluated in the context of the entire Lake Michigan fish community.																			0899-7659					JUN	1998	10	2					202	210		10.1577/1548-8667(1998)010<0202:CSEILM>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8667(1998)010<0202:CSEILM>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000074170300014

COMPARISON WITH OTHER HIGH-ELEVATION LAKES	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												In ice-free seasons, phytoplankton production in subalpine Eastern Brook Lake, Sierra Nevada, California, ranged from 11.9 to 61.4-mu-g C L-1 d-1. Integrated production ranged from 40 to 235 mg C m-2 d-1 and yearly values would be 23.8 gC m-2 yr-1 (1986) and 22.4 gC m-2 yr-1 (1987). These values were in the middle ranges of those for other north-temperate, high-elevation lakes. Photosynthetic efficiencies were 0.016 to 0.103% and were similar to those in other subalpine lakes. Near-surface chlorophyll (ice-free season) ranged from 1.46 to 2.62-mu-g L-1 but approached 25-mu-g L-1 under the ice (winter 1987). Ice-free season chlorophyll values in Eastern Brook Lake were similar to those for other Sierra Nevada lakes except Lake Tahoe (lower values), but were generally higher than estimated values for other lakes. Dominant genera (ice-free season) were Chlorella or Disphora. Other genera were dominant in other lakes. Under the ice (1987) a massive bloom of the Chrysophyte Dinobryon occurred; a similar winter bloom was reported for a Colorado lake. Bacterial production ranged from 3 to 19-mu-g C L-1 d-1 and was similar to that in Austrian alpine lakes, but greater than that for a Norwegian mountain lake. Bacterial numbers ranged from 0.1 to 5.5 x 10(9) cells L-1 and were similar to those in other mountain lakes. In contrast with other mountain lakes, nutrients were rarely detectable in Eastern Brook Lake and the biota must depend on regeneration. We conclude that Eastern Brook Lake is oligotrophic, not ultraoligotrophic.

We assess the Holocene slip history through new mapping for the entire fault and a paleoseismic trenching investigation for the northern section of the fault. The fault is expressed in Holocene deposits for a minimum of 80 km and upward of 96 km, encompassing a wide deformation zone (similar to 0.5-2 km) characterized by short discontinuous fault scarps in young alluvial deposits, stepping and anastomosing fault strands, pop-up features, linear drainages, and sag ponds. Trenching on the northern section of the fault reveals evidence for at least two and possibly three surface-rupturing events since 15.8 +/- 1.3 ka, matching the timing of the Seehoo highstand of Lake Lahontan. Earthquakes are broadly constrained between 16.4 and 9.2 ka, a possible event between 9.0 and 6.4 ka, and an event between 3.5 and 0.1 ka, determined based on stratigraphic relationships and radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence geochronology. The ages of all three earthquakes provide a recurrence interval of similar to 5.5 +/- 1.6 ka for the fault. The earthquake timing overlaps with trenching results from the southern section of the fault, suggesting that full-length fault ruptures generating M-w 7.3-7.4 earthquakes are possible. Post-Lake Lahontan sand dunes are faulted in the Honey Lake basin along with pluvial lake deposits next to Honey Lake, providing supportive evidence for one or multiple Holocene earthquakes. Faults range in orientation from 270 degrees to 360 degrees and match the orientations of shears in clay model experiments suggesting that fault ruptures on the Warm Springs Valley fault are complex, similar to complex historical earthquakes, and consistent with youthful fault development in the northern Walker Lane.

The characteristics of DOM in tributaries of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) during the severe spring algal bloom period and their relationship with algal growth are unclear. In this study, the content, composition, and source of DOM in the Pengxi River (PXR) and Ruxi River (RXR) exhibiting typical TGR bloom problems were analyzed using various phys-icochemical indexes, carbon isotopes, fatty acids, and metagenomics. The results showed that chlorophyll a content increased with rising DOM concentration in the PXR and RXR. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) contents in the two rivers were 4.656-16.560 mg/L and 14.373-50.848 mu g/L, re-spectively, and increased during the bloom period. Four fluorescent components were identified, namely, two humic-like substances, and two protein-like substances. Proteobacteria, bacteroidetes, and actinobacteria were the greatest contributors to DOM content. The carbon fixation pathway of microorganisms increased the DOC concentra-tion in both rivers during the bloom period. Physicochemical parameters (WT, pH, DO, and PAR) affected the DOM concentration by influencing microbial activity and DOM degradation. DOM in both rivers was derived from alloch-thonous and autogenous sources. Meanwhile, the DOC content was more strongly correlated with allochthonous sources. These findings might provide essential information for improving water environment management and algal bloom control in the TGR.

Five viable populations of Rothschild's giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi) remain in protected areas in Kenya and Uganda. The viable population in Uganda is Murchison Falls National Park and the four populations in Kenya are Lake Nakuru National Park (LNNP), Ruma National Park, Giraffe Manor, and Mwea Natural Reserve. The Kenya Wildlife Service queried a rapid decline in LNNP giraffe numbers falling from 153 individuals (1995) to 62 individuals (2002) and the failure of that population to recruit young in those years. Significantly reduced browse options, inbreeding depression and preferential lion predation were considered as potential reasons for this trend. Population genetic parameter estimates derived from multilocus genotype analyses suggest that the LNNP population was in good genetic health with respect to the likelihood of inbreeding depression. The population decline coincided with the drought attributed to the 1994 El Nino. Possible dietary complications from highly concentrated tannin levels because of forced over consumption of the park's declining acacia trees may have compromised young giraffe, making them easy and opportunistic prey for the park's lion population.																			0141-6707	1365-2028				DEC	2009	47	4					711	719		10.1111/j.1365-2028.2008.01029.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2028.2008.01029.x													WOS:000271758600032

Although did not vary spatially, it did show significant temporal variation, with a particularly high value after spring-bloom. This high in spring was attributed to a lower package effect and a higher proportion of carotenoid than the other samples. Although the value of was correlated with the concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), the correlation coefficient was lower than those reported in the ocean. Some lake-water samples showed variations of the package effect and the effect of accessory pigments that were independent of the concentration of Chl-a, and these independent variations resulted in the weak correlation between and the concentration of Chl-a. Together, these results suggest that the factors controlling in highly eutrophic lakes are distinct from that in ocean samples.

We interpret periods of relatively low growing season (summer) moisture and increased fire activity between 1500-1300 and 1000-725 cal yr BP, the latter period is also characterised by remarkably rapid bulk sediment accumulation and we infer prolonged annual sedimentation resulting from a decrease in the duration of lake freezing under a warmer climate. Relatively moist conditions during summer and low fire activity occurred between 1300-1000 and 725-121 cal yr BR with slow bulk sediment accumulation through the latter phase in particular implying a cool and wet climate. Our results suggest that the Medieval Climate Anomaly chronozone was relatively warm and dry, followed by a cool-wet climate during the Little Ice Age chronozone, before a substantial modification of the vegetation landscape by Europeans occurred in the mid 1800's. The timing and direction of changes in the Laguna San Pedro record bear a striking resemblance to multiple independent tropical Pacific precipitation reconstructions, areas where precipitation is governed by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and with the modern influence of ENSO over the climate in the region. We conclude that ENSO was the main driver of changes in growing season moisture in this part of the Temperate-Mediterranean Transition in south-central Chile over the last 1500 years.

J	CONLEY, DJ; SCAVIA, D				CONLEY, DJ; SCAVIA, D			SIZE STRUCTURE OF PARTICULATE BIOGENIC SILICA IN LAKE-MICHIGAN	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Recent data suggest that chemical estimates of biogenic silica in the Laurentian Great Lakes include large fractions of non-living fragmented diatoms. Therefore, measurements of particulate biogenic silica (BSi) in different size classes (0.2-0.4-mu-m, 0.4-10-mu-m, 10-20-mu-m, and > 20-mu-m) were made from April through July 1987 in southeastern Lake Michigan to assess the importance of diatom fragments to chemical estimates of BSi. During the spring diatom bloom, the period of maximum BSi concentrations, the greatest percentage of BSi (86%) was found in the microplankton size fraction (> 10-mu-m) associated with living diatoms. By contrast, following thermal stratification, when dissolved silica was depleted from epilimnetic waters, particles < 10-mu-m in size dominated and averaged 52% of total BSi. This fraction contained mostly fragmented diatom frustules. Our estimate of non-living diatoms is consistent with previous studies showing that, following the spring diatom bloom, 40% to 60% of total diatom abundance is non-living. Seasonal decreases in epilimnetic BSi, declining from 11.3-mu-mol L-1 in late April to an average of 1.96-mu-mol L-1 during the stratified period, were due primarily to loss of the largest size fraction (> 20-mu-m) which decreased from 76% of total BSi in April to 36% in July. BSi < 10-mu-m varied by less than a factor of two throughout the study period, averaging 3.23 +/- 2.79-mu-mol L-1. Particles 0.2-0.4-mu-m averaged 0.277 +/- 0.178-mu-mol L-1. These particles are probably produced through frustule dissolution, seetle slowly, and may lead to enhanced BSi recycling rates.

J	Sorjonen, J				Sorjonen, J			Long-term constancy of two rain-call dialects of the Chaffinch Fringilla coelebs in Finnish and Russian Karelia:: a consequence of site-fidelity?	ORNIS FENNICA												According to old Finnish ornithological literature, two different rain-call dialects of the Chaffinch existed in eastern Finland at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. In this work I studied the current existence and range of distribution of different rain-call dialect areas in Finnish and Russian Karelia. Rain-call vocalization is strongly connected to breeding time and uttered only by males. However, males sang the full song five times as often as they uttered the rain-call in Finland and three times as often as they uttered the rain-call in the Karelian Isthmus. The proportion of rain-call of all vocalizations (song and rain-call) increased from morning towards evening and from spring to the middle of summer. Males that uttered the "huit" dialect sang the real song relatively more often than males that uttered the "krik" dialect. In the study area of about 60 000 km(2), there were only two large dialect areas. The "huit" dialect occurred in the northwestern part (eastern Finland and the northern part of the Karelian Isthmus) and "kriek" occurred in the southeastern part (central and southern parts of the Karelian Isthmus and on the eastern coast of Lake Ladoga) of the study area. The rain-call dialects were not related to specific habitat types. The two dialects occured both in coniferous and deciduous forests. Between the two dialect areas is a 50 to 180 km wide sympatric zone in which both dialects were found and where every year some males uttered "hybrid" calls and some were also bilingual. The sympatric zone, where both dialects occurred, was biased northwards from the line where both dialects were equally common (50%). The two dialect areas seemed to have remained rather constant for least 120 years. The strong persistence presumably results from the strong site-fidelity of the adult breeders and from the weak dispersal rate of yearlings (+1 year old).																			0030-5685						2001	78	2					73	82																WOS:000168799500003

We calculated daily variations in neutral sugars and amino acids of the phytoplankton and estimated the efficiency of the increases in sugars and amino acids relative to photosynthetic activities. Only a small portion of carbon incorporated via photosynthesis was used for synthesis of sugars and amino acids during the incubation periods. The percentage increase in neutral sugars plus amino acids compared to photosynthetic rates ranged from 3.7 to 26.9% with an average of 12.8%. These findings suggest that large amounts of photosynthates were not used for the synthesis of cell components of phytoplankton and were lost through processes such as excretion and respiration.																			0018-8158					JUL 21	1995	308	2					109	116		10.1007/BF00007395	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007395													WOS:A1995TA02200003

Using paleoecological records, these two aspects were examined in the alpine zone of the Taibai Mountains (elevation, 3767 m) in monsoon-dominated East Asia since the middle Holocene. Proxies for the productivity of vegetation and severity of soil erosion from high-resolution alpine lacustrine records show that the productivity was closely related to mean annual temperature and soil erosion, to summer precipitation from the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM). Specifically, when the mean annual temperature was low and precipitation was abundant, during 5800-4000 calendar years before the present (cal. yr BP), the alpine ecosystem was characterized by low vegetation productivity and severe soil erosion. However, the productivity increased and soil erosion decreased from 4000 cal. yr BP onwards. These results highlight the role of paleoecological evidence in studying ecosystem services on longer time scales, which is significant in making policies for sustainable development under climate change in regions for which such long-term monitoring data are not available.					; Chen, Deliang/A-5107-2013; Yin, Yi/U-9952-2019; Ciais, Philippe/A-6840-2011	WU, Xiuchen/0000-0003-0396-7439; Cheng, Ying/0000-0001-7732-9806													1674-7313	1869-1897				OCT	2021	64	10					1774	1783		10.1007/s11430-020-9757-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11430-020-9757-1		AUG 2021											WOS:000681590200001

The existence of this community depends on the seasonal water level changes of the unregulated, prealpine Lake Constance. Long-term monitoring indicates that the typical species of the Deschampsietum rhenanae and their competitors may be strongly affected by extreme water levels. An earlier onset of the water level increase in spring could potentially pose a threat to the Deschampsietum rhenanae, especially if the water level rises before seed ripening in the Deschampsietum rhenanae.																			0075-9511					MAY	2004	34	1-2					22	28		10.1016/S0075-9511(04)80018-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0075-9511(04)80018-5													WOS:000222030800004

Infection strategies of different chytrids in a diatom spring bloom	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Diatom blooms are often accompanied by an increase in parasitic chytrids that kill the host cells, which they are infecting, and can contribute to the decline of the bloom. However, host specificity and range of these chytrids are currently poorly understood. Low host specificity would enable the parasites to opportunistically infect any diatom species, while specialisation on infecting specific high-biomass species could result in high prevalence and rapid spread of infection. We investigated such host-parasite interactions by monitoring the diverse diatom spring bloom in lake Erken using amplicon sequencing. We also performed infection experiments with two different, newly isolated chytrid species and several diatom cultures from the bloom. Chytridiomycota displayed the highest relative abundance of all parasitic lineages and were probably physically attached to larger organisms. Since the chytrids reached maximum abundance shortly after a peak in diatom reads, they were probably infecting these important primary producers. Phylogenetic analyses of the isolated chytrid strains identified them as members of the classes Rhizophydiales and Lobulomycetales. The infection experiments revealed high host specificity in these two chytrids targeting different diatom species. The experimental results supported statistical analyses of the environmental sequencing data, which suggested the presence of two different infection strategies: the most abundant chytrid species were specialised on infecting dominant diatom genera (i.e. Stephanodiscus, Aulacoseira, Asterionella), while rarer chytid species infected a range of less abundant diatoms.					; Lindström, Eva/H-5930-2016; Langenheder, Silke/C-9614-2017	Sassenhagen, Ingrid/0000-0002-5969-2289; Langenheder, Silke/0000-0002-5245-9935; Lindstrom, Eva/0000-0001-8920-3071													0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	2023	68	6					972	986		10.1111/fwb.14079	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.14079		MAR 2023											WOS:000961670800001
J	Duchesne, L; Ouimet, R; Houle, D				Duchesne, Louis; Ouimet, Rock; Houle, Daniel			Nutrient transfer by leaf litterfall during a sugar maple decline episode at Lake Clair watershed, Qu,bec, Canada	PLANT ECOLOGY												In a declining sugar maple (SM) stand, we tested the hypothesis that an increasing relative abundance of American beech (AB) and yellow birch (YB) would improve litter quality by providing a higher proportion of litterfall richer in base cations and lower in acidity. From 1989 to 2006, SM leaf fall diminished from 59% (1,718 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) to 36% (915 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) of the total leaf fall biomass. Overall, the increase in AB and YB litterfall compensated for the SM decrease, resulting in constant annual leaf litterfall fluxes (2,803 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) over the period studied. However, because the leaf litter for AB and YB had Ca and Mg concentrations 2-3 times higher than did SM, Ca and Mg concentrations and fluxes in leaf litterfall significantly increased between 1989 and 2006. Leaf litterfall of AB and YB also has a higher base/acid ratio than SM. Consequently, changes in forest composition following SM decline led to a clear improvement in litterfall quality in terms of base cations content and fluxes and acid-base properties.					; Ouimet, Rock/IQS-0362-2023; Duchesne, Louis/KEH-9796-2024	Duchesne, Louis/0000-0001-6784-445X; Ouimet, Rock/0000-0003-1282-2493; 													1385-0237	1573-5052				JUN	2010	208	2					213	221		10.1007/s11258-009-9699-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-009-9699-8													WOS:000277182100003
J	MURRAY, TE				MURRAY, TE			THE CORRELATION BETWEEN IRON SULFIDE PRECIPITATION AND HYPOLIMNETIC PHOSPHORUS ACCUMULATION DURING ONE SUMMER IN A SOFTWATER LAKE	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												During late summer, 1992, the water immediately overlying the sediment in the anoxic hypolimnion of Crystal Lake, Conn., was saturated with ferrous sulfide (FeS). The average solubility product (pK(sp)) at the bottom of the hypolimnion was 3.25, which is consistent with other lake and laboratory studies and is in the range of both amorphous FeS and mackinawite. The precipitation of iron sulfide removed Fe2+ and HS- from the water column, and acid volatile sulfide (AVS) accumulated in the top 6-8 cm of the sediment. Pyrite was formed at deeper depths and did not increase during the study. The accumulation of AVS in the sediment was correlated with an increased accumulation of phosphorus in the water column. The rate of accumulation of phosphorus in the hypolimnion was greatest when iron was lost to the sediment as AVS. The statistically significant link between iron storage in the sediment and phosphorus accumulation in the overlying water suggests that reoxidation of ferrous iron to ferric (hydr)oxides is decreased, and therefore precipitation of ferric phosphate is limited.																			0706-652X					JUN	1995	52	6					1190	1194		10.1139/f95-115	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f95-115													WOS:A1995TA79400006

Natural Hazards in a Changing World: Methods for Analyzing Trends and Non-Linear Changes	EARTHS FUTURE												Estimating the frequency and magnitude of natural hazards largely hinges on stationary models, which do not account for changes in the climatological, hydrological, and geophysical baseline conditions. Using five diverse case studies encompassing various natural hazard types, we present advanced statistical and machine learning methods to analyze and model transient states from long-term inventory data. A novel storminess metric reveals increasing European winter windstorm severity from 1950 to 2010. Non-stationary extreme value models quantify trends, seasonal shifts, and regional differences in extreme precipitation for Germany between 1941 and 2021. Utilizing quantile sampling and empirical mode decomposition on 148 years of daily weather and discharge data in the European Alps, we assess the impacts of changing snow cover, precipitation, and anthropogenic river network modifications on river runoff. Moreover, a probabilistic framework estimates return periods of glacier lake outburst floods in the Himalayas, demonstrating large differences in 100-year flood levels. Utilizing a Bayesian change point algorithm, we track the onset of increased seismicity in the southern central United States and find correlation with wastewater injections into deep wells. In conclusion, data science reveals transient states for very different natural hazard types, characterized by diverse forms of change, ranging from gradual trends to sudden change points and from altered seasonality to overall intensity variations. In synergy with the physical understanding of Earth science, we gain important new insights into the dynamics of the studied hazards and their possible mechanisms. According to global databases on natural hazard events and associated risks, there has been a noteworthy escalation in the extent of economic losses during past decades. It is important but difficult to distinguish and disentangle trends due to changing hazard occurrence or damage potential. Accurately quantifying altered hazards requires high-quality data sets and robust statistical methodologies. Here, we present recent progress in earth and data science toward a quantitative assessment of natural hazards in a changing world. We show that winter storms have become more frequent and more severe in Europe; that extreme precipitation in Germany shows seasonal shifts and changing intensities with regional variation; that river runoff in Central Europe is changing due to modifications of the river network, declining snowpacks, and changes in precipitation; that frequency of glacier lake outburst floods in the Himalayas have remained unchanged over the past 30 years despite rapid glacier melt and lake growth; and that earthquake activity in Oklahoma (USA) has increased with the onset of wastewater injection wells. We infer that recent advances in data science can efficiently provide new knowledge from big data sets, but interpreting these results needs a solid understanding and rather detailed analysis of the underlying processes. Time-dependent approaches are key to capture changing hazards, with diverse altered frequencies, intensities, timing or spatial occurrences Advances in data-driven methods and increasing availability of geodata foster new ways to detect changes in natural hazards Over-simplification or averaging over large scales in time or space cause severe information loss and may hide the mechanisms for change					Bronstert, Axel/AAA-3314-2022; Vogel, Kristin/H-6055-2019; Peter, Martina/G-2284-2018	Veh, Georg/0000-0003-4430-2601; Rottler, Erwin/0000-0003-3072-2189; Bronstert, Axel/0000-0002-6369-8536; Vogel, Kristin/0000-0002-3692-6492														2328-4277				MAY	2024	12	5							e2023EF003553	10.1029/2023EF003553	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023EF003553													WOS:001230169600001

The distribution of ammonia-oxidizing betaproteobacteria in stands of Black mangroves (Avicennia germinans)	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												The distribution of species of aerobic chemolitho-autotrophic microorganisms such as ammonia-oxidizing bacteria are governed by pH, salinity, and temperature as well as the availability of oxygen, ammonium, carbon dioxide, and other inorganic elements required for growth. Impounded mangrove forests in the Indian River Lagoon, a coastal estuary on the east coast of Florida, are dominated by mangroves, especially stands of Black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) that differ in the size and density of individual plants. In March 2009, the management of one impoundment was changed to a regime of pumping estuarine water into the impoundment at critical times of the year to eliminate breeding sites for noxious insects. We collected soil samples in three different Black mangrove habitats before and after the change in management to determine the impacts of the altered hydrologic regimes on the distribution of 16s rRNA genes belonging to ammonia-oxidizing betaproteobacteria (beta-AOB). We also sampled soils in an adjacent impoundment in which there had not been any hydrologic alteration. At the level of 97% mutual similarity in the 16s rRNA gene, 13 different operational taxonomic units were identified; the majority related to the lineages of Nitrosomonas marina (45% of the total clones), Nitrosomonas sp. Nm143 (23%), and Nitrosospira cluster 1 (19%). Long-term summer flooding of the impoundment in 2009, after initiation of the pumping regime, reduced the percentage of N. marina by half between 2008 and 2010 in favor of the two other major lineages and the potential ammonia-oxidizing activity decreased by an average of 73%. Higher interstitial salinities, probably due to a prolonged winter drought, had a significant effect on the composition of the beta-AOB in March 2009 compared to March 2008: Nitrosomonas sp. Nm143 was replaced by Nitrosospira cluster 1 as the second most important lineage. There were small, but significant differences in the bacterial communities between the flooded and non-flooded impoundments. There were also differences in the community composition of the bacteria in the three Black mangrove habitats. N. marina was most dominant in all three habitats, but was partly replaced by Nitrosospira cluster 1 in sites dominated by sparsely distributed trees and by Nitrosomonas sp. Nm143 in sites characterized by taller, more densely distributed Black mangrove trees.

Two ignimbrite flows have been recognized in the pre-caldera stage. The earlier of the two occurred after basaltic lavas formed along extensional fissures. The latter, which forms the main subject of this paper, was a major flow associated with the development of the Nemrut caldera. The pyroclastic deposits of the Nemrut volcano in the pre-caldera stage are divided into three phases on the basis of palaeosols that separate them. The first phase includes plinian pumice falls and a pyroclastic flow deposit. The major ignimbrite occurs in the second pyroclastic phase and is here subdivided into three sub-layers based on colour, internal grading, size of pumice and lithic clasts, and the degree of welding. The third and last pyroclastic phase was dominated by plinian pumice and ash-fall deposits. The occurrence of palaeosols between pyroclastic phases suggests that there were periods of inactivity between the eruptions. Formation of the Nemrut caldera is thought to have resulted from eruptions of pyroclastic materials with a volume of about 62.6 km(3).

Nitrification was detected in the water column during stratification and was maximal within a 2 m deep zone centered on a depth of 8.0 m in the metalimnion and upper hypolimnion, where numbers of autotrophic nitrifying bacteria were highest. Calculated rates of nitrification in this zone based on BOD (biochemical O2 demand) measurements. N-Serve-sensitive bicarbonate incorporation, regression analysis of the daily changes in nitrate-N at 8.0 m and integrated changes in nitrate-N throughout the metalimnion and hypolimnion during late Aug. 1976 were, respectively, 55.4, 45.0, 22.4 and 39 .mu.g N l-1 day-1. The importance of sediment-derived ammonium for nitrifying bacteria and the fate of nitrate produced by nitrification are discussed.

Modeling the effect of glacier recession on streamflow response using a coupled glacio-hydrological model	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												We describe an integrated spatially distributed hydrologic and glacier dynamic model, and use it to investigate the effect of glacier recession on streamflow variations for the upper Bow River basin, a tributary of the South Saskatchewan River, Alberta, Canada. Several recent studies have suggested that observed decreases in summer flows in the South Saskatchewan River are partly due to the retreat of glaciers in the river's headwaters. Modeling the effect of glacier changes on streamflow response in river basins such as the South Saskatchewan is complicated due to the inability of most existing physically based distributed hydrologic models to represent glacier dynamics. We compare predicted variations in glacier extent, snow water equivalent (SWE), and streamflow discharge with satellite estimates of glacier area and terminus position, observed glacier mass balance, observed streamflow and snow water-equivalent measurements, respectively over the period of 1980-2007. Observations of multiple hydroclimatic variables compare well with those simulated with the coupled hydrology-glacier model. Our results suggest that, on average, the glacier melt contribution to the Bow River flow upstream of Lake Louise is approximately 22% in summer. For warm and dry years, however, the glacier melt contribution can be as large as 47% in August, whereas for cold years, it can be as small as 15% and the timing of the glacier melt signature can be delayed by a month. The development of this modeling approach sets the stage for future predictions of the influence of warming climate on streamflow in partially glacierized watersheds.

CASE STUDY: PUCIOASA ACCUMULATION LAKE, ROMANIA	JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND ARTS												On Romania's territory, after the major floods that took place during the 70s, the hydrotechnical setup of the large rivers that drain the peri-Carpathian areas was made. The purpose of building these anthropogenic dam lakes is complex, given that extreme hydrological phenomena occurred in late spring and early summer, caused by a significant rainwater supply (about 70%), the difference being made up by the underground supply. Such a hydrotechnical setup was made in the Subcarpathian areas, on large rivers, to mitigate flood waves, but also to create water resources to supply local communities. The main problem facing these lakes is the massive silting due on the one hand to the geological and geomorphological characteristics of the Subcarpathians and, on the other hand, to the high degree of anthropization. The Subcarpathians are, from a geological point of view, made up of friable deposits (marls, clays, marl-clays, gypsums, conglomerates), which trigger a series of geomorphological processes of slope erosion (areal streaming, ravine creation, runoffs, torrential rainfall, and landslides), all of which are involved in the hydrological drainage regime. The Subcarpathians also make up a geographical area with a high density of population and, implicitly, of anthropogenic activities, which under certain conditions favour the erosion and degradation of land. These factors ensure that the solid flow recorded on the Subcarpathian Rivers is between 5-25 million tons/ha per annum. All this leads to the intense silting of anthropogenic lakes, which causes the volume of water stored in the tank to sometimes decrease to 1/3 of its initial volume. Under these conditions, in the extremity of basins, lacustrine plains were formed, and within the dam area, the pelitic sedimentary deposits exceeded 7-10 m in thickness. The aim of this study is to perform a multitemporal analysis of lake silting in the Subcarpathian area by using GIS and integrating the suite of bathymetric elevations and the series of satellite images existing from the time of the lake's construction to present-day.					muratoreanu, george/IZP-8499-2023; pehoiu, gica/D-3099-2012; Murarescu, Ovidiu/C-4284-2012														1844-9581						2021		4					1133	1142		10.46939/J.Sci.Arts-21.4-b08	http://dx.doi.org/10.46939/J.Sci.Arts-21.4-b08													WOS:000756665800024

Distribution and assessment of heavy metals in the aquatic environment of Lake Manzala, Egypt	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Analysis of trace metals from sediment and fish collected from eight locations in Lake Manzala, Egypt, during May, June and July of 2011, indicated anthropogenic impacts. The highest concentrations of metals, except Mn and Sr, were detected at Bahr Al-Baqar (S1) which drains from Cairo. At the other sampling locations, the concentrations of selected trace metals fall below the levels of concern while the geoaccumulation index (I-geo) suggests unpolluted conditions for the majority of the studied metals at most sites. However, near the Bahr Al-Baqar (S1) drain concentrations of Ag, Hg and Zn fall above the Long and Morgan's (1990) effects range low (ERL) while Pb was above their effects range median (ERM). I-geo values suggest unpolluted to moderately polluted condition for As and Sn, moderately polluted conditions for Zn, moderate to extremely polluted conditions for Ag, and severely to extremely polluted conditions for Pb at Bahr. Al-Baqar. Two sites (Legan, S5, and Al-Ginka, S8) were indicated by I-geo as moderately polluted for Ag while two other sites (West of Bashar, S3, and Al Dehdy, S6) were indicated as unpolluted to moderately polluted for Ag. The Legan and Al-Ginka sites were also indicated as being moderately polluted for Zn. Similar to the sediments, the highest concentrations of metals in fish tissue were from Bahr Al-Baqar (S1). Al concentrations at all sites were comparable to concentrations known to cause lesions in fish. At all sites concentrations of selected trace metals in fish tissue were below the limits set by the FAO. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The impact of these activities on stands of Equisetum fluviatile in a northern Swedish lake was investigated. The areas of open water created by the muskrats were estimated from IR air photographs, taken in July, on 3 occasions during a 5-yr period. During the first 3 yr, with low muskrat densities, areas of open water were estimated to represent removal of about 1% of the Equisetum stands. In the summer following a population peak the total area of open H2O had increased to about 4%. In that summer there were, on average, about 160 such areas per ha and their combined perimeter length was about 1.5 km. The many small areas created by the muskrats were mostly very irregular in shape, each with a long perimeter in relation to its area. If not too numerous, the muskrats have a positive effect on the waterfowl population in well-vegetated lakes by increasing the feeding areas available for adults and young birds.																			0029-8549	1432-1939					1979	38	1					101	106		10.1007/BF00347828	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00347828								28309074					WOS:A1979GG76000010

We here evaluated such potential changes by analyzing six tree-ring width (TRW) and maximum latewood density (MXD) chronologies from northern, central and southern boreal forests in Finland (60 degrees N-69 degrees N). Besides latitudinal effects, differing micro-sites (lakeshore and inland) were considered to evaluate the influence of ground water access on twentieth-century tree-ring formation and climate sensitivity. Overall, the boreal MXD chronologies appeared less affected by micro-site conditions compared to the TRW chronologies. Along the boreal transect, mean growth rates decrease with increasing latitude, but the ratio of earlywood-to-latewood (approximate to 70%/approximate to 30%) remains stable. However, latewood is slightly denser at the dry inland micro-sites. The correlations with climate data showed that TRW and MXD at all sites are positively related with summer temperature. The MXD chronologies are also negatively correlated with precipitation, a feature that is largely missing in TRW. A recent trend toward wetter and cloudier conditions in the study region coincides with a shift of the MXD signal from a distinct temperature limitation toward an additional sensitivity to precipitation, which in turn stimulated the trees' competition for sunlight.

The main objective of the present work is to study the physical and chemical properties of the lake and its relation with the phytoplankton communities, chlorophyll-(a) under bar as well as diversity and Eutrophication index. The studies revealed that, the pH values lie in alkaline side, with wide range of fluctuation (7.15-8.5), the total suspended matter was relatively high (18.2-149 mg l(-1)), high values of dissolved oxygen (5.17-11.29 ml l(-1)) and high concentration of nutrient salts, (nitrate ranged between (3.4-44.7 mu mole l(-1)), nitrite (0.42-15.95 mu mole l(-1)), ammonia (1.46-50.60 mu mole l(-1)), phosphate (0.63-14.83 mu mole l(-1)), and silicate (6.54 to 119.3 mu mole l(-1)). Chlorophyll-(a) under bar concentration showed a wide range of fluctuation (13.8-127.4 mu g/l) and the highest value were recorded at the western region of the lake. Phytoplankton counts showed a pronounced increase (1.9 x 10(6) units l(-1)) as compared with previous studies, a total of 170 species were identified represented mainly by Bacillariophyceae (44.8% to the total community) comprising 68 species, Chlorophyceae (39.99%) 54 species, followed by Cyanobacteria (9.52%) 26 species, Euglenophyceae (5.63%) 15 species. Phytoplankton standing crop attained the highest counts at the western sector particularly at station X during spring and summer (6.7 x 10(6) and 4.1 x 10(6) units l(-1) respectively) due to the dominance of Bacillariohycean species Stephanodiscus phytoplankton diversity was high and showed widely range (1.47-3.66 nats). A series of stepwise regression equations describing the dependence of phytoplankton standing crop, its main groups and diversity index on the changes of the most biotic prevailing conditions were given and discussed. In general, the results showed that the Lake is considered as a eutrophic area. This phenomenon observed in the body of the lake water that receives large influxes of nutrients, which reflects high phytoplankton counts, diversity index and Chlorophyll-(a) under bar.																			0049-6979					MAY	2006	172	1-4					129	150		10.1007/s11270-005-9066-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-005-9066-x													WOS:000237124700009

For processing the SeaWiFS satellite data, the atmospheric correction was adapted to the case of Lake Baikal. Chlorophyll as a proxy for phytoplankton was quantified using global NASA ocean colour algorithms OC2 and OC4. In cases of no optical interferences by terrigenous input, the calculated chlorophyll concentrations in clear pelagic waters were within +/- 30% accuracy with the CONTINENT cruise data during the summers of 2001 and 2002. Within this range of accuracy, the SeaWiFS time series will be able to show the seasonal variations of chlorophyll of specified bio-optical provinces of Lake Baikal and of CONTINENT sites. In this study, the suspended matter as a proxy for the terrigenous input was calculated according to an empirical algorithm using ground truth data in the time frame of flooding events in summer 2001. The approach chosen correlates the suspended matter concentration with the remotely sensed parameter of 'attenuation coefficient' to account for the organic-rich terrigenous input that originates from the swampy watersheds. Seasonal and spatial information that is provided by the analyses of the SeaWiFS satellite data will assist paleoclimate researchers to interpret the autochthonous and allochthonous influences at the CONTINENT coring sites.

To resolve this discrepancy is critical for understanding how climate evolves and also for evaluating current global warming. Here we report a branched GDGTs-based mean annual air temperature (MAAT) reconstruction from the sediments of Huguangyan Maar Lake in southeast China and validate it using historical documentary evidence and instrumental data. The reconstructed MAAT indicates distinct changes during the last deglaciation (Oldest Dryas, Bolling-Allerod, Younger Dryas). During the Holocene, temperatures gradually increased from the end of the Younger Dryas to-7.0 cal ka BP, followed by a stepped decrease until present. This terrestrial temperature record differs with model simulations and proxy sea surface temperature records of the Holocene, suggesting that our study reveals a regional climate pattern that was not adequately documented in previous research. The temperature variations in the Huguangyan Maar Lake are coupled with the forcings both from the high latitude (the Arctic) and low latitude (the Intertropical Convergence Zone). The decrease in ice volume and winter monsoon are the most prominent forcings that controlled the regional temperature evolution from the Last Glacial Maximum to the beginning of the middle Holocene, while the temper-ature variations during the middle and late Holocene were consistent with the southward shifts of the Intertropical Convergence Zone.

Hydrolysis and mineralization rates were much higher in sinking particles, resuspendable particles, and bottom sediments than in seawater. The cell-specific mineralization rate of free-living bacteria in seawater was several times higher than that of particle-associated bacteria at the other three sites. Conversely, no significant difference was observed in the cell-specific ecto-enzymatic hydrolysis rate. These results indicated different strategies in the utilization of organic matter: free-living bacteria actively respire low-molecular-weight compounds produced from the high-molecular-weight compounds resulting from extracellular enzyme activity of particle-associated bacteria. Both hydrolysis and mineralization were higher in sinking particles than in the other three sites. Hydrolysis rates were higher in resuspendable particles than in bottom sediments. Furthermore, leucine aminopeptidase and mineralization rates tended to be highest during winter in all four sites within the water column. These results suggest that the microbial decomposition of organic matter is stimulated by the resuspension of bottom sediments, especially during winter, when vertical mixing is relatively strong.																			0919-9268	1444-2906				JUL	2017	83	4					635	647		10.1007/s12562-017-1098-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12562-017-1098-9													WOS:000404933700015

Distinct migratory and non-migratory ecotypes of an endemic New Zealand eleotrid (Gobiomorphus cotidianus) -: implications for incipient speciation in island freshwater fish species	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Background: Many postglacial lakes contain fish species with distinct ecomorphs. Similar evolutionary scenarios might be acting on evolutionarily young fish communities in lakes of remote islands. One process that drives diversification in island freshwater fish species is the colonization of depauperate freshwater environments by diadromous (migratory) taxa, which secondarily lose their migratory behaviour. The loss of migration limits dispersal and gene flow between distant populations, and, therefore, is expected to facilitate local morphological and genetic differentiation. To date, most studies have focused on interspecific relationships among migratory species and their non-migratory sister taxa. We hypothesize that the loss of migration facilitates intraspecific morphological, behavioural, and genetic differentiation between migratory and non-migratory populations of facultatively diadromous taxa, and, hence, incipient speciation of island freshwater fish species. Results: Microchemical analyses of otolith isotopes (Sr-88, Ba-137 and Ca-43) differentiated migratory and non-migratory stocks of the New Zealand endemic Gobiomorphus cotidianus McDowall (Eleotridae). Samples were taken from two rivers, one lake and two geographically-separated outgroup locations. Meristic analyses of oculoscapular lateral line canals documented a gradual reduction of these structures in the non-migratory populations. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprints revealed considerable genetic isolation between migratory and non-migratory populations. Temporal differences in reproductive timing (migratory = winter spawners, non-migratory = summer spawners; as inferred from gonadosomatic indices) provide a prezygotic reproductive isolation mechanism between the two ecotypes. Conclusion: This study provides a holistic look at the role of diadromy in incipient speciation of island freshwater fish species. All four analytical approaches (otolith microchemistry, morphology, spawning timing, population genetics) yield congruent results, and provide clear and independent evidence for the existence of distinct migratory and non-migratory ecotypes within a river in a geographically confined range. The morphological changes within the non-migratory populations parallel interspecific patterns observed in all non-migratory New Zealand endemic Gobiomorphus species and other derived gobiid taxa, a pattern suggesting parallel evolution. This study indicates, for the first time, that distinct ecotypes of island freshwater fish species may be formed as a consequence of loss of migration and subsequent diversification. Therefore, if reproductive isolation persists, these processes may provide a mechanism to facilitate speciation.					van+den+Heuvel, Michael/ABF-1188-2020; Michel, Christian/C-4098-2011; Meyer, Axel/C-9826-2009; Hicks, Brendan/E-4382-2013; Clarke, Andrew/A-7635-2008	Hicks, Brendan/0000-0002-8860-0945; Meyer, Axel/0000-0002-0888-8193; Stolting, Kai N./0000-0003-3498-3343; Clarke, Andrew/0000-0003-2293-1423													1471-2148					FEB 14	2008	8								49	10.1186/1471-2148-8-49	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-8-49								18275608					WOS:000254282800001

We examined the longitudinal and temporal changes occurring in fish assemblages in a hydropeaking single river reservoir between two power plants by using electrofishing along the shoreline, hydroacoustics and test fishing in the open water. A longitudinally changing fish community was found among bottom-dwelling fish in the fast-flowing and highly disturbed upstream part of the reservoir progressing to generalists and pelagic fish in the lentic and most stable environment at the downstream end. The fish assemblage showed temporal patterns as fish density increased during night-time darkness and also towards autumn. Our work provides evidence for gradient effects of flow regulation and contributes to awareness of the effects of disturbance (flow/habitat variability) on biological systems.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG 15	2005	545						257	270		10.1007/s10750-005-3318-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-3318-z													WOS:000231958700021

In communities in northern Canada, especially in winter, a considerable amount of SO2 was liberated locally. It was important to be able to separate local effects from regional or continental ones but most CANSAP stations utilized a single collector, the position of which might not have been representative of the general conditions in the locality. The Schefferville, Quebec [Canada], area presented a good opportunity to evaluate local effects of a small area (1 km2) source in winter as no industrial activity other than ore-extraction took place. The only gaseous contaminants liberated locally were derived from fuel oil and the only particulates came from well-defined mine and dump areas. Measurements of snow pH and dust loading in the Schefferville area were presented including the importance of local gaseous and particulate pollutants. These were compared with pollutants from distant sources and used to assess the significance of pollution patterns.																			0008-3658	1541-0064					1980	24	3					286	291		10.1111/j.1541-0064.1980.tb00343.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0064.1980.tb00343.x													WOS:A1980KR34200005
J	WILLIAMS, JB				WILLIAMS, JB			A STUDY OF SUMMER MORTALITY FACTORS FOR NATURAL-POPULATIONS OF CHYDORIDAE (CLADOCERA)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												To test the hypothesis that predation controls summer population growth of the Chydoridae in Lake Itasca, Minnesota [USA], 2 types of in situ predator-exclusion experiments were conducted. The 1st series of experiments excluded all predators from chydorid populations by enclosing the chydorids within clear plexiglass chambers suspended in their natural habitat. The 2nd series of experiments excluded fish, but not invertebrates, from chydorids by placing polyethylene exclosures directly on the submerged vegetation. The concomitant abundance of natural chydorid populations was monitored by pattern sampling adjacent vegetation. Populations of Chydoridae that were protected from all predation increased exponentially, while natural populations remaining exposed to predation decreased dramatically. Populations of Chydoridae that were protected from all predation decreased dramatically. Populations protected from predation by fish but not invertebrates were not significantly different from unprotected control populations. Thus, predation by fish and invertebrates combined was sufficient to limit chydorid density. The hypothesis that the predation was due primarily to fish was not supported. Because chydorids are smaller and less accessible than preferred prey items, fish may be able to use them significantly only during periods of high chydorid abundance.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1983	107	2					131	139		10.1007/BF00017428	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00017428													WOS:A1983RT27700004

Measurements were conducted just after deep circulation from the end of March to the end of May 2005. Lake Ikeda and Lake Towada did not undergo a complete turnover. Both showed meromictic features with a clear interface separating the recirculated mixolimnion from the deeper monimolimnion. Lake Tazawa and Lake Toya showed a complete turnover in winter 2004/05, while in Lake Kuttara and Lake Shikotsu, a deep water body remained throughout winter due to pressure effects on the temperature of maximum density. Although these deep waters were never fully recycled into the mixolimnion, they presented themselves as well supplied with oxygen and well circulated within themselves. Where overturn had not been complete small gradients in the oxygen profile, pH profiles and electrical conductivity profiles could be detected. However only in Lake Towada were concentrations of dissolved substances and gradients high enough to have decisive impact on the circulation pattern.

Upon completion of breeding activities and before the flightless period, all mallard drakes departed the area; this exodus peaked during early June. Of the non-brood hens 8 of 23 remained on the area, whereas 26 of 51 of the brooding hens spent the flightless period on their breeding areas. Thirty-nine percent of the mallard hens on the area in the spring were present at the beginning of their flightless period. Fifty percent of the drake wood ducks and 41% of the hens left the breeding area before flightlessness. Their timing was similar to that of mallards. The flightless period began in mid-June for wood duck drakes and lasted into early Oct. for some mallard hens. All late molting mallard and wood duck hens reared broods that same year. A minimum of 35% of the spring mallard hens remained on the area at the beginning of hunting season (early Oct.). About 17% of the wood duck males and 42% of the females breeding locally remained on the area until hunting began. Eleven of 51 mallards and 4 of 25 wood ducks that reared broods were killed on the study area compared with 2 of 23 for non-brood mallards and 1 of 20 for non-brood wood duck hens. Principal habitats used by post-breeding mallards were bays of large lakes and river marshes. Wood ducks tended to use similar habitat but also frequented small woodland ponds. During the flightless period both species remained mostly in areas with abundant emergent cover.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1977	41	3					345	359		10.2307/3800504	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3800504													WOS:A1977DZ17700001

However, the severity of the phenomenon has increased over time, and late-summer dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations have typically been <3 mg L-1 in recent years. In situ, high-frequency observations of oxygen depletion at multiple depths reveal that while DO consumption during stratification occurs most rapidly in the metalimnion, there is synchrony between DO time series extending into the hypolimnion. A biochemical oxygen demand-based modeling approach suggests that much of the relationship between water depth and respiration rates can be explained by differences in water temperature. The amount of labile organic matter present throughout the water column at the onset of stratification seems to be a primary determinant of the severity of the annual metalimnetic DO minimum in late summer. Productivity has increased in the lake as a result of increased nutrient loading and is the likely driver of the decrease in minimum DO concentrations. In addition, the onset and duration of stratification is an important factor in determining the severity of the DO minimum.

Limnology for the ornithologist: effects of Lake Maggiore water level on migratory flows	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Wetlands are widely recognised as the most critical stop-over locations along migration flyways. Wetland ecology is mostly influenced by water levels and water regimes. This research focuses on Bolle di Magadino (Switzerland), an important stop-over site on Lake Maggiore, artificially regulated by a dam. In this work we examined how the artificial flooding of a wetland affects the use of this stop-over site by migrating passerines during spring. Bird presence in the area was evaluated using both data collected at the ringing station located in the wetlands and the bird traffic rate (BTR) supplied by the BirdScan MR1, an avian vertical-looking radar (VLR) capable of automatically detecting and classifying birds in flight. In an attempt to shed light on the effect of lake level on stop- over quality, we i) simulated with GIS the extent of the flooded area and of the different habitat categories as the lake level changes; ii) calculated the relationship between lake level and the ability of stop-overing birds to acquire trophic resources; iii) verified that the flux of passerines below 500 m above ground level measured by radar could be used as a proxy for the number of stop-overing birds; iv) calculated the relationship between the number of birds leaving the stop-over and the lake level. While the number of ringed passerines has proven to be representative of the migratory flow below 500 meters of altitude at the site of interest, a high lake level seems to have a negative impact on the use by some species of the Bolle di Magadino area as a stop-over site during spring. In particular, two of the target species -the blackcap and the reed bunting- have proven to be sensitive to higher water levels. While taking into account the limitations and the relative nature of the results, could be necessary for the competent authorities to take these results into consideration in order to safeguard the Bolle di Magadino's role as an important stop- over area during spring.					; Tattoni, Clara/AAG-6917-2020; Martinoli, Adriano/L-4924-2016; Preatoni, Damiano/A-8621-2010	Tattoni, Clara/0000-0003-1555-5669; Martinoli, Adriano/0000-0003-0298-0869; Preatoni, Damiano/0000-0001-8760-1316; Giuntini, Silvia/0000-0001-9573-5509													1129-5767	1723-8633					2022	81			2						10.4081/jlimnol.2022.2123	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2022.2123													WOS:001089390500001

During 1975-1976, the standing crop measured as chlorophyll-a was 5.5 times greater in Padarn than in Peris and the production rate, determined by the 14CO2 method, was faster by 3.4 times. These differences were attributed to the higher concentrations of P in the lower lake caused by treated sewage effluent. Incident light intensity, which was slightly lower in Peris due to mountain shading, and temperature, which was 1-4.degree. C higher in Padarn, made little significant contribution to these differences during the summer. The reduced transparency of Padarn water, compared with that of Peris, resulted from denser phytoplankton crops in Padarn. During the summer, Padarn exhibited CO2 depletion which correlated with the chlorophyll concentration. Light inhibition at the surfaces of both lakes correlated with solar radiation intensity. However, the relationship between pigment content and maximum photosynthetic rate was poor. Extracellular products accounted for about 16% of the total production in the lakes. Uptake of 14C-labeled acetate was low compared with that of 14CO2 uptake.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1978	8	1					9	23		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1978.tb01421.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1978.tb01421.x													WOS:A1978EL63300002

Stable isotope estimates of evaporation : inflow and water residence time for lakes across the United States as a tool for national lake water quality assessments	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We used water delta H-2 and delta O-18 from ca. 1000 lakes sampled in the 2007 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Lakes Assessment (NLA) to assess two hydrological variables-evaporation as a percentage of inflow (E : I) and water residence time (tau) for summer 2007. Using a population survey design, sampled lakes were distributed across the conterminous U.S., and results were scaled to the inference population (similar to 50,000 U.S. lakes). These hydrologic variables were related to lake nutrients and biological condition to illustrate their usefulness in national water quality monitoring efforts. For 50% of lakes, evaporation was, 25% of inflow, with values ranging up to 113% during the 2007 summer. Residence time was, 0.52 yr for half of the lakes and, 1.12 yr for 75% of lakes. Categorizing lakes by flow regime, 66.1% of lakes were flow-though lakes (60% or more of the water flows through the lake, E : I < 0.4), 33.6% were restricted-basin lakes (40% or more of the lake inflow evaporates, 0.4 < E: I < 1), and < 0.3% were closed basin (all water entering the lake leaves through evaporation, E : I > 1). While climate patterns drove some of the spatial patterns of E : I and tau, variation in lake depth and watershed size (influencing precipitation volume) were also significant drivers. Lake hydrochemistry was strongly correlated to E: I and more weakly related to tau. Lakes in poor biological condition (based on a predictive model of planktonic taxa) were significantly more evaporated than lakes in good biological condition.					Brooks, J.

Acid chloride sulfate waters of the Rio Agrio drainage basin on the northwestern flank are the only waters on Poas that are affected by leakage of acid brines from the summit hydrothermal system. Acid sulfate waters found on the northwestern flank are produced by the interaction of surface and shallow groundwater with dry and wet acid deposition of SO2 and H2SO4 aerosols, respectively. The acid deposition is caused by a plume of acid gases that is released by a shallow magma body located beneath the active crater of Poas. No evidence for a deep reservoir of neutral pH sodium chloride brine is found at Poas. The lack of discharge of sodium chloride waters at Poas is attributed to two factors: (1) the presence of a relatively volatile-rich magma body degassing at shallow depths (< 1 km) into a high level summit groundwater system; and (2) the hydrologic structure of the volcano in which high rates of recharge combine with rapid lateral flow of shallow groundwater to prevent deep-seated sodium chloride fluids from ascending to the surface. The shallow depth of the volatile-rich magma results in the degassing of large quantities of SO2 and HCl. These gases are readily hydrolyzed and quickly mix with meteoric water to form a reservoir of acid chloride-sulfate brine in the summit hydrothermal system. High recharge rates and steep hydraulic gradients associated with elevated topographic features of the summit region promote lateral flow of acid brines generated in the summit hydrothermal system. However, the same high recharge rates and steep hydraulic gradients prevent lateral flow of deep-seated fluids, thereby masking the presence of any sodium chloride brines that may exist in deeper parts of the volcanic edifice. Structural, stratigraphic, and topographic features of Poas Volcano are critical in restricting flow of acid brines to the northwestern flank of the volcano. A permeable lava-lahar sequence that outcrops in the Rio Agrio drainage basin forms a hydraulic conduit between the crater lake and acid chloride sulfate springs. Spring water residence times are estimated from tritium data and indicate that flow of acid brines from the active crater to the Rio Agrio source springs is relatively rapid (3 to 17 years). Hydraulic conductivity values of the lava-lahar sequence calculated from residence time estimates range from 10(-5) to 10(-7) m/s. These values are consistent with hydraulic conductivity values determined by aquifer tests of fractured and porous lava/pyroclastic sequences at the base of the northwestern flank of the volcano. Fluxes of dissolved rock-forming elements in Rio Agrio indicate that approximately 4300 and 1650 m3 of rock are removed annually from the northwest flank aquifer and the active crater hydrothermal system, respectively. Over the lifetime of the hydrothermal system (100's to 1000's of years), significant increases in aquifer porosity and permeability should occur, in marked contrast to the reduction in permeability that often accompanies hydrothermal alteration in less acidic systems. Average fluxes of fluoride, chloride and sulfur calculated from discharge and compositional data collected in the Rio Agrio drainage basin over the period 1988-1990 are approximately 2, 38 and 30 metric tons/day. These fluxes should be representative of minimum volatile release rates at Poas in the last 10 to 20 years.

The bridge consists of 29 simply-supported steel trusses, each having a 64 m span length, giving a total bridge length of 2029.60 m. To understand the actual behaviour of the bridge, static and dynamic tests on the bridge spans were performed. The bridge was instrumented with strain-gauges mounted on the surface of the bridge members, accelerometers placed on the piers, abutments, and truss members and an optical laser based displacement sensor located at mid-span. Then, a three-dimensional finite element model of the bridge was generated using commercially available finite element analysis software using frame elements, a thick shell, and spring and rigid bar elements. The initial numerical model was calibrated using an optimization procedure based on automatically adjusting the spring constants and rigid bar rigidities with the help of MATLAB. Finally, the validity of the calibrated FE model was examined by the vertical displacement measurements.					caglayan, Barlas/E-6564-2013; TEZER, Ovunc/JVN-5809-2024; Ozakgul, Kadir/AAA-6764-2021	ozakgul, kadir/0000-0002-2666-3836; Tezer, Ovunc/0000-0002-6725-1985; caglayan, barlas ozden/0000-0002-8986-9188													0090-3973	1945-7553				NOV	2015	43	6								10.1520/JTE20140049	http://dx.doi.org/10.1520/JTE20140049													WOS:000369397200015

Five years of seasonal data show the lake to be persistently supersaturated with O2. Oxygen is carried into the lake in glacial meltstreams and is left behind when this water is removed as ice by ablation and sublimation. A diffuse loss of O2 from the lake through the summer moat is suggested. Measured values of the total O2 in the water column indicate that the time scale of O2 turnover is much longer than a year. Based on these results we suggest that the amount of O2 in the water does not change significantly throughout the year and that the lake is also supersaturated with N2.

BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Enumeration of benthic (bottom dwelling) and epiphytic (attached to plants) zebra and quagga mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and D. bugensis, respectively) at Lake Erie near-shore sites in fall of 2000 revealed an unexpected prevalence of the zebra mussel on submerged plants. Even at Buffalo, New York, USA, where benthic dreissenids have been 92-100% quagoa mussel since 1996, zebra mussels constituted 30-61% of epiphytes numerically. This may reflect a partitioning of settling space consistent with interspecific competition. A seasonal epiphytic refugium might allow the zebra mussel to persist even where the benthos is almost exclusively quagga mussel.																			1387-3547						2004	6	1					83	88		10.1023/B:BINV.0000010124.00582.d3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:BINV.0000010124.00582.d3													WOS:000220965900007

A Spaceborne Demonstration of P-Band Signals-of-Opportunity (SoOp) Reflectometry	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												Land-reflected signals from a geosynchronous communication satellite broadcasting in P-band (367.5 MHz) were captured in low Earth orbit (LEO) using a simple dipole antenna. A delay-Doppler map (DDM) was generated through autocorrelation. Estimates of the specular point delay were obtained from the lag of the second peak in the DDM with a bias of 239.4 m and a standard deviation of 44 m (12 m over a frozen lake) with respect to a predicted orbit model. Relative magnitudes of the first and second DDM peaks fell within the range of values predicted using dielectric models for the frozen ground and lake. Finally, retrievals of surface reflection coefficient were generated using a range of realistic values for the transmitter link budget G/T, and these also fell within the range of possible values for the antenna gain pattern. Given the lack of calibration and the large uncertainties in the receiver orbit and attitude, this agreement is sufficient to conclude a successful demonstration of the fundamental principle of single-antenna reflectometry in P-band. P-band reflectometry may offer a new approach to remote sensing of sub-canopy and root-zone soil moisture.

Influence of industrial activity and pollution on the paleoclimate reconstruction from a eutrophic lake in lowland England, UK	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Reliable estimates of Holocene temperatures are important for understanding past climate dynamics, the response of biota to climate change, and validating climate models. Chironomids in lake sediment cores are used widely to quantify past summer temperatures, for which high-latitude and/or high-altitude lakes, remote from human influence, are usually considered appropriate. Temperature inferences from lowland lakes are likely influenced by other variables, specifically eutrophication and industrial pollution, but their reliability has never been tested. We used a Norwegian chironomid-based transfer function (r (2) = 0.91; RMSEP = 1.01 A degrees C) to infer mean July air temperature over the last 200 years, using chironomid assemblages in a core collected from a polluted, nutrient-enriched lake at Speke Hall, Liverpool, England. The chironomid-inferred temperatures correlate significantly with the local instrumental temperature record and follow long-term national temperature trends. These results show that chironomids can be used to produce reliable estimates of past mean July air temperature, even when other variables have also influenced the composition of the chironomid community. These findings underline the value of chironomids as sensitive and reliable quantitative proxies for summer temperature.					; Medeiros, Andrew/I-1947-2019	Medeiros, Andrew/0000-0002-7743-2560; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2018	59	4					397	410		10.1007/s10933-017-9995-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-017-9995-6													WOS:000426572300001

Early Weichselian (MIS 5d and 5c) temperatures and environmental changes in northern Fennoscandia as recorded by chironomids and macroremains at Sokli, northeast Finland	BOREAS												A 25-m-long sediment record spanning the time from the Eemian to the Holocene was recovered from Sokli, northeast Finland. This study focuses on a 6-m-long sediment interval that is dated to the Early Weichselian period (MIS 5d and 5c) and consists of lacustrine and fluvial deposits. Using chironomid remains, botanical and zoological macroremains as well as sediment lithology, we were able to reconstruct past changes in the environment, including climate. The results indicate that the site was situated on a flood-plain during the latter stages of MIS 5d (Herning Stadial) and that summer temperatures might have been similar to 6 degrees C lower than at present. Although this value should be treated with caution, as numerical analysis shows that it has a very poor fit-to-temperature, this low reconstructed value concurs with several other reconstructions that are available from western Europe. During MIS 5c (Brorup interstadial), the depositional environment changed into a lake system, initially with stratification of the water and subsequently with complete mixing and a strong influence of streams. Both chironomid-based and macroremain-based temperature inferences indicate past July air temperatures that were significantly higher than at present. This result is in contrast to other (low-resolution) reconstructions from northern Fennoscandia that indicate past temperatures 6-7 degrees C lower than present using fossil coleopteran assemblages. However, several central European sites indicate that there was a phase during the Brorup interstadial that was characterized by high summer temperatures, and a comparison between the high-resolution reconstructions from western Europe and the results presented in this study suggests that the north south July air temperature gradient between the mid- and high-latitudes was much weaker during the Brorup interstadial than it is at present. High solar insolation values (particularly the obliquity) during the Brorup interstadial might explain the low summer temperature gradient over the European continent. A return to fluvial conditions occurred in the upper parts of the sediment sequence, and, after a brief interval of gyttja deposition under cooling conditions, the site became glaciated during MIS 5b.

AGRONOMIE												Agricultural runoff from the Chablais region of France, is believed to contribute to the pollution of the waters of Lac Leman (Lake Geneva). This study aimed at determining which factors influence the frequency of runoff from agricultural lands. Two hundred agricultural fields under a wide diversity of agricultural practices were monitored during a winter and a summer period. For each field the kinetics of formation of superficial soil crusting that can prevent infiltration of rainfall into deeper soil layers was evaluated and the presence of runoff was observed. Additionally, the farmers were surveyed to determine the specific agricultural practices that were used on each field. The observations showed that both Hortonian and non-Hortonian runoff occurred. Sheet runoff was observed as well as runoff following tracks of cultivation equipment. The frequency of runoff varied among agricultural practices. Fields cultivated with non-rotative implements had a higher frequency of runoff than fields cultivated with rotative implements. Fields in long periods of rotation of corn or other crops without mulching showed high frequencies of runoff. A scale of runoff risk was developed to compare the frequency with which the different fanning systems in Chablais produced runoff. For each farming pratice this scale takes into account, at the field level, the kinetics of the development of impermeable soil crusting and the duration of the time the field is at risk to produce runoff. Fields on which the mechanization and rotational practices of traditional systems are used have the highest risk of producing runoff per unit area. Intensive farmiing systems have a lower risk of producing runoff per unit area. Intensive farming systems have a lower risk of producing runoff per unit area. However, because of the relatively small land area presently devoted to the traditional farming systems, both intensive and traditional systems contribute equally to the pollution of Lake Leman. As a result of this work, changes in traditional and intensive practices are suggested that are believed to enhance agricultural sustainability on the French shores of Lake Leman and reduce environmental impacts.																			0249-5627						1997	17	2					65	82		10.1051/agro:19970201	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/agro:19970201													WOS:A1997WY70300001

Impacts of Historical Atmospheric and Oceanic Warming on Heavy Snowfall in December 2020 in Japan	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Strong cold air outbreaks caused heavy snowfall over the inland areas of the Sea of Japan coast of Japan in mid-December 2020. The 48-hr accumulated snowfall during the term broke a snowfall record at some observational stations of the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). We investigated the impacts of atmospheric and oceanic temperature changes due to historical global warming since the pre-industrial period on this heavy snowfall event. Hindcast and pseudo non-warming experiments were conducted using the nonhydrostatic model developed by the JMA. The historical climatic differences were obtained from the database for policy decision-making for future climate change (d4PDF). Our experiments indicated that historical global warming enhanced precipitation over the whole region and enhanced heavy snowfall over the inland areas on the Sea of Japan side. In this event, the contribution of conversion from snowfall to rainfall due to warming was limited over coastal areas. The enhancement of precipitation was mainly caused by oceanic warming, which increased latent heat flux over the Sea of Japan and made the low-level atmosphere less stable. Historical atmospheric warming suppressed precipitation due to atmospheric stabilization. Our results indicated that the heavy snowfall was caused by the cold air outbreaks under the warm sea surface temperatures in December and enhanced by historical global warming.					; Imada, Yukiko/OKT-1965-2025	Watanabe, Shun-ichi/0000-0003-4456-3932; Kawase, Hiroaki/0000-0003-4865-791X; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				NOV 16	2022	127	21							e2022JD036996	10.1029/2022JD036996	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JD036996													WOS:000879813200001

This variability poses a significant challenge in developing long-term POC concentration records from multi-satellite observations, particularly when bridging historical and modern sensors in optically complex waters. The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) perform well in retrieving the bio-optical parameters related to POC in global inland waters. In this study, we utilize data from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), which has similar spectral bands, as a connection to validate the consistency of the atmospherically corrected remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda)) of MERIS and OLCI using field measurements. An inter-sensor validation of R-rs(lambda) has also been conducted based on the match-up pairs of satellite data. A blended POC model suitable for both non-algal particles (NAP)-dominated (Type 1) and phytoplankton-dominated (Type 2) waters has been proposed and developed using the multi-sensor R-rs(lambda) data. POC concentrations of 110 lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and Huai River (MLYHR) basin in China are retrieved based on multi-sensor R-rs(lambda) data from 2003 to 2023. The results demonstrate that: 1) the R-rs(lambda) of MERIS, GOCI, and OLCI show good consistency from the green to near-infrared (NIR) bands, 2) the proposed POC inversion model has been validated using field-measured POC with good performance (root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.49 mg/L for Type 1 and 4.52 mg/L for Type 2), and 3) significant seasonal variations in POC in the region have been observed, with high values in summer and low values in winter. Small lakes with areas of similar to 10-50 km(2) have higher mean POC values (7.63 +/- 0.69 mg/L) than those in large lakes (e.g., in lakes ranging from 100 to 500 km(2), the POC concentration is 5.91 +/- 0.81 mg/L). The multi-sensor strategy for estimating POC in optically complex waters provides a practical way to fully utilize the spectral bands and long-term observations from multiple satellites.

A rare Uroglena bloom in Beaver Lake, Arkansas, spring 2015. Lake Reserve Manage. 33:8-13.A combination of factors triggered a Uroglena volvox bloom and taste and odor event in Beaver Lake, a water-supply reservoir in northwest Arkansas, in late April 2015. Factors contributing to the bloom included increased rainfall and runoff containing increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, followed by a stable pool, low nutrient concentrations, and an expansion of lake surface area and littoral zone. This was the first time U. volvox was identified in Beaver Lake and the first time it was recognized as a source of taste and odor. Routine water quality samples happened to be collected by the US Geological Survey and the Beaver Water District throughout the reservoir during the bloom. Higher than normal rainfall in March 2015 increased the pool elevation in Beaver Lake by 2.3m (by early April), increased the surface area by 10%, and increased the littoral zone by 1214 ha; these conditions persisted for 38days, resulting from flood water being retained behind the dam. Monitoring programs that cover a wide range of reservoir features, including dissolved organic carbon, zooplankton, and phytoplankton, are valuable in explaining unusual events such as this Uroglena bloom.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				MAR	2017	33	1					8	13		10.1080/10402381.2016.1238427	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2016.1238427													WOS:000396042900002
J	Livingstone, DM; Imboden, DM				Livingstone, DM; Imboden, DM			The prediction of hypolimnetic oxygen profiles: A plea for a deductive approach	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												A simple deductive model, based on a general one-dimensional topographic vertical model, provides much insight into the behaviour of oxygen profiles in lake hypolimnia. The thickness of the anoxic layer is predicted to be directly proportional to the areal oxygen sink (sediment oxygen consumption) and inversely proportional to the difference between the oxygen concentration at the end of spring turnover and the reduction in oxygen concentration owing to the volume sink (water column oxygen consumption). Results from the model suggest that in highly eutrophic lakes, a small reduction in the oxygen concentration at the end of spring turnover could suffice to bring about a sudden, catastrophic expansion of the anoxic zone. In such lakes one must therefore be careful not to confuse effects of natural interannual meteorological variation or secular climate change with those of anthropogenic eutrophication or oligotrophication. A plea is made for a shift of approach away from the development of a multiplicity of inductive models, each with a limited range of applicability, for the prediction of hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations, toward the development of process-orientated, deductive models of more general applicability, especially in view of future problems in lake management likely to arise in the wake of climate change.																			0706-652X					APR	1996	53	4					924	932		10.1139/cjfas-53-4-924	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-53-4-924													WOS:A1996VD06300025

WESTERN EXPLORERS AND VOLCANIC HEAT IN HAWAI'I	EARTH SCIENCES HISTORY												This paper is the first to compile the accounts of Western explorers to Hawai'i who used volcanic heat. During the 1800s, Western explorers used volcanic heat when climbing and surveying Kilauea and Mauna Loa volcanoes in Hawai'i. The explorers cooked food on steam vents and lava streams. They drank condensed water from volcanic steam and bathed in a warm basin and warm springs. They warmed themselves near steam cracks and a lava stream, lit cigarettes with Kilauea's lava lake, and collected rocks. To confirm the presence of volcanic heat, this study uses geothermal resource maps and data from the Hawai'i Play Fairway project. The areas where the explorers used volcanic heat have a probability of volcanic heat of 0.7 to 1.0, and elevated temperatures in nearby water wells indicate heat sources. Kilauea and Mauna Loa erupted numerous times, and the surrounding areas experienced volcanic steam releases and lava flows. The explorers used volcanic heat to facilitate not only their survival but also the Western exploration and scientific investigation of Kilauea and Mauna Loa volcanoes.																			0736-623X	1944-6187					2021	40	2					607	624		10.17704/1944-6187-40.2.607	http://dx.doi.org/10.17704/1944-6187-40.2.607													WOS:001008825900010

Two annual shell length (SL) cohorts were present at all four sites consisting of individuals presumed to have settled during spring-fall of 2005 and 2006, respectively. Members of the most recently settled 2006 cohort numerically dominated all samples; relative ratios of individuals in the LVBH, CBM-2, LMM, and KLM 2006 versus 2005 cohorts being 174:1, 95:1, 172:1 and 65:1, respectively. Mean shell lengths of the LVBH, CBM-1, CBM-2, KLM and LMM 2006 cohorts were 6.86 (s.c. = +/- 0.126), 9.59 (+/- 0.080), 9.31 (+/- 0.194), 10.49 (+/- 0.287) and 12.15 mm (+/- 0.105), respectively. The mean shell lengths of the 2005 cohorts in the LVBH, CBM-2, KLM and LMM samples were 17.5 mm (n = 1), 18.9 mm (n = 4), 21.2 mm (n = I) and 20.1 mm (n = 4), respectively. The occurrence of the 2005 cohort in all four sampled sites suggested that quagga mussel introduction to the Boulder Basin occurred prior to 2005. This supposition is based on the very low probability of individuals from a localized initial introduction appearing in the samples. It is hypothesized that a reproducing quagga mussel population must have been established somewhere in the Boulder Basin by 2003 or 2004 in order to generate enough veliger larvae to settle as relatively wide-spread members of the 2005 cohort and be transported downstream to establish a 2005 cohort at KLM in lower Lake Mohave. Essentially equivalent population structures at all three sampled sites makes speculation on the original site of quagga mussel introduction to the Boulder Basin difficult.																			1798-6540	1818-5487				JUN	2011	6	2			SI		131	140		10.3391/ai.2011.6.2.02	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/ai.2011.6.2.02													WOS:000291958100002

Arctic Char (Salvelinus alpinus) is an anadromous salmonid and the most harvested fish species by Inuit people, including in Nunavik (Quebec, Canada), one of the most recently deglaciated regions in the world. Unlike many other anadromous salmonids, Arctic Char occupy coastal habitats near their natal rivers during their short marine phase restricted to the summer ice-free period. Our main objective was to document putatively neutral and adaptive genomic variation in anadromous Arctic Char populations from Nunavik and bordering regions to inform local fisheries management. We used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to genotype 18,112 filtered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 650 individuals from 23 sampling locations along >2000 km of coastline. Our results reveal a hierarchical genetic structure, whereby neighboring hydrographic systems harbor distinct populations grouped by major oceanographic basins: Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Ungava Bay, and Labrador Sea. We found genetic diversity and differentiation to be consistent both with the expected postglacial recolonization history and with patterns of isolation-by-distance reflecting contemporary gene flow. Results from three gene-environment association methods supported the hypothesis of local adaptation to both freshwater and marine environments (strongest associations with sea surface and air temperatures during summer and salinity). Our results support a fisheries management strategy at a regional scale, and other implications for hatchery projects and adaptation to climate change are discussed.					; Dallaire, Xavier/ABA-2785-2022	Tremblay, Jean-Eric/0000-0003-0319-5723; Normandeau, Eric/0000-0003-2841-9391; Dallaire, Xavier/0000-0003-2375-561X; Mainguy, Julien/0000-0001-9532-5550; Bernatchez, Louis/0000-0002-8085-9709; Moore, Jean-Sebastien/0000-0002-3353-3730													1752-4571					JUL	2021	14	7					1880	1897		10.1111/eva.13248	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eva.13248		MAY 2021						34295370					WOS:000655115500001
J	DUNBAR, MJ				DUNBAR, MJ			THE LIFE CYCLE OF SAGITTA ELEGANS IN ARCTIC AND SUBARCTIC SEAS, AND THE MODIFYING EFFECTS OF HYDROGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES IN THE ENVIRONMENT	JOURNAL OF MARINE RESEARCH												Sagitta elegans arctica of the Canadian eastern Arctic waters has a life span of two years. Its breeding cycle is two-phase, or alternating, and the population consists of two distinct groups breeding in different years. The spawning period is long, extending from July into the winter, probably up to February. Winter spawning is taken to imply that the breeding behaviour is not timed to coincide with the maximum abundance of food, but that the cycle is determined by the growth limitations imposed by the low temperature. Hydrographic differences between Hudson Bay, Foxe Channel, Ungave Bay and Frobisher Bay, though not great, are reflected in the biology of Sagitta. Strong tidal turbulence in Ungava Bay and Frobisher Bay appears to remove the young-of-the-year from these two areas quickly, or to cause such vertical mixing that they are not properly sampled. The very special conditions in Lake Ogac produce rapid growth, small size and a single-phase or nonaltenating breeding cycle.

August 2008 Eruption of Kasatochi Volcano, Aleutian Islands, Alaska-Resetting an Island Landscape	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Kasatochi Island, the subaerial portion of a small volcano in the western Aleutian volcanic arc, erupted on 7-8 August 2008. Pyroclastic flows and surges swept the island repeatedly and buried most of it and the near-shore zone in decimeters to tens of meters of deposits. Several key seabird rookeries in taluses were rendered useless. The eruption lasted for about 24 hours and included two initial explosive pulses and pauses over a 6-hr period that produced ash-poor eruption clouds, a 10-hr period of continuous ash-rich emissions initiated by an explosive pulse and punctuated by two others, and a final 8-hr period of waning ash emissions. The deposits of the eruption include a basal muddy tephra that probably reflects initial eruptions through the shallow crater lake, a sequence of pumiceous and lithic-rich pyroclastic deposits produced by flow, surge, and fall processes during a period of energetic explosive eruption, and a fine-grained upper mantle of pyroclastic-fall and -surge deposits that probably reflects the waning eruptive stage as lake and ground water again gained access to the erupting magma. An eruption with similar impact on the island's environment had not occurred for at least several centuries. Since the 2008 eruption, the volcano has remained quiet other than emission of volcanic gases. Erosion and deposition are rapidly altering slopes and beaches.																			1523-0430	1938-4246				AUG	2010	42	3					250	259		10.1657/1938-4246-42.3.250	http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1938-4246-42.3.250													WOS:000281921300002

Enumeration of total virioplankton and isolation of specific cyanophages from selected aquatic ecosystems in Goa, India	CURRENT SCIENCE												Viruses are known to be highly abundant and, therefore, ecologically significant entities of all aquatic ecosystems. However, very few studies from marine and freshwater ecosystems in India have dealt with enumeration, isolation or characterization of their virus (virioplankton) populations. In the present study, we have estimated total virioplankton populations from several kinds of aquatic niches, viz. rice fields, lakes and estuaries, using flow cytometry. Rice field floodwaters displayed the highest virioplankton count of 1.21 x 10(7) particles per ml. As cyanophages form the second most abundant class of virioplankton (after bacteriophages), we also isolated four cyanophages from the same aquatic niches.					; Gauns, Mangesh/AAT-9684-2021	Noronha, Judith/0000-0003-3376-6013; Gauns, Mangesh/0000-0002-4737-9252; GHADI, SANJEEV/0000-0002-0007-390X													0011-3891					DEC 10	2018	115	11					2147	2150		10.18520/cs/v115/i11/2147-2150	http://dx.doi.org/10.18520/cs/v115/i11/2147-2150													WOS:000452542300032
J	Borisova, O				Borisova, Olga			Environmental and climatic conditions of human occupation in the central East European Plain during the Middle Holocene: Reconstruction from palaeofloristic data	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Paleobotanical assemblages from peat, lake, and archaeological deposits reveal that during the Middle Holocene (MH; ca. 9.0 to 4.7 kyr BP), the central East European Plain was occupied by highly productive and diverse mixed-oak forests, along with mire, meadow, and riverine communities. Climatic reconstructions based on modern analogues of fossil pollen and plant macrofossil assemblages indicate that throughout the MH mean annual precipitation was at near-present levels (similar to 600 mm) and July temperatures were similar to those of today (similar to 17 degrees C). However, differences in the Fossil Floras (FFs) suggest changes in winter conditions though the MH, with January temperatures higher than the present-day value of -10 degrees C by 2 degrees C in the Early Atlantic (FF1), 6 degrees C in the Middle Atlantic (FF2), and 3 degrees C in the Late Atlantic-Early Subboreal (FF3). The annual frost-free period was 15 days longer than today in the Early Atlantic, about one month longer in the Late Atlantic, and became close to present by the beginning of the Subboreal. The combination of warm winters with diverse and productive vegetation communities provided an environment that was more hospitable than that of today for Late Mesolithic and Neolithic societies.

In these areas, Asian clams are typically found in thermal refugia like warmwater discharges from industrial facilities. We sought to identify the current extent of Asian clam populations in Lake Michigan and waters immediately adjacent to it, specifically at locations most likely to harbor overwintering populations - industrial warmwater discharges. During April-May 2017, we surveyed 17 locations around Lake Michigan. Evidence of Asian clam populations was found at four sites, though live specimens (n = 3) were only found at the Indiana Harbor Ship Canal in East Chicago, IN. Shells or fragments of shells were found at Green Bay, WI, Waukegan, IL, and Port Sheldon, MI. Our findings indicate that although Asian clams are present in Lake Michigan, they are relatively rare, and remain isolated to a few small pockets of over-wintering habitat.

Evaluation of the human health threat associated with the hepatotoxin microcystin in the muscle and liver tissues of yellow perch (Perca flavescens)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												During the summer of 2006, the western basin of Lake Erie experienced a bloom of the toxigenic cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa. Across 11 sites, intracellular, particulate-bound microcystin levels in the seston increased to levels that exceeded World Health Organization guidelines for drinking water exposure (1 mu g toxin-L-1). In contrast, toxin concentrations in yellow perch (Perca flavescens) muscle tissue (n = 68) declined from June to August, were negatively related to algal toxin levels, and never exceeded a conservative chronic exposure concentration estimated using proposed United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) guidelines. Microcystin concentrations in yellow perch liver exceeded US EPA chronic exposure guidelines, were on average 125 times higher than muscle toxin concentrations per unit dry weight, and varied little throughout the summer. With current guidelines, humans do not appear to be at risk when consuming the muscle tissue of Lake Erie yellow perch collected during large-scale cyanobacterial blooms. However, this study highlights the need for a better understanding of the trophic transfer of cyanobacterial toxins through aquatic food webs in diverse ecosystems with an emphasis on understanding if these compounds could accumulate sufficiently to affect human health.

Andean drought and glacial retreat tied to Greenland warming during the last glacial period	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Abrupt warming events recorded in Greenland ice cores known as Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) interstadials are linked to changes in tropical circulation during the last glacial cycle. Corresponding variations in South American summer monsoon (SASM) strength are documented, most commonly, in isotopic records from speleothems, but less is known about how these changes affected precipitation and Andean glacier mass balance. Here we present a sediment record spanning the last similar to 50 ka from Lake Junin (Peru) in the tropical Andes that has sufficient chronologic precision to document abrupt climatic events on a centennial-millennial time scale. DO events involved the near-complete disappearance of glaciers below 4700 masl in the eastern Andean cordillera and major reductions in the level of Peru's second largest lake. Our results reveal the magnitude of the hydroclimatic disruptions in the highest reaches of the Amazon Basin that were caused by a weakening of the SASM during abrupt arctic warming. Accentuated warming in the Arctic could lead to significant reductions in the precipitation-evaporation balance of the southern tropical Andes with deleterious effects on this densely populated region of South America. How the abrupt warming events recorded in Greenland ice cores during the last glacial cycle have influenced the tropical climate is not well known. Here the authors present new lake sediment data from the Peruvian Andes that shows that these events resulted in rapid glacier retreat and large reductions in lake level.

The residual levels of OCPs in the water and gas phase were monitored in Lake Chaohu, a large Chinese lake, from March 2010 to February 2011. Nineteen types of OCPs were detected in the water with a total concentration of 7.27 +/- 3.32 ng/l. Aldrin, DDTs and HCHs were the major OCPs in the water, accounting for 38.3 %, 28.9 % and 23.6 % of the total, respectively. The highest mean concentration (12.32 ng/l) in the water was found in September, while the lowest (1.74 ng/l) was found in November. Twenty types of gaseous OCPs were detected in the atmosphere with a total concentration of 542.0 +/- 636.5 pg/m(3). Endosulfan, DDTs and chlordane were the major gaseous OCPs in the atmosphere, accounting for 48.9 %, 22.5 % and 14.4 % of the total, respectively. The mean concentration of gaseous OCPs was significantly higher in summer than in winter. o,p'-DDE was the main metabolite of DDT in both the water and gas phase. Of the HCHs, 52.3 % existed as beta-HCH in the water, while alpha-HCH (37.9 %) and gamma-HCH (30.9 %) were dominant isomers in the gas phase. The average fluxes were -21.11, -3.30, -152.41, -35.50 and -1314.15 ng/(m(2) day) for alpha-HCH, gamma-HCH, HCB, DDT and DDE, respectively. The water-gas exchanges of the five types of OCPs indicate that water was the main potential source of gaseous OCPs in the atmosphere. A sensitivity analysis indicated that the water-gas flux of alpha-HCH, gamma-HCH and DDT is more vulnerable than that of HCB and DDE to the variation of the parameters. The possible source of the HCHs in the water was from the historical usage of lindane; however, that in the air was mainly from the recent usage of lindane. The technical DDT and dicofol might be the source of DDTs in the water and air.

Late summer hyperbenthic estuarine communities: comparing permanently open and intermittently closed systems along the Otago coastline	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Few studies have compared hyperbenthic communities among estuaries, in either New Zealand or elsewhere. This study presents the results of a single late summer survey of the lower reaches of 26 estuarine systems along the Otago coastline from the Clutha River to Oamaru, comparing hyperbenthic communities among both permanently open and intermittently closed estuaries. Intermittently closed estuaries are periodically closed from the ocean because of the formation of a berm across the mouth. A total of 33 taxa were captured with mysids and amphipods, the most widespread hyperbenthic taxa, being common in both permanently open and intermittently closed Otago estuaries. The mysid, Tenagomysis novae-zealandiae, and amphipod, Paracalliope fluviatilis, were widespread, found in 74% and 68% of all estuaries sampled, respectively. In contrast, most other taxa were present in relatively few estuaries, with 17 species recorded from only 10% of estuaries. There was a significant difference in the community composition among permanently open and intermittently closed estuaries. The results highlight the potential sensitivity of New Zealand estuarine communities to management regimes that may alter their open/closed status.

Lake Winnebago serves as the source water which experiences algae blooms that are typically accompanied by severe taste and odor (T&O) episodes. Historically, raw water quality in the summer months prevents the full capacity from being achieved despite the use of potassium permanganate, powdered activated carbon (PAC) and granular activated carbon (GAC) filters. Thus, me City proceeded with a study of various treatment processes to mitigate the T&O problems experienced during the summer months. The relatively short duration of T&O episodes and extensive experimental plan necessitated a bench-scale testing for rapid evaluation of various oxidation and adsorptive processes. This paper presents a review of the effect of carbon type, dosage, contact time, and application point on the performance of PAC in controlling odors. In addition the effect of GAC type and empty bed contact time (EBCT) on removal of T&O compounds were evaluated using a rapid small scale column test (RSSCT).

J	Zhang, W; Dong, X; Liu, ZX; Lin, RP; Luo, H				Zhang, Wen; Dong, Xiao; Liu, Zhenxin; Lin, Renping; Luo, Hao			Influence of Decadal Ocean Signals on Meteorological Conditions Associated With the Winter Haze Over Eastern China	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												The possible influence of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) and the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) on the meteorological conditions associated with haze over central eastern China at decadal time scale was investigated using reanalysis and observational dataset for 1979-2018. Four indices, including Siberian high (SH) strength and position indices (SHI/SHPI), a normalized near-surface wind-speed index (WSI) and a potential air temperature gradient index (ATGI), are adopted to denote the meteorological conditions associated with haze. Results shown that the AMO and PDO are both highly correlated with the fluctuation of meteorological factors associated with haze on decadal scale. Although AMO and PDO were in opposite phases during the whole period, since 1997, they both changed phases (AMO shifted to a positive phase and PDO changed to negative) and became favorable for an anomalous dipole-type SLP pattern in the middle-high latitudes of East Asia. The AMO has played a leading role in decadal variation of the large-scale circulation system, while the PDO has had a closer relationship with the lower ventilation condition in eastern China. On the decadal time scale, the AMO stimulates a zonal teleconnection wave train (the AMO northern Hemisphere pattern, ANH) that originates from the North Atlantic Ocean and passes through central Europe, the northern Ural Mountains, Lake Balkhash-Baikal, and central eastern China. During the positive phase of AMO, the ANH induces a stronger and westward shifted SH, with the central eastern China controlled by the anomalous high pressure. In addition, affected by the cyclone (anticyclone) anomaly over Hetao region and North China (the Sea of Japan), southerly wind anomalies dominate over central eastern China. Compared with the AMO, the wave train generated by the negative (positive) PDO phase mainly propagates in the Pacific region, and there is a strong anticyclonic (cyclonic) anomaly over the Northeast Pacific, guiding the air flow southward (northward) along the East Asian coast and thus suppressing (encouraging) the dispersion of pollutants and resulting in above (below)-normal haze episodes.

These freshwater systems represent important habitats accommodating diverse microbial communities. Here, 27 lakes in northern Germany, Poland and Finland were surveyed for the presence of aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic (AAP) bacteria during the summer seasons of 2008 and 2009. Using infrared epifluorescence microscopy, AAP bacteria were found to represent from 2 to 12% of total bacteria in surface layers of the studied lakes. The AAP abundance was correlated with total bacterial numbers, total phosphorus and chlorophyll concentration. The size fractionation analyses indicated that a significant portion of AAP cells was attached to particles. Our findings suggest that AAP bacteria represent a significant component of the microbial community in the studied lakes.

A new approach is developed to estimate aerosol scattering reflectance from satellite data based on a look-up table of in situ water-leaving reflectance. A decision rule is set to determine the water-leaving component of the total satellite-measured radiance from the table under an assumption that aerosol scattering reflectance follows the Angstrom law. The epsilon spectrum, obtained from the ratio of aerosol scattering reflectance, is used to select the two closest aerosol models for determining the corrected epsilon values, which is adjusted to new values according to the reference wavelength. The actual aerosol scattering reflectance is obtained from the mean value of the reflectance and the new epsilon spectrum. The performance of the model is evaluated using the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) imagery, showing that the component of aerosol scattering reflectance can be completely separated from the total satellite-measured radiance, and effects of non-zero water-leaving reflectance can be eliminated over highly turbid waters. The accuracy is validated by in situ measured aerosol optical thickness (AOT) using a handheld multi-band sun photometer and the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measured AOT data during the 2006 winter cruise and 2007 autumn cruise over the East China Sea (ECS). The analysis gives the mean relative errors of 23.73% and 32.04%, respectively. Our analysis shows that aerosol scattering reflectance can be significantly overestimated over turbid waters when using the atmospheric correction method based on the black ocean assumption (BOA). It may also have some errors over oceanic waters because a small 1% bias of satellite-measured reflectance in the near-infrared (NIR) bands will lead to a relatively large error of similar to 10% in aerosol scattering reflectance in Band 1. This error will spread to water-leaving reflectance, possibly leading to negative values of water-leaving reflectance. This amplifying effect of aerosol scattering reflectance can be limited by matching aerosol models using epsilon spectrum in our model. Because the assumption of aerosol scattering reflectance following the Angstrom law can eliminate effects of different types of waters including open ocean, coastal regions, lakes and rivers, our model offers a potentially universal algorithm for estimating aerosol scattering reflectance from satellite remote sensing data.

We examined the effect of zebra mussel colonisation on invertebrate communities inhabiting soft sediments in two bays along the Vermont shoreline of Lake Champlain, U.S.A. 2. In summer 2001, we conducted manipulative experiments (addition and removal of zebra mussel colonies) with respective controls to assess the effect of colonies on invertebrate abundance, richness, and position within sediments (within colony versus underlying colony) and compared these data to comparative studies of natural communities in summer 2002. 3. Split core samples were taken two months after the manipulation and the following year so that we could quantify individuals and species inhabiting zebra mussel colonies separately from those in sediments underlying zebra mussel colonies and adjacent sediments lacking zebra mussels. 4. Zebra mussel-covered sediments supported more abundant and richer invertebrate communities than adjacent sediments lacking zebra mussels. 5. Abundance and richness patterns in zebra mussel-addition and removal treatments closely paralleled those in natural communities. 6. Despite severe oxygen depletion at the interface of underlying sediments and overlying zebra mussel colonies, most infaunal invertebrates responded positively to zebra mussel colonisation either by remaining in sediments underlying zebra mussel colonies or by migrating into zebra mussel colonies.

J	SARNELLE, O				SARNELLE, O			HERBIVORE EFFECTS ON PHYTOPLANKTON SUCCESSION IN A EUTROPHIC LAKE	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Herbivory can potentially affect the speed and direction of plant succession by favoring the development of a community dominated by grazing-resistant species. This idea was tested experimentally by examining the effects of the planktonic herbivore, Daphnia, on phytoplankton succession in a naturally eutrophic lake. Phytoplankton succession was characterized by two major transitions in community structure. Algal dominance shifted from small diatoms and chlorophytes during the spring bloom to cryptophyte flagellates during the clear-water phase. After the clear-water phase, dominance shifted to filamentous blue-greens (cyanobacteria). Algal species positions in the successional sequence were repeatable from year to year, despite interannual shifts in the timing of species' peak abundances associated with a drastic change in the food web. In addition, evidence is presented to suggest that Daphnia-induced changes in water clarity may have fostered increases in epilimnetic mixing, which, in turn, may have stimulated brief blooms of large-celled algae after clear-water periods. Daphnia manipulation in large enclosures, and whole-lake observations before and after a fish kill, showed that intense grazing promoted the transition from edible, spring-bloom species to similarly edible, cryptophyte flagellates. In contrast, Daphnia grazing retarded further succession to grazing-resistant, filamentous blue-greens. Thus, the effects of herbivory on algal succession were not predictable from the relative susceptibilities of these algal species to grazing mortality. These results underscore the importance of indirect effects in the herbivore-plant interactions of planktonic communities. The observation that a single species of herbivore had opposite effects during two successional transitions implies that caution should be exercised when extrapolating grazer effects beyond the time scale of an experiment.																			0012-9615					MAY	1993	63	2					129	149		10.2307/2937177	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2937177													WOS:A1993MN18700002

The present study investigated the phytoplankton interactions with the dissolved N forms, nitrate (NO3) and ammonium (NH4) in a sub-tropical Yangtze River tributary, China vulnerable to multiple anthropogenic stressors following the impoundment of the largest hydraulic structure, the Three Gorges Dam. Results indicated strong NO3 inhibition by the low NH4 pool exerting toxic effects on the major phytoplankton groups, particularly the Bacilliariophyta (relative abundance < 1%) while significant Cyanophyta proliferation prevailed (relative abundance >= 90%). Strong N limitation exacerbated by NH4 deficit and P replete condition characterizes the summer bloom in the tributary. The biomass attenuation kinetics revealed significantly fast NH4 metabolism, half-life (t(1/2) = 1.4 d, K = 0.00750 +/- 0.004 d(-1)) as the first-order rate adequately fitted into the experimental data although, the second-order rate also demonstrated considerable goodness of fit. The growth responses induced by the Si enrichment potentially suggested possible secondary limitation by Si with the likelihood of intensification should the ecosystem phytoplankton community dominance shifts from Cyanophyta to the Bacilliariophyta. The response of P enrichment on growth was attributed to luxury consumption rather than limitation as responses only became significant towards the end of the study. The study, therefore, presents the first report of biomass ageing rate worthy of incorporation into the recent bloom management protocol for the development of predictive ecosystem dynamics.					; Nwankwegu, Amechi/AAT-8365-2020; Norgbey, Eyram/Q-7857-2019; Paerl, Hans/ACA-9911-2022; Nwankwegu, Amechi S./AAT-8365-2020	Norgbey (PhD), Eyram/0000-0002-1020-2533; Nwankwegu, Amechi S./0000-0003-3561-0514													0301-4797	1095-8630				OCT 1	2020	271								110971	10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110971	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110971								32579524					WOS:000558812000039
J	Adams, KD; Rhodes, EJ				Adams, Kenneth D.; Rhodes, Edward J.			Late Pleistocene to present lake-level fluctuations at Pyramid and Winnemucca lakes, Nevada, USA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												A new lake-level curve for Pyramid and Winnemucca lakes, Nevada, is presented that indicates that after the similar to 15,500 cal yr BP Lake Lahontan high stand (1338 m), lake level fell to an elevation below 1200 m, before rising to 1230 m at the 12,000 cal yr BP Younger Dryas high stand. Lake level then fell to 1155 m by similar to 10,500 cal yr BP followed by a rise to 1200 m around 8000 cal yr BP. During the mid-Holocene, levels were relatively low (similar to 1155 m) before rising to moderate levels (1190-1195 m) during the Neopluvial period (similar to 4800-3400 cal yr BP). Lake level again plunged to about 1155 m during the late Holocene dry period (similar to 2800-1900 cal yr BP) before rising to about 1190 m by similar to 1200 cal yr BP. Levels have since fluctuated within the elevation range of about 1170-1182 m except for the last 100 yr of managed river discharge when they dropped to as low as 1153 m. Late Holocene lake-level changes correspond to volume changes between 25 and 55 km(3) and surface area changes between 450 and 900 km(2). These lake state changes probably encompass the hydrologic variability possible under current climate boundary conditions.																			0033-5894	1096-0287				JUL	2019	92	1					146	164		10.1017/qua.2018.134	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/qua.2018.134													WOS:000476591500010

The method was tested on waters from Lake Kinneret (The Sea of Galilee) and saline springs that flow into it. The radium is pre-concentrated from 60 L of Lake Kinneret water (or 2 L of the saline springs water) by co-precipitation with MnO2. The separation of radium from the matrix elements was conducted by BioRad (R) AG50W-X8 and Sr Spec (R) resins. The instrumental limit of detection for Ra-228 and Ra-228 was 5 fg mL(-1) (0.05 ppq) or 0.1 and 30 dpm L-1, respectively, and the absolute limit of detection 0.005 fg. Internal precision of the radium isotope ratio (Ra-228/Ra-226) in Lake Kinneret for Ra-228 concentration as low as 0.10 fg L-1 (0.06 dpm L-1) was 2.8% (2 sigma) and external precision was 10% (2 sigma, n = 9).

Tommy			Morphometric Variation during Chick Development in Interior Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus)	WATERBIRDS												In numerous avian species, egg size is correlated to female body condition, hatchling size and nestling growth. Recent demography studies of Interior Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) suggest a migratory divide across the Great Lakes; western populations winter in the Gulf of Mexico region of the southeastern United States (Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi) with extensive catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) aqua culture, and eastern populations winter in Florida, where catfish aquaculture is not pervasive. If Double-crested Cormorants have improved their overall body condition through catfish exploitation, then egg and chick sizes should also be affected. Three breeding areas in Ontario (east, central, and west) were selected for empirical measures of size variation. During the breeding seasons of 2006 and 2007, egg, naked young, fledgling, and adult morphometric data were collected. Eggs in eastern areas (volume = 465.8 +/- 3.9 cm(3)) were on average larger than eggs in central (volume = 458.1 +/- 3.5 cm(3)) and western (volume = 451.7 +/- 3.5 cm(3)) areas. However, chicks in eastern areas (culmen = 54.9 +/- 0.6 mm) were smaller than chicks in central (culmen = 57.6 +/- 0.4 mm) and western (culmen = 59.3 +/- 0.3 mm) areas, not only at hatching, but throughout development and fledging. A comprehensive Double -crested Cormorant morphometric gradient that may suggest a potential reproductive advantage for birds exploiting aquaculture facilities is presented.

Influence of mechanical layering and natural fractures on undercutting and rapid headward erosion (recession) at Canyon Lake spillway, Texas, USA	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY												This study investigates the role of mechanical layering and fractures on flood-related erosional undercutting and resulting rapid spillway recession. In the summer of 2002, 86 cm of rain fell in an 8-day period across the Guadalupe River drainage basin in central Texas, causing Canyon Lake reservoir to completely fill and overtop the emergency spillway for the first time. The resulting flood incised a gorge into the mechanically layered Glen Rose Formation and caused headward erosion (recession) at the downstream edge of the emergency spillway. Comparison of pre- and post-flood imagery and assessment of flood records indicates that maximum recession localized at the northern end of the emergency spillway where 28 m recession occurred. This recession occurred at an estimated rate of up to 10 m/day during the first similar to 3 days of the flood, which is among the highest rates of recorded bedrock recession. Analysis of historical photographs, field observations and measurement of erosional undercutting, along with measurements of fracture orientation, fracture spacing, and mechanical rebound are used to understand rock mass characteristics that influenced erosional undercutting and rapid recession of the spillway. Evidence of significant undercutting was observed where incompetent argillaceous wackestone (marl) underlies competent limestone. These results reveal that the greatest amount and rate of recession of the spillway was associated with undercutting and toppling collapse of fracture-bounded limestone blocks. Block size may be a factor in continuation of the process, in that large blocks may accumulate at the base of the scarp and inhibit continued erosional undercutting, whereas in other areas smaller eroded blocks can be carried away by the floodwaters and undercutting may continue, facilitating recession. The combination of mechanical contrast between layers and natural fractures in competent layers together contributed to exceptionally high rates of headward erosion. Observed rock mass erodibility behavior was in the range of medium to high erodibility in limestone with widely spaced fractures that would normally be expected to have very low erodibility. Bulk rock mass erodibility in this situation was similar to the most erodibile layer, specifically, the marl at base of spillway pour-off cliff.																			0013-7952	1872-6917				JAN	2021	280								105897	10.1016/j.enggeo.2020.105897	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2020.105897													WOS:000615526300004
J	Sosnovsky, A; Quirós, R				Sosnovsky, Alejandro; Quiros, Rolando			Effects of fish manipulation on the plankton community in small hypertrophic lakes from the Pampa Plain (Argentina)	LIMNOLOGICA												Trophic cascade hypotheses predict that fish will affect the structure and biomass of pelagic plankton communities. In order to investigate trophic cascade effects from fish down to phytoplankton, whole-lake studies were performed in five hypertrophic (mean total phosphorus (TP) concentrations higher than 1000 mg m(-3)) shallow lakes located in the Pampa Plain. The main climatic characteristic of this region is the alternation between periods of drought and flood, with corresponding changes of lake depth and conductivity of lake water. All lakes were studied from April to December 2000. Samples were taken of their physical and chemical characteristics and biotic communities, focusing on the zooplankton community. Fish were manipulated in four lakes (Capurro, Longinotti, Vedia 1, Vedia 2), while the fifth (Lake Vedia 3) was left undisturbed as a reference system. High abundance of planktivorous minnows (Jenynsia multidentata and Cheirodon interruptus) dominated the fish community in the reference lake. In the manipulated lakes, fish stocks were largely reduced in late autumn (May). During winter, Capurro, Longinotti and Vedia I were stocked with a visual planktivore, the pampean silverside (Odontesthes bonariensis, Atherinidae). Fish stocking was 24, 33 and 19 kg ha(-1), respectively. In contrast, no fish were stocked in Lake Vedia 2. Following fish removal, large Daphnia appeared in these lakes and grazed intensively on the phytoplankton. In contrast, no Daphnia were found in the reference lake (Vedia 3). The stocking of O. bonariensis in lakes Capurro, Longinotti and Vedia I led to a decrease in the percentage of large cladocerans and a rise in the phytoplankton biomass:TP ratio. Moreover, the lakes mentioned were stocked with different quantities of silversides over different periods of time. These differences were reflected temporarily in the plankton dynamics, affecting mainly larger sized zooplankton. Nevertheless, the presence of Daphnia was short lived in the lake where fish had been removed and no O. bonariensis were stocked. Competition for resources and recruitment of remaining fish probably caused a collapse in the zooplankton biomass. Our results support the idea that fish predation on zooplankton and its effect on phytoplankton is very intense in small pampean lakes. Fish removal was short lived, however. This could be because in small pampean lakes fish recolonization is favored, and minnows are highly prolific. Moreover, if manipulation of the trophic structure of lakes is undertaken in the pampean region, high nutrient loading from the watershed, climate and hydrology should also be taken into account.

The calibrated bed roughness values, expressed in terms of Mannings n, range from 0.020 to 0.030.

Discharge estimates, based on this late winter ice cover calibration, measured water surface profiles, and documentation of major ice movements during April and May of 1992, show relatively good agreement with the discharge measurements taken at the same time.

We used the TEK of 16 First Nation hunters from the Eagle Village Algonquin community (Quebec, Canada) to evaluate moose (Alces americanus) habitat suitability in temperate deciduous forests, compared with a habitat suitability index (HSI) model. We found moderate to strong agreement between TEK and the HSI using Cohen's kappa (kappa = 0.46-0.63). According to the Algonquin hunters, wetlands and lakes are frequented by moose to feed and to avoid temperature stress during warm summer days, something not taken into account by the HSI. Algonquin hunters also mentioned that unproductive areas are actively frequented by moose in the summer and during the rutting period, although they have a low weight in the HSI calculation. Also according to Algonquin hunters, mature coniferous stands and large-size regenerating areas are rarely used by moose. While the moose HSI model was developed in boreal mixed and coniferous forests, we have shown that it could also be used in temperate deciduous forests. It could be improved, however, to better correspond to TEK, notably by including wetlands and lakes, increasing the weight of unproductive stands and reducing weights of mature coniferous and regenerating stands.					; Asselin, Hugo/H-9980-2013; Imbeau, Louis/A-6642-2009	Imbeau, Louis/0000-0003-4111-8059; Asselin, Hugo/0000-0002-9542-4994; 													1195-6860	2376-7626					2016	23	3-4					77	87		10.1080/11956860.2016.1263923	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11956860.2016.1263923													WOS:000397055800003

Such clear water phases are also important as windows of opportunity for recovery of aquatic vegetation and biodiversity in shallow waters. Here we use long time series from 71 shallow lakes to demonstrate that the probability of clear water phase increases with the temperature of take water. We demonstrate that lake temperature has risen significantly over the past decades and is highly correlated with oscillations in the North Atlantic climate system. We also show a distinct climate-related shift in the timing of clear water phases in the shallow lakes as well as in an independent set of central European takes.

Collared sand martins (Riparia riparia) breeding in the western Palaearctic spend the nonbreeding period in Africa, but it is not yet clear whether specific populations differ in overwintering locations and whether these also result in varying infections with vector-transmitted endoparasites. Results Geolocator tracking revealed that collared sand martins from northern-central and central-eastern Europe migrate to distant nonbreeding sites in West Africa and the Lake Chad basin in central Africa, respectively. While the ranges of these populations were clearly separated throughout the year, they consistently spent up to 60% of the annual cycle in Africa. Ambient light recorded by geolocators further indicated unsheltered roosting during the nonbreeding season in Africa compared to the breeding season in Europe. We found 5-26% prevalence of haemosporidian parasites in three breeding populations and one migratory passage population that was only sampled but not tracked. In total, we identified seven Plasmodium and nine Haemoproteus lineages (incl. two and seven new lineages, respectively), the latter presumably typical for swallows (Hirundinae) hosts. 99.5% of infections had a low intensity, typical for chronic infection stages, whereas three individuals (0.5%) showed high parasitaemia typical for acute infections during spring migration and breeding. Conclusions Our study shows that blood parasite infections are common in several western Palaearctic breeding populations of collared sand martins who spent the nonbreeding season in West Africa and the lake Chad region. Due to long residency at the nonbreeding grounds blood parasite transmissions may mainly occur at host population-specific residences sites in Europe and Africa; the latter being likely facilitated by unsheltered roosting and thus high vulnerability to hematophagous insects. The rare cases of high parasitaemia during spring migration and breeding further indicates either relapses of chronic infection or primary infections which occurred shortly before migration and during breeding.					; Szép, Tibor/HTN-1072-2023; Briedis, Martins/H-6172-2019; Emmenegger, Tamara/N-2861-2019	Szep, Tibor/0000-0002-4569-7425; Emmenegger, Tamara/0000-0002-2839-6129; Barboutis, Christos/0000-0002-5644-4327; Briedis, Martins/0000-0002-9434-9056; 														2056-3132				APR 20	2021	6	1							6	10.1186/s40850-021-00071-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40850-021-00071-z								37170335					WOS:000641794200001

To recover the lake water quality, a series of externally and internally remedial actions were implemented in subsequent years. The applied sewage collecting system induced a reduction of the external P loads from 50 t P year(-1) to 16t P year(-1) and the weighted mean annual TP concentration decreased from 352 mu g P l(-1) to 85 mu g P l(-1), typical of eutrophic conditions. The hypolimnetic water withdrawals, adopted in the years 2000-2003, allowed a reduction of the internal P loads of about 3-5 t P. In the same years, 500t O-2 were injected at depths of 4.5-8 m during the summer months. In spite of these internal remedial actions, no significant reduction of the weighted mean annual concentration of the TP could be observed, and during the summer stratification period no significant reduction of the volumes of anoxic water and of the duration of the anoxia were detected. The anoxic conditions are still the prevailing force driving the lake P-budget, maintaining the lake in eutrophic status.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				AUG	2007	8	2					155	160		10.1007/s10201-007-0209-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-007-0209-1													WOS:000248820400008

Holocene floristic diversity and richness in northeast Norway revealed by sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) and pollen	BOREAS												We present a Holocene record of floristic diversity and environmental change for the central Varanger Peninsula, Finnmark, based on ancient DNA extracted from the sediments of a small lake (sedaDNA). The record covers the period c. 10700 to 3300cal. a BP and is complemented by pollen data. Measures of species richness, sample evenness and beta diversity were calculated based on sedaDNA sampling intervals and 1000-year time windows. We identified 101 vascular plant and 17 bryophyte taxa, a high proportion (86%) of which are still growing within the region today. The high species richness (>60 taxa) observed in the Early Holocene, including representatives from all important plant functional groups, shows that modern shrub-tundra communities, and much of their species complement, were in place as early as c. 10700cal. a BP. We infer that postglacial colonization of the area occurred prior to the full Holocene, during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, Younger Dryas stadial or earlier. Abundant DNA of the extra-limital aquatic plant Callitriche hermaphroditica suggests it expanded its range northward between c.10200 and 9600cal. a BP, when summers were warmer than present. High values of Pinus DNA occur throughout the record, but we cannot say with certainty if they represent prior local presence; however, pollen influx values >500 grains cm(-2) a(-1) between c.8000 and 7300cal. a BP strongly suggest the presence of pine woodland during this period. As the site lies beyond the modern tree limit of pine, it is likely that this expansion also reflects a response to warmer Early Holocene summers.

J	Walton-Day, K; Poeter, E				Walton-Day, Katherine; Poeter, Eileen			Investigating hydraulic connections and the origin of water in a mine tunnel using stable isotopes and hydrographs	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Turquoise Lake is a water-supply reservoir located north of the historic Sugarloaf Mining district near Leadville, Colorado, USA. Elevated water levels in the reservoir may increase flow of low-quality water from abandoned mine tunnels in the Sugarloaf District and degrade water quality downstream. The objective of this study was to understand the sources of water to Dinero mine drainage tunnel and evaluate whether or not there was a direct hydrologic connection between Dinero mine tunnel and Turquoise Lake from late 2002 to early 2008. This study utilized hydrograph data from nearby draining mine tunnels and the lake, and stable isotope (delta O-18 and delta H-2) data from the lake, nearby draining mine tunnels, imported water, and springs to characterize water sources in the study area. Hydrograph results indicate that flow from the Dinero mine tunnel decreased 26% (2006) and 10% (2007) when lake elevation (above mean sea level) decreased below approximately 3004 m (approximately 9855 feet). Results I of isotope analysis delineated two meteoric water lines in the study area. One line characterizes surface water and water imported to the study area from the western side of the Continental Divide. The other line characterizes groundwater including draining mine tunnels, springs, and seeps. Isotope mixing calculations indicate that water from Turquoise Lake or seasonal groundwater recharge from snowmelt represents approximately 10% or less of the water in Dinero mine tunnel. However, most of the water in Dinero mine tunnel is from deep groundwater having minimal isotopic variation. The asymmetric shape of the Dinero mine tunnel hydrograph may indicate that a limited mine pool exists behind a collapse in the tunnel and attenutates seasonal recharge. Alternatively, a conceptual model is presented (and supported with MODFLOW simulations) that is consistent with current and previous data collected in the study area, and illustrates how fluctuating lake levels change the local water-table elevation which can affect discharge from the Dinero mine tunnel without physical transfer of water between the two 1,locations.

A multiple-approach radiometric age estimate for the Rotoiti and Earthquake Flat eruptions, New Zealand, with implications for the MIS 4/3 boundary	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Pyroclastic fall deposits of the paired Rotoiti and Earthquake Flat eruptions from the Taupo Volcanic Zone (New Zealand) combine to form a widespread isochronous horizon over much of northern New Zealand and the southwest Pacific. This horizon is important for correlating climatic and environmental changes during the Last Glacial period, but has been the subject of numerous disparate age estimates between 35.1 +/- 2.8 and 71 +/- 6 ka (all errors are 1 s.d.), obtained by a variety of techniques. A potassium-argon (K-Ar) age of 64 +/- 4 ka was previously determined on bracketing lavas Lit Mayor Island volcano, offshore from the Taupo Volcanic Zone. We present a new, more-precise 40Ar/39Ar age determination on a lava flow on Mayor Island, that shortly post-dates the Rotoiti/Earthquake Flat fall deposits, of 58.5 +/- 1.1 ka. This value, coupled with existing ages from underlying lavas, yield a new estimate for the age of the combined eruptions of 61.0 +/- 1.4 ka. which is consistent with U-Th disequilibrium model-age data for zircons from the Rotoiti deposits. Direct 40Ar/39Ar age determinations of plagioclase and biotite from the Rotoiti and Earthquake Flat eruption products yield variable values between 49.6 +/- 2.8 and 125.3 +/- 10.0 ka, with the scatter attributed to low radiogenic Ar yields, and/or alteration, and/or inheritance of xenocrystic material with inherited Ar. Rotoiti/Earthquake Flat fall deposits occur in New Zealand in association with palynological indicators of mild climate, attributed to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 and thus used to suggest an age that is post-59 ka. The natures of the criteria used to define the MIS 4/3 boundary in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, however, imply that the new 61 ka age for the Rotoiti/Earthquake Flat eruption deposits will provide the inverse, namely, a more accurate isochronous marker for correlating diverse changes across the MIS 4/3 boundary in the southwest Pacific.

J	Collen, P; Gibson, RJ				Collen, P; Gibson, RJ			The general ecology of beavers (Castor spp.), as related to their influence on stream ecosystems and riparian habitats, and the subsequent effects on fish - a review	REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES												The Eurasian and North American beavers are similar in their ecological requirements, and require water deep enough to cover the entrance to their lodge or burrow. A food cache is often built next to the lodge or burrow, except in some southern areas. On small streams (up to fourth order) dams are frequently built to create an impoundment, generally on low gradient streams, although at high population densities dams may be built on steeper gradient streams. On large rivers or in lakes, simply a lodge with its food cache may be built. The beaver is a keystone riparian species in that the landscape can be considerably altered by its activities and a new ecosystem created. The stream above a dam changes from lotic to lentic conditions. There are hydrological, temperature and chemical changes, depending on types of dams and locations. Although the invertebrates may be fewer per unit area, total number of organisms increases, and diversity increases as the pond ages. In cool, small order streams, the impoundments provide better habitat for large trout, possibly creating angling opportunities. However, at sites where water temperatures rise above their optimum preferenda, salmonids may be replaced by other species, such as cyprinids, catostomids, percids or centrarchids. As the habitat is altered, interactions amongst co-habiting species may change. For example, brown trout or brook trout (charr) may become dominant over Atlantic salmon. In warm water streams there may be a shift from faster water dwellers to pond dwellers. Larger bodied fish, such as centrarchids and esocids may displace smaller bodied fish such as cyprinids, providing better angling. Refugia from high or low water flows, low oxygen or high temperatures, may be provided in adverse conditions in winter or summer. However, in some cases dams are obstructions to upstream migration, and sediment may be deposited in former spawning areas. The practicality and benefits of introducing or restoring beaver populations will vary according to location, and should be considered in conjunction with a management plan to control their densities.																			0960-3166	1573-5184					2001	10	4					439	461																WOS:000171812600003

Low-latitude Holocene hydroclimate derived from lake sediment flux and geochemistry	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												This study investigates hydrological responses to climatic shifts using sediment flux data derived from two dated palaeolake records in south-east Arabia. Flux values are generally low during the early Holocene humid period (EHHP) (approximate to 9.0-6.4k cal a BP) although several short-lived pulses of increased detrital input are recorded, the most prominent of which is dated between approximate to 8.3 and 7.9k cal a BP. The EHHP is separated from the mid-Holocene humid period (MHHP) (approximate to 5.0-4.3k cal a BP) by a phase of increased sediment flux and aridity, which began between approximate to 6.4 and 5.9k cal a BP and peaked between approximate to 5.2 and 5.0k cal a BP. The termination of the MHHP is marked by a phase of high detrital sediment flux between approximate to 4.3 and 3.9k cal a BP. While long-term shifts in climate are most likely linked to changes in the summer position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and associated Indian and African monsoon systems, it is noted that the abrupt, short-term phases of aridity observed in both records are coeval with intervals of rapid climate change globally, which triggered non-linear, widespread landscape reconfigurations throughout south-east Arabia.

The data base, generated on the Canadian Landsat Production System, was systematically processed for radiometric correction and atmospheric correction based on clear lakes as standard reflectors and accounting for the background contamination effect. The reflectance values of selected gravel pit sites, which we demonstrate to be stable reflectors, are analyzed as a function of time. The significant and regular variations observed permit the determination of correction coefficients for inter-satellite calibration between the sensors of Landsats 1-5. The resulting coherent time series of corrected reflectances shows a mean seasonal variation for the vegetation phenology (between May and October) which can be modeled by a regression function of the form (t - t0)sin[(t-t0)2 .pi./T] for the two near-IR MSS bands. The ground reflectances of the four bands are summed over and combined to compute the long-term "MSS albedo" and normalized vegetation index (NVI) variations. These parameters are analyzed with regard to meteorological variations. The results show that, for the Montreal study area, the yearly mean albedo underwent a significant decreasing trend (-0.05) since 1972 due to processes of urbanization, deforestation, and decreasing farmland. The effects of these respective land-surface alterations are discussed. For the whole data base, the year-to-year NVI fluctuations correlate with the cumulative amount of summer precipitation which in turn is related to the mean summer evapotranspiration and global solar radiation.

Prior to snowmelt, equal numbers of Assinica and Temiscamie strain fry were placed into enclosures. Twelve days after stocking, no consistent differences between strains were observed in survival, distribution, or ion composition. No fry of either strain survived in enclosures placed in shallow water (pH 4.8; 0.7 m depth). Fifty to 100% of fry of both strains survived in enclosures placed in deep water (pH 6.3; >2.0 m depth). Fry survival in long enclosures that extended from shallow to deep water was 80-99%. Within long enclosures, both strains were recovered in higher densities from middle and deep sections of the enclosures than from shallow sections. High fry survival and non-random distributions in the long enclosures indicated that both strains were able to avoid lethal, nearshore waters during spring snowmelt by moving to deeper water.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				APR	1994	51	4					792	799											27912262					WOS:A1994NR09800003

Air temperature determined the lake water pH throughout the past 200 yr almost regardless of the level of atmospheric deposition. Our data suggest a strong climate forcing of the acid-base balance in sensitive high-altitude lakes. Their physico-chemical conditions and biota strongly depend on the duration of ice and snow cover which is significantly different between warm and cold periods. Beside changes in weathering rates, in-lake alkalinity generation and water-retention time, delayed freezing in autumn and earlier ice-out dates with a shorter duration of CO(2) over-saturation could be crucial for the tight temperature-pH coupling.

J	Fieseler, C; Wolter, C				Fieseler, C; Wolter, C			A fish-based typology of small temperate rivers in the northeastern lowlands of Germany	LIMNOLOGICA												Fish assemblage data from 69 brooks and small streams were analysed to derive a fish-based typology of small lowland streams in the "Central Plains" ecoregion of northeastern Germany. Altogether 32 native, I non-native fish species and 2 lamprey species were detected in the lowland rivers studied. Species number and diversity varied significantly according to mean summer water temperatures and size of the watercourses. Summer-cold brooks contained on average 3-5 species, brooks with higher summer temperatures 5-8 species and small lowland rivers around 10-14 species. Small lowland brooks contained a significantly higher number of fish species when they flowed into or out of lakes: typically around 8-12. In the northeastern German lowlands the following three different river types were distinguished according to their fish assemblages: (1) The "lowland trout brook", where brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) are reference species and accompanied by stone loach (Barbatula barbatula (L.)), brook lamprey (Lampetra planeri (Bloch)), three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.), ten-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius (L.)) and gudgeon (Gobio gobio (L.)); (2) The "perch- and roach-dominated lowland brook", where perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) and roach (Rutilus rutilus (L.)) are reference species, accompanied by pike (Esox lucius L.), three-spined stickleback and gudgeon; and (3) The "lowland lake connected brook" inhabited by higher numbers of fish species, with higher proportions of cyprinid fishes, and higher proportions of limnophilic fish. Apart from perch and roach, bleak (Alburnus alburnus (L.)), common bream (Abramis brama (L.)), silver bream (Blieca bjoerkna (L.)) and rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus (L.)) also occurred frequently. Further two observed fish-based types were not considered: The potential stone loach-dominated brook was not sufficiently represented in this study to be verified, and the stickleback brook was considered to represent degradation of lowland trout brooks. The correspondence between the fish-based typology and the morphology-based German stream typology was rather weak and requires further investigation. (C) 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

During winter, the central lake usually remains open, while sand-charged ice formed in coastal waters in displaced lakeward from the western shore in long, sinuous bands by offshore winds. Under some conditions, these ice streamers are dissipated within 2 to 20 km from the coast. This occurred during offshore collection of ice-rafted sand and gravel, demonstrating a net loss of beach sand from the windward shore to deep water. Under other conditions, ice streamers can cross the lake, leading to ice accumulations at the downwind or lee shore. Northwesterly winds dominate winter weather, so ice accumulations form mainly in the southeastern end of the lake, where they ultimately melt. Thus, ice rafting may be partly responsible for net sediment progradation at this southeastern, lee shore during the last few thousand years, and adds course grains to basin muds.																			0749-0208					SUM	1991	7	3					653	664																WOS:A1991FW19500006
J	Michaletz, PH				Michaletz, PH			Factors affecting abundance, growth, and survival of age-0 gizzard shad	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Factors affecting abundance, growth, and survival of age-0 gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum were examined in Pomme de Terre and Stockton lakes, Missouri, during 1987-1991. Otolith ages were used to assign larvae (less than or equal to 25 mm total length, TL) and juveniles (>25 mm TL) to weekly cohorts so that cohort-specific estimates of abundance, growth, and survival could be made. The distribution of initial abundances of larvae among weekly cohorts was influenced by water temperature and reservoir water level but not by characteristics of adult females (abundance, size, condition, fecundity). Intense periods of spawning activity during rising water levels resulted in high peaks in larval abundance and relatively few large weekly cohorts (e.g., 1990). In the absence of water level rises, peaks in larval abundance were much lower and abundances of larvae were more evenly distributed among several cohorts (e.g., 1988). Spring warming also affected spawning; early cohorts in warm springs (1987 and 1991) were relatively more abundant than those during cool springs (1989 and 1990). The initial distribution of larvae among weekly cohorts influenced subsequent interactions between the larvae and their environment. Growth of larvae was positively affected by water temperature and, to a lesser degree, food abundance. Early cohorts grew slower because of lower water temperatures, and they suffered higher mortality than did late cohorts. Survival was also density dependent; weekly cohorts with high initial densities experienced lower survival than cohorts with small initial densities. High survival of larvae occurred in 1988 when densities of larvae were low and evenly distributed among weekly cohorts and food abundance was high. Growth and instantaneous mortality of juveniles were not closely tied to any single variable. Growth was positively related to food abundance and negatively related to gizzard shad density. Mortality was not significantly related to any measured variable. Overall, findings indicate that cohort dynamics of age-0 gizzard shad are initially driven by climatic factors and later by a combination of climatic and biotic factors.																			0002-8487					JAN	1997	126	1					84	100		10.1577/1548-8659(1997)126<0084:FAAGAS>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1997)126<0084:FAAGAS>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1997WK86900007

Decreasing stream pH and alkalinity and increasing NO3 (-) concentrations were observed throughout the 1990s in the forested Lake Ijira catchment in central Japan. We investigated these changes using data on atmospheric deposition, soil chemistry, stream water chemistry, and forest growth. Average atmospheric depositions (wet + dry) of 0.83, 0.57, and 1.37 kmol ha(-1) year(-1) for hydrogen, sulfur, and nitrogen, respectively, were among the highest levels in Japan. Atmospheric deposition generally decreased before 1994 and increased thereafter. The catchment was acid-sensitive; stream alkalinity was low (134 mu mol(c) l(-1)) and pH in surface mineral soils decreased from 4.5 in 1990 to 3.9 in 2003. Stream NO3 (-) concentration nearly doubled (from 22 to 42 mu mol(c) l(-1)) from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. Stream NO3 (-) concentration was controlled primarily by water temperature before 1996/1997 and by stream discharge thereafter. Stream NO3 (-) concentrations decreased during the growing season before 1996/1997, but this seasonality was lost thereafter. The catchment became nitrogen-saturated (changing from stage 1 to 2) in 1996/1997, possibly because of declining forest growth rates due to the 1994 summer drought, defoliation of Japanese red pine by pine wilt disease, maturation of Japanese cedar stands, and stimulation of nitrogen mineralization and nitrification due to alkalinization of soils (increased exchangeable Ca2+ and soil pH) after the summer drought. Stream pH and alkalinity began decreasing in 1996/1997. The enhanced growing-season NO3 (-) discharge since 1996/1997 appeared to be the major cause of stream acidification. Increased atmospheric deposition since 1994 may have contributed to this change.

For example, nitrogen is considered the main nutrient limiting phytoplankton in floodplain lakes of the Parana River basin. However, N-2-fixing heterocystous cyanobacteria (N-2-cyano) are usually absent in these water bodies. The low pH values frequently found may limit the development of these algae. We hypothesise that long-term lake isolation allows conspicuous phytoplankton growth during summer, resulting in high photosynthetic rates and pH. This scenario combined with low DIN (dissolved inorganic nitrogen) would favour the development of N-2-cyano. Phytoplankton composition was studied during 16 months in a vegetated and isolated floodplain lake in the Parana basin. Additionally, pH was artificially increased in in situ mesocosms to test effects on phytoplankton structure. Lake phytoplankton was dominated by flagellates (cryptophytes and euglenophytes) and small coccoid algae (chlorophytes and colonial cyanobacteria). Algal biomass was highest during warm periods. Although pH increased up to 8.8 during the second summer period, N-2-cyano remained rare, most likely because of the high DIN concentration recorded. The alkalophilic diatom Cyclotella meneghiniana dominated and was positively correlated with pH. Conversely, PO (4) (=) concentrations in the mesocosm experiment were high and DIN remained relatively low. pH enhancement in the treated mesocosms (avg. pH = 8.2) promoted the development of N-2-cyano (Anabaena spp.) and C. meneghiniana, which after 1 month of incubation accounted together for 50% of the biomass in contrast to less than 1.6% in control containers. Our results support the hypothesis that during the warm season and under low DIN concentration, high pH favours N-2-cyano growth in these lakes. We provide new evidence supporting the idea that even under optimal nutrient conditions, N-2-cyano do not thrive unless other requirements are satisfied.

Two of them were large (73.6 and 118.6 ha) and deep (up to 10.6 and 12.3 m) mature lakes embedded into all geomorphological levels of the peninsula, and two others were smaller (3.2 and 4.2 ha) shallow (2.3 and 1.8 m) lakes which were formed as a result of thermokarst on constitutional (segregated) ground ice. Samples were collected in August 2019. The Yamal tundra lakes were found to exhibit high phytoplankton production (340-1200 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) during the short summer season. Allochthonous and autochthonous, particulate and dissolved organic matter was deposited onto the bottom sediments, where methane was the main product of anaerobic degradation, and its content was 33-990 mu mol CH4 dm(-3). The rates of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis appeared to be higher in the sediments of deep lakes than in those of the shallow ones. In the sediments of all lakes, Methanoregula and Methanosaeta were predominant components of the archaeal methanogenic community. Methane oxidation (1.4-9.9 mu mol dm(-3) d(-1)) occurred in the upper sediment layers simultaneously with methanogenesis. Methylobacter tundripaludum (family Methylococcaceae) predominated in the methanotrophic community of the sediments and the water column. The activity of methanotrophic bacteria in deep mature lakes resulted in a decrease in the dissolved methane concentration in lake water from 0.8-4.1 to 0.4 mu mol CH4 L-1 d(-1), while in shallow thermokarst lakes the geochemical effect of methanotrophs was much less pronounced. Thus, only small, shallow Yamal lakes may contribute significantly to the overall diffusive methane emissions from the water surface during the warm summer season. The water column of large, deep lakes on Yamal acts, however, as a microbial filter preventing methane emission into the atmosphere. It can be assumed that climate warming will lead to an increase in the total area of thermokarst lakes, which will enhance the effect of methane release into the atmosphere.

J	Kullman, L				Kullman, L			Early Holocene appearance of Mountain Birch (Betula pubescens ssp tortuosa) at unprecedented high elevations in the Swedish Scandes: Megafossil evidence exposed by recent snow and ice recession	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Megafossil wood remnants (trunks and roots) of mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa) were retrieved from the alpine tundra of the southern Swedish Scandes (the Sylama Mountains). The samples have recently become exposed by rapid recession of glaciers and snow patches at three sites located 630 to 350 m higher than the present-day birch tree-limit and 350 to 80 m higher than the early Holocene pine limit. Radiocarbon dating yielded ages ranging between 8700 and 6200 B.P. (9700-7000 cal B.P.). This is the first direct evidence of past tree growth at such high elevations in the Scandes, relative to the modem tree-limit. The overall situation with uniquely high tree-limits and absence of glaciers suggests a climate with generally drier and warmer summers than during any later part (secular-millennial scale) of the Holocene. Corrected for glacioisostatic land-uplift, summers around 8700 B.P. may have been about 3degreesC warmer than at present. This inference is compatible with the Milankovitch model of orbital climate forcing during the course of the Holocene, implying a gradually increasing maritime climate (less seasonal), with a heavier snowpack. As a consequence, alpine snowfields started to develop over the period 8700-6200 B.P., causing demise and burial of the highest metapopulations of mountain birch. At lower elevations, where snow accumulation had previously been suboptimal for birch, this species could now benefit from a deeper and more persistent snow cover. Since about 7000 B.P., a distinct mountain birch belt has been a characteristic feature in this pan of the Scandes. The exposure of mountain birch megafossils relates to substantial 20th-century warming, reaching a peak in the past few years. Evidently, this is an exceptional occurrence in the context of several past millennia.																			1523-0430	1938-4246				MAY	2004	36	2					172	180		10.1657/1523-0430(2004)036[0172:EHAOMB]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1523-0430(2004)036[0172:EHAOMB]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000225548300005

Assessment of Lake Sturgeon Reintroduction in the Coosa River System, Georgia-Alabama	BALANCING FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND WATER USES FOR IMPOUNDED RIVER SYSTEMS	American Fisheries Society Symposium				4th North American Reservoir Symposium on Balancing Fisheries Management and Water Uses for Impounded River Systems	JUN 07-09, 2007	Atlanta, GA	Amer Fisheries Soc, SE Div Reservoir Comm				At the extreme Southern boundary of its range, the lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens was once an important biological component of the Coosa River system of Georgia-Alabama. During the 1970s, the Population was extirpated by the combined effects of overfishing and degraded water quality. Over the past 20 years, water quality has improved, and in 2002, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources initiated a lake Sturgeon reintroduction program with the goal of establishing a self-sustaining population within 20 years. Front 2004, to 2007, we evaluated the initial phase of this reintroduction program by quantifying poststocking survival and seasonal habitat use of Juvenile lake sturgeon in the Coosa River. We used gill nets and trammel nets to capture juveniles at several locations in both riverine and reservoir habitats. Fourteen individual Juveniles were randomly selected for surgical implantation of radio tags to monitor their seasonal movements and habitat use. Over the 3 years of the Study, we captured a total of 597 Juvenile lake sturgeon measuring 231-790 nun total length. Using capture probabilities calculated from Program MARK (White and Burnham 1999), we estimated a total abundance of 789 (690-889, 95% confidence interval) juvenile lake sturgeon in 2006. Survival of each cohort from date stocked to Summer 2006 varied from 1% to 14%, depending on year and size of fish stocked. Seasonal movements of Juveniles varied; however, most fish occupied a relatively short reach in the lower river (hiring summer months when water temperatures were more than 25 degrees C. At least 1% of fish stocked in each cohort have survived. and the population appears to be gradually increasing with each additional year of stocking. Further studies are needed to monitor annual recruitment and to evaluate reproductive success as first cohorts reach maturity.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-06-6				2008	62						571	586																WOS:000263597300037

Technological and Dietary Responses to Holocene Climate Events in the Northern Great Basin	CALIFORNIA ARCHAEOLOGY												Environmental instability caused by extended periods of drought no doubt impacted past human populations by limiting economic options and driving changes in social and technological organization. Here we examine two sets of Great Basin sites with occupations spanning the middle and late Holocene droughts: one associated with lowland springs and another with upland springs. We use dietary markers retrieved via starch granule analysis to evaluate whether artifact form relates to resources processed, how changes in tool form might be related to past changes in climate, environment, and social organization, and what, if any, differences mark upland vs. lowland resource use. Our data suggest that changes in tool form track with environmental fluctuations and that in both upland and lowland settings diets focused primarily on tubers and high-return seeds and that these profitable and stable food sources likely anchored populations during periods of drought.

Ten stations, all with water depth > 2m, were established and sampled quantitatively by removing 4 benthic subsamples (containing as much as 25 cm overlying water) from replicated box cores. Averaged across stations over time, total copepod densities ranged from 31-89 .times. 10 cm-2. A total of only 15 copepod spp. were identified from benthic samples; 8 harpacticoids [Pseudobradya sp., Scottolana canadensis, Nitrocra lacustris, Enhydrosoma sp., Pseudostenhelia wellsi, Onychocampus mohammed, Microarthridion littorale and schizopera knabeni], 4 cyclopoids [Halicyclops coulli, H. fosteri, Mesocyclops edax and Cyclops bicolor] and 3 calanoids [Acartia tonsa, Eurytemora affinis, and 1 unidentified calanoid]. The copepod assemblage in Pontchartrain differs from all other known benthic assemblages in that the species composition is dominated by species which are often associated with the water column; true infaunal species are rare or found in reduced abundance. Four species comprised 90% of all individuals collected. All 4 are epibenthic or commonly collected as zooplankton and include S. canadensis which comprised 47% of all individuals collected, H. fosteri which dominated fall collections, A. tonsa and Pseudobradya sp. Burrowing species were largely restricted to the more saline eastern stations. The rarity of burrowing species might be related to low salinity; the highly unstable bottom in Pontchartrain with silty-clayey sediments commonly resuspended into the water column, may also influence burrowers. Cluster analysis reveals diffuse seasonal grouping of stations for all seasons except fall, with spatial groupings from the central and western sides. Physical processes appear to dictate the community structure of benthic-hyperbenthic copepods in Lake Pontchartrain.

Carbon dynamics in an ultra-oligotrophic epishelf lake (Beaver Lake, Antarctica) in summer	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Microbial plankton dynamics in an ultra-oligotrophic epishelf lake (Beaver Lake, Antarctica) were investigated over an austral summer (December 2002 to January 2003). The aim was to characterise carbon cycling in an environmentally extreme lake. 2. The lake had an unusual temperature profile with peak temperatures of 1.3-1.9 degrees C between 20 and 25 m. Photosynthetically active radiation penetrated to the lake bottom (110 m) on occasions. The ice cover underwent marked thinning and melting during the study period. 3. Chlorophyll a concentrations were consistently low, usually below 1 mu g L-1, with highest concentrations close to the lake bottom, where the photosynthetic elements showed strong autofluorescence. Mean photosynthetic nanoflagellates ranged between 34.9 x 10(4) L-1 +/- 33.5 (23rd December) and 130.9 x 10(4) L-1 +/- 112.3 (4th December). Highest photosynthetic activity was usually recorded below 25 m. Rates of carbon fixation varied between 0.089 mu g C L-1 h(-1) +/- 0.002 and 0.579 mu g C L-1 h(-1) +/- 0.156. Primary production was limited by low temperature and orthophosphate availability. 4. Mean bacterial concentration throughout the water column ranged between 9.3 x 10(7) L-1 +/- 1.2 (23rd December) and 14.0 x 10(7) L-1 +/- 1.8 (28th January). Bacterial production was low, less than 10% of primary production and ranged between 2.1 ng C L-1 h(-1) +/- 0.8 and 12 ng C L-1 h(-1) +/- 0.9. Highest rates coincided with times of highest primary production. On occasion dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations dropped to 20 mu g L-1, probably below accurate limits of detection, suggesting that carbon substratum and phosphorus may have limited bacterial growth. 5. Heterotrophic nanoflagellates varied significantly over the summer from a mean of 26.6 x 10(4) L-1 +/- 14.2 (23rd December) to 133.8 x 10(4) L-1 +/- 33.5 (14th December). They imposed a significant grazing impact on the bacterioplankton, removing in excess of 100% of bacterial production in December. 6. The total organic carbon pool [DOC and particulate organic carbon (POC)] was below 600 mu g L-1. The ratio of DOC : POC ranged between 0.44 : 1 and 2.8 : 1 in the upper 40 m of the water column, and 1.8 : 1 and 3.7 : 1 in the lower waters. The microbial plankton contributed 1-29% of POC, thus detrital POC made up the largest fraction of the POC pool. 7. Beaver Lake is an extreme lacustrine ecosystem where heterotrophic processes occasionally appear to be carbon limited. Significant summer ice-melt, not seen in a previous opportunistic sampling, may be having an impact on the carbon cycle.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	2006	51	6					1116	1130		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01560.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01560.x													WOS:000237692800011

J	Kim, J; Kim, TH				Kim, Jeonghyun; Kim, Tae-Hoon			Distribution of Humic Fluorescent Dissolved Organic Matter in Lake Shihwa: the Role of the Redox Condition	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Hypoxia has occurred worldwide in coastal and marginal oceans. The redox condition has recently garnered major interest as a favorable condition for delivering sedimentary organic matter to the water column. In this study, we measured the fluorescence of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) in brackish Lake Shihwa, Korea, in which hypoxic conditions are typically observed during summer. Especially, fluorescent intensities of the humic FDOM (FDOMH) were relatively high during summer, with a relatively lower dissolved oxygen (DO) level, and exponentially increased with decreasing DO concentrations. The results indicated that the production of FDOMH is associated with anaerobic processes. It was further supported by a significantly positive relationship between FDOMH and ammonium. Based on the relatively low values of redox potential (up to 60.0 mV) and high concentration of phosphate with the low DO level, this enrichment of FDOMH seems to be linked to the input of anoxic porewater. Using a simple schematic diagram, the contribution of FDOMH from reducing environments is comparable to that from stream water, which is known to be a major source in coastal regions. This study highlights that the redox condition is a key factor contributing to the production of FDOMH in coastal marine environments.					; ­, 이승훈[ 교수 / 의학과 ]/GLN-6251-2022	Kim, Jeonghyun/0000-0001-6839-5721; 													1559-2723	1559-2731				MAY	2020	43	3			SI		578	588		10.1007/s12237-018-00491-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-018-00491-0													WOS:000521748400012

Ice-melt period dominates annual carbon dioxide evasion from clear-water Arctic lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												Current estimates of carbon dioxide (CO2) evasion from Arctic lakes are highly uncertain because few studies integrate seasonal variability, specifically evasion during spring ice-melt. We quantified annual CO2 evasion for 14 clear-water Arctic lakes in Northern Sweden through mass balance (ice-melt period) and high-frequency loggers (open-water period). On average, 80% (SD: +/- 18) of annual CO2 evasion occurred within 10 d following ice-melt. The contribution of the ice-melt period to annual CO2 evasion was high compared to earlier studies of Arctic lakes (47% +/- 32%). Across all lakes, the proportion of ice-melt : annual CO2 evasion was negatively related to the dissolved organic carbon concentration and positively related to the mean depth of the lakes. The results emphasize the need for measurements of CO2 exchange at ice-melt to accurately quantify CO2 evasion from Arctic lakes.					; Klaus, Marcus/AAL-1818-2021	Vachon, Dominic/0000-0003-1157-5240; Verheijen, Hendricus/0000-0002-2858-6299; Karlsson, Jan/0000-0001-5730-0694; Klaus, Marcus/0000-0003-0747-3524														2378-2242				APR	2024	9	2					112	118		10.1002/lol2.10369	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10369		DEC 2023											WOS:001126709300001
J	Weber, RE; Weber, MJ				Weber, Robert E., III; Weber, Michael J.			Behaviour and survival of wild versus stocked fingerling walleye	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Walleye Sander vitreus Mitchill have been progressively raised in hatcheries to larger sizes under the paradigm that larger stocked fish have higher survival. However, extended time in hatcheries may result in domestication, with stocked individuals lacking behaviours that promote survival. The objective of this study was to evaluate behaviour and survival of wild versus stocked fingerling (>200 mm) walleye in two Iowa reservoirs. Radio telemetry was used to evaluate walleye movement rates, depth use, home range size, habitat selection and apparent survival. Depth use increased with days since stocking and varied between lake-years but was similar between walleye groups. Daily movement rates varied by the interaction between group and day, with rates declining through time. Home ranges did not differ between groups but were significantly greater in Big Creek than Brushy Creek. Walleye in both lakes generally used habitat in proportion to availability, with few differences between groups detected. Weekly apparent survival ranged from 0.948 to 1.000, varied across lakes, years and seasons, and was higher for stocked than wild walleye in Big Creek but not Brushy Creek. The results indicate that hatchery-reared fingerling walleye behave similar to but can have higher survival than wild fish, suggesting that domestication may not be occurring and that stocking autumn fingerling walleye may help supplement year-class strength.

This paper provides new data on bryophytes in mountain wetland habitats and at woodland edges recorded as new or reconfirmed occurrences in the administrative regions of Epirus, West Macedonia, Central Macedonia, and Central Greece. Scorpidium cossonii and Sphagnum russowii were found new to Greece. Most of the species belong to northern and high-altitude floristic elements and were encountered in moderately acidic fens, base-rich fens, flushes, nutrient-poor pools, wet meadows, mountain heaths and tall-forb vegetation. Many of the encountered species characterize Annex I habitats of the EU Habitats Directive, specifically 7230 'Alkaline fens', 7220 'Petrifying springs with tufa formation (Cratoneurion)', 7140 'Transition mires and quaking bogs', 6430 'Hydrophilous tall herb fringe communities of plains and of the montane to alpine levels', 4060 'Alpine and boreal heaths', and 3160 'Natural dystrophic lakes and ponds'.

However, our knowledge on seasonal and inter-annual variation in the composition and diversity of communities is still poor. Here, we investigated the seasonal and inter-annual changes in taxonomic and functional community composition and diversity of benthic diatoms in a coastal habitat of the northern Baltic Sea, where seasonal and inter-annual variation of climate is pronounced. We found that the taxonomic and functional alpha diversity remained stable at seasonal and inter-annual level despite strong changes in community composition. However, alpha diversity decreased during an exceptionally warm winter possibly due to disturbances induced by the lack of ice. This may suggest that climate warming and consequently limited ice cover will affect the diversity of benthic communities.

J	Halsey, LA; Vitt, DH; Bauer, IE				Halsey, LA; Vitt, DH; Bauer, IE			Peatland initiation during the Holocene in continental western Canada	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Today, the southern limit of peatlands in continental western Canada is largely limited by thermal seasonal aridity, although physiographic parameters of substrate texture, topography, and salinity also exsert important controls on the presence and absence of peatlands. Factors that control peatland distribution today also operated in the past, thus the initiation of peatlands during the Holocene was mainly limited by aridity and physiography. Calibrated radiocarbon dates of basal peat deposits from 90 locations across continental western Canada indicate that peat formation began approximately 8,000 to 9,000 years BP in nucleation zones along the upper elevations of the Montane region of Alberta and in northern Alberta uplands after an initial deglacial lag. Predictions of maximum early Holocene summer insolation by climate simulations provide a mechanism for limiting peatland establishment during the early Holocene. From 6,000 to 8,000 years ago, peat formation in continental western Canada expanded eastwards into Manitoba responding to decreases in summer insolation. Peatland expansion during the early Holocene was more extensive in Alberta than in Manitoba in response to a southwesterly shift in the Arctic front. The displacement of the Arctic front allowed for more frequent incursions of moist Pacific air into Alberta while limiting it in Manitoba After 6,000 years BP, the trend of southeasterly peatland expansion continued. Peatlands are youngest in the southern Boreal Forest and Aspen Parkland Region as well as in the lower elevations of the Peace-Wapiti River drainage basin, forming over the last 3,000 to 4,000 years. Peatlands are also young in the lower elevations of the Hudson Bay Lowlands where peat initiation has been limited by timing of emergence from glacial rebound. The spatial and temporal distribution of peatland initiation during the Holocene is verified by existing pollen records and corroborates some simulated climate models.																			0165-0009	1573-1480				OCT	1998	40	2					315	342		10.1023/A:1005425124749	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1005425124749													WOS:000076637300010
J	Liu, JS; Wang, SY; Yu, SM; Yang, DQ; Zhang, L				Liu, Jingshi; Wang, Siyuan; Yu, Shumei; Yang, Daqing; Zhang, Lu			Climate warming and growth of high-elevation inland lakes on the Tibetan Plateau	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												The growth of two high-elevation inland lakes (at 4600 m) was analyzed using satellite imagery (20002005) and data were collected over the last decade (1997-2006) at a plateau meteorological station (at 4820 m) and stream gauging data from a station (at 4250 m) in central Tibet. We examined the lake water balance responses to meteorological and hydrological variables. The results show that the lake areas greatly expanded by a maximum of 27.1% (or 43.7 km(2)) between 1998 and 2005. This expansion appears to be associated with an increase in annual precipitation of 51.0 mm (12.6%), mean annual and winter mean temperature increases of 0.41 degrees C and 0.71 degrees C, and an annual runoff increase of 20% during the last decade. The changes point to an abrupt increase in the annual precipitation, mean temperature and runoff occurring in 1996,1998 and 1997, respectively, and a decrease in the annual pan evaporation that happened in 1996. The timing of lake growth corresponds closely with abrupt increases in the annual precipitation and runoff and with the decrease in the annual evaporation since the mid-1990s. This study indicates a strong positive water balance in these permafrost highland lakes, and provides further evidence of lake growth as a proxy indicator of climate variability and change.

Biologically insignificant increases (1-2%) in embryo survival from eyed egg to hatch were observed for both of the thiamine treatment concentrations compared with nontreated controls, but no differences were observed in percent survival to the eyed stage, hatch, swim-up, or 28 d after swim-up. Egg thiamine concentrations ranged from 2.85 to 16.14 nmol/g of wet tissue in the control eggs. These results were probably influenced by unanticipated dietary shifts of adult salmon during an unusual year of very low availability of rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax. Neither thiamine hydrochloride treatment significantly elevated egg thiamine concentrations, but the detection of relatively small amounts of thiamine uptake was probably hindered by measurement variation. Thiamine hydrochloride treatments for 5 h did not increase eaa mortality and allowed hatchery personnel at remote spawning facilities to use alternative egg handling methods after water-hardening thiamine hydrochloride treatments.																			1522-2055					OCT	2001	63	4					338	342		10.1577/1548-8454(2001)063<0338:IOOTHT>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8454(2001)063<0338:IOOTHT>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000171790100013

The stable isotopic composition of bulk carbonates deposited in diverse late Eocene to Oligocene lakes within the eastern part of this endorheic region are investigated. Carbon and oxygen isotopes fall into several distinct hydrographic provinces which are partly palaeogeographical and partly biostratigraphical. The isotopic signatures of the lake carbonates primarily reflect the nature of the river input (duration, seasonality, catchment geology) and autochtonous processes within the lake (biological productivity, evaporation) but diagenetic changes may further complicate interpretations. Seasonal changes in precipitation rates are picked out by light-dark variations in single lithological cycles.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				JUL	1987	60	1-2					59	75		10.1016/0031-0182(87)90024-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(87)90024-1													WOS:A1987J744000003
J	James, WF; Barko, JW				James, WF; Barko, JW			Net and gross sedimentation in relation to the phosphorus budget of Eau Galle Reservoir, Wisconsin	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We compared P retention with direct measures of P sedimentation, estimated from sediment cores (annual P sedimentation) and sediment traps (daily P sedimentation), to quantify P sedimentation in Eau Galle Reservoir, Wisconsin. Mean annual P retention was similar to mean annual P sedimentation, as estimated from sediment core rates integrated over the entire lake basin, indicating that annual P mass balance approximated annual net P sedimentation in this reservoir. However, sediment trap P rates, measured over the summer stratified period, overestimated P retention rates determined over the same period, suggesting substantial deposition of internally-derived P. Inclusion of measured internal P loadings from a variety of sources in Eau Galle Reservoir in a P mass balance only accounted for an additional 24% of the summer sediment trap P rate, indicating substantial uncertainty in the overall P budget. Imbalances in the P budget may also suggest deposition of sediment from other as yet unquantified internal sources. Potential internal sources of P include sediment resuspension and chemical release and direct uptake of P from the sediment by phytoplankton.																			0018-8158					FEB 14	1997	345		1				15	20		10.1023/A:1002979315412	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1002979315412													WOS:A1997XK53700002

At the primary producer level, both algal biomass and productivity increased and chlorophyll accumulated on the river bottom in the first two summers. Diatom community composition changed little in spite of large chlorophyll changes. However, an increase in grazing insects prevented chlorophyll buildup in the third and fourth summers. Some microbial processes were also stimulated by the increased photosynthesis caused by fertilization. Total respiration of the epilithon, acetate uptake, and decomposition of lignin monomers were all stimulated but only in light-grown epilithon. When epilithon was grown in the dark in the fertilized region of the river, there was no increased respiration. Also, phosphorus did not stimulate the decomposition of Carex litter. Although insects grew more rapidly in the fertilized section of the river, there were community interactions that kept total insect production from appreciable change. The four most abundant large insects did increase their growth rates in response to phosphorus addition and there were increases in populations of Baetis lapponicus and Brachycentrus americanus. These increases were offset by the decline in abundance of the dominant species, the black fly Prosimulium martini, perhaps caused by competition for space from Brachycentrus. Growth of both young-of-the-year and adult grayling (Thymallus arcticus) was strongly stimulated by phosphorus addition in years 3 and 4 (not tested in years 1 and 2). Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope tracers indicated that the measured increases in insect and fish growth were largely attributable to increases in the production of epilithic algae. Overall, the results indicate a strong ''bottom-up'' response of the riverine food web to additions of the limiting nutrient, phosphorus. The response was modified in later years, however, by a strong ''top-down'' feedback of insects grazing on epilithic algae and by competitive exclusion of black flies by caddisflies.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				APR	1993	74	3					653	672		10.2307/1940794	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1940794													WOS:A1993KU39900002

We investigated the seasonality of environmental chlamydiae in a Tyrrhenian coastal lake. By catalysed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization, we quantified the small planktonic cells and detected a peak in the abundance of environmental chlamydiae in early autumn with up to 5.9x10(4) cells ml(-1). Super-resolution microscopy improved the visualization and quantification of these bacteria and enabled the detection of pleomorphic chlamydial cells in their protist host directly in an environmental sample. To isolate environmental chlamydiae together with their host, we applied a high-throughput limited dilution approach and successfully recovered a Vexillifera sp., strain harbouring chlamydiae (93% 16S rRNA sequence identity to Simkania negevensis), tentatively named CandidatusNeptunochlamydia vexilliferae'. Transmission electron microscopy in combination with fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to prove the intracellular location of these bacteria representing the first strain of marine chlamydiae stably maintained alongside with their host in a laboratory culture. Taken together, this study contributes to a better understanding of the distribution and diversity of environmental chlamydiae in previously neglected marine environments.

J	IRMLER, U				IRMLER, U			CONSIDERATIONS ON STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE CENTRAL-AMAZONIAN INUNDATION FOREST ECOSYSTEM WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON SELECTED SOIL ANIMALS	OECOLOGIA												Studies were conducted in Central-Amazonian inundation forests having seasonal inundations during the emersion phase (e.p.) and the submersion phase (s.p.). Two varzea forests (white water areas), 1 in the Amazon valley on Ilha de Curari and 1 at Lago Janauari, and an igapo (black water area) situated in the Rio Negro valley at Rio Taruma Mirim were investigated. A community analysis consisting of the species diversity and species similarity of the aquatic and terrestrial soil fauna was executed in these forests. The annual development of the soil invertebrates was dictated by the periodic changes in water level. Data on species diversity indicated an alternate occurrence of the soil- and trunk-dwelling carabids and staphylinids (Coleoptera). Low species diversity was obtained for the aquatic soil fauna during the high water period. This was correlated with both O2 concentration and relative abundance of a few specialized species. A function model approach was tried. The phytophages and the saprophages consumed about 9.4 and 13%, respectively, of the yearly litter fall. Litter decomposition was retarded during the inundation period (170 g/m2 per s.p. was decomposed) but was accelerated during the emersion phase (420 g/m2 per e.p. was decomposed). Nearly 14% of the yearly litter fall was exported by the current from the inundation forest during the inundation phase, probably into the surroundings rivers and lakes. In the igapo the loss of some elements probably cannot be compensated for by the input from the river water and the precipitation. Unlike the igapo, the varzea forest may compensate for this loss of litter through input of nutrients from the inflowing white water. The igapo may be considered a source of nutrients while the varzea forest is a nutrient sink.																			0029-8549	1432-1939					1979	43	1					1	18		10.1007/BF00346668	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00346668								28309823					WOS:A1979HU26800001
J	Sturm, R				Sturm, Robert			Modelling ecological specificities of freshwater molluscs: the exemplary case of Bythinella austriaca (v. Frauenfeld, 1857) (Gastropoda, Prosobranchia)	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Main objective of the study was the description of Weighted Average Analysis (WAA) as appropriate mathematical method for modelling the demands of freshwater molluscs on their habitats. With this approach site-specific environmental factors defining a certain biotope are weighted by the related population density of a selected organism. This allows the determination of optimum ranges of physical and chemical factors, within which highest probabilities of occurrence of the investigated organism may be expected. As an exemplary case ecological demands of the Austrian spring snail, Bythinella austriaca, were modelled by using WAA. In addition, a global marginality coefficient, which reflects the ability of the gastropod to occupy ecological niches, and a global tolerance coefficient, describing the width of the niche colonized by the organism, were computed for 10 selected environmental factors. As suggested by the modelling results, B. austriaca exhibits specialist behaviour with regard to water temperature, electric conductivity, dissolved oxygen, total water hardness, geographic altitude, biological oxygen demand, current velocity, and dissolved nitrate. Furthermore, the gastropod only tolerates small to intermediate fluctuations of these environmental factors, which remarkably reduces its ability to act as a pioneer species.																			1129-5767	1723-8633					2016	75	3					626	633		10.4081/jlimnol.2016.1468	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2016.1468													WOS:000385855900016
J	Steissberg, TE; Hook, SJ; Schladow, SG				Steissberg, TE; Hook, SJ; Schladow, SG			Characterizing partial upwellings and surface circulation at Lake Tahoe, California-Nevada, USA with thermal infrared images	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Thermal infrared data from recently launched satellite instruments provide an opportunity to address key scientific questions and develop new applications, which could not be addressed or developed with data from earlier instruments. The satellite instruments that provide these data include ASTER, Landsat ETM+, and MODIS, and this study demonstrates bow data from them can be used to map upwelling and circulation associated with the transport of heat, solutes, and particles in lakes. Upwelling in a density-stratified water body such as a lake or reservoir results from a surface wind stress being balanced by a horizontal pressure gradient, causing denser water to rise at the upwind lake boundary. Upwellings are considered partial when intermediate-depth water reaches the surface and total when bottom water surfaces. Upwellings are an important part of ecosystem functioning, since they transport nutrients from deeper in the lake, where they accumulate, to the surface layer, where they facilitate phytoplankton growth. Thermal infrared images acquired by ASTER, ETM+, and MODIS can be used to observe partial upwelling events in lakes and provide insight into their spatial variability and horizontal distribution, information totally lacking from conventional in situ measurements. At Lake Tahoe, partial upwellings were found to occur every few days throughout the spring and summer, transporting water from 10-30 in below the surface to the surface layer. They commonly display a jet-like appearance, traveling from the upwind to the downwind side of the lake, with current speeds of 12-17 cm/s. Partial upwellings were found to generally decrease lake clarity, although deeper upwelling events can increase clarity. Sinking zones, other convergence areas, and divergence areas were also observed. The temperature variability associated with upwelling, which could be clearly mapped in the thermal infrared satellite images, illustrates the advantage of synoptic thermal infrared satellite measurements over in situ point measurements alone for detecting upwelling events, since, depending on location, an in situ instrument might not capture an upwelling event. The spatial information conveyed by the synoptic satellite measurements can be used to help improve monitoring of the clarity and general water quality of Lake Tahoe. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Wintertime Simulations of a Boreal Lake with the Canadian Small Lake Model	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												A one-dimensional mixed layer dynamic lake model is enhanced with snow and ice physics for an examination of processes governing ice cover and phenology in a small boreal lake. The complete snowpack physics module of the Canadian Land Surface Scheme along with a new snow-ice parameterization have been added to the Canadian Small Lake Model, and detailed meteorological and temperature profile data have been acquired for the forcing and evaluation of two wintertime simulations. During the first winter, simulated ice-on and ice-off biases were 23 and 25 days, respectively. In the second winter simulation, ice-on bias was larger, likely due to the absence of a frazil ice scheme in the model, and simulated ice-off was 6 days late, evidently due to insufficient convective mixing beneath the ice in the weeks leading up to ice-off. Ice cover was simulated about 25% too thin between January and March for this year, though late January simulated snow and snow-ice amounts were close to observed. The impact of snow-ice production on simulated ice cover and phenology was found to be dramatic for this lake. In the absence of this process, January snow was more than twice as deep as observed and March ice thickness was less than one-third of that observed. Without snow-ice production, a reasonable simulation of ice cover could only be restored if 62% of snowfall was removed ad hoc (e.g., through blowing snow redistribution)-an excessive amount for a small, sheltered boreal lake.

Multi-technique investigation reveals new mineral, chemical, and textural heterogeneity in the Tagish Lake C2 chondrite	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE												The Tagish Lake meteorite, an ungrouped C2 chondrite that is related to Cl and CM chondrites. is a heterogeneous accretionary breccia with several distinct lithologies that, in bulk, are thought to represent the first known sample of a primitive carbonaceous D-type asteroid. Textural and chemical zoning of clasts and matrix have been little studied and promise additional insight into early solar system processes in both the solar nebula and on the Tagish Lake parent asteroid. We have examined an intact 2.9 g fragment and two polished thin sections from the spring 2000 (non-pristine) Tagish Lake collection to ascertain the major mineralogy and textures of notable features such as chondrules, amoeboid olivine aggregates (AOAs), inclusions, clasts, matrix, and fusion crust. We designed three stages of analysis for this friable meteorite: an initial, non-destructive in situ reconnaissance by mu XRD to document meteorite mineralogy and textures and to identify features of interest, followed by spatially correlated mu XRD, SEM-EDX and colour SEM-CL analysis of polished thin sections to fully understand mineralogy and the record of texture development, and finally higher resolution SEM-BSE mapping to document smaller scale relationships. Our analyses reveal several previously unreported or poorly characterized features: (1) distinctive colour cathodoluminescence (CL) zoning in relict CAI spinel, in chondrule and AOA forsterite, and in calcite nodules occurring throughout the Tagish Lake matrix. Forsterite frequently shows CL colour and intensity zonation that does not correspond with major or minor element differences resolvable with EPMA, indicating a trace element and/or structural CL-activation mechanism for the zonation that is likely of secondary origin; (2) an irregular inclusion dominated by magnesioaluminate spinel, dolomite, and phyllosilicates with traces of a Ca, Ti oxide phase (likely perovskite) interpreted to be a relict CAI: (3) variable preservation of mesostasis glass in porphyritic olivine chondrules. We anticipate that our multi-technique methodology, particularly non-destructive mu XRD, can be successfully applied to other rare and friable materials such as the pristine Tagish Lake fragments.

Summer differences in behavioural feeding habits and use of feeding habitat among brown trout (Pisces) age classes in a temperate area	ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Field studies were conducted to examine intra-specific diet variation in a population of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) in a temperate area (River Tormes, Central Spain) during the summer. Fuzzy principal component analysis (FPCA) and the modified Costello graphical method were used to illustrate that age classes showed differences in behavioural feeding habits and use of feeding habitat. Despite benthic prey constituting the most important prey in abundance terms in all age classes, our findings suggest that ontogenetic shift among age classes can be related to several factors: (1) terrestrial invertebrates and fishes were more frequently consumed by older trout, (2) resource partitioning among age classes also occurred at the level of prey size and (3) differences among age classes in habitat utilization for feeding were evident. Levins index increases with trout size. However, a noteworthy result of this study is that no differences were found in the evenness, Shannon and Levins indices among age classes. Finally, the dietary analyses showed high values of diet overlap, but the differences in the use of feeding habitat and behavioural feeding habits are important adaptive features that may reduce the intra-specific competition in the population.

J	Adhurya, S; Das, S; Ray, S				Adhurya, Sagar; Das, Suvendu; Ray, Santanu			Nitrogen and phosphorous loading by aquatic avifauna in a shallow eutrophic freshwater lake	ENERGY ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT												Many waterbirds used to feed mainly on land but spend a considerable amount of time at waterbody for roosting. These waterbirds are known to bring a considerable amount of nutrients from terrestrial to the aquatic ecosystem with their faeces. In small waterbody, large congregations of waterbirds can cause huge nutrient loading to the lake. This sometimes may exceed 70% of the total lake nutrient budget. The present study intends to investigate the importance of waterbirds in terms of nutrient loading with faecal matter. The study was conducted at a shallow, eutrophic lake with high winter avian congregation and negligible anthropogenic nutrient input. Daily dropping production by individual waterbird, elemental concentration in dropping, individual species count and lake use pattern by waterbirds have been taken into consideration for the nutrient loading estimation by waterbird. Waterbirds were found to be the most important nutrient source to the lake, contributing about 89.5% of total nitrogen (N) and 89.9% of total phosphorous (P). Waterbirds contribute 370 kg year(-1) (17.68 g m(-2) year(-1)) and 67 kg year(-1) (3.21 g m(-2) year(-1)) of N and P, respectively, to the waterbody. Among waterbirds, Dendrocygna javanica was found to contribute the most amount of nutrients to the lake. Apart from waterbirds, precipitation was found to be the second important nutrient source to the lake. It was found that the lake receives most of the nutrients during winter due to high winter avian congregations. The present study concludes that waterbirds are the most important nutrient source for the studied lake. This study highlights the potential of waterbirds as a eutrophicating agent and future research should include it in eutrophication research if present at a high number. After all, this kind of study in the tropical/subtropical region is lacking and this study could put a light on the importance of waterbirds in this kind of system.

J	Li, LL; Li, J; Chen, HM; Yu, RC				Li, Liangliang; Li, Jian; Chen, Haoming; Yu, Rucong			Diurnal Variations of Summer Precipitation over the Qilian Mountains in Northwest China	JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH												Based on the high-density hourly rain-gauge data from 265 stations over the Qilian Mountains in Northwest China, climatic mean diurnal variations of summer rainfall over different topographies of this area are investigated. Influences of the gauge elevations on the diurnal variation of rainfall are also revealed. Distinct regional features of diurnal variations in rainfall are observed over the Qilian Mountains. Rainfall over the Qinghai Lake areas shows a single nocturnal peak. A dominant, late-afternoon peak of rainfall occurs over the mountain tops. Over the northeastern and southeastern slopes, a dominant diurnal peak appears in the late afternoon, and an evident second peak is found in the early morning, respectively. The strengths of the early-morning peaks in the rainfall frequency are closely related to the rainfall events with different durations over the two slopes. The early-morning peak is dominant across plains with low elevations. From the mountain tops to the plains, the diurnal peaks of rainfall gradually vary from the dominant late-afternoon peak to the dominant early-morning peak with the enhanced early-morning peak in concurrent with the decreasing gauge elevation over the northeastern and southeastern slopes. Further examination indicates that the rainfall at higher elevations over the northeastern and southeastern slopes occurs more readily in the afternoon, compared to the lower elevations. This phenomenon corresponds to the result that the proportion of the rainfall frequency occurring during the early-morning period decreases with increasing elevations over the two slopes.					li, liangliang/LOS-2542-2024; Li, Jian/HOC-6500-2023; Chen, Haoming/E-5716-2010														2095-6037	2198-0934				FEB	2019	33	1					18	30		10.1007/s13351-019-8103-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13351-019-8103-4													WOS:000458536300002

Reliable reconstruction of changes in monsoon precipitation during the Holocene is required to better understand the present climate conditions and to predict future climate processes in the Asian monsoon domain. Reconstruction of changes in Holocene monsoon precipitation has been done in various regions of this domain using a variety of paleoclimate proxies. However, different proxies have yielded different paleoclimate records of long-term monsoon rainfall variability. We apply compound-specific stable hydrogen isotope compositions of the plant wax n-alkanes isolated from the Hongyuan peat sequence in eastern Tibet to reevaluate the regional carbonate oxygen isotopic and lake-level records. The D/H ratios of the n-alkanes resolve the apparent discrepancy among the different paleoclimate proxies. Our result indicates that lake-level fluctuation is a reliable recorder of changes in the amount of summer monsoonal precipitation while long-term isotope records largely reflect large-scale changes in the source of water vapor rather than a local precipitation signal. Combining lake-level, biomarker, and carbonate isotopic records, we conclude that the early Holocene monsoon precipitation in southwest China has been greatly influenced by the Indian monsoon.

Clams collected in and near Winter Quarters Bay contained high levels of organochlorine compounds, particularly polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). A strong gradient has been documented in Winter Quarters Bay that been linked to human activities at McMurdo Station. The activity of clam extracts as inducers of P4501A1-dependent ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity was determined using in vitro bioassays utilizing rat hepatoma H4IIE cells. The extracts which exhibited the highest induction activities were those derived from clams collected in contaminated areas. Additionally, there was an excellent linear correlation between induced EROD activity versus total PCB levels (r2=0.96) The complimentary nature of both the analytical and bioanalytical data confirms the utility of the latter assay and provides a method for estimating the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) toxic equivalents in extracts from marine biota.

J	Bränvall, ML; Bindler, R; Emteryd, O; Renberg, I				Bränvall, ML; Bindler, R; Emteryd, O; Renberg, I			Four thousand years of atmospheric lead pollution in northern Europe:: a summary from Swedish lake sediments	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												This paper presents a large palaeolimnological study of the pre-industrial and industrial history of atmospheric lead pollution deposition in Sweden. Both lead concentrations and Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios have been analysed in 31 lakes covering most of Sweden, plus one lake in north-west Russia. Four of the lakes have varved (annually-laminated) sediments. Isotope analysis is a sensitive and effective method to distinguish pollution lead from natural catchment lead and to detect early pollution influence, because the (2)06Pb/(2)07Pb ratio in unpolluted background sediments in Sweden was > 1.3, while that of lead from pollution, derived from ores and coal, was < 1.2. The sediments show a consistent picture of past temporal changes in atmospheric lead pollution. These changes include: the first traces of pollution 3,500-3,000 yrs ago; a pollution peak in Greek-Roman Times (about 0 AD); lower lead fall-out between 400 and 900 AD; a significant and permanent increase in atmospheric lead fall-out from about 1000 AD; an increase with the Industrial revolution; a major increase following World War II; the maximum peak in the 1970s; and decreasing fall-out over the last decades. The four varved sediments provide high-resolution records of atmospheric pollution. They reveal pollution peaks about 1200 and 1530 AD which match the history of metal production in Europe. According to the varve records the lead pollution level in the late 1990s had decreased beneath the level of the 1530s. The pollution level 1200 AD was about 35% of the 1980s, when lead pollution was still near its all time high. About 50% of the total accumulated atmospheric lead pollution deposition through time was deposited in the pre-industrial period. The sediments also show a consistent picture of the geographic distribution of atmospheric lead deposition over time, with higher deposition in south Sweden and declining levels to the north, which supports the hypothesis that the main sources of pre-industrial atmospheric lead pollution in Sweden were cultural areas in mainland Europe and Great Britain.

J	Savage, AA				Savage, AA			Community structure during a 27-year study of the macroinvertebrate fauna of a chemically unstable lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Data are given on summer temperatures, conductivity, vegetation cover and the quantitative species composition of macroinvertebrates in each of the years 1968-1994. It is demonstrated that species composition, species richness and numbers of individuals varied from year to year. Community structure is expressed by species richness, species diversity, equitability and rank-abundance graphs. Species richness showed a highly significant negative correlation with conductivity and a highly significant positive correlation with vegetation cover. However, the highest significance found was with the sum of vegetation cover and the reciprocal of conductivity. Species diversity and equitability showed patterns of minima coinciding with summer temperature maxima. Rank-abundance graphs remained relatively constant throughout the study period and were used to demonstrate that a niche pre-emption model, with modification to accomodate a power graph, provided an adequate model for all years. This model suggests a deterministic explanation, but with fluctuations dependent upon random or cyclical environmental factors.																			0018-8158					MAR	2000	421						115	127		10.1023/A:1003951223718	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003951223718													WOS:000086541800011

Assessing disturbances to aquatic systems of such areas is challenging due to the low-dose, diffused, and cumulative nature of disturbances; high risk at iconic sites; and difficulty of linking human activities with degradation. Using Jiuzhaigou Nature Reserve as an example study to overcome such challenges, we developed an approach that integrated human activities known to impact aquatic systems to calculate a holistic disturbance index for assessing the extent of human uses at scales of entire reserve and individual sub-watersheds. We linked human disturbance index with benthicalgae and macroinvertebrate indicators of individual waterbodies to identify early signs of degradation. We conducted in situ nutrient experiments and intensive sampling of biota at iconic sites with early signs of degradation to provide direct linkage between tourist activities and eutrophication, and to pinpoint mechanisms of how human disturbances have resulted in such degradations. We found that the human disturbance index significantly correlated with benthic algae and macroinvertebrate indicators, and Jiuzhaigou is largely in healthy condition. For the two identified iconic sites with early signs of degradation; intensive tourist activities at observation and rest areas of Five-Color Lake seemed to link to extra amount of nitrogen input into the lake and resulted in overgrowth of phytoplankton and filamentous algae during summer peak tourist months. Extra amount of phosphorus input from tourism activities at Pearl Shoal seemed the cause of changes in substrate colors and of shifts in attached moss and algal communities. Our example study demonstrates that early signs of degradation can be visually observed and should be further assessed by measuring water quality and sensitive biological indicators at high risk areas of a waterbody during summer and peak tourist seasons. Sensitive biological indicators (e.g., intolerant diatom and macroinvertebrates) are better indicators than nutrient concentrations because of rapid assimilation of nutrients by algae and macrophytes. Our assessment approach and findings of studying Jiuzhaigou have broad applications to other protected areas for determining overuse, and hence for making science-based policy and taking adequate management actions to prevent overuses.

Uncertainty in atmospheric profiles and its impact on modeled convection development at Nam Co Lake, Tibetan Plateau	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												This work investigates the influence of atmospheric temperature and relative humidity profiles obtained from radio soundings, NCEP-I and ERA-Int reanalysis and GFS-FNL analysis data on the simulated evolution of clouds and convection at Nam Co Lake on the Tibetan Plateau. In addition to differences in moisture, the initial atmospheric profiles exhibit considerable differences in near-surface temperatures that affect vertical stability. Our analysis is carried out during 2 days in summer 2012 using a 2-D high-resolution modeling approach with a fully interactive surface model so that surface fluxes react to changes in cloud cover. Modeled convection for the radio-sounding profile compares reasonably well with weather observations for the first day, but less well for the second day, when large-scale synoptic effects, not included in the model, become more important. The choice of vertical profile information leads to strongly differing convection development, translating into modifications of the surface energy balance and of the energy and water cycle for the basin. There are strong differences spanning one order of magnitude in the generated precipitation between the model simulations driven by different vertical profiles. This highlights the importance of correct and high-resolution vertical profiles for model initialization.

Development of a Nitrogen Fertigation Program for Grape Tomato	JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION												Grape tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicon L. var. cerasiform) have recently gained in popularity among consumers because they can be eaten without being cut, they are deep red in color, and their flavor is intense and pleasant. Current nitrogen (N) fertilization recommendations were developed for determinate tomato varieties that have a 3-month long growing season, whereas that of the indeterminate grape cultivars may be up to six months. 'Tami G' grape tomatoes were grown on a Lakeland fine sand at the North Florida Research and Education CenterSuwannee Valley, near Live Oak, FL in Springs 2005 and 2006 using standard plasticulture practices under 0%, 33%, 66%, 100%, 133%, and 166% of the current recommended N rate for round tomato (224kg/ha). Due to a longer growing season in 2006, plants received an additional three weekly injections of 22 kg/ha of N each in the 100% rate, that were also proportionally applied to the other treatments. Tomatoes were transplanted March 24, 2005 and April 4, 2006 and harvested, weighed and graded five (2005) and seven (2006) times. Season marketable yield (SMY) responses to N rates were quadratic (both years P 0.01) and highest SMY (40,340 and 36,873 kg/ha) occurred with 314 and 280 kg/ha of N in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Fruit soluble solids concentrations ranged from 6.25 to 7.5, and 7.0 to 8.3 Brix in 2005 and 2006, respectively, and were not significantly affected by N rate. These results suggest that N fertilization for grape tomato grown in Spring with plasticulture could be done by incorporating 56 kg/ha of N in the bed, followed by daily rates ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 kg/ha/day. Because the length of the growing season for grape tomato may vary, emphasis should be placed on daily N rates and irrigation management, rather than on seasonal N rate.																			0190-4167	1532-4087					2008	31	12					2145	2154	PII 905122430	10.1080/01904160802460102	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904160802460102													WOS:000260680500007

Microfacies of stromatolitic Sinter from acid-sulphate-chloride springs at Parariki stream, Rotokawa Geothermal Field, New Zealand	PALAEONTOLOGIA ELECTRONICA												We present a unique, scale-integrated, and spatially controlled study of acid-derived sinters and their abiotic-biotic relations. Through a microfacies-based approach, we provide context and constraints for inferring causal factors in the formation of these sinters. Four distinct microfacies of siliceous stromatolitic sinter formation and their associated microbiota were elucidated from acid-sulphate-chloride hot spring outflows ( pH 2.1-2.3, 91-30 degrees C), located on the floodplain of Parariki Stream, similar to 1 km north of Lake Rotokawa in the Rotokawa Geothermal Field. Microfacies 1 comprises cup-to ridge-shaped sinters forming close to vents ( 91-64 degrees C) with relatively high water and gas discharge. Sinter surfaces are characterised by relatively small ( 0.5 cm high) spicules, irregular, gnarly siliceous textures and colonisation by coccoidal microorganisms ( 1-1.5 mu m in diameter). Microfacies 2 consists of spiculose ( 1 cm high) sinters colonised by bacilli ( 1-2.3 mu m long), diatoms and coccoidal algae ( 2 -10 mu m in diameter) that are surrounded by quiescent waters ( 85-30 degrees C) with little steam discharge. Microfacies 3 is typified by parallel-laminated sinters forming on slightly steepened areas that are colonised by bacilli ( 1-8 mu m long), diatoms and coccoidal algae (2-10 mu m in diameter) and exposed to fluctuating water levels ( 60-54 degrees C). Microfacies 4 constitutes thin siliceous sinter rims forming mainly on small pumiceous clasts that rest upon moist ( 67-45 degrees C) sandy substrates and colonised by bacilli ( 1-2.3 mu m long), diatoms and spherical cells (2-6 mu m in diameter). Sinter morphology, texture and formation mechanisms, as well as microbial colonisation, depend on a variety of environmental constraints that can act at a scale of centimetres or less. Textural development of the sinters, including their laminae, is attributed to a combination of abiotic and biotic factors. The differential preservation potentials of microbial communities need to be taken into account when assessing biodiversity of ancient sinters.
